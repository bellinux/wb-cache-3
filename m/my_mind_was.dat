25|$|The Director is an {{irritable}} {{and impatient}} man, his annoyance likely {{exacerbated by the}} fact that he has another appointment, “a caucus”, to attend and his time there is limited. He expresses concern with the overall appearance and demands that the coat and hat be removed leaving the man “shivering” in his “old grey pyjamas.” He has the man’s fists unclenched and then joined, the only suggestion of his Assistant’s that he pays any heed to; once arranged at breast-height he is satisfied. (Beckett explained to James Knowlson that when he was composing Catastrophe, “In <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was</b> Dupuytren’s contracture (from which I suffer) which reduces hands to claws.”) The Director dismisses his Assistant’s proposal to have the man gagged (“This craze for explicitation!”) or to “show his face … just for an instant.” He also has her make notes to whiten all the exposed flesh.|$|E

500|$|Carneiro Leão had a keen eye for {{spotting}} potential, and Paranhos—who {{had revealed}} himself a very capable man {{during his tenure}} as a Liberal politician in Rio de Janeiro province—had talents which could be put to use.

[...] Paranhos was a handsome and charming man, tall at , with blue eyes and golden hair. Historian Jeffrey D.

It's that thin, that wild mercury sound. It's metallic and bright gold, with whatever that conjures up." [...] For critics, the double album {{was seen as the}} last installment in Dylan's trilogy of mid-1960s rock albums. As Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "The three albums of this period—Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited both released in 1965, and Blonde on Blonde from 1966—used their electric instrumentation and rock arrangements to achieve a crashing exuberance Dylan hadn't approached before." [...] Mike Marqusee has described Dylan's output between late 1964 and the summer of 1966, when he recorded these three albums, as [...] "a body of work that remains unique in popular music." [...] For Patrick Humphries, [...] "Dylan's body of work during the 14-months period... stands unequalled in rock's 30-year history. In substance, style, ambition and achievement, no one has even come close to matching Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde." ...|$|E
500|$|British {{graffiti}} {{artist and}} political activist Banksy {{is credited with}} creating the opening titles and couch gag for this episode, in what amounted to {{the first time that}} an artist has been invited to storyboard the show.

According to Jean, [...] "The concept in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>was,</b> 'What if this graffiti artist came in and tagged our main titles?'" [...] Simpsons casting director Bonnie Pietila was able to contact the artist through the film's producers, and asked if he would be interested in writing a main title for the show. Jean said Banksy [...] "sent back boards for pretty much what you saw." [...] Series creator Matt Groening gave the idea his blessing, and helped try to make the sequence as close to Banksy's original storyboards as possible. Fox's standards and practices department demanded some changes, and Jean agreed to them [...] "for taste"; Jean said that [...] "95 percent of it is just the way he [...] wanted," [...] but declined to say what was in the censored 5%, only saying that the original version was [...] "even a little sadder." [...] In January 2011, Banksy published the original storyboard on his website. It appears that a poster of Rupert Murdoch could be the 5% that was left out of the final cut.|$|E
