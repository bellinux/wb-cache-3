5|$|Eddie Barlow, {{one of the}} South African {{members of}} the Rest of the World team, {{suggested}} to Sobers {{towards the end of}} the English series that the West Indian <b>might</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> take part in a friendly double-wicket competition in the Rhodesian capital Salisbury on 12 September, the local Pioneers' Day holiday. Barlow was one of several prominent South African cricketers already booked to play. Sobers was initially noncommittal, but decided to go following assurances that Rhodesia did not practise apartheid and there would be no racial discrimination regarding team selection. Sobers' intended participation became public on 7 September when a London newspaper reported on it; widespread condemnation of the West Indian captain followed, but he still travelled, landing in Salisbury early on the day of the event.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, one <b>might</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have {{a direct}} {{definition}} of the cotangent space {{without reference to the}} tangent space. Such a definition can be formulated in terms of equivalence classes of smooth functions on M. Informally, we will say that two smooth functions f and g are equivalent at a point x if they have the same first-order behavior near x, analogous to their linear Taylor polynomials; two functions f and g have the same first order behaviour near x if and only if the derivative of the function f-g vanishes at x. The cotangent space will then consist of all the possible first-order behaviors of a function near x.|$|E
25|$|Edward Perry Warren {{first saw}} Lewes House in 1889 {{and with his}} partner John Marshall they were prodigious {{collectors}} of fine antique sculpture there. Eric Gill was introduced to Warren by Roger Fry and the stone carving Ecstasy purchased, which {{is now in the}} Tate Gallery collection. William Rothenstein suggested that Warren <b>might</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> acquire Rodin's new sculpture The Kiss and after several visits, in 1904 the Lewes Kiss arrived at Lewes House. In 1906 Rodin requested that Warren lend The Kiss to an important exhibition in Regent Street, London. This made it famous in Britain for the first time. The Kiss was returned to the stables at Lewes House, where it remained until 1914 until offered to Lewes Town Council. It was placed in the Town Hall, at the South End of the Assembly Room on 2 December 1914. Early in 1915, The Kiss was wrapped in canvas and marked off with a guard rail. The Town Council returned the statue, saying only that the room did 'not lend itself to such a noble piece of statuary.' On 26 February 1917, The Kiss was once more taken to the stable block where it was to remain until Warren's death in 1928. After a short period on loan to Cheltenham, The Kiss was purchased in 1953 by public subscription and {{is now one of the}} Tate's most popular attractions.|$|E

Upon the expiration of Friedgen's contract in January 2012, Franklin will be offered the position or paid a US$1million contractual buyout. In June 2009, Friedgen said he <b>might</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> stay an additional two years past his current contract, but athletic director Deborah Yow responded that the school could not afford the buyout. She said that any extension would have to be worked out between Friedgen and Franklin.|$|E

She played Isabel, the eleven-year-old daughter of a widowed attorney turned fugitive, played by Robert Redford, who also directed the film. Jon Weisman wrote that Evancho [...] "showed she's more than a singing prodigy with her earnest sweetness". Redford cast Evancho only days before filming began. Evancho said in 2012: [...] "I don't think I want to act full-time.

500|$|In early 1949 McKenzie {{started writing}} to Albert Einstein. Her first letter to him wished him a speedy {{recovery}} from recent illness. Two of her letters {{are held in}} the Einstein archives in Jerusalem. It {{is clear from the}} second letter that he wrote back to her at least once. Some accounts claim that McKenzie corresponded regularly with Einstein for as long as 15 years before his death in 1955, but the documentary record suggests such reports exaggerate the extent of the correspondence. She also sent him several gifts over the years including shells (for his daughter) that airmen would collect across the Pacific on her request and a boomerang which had been brought to her from Central Australia by an airline pilot. She wrote that, [...] "Some of your mathematical friends <b>might</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> plot its flight!" [...] There are other reports that she sent him a didgeridoo, and a recording of didgeridoo music when he replied that he couldn't work out how to play the instrument.|$|E
500|$|An {{architect}} friend {{suggested that}} she <b>might</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> try [...] "landscape gardening" [...] (the term used at the time for landscape architecture) a field in which Beatrix Jones Farrand had become a female pioneer during the 1890s. Coffin {{may also have been}} influenced by her uncle Benjamin Church, who had worked under Frederick Law Olmsted on the creation of Central Park in New York City. Women at the time were looking beyond the traditional female careers of school teacher, nurse and office clerk, but relatively few educational institutions admitted them to study in male-dominated fields such as architecture or horticulture. One of the exceptions was the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which had begun admitting women in 1870, only nine years after its establishment. Coffin applied there but was initially refused entry, as she was not qualified to meet the admission requirements due to her lack of a formal education. However, several of the key faculty members were sympathetic and encouraged her to persevere. She undertook intensive tuition in mathematics and enrolled at MIT in 1901 as a special student, one of four women enrolled on the architecture course and one of two studying landscape architecture. The four women on the course were the only female members of a 500-strong student body.|$|E

2500|$|Investors in {{fixed-income}} securities {{are typically}} {{looking for a}} constant and secure return on their investment. For example, a retired person <b>might</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> receive a regular dependable payment to live on like gratuity, but not consume principal. This person can buy a bond with their money, and use the coupon payment (the interest) as that regular dependable payment. When the bond matures or is refinanced, the person will have their money returned to them. [...] The major investors in fixed-income securities are institutional investors, such as pension plans, mutual funds, insurance companies and others.|$|E
2500|$|Residential {{segregation}} persists for {{a variety}} of reasons. Segregated neighborhoods may be reinforced by the practice of [...] "steering" [...] by real estate agents. This occurs when a real estate agent makes assumptions about where their client <b>might</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> live based on the color of their skin. Housing discrimination may occur when landlords lie about the availability of housing based on the race of the applicant, or give different terms and conditions to the housing based on race; for example, requiring that black families pay a higher security deposit than white families.|$|E

It is the customer being in the system during the production and delivery of the service that distinguishes all services from manufacturing.|$|E
2500|$|In 1844, Heine wrote {{series of}} musical feuilletons over several {{different}} music seasons discussing {{the music of}} the day. His review of the musical season of 1844, written in Paris on April 25, 1844, is his first reference to Lisztomania, the intense fan frenzy directed toward Franz Liszt during his performances. However, Heine was not always honorable in his musical criticism. In April 1844 he wrote to Liszt suggesting that he <b>might</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> look at a newspaper review he had written of Liszt's performance before his concert; he indicated that it contained comments Liszt would not like. Liszt took this as an attempt to extort money for a positive review and did not meet Heine. Heine's review subsequently appeared on April 25 in Musikalische Berichte aus Paris and attributed Liszt's success to lavish expenditures on bouquets and to the wild behaviour of his hysterical female [...] "fans." [...] Liszt then broke relations with Heine. Liszt was not the only musician to be blackmailed by Heine for the nonpayment of [...] "appreciation money." [...] Meyerbeer had both lent and given money to Heine, but after refusing to hand over a further 500 francs was repaid by being dubbed [...] "a music corrupter" [...] in Heine's poem Die Menge tut es.|$|E
