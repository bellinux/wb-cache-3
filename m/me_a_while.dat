5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E

[...] The Fame is not about who you are—it's about how {{everybody}} wants to know who you are! Buy it and listen to it before you go out or in the car. [...] I think you've really got to allow artists' creativity to marinate. It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> but really delving into myself I finally got it. I couldn't be more proud of it. It's not just a record it's a whole pop art movement It's not just about one song." ...|$|E
500|$|A new freshman, David Banks, wrote {{a letter}} to his mother about his {{experience}} in trying out for the football team in the fall of 1901:"I am not sure whether I ought to play football or not. ... I put on Tom's suit one night and went down to the field to meet Yost and a few other men. They made me run around the track a couple times to try my wind. Then they rolled me around the ground and sat on <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> I did not understand the necessity of all they did to me, but the boys say every great player must begin that way." ...|$|E

500|$|Barlow's manager, Simon Fuller, chose Stephen Lipson {{to produce}} the song, seeing his success with 1980s artists like Grace Jones and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Although the song did not sound like what Barlow would usually record, he {{nevertheless}} explained in an interview: [...] "It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to get my interpretation right because Madonna had written from a female point of view. It's {{not the kind of}} song I would write myself. But as soon as I heard it, I thought 'This is a hit'." [...] A dance-pop song, [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] is set in the time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Barlow's voice spans between the nodes of Cm and A3 and has a basic chord progression of C–A–B–Cm in the pre-chorus and E–B–D–A–C–E–A–Cm in the chorus.|$|E
500|$|... "When {{she played}} it for me, it took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> {{to find out the}} visual {{interpretation}} that I could give back to her. And so I woke up one night and I got it, and I said, 'I got it: We have to birth a new race.' From the gate, Gaga was like, 'I want Nick Knight for this video. I want a visual.' She was always birthing something visual in her head, and Nick Knight is just, well, he's prolific but he's so genius. It was about pushing the bar of what a music video should be and can be. [...] It's a different time; it's a different era; there are no limits. It is a viral message. I think that there's something in there for everyone, and that's what's so amazing about the video and so specific about the message." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the touring cycle for Cross Purposes, bassist Geezer Butler {{quit the}} band {{for the second}} time. [...] "I finally got totally disillusioned with the last Sabbath album, and I much {{preferred}} the stuff I was writing to the stuff Sabbath were doing". Butler formed a solo project called GZR, and released Plastic Planet in 1995. The album contained the song [...] "Giving Up the Ghost", which was critical of Tony Iommi for carrying on with the Black Sabbath name, with the lyrics: You plagiarised and parodied / the magic of our meaning / a legend in your own mind / left all your friends behind / you can't admit that you're wrong / the spirit is dead and gone ("I heard it's something about me..." [...] said Iommi. [...] "I had the album given to <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> back. I played it once, then somebody else had it, so I haven't really {{paid any attention to}} the lyrics... It's nice to see him doing his own thing – getting things off his chest. I don't want to get into a rift with Geezer. He's still a friend." ...|$|E

500|$|She {{moved into}} the teen-pop genre, as she felt that {{restyling}} herself to match the image of Spears and Aguilera would help remake her career. She separated from her then-boyfriend Nick Lachey, in March 2001, feeling the need to concentrate on her career. Her new image was promoted through appearances on many events, where Simpson wore revealing outfits. The development of this image coincided with the production and release of her second studio effort, Irresistible. Simpson said {{that she wanted to}} portray a [...] "sexier, more mature style" [...] in her new album. [...] "I recorded Sweet Kisses when I was 17 years old and I'm 21 [...] so there is four years of growth involved," [...] Simpson {{said in an interview with}} Coventry Newspapers in July 2001. In an interview with Cosmopolitan in June 2001, she explained, [...] "This record is about who I am now. The music is edgier, and I'm all grown up." [...] According to Terri Doughtery, author of People in the News: Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, Simpson hoped her new image would bring more attention to the power of her voice. [...] "It's not just me singing about being in love. I also have heartbreak songs and girls telling off guys songs. It's going to take <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to recoup [...] this album, because we spent a lot of money on it," [...] Simpson said to Entertainment Weekly.|$|E
2500|$|Before joining Green Day, Tré Cool {{employed}} a more intricate drumming style. [...] He explained that [...] "When I started, I {{had too many}} drums. I was a little reggae-happy and into fancier beats than was needed. It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to get it: play the song, don't play the instrument. I started {{figuring out how to}} make the band a stronger unit, to make it jump." [...] After playing with Green Day bassist Mike Dirnt, Tré Cool adopted a more rhythmic style with fewer drum fills to match Dirnt's bass lines.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Binchy [...] "suffered {{a health}} crisis {{related to a}} heart condition", which {{inspired}} her to write Heart and Soul. The book about (what Binchy terms) [...] "a heart failure clinic" [...] in Dublin and the people involved with it, reflects many of her own experiences and observations in the hospital. Towards {{the end of her}} life, Binchy had the following message on her official website: [...] "My health isn't so good these days and I can't travel around to meet people the way I used to. But I'm always delighted to hear from readers, even if it takes <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to reply." ...|$|E

2500|$|It took an {{interval}} of eleven years, but ultimately Krugman's work on New Trade Theory (NTT) converged {{to what is}} usually called the [...] "new economic geography" [...] (NEG), which Krugman began to develop in a seminal 1991 paper, [...] "Increasing Returns and Economic Geography", published in the Journal of Political Economy. In Krugman's own words, the passage from NTT to NEG was [...] "obvious in retrospect; but it certainly took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to see it. ... The only good news was that nobody else picked up that $100 bill lying {{on the sidewalk in}} the interim." [...] This would become Krugman's most-cited academic paper: by early 2009, it had 857 citations, more than double his second-ranked paper. Krugman called the paper [...] "the love of my life in academic work." ...|$|E

Ricketts received her Bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1994, and her Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 1998. Laura talks of her own struggle to come out; [...] "I came out to my family I would say early to mid 90s. I think {{for a long time}} I wasn't really out to myself, growing up in Omaha, Neb., to a Catholic conservative family. It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to come out to myself and not long after that I came out to them. I think that it really couldn't have been a better experience. They were all immediately supportive. ... I have been really really fortunate in that regard." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Olaf," [...] she said, {{after she}} had looked at <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> rather strangely, as I thought, for the colour came and went upon her face, which in that light seemed quite young again and wonderfully beautiful, [...] "Olaf, {{you are a very}} brave man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay,' he answered, 'I {{will not}} have them see me thus with grief and terror upon my face. Whoever fears, at least I must seem brave. Walk with <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> Teule, {{and if it is}} in your mind to murder me I shall not grieve.' ...|$|E
