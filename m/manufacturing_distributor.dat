40|$|Major recent {{developments}} in the U. S. food system include the increasing presence of nontraditional grocery retailers, such as supercenters and drugstores, and competitive responses by traditional grocers, such as supermarket chains. These developments have contributed to sharp increases in concentration in the grocery retail sector, changing conventional relationships among retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers. In such a competitive domestic food market, food companies are attempting to differentiate themselves from the competition by reporting voluntary activities that demonstrate social responsibility and by more-tailored advertising campaigns and product offerings.

In this process, Organizational filters and routines are deeply involved in satisfying customer needs [23]. Organizational filters are cognitive structures that screen out information unrelated to the organization’s important tasks and help firms process consumer requests or complaints, channel them to <b>manufacturing</b> departments or <b>distributors,</b> and ensure that the current products meet consumer expectations as effectively as possible [63].

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to provide {{information}} on the conditions of horticultural products supply chain that is managed by the Cooperative Brenjonk and identifying performance problems that occur from the beginning of the process of organic products to be a viable product to be marketed. This study uses the identification of supply chain performance to determine the performance of each supply chain actors. Identification used is the identification of supply chain performance in phase 1 and 2, where the first stage of the planning elements are identified, supply, process, delivery and returns. In phase 2 conducted in-depth identification of the identification performance on stage 1. Respondents experts used are the primary members of the supply chain of horticultural products. Performed on the identification results obtained in phase 1 that each actor has a horticulture supply chain constraints on the 5 elements namely supplier with 12 obstacles, with 14 <b>manufacturing</b> constraints, <b>distributors</b> and retailers with a 3 constraint with 4 constraints. Constraints are most numerous in the manufacturing and the most dominant elements contained in the make. The results of the first stage followed by analysis of the phase 2. Stage 2 found elements that affect the source-stocked-product (S 1), make-to-order (M 2), delivering on-stocked product (D 1) and return defective product (SR 1) and deliver excess return product (DR 3) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{linkage between}} raw {{resources}} consumption {{and economic growth}} through product manufacture and disposal is creating an untenable pressure on the planet’s natural systems; therefore understanding and embracing {{the mechanics of the}} biology and physics of our context could lead to novel approaches in the design of human-built systems/products. Designers are, by active association, responsible for that pressure and much of the impact {{can be traced back to}} the early stages of the design process. For designers and engineers the main constraint is accessibility to knowledge of multiple and complex factors in easily digestible form when starting a project. Added to this is the possibility to transcend the realm of products and explore creative solutions throughout the entire life cycle, giving designers the opportunity to propose entire new business models and systems. This paper exposes the search for an intuitive soft modeling tool that considers some of these factors and inspires the innovation of business and systems innovation from a biophysical perspective. The aim of this tool is to enable the exploration of these factors in a playful intuitive way and relate these outcomes to the design of a business model operating within the principles of trophic levels. The first key question to the development of this approach has been: how does it work in nature? Organisms search for their food in other organisms and at the same time are the food of others; biomass and energy are transferred from one level to another, losses occur, higher qualities of energy are created and all is maintained in continuous cycles. The linear human production of goods can be rethought by taking into account this basic principle of thermodynamics and although this is not a technological problem, the relevant constrains need to be integrated for this approach to be feasible. These are from an economics origin: how to achieve a healthy business from a non-linear process? It is proposed that an analogy between natural and human systems: autotrophs = <b>manufacturing,</b> heterotrophs = <b>distributors</b> and consumers, their concentration and size, their possible combinations and their eventual business interpretations, is referred to as Trophic Economics. The envisioned tool will combine the exploration of the complex factors involved in the lifecycle of a product with the suggested Trophic Economics models. The outcome could be sketches of the possible boundaries and structures of new business and products, to be resolved later on the drawing board. In order to measure and keep track of the most relevant decisions, a designer must embrace tools like emergy accounting, MIPS and MI (Wuppertal Institute, 2002) used in related combination, plus indexes of CO 2 emissions and relevant economic, social-demographic and ecosystems information about the countries involved in any give proposition of manufacture and use...|$|R
