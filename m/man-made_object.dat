It revealed {{the presence of the}} solar wind and performed the first fly-by of the planet Venus, although contact was lost before reaching Venus. The first successful planetary mission was the Mariner 2 fly-by of Venus in 1962. The first {{spacecraft to}} perform a fly-by of Mars was Mariner 4, which reached the planet in 1964. Since that time, unmanned spacecraft have successfully examined each of the Solar System's planets, as well their moons and many minor planets and comets. They remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space, as well as observation of the Earth. In August 2012, Voyager 1 became the first <b>man-made</b> <b>object</b> to leave the Solar System and enter interstellar space.|$|E

25|$|The USSR {{intended}} {{to have the}} first artificial satellite of Mars beating the planned American Mariner 8 and Mariner 9 Mars orbiters. In May 1971, one day after Mariner 8 malfunctioned at launch and failed to reach orbit, Cosmos 419 (Mars 1971C), a heavy probe of the Soviet Mars program M-71, also failed to launch. This spacecraft was designed as an orbiter only, while the next two probes of project M-71, Mars 2 and Mars 3, were multipurpose combinations of an orbiter and a lander with small skis-walking rovers {{that would be the}} first planet rovers outside the Moon. They were successfully launched in mid-May 1971 and reached Mars about seven months later. On November 27, 1971 the lander of Mars 2 crash-landed due to an on-board computer malfunction and became the first <b>man-made</b> <b>object</b> to reach the surface of Mars. On 2 December 1971, the Mars 3 lander became the first spacecraft to achieve a soft landing, but its transmission was interrupted after 14.5 seconds.|$|E

500|$|Each of {{the three}} {{services}} has its own intelligence collection assets. RAN doctrine states that [...] "all maritime units" [...] contribute to the collection of intelligence {{and many of the}} RAN's ships are capable of collecting communications and electronic transmissions. The Collins class submarines are particularly effective in this role. The Army's intelligence and surveillance units include the 1st Intelligence Battalion, 7th Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare), three Regional Force Surveillance Units and the Special Air Service Regiment. The RAAF monitors the airspace of Australia and neighbouring countries using the Vigilare system, which combines input from the service's Jindalee Operational Radar Network, other ADF air defence radars (including airborne and naval systems) and civilian air traffic control radars. The RAAF's other intelligence assets include No. 87 Squadron and the AP-3C Orion aircraft operated by No. 92 Wing. A Space Situational Awareness capability is currently being installed at Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt to allow the tracking of space assets and debris. Australia also provides personnel to the US Joint Space Operations Center in Colorado Springs which tracks and identifies any <b>man-made</b> <b>object</b> in orbit.|$|E

40|$|This {{letter is}} {{dedicated}} to an automated approach for the detection and classification of <b>man-made</b> <b>objects</b> in urban corridors from point clouds acquired by vehicle–borne Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS). The approach is designed based on a-priori knowledge in urban areas: (i) <b>man-made</b> <b>objects</b> feature geometric regularity like vertical planar structures (e. g. building facades), while vegetation reveals a huge diversity in shape and point distribution; (ii) different types of urban <b>man-made</b> <b>objects</b> can be characterized by the point extension and height above the ground. Therefore, MLS-based point clouds are first divided into three layers {{with respect to the}} vertical height dimension. In each layer, seed points of <b>man-made</b> <b>objects</b> are indicated by a line-filter in the footprints of off-ground objects which is generated by binarizing the spatial accumulation map of point clouds. These seed points are further classified by examining in which layers the seed points of objects are found. Finally, points belonging to respective objects can be retrieved based on classified seed points. The experiments show that various <b>man-made</b> <b>objects</b> on both street sides can be well detected with a detection rate of up to 83 %. For the classification of detected urban objects, an overall accuracy of 92. 37 % can be achieved...|$|R

[...] Global Security cites a 2011-01 Journal of Rocket propulsion that articulates the need for 620+ launches of their Long March-9 (CZ-9) heavy lift system for the construction of an orbital solar power plant with 10,000 MW capacity massing 50,000 tonnes.|$|E

The {{far side of the}} Moon was first photographed on October 7, 1959, by the Soviet probe Luna 3. Though vague by today's standards, the photos showed that {{the far side of the}} Moon almost completely lacked maria. In an effort to compete with these Soviet successes, U.S. President John F. Kennedy proposed the national goal of landing a human on the Moon. Speaking to a Joint Session of Congress on May 26, 1961, he said [...] "First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space." [...] The Soviets nonetheless remained in the lead for some time. Luna 9 was the first probe to soft land on the Moon and transmit pictures from the lunar surface on February 3, 1966. It was proven that a lunar lander would not sink into a thick layer of dust, as had been feared. The first artificial satellite of the Moon was the Soviet probe Luna 10, launched March 31, 1966.|$|E
