5|$|According to the 2018 {{edition of}} R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, only the pieces from 1882 to 1887 catalog {{for more than}} $100 in worn Good-4 condition; common dates list for $15 to $20 in that condition. The highest value listed is for the 1877, struck only in proof with a <b>mintage</b> of 900, at $2,000. David F. Fanning, in his 2001 article on the three-cent pieces, {{suggested}} that rarer specimens of the nickel three-cent piece are relatively inexpensive compared with coins of similar <b>mintage</b> in more popular series, such as the Morgan dollar.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 162,099 Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint in April and May, 1925, with 99 pieces {{set aside for}} {{inspection}} and testing by the 1926 Assay Commission. The coins were made from blanks, or planchets, that had been intended for <b>mintage</b> into 1924 Stone Mountain Memorial half dollars, but had not been used.|$|E
5|$|Bullion {{deposits}} {{continued to}} decline, and in 1797, silver dollar production reached {{the lowest point}} since 1794 with a <b>mintage</b> of just 7,776 pieces. During this time, silver deposits declined {{to such an extent}} that Thomas Jefferson personally deposited 300 Spanish dollars in June 1797. In April 1797, an agreement was reached between the Mint and the Bank of the United States. The Bank agreed to supply the Mint with foreign silver on the condition that the Bank would receive their deposits back in silver dollars. The Mint was closed between August and November 1797 due to the annual yellow fever epidemic in Philadelphia; that year's epidemic took the life of the Mint's treasurer, Dr. Nicholas Way. In November 1797, the Bank deposited approximately $30,000 worth of French silver. In early 1798, the reverse was changed from the small, perched eagle to a heraldic eagle similar to that depicted on the Great Seal of the United States. The agreement reached with the Bank of the United States along with other bullion depositors (including Boudinot) led to an increase in the number of silver dollars coined; <b>mintage</b> for both the small and heraldic eagle types totalled 327,536. <b>Mintage</b> numbers for the dollar remained high through 1799, with 423,515 struck that year.|$|E

5|$|On March 12, Ashbrook {{submitted}} {{a report on}} behalf of his committee recommending passage of the bill once it had been amended to reduce the authorized <b>mintage</b> from 200,000 to 100,000 and to add a statement that the United States government would not be responsible for the cost of the dies.|$|E
5|$|Yeoman lists all three-cent pieces before 1863 at $40 in worn G-4 condition, {{except the}} 1851 through 1853 at Philadelphia ($25). All three-cent pieces from 1863 to 1872 are less {{valuable}} in proof than in uncirculated MS-63 condition. Much of the <b>mintage</b> of later dates were melted by the Mint {{after the end}} of the series.|$|E
5|$|A {{commemorative}} half {{dollar for}} {{the battle was}} produced in 1936. As was typical for the period, <b>mintage</b> for the coin was very low, just 26,928. On January 24, 2011, the America the Beautiful quarters released a 25-cent coin commemorating Gettysburg National Military Park and the Battle of Gettysburg. The reverse {{side of the coin}} depicts the monument on Cemetery Ridge to the 72nd Pennsylvania Infantry.|$|E
2500|$|When {{originally}} published, Dalton and Hamer assigned rarity {{information to}} each token {{based on the}} number minted with each die pairing, and with each edge type. [...] Over time some of these estimates {{have been found to be}} overestimates of <b>mintages,</b> whereas others have underestimated <b>mintages.</b> [...] Tokens are classified into large groups called [...] "Common", [...] "Scarce", [...] "Rare", [...] "Very Rare", and [...] "Extremely Rare". [...] While some tokens are classified as rare based only on their varied edge lettering, the more sought after tokens are those with very small <b>mintages</b> of a particular obverse and/or reverse design.|$|R

5|$|In 1898, Congress {{approved}} {{a bill that}} required all remaining bullion purchased under the Sherman Silver Purchase Act to be coined into silver dollars. When those silver reserves were depleted in 1904, the Mint ceased to strike the Morgan dollar. The Pittman Act, passed in 1918, authorized the melting and recoining of millions of silver dollars. Pursuant to the act, Morgan dollars resumed <b>mintage</b> for one year in 1921. The design {{was replaced by the}} Peace dollar later the same year.|$|E
5|$|In March 1877, Linderman {{authorized}} the melting of 12,359 twenty-cent pieces at Carson City. This included {{almost the entire}} <b>mintage</b> from 1876 (about 10,000) and created {{one of the great}} American numismatic rarities, the 1876-CC twenty-cent piece. Fewer than two dozen are known; one sold at auction for $564,000 in 2013, making it the record-holder for the denomination. In her 2003 article, numismatist Michele Orzano suggests that the few survivors were souvenirs obtained by visitors to the mint.|$|E
5|$|The Draped Bust {{dollar is}} a United States dollar coin minted from 1795 to 1803, and was reproduced, dated 1804, into the 1850s. The design succeeded the Flowing Hair dollar, which began <b>mintage</b> in 1794 {{and was the}} first silver dollar struck by the United States Mint. The {{designer}} is unknown, though the distinction is usually credited to artist Gilbert Stuart. The model is also unknown, though Ann Willing Bingham has been suggested.|$|E

5|$|The coins {{were struck}} in August 1925 in San Francisco, and were sold the {{following}} month. They did not sell {{as well as}} hoped: only some 150,000 of the authorized <b>mintage</b> of 300,000 were ever struck, and of that, nearly half went unsold and were melted. The coin is catalogued at between $200 and $1,300, though exceptional specimens have sold for more.|$|E
5|$|The medallions were {{initially}} sold through mail order; purchasers {{were required to}} obtain the day's price by telephone before ordering. Later, the Mint sold them through telemarketing. <b>Mintage</b> ceased after the ten different medallions approved by Congress were produced. All were struck at the West Point Bullion Depository. The series sold poorly, prompting critics to blame the involved process by which they were first marketed, {{and the fact that}} they were medallions rather than coins.|$|E
5|$|The series proved unpopular in {{everyday}} commerce. <b>Mintage</b> dropped by 90% the following year. From 2002 through 2008, Sacagawea dollars were only struck {{for sale to}} collectors. The Federal Reserve Bank ordered none of the Native American series after their issuance beginning in 2009. In December 2009, it was noted by a Federal Reserve official that there were currently 857,000,000-dollar coins (including Presidential dollars) in government storage vaults, an amount estimated to satisfy the demand for twelve years.|$|E

In 1908, {{it was discovered that}} ten proofs dated 1884 and five dated 1885 were produced, but these pieces are not listed in official records and it is unknown when they were created.|$|E
5|$|With the New Year, {{the coins}} were dated 1893; just over four {{million of the}} {{authorized}} <b>mintage</b> were struck with an 1893 date, with the remainder dated 1892. A total of 5,002,105 Columbian half dollars were struck, with the excess over the authorized <b>mintage</b> designated for inspection by the annual Assay Commission. By February 1893, sales had fallen off dramatically. The Exposition Company deposited 2,000,000 half dollars in Chicago banks as security for loans. In March, Congress impounded an additional 1,141,700 half dollars to cover costs advanced by the government, such as the expense of judging exhibits and providing medals to the exhibitors. The Company could redeem the half dollars if it agreed to fund that expense, which it refused to do, calling the government's action a breach of faith. In return, the Company stated {{it was no longer}} bound by a provision of the 1892 act, which forbade the fair from opening on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|After a small {{quantity}} {{was struck}} for circulation, the Mint received complaints regarding the prominent placement of Gobrecht's {{name on the}} dollar, and the design was modified to incorporate his name in a less conspicuous position. In January 1837, the legal standard for the percentage of precious metal in silver coins was changed from 89.2% to 90%, and the Gobrecht dollars struck after that point reflect this change. In total, 1,900 Gobrecht dollars were struck during the official production run. Production of the Seated Liberty dollar, which utilized the same obverse design as the Gobrecht dollar, began <b>mintage</b> in 1840. In the 1850s, Mint officials controversially re-struck the coins without authorization.|$|E

5|$|By mintages, the {{key dates}} {{in this series}} are the 1948, 1949-S, 1953 and 1955. Franklin half dollars have been {{extensively}} melted for their silver, and many dates are rarer than the <b>mintage</b> figures indicate. For example, although more than nine million 1962 halves were struck for circulation, and an additional three million in proof, the coin was more valuable as bullion than in any condition when silver prices reached record levels in 1979–1980. In 2010, the 1962 half in MS-65 condition sold for about US$145, {{second only to the}} 1953-S in price in that grade.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{began the}} task of {{restoring}} federal coins to circulation in 1864 with a two-cent piece in bronze, and by authorizing a three-cent piece in copper-nickel the following year. In 1866, it authorized a five-cent piece in the latter alloy, the nickel, as {{it has come to}} be known. With the three-cent silver effectively replaced by base-metal pieces, it did not share in the increased <b>mintage</b> of silver coins that began in 1868. The three-cent silver was struck at the rate of a few thousand per year into the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their initial}} lack of popularity, {{by the late}} 1990s the Treasury's supply of Anthony dollars began to dwindle due to their {{widespread}} use in vending machines (including more than 9,000 stamp machines situated in post offices across the United States) and mass transit turnstiles. Beginning in 1997, several bills were introduced to Congress {{with the intent of}} resuming <b>mintage</b> of small-sized dollar coins to keep up with demand. On March 20 of that year, Arizona Republican Representative Jim Kolbe introduced legislation calling for more dollar coins to be minted. Four months later, on July 24, Republican Representative Michael Castle of Delaware, a member of the House Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, also introduced legislation, calling for the Statue of Liberty to be the subject of the design. On October 21, Minnesota Republican Rod Grams introduced a bill in the Senate, also calling for the <b>mintage</b> of a newly designed dollar coin. The final legislation authorizing the design and production of a new dollar coin was based on Grams' bill. Also on October 21, in a hearing before the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade, and Technology, Treasury Department officials gave their support for a new dollar coin, recommending that it be gold-colored with a distinctive edge, to make it easily distinguishable from the quarter-dollar. During this hearing, Philip N. Diehl, then Director of the Mint, estimated that it would take thirty months to begin production of the new coin.|$|E
2500|$|The 1940 Denver Mint, 1936 Denver {{mint and}} the 1935 Denver Mint coins, {{as well as}} many others in the series, are {{considerably}} more valuable than other coins. This is not due to their <b>mintages,</b> but rather because they are harder to find in high grades (a situation referred to as [...] "condition rarity"). Many of these coins are worth only melt value in low grades. Other coins in the above list are expensive because of their extremely low <b>mintages,</b> such as the 1932 Denver and San Francisco issues. The overstruck mintmark issues are also scarce and expensive, especially in the higher grades; even so they may not have the same popularity as overdates found in pre-Washington quarter series.|$|R
