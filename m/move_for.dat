5|$|Former {{chairman}} Eggert Magnússon {{made clear}} his ambition for West Ham {{to move to}} the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Summer Olympics, a desire reiterated by current chairmen Gold and Sullivan when they assumed control of the club stating that they felt it was a logical <b>move</b> <b>for</b> the Government {{as it was in the}} borough of Newham.|$|E

The match itself raised £30,000 for the four Home Nations Football Associations, and since the eleven British players received £14 each, Matthews questioned where exactly this money ended up – he doubted that much of it ended up as funding for grass-roots football.|$|E

The blood bank <b>moved</b> <b>for</b> judgment notwithstanding the verdict and also <b>moved</b> <b>for</b> an amended judgment {{on the grounds that the}} damages awarded were in excess of those allowed under the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act (MICRA). The trial court acknowledged that it had erred when it had held that MICRA did not apply, and the blood bank <b>moved</b> <b>for</b> a new trial.|$|R

5|$|The {{motivation}} for enpassant was {{to prevent the}} newly added two-square first <b>move</b> <b>for</b> pawns from allowing a pawn to evade capture by an enemy pawn. Asian chess variants, because of their separation from European chess prior to that period, do not feature any of these moves.|$|E
5|$|After being {{selected}} by the Canucks, Gradin brokered a <b>move</b> <b>for</b> Edler to play with Modo Hockey's junior club of the J20 SuperElit. Edler had previously tried out for Modo's youth program, but was cut. Future Canucks teammates Markus Näslund, Henrik Sedin and Daniel Sedin had also played in the Modo system before joining the NHL. In Edler's lone season with Modo, he recorded eight goals and 23 points over 33 games in 2004–05. He ranked second in point-scoring among league defensemen to Modo teammate Tommy Enström, who recorded 33.|$|E

5|$|Allowing the enpassant capture, {{together}} {{with the introduction of}} the two-square first <b>move</b> <b>for</b> pawns, {{was one of the last}} major rule changes in European chess, and occurred between 1200 and 1600. Other relatively recent rule changes were castling, the unlimited range for queens and bishops (Spanish master Ruy López de Segura gives the rule in his 1561 book Libro de la invencion liberal y arte del juego del axedrez) and a change to the rules on pawn promotion. In most places the en passant rule was adopted at the same time as allowing the pawn to move two squares on its first move, but it was not universally accepted until the Italian rules were changed in 1880.|$|E
5|$|Despite the setback, {{the team}} {{returned}} to the Eastern Conference Finals during the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season and defeated the Philadelphia Flyers four games to two. They swept the heavily favored Detroit Red Wings to win New Jersey's first-ever Stanley Cup, as they brought the Cup across the Hudson River from New York, after the Rangers had won it the year before. The 1995 Devils team became the first to give the players a day with the Stanley Cup, a tradition that lives on with each Cup winner. Claude Lemieux was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoffs MVP. The success came amid constant rumors that the team would <b>move</b> <b>for</b> {{the third time in}} its history to Nashville.|$|E

As Vietnamization had reduced {{the visibility of}} the anti-war movement, and Shoup's criticism was not as prominent in the public arena. Fulbright and other senators urged the White House {{to listen to his}} criticisms, but Shoup's broader critique of American society and militarism was seen as more extreme than other officers who had simply criticized the strategy of the war.|$|E

5|$|The {{forewings}} of beetles are {{not used}} for flight, but form elytra which cover the hind {{part of the body}} and protect the hindwings. The elytra are usually hard shell-like structures which must be raised to allow the hind wings to <b>move</b> <b>for</b> flight. However, in the soldier beetles (Cantharidae), the elytra are soft, earning this family the name of leatherwings. Other soft wing beetles include the net-winged beetle Calopteron discrepans, which has brittle wings that rupture easily in order to release chemicals for defence.|$|E
5|$|Their 2000's demo was {{followed}} by a full-length album released through Prime Directive Records entitled Dust to Ashes in April 2001. Just prior to entering the studio, Vijay Kumar (of Roundhouse and Cat Burglar) took the bass position and Molly Street enrolled as keyboard player. The addition of keyboards was an unconventional <b>move</b> <b>for</b> a metalcore act as it brought some black metal influences into the music. Just as the album saw issue Born quit the band but a quickfire substitute was located in Derek Youngsma of Cast in Stone repute.|$|E
5|$|When {{his brother}} and {{sister-in-law}} were forced to <b>move</b> <b>for</b> business reasons, he bought his own house at 328 Mickle Street (now 330 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard). First {{taken care of by}} tenants, he was completely bedridden for {{most of his time in}} Mickle Street. During this time, he began socializing with Mary Oakes Davis—the widow of a sea captain. She was a neighbor, boarding with a family in Bridge Avenue just a few blocks from Mickle Street. She moved in with Whitman on February 24, 1885, to serve as his housekeeper in exchange for free rent. She brought with her a cat, a dog, two turtledoves, a canary, and other assorted animals. During this time, Whitman produced further editions of Leaves of Grass in 1876, 1881, and 1889.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} Pokémon {{role-playing}} games released for handheld consoles, FireRed and LeafGreen are in third-person, overhead perspective. The main screen is an overworld, {{in which the}} player navigates the protagonist. Here a menu interface may be accessed, in which the player may configure his or her Pokémon, items, and gameplay settings. When the player encounters a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen that displays the player's Pokémon and the engaged Pokémon. During a battle, the player may select a <b>move</b> <b>for</b> his or her Pokémon to perform, use an item, switch his or her active Pokémon, or attempt to flee. All Pokémon have hit points (HP); when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an enemy Pokémon faints, all of the player's Pokémon involved in the battle receive {{a certain amount of}} experience points (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a Pokémon may level up.|$|E
5|$|Decades later, {{during the}} {{production}} of Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1987, the Disney studio resurrected Beauty and the Beast as a project for the satellite animation studio it had set up in London, England to work on Roger Rabbit. Richard Williams, who had directed the animated portions of Roger Rabbit, was approached to direct but declined in favor of continuing work on his long-gestating project The Thief and the Cobbler. In his place, Williams recommended his colleague, English animation director Richard Purdum, and work began under producer Don Hahn on a non-musical version of Beauty and the Beast set in 19th century France. At the behest of Disney CEO Michael Eisner, Beauty and the Beast became the first Disney animated film to use a screenwriter. This was an unusual production <b>move</b> <b>for</b> an animated film, which is traditionally developed on storyboards rather than in scripted form. Linda Woolverton wrote the original draft of the story before storyboarding began, and worked with the story team to retool and develop the film.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Juggernaut also competed as a singles wrestler. On September 12, 1999, he {{defeated}} Michelle Starr {{to win the}} NWA/ECCW Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship. The following month, {{he dropped}} the belt to Johnny Canuck in a three way match. He regained the belt in a rematch but was stripped of the title in December. A tournament was held for the vacant championship, which Juggernaut won to regain the title. He then became involved in a feud with Kurrgan, and the two traded the belt back and forth. Kurrgan beat Juggernaut for the title on February 25, 2000, but Juggernaut won it back two months later. He held the belt for a day before dropping it back to Kurrgan. When Kurrgan was stripped of the title for being unable to compete at a show in July, Juggernaut won the vacant championship by defeating Leatherface (Rick Patterson). At Juggernaut's request, the match was a {{two out of three}} falls tables match. During the match, he was legitimately unable to <b>move</b> <b>for</b> several minutes and suffered memory loss after Leatherface hit him with a chair.|$|E

5|$|From {{the five}} on the shortlist, two sites were considered, the Cathays Park Building and Cardiff City Hall. Cardiff City Hall was favoured because the {{executive}} and legislative functions would be separated, Cardiff City Hall was more widely recognised by the Welsh public and was a more prestigious building compared with the Cathays Park Building. The move to Cardiff City Hall would have also avoided a disruptive <b>move</b> <b>for</b> Welsh Office staff at the Cathays Park Building. The Welsh Office concluded that Cardiff City Hall would only remain an option if the initial costs were £17M or less, which was the top end of the estimate figure given in the white paper. This would only be possible if essential works were carried out immediately and {{the remainder of the}} work carried out later. Cardiff Council would need to agree a selling price of £5M or less for this to be possible.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a new {{contract}} was signed between the Lebanese Directorate General of General Security (DGGS) with a Lebanese company Inkript, a member of Resource Group Holding (RGH), to make the <b>move</b> <b>for</b> biometric passports. Inkript held {{a joint venture with}} French firm Gemalto, based in the Netherlands to participate in the tender. Jacques Seif, General Manager of Inkript, said: “We will handle all the programming and software development in-house, while Gemalto will be in charge of manufacturing the passports and matching the program’s interface with the coding machines.”. The contract’s term is three years, and Inkript will produce four million Lebanese biometric passports. The contract, valued at around 140 million US dollars, was funded by a Saudi grant. The Lebanese Directorate General of General Security (DGGS) announced that it would be issuing biometric passports to all of its citizens starting from July 2016.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Booker {{attended}} a {{dinner at a}} conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, where he was seated with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg, who had no known ties to Newark, announced in September 2010 that he was donating $100 million of his personal fortune to the Newark school system. According to an article in the New York Times, Booker and Zuckerberg continued their conversation about Booker's plans for Newark. The initial gift was made to start a foundation for education. The gift was formally announced when Booker, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and Zuckerberg appeared together on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The timing of Zuckerberg's donation was questioned by some as a <b>move</b> <b>for</b> damage control to his image, as it was announced on the opening day of the movie The Social Network, a film that painted an unflattering portrait of Zuckerberg. On her show, however, Winfrey told the audience that Zuckerberg and Booker had been in talks for months and had actually planned the announcement for the previous month, and that she and Booker had to force Zuckerberg to put his name to the donation, which he had wanted to make anonymously.|$|E
