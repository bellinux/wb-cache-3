The UK expects {{to complete their}} smart <b>meter</b> <b>roll</b> out by 2020, which potentially provides half-hourly load readings for households. Each household represents a separately metered point on the network, and is allocated a unique meter point administration number (MPAN). Smart meter data helps DNOs assess the LV network headroom [10], the effect of energy storage [8], and the network renewable capacity [11]. However, a DNO is charged for smart meter data [1] so approximations to half-hourly household demand are required, which is a not-trivial task since load on this individual level is volatile.|$|R

40|$|Even though {{energy market}} has been opened up since 1999 in UK, many of the {{residential}} consumers are still locked-in with their former regional monopoly supplier. This {{is largely due to}} switching costs which are viewed as substantial in this industry and inhibit consumer from switching to other energy suppliers. Where switching costs do seem to distort competitive process, the mandate of rolling out smart meter in all Great Britain (GB) household by 2020 reduces the switching cost as part of its benefit to encourage consumers switching. This move by the government will cause an impact on energy suppliers as the industry will be more highly competitive. As such, the objective {{of this paper is to}} examine the impact of smart <b>meter</b> <b>roll</b> out that are likely to have on energy suppliers. This is achieved through identifying multiple switching costs dimensions in today energy industry and the determinants of customer retention. Findings in this study show that the main driver in consumer switching is cost savings. Consumers are looking for cost savings of £ 100 - 120 per year as a motivation to switch reflects substantial switching cost in the energy industry which require significant amount of reward to compensate them. Given that switching process is easy, most of the respondents will still choose not to switch if the savings from switching is not significant. This is because consumers also have to invest enormous effort and time in searching and comparing deals. Pricing uncertainty in the industry also makes it difficult for consumers to switch and has led to the attitude that switching energy supplier would not give them any gain as price difference is transitory. It has found that customer retention is also influenced by other factors such as tenure, experience in switching and demographic attributes. Though smart <b>meter</b> <b>roll</b> out reduces transactional costs in switching, energy suppliers could still determine the size of other switching costs dimensions to their advantage. Due to its strategic importance, this paper also offers a recommended framework developed for E. ON to effectively manage and utilise switching costs opportunities to create and sustain competitive advantage for the firm. However, it is unlikely competition alone would keep prices down and increase consumers‟ likelihood to switch for maximum gain available unless there is a change in customers‟ perception. Hence, the success of smart meter initiative is still significantly determined by consumer behaviour which drives industry performance...|$|R

5000|$|... 3. PrintingA flexographic {{print is}} made by {{creating}} a positive mirrored master of the required image as a 3D relief in a rubber or polymer material. Flexographic plates can be created with analog and digital platemaking processes. The image areas are raised above the non image areas on the rubber or polymer plate. The ink is transferred from the ink roll which is partially immersed in the ink tank. Then it transfers to the anilox or ceramic <b>roll</b> (or <b>meter</b> <b>roll)</b> whose texture holds a specific amount of ink since it is covered with thousands of small wells or cups that enable it to meter ink to the printing plate in a uniform thickness evenly and quickly (the number of cells per linear inch can {{vary according to the}} type of print job and the quality required). To avoid getting a final product with a smudgy or lumpy look, it must be ensured that the amount of ink on the printing plate is not excessive. This is achieved by using a scraper, called a doctor blade. The doctor blade removes excess ink from the anilox roller before inking the printing plate. The substrate is finally sandwiched between the plate and the impression cylinder to transfer the image. The sheet is then fed through a dryer, which allows the inks to dry before the surface is touched again. If a UV-curing ink is used, the sheet {{does not have to be}} dried, but the ink is cured by UV rays instead.|$|R

The main reason for governing bodies impose regulations is to reduce harmful emissions and also secure energy resources for future. This initiative of installing smart meter in every household is also linked to strengthening UK governments’ commitment to achieve its set target in reducing energy usage while empowering consumer with clear information of their usage and thus make a conscious effort to use, only required amount of energy. (DECC, 2010) This initiative is expected to affect energy utility industry in many ways now and in future, first major implication of this initiative is launch of a nationwide meter replacement campaign where suppliers are expected to replace every electricity and gas meter with smart meter in all their domestic customer. Making a huge challenge to suppliers who not only need to adopt to new technology and include it in their process but also convince customer to actively take part in the campaign. Consultation and study carried out by government regulatory organizations like Ofgem and DECC has showed that major part of success in this initiative can be derived only when customer fully engages with the program hence the challenge is to educate the customer on smart meter.

In case of pure loss of stability in following and quartering seas, delegation of Japan and USA proposed vulnerability criteria level one based on the hull form characteristics of ships.

Two degree of freedom model is used to investigate the roll motion characteristics. The irregular wave is developed by using the ITTC wave spectrum and the linear and nonlinear damping coefficients of roll are estimated by using the Ikeda semi empirical method.

40|$|Mark Gregory for The Conversation {{talks in}} terms of the privacy laws Origin Energy new online {{monitoring}} system and the issues it may face..  Origin Energy, Australia’s pre-eminent energy retailer, launched an online energy-use monitoring portal Origin Smart. All good – but what about the the privacy and security of the data being collected and made available? Origin Smart is a website that lets Origin’s Victorian customers to see their home electricity usage updated every half hour. The electricity usage information comes from the new smart <b>meters</b> that were <b>rolled</b> out over the past six years. Victorian customers (and then customers nationally) will be able to view their electricity usage for up to 24 hours prior to the current half-hourly reading. Other energy companies, including United Energy, are {{in the final stages of}} testing a portal similar to Origin Smart. What you’re getting The Origin Smart portal provides customers with an estimate of future electricity bills and the capability to set daily electricity consumption targets. But the value of Energy Smart is yet to be identified because customers may need to see historical energy usage data – beyond the current one-day provided – to gain an understanding of their energy usage over time and to be able to make informed decisions. Customers will be also able to compare their usage with households of a similar size and occupancy. This all sounds fine, right? I mean, who wouldn’t want to know how much energy they’re using? But, as mentioned above, there are bigger issues at play here, involving privacy and security. Risk of a cyber-attack? In recent weeks I have written on The Conversation about cybercrime and cyber-terrorism laws. The Cybercrime Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 increases the scope of customer data that carriers and internet service providers (ISPs) must collect when notified by police or security organisations. Proposed changes to cybersecurity laws include a provision for a two-year internet data retention requirement for all Australians. How is this relevant to Origin Smart? Well, I’ve received several requests for an example of a national network-related privacy and security problem. I submit Origin Smart. Origin Smart has all the characteristics of an information store that will be a target for hackers. Knowledge is power and information about customers 2 ̆ 7 electricity usage is a saleable commodity. Information about electricity usage for business, government, defence and national infrastructure is of value to hackers and terrorists. (Origin Energy hasn’t made it clear whether Origin Smart will be available only to residential customers.) Will Anonymous target Origin Smart as part of its current Operation Australia campaign? I don’t see why not. Victorian customers can access the portal from any internet-connected computer. The portal does not utilise two-step authentication – that is, a second layer of security (such as being sent a password by text message) that makes a security breach less likely. By contrast, most Australian banks and many online services, including Google and Dropbox, do use two-step authentication. Failure to utilise these additional security measures is a potential flaw that makes Origin Smart more of a target than it needs to be. Collection At the most basic level, Origin Smart is collecting critical information about customers putting it all into internet-connected systems and making it available to customers from any internet-connected computer around the world. Why would a Victorian Origin Energy customer need to see their half-hourly energy usage while on holiday in Russia? More concerning is the fact the Origin Smart: Initial Privacy Consent provides a list of organisations that customers agree, when signing up to the service, to allow access to their data. That list includes: … relevant contractors which may include installers, mail houses, data processing analysts, IT service providers and smart energy technology providers, debt collection agencies and credit reporting agencies, relevant Government authorities … Why would I want to share my half-hourly electricity usage data with a debt collector? Or a credit reporting agency for that matter? Is Origin Smart being set up as a dual-purpose portal that will allow a range of companies to log in and access the complete energy usage history of one or more customers? No-one as yet is saying so, but it would be reassuring to have such issues clarified. Offshoring data The Origin Smart Terms and Conditions indicate customer information will be sent to a “third-party smart energy technology provider” located in Colorado, USA. The Australian government should be very concerned that potentially most (Origin Energy currently has 4. 4 m customers nationwide) of Australia’s residential, business and corporate energy usage is being sent to the USA – a country that does not have strict privacy and security rules. The Origin Smart Terms and Conditions read: The USA does not have laws that provide the same level of protection for an individual’s personal information as in Australia, however, the Third Party Provider is required to comply with any applicable privacy legislation. But let’s be clear: the US company is not subject to Australian law and would never agree to being subject to Australian privacy laws. This statement in the Origin Energy Terms and Conditions should be investigated by the relevant authorities immediately. Data breach? Are we in danger of inadvertently paving the way for the largest personal data breach in Australian history? And all without having been attacked by Anonymous, by cyber-terrorists or a potential enemy nation carrying out an act of cyber-warfare. Origin Energy has stated it will send customer data to a company in a country that does not require that company to keep the data secure and permits the company to on-sell the data to whomever they please. I’m gobsmacked. Can Origin Energy guarantee the data sent to the USA will be destroyed at some point in the future? When would this be? We all should remember Google making a similar promise to the Australian Privacy Commissioner in the context of the Google Street View controversy. Google admitted to collecting Wi-Fi data when capturing information for Google Steet View. After assuring the Australian Privacy Commissioner that all of the data collected had been destroyed, Google later admitted to finding more data that had not been destroyed. To summarise, my concerns about Origin Smart are the following: Poor security. Without two-step authentication the system could be a juicy hacking target Poor privacy. The list of organisations that can be provided with access to customer data is extraordinary and access for many is unnecessary and unwarranted National security. The data of everyone who signs up to Origin Smart will be sent to the USA. The Origin Smart Initial Privacy Consent requirement and the Terms and Conditions were red flags for me. As an Origin Energy customer I chose not sign up to Origin Smart. I strongly recommend you refrain from doing so as well. Mark Gregory is an Origin Energy customer.
