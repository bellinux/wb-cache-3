40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the hydraulic performance of a full-scale on-site vertical-flow biofilter, consisting of a mixture of peat and carbon-containing ash, and a 500 m(3) equalization pond prior to the filter-system. The treatment plant was constructed to clean up leachate from an industrial <b>mono-landfill</b> that contained shredder residues of end-of-life vehicles and white goods. With the limited storage capacity of the equalization pond, peak loading rates exceeded up to five to six times the designed daily hydraulic load limit of the biofilter system. Such relatively short overloading events did not negatively affect the purification efficiency. To provide the designed annual irrigation rate on the biofilter of 97 m(3) day(- 1) (or 133 mm day(- 1)), with large seasonal variations in precipitation, a relatively large pond would be needed. Calculations showed that a storage volume of about 23 000 m(3) would be sufficient for annual leachate volumes up to about 35 000 m(3). A combination of sprinkler and drip irrigation with straw insulation of the latter made it possible to run the plant continuously even when the ambient air temperature was below zero for more than a month at a time. The grain size distribution of the biofilter medium was noticeably changed after 4 years of usage due to the loading of suspended solids from the leachate and decomposition of the peat, causing reduced hydraulic conductivity...|$|E
40|$|Invited lecture {{given by}} Peter Tom JonesUnlike China, Russia or South-Africa, Europe is not gifted with large, easily accessible, rich ore {{deposits}} containing valuable metals. However, Europe does have {{large quantities of}} secondary industrial residues. These residues constitute both flows of freshly produced and stocks of discarded materials. The latter category refers to the residues which have been deposited in so-called <b>mono-landfills</b> (incl. tailing ponds) throughout Europe, {{during the course of}} the last 100 - 150 years. Although the classical definition of Enhanced Landfill Mining (ELFM) – “the integrated valorisation of landfilled waste streams as materials and energy, using innovative transformation and upcycling technologies, and respecting the most stringent social and ecological criteria” – was mainly developed for landfills rich in Urban Solid Waste, it can also be adapted to the mining of these <b>mono-landfills.</b> Hence, Enhanced Landfill Mining of critical-metal-containing industrial <b>mono-landfills</b> implies the zero-waste valorisation of these materials, resulting in the recovery of the critical (and base) metals and the valorisation of the residual mineral matrices. In terms of accessibility, volumes and metal concentrations, some of the most interesting industrial process residues are considered to be: (1) bauxite residue; (2) phosphogypsum; (3) iron-rich sludges; (4) metallurgical slags; and (5) bottom ashes and fly ashes. This review gives an overview of the potential of these residues for recovery of critical elements and the state-of-the-art of the recovery technologies. In the concluding section the importance of the zero-waste valorisation concept is highlighted. status: publishe...|$|R
