With regards to the nature of paddy hulling operation in the milling process some of the rice quality losses occur at this stage because the hulling operation is mechanical and consist of different stresses. Three varieties of Binam, Khazer and Alikazemi were used for the study. The levels of moisture content used in the tests were 9. 5 - 11, 11 - 12. 5 and 12. 5 - 14 % wet. The linear speed difference was chosen so that the linear speed of rollers was in the range of 200 to 275 <b>m</b> <b>min</b> - 1. The results showed that the main effects of all parameters studied were significant on the amount of rice breakage. The main effects such as linear speed differences of rollers <b>m</b> <b>min</b> - 1 and variety were significant on the hulling index and the counter effects of linear speed differences of rollers and m. c. were also significant on the hulling index but did not have a significant effect on the amount of rice breakage. The highest hulling index for the three varieties considered occurred with a roller linear speed difference of 236. 7 <b>m</b> <b>min</b> - 1 and the least rice breakage occurred when the roller linear speed difference were 229. 3 <b>m</b> <b>min</b> - 1.

There were statistically significant for the variables percentage of seeds germinated and seedling length, but for the variable seedling dry weight, T 3 treatment was presented a value statistically high to T 1, T 4, T 5 and T 6, but did not differ from T 2 and T 7 treatments.

40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to present {{experimentally}} the effect of poor thermal conductivity of thermoplastic on machining accuracy. In this case the machined surface roughness, maximum temperature generated during cutting and the dimensional accuracy of the drilled specimens were determined.

The use of large drill diameter leads to insignificantly increase the cutting temperature.

40|$|Background: Bread can {{contribute}} to the regulation of appetite. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the appetite ratings and postprandial glucose, insulin, and gastrointestinal hormone responses related to hunger and satiety after the intake of a cereal-based bread. Methods: A randomized, controlled crossover trial was conducted in 30 healthy adults (17 men and 13 women) aged 19 – 32 y with body mass index of 19. 2 – 28. 5. Each volunteer consumed the cereal-based bread and the control bread 2 times, with a 1 -wk wash-out period, over a total of 4 sessions. The cereal-based bread contained a variety of cereal flours (wheat, oat, and spelt) and consisted of 22 % dried fruits (figs, apricots, raisins, and prunes). It was also enriched with both fiber (7 % from wheat cross-linked maltodextrins and pea) and protein (10 – 11 % from wheat gluten and hydrolyzed wheat proteins). The control bread consisted of white bread with margarine and jam to control for energy density, fat, and sugar content. Wemeasured appetite ratings using standardized visual analogue scales and glucose, insulin, and gastrointestinal hormone responses over a postprandial time of 4 h after the ingestion of each bread. Linear mixed-effects models were used to compare the areas under the curve (AUCs) for different variables. Results: Consuming the cereal-based bread decreased prospective consumption more than consumption of the control bread (25. 36 0. 6 <b>m</b> <b>min</b> and 24. 46 0. 6 <b>m</b> <b>min,</b> respectively; P = 0. 02) and increased satiety more (6. 26 0. 7 <b>m</b> <b>min</b> and 5. 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{machining}} parameters affect {{surface quality}} and usually, wood planing process is {{heavily influenced by}} external parameters. External parameters concern mainly the machining process parameters such as: the feeding speed, the depth of cut, the cutting tool diameter and geometry, the cutting geometry, the cutting technique (up or down milling). This study was carried out to determine the planing properties of naturally grown Melunak (Pentace sp.), Dark Red Meranti (Shorea sp.) and Rubberwood (Hevea brasiliensis). Some machining defects such as fuzzy grain, torn grain and chip marks often occur in lumbers at the planing process and it decreases the machining yield. To understand and optimize the planing characteristics of this wood species, a series of experiments were carried out using a weinig Unimate 23 E moulder (cutter-head rpm of 6000, cutter diameter 120 mm) to produce machined surface with differing depth of cut ranging from 0. 8 to 2. 4 mm, by altering the feed rate from 8 to 16 <b>m</b> <b>min</b> - 1 according to ASTM D 1666 - 87. Based on the preliminary results of this study, the best results were obtained at 0. 8 mm of depth of cut and feed rate of 8 <b>m</b> <b>min</b> - 1 for Dark Red Meranti. While, the poorest results was on Melunak wood at 2. 4 mm of depth of cut and 16 <b>m</b> <b>min</b> - 1 of feed speed.
