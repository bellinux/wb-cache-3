One of the proposed test sites is located near Sana’a, Yemen, where additionally to the PRISM stereo data also an IKONOS stereo image pair exists, which is used for DEM comparison and performance analysis. The results of this test site are evaluated in cooperation with the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR), Hannover. The paper gives a report on the generation of digital surface models (DSM) and orthoimages from ALOS/PRISM 3 -line stereo data using DLR’s automated stereo processing chain. Ground control points (GCP) of sufficient accuracy are introduced to increase the geometric accuracy of the derived DSM and orthoimages, but as well as evaluations without using GCP shall demonstrate the pointing performance of the ALOS/PRISM system. After the images are prepared for the processing, a matching is performed between the three images in forward, nadir and backward direction using a hierarchical intensity based matching. Sub-pixel accuracy is achieved by a local least squares matching. Blunder reduction is done by thresholds and bi-directional matching. A densification of the tie points is achieved by a region growing algorithm based on local least squares matching. From the obtained tie points, object space coordinates are derived from two different methods to interpolate a regular grid to create a DSM. For the first method Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPC) are generated for the PRISM images. For the second method a rigorous approach is applied using the exterior and interior orientation parameters as input for the forward intersection. Both methods are compared and the applicability of RPC for PRISM is discussed. Finally the resulting DSM is compared to the DSM generated from the IKONOS stereo pair and evaluated regarding horizontal and vertical accuracy by 3 D shift determination between the individual DSM, as well as profile analysis at different terrain steepness. The possible potential of the derived results is demonstrated for an integrated water resource management in Amran (Yemen), where satellite data of sufficient resolution can provide important information of the changing agrarian areas and resultant water supply.

Combining high spatial resolution and quick turnaround times is essential to generate useful remote sensing products for vegetation monitoring applied to agriculture and the environment.

Early detection of invasive plants is crucial for effective weed management. In this study, high spatial resolution multispectral imagery was captured and utilized for detecting the invasive plant Arundo donax. This invasive plant was detected and delineated using imagery captured with a digital color infrared <b>imaging</b> <b>sensor</b> mounted on an unmanned aerial system (UAS) in August of 2011 and a light manned aircraft along the San Diego River in May 2009. The multispectral image data are characterized by 12 cm and 81 cm spatial resolutions respectively with spectral coverage in the visible (V) and near infrared (NIR) portions of the light spectrum. Classification techniques were tested to exploit different attributes of the very high spatial resolution imagery. Three classification approaches were evaluated including: (1) a per-pixel maximum likelihood approach using ERDAS Imagine software, (2) a neighborhood based or pseudo-object oriented approach using Feature Analyst software, and (3) a true object-based approach using Imagine Objective software. To test the reliability and accuracy of the three different classification routines, the accuracy assessment included a stratified random sampling design scheme utilizing a 16 m point-to-point distance rule. Results indicate A. donax detection varied substantially throughout both study sites, between image datasets, and {{across a range of}} image classification algorithms. A. donax exhibits a wide range of biophysical characteristics within the riparian environment which make it difficult to determine a single optimal detection routine. Results derived from the statistical accuracy assessment suggest that: (1) A. donax patches as small as 3. 5 m?? can be detected by off-the- shelf <b>multispectral</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>sensors</b> aboard low cost, flexible imaging systems based on unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and light-sport aircraft (LSA) platforms, (2) a maximum likelihood classifier can accurately detect expansive A. donax colonies using 81 cm multispectral imagery, (3) the spatial contextual classifier of Feature Analyst was more efficient at detecting small and mixed A. donax patches, (4) the object-based Imagine Objective classifier utilizing image segmentation consistently yielded less accurate detection results, (5) ultra-high spatial resolution imagery obtained by a UAS can achieve similar A. donax detection results compared to coarser spatial resolution imagery obtained by a manned LSA in small and sparse communities, and (6) detection accuracy of all classification routines decreases when A. donax distributions are sparse, relatively small and mixed within other riparian vegetation types.

Far more different from traditional color imaging analysis method, we introduced <b>multispectral</b> <b>imaging</b> techniques. After an image with high quality was acquired, the spectrum of each pixel was directly fed into a trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification, then morphological binary operations were performed to correct the small error-classified regions. Masses of experiments show that our <b>multispectral</b> <b>imaging</b> method is device-independent to a large extent, and the segmentation results are highly satisfactory and inspiring. It proves that the introduction of <b>multispectral</b> <b>imaging</b> analysis techniques into White Blood Cells detection is a success. <b>Multispectral</b> <b>imaging</b> analysis is a promising technique in biomedicine...|$|R
40|$|<b>Multispectral</b> <b>imaging</b> {{has been}} {{evaluated}} for {{characterization of the}} concentration of a specific cartenoid pigment; astaxanthin. 59 fillets of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, were filleted and imaged using a rapid <b>multispectral</b> <b>imaging</b> device for quantitative analysis. The <b>multispectral</b> <b>imaging</b> device captures reflection properties in 19 distinct wavelength bands, prior to determination of the true concentration of astaxanthin. The samples ranged from 0. 20 to 4. 34 g per g fish. A PLSR model was calibrated to predict astaxanthin concentration from novel images, and showed good results with a RMSEP of 0. 27. For comparison a similar model were built for normal color images, which yielded a RMSEP of 0. 45. The acquisition speed of the <b>multispectral</b> <b>imaging</b> system and {{the accuracy of the}} PLSR model obtained suggest this method as a promising technique for rapid in-line estimation of astaxanthin concentration in rainbow trout fillets...|$|R

40|$|The European Space Agency (ESA) is {{spending}} notable effort {{to put in}} operation {{a new generation of}} advanced Earth-observation satellites, the Sentinel constellation. In particular, the Sentinel- 2 host an instrumental payload mainly consisting in a <b>MultiSpectral</b> Instrument (MSI) <b>imaging</b> <b>sensor,</b> capable of acquiring high-resolution imagery of the Earth surface and atmospheric reflectance at selected spectral bands, hence providing complementary measurements to ground-based radiometric stations. The latter can provide reference data for validating the estimates from spaceborne instruments such as Sentinel- 2 A (operating since October 2015), whose aerosol optical thickness (AOT) values, can be obtained from correcting SWIR (2190 nm) reflectance with an improved dense dark vegetation (DDV) algorithm. In the Northwestern European Alps (Saint-Christophe, 45. 74 °N, 7. 36 °E) a Prede POM- 02 sun/sky aerosol photometer has been operating for several years within the EuroSkyRad network by the Environmental Protection Agency of Aosta Valley (ARPA Valle d'Aosta), gathering direct sun and diffuse sky radiance for retrieving columnar aerosol optical properties. This aerosol optical depth (AOD) dataset represents an optimal ground-truth for the corresponding Sentinel- 2 estimates obtained with the Sen 2 cor processor in the challenging environment of the Alps (complex topography, snow-covered surfaces). We show the deviations between the two measurement series and propose some corrections to enhance the overall accuracy of satellite estimates...|$|R
