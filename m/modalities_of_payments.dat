With the fast grow of distance learning technologies it is important to think about some innovations in the pedagogic strategies to improve education. The students have different learning styles and the tutor needs to support those needs, to ensure the quality of learning and keep them motivated.

Registry data of 1 year was used to calculate length of stay and analyze the variations. &# 13; Results: Average length of stay was 10. 5 days. It was 10. 7 days for males and 10. 1 days for females. It was 10. 12 days for patients paying themselves for their treatment whereas 14. 98 days for patients receiving reimbursement (third party payment). &# 13; Conclusions: Average length of stay was more in elderly and patients of trauma (longest in pelvis injury).

This article proposes an economic approach for explaining the evolution of losses caused by big game. The most part of previous analysis related to loss caused by big game consisted in developing a-economic approaches. Our analysis explains the increase of damages by the cost of hunting, the decrease of hunting activities, the absence of market for rights of hunting, a rule of liability which reduces the farmers’ incentives to limit them, and by the <b>modalities</b> <b>of</b> damages <b>payment</b> which favour the free riding behaviour among the hunters...|$|R

40|$|National audienceThis article {{deals with}} the {{development}} of Cardinal Protectors of Nations in the 15 th century. It is based partly on texts examined by Josef Wodka (1938), partly on the correspondence of Cardinal Enea Silvio Piccolomini published in the Opera Omnia edition of 1571 and the correpondence of King Christian 1. with the Papal Court. The author's interpretation of the development differs somewhat from Josef Wodka's in that it recognizes the decisive role of the Council of Basle in creating a legal base for cardinals representing royal interests at the Apostolic See. The Council agreed with the stance of Pope Martin V that cardinals should act as impartial and independent advisors of popes, but - reaching back to Avignonese precedents - it accepted a form of representation termed "promotorship" rather than "protectorship" of royal affairs. It did not indicate any difference of content between the two concepts, but only addressed the <b>modalities</b> <b>of</b> partiality and <b>payment.</b> This interpretation is based on the Conciliar Decree itself and on the Cardinal's correspondence which documents the practice at the Papal Court in the 1450 's, including a formal arrangement of promotorship between the Cardinal and the Emperor, and negotiations concerning such a promotorship between the Cardinal and the King of Denmark...|$|R

The investigation was conducted through cointegrated vector autoregression methods. The investigation reveals that fiscal balance, GDP and interest rate are the main determinants <b>of</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> in Namibia. Increase in GDP and interest rate causes an improvement in the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> The positive effect of GDP on balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> suggests that expansion of export has {{a positive impact on}} current account and the overall balance <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> More increased export potential through the development of new products and services should be encouraged.

In this sense, the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> is one <b>of</b> the major indicators of a country's status in international trade. As its strength and sustainability significantly affect the economic policies of a government and global competitiveness, every country strives to a have a favorable balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> and maintains its long run sustainability. India’s balance <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> position was quite unfavorable during the time of country’s entry into liberalized trade regime. Two decade of economic reforms and free trade opened several opportunities that reflected in the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> performance <b>of</b> the country. This paper attempts to evaluate the trends of India’s Balance <b>of</b> <b>Payments</b> and identify its emerging challenges. The discussion is broadly classified into four parts viz. i) India’s balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> picture since 1991, ii) emerging role of invisibles and software services in balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> iii) unhealthy trends in FDI and iv) the vulnerability and challenges ahead. ...|$|R

Our empirical finding shows that political stability is more important than economic freedom in stabilizing balance <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> Stable political regime with visionary leadership leads the nations to higher level of favorable balance <b>of</b> <b>payment.</b> Political stability is playing major role than theoretical explanation to achieve surplus <b>of</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> hence exchange rare stability.
