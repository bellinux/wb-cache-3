5|$|Amino acids {{are usually}} {{classified}} by {{the properties of}} their side chain into four groups. The side chain can make an amino acid a weak acid or a weak base, and a hydrophile if the side chain is polar or a hydrophobe if it is nonpolar.

5|$|By the 1850s {{the term}} {{crinoline}} was more usually {{applied to the}} fashionable silhouette provided by horsehair petticoats, and to the hoop skirts that replaced them in the mid-1850s. In form and function these hoop skirts were similar to the 16th- and 17th-century farthingale and to 18th-century panniers, in that they too enabled skirts to spread even wider and <b>more</b> <b>fully.</b>|$|E

5|$|In J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, Elves {{are one of}} {{the races}} that inhabit a fictional Earth, often called Middle-earth, and set in the remote past.

50|$|Integral windup {{particularly}} {{occurs as}} {{a limitation of}} physical systems, compared with ideal systems, due to the ideal output being physically impossible (process saturation: {{the output of the}} process being limited at the top or bottom of its scale, making the error constant). For example, the position of a valve cannot be any <b>more</b> open than <b>fully</b> open and also cannot be closed any <b>more</b> than <b>fully</b> closed. In this case anti-windup can actually involve the integrator being turned off for periods of time until the response falls back into an acceptable range.|$|R

5|$|A Warrior Who Fought Custer was {{published}} in April 1931 to mostly good reviews. However, W. J. Ghent, writing in the New York Times, criticized the claim made by Wooden Leg that many of Custer's men had committed suicide rather than face death {{at the hands of}} the Indians. Although sales of the Wooden Leg book did well, better than Marquis had expected, this controversy was to prove a hindrance to his chances of future book publications. Marquis believed he had multiple Indian sources verifying this account, and there were no surviving whites to contradict it. He planned to develop the idea <b>more</b> <b>fully</b> in a future book, eventually to become Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself.|$|E
5|$|A {{version of}} the tale was {{composed}} by Potter in 1903, but set aside to develop other projects. In 1904, she failed to complete a book of nursery rhymes for Warnes, and the 1903 tale was accepted in its stead. Potter elaborated its setting and storyline, and developed the tale <b>more</b> <b>fully</b> before publication. The illustrations depict the cottages and gardens of Sawrey, a village in the Lake District near Potter's Hill Top farm, and {{have been described as}} some of the most exquisite Potter ever produced. Ribby was modelled on a cat living in Sawrey, Duchess on two Pomeranians belonging to Potter's neighbour Mrs Rogerson, Tabitha Twitchit on Potter's cat at Hill Top, and Dr Maggoty on the magpies in the London Zoological Gardens.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{convection}} {{acquired a}} closed circulation and became Tropical Depression One-C on August 22. It stayed disorganized {{for the next}} several days. It organized <b>more</b> <b>fully</b> and intensified into a tropical storm on August 25 and was named Alika. After peaking as a moderately strong tropical storm on August 25, wind shear caused by the pre-Ele tropical depression and an upper-level low near Hawaii weakened the storm to a depression on August 27. Alika dissipated the next day, having never threatened land.|$|E

5|$|By the 1940s, {{production}} in the East Texas Oil Field and oil prices stabilized. Though the major urban areas continued to grow, the extreme growth patterns {{of the first three}} decades began to slow. As western Texas and the panhandle region began to be <b>more</b> <b>fully</b> explored, the Permian Basin gradually became the top producing area of the state. Though independent oil companies were still {{an important part of the}} industry for some time, the major new strikes were increasingly made by established companies. World War II helped complete the state's transition to an industrialized and urbanized state with oil facilitating the transition.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates the Enhydra lineage became {{isolated in the}} North Pacific approximately 2 Mya, giving rise to the now-extinct Enhydra macrodonta and the modern sea otter, Enhydra lutris. The sea otter evolved initially in northern Hokkaidō and Russia, and then spread east to the Aleutian Islands, mainland Alaska, and down the North American coast. In comparison to cetaceans, sirenians, and pinnipeds, which entered the water approximately 50, 40, and 20 Mya, respectively, the sea otter is a relative newcomer to a marine existence. In some respects, though, the sea otter is <b>more</b> <b>fully</b> adapted to water than pinnipeds, which must haul out on land or ice to give birth.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 Vaughan Williams {{was elected}} {{president}} of the English Folk Dance and Song Society. From September to December of that year he was in the US as a visiting lecturer at Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania.

It is never explained how he received or could afford his membership of the club, which had a restricted membership of only 200 gentlemen, all of whom had to show £100,000 in cash or gilt-edged securities. Amis, in his study The James Bond Dossier, considers that on M's salary his membership of the club would have been puzzling; Amis points out that in the 1963 book On Her Majesty's Secret Service it is revealed that M's pay as head of the Secret Service is £6,500 a year.|$|E
5|$|Shiren the Wanderer was {{developed}} by Chunsoft for the Super Famicom, with the core concept of repeated play, with the player improving their equipment and items each time they play, making progress through several playthroughs. The developers noted that Shiren the Wanderer differed from other Mystery Dungeon titles in that the Chunsoft staff create characters themselves, allowing them to express the Mystery Dungeon series <b>more</b> <b>fully</b> than with the other titles, which are set in already created worlds which Chunsoft cannot change. The game {{was developed}} in parallel with the Game Boy game Shiren the Wanderer GB, which used modified source code from the Super Famicom game.|$|E
5|$|Taking a {{negative}} real number b to a rational power u/v, where u/v is in lowest terms, yields a positive real result if u is even, and hence v is odd, because then b'u is positive; and yields {{a negative}} real result, if u and v are both odd, because then b'u is negative. The case of odd u and even v cannot be treated this way within the reals, {{since there is}} no real number x such that , the value of b'u/v in this case must use the imaginary unit i, as described <b>more</b> <b>fully</b> in the section § Powers of complex numbers.|$|E
50|$|Faux stone {{painting}} was {{widely used in}} Pompeii, but it really took off in Europe during the Renaissance with two schools of faux painting developing.
