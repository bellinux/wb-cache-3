5|$|A <b>mirror</b> <b>on</b> {{the back}} wall {{reflects}} the upper bodies and heads of two figures identified from other paintings, and by Palomino, as King PhilipIV(10) and Queen Mariana(11). The most common assumption is that the reflection shows the couple in the pose they are holding for Velázquez as he paints them, while their daughter watches; and that the painting therefore shows {{their view of the}} scene.|$|E
5|$|Altar N {{is another}} small {{rhyolite}} sculpture stylistically similar to Altar M. This sculpture has {{the form of}} a turtle shell with a skeletal head with a <b>mirror</b> <b>on</b> its forehead emerging sideways from one end and an elderly figure from the other. This is a representation of the bicephalic deity Pawatun (GodN), a prominent underworld deity.|$|E
5|$|The font design {{featured}} on the front cover was created by Pizz, a graphic artist from Long Beach, who also designed album cover art for several other indie rock bands. The {{back side of the}} album features a painting by bassist Emery, depicting a topless woman looking at herself through a hand <b>mirror.</b> <b>On</b> her chest is a red heart surrounded by arrows, and below, her ribs protrude from her sides, possibly a reference to anorexia and body image issues, a major theme of the album and its successor Live Through This.|$|E

5|$|The single reel drama was {{directed}} by Lucius J. Henderson. Henderson was an important director at the Thanhouser Company who began directing in the late autumn of 1910. It is unknown how many film's Henderson directed prior {{to the release of}} Adrift, but one prior credit When Love Was Blind was released two weeks prior, on January 24, 1911. The New York Dramatic <b>Mirror</b> <b>on</b> February 4, 1914, stated that Henderson had directed about 150 one and two reel dramas for the Thanhouser Company.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{existing}} landscaping {{on the south lawn}} was carried out by Bishop George Henry Law in the 1820s. This included the incorporation of the remains of the roofless great hall and the construction of a raised rampart around the inside of the wall accessible from one of the towers. Bishop Law also created a grotto which he used to display fossils from Banwell Caves which were also part of his estate. A range of tress and shrubs were planted including: a black walnut, Lebanon cedar, catalpa and ginkgo. In the 1830s, Bishop Law had a pool created next to the springs. This acts as a <b>mirror</b> <b>on</b> a still day providing reflections of the east end of the cathedral in the water.|$|E
5|$|Raghip's {{parents had}} moved from Cyprus to England in 1956. Raghip left school at age 15, illiterate, {{and by the time}} of the murder had two convictions, one for {{stealing}} cars and one for burglary. He had a common-law wife, Sharon Daly, with whom he had a two-year-old boy, and he worked occasionally as a mechanic. He had little connection with Broadwater Farm, though he lived in nearby Wood Green and had gone to the Farm with two friends to watch the riot, he said. One of those friends, John Broomfield, gave an interview to the Daily <b>Mirror</b> <b>on</b> 23 October, boasting about his involvement. When Broomfield was arrested, he implicated Raghip. Broomfield was later convicted of an unrelated murder.|$|E

5|$|The Arnolfini {{is named}} after Jan van Eyck's {{masterpiece}} The Arnolfini Portrait (1434) depicting the merchant and arts patron Giovanni Arnolfini. The Arnolfini Portrait {{is one of the}} earliest paintings to assert the presence of the artist within its depiction (an inscription {{in the middle of the}} work and a reflection in a <b>mirror</b> <b>on</b> the back wall) and one of Arnolfini's consistent concerns: to explore the role of artist as a witness and recorder of what is around them – contemporary society. The painting is in the National Gallery, London and it was one of the founder's favourite paintings.|$|E
5|$|The {{four of them}} {{travel to}} Murdaw's castle, in the {{original}} world. After defeating Murdaw, the Hero uses the <b>Mirror</b> <b>on</b> him. Murdaw then turns into the King of Somnia, confused and unaware of what happened. The king reveals that the original world {{is in fact the}} Dream World and the Phantom World is the Real World. Upon traveling back to the Real World, the King of Somnia thanks the party for defeating Murdaw in his dreams, but that the real Murdaw lives and that the party must travel to Ghent to retrieve a boat to get to Murdaw's lair. In Ghent, Nevan, a healer, joins the party and allows them to use the Ghent Clan's ship. During the fight with the real Murdaw, the Hero gets is again sent back to Weaver's Peak. However, with the Mirror of Ra, the Hero warps back into the battle and defeats Murdaw.|$|E
5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1000 feet in length, {{was released}} on June 14, 1910. Theater advertisements for the film were found in newspapers in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio. The film was alternatively known and advertised as Taming a Woman Hater. One theater in Pennsylvania would advertise Thanhouser's Jane Eyre as a magnificent and costly production and follow it up with The Woman Hater with the generic advertisement promotion {{that it was a}} great film. It is unknown if published trade reviews for this work exist, but there is an absence of a citation Bowers. Given this absence, it is possible that additional details or commentary can be obtained from advertisements or local newspapers outside of typical trade publications. The film was labeled a comedy in an advertisement, using the name Taming a Woman Hater in The New York Dramatic <b>Mirror</b> <b>on</b> June 18, 1910.|$|E

The camera was placed inside a specially constructed box and lowered underwater, but the result disappointed Wilder, who insisted on further experiments. The shot was finally achieved by placing a <b>mirror</b> <b>on</b> the bottom of the pool and filming Holden's reflection from above with the distorted image of the policemen standing around the pool and forming a backdrop.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} decades {{saw more}} elaborate attempts to interpret eye movement, including {{a claim that}} meaningful text requires fewer fixations to read than random strings of letters. In 1879, the French ophthalmologist Louis Émile Javal used a <b>mirror</b> <b>on</b> {{one side of a}} page to observe eye movement in silent reading, and found that it involves a succession of discontinuous individual movements for which he coined the term saccades. In 1898, Erdmann & Dodge used a hand-mirror to estimate average fixation duration and saccade length with surprising accuracy.|$|E
