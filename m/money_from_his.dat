5|$|After his death, {{criminal}} charges were threatened against Robinson in Cleveland, {{up to and}} including murder, though none actually materialized. After learning of Doyle's intentions of using the bout's money to buy his mother a house, Robinson gave Doyle's mother the <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> next four bouts so she could purchase herself a home, fulfilling her son's intention.|$|E
5|$|Balzac {{borrowed}} <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> {{family and}} friends, {{and tried to}} build a printing business, then a typefounder enterprise. His inexperience and lack of capital caused his ruin in these trades. He gave the businesses to a friend (who made them successful) but carried the debts for many years. As of April 1828 Balzac owed 50,000 francs to his mother.|$|E
5|$|Matusow {{was first}} {{introduced}} to poker when he played video poker at the Maxim Casino {{at the age of}} 18. He was a regular and played so much that he suffered from repetitive strain injury in his shoulders and arms. He occasionally stole <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> mother's purse and at one point attended Gamblers Anonymous meetings. Matusow was taught Texas hold 'em in 1989 by a rounder named Steve Samaroff.|$|E

"That {{she should}} never trouble him--but never, never: neither appeal nor {{complain}} nor write about anything; only meet all questions herself, receive all <b>moneys</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> solicitor, {{take the whole}} thing over and let him alone. She promised to do this, and she mentioned to me that when, for a moment, disburdened, delighted, he held her hand, thanking her for the sacrifice, she already felt rewarded." ...|$|R
50|$|The journey {{took place}} during a {{difficult}} period of Mozart's career when {{he was no longer}} earning much <b>money</b> <b>from</b> concerts, and <b>his</b> income <b>from</b> the composition of operas had not made up the difference. He was borrowing <b>money,</b> for example <b>from</b> <b>his</b> friend Michael Puchberg, and the financial situation was very worrisome.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come on, you stingy cowpunchers," [...] {{he called}} out, {{snatching}} the <b>money</b> <b>from</b> Wade. <b>His</b> action then, violent and vivid as it was, {{did not reveal}} any more than his face.|$|R
5|$|Standard owes {{protection}} <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> time {{in prison}} and is beaten up by Albanian gangster Cook, who demands that Standard rob a pawnshop for $40,000 {{to pay off the}} debt. Cook gives Benicio a bullet as a symbol that he and his mother are in danger. The Driver, concerned for the safety of Irene and Benicio, offers to act as the getaway driver for the pawnshop robbery.|$|E
5|$|A {{longtime}} {{fan of the}} English trip hop group Portishead, West {{had been}} significantly influenced by Roseland NYC Live, the band's 1998 live album with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip hop production. Though West {{had not been able}} to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album. West juxtaposed the lush, intricate melodies of the string section with the hard, pounding drum rhythms of hip-hop, and used the sound for the foundation of his rapping.|$|E
5|$|Don instructs the Jaguar team {{to ditch}} the {{mistress}} concept {{because it is}} vulgar. Later, Harry praises Peggy's work on Chevalier Blanc. She tells Don the client ultimately went with the same ad as before, only in a Paris setting. Don says Ginsberg will take over once the Jaguar pitch is finished, prompting Peggy to reply {{that she is not}} in charge of everything. Don pulls some <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> wallet and condescendingly tosses it in Peggy's face, telling her that if she wants to go to Paris, she should just go. Ken tries to comfort her, saying that Don is just upset about Jaguar, to which she replies that she does not care.|$|E

5|$|Hugh Hare (1606–1667) had {{inherited}} {{a large amount}} of <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> great-uncle Sir Nicholas Hare, Master of the Rolls. On the death of his father, his mother had remarried Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, allowing the young Hugh Hare to rise rapidly in Court and social circles. He married Montagu's daughter by his first marriage and purchased the manor of Tottenham, including the Lordship House, in 1625, and was ennobled as Baron Coleraine shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Rastignac, {{who moved}} to Paris from the south of France, becomes {{attracted}} to the upper class. He has difficulty fitting in, but is tutored by his cousin, Madame de Beauséant, {{in the ways of}} high society. Rastignac endears himself to one of Goriot's daughters, Delphine, after extracting <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> own already-poor family. Vautrin, meanwhile, tries to convince Rastignac to pursue an unmarried woman named Victorine, whose family fortune is blocked only by her brother. He offers to clear the way for Rastignac by having the brother killed in a duel.|$|E
5|$|Some {{participants}} {{tried to}} track Russian down {{to have their}} questions answered. One contestant, Louise Miles, discovered that Russian's production company, NRP, did not actually exist and that {{the woman who had}} been answering their phone calls was really Russian's mother, Margaret. Another participant, Daniel Pope, managed to track Russian down to an address in Richmond upon Thames and convinced him to be interviewed by Christmas TV and apologise on camera. As Russian had not actually taken <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> victims, he had not committed a crime, and a civil case was not pursued {{due to a lack of}} funds.|$|E

5|$|A Welsh shipbroker, W. J. Orders, {{organised}} {{a collection}} fund {{on the floor}} of the Cardiff Coal Exchange and floated a public testimonial of one shilling. The national response was considerable and within weeks the total was into hundreds of pounds. This drew the Welsh Football Union (WFU) into a confrontation with the IRFB, as rule 2 on professionalism stated that no player was allowed to receive <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> club, or any member of his club, for services rendered to football. The fund could have been seen as a professional fee to Gould, henceforth making him ineligible to play for his country. The WFU argued that the money raised was not given by the club, but rather an outpouring of thanks from the Welsh public to a national hero.|$|E
5|$|Gasketball was {{developed}} and produced by Mikengreg, an Iowa-based two-man team: Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. After releasing their first game, the sport-inspired Solipskier for iPhone and iPad, Boxleiter and Wohlwend lived off the profits for two years while working on Gasketball, paying themselves their same salaries from their Adobe Flash development days but having the security to try new ideas. Wohlwend made somewhat more income due to other collaborations, such as Puzzlejuice with Asher Vollmer, but shared his income with Boxleiter. Development began in mid 2011. Even though Solipskier was successful, the duo {{did not have a}} following comparable to indie developers like Team Meat and thus did not feel pressured to meet high expectations. Instead, their pressure was internal. Wohlwend said he worked 100-hour weeks with no weekends or vacations while living on the Solipskier funds. When they ran out of money, Boxleiter borrowed <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> parents, and eventually they both went homeless, living on the couches of friends.|$|E
5|$|In 1830 Honoré de Balzac {{had only}} begun to achieve {{recognition}} as a writer. Although his parents had persuaded him to make his profession the law, he announced in 1819 {{that he wanted to}} become an author. His mother was distraught, but she and his father agreed to give him a small income, on the condition that he dedicate himself to writing, and deliver to them half of his gross income from any published work. After moving into a tiny room near the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in Paris, Balzac wrote for one year, without success. Frustrated, he moved back to his family in the suburb of Villeparisis and borrowed <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> parents to pursue his literary ambitions further. He spent the next several years writing simple potboiler novels, which he published under a variety of pseudonyms. He shared some of his income from these with his parents, but by 1828 he still owed them 50,000 francs.|$|E
50|$|He enlists his mistress, Peaches (Hall), and her brother, Herb (Murphy), {{to stage}} a mock kidnapping. They are to make and receive a huge ransom demand, which would keep the <b>money</b> safe <b>from</b> <b>his</b> wife.|$|R

50|$|In 1825, Luigi Bormioli left Altare (Province of Savona) {{and moved}} to Borgo San Donnino (renamed Fidenza in 1927) in the {{province}} of Parma. With the <b>money</b> inherited <b>from</b> <b>his</b> father, Luigi started a glassware company.|$|R
5|$|In {{these early}} years, Harrison also earned <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> {{contributions}} to a biography written by James Hall, entitled A Memoir of the Public Services of William Henry Harrison, published in 1836. That year, {{he made an}} unsuccessful {{run for the presidency}} as a Whig candidate. Between 1836 and 1840, Harrison served as Clerk of Courts for Hamilton County. This was his job when he was elected president in 1840. About this time, Harrison met African-American abolitionist and Underground Railroad conductor George DeBaptiste who lived in nearby Madison. The two became friends, and DeBaptiste became his personal servant, staying with Harrison until his death. By 1840, when Harrison campaigned for president a second time, over a dozen books had been published on his life. He was hailed by many as a national hero.|$|E
5|$|Pat Secor, Hoppus' boss at {{music store}} The Wherehouse, was {{attempting}} {{to start his own}} record label, named Filter Records. Secor pulled <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> savings and helped finance and produce the demo recording. Buddha was recorded live at local Santee studio Doubletime, compiling a collection that represented nearly all of the songs the band had written up to that point. Hoppus and friends Cam Jones and Kerry Key created the cassette artwork, and the original cassette packaging was compiled by the band and Hoppus' family. Locally distributed to several San Diego record stores and available for purchase at early concerts, Buddha helped the trio cement an audience and was a deciding factor in their signing to local label Cargo in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenge}} was to make £1million in a single year. Realising that they would essentially be making their own prize money, most contestants quit the show within two days. One group stayed together for slightly longer: sleeping {{on the floor of}} their cameraman's flat, they attempted to create their own TV show about themselves. Having also given up his flat and job, Russian was also homeless, and was forced to stay with the contestants he had manipulated. After the programme failed, Russian went into hiding, and was unable to be contacted. He was eventually tracked down by one of his victims to an address in Richmond upon Thames, where he was forced to apologise on camera. As he had not taken any <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> victims, a criminal case against Russian was not pursued—a civil case was also not pursued {{due to a lack of}} funds.|$|E
50|$|Los Angeles-based {{entertainment}} {{manager and}} college student Daniel Thomas La Paille, 25, purchased the town on August 3, 2006 from Krall.

50|$|After {{contractual}} {{issues with}} Candid, Stilgoe bought {{himself out of}} the contract and used <b>money</b> earned <b>from</b> <b>his</b> concerts to record demos of new songs. Nick Stewart then signed Stilgoe under his management with Nick Stewart and Associates in 2010.|$|R
5|$|With {{the aid of}} a small sum of <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> distant {{relative}} the Chief Rabbi, Adler {{got together}} the money to travel by steerage to New York, with his infant son Abrom, Alexander Oberlander and his family, Keni and Volodya Liptzin, and Herman Fiedler, among others. Adler did not doubt that the rabbi was glad to see Yiddish actors leaving London. In New York, they promptly discovered that neither Mogulesko and Finkel at the Romanian Opera House nor Maurice Heine at the Oriental Theater had any use for them. They headed on to Chicago, where, after a brief initial success, the troupe fell apart due to a combination of labor disputes and cutthroat competition. The Oberlanders managed to start a restaurant; he and Keni Liptzin headed to New York that autumn, where she managed to sign on at the Romanian Opera House; failing to find a similar situation for himself, he returned to London, drawn back to the charms of both Dinah and Jennya.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York, Häyhänen {{spent the next}} two years establishing his identity. During that time he received <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> superiors left in dead-letter boxes in the Bronx and Manhattan. It is known he occasionally drew attention to himself by indulging in heavy drinking sessions and heated arguments with his Finnish wife Hannah. For six months Häyhänen checked the thumbtack and no one had made contact. He also checked a dead-drop location he had memorized. There he found a hollowed-out nickel. However, prior to opening the coin Häyhänen had misplaced it, either buying a newspaper with it or using it as a subway token. For the next seven months the hollow nickel travelled around the New York City economy, unopened. The trail of the hollow nickel ended when a thirteen-year-old newsboy was collecting for his weekly deliveries. The newsboy accidentally dropped the nickel and it broke in half, revealing a microphotograph containing a series of numbers. The newsboy handed the nickel to a New York detective, who in turn forwarded it to the FBI. From 1953 to 1957, though every effort was made to decipher the microphotograph, the FBI was unable to solve the mystery.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Red Letter Day, Dewees became a {{full-time}} member as the band began recording their second studio album in Los Angeles in June 1999 with producer Alex Brahl. Before the album went into production, Vagrant Records co-owner John Cohen borrowed <b>money</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> parents, who had mortgaged their house in order to fund {{the production of the}} album. On September 21, 1999, the band released Something to Write Home About on Vagrant Records. The album's lyrics reflected the record label strife the band had experienced and their distance between friends and family back home after their move to Los Angeles. Something to Write Home About has been singled out as the band's only 'true' emo album, as the album's aesthetic fit more into the contemporary definition of the genre. Furthermore, the album single-handedly turned the struggling Vagrant label into one of the top indie labels in the country, selling over 140,000 copies after its release. Not only did the album make The Get Up Kids the poster children for emo, but it also launched the genre into a public consciousness broader than the scattered local scenes that had previously embraced it. The album gave Vagrant Records the financial backing to grow and sign a string of other bands. At the same time, the addition of keyboards alienated some fans who thought it moved the band away from the contemporary punk scene's DIY ethic.|$|E
50|$|In {{the year}} 1990 Slow met JA-Jazz {{who was also}} a DJ and worked at the same {{department}} store's music department, where Slow worked. With <b>money</b> accrued <b>from</b> <b>his</b> evening job, Slow bought a pair of Technics turntables and good bunch of records.|$|R
