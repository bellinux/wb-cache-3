50|$|The older, {{traditional}} sensors have {{a magnet}} {{attached to a}} spoke of either the front or rear wheel. A sensor based either on the Hall effect, or on a <b>magnetic</b> <b>reed</b> <b>switch,</b> {{is attached to the}} fork or the rear of the frame. The sensor detects when the magnet passes once per rotation of the wheel. Alternatively, a sensor may be attached to the wheel hub. Distance is determined by counting the number of rotations, which translates into the number of wheel circumferences passed. Speed is calculated from distance against lapsed time period.|$|E
50|$|A problem exists {{with the}} {{hibernation}} sensor located in some older laptops. Unlike many laptops that use a mechanical switch to detect when the lid is closed, in these systems the sensor is a <b>magnetic</b> <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> that is located between the touchpad {{and the front}} edge of the laptop. There is a magnet that is located in the top lid above this switch, and when the lid is closed the magnet triggers the reed switch. If the magnet loses strength then the system will not go into suspend or hibernation if the lid is closed. The magnet strength can be checked by running a paper clip along the top edge of the screen. A worse problem happens if the reed switch fails. Sometimes the switches will fail in a closed position with the contacts sticking together. In that case the system will not switch on. There are several ways to check for this. First the laptop can be partially disassembled and the mouse assembly can be unplugged from the system board and the system switched on. If the system boots with the mouse unplugged then it is the switch. Another way to check for the problem is by running a magnet over the reed switch, there should be a faint click when the magnet triggers the switch. This does not require disassembly but the magnet must be in the correct position and be strong enough. Some people have modified the circuitry of the laptop by cutting the switch off of the assembly, with the downside being the system will no longer suspend if the lid is closed.|$|E

25|$|Temporary {{heat sinks}} are {{sometimes}} used while soldering circuit boards, preventing excessive heat from damaging sensitive nearby electronics. In the simplest case, this means partially gripping a component using a heavy metal crocodile clip, hemostat or similar clamp. Modern semiconductor devices, which {{are designed to}} be assembled by reflow soldering, can usually tolerate soldering temperatures without damage. On the other hand, electrical components such as <b>magnetic</b> <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> can malfunction if exposed to hotter soldering irons, so this practice is still very much in use.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{describe}} {{the design and}} implementation of a cup anemometer capable of logging average wind speed, maximum wind speed and seconds with wind above a criterion speed, on individual weeks. The instrument will operate for at least 54 weeks on two AA dry cells.

It is designed around a $ 2 micro-controller that provides non-volatile memory. Provision has been made for using either a <b>magnetic</b> <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> or the motor from a discarded hard disk drive to sense rotation. The latter enables the use of an otherwise worthless bearing and drive assembly to provide an especially frugal solution. I...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT-This paper {{deals with}} {{automatic}} meter reading and theft control system in energy meter. Current transformer is {{used to measure the}} total power consumption for house or industrial purpose. This recorded reading is transmitted to the electricity board for every 60 days once. For transmitting the reading of energy meter GSM module is used. To avoid theft, infrared sensor is placed in the screw portion of energy meter seal. If the screw is removed from the meter a message is sent to the electricity board. The measuring of energy meter and monitoring of IR sensor is done with a PIC microcontroller. The informative system will be helpful for the electricity board to monitor the entire supply and the correct billing accordingly without any mishap. This model reduces the manual manipulation work and theft control. Key word- IR Sensor, <b>Magnetic</b> <b>reed</b> <b>switch,</b> PIC 16 F 877 A Microcontroller. 1...|$|E
40|$|Security is {{the major}} part of home {{automation}} systems for the people. With the development of network and automatic control technology, a home security monitoring and alarming system {{becomes more and more}} practicable today. In this paper we have proposed simple, low cost, low power consumption and a novel method for implementing the home security using Zigbee (802. 15. 4) standard and also a security protocol for detecting and localizing identity based attacks in the system. We have named our scheme as Wireless Home Security System (WHSS) and protocol as Wireless Home Security Protocol (WHSP).

30|$|A {{number of}} smart {{lighting}} {{systems have been}} designed to adjust the lighting condition according to the occupancy in the space, and there are various options for the occupancy sensor, from imaging sensors to non-imaging sensors. For example, in 1987, Rea and Jaekel used video systems, infrared, ultrasonic, and electric eyes to assess energy efficiency in lighting a staff room (6.0 × 8.8 m) [7]. In 1992, an imaging lighting control system called ImCon was proposed, which used a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera to monitor the occupancy in a test room (5.6 × 5.6 m) and control four fluorescent fixtures [8]. In 2009, Delaney et al. proposed using a network of passive infrared (PIR) sensors and light sensors to evaluate energy efficiency in lighting systems [9]. In 2010, Agarwal et al. proposed a smart building automation solution using a combination of PIR sensors and <b>magnetic</b> <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> door sensors [10]. Recently, Aldrich et al. developed a lighting control application using networks of PIR sensors [11]. In 2010, Caicedo et al. looked into {{the problem of how to}} optimize the dimming levels of LED fixtures based on localized occupancy information [12]. A review paper by Guo et al. has comprehensively discussed different sensors that have been used in occupancy-based lighting control systems, including PIR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, audible sound sensors, microwave sensors, light barriers, video cameras, biometric systems, and pressure sensors [13]. Another review paper by Hassan et al. also discussed several occupancy detection techniques for lighting control applications, including PIR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, radio frequency identification (RFID), and cameras [14].|$|E
50|$|A later {{accessory}} was the 6043 Memory, {{which was}} used for switching predefined routes each with multiple turnouts & signals. The 6043 could save up to 24 different routes, which each route containing up to 20 individual device commands. The 20th command in one route memory {{could be used to}} link to another route button, so there could be a large number of individual commands enacted by pressing one button. In addition, the 6088 s88 Feedback Module could be used in conjunction with the 6043. The s88 would receive input signals from external buttons or <b>magnetic</b> <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> and then start a command string in the 6043 Memory. So, an approaching train could set up its own route, as an example. Another accessory was the 6050 computer Interface which let the system be computer controlled, allowing for fully automated train control.|$|R
50|$|<b>Reed</b> <b>switches</b> {{actuated}} by magnets {{are commonly}} used in mechanical systems as proximity sensors. Examples are door and window sensors in burglar alarm systems and tamperproofing methods (however they can be disabled by a strong, external <b>magnetic</b> field). <b>Reed</b> <b>switches</b> are used in modern laptops to put the laptop on sleep/hibernation mode when the lid is closed. Speed sensors on bicycle wheels and car gears use a <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> to actuate briefly each time a magnet on the wheel passes the sensor. <b>Reed</b> <b>switches</b> were formerly used in the keyboards for computer terminals, where each key had a magnet and a <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> actuated by depressing the key; cheaper switches are now used. Electric and electronic pedal keyboards used by pipe organ and Hammond organ players often use <b>reed</b> <b>switches,</b> where the glass enclosure of the contacts protects them from dirt, dust, and other particles. They may {{also be used to}} control diving equipment such as flashlights or camera, which must be sealed to keep pressurized water out.|$|R
40|$|This Master’s thesis {{deals with}} design and {{construction}} of a wireless security and surveillance system in ZigBee wireless networks (IEEE 802. 15. 4). The design consists of creating a star network topology with intended monitoring of home area via end device boards paired with coordinator board, which provides basic networking functionality. End device is used to send data from a temperature sensor DS 1631 and <b>magnetic</b> <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> to coordinator. ZigBee module ZDM-A 1281 -A 2 made by MeshNetics company embedded on each board contains a micro controller ATMega 1281 and a transceiver AT 86 RF 230 working in a 2, 4 GHz frequency band.

Open MAC consists of three application samples in C code. One of them was modified by the user for an application of communication between the module and sensors.

50|$|Switches can be {{designed}} to respond to any type of mechanical stimulus: for example, vibration (the trembler switch), tilt, air pressure, fluid level (a float switch), the turning of a key (key switch), linear or rotary movement (a limit switch or microswitch), or presence of a <b>magnetic</b> field (the <b>reed</b> <b>switch).</b> Many switches are operated automatically by changes in some environmental condition or by motion of machinery. A limit switch is used, for example, in machine tools to interlock operation with the proper position of tools. In heating or cooling systems a sail switch ensures that air flow is adequate in a duct. Pressure switches respond to fluid pressure.|$|R
50|$|<b>Reed</b> <b>switches</b> use a matched seal {{between an}} iron-nickel alloy (NiFe 52) and a matched glass. The glass of <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> is usually green {{due to its}} iron content because the sealing of <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> is done by heating with {{infrared}} radiation and this glass shows a high absorption in the near infrared.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> {{are filled}} with {{nitrogen}} at atmospheric pressure. After the final seal is made, the switch cools and the internal pressure is less than one atmosphere. <b>Reed</b> <b>switches</b> sealed with a pressurized nitrogen atmosphere have a higher breakdown voltage and are useful for switching 220-240 VAC power. <b>Reed</b> <b>switches</b> with a vacuum atmosphere can switch thousands of volts.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{contacts}} of the <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> are sealed {{away from the}} atmosphere, they are protected against atmospheric corrosion. The hermetic sealing of a <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> make them suitable for use in explosive atmospheres where tiny sparks from conventional switches would constitute a hazard.|$|R
50|$|A {{reed relay}} (sometimes {{also known as}} Herkon relay) {{is a type of}} relay that uses an {{electromagnet}} to control one or more <b>reed</b> <b>switches.</b> The contacts are of magnetic material and the electromagnet acts directly on them without requiring an armature to move them. Sealed in a long, narrow glass tube, the contacts are protected from corrosion, and are usually plated with silver, which has very low resistivity but is prone to corrosion when exposed, rather than corrosion-resistant but more resistive gold as used in the exposed contacts of high quality relays. The glass envelope may contain multiple <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> or multiple <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> can be inserted into a single bobbin and actuate simultaneously. <b>Reed</b> <b>switches</b> have been manufactured since the 1930s.|$|R

50|$|The {{hermetically}} sealed <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> {{is a very}} common type of two piece sensor that operates with an electrically conductive <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> that is either normally open or normally closed when {{under the influence of}} a magnetic field {{as in the case of}} proximity to the second piece which contains a magnet. When the magnet is moved away from the <b>reed</b> <b>switch,</b> the <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> either closes or opens, again based on whether or not the design is normally open or normally closed. This action coupled with an electric current (typically at 12V DC) allows an alarm control panel to detect a fault on that zone or circuit. These type of sensors are very common and are found either wired directly to an alarm control panel, or they can typically be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.|$|R
50|$|One {{important}} {{quality of}} the switch is its sensitivity, the amount of magnetic field necessary to actuate it. Sensitivity is measured in units of Ampere-turns (AT), corresponding to the current in a test coil multiplied {{by the number of}} turns in the test coil. Typical pull-in sensitivities for commercial devices are in the 10 to 60 AT range. The lower the AT, the more sensitive the <b>reed</b> <b>switch.</b> Also, smaller <b>reed</b> <b>switches,</b> which have smaller parts, are more sensitive to magnetic fields, so the smaller the <b>reed</b> <b>switch's</b> glass envelope is, the more sensitive it is.|$|R
50|$|<b>Reed</b> <b>switches</b> may be {{selected}} {{for a particular}} application when a solid-state Hall device is not suitable. <b>Reed</b> <b>switches</b> {{can be used to}} greatly reduce leakage current when compared with solid state devices; this may be useful, for example, in medical devices requiring protection of a patient from tiny leakage currents. The reed is hermetically sealed and can therefore operate in almost any environment, such as where flammable gas is present or where corrosion would affect open <b>switch</b> contacts. A <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> has very low resistance when closed, typically as low as 50 milliohms, whereas the Hall Effect can be in the hundreds of ohms.|$|R

5000|$|One type of {{float switch}} uses a mercury switch inside a hinged float. Another common type is a float that raises a rod to actuates a microswitch. One pattern uses a <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> mounted in a tube; a float, {{containing}} a magnet, surrounds {{the tube and}} is guided by it. When the float raises the magnet to the <b>reed</b> <b>switch,</b> it closes. Several reeds can be mounted in the tube for different level indications by one assembly.|$|R

5000|$|A {{magnetic}} field (from an electromagnet or a permanent magnet) {{will cause the}} reeds to attract each other, thus completing an electrical circuit. The spring force of the reeds causes them to separate, and open the circuit, when the {{magnetic field}} ceases. Another configuration contains a non-ferromagnetic normally-closed contact that opens when the ferromagnetic normally-open contact closes. A thin layer of non-ferromagnetic material {{is applied to the}} <b>reed</b> <b>switch</b> contact area to serve as an electrical contact switching (wear) surface and, for normally-open contacts, as a magnetic spacer whose thickness is important in controlling the magnetic field level at which the contact opens (the drop-out). <b>Reed</b> <b>switch</b> contacts are typically Rh, Ru, Ir, or W. There are also versions of <b>reed</b> <b>switches</b> with mercury [...] "wetted" [...] contacts. Such switches must be mounted in a particular orientation.
