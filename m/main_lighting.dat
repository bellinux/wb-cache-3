500|$|Bennett {{had started}} {{designing}} the lighting from November 2013 {{and three months}} later presented it to Gaga. She approved off the audience experience theme that Bennett developed. The B-Eyes, which were previously used in the Roseland shows, were mounted above the [...] video screens in the tour. Sharpy rigging were used throughout, {{in the front of}} the stage, rear, side, as well as on the pods over the audience. They were the <b>main</b> <b>lighting</b> accessory for the tour. Baeri explained that they had faced technical challenges, due to high pixel content. The B-Eyes added a total of 4,500 pixel and was varied through all possible configurations. The lighting effects varied along with the tone and the inflections of the song being performed. Clay Paky was distributed by A.C.T Lighting in North America. Solotech were signed as the video contractor, while 8th Day Sound group were the audio contractors throughout the tour.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{types of}} light can be mounted {{on to the}} outside of the vehicle (usually a {{permanent}} install) and these can be used to provide directional lighting in key areas, such as in front for clearing traffic, or to the rear for scene protection. [...] They can also form part of the <b>main</b> <b>lighting</b> arrangement for subtly marked or unmarked vehicles. [...] In this application, the operating service may choose to use lights with clear lenses so as to minimize the possibility of the lights being noticed when not on.|$|E
2500|$|From 1942 {{there was}} a {{shortage}} of rubber so handlebar grips and foot pegs were replaced by canvas covered metal items and production was standardised, with only minor modifications {{until the end of}} World War II. [...] By early 1942 a new large rear carrier was fitted to hold universal WD steel pannier-frames and bags. This meant repositioning the long prop stand to forward of the nearside rear wheel spindle nut. In 1943 further modifications were made including redesign of the crankcase sump shield and fitting of the Vokes high capacity air cleaner, which was a box shaped canister on top of the fuel tank and was intended to assist operations in dusty environments. [...] In early 1945 a push-button switch was introduced for the headlight and the <b>main</b> <b>lighting</b> switch relocated to a bracket beneath the offside of the saddle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was established}} in 1907 and automated in 2002. The 16 m tall tower {{is attached to a}} lighthouse keeper's house.

50|$|Many modern {{vehicles}} use HID bulbs for the <b>main</b> <b>lighting</b> systems, some {{applications are}} now moving from HID bulbs to LED and laser technology. However, this HID technology {{is not new}} and was first demonstrated by Francis Hauksbee in 1705.|$|E
50|$|The {{platform}} floor is laid with polished granite of different tones {{arranged in a}} geometrical ornament artwork. The ceiling is a monolithic concrete, with deep cessons that are covered with matted white glass which forms the <b>main</b> <b>lighting</b> of the station.|$|E
50|$|The central span also {{contains}} a suspended ceiling, but is curved to create a vaulted shape. The large opaque white fragments are shaped to appear suspended from the blue vault. The <b>main</b> <b>lighting</b> elements are hidden behind the white opaque glass, and is turned on during the nighttime giving the station two distinctively separate aesthetics.|$|E

50|$|The {{most recent}} codes of {{practice}} require the designer to allow for both failure of the supply to {{the building and the}} failure of an individual lighting circuit. BS5266 requires that when Non Maintained fittings are used, they must be supplied from the same final circuit as the <b>main</b> <b>lighting</b> circuit in the area.|$|E
50|$|It {{is owned}} by Moto. The 11-mile £19m Chiswick-Langley section of the M4 (London - South Wales Motorway) opened on Wednesday 24 March 1965, {{together}} with the Heathrow Airport spur. During construction of this section, much vandalism took place near Harmondsworth and Harlington. The lighting of the site {{was provided by the}} street lighting division of British Lighting Industries. The 100ft <b>main</b> <b>lighting</b> columns were supplied by British Steel Corporation's Northern and Tubes Group (Stewarts & Lloyds).|$|E
50|$|The {{walls are}} lined with stone benches, and at the western butt wall, next to the door, there is a broad archway for the {{numerous}} pilgrims to navigate. Decoration is concentrated only in the central sections of the roofing, near the <b>main</b> <b>lighting</b> apertures. The transition from the rectangle of their base to the octagon of the top is decorated with tre- and quatrefoils. The low abutments determine {{the size of the}} upstretched arches. The proportionally diminishing architectural shapes create the impression of airiness and space.|$|E
50|$|The first lightvessel {{conversion}} to solar power {{was made in}} 1995, and all vessels except the '20 class' have now been converted. The '20 class' is a slightly larger type of vessel that derives its power from diesel electric generators. Where a <b>main</b> <b>light</b> with a visible range in excess of 20 nautical miles (37 km) is required, a '20 class' vessel is used, as the <b>main</b> <b>light</b> from a Trinity House solar lightvessel has a maximum range of 19 nautical miles (35 km).|$|R
5000|$|The first {{lighthouse}} in Muskegon was {{a wooden}} tower atop the Keeper’s Quarters built in 1851. It was situated on land. In 1871 Muskegon Breakwater Light {{was built on}} the end of the breakwater and the <b>main</b> <b>light</b> was rebuilt. [...] In 1902, it was determined that the <b>main</b> <b>light</b> should be relocated to the south pierhead. The metalwork and steel plate used to construct the pierhead tower was delivered in 1903, and the cast iron octagonal lantern room from the 1870 lighthouse was transferred.|$|R

5000|$|The {{switches}} may be {{single or}} multiple, designed for indoor or outdoor use. Optional extras may include dimmer-controls, environmental protection, weather and security protection. In residential and light commercial lighting systems, {{the light switch}} directly controls the circuit feeding the lamps. In larger lighting systems, for example warehouses or outdoor lighting systems, the required current may be too high for a manual switch. In these systems light switches control lighting contactors, a relay that allows the manual light switch to operate on a lower voltage or with smaller wiring than would be required in the <b>main</b> <b>lighting</b> circuit.|$|E

50|$|The {{engine room}} took up two floors, the upper floor {{could only be}} entered through the engine room from below. The bottom of the upper floor {{consisted}} of steel beams and plates. For power generation, the bunker had two diesel generators in the engine room. These were water-cooled, four-cylinder, four-stroke engines, generating 38 hp each. The alternators each produced 28 kW of three-phase, alternating current at 380 volts. This powered the electric motors in the bunker, the electric heaters in the accommodation and the boilers and hobs in the kitchen. The <b>main</b> <b>lighting</b> was supplied at 220 volts. Sensitive areas were operated by accumulator batteries to ensure continuity of power available in case the generators failed. This delivered a 24 volt power supply to light the battle positions and the optics as well powering the emergency lighting. The radio room of the bunker had its own separate 24-volt batteries. Today, the generators have been removed.|$|E
5000|$|According to critic Tim Robey, {{the film}} has a [...] "stately, painterly, often determinedly static quality." [...] For example, to help light some {{interior}} scenes, lights were placed outside and aimed through the windows, which were covered in a diffuse material to scatter the light evenly through the room rather than being placed inside for maximum use as most conventional films do. A sign of this method occurs in the scene where Barry duels Lord Bullingdon. Though {{it appears to be}} lit entirely with natural light, one can see that the light coming in through the cross-shaped windows in the tithe barn appears blue in color, while the <b>main</b> <b>lighting</b> of the scene coming in from the side is not. This is because the light through the cross-shaped windows is daylight from the sun, which when recorded on the film stock used by Kubrick showed up as blue-tinted compared to the incandescent electric light coming in from the side.|$|E
50|$|The {{stage set}} {{included}} truck exhaust pipes for microphone stands, which were built with electroluminescent lights. A Soft-LED video drapery from <b>Main</b> <b>Light</b> Industries {{was used to}} display various images of the band's early years and music videos.|$|R

50|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was built}} between 1912 and 1913 as a sector light to warn ships of a sand {{bank in the}} approach to the Lister Tief nautical channel {{and to have a}} supplement to the <b>main</b> <b>light</b> at Kampen, 2.5 kilometres to the south. It became operational in 1913 and was electrified in 1936. Until its deactivation in 1975 it was maintained by the keepers of the Kampen lighthouse. When Rotes Kliff was extinguished, the <b>main</b> <b>light</b> at Kampen took over its part with a red section of light. Today the tower serves as a daymark without any lighting facility and is owned by the Kampen municipality who financed a restoration of the tower in 1993.|$|R
