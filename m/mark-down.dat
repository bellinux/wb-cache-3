The rule would also state that exercising investment discretion is not solely incidental to brokerage business, and thus, a broker-dealer providing discretionary advice would be deemed to be an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act. In addition, under the rule, broker-dealers would not be subject to the Investment Advisers Act solely because they offer full-service brokerage and discount brokerage services, including electronic brokerage, for reduced commission rates. Finally, the Commission is proposing to issue a statement of interpretive position that would clarify when certain brokerdealer advisory services, including financial planning, are solely incidental to brokerage business.

40|$|The {{relevance}} of manufacturing and logistics management in fashion companies has strongly {{increased in the}} last years due to the higher and higher demand inpredictability, which results in high holding costs, stock-outs and <b>mark-downs.</b> As a consequence, fashion companies that compete in the mass market, where margins are rather low, are striving to increase their efficiency in order to preserve good levels of profitability and, consequently, are promoting projects aimed at improving their logistics performances. On the opposite, companies involved in the prêt a porter segment seem not to suffer from such problems, thanks to their definitely high price levels that still hedge them from the negative impacts of demand incredictability. However, there is a third category of fahion companies that operate in an intermediate segment, called bridge, where, although prices are definitely lower than in the prêt a porter segment, the need for improving efficiency and effectiveness of the logistic process, from procurement to delivery, seems not to be perceived by the management. This study aims at understanding why such companies hardly implement the principles of supply chain management, even though logistics performances are key drivers for the profitability of these firms, and discusses the hypothesis according to which the main cause of this behaviour lies in a poor understanding of the competences necessary to fulfill logistics activities. In the remainder of this paper a brief analysis of the literature about supply chain management in fashion companies and about the competence theory is presented. Then, a qualitative study is proposed, which discusses a case-study developed in an Italian bridge company that have coped with the above mentioned problems. Then, the main conclusions are drawn...|$|R

In particular, the common "cost-plus mark-up" rule often adopted by real world sellers is dominated by another pure mark-up rule, computed with respect to the value of the good to the seller. However, overall efficiency is maximized when both the seller and the buyer compute their mark-up/mark-down with respect to their costs...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the performance}} of a part of the South African market by studying the transmission mechanism of some selected market prices, price spreads and market volatility in the market. A comparative assessment of future forecasts for import and export prices is also conducted using three forecasting models - double exponential smoothing, Winters' multiplicative method and the Box-Jenkins forecasting method. The analyses reveal that a cointegrating relationship exists between producer and consumer prices of goods, producer prices Granger-cause consumer prices but not the reverse, the transmission between producer and consumer prices of goods is asymmetrical, and price transmission is elastic and perfect in the mark-up model but inelastic and imperfect in the <b>mark-down</b> price transmission model. The producer price shock effect is observed with a total consumer price increase after 4 periods (1 year), exchange rates significantly explain import prices (but {{only a small part of}} oil prices), and low standard deviations of the cyclical components of the import and export prices are observed suggesting high volatility of the prices.

40|$|This paper uses a {{microeconomics}} {{perspective to}} derive an economically meaningful energy efficiency measure. We {{contribute to the}} literature by deriving the measure based on neoclassical economic theory. Energy intensity, {{the most frequently used}} energy efficiency measure, is a technical average measure drawn from the engineering-science perspective and is not derived from microeconomic foundations, based on marginal production concepts. We address the particular problems associated with this measure and, unlike the literature, introduce the energy shadow value as an economic marginal energy efficiency measure. We describe at least two methods to model the energy index and derive energy shadow value based on a dual profit function: a quasi-fixed approach, treating energy use as quasi-fixed factor; and a directly nested <b>mark-down</b> and up approach, nesting the energy shadow price into the profit function; we discuss which approach is most useful and appropriate to derive an explicit energy shadow value model. We conclude that quasi-fixed approach offers more advantages when deriving a dynamic energy efficiency measure. The paper addresses fallacies of using energy intensity measure and how the shadow value indicator can be applied to address international energy efficiency comparisons and impacting factors particularly capital, technology, and environmental obligations...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a decentralized supply chain {{consisting of a}} retailer and a supplier that serves forward-looking consumers in two periods. In each period, the supplier and the retailer dynamically set the wholesale and retail price to maximize their own profits. The consumers are heterogeneous in their evaluations of the product and are strategic in deciding whether and when to buy the product, choosing the option that maximizes their utility, including waiting for a price <b>mark-down.</b> We derive the equilibrium and study the value of price and quantity commitments from both the retailer’s and the supplier’s perspective. We find that, while a centralized system always benefits from making price and quantity commitments, {{this is not true}} for a firm in a decentralized supply chain due to how the other firm reacts to these commitments. We show that the retailer suffers from making a price or quantity commitment and that, similarly, the supplier does not benefit from making a price commitment. In these cases, commitments can harm not only the firm itself but also profitability of the other firm in the supply chain, thereby disadvantaging the entire supply chain. This happens because such commitments aggravate double-marginalization inefficiency in the supply chain...|$|E
40|$|Using {{data from}} the U. S. bicycle industry, we examine the {{relation}} among product variety, supply chain structure, and firm performance. Variety imposes two types of costs on a supply chain: production costs and market mediation costs. Production costs include, among other costs, the incremental fixed investments associated with providing additional product variants. Market mediation costs arise because of uncertainty in product demand created by variety. In the presence of demand uncertainty, precisely matching supply with demand is difficult. Market mediation costs include the variety-related inventory holding costs, product <b>mark-down</b> costs occurring when supply exceeds demand, {{and the costs of}} lost sales occurring when demand exceeds supply. We analyze product variety at the product attribute level, noting that the relative impact of variety on production and market mediation costs depends to a large extent on the attribute underlying the variety. That is, some types of variety incur high production costs and some types of variety incur high market mediation costs. We characterize supply chain structure by the degree to which production facilities are scale-efficient and by the distance of the production facility from the target market. We hypothesize that firms with scale-efficient production (i. e., high-volume firms) will offer types of variety associated with high production costs, and firms with local production will offer types of variety associated with high market mediation costs. This hypothesis implies that there is a coherent way to match product variety with supply chain structure. Empirical results suggest that firms which match supply chain structure to the type of product variety they offer outperform firms which fail to match such choices.

40|$|In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde ein möglicher Zusammenhang zwischen der sozialen Verantwortung eines Unternehmens – auch bekannt als Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) – und der daraus resultierenden Zahlungsbereitschaft von KundInnen unter Verwendung einer anreizkompatiblen Untersuchungsmethode analysiert. Dahingehend wurden Vickrey Auktionen mit einer Stichprobe von insgesamt 122 Studenten durchgeführt. Den Untersuchungsgegenstand der Vickrey Auktion stellte ein USB-Stick eines fiktiven Unternehmens dar und die CSR Komponente wurde durch frei erfundene Zeitungsartikel manipuliert. Die Datenanalyse zeigt einen positiven Zusammenhang zwischen CSR und der Zahlungsbereitschaft von Konsumenten. Zudem wurde festgestellt, dass der Preisabschlag im Falle von negativer CSR auf die durchschnittliche Zahlungsbereitschaft der Kontrollgruppe in Relation viel größer ist als der Preisaufschlag bei positiver CSR. Die Ergebnisse der Untersuchung lassen zudem darauf schließen, dass die Einstellung gegenüber einer Marke den Einfluss von CSR auf die Zahlungsbereitschaft teilweise mediiert und Konstrukte wie die persönliche Relevanz der vom Unternehmen adressierten CSR Aspekte oder die Wichtigkeit, die der CSR bei der Kaufentscheidung beigemessen wird, diesen Zusammenhang teilweise moderieren. The {{subject of}} the master thesis was to {{investigate}} a possible relationship between Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and the willingness to pay (WTP) of consumers through an incentive-compatible research method.

In this sense, it was also found that the average <b>mark-down</b> in case of negative CSR information is – compared to the control group which did not receive any information about a company's CSR – much higher than the mark-up that consumers {{would be willing to pay}} in the case of high CSR. Furthermore, brand attitude partially mediates the relationship between CSR and the WTP and variables such as the support of the CSR domain – which describes the individuals’ favorability of the specific issues that a company addresses with its CSR activities – or the importance that a person places on CSR as buying criteria, partially moderate this relationship...|$|E
40|$|The problem {{faced in}} this paper is a {{periodic}} pricing of inventory with obsolescence and an unknown time horizon. Typical inventory items with these properties are music CDs. The periodic pricing of music CDs {{is used as a}} tool to manipulate the demand thereof as they become less popular. A CD will, however, not perish in the time it is kept as inventory, {{as is the case with}} perishable inventory. This property accounts for the obsolescence. Other kinds of items in inventory that also become obsolete are typical fashion goods, like clothes. Contrary to CDs the demand for these goods do have a known time horizon (usually at the end of a season). The paper starts out by giving an introduction to the problems faced in a CD shop. Background information is given on how CD shops operate. The method of pricing CDs is explained. The current policy at a CD shop of when, and how many orders are placed is explained. This introduction is followed by an overview of relevant literature on various types of inventory problems. The review is structured according to the three properties of the problem. The first property is the pricing of items in inventory. The second property is that items in inventory may be considered as inventory with a random lifetime. The third property is that the items in inventory become obsolete. The subject of the pricing of inventory has received substantial attention in the operations research literature over the years. The conclusion after consultation of the references on the periodic pricing of inventory is that all these articles have two characteristics in common: the time horizon of the items in inventory are considered to be fixed and it is known by how much the price will change. In the problem under consideration only the second characteristic may be assumed. The objective in most of the literature is to find the time when, and how many times the price should be changed. The second property deals with inventory with a stochastic lifetime. By far the most literature on inventory with a stochastic lifetime appears under the banner of perishable inventory. Perishable inventory consist of inventories that deteriorates (damage, spoil, vaporise, etc.) as time elapses, regardless of how intensively it is used. Perishable inventory may be classified into three main groups, namely inventory with a fixed lifetime (sell-by date), stochastic lifetime inventory and inventory that deteriorates according to some law (for example, proportional to the number of items in inventory). CDs fall into the middle group, but do not deteriorate as such. A rich body of literature exists on the subject of perishable inventory with a stochastic lifetime. In this literature the main objective is to determine the optimal order quantity and reorder point. This is because deteriorating inventory is replaced by the same product on the shelf, which is not the case with CDs. CDs are replaced with a different product once it has become obsolete. This body of literature is thus not very relevant to this study, because the aim of the study is not to find optimal order quantities or reorder points, but the points in time at which the prices should be changed. The third property is obsolescence. Very little was found on this subject in the literature and most of the existing work considered clearance sales at the end of a season. A problem where these three properties are combined could not be found. Two heuristic approaches to minimise the loss made on inventory with the properties as described above, are presented. The first heuristic was developed in conjunction with the manager of a CD shop. This method allows one to set a date (T 0) when the demand for a CD will vanish. The heuristic predicts whether or not the inventory in hand will be sold out before that date at the current price. If not, the price should be lowered. This method allows the manager to answer “what if” questions, by fixing T 0 at different values. The second heuristic does not require manual input. It calculates the time (T(Pi)) when the inventory carrying cost is equal to the selling price less the buying price (profit), because after this point the CD must be sold at a loss. The heuristic then predicts the sales and calculates whether the inventory in hand will be sold out before or after T(Pi). If the inventory cannot be sold out before T(Pi), the price should be lowered to increase the demand. Finally a case study is presented. The performance of the different demand curves are tested with a simulation of actual data from a CD shop to measure the performance of the heuristics against the current <b>mark-down</b> strategies followed. The conclusion is that both heuristics outperform the current pricing policy of the shop management...|$|E
