As Vladimir sleeps, Sdenka walks outside and finds Gorca and his family surrounding her. Vladimir awakens and searches for Sdenka, finding her lying <b>motionless</b> <b>in</b> her bed at home. Sdenka awakens and upon receiving Vladimir's embrace, she bites into his neck.|$|E
5|$|Madonna premiered {{the song}} at a benefit concert at Madison Square Garden {{to raise money}} for medical {{research}} for AIDS. She dedicated the song to the memory of her friend, artist Martin Burgoyne. Madonna has since performed the song on three of her world tours. In 1987, during the Who's That Girl World Tour, she performed the song standing <b>motionless</b> <b>in</b> a single spotlight, wearing a black ensemble with tassels, golden tips and ribbing, designed by Marlene Stewart. Two different performances of the song on this tour {{can be found on the}} videos: Who's That Girl: Live in Japan, filmed in Tokyo, Japan, on June 22, 1987, and , filmed in Turin, Italy, on September 4, 1987.|$|E
5|$|The Tasmanian {{numbfish}} is {{a fairly}} inactive species that spends {{long periods of time}} buried <b>motionless</b> <b>in</b> sediment. It feeds primarily on polychaete worms (particularly those of the family Maldanidae) and crustaceans (including amphipods, decapods, and tanaids). Nematodes and sipunculids may also be consumed on rare occasions. Juvenile rays consume polychaetes and crustaceans in roughly equal proportions, while adults consume mostly polychaetes. This dietary shift may reflect increasing experience with age, as polychaetes are burrowing animals and thus more difficult to locate and capture than crustaceans. Like other members of its family, the Tasmanian numbfish can defend itself with a modest electric shock. Its predators include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). The tapeworm Anthobothrium hickmani is a parasite of this species.|$|E

5|$|He {{is said to}} have meditated <b>motionless</b> <b>in</b> a {{standing}} posture (kayotsarga) for a year, during which time climbing plants grew around his legs. However, he was adamant and continued his practice unmindful of the vines, ants, and dust that enveloped his body. According to Jain text Ādi purāṇa, {{on the last day of}} Bahubali's one year long fast, Bharata came in all humility to Bahubali and worshiped him with veneration and respect. A painful regret that he had been the cause of his elder brother's humiliation had been disturbing Bahubali's meditation; this was dispersed when Bharata worshipped him. Bahubali was then able to destroy the four kinds of inimical karmas, including the knowledge obscuring karma, and he attained omniscience (kevala gyana). He was now revered as an omniscient being (Kevali). Bahubali finally attained liberation (moksha) and became a pure, liberated soul (siddha). He is said to be the first Digambara monk to have attained moksha in the present half-cycle of time (Avasarpiṇī).|$|E

25|$|Most {{members of}} this family are ambush predators, in that they {{typically}} remain <b>motionless</b> <b>in</b> a camouflaged position, and then strike suddenly at passing prey.

Reports of attacks on human beings were once more common in South and Southeast Asia, but are now quite rare.|$|E

25|$|In 1927, Engelbert Zaschka, a {{pioneering}} German engineer, invented a combined helicopter and autogyro.

25|$|In the mid- to late-1990s, San Francisco {{grew more}} prosperous and its {{population}} expanded {{with the advent}} of the dot-com boom, and the Metro system began to feel the strain of increased commuter demand. Muni criticism had been something of a feature of life in San Francisco, and not without reason. The Boeing trains were sub-par and grew crowded quickly. And the difficulty in running a hybrid streetcar and light rail system, with five lines merging into one, led to scheduling problems on the main trunk lines with long waits between arrivals and commuter-packed trains sometimes sitting <b>motionless</b> <b>in</b> tunnels for extended periods of time.|$|E

25|$|In June 1985, tragedy strikes for the Osmans when Sue awakes to {{discover}} baby Hassan laying <b>motionless</b> <b>in</b> his cot. Sue and Ali rush his lifeless body to local nurse, Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson), but Hassan is already dead. A postmortem reveals no definitive cause of death, {{so it is}} concluded that he died during his sleep from cot death. After discovering Hassan's body, Sue goes into shock. She remains in a trance like state for weeks, refusing to eat, sleep, cry or acknowledge her own grief. She later begins blaming herself unfairly for her son's sudden and unexplainable death. Her mental health continues to deteriorate and she becomes despondent towards Ali; their marriage disintegrates in a welter of depression. Sue eventually manages {{to come to terms}} with Hassan's death with the help of Dr Legg (Leonard Fenton), who takes the desperate measure of placing Mary's baby, Annie, in her lap, allowing her, finally, to acknowledge her pent-up sadness.|$|E

500|$|This species {{lives in}} small groups and is very shy, often {{remaining}} in dense vegetation to avoid detection, and therefore its ecology is very little studied. It is believed that the francolin may migrate from lower altitudes to higher altitudes and juniper forest in the warmer months. Its main predator is the common genet. The bird is most active and most likely to call between 6am and 9am. After this it may {{spend most of the}} day perched <b>motionless</b> <b>in</b> a tree up to [...] above the ground. It eats berries, seeds, termites and figs. It scratches the ground to collect seeds and, when it finds an area disturbed by warthogs, also scratches the ground for termites. It is monogamous and breeds between December and February.|$|E

500|$|Distortions of self-experience such as {{feeling as}} if one's {{thoughts}} or feelings are not really one's own to believing thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common. There is often an observable pattern of emotional difficulty, for example lack of responsiveness. Impairment in social cognition is associated with schizophrenia, as are symptoms of paranoia. Social isolation commonly occurs. Difficulties in working and long-term memory, attention, executive functioning, and speed of processing also commonly occur. In one uncommon subtype, the person may be largely mute, remain <b>motionless</b> <b>in</b> bizarre postures, or exhibit purposeless agitation, all signs of catatonia.
