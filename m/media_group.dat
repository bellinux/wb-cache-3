40|$|This article {{examines}} the dynamics of Portuguese <b>media</b> <b>groups</b> {{in a context of}} worldwide financialization, and the new media regulation authority established in 2008. It considers the economic and financial performance of the major <b>media</b> <b>groups,</b> in an environment characterized by staff dismissals and decreasing advertising revenue. This focus on the dynamics of <b>media</b> <b>groups</b> is combined with the analysis of the performance of a new media regulator, established in 2006, which has been allocated specific powers to control ownership concentration. From documentary analysis I will highlight the acquiescence of the media regulator to the ‘media in crisis’ argument, the consequences of which include a concentration of local radio and a silence surrounding job cuts in otherwise profitable <b>media</b> <b>groups.</b> A disturbing consequence of the crisis concerns the vulnerability of this sector to capital investment funds, notably Angolan, whose ownership structure lacks transparency...|$|R

40|$|Corporate {{websites}} enable {{companies to}} communicate with {{a broad range of}} publics and address their different interests on sites respectively. Although corporate websites have existed for decades, there is hardly any simple standard or rules related to the content and design features. This dissertation has developed a framework to examine the corporate website of Chinese <b>media</b> <b>groups.</b> There are few researches on Chinese <b>media</b> <b>groups,</b> since they have been viewed as the apparatus of the government, but recent decades the nature of business has been highlighted. The framework differentiates website content features from design features. The content component addressing the different information needs of various stakeholders includes four dimensions. The design component contains usability, interactivity, security and credibility dimensions. This framework has been applied to examine the differences between four categories of Chinese media groups' corporate websites and between the corporate website of Chinese <b>media</b> <b>groups</b> and that of Western transnational media companies. The results of this research indicate that the distinctions of corporate websites between different categories of Chinese <b>media</b> <b>groups</b> are meaningful in five dimensions of content and design features, and the differences of sites between Chinese <b>media</b> <b>groups</b> and Western transnational media companies are very significant in four dimensions of content and design features...|$|R
