2500|$|An early American {{electrical}} {{plug and socket}} was invented by Harvey Hubbell and patented in 1904. Hubbell's first design was a socket which screwed into a lampholder (like the early lampholder plugs), but with a separable plug with pins (...) or blades (US patent 774251). The 1906 Hubbell catalog shows the blade plug with a flush <b>mounting</b> <b>socket</b> for use in wall or floor. Other manufacturers adopted the Hubbell pattern, and by 1915 they were widespread.|$|E

50|$|Different {{versions}} of the instrument also took different forms and adopted additional features. The type publicised by Hood was intended {{for use as a}} surveying instrument, and included not only sights and a <b>mounting</b> <b>socket</b> for attaching the instrument to a pole or post, but also an arc scale and an additional sliding leg. Galileo's earliest examples were intended to be used as gunner's levels as well as calculating devices.|$|E

50|$|For {{infantry}} use, the Schwarzlose {{was usually}} {{employed as a}} traditional, tripod mounted, heavy machine gun served by a crew {{of at least three}} soldiers, one of whom was the commander, usually an NCO, a gunner who carried the weapon, a third soldier who served as an ammunition carrier and loader and he would presumably also carry the tripod although in practice a fourth soldier might be added to the team to carry the tripod. Another less commonly seen method of deployment was the more compact 'backpack mount'. In this configuration the gun was fitted with a backwards folding bipod attached {{to the front of the}} water jacket near the muzzle. The backpack mount itself consisted of a square wooden frame with a metal socket in the center. When the gun was fully deployed the frame was laid on the ground, the gun's central mounting point that usually attached to a tripod now had a small mounting pin attached to it instead which was inserted into the <b>mounting</b> <b>socket</b> in the center of the wooden backpack frame and finally the bipod was folded forward. The Schwarzlose would also have seen service as a fortress weapon in which case it would have been deployed on a variety of heavy and specialized fixed mountings and it also saw some use as a naval weapon aboard ship. During World War I the Schwarzlose was also pressed into service as an anti-aircraft gun and as such it was deployed using a variety of often improvised mountings.|$|E
50|$|Matching sockets for the G9.5 base include Sylvania TP22, TP220, Buhl Electric QEW-2, QEW-21, QEW-22, Bender + Wirth 968, Ushio: C-3, C-3(A). The {{calibration}} lamps {{are generally}} modified {{to use a}} larger bi-post base that fits into special kinematic <b>mount</b> <b>sockets</b> for precise optical alignment. Although the socket for calibration lamps is not polarized, polarity must be observed because the calibration lamps are normally run on DC and the lamp filament will recrystallize according to the applied DC polarity.|$|R
25|$|Also called combo consoles, {{these are}} usually hard rubber or tough plastic moldings which enclose the SPG and have <b>mounting</b> <b>sockets</b> for other diver instrumentation, such as {{decompression}} computers, underwater compass, timer and/or depth gauge and occasionally {{a small plastic}} slate on which notes can be written either before or during the dive. These instruments would otherwise be carried somewhere else such as strapped to the wrist or forearm or in a pocket and are only regulator accessories for convenience of transport and access, and {{at greater risk of}} damage during handling.|$|R
50|$|A similar type of {{furniture}} {{was made for}} naval service, and even for merchant ships, which allowed furnishings {{to be used in}} port or peacetime, but stowed out of harm's way in action, or during rough weather. Naval furniture is often extremely small, reflecting the cramped quarters available on ship. (Some sea-going pieces were also made for frequent travelers, or intended for permanent use after the journey.) Seagoing furniture sometimes has fiddle rails to prevent items from sliding off top surfaces; the fiddles were often themselves removable, with brass <b>mounting</b> <b>sockets</b> for the fiddle pins.|$|R

The guitar has a pair of open-coil humbucking pickups with black bobbins, master volume/TBX tone controls and a 3-way pickup selector, all on body, and a side <b>mounted</b> jack <b>socket.</b> It also has a 2-point System I locking vibrato unit.|$|R
5000|$|Screw-locking {{versions}} of this connector have also been used in instrumentation, process control and professional audio. In North America this variant is often called a [...] "small Tuchel" [...] connector {{after one of the}} major manufacturers. Tuchel is now a division of Amphenol. Additional configurations up to 24 pins are also offered in the same shell size. A version with a bayonet locking ring was used on portable tape recorders, dictation machines and lighting dimmers and controls through the from the 1960's to the 1980's, an example of this is the microphone input connector and some others on the [...] "Report" [...] family of UHER (brand) tape recorders. The bayonet locking version is sometimes referred to by the trade name Preh. Belling Lee offered a version with a sprung-loaded collar which latched on insertion but required the collar to be pulled back to release the connector, similar to the LEMO B series connector. This connector was commonly referred to as the [...] "Bleecon", an example of its use is the Strand Tempus range of theatrical lighting dimmers and control desks. A version with a pushbutton latch similar to that on an XLR cable <b>mounted</b> <b>socket</b> was also available. Female connectors with screw-locking, Bleecon or bayonet latching features are compatible with standard DIN plugs.|$|R
50|$|The QFP {{component}} {{package type}} became common in Europe and United States {{during the early}} nineties, {{even though it has}} been used in Japanese consumer electronics since the seventies. It is often mixed with hole <b>mounted,</b> and sometimes <b>socketed,</b> components on the same printed circuit board.|$|R
50|$|This {{arrangement}} is an electromechanical inverter circuit. The vibrator switches {{used for this}} purpose wore out after a time, so they were usually encased in a steel or aluminum can with a plug for easy replacement when <b>mounted</b> in a <b>socket</b> similar to those used for tubes.|$|R
50|$|Like most {{integrated}} circuits {{of the period}} 1963-1990, commercial TTL devices are usually packaged in dual in-line packages (DIPs), usually with 14 to 24 pins, for through-hole or <b>socket</b> <b>mounting.</b> The DIPs were usually made of epoxy plastic (PDIP) for commercial-grade parts or of ceramic (CDIP) for military-grade parts.|$|R
5000|$|Some vehicle {{manufacturers}} provide mounting points {{in some of}} their vehicles designed to accept cargo barriers. [...] In other cases, for reasons of safety, rather than utilizing mounting points designed for child restraints and other purposes, many cargo barriers require specialized <b>mounting</b> brackets, <b>sockets,</b> rust preventatives and trim accessories to be fitted to the vehicle. In these cases, manufacturers may recommend that installation is performed by a trained fitter, as high technical competence is required to correctly install such mounting equipment. A trained fitter may require {{a few hours to}} perform such an installation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Socket</b> <b>mounting</b> {{avoids the}} need to machine {{the face of the}} flange during attachment. For choke flanges this means that the depth to which the face is recessed, and the width of the {{resulting}} gap is fixed when the flange is manufactured and will not change when it is attached. MIL-spec choke flanges are socket-mounted.|$|R
50|$|In {{the most}} normal use, cables have a {{standard}} plug on each end, {{consisting of a}} central male connector, surrounded by a ring. The ring is often segmented to provide spring gripping pressure when mated. Devices <b>mount</b> the <b>socket</b> (female jack), consisting of a central hole with a ring of metal around it. The ring is slightly larger in diameter and longer than the ring on the plug, allowing the plug's ring to fit tightly over it. The jack has a small area between the outer and inner rings which is filled with an insulator, typically plastic (very early versions, or those made for use as RF connectors, used ceramic).|$|R
50|$|For {{use by the}} Royal Observer Corps, the {{instrument}} was also provided in the fixed version designated the PDRM82(F). The fixed version had an external coaxial <b>socket</b> <b>mounted</b> on its rear that accepted a cable from the above ground ionisation detector under a polycarbonate dome. For training purposes, timed simulated readings could be fed to the meter from an EPROM.|$|R
50|$|Cylindrical plugs {{generally}} have an insulated tip constructed to accept insertion of a pin. The outer {{body of the}} plug is one contact, most often but not always the negative side of the supply. A pin <b>mounted</b> in the <b>socket</b> makes contact with a second internal contact. The outer plug contact is often called the barrel, sleeve or ring, while the inner one is called the tip.|$|R
500|$|The {{amplifier}} has {{bass and}} treble tone controls which, {{according to the}} manufacturer, are [...] "tailored for musically effective response in {{the high and low}} frequencies without altering the critical mid-range tonal balance". A loudness switch– de rigueur in that era– boosts upper and lower frequencies; a [...] "mute" [...] switch reduces volume by 20 dB for low-level listening. There is also a headphone <b>socket</b> <b>mounted</b> onto the front panel.|$|R

50|$|A svärdstav (literally sword-staff) is a Swedish medieval polearm that {{consists}} of a two-edged sword blade attached to a 2-metre staff. The illustrations often show the weapon being equipped with sword-like quillons. The illustrations sometimes show a <b>socket</b> <b>mount</b> and reinforcing langets being used, but sometimes they are missing; it is possible this weapon was sometimes manufactured by simply attaching an old sword blade onto a long pole on its tang, not unlike the naginata.|$|R
