40|$|Suppressive {{effects of}} {{different}} compost teas were evaluated against the phytopathogens P. capsici and P. parasitica, isolated from diseased plants from commercial sweet pepper farms in Almer√≠a (Spain), during 2011. Aerated compost tea and non-aerated compost tea were prepared from spent mushroom compost, grape <b>marc</b> <b>compost,</b> crop residues compost and vermicompost. In vitro inhibition of mycelial {{growth of the}} two tested pathogens was assessed, and in vivo effects of compost teas on disease severity, caused by P. capsici and P. parasitica were evaluated on pepper plants, in greenhouse experiments. Different morphological parameters were also measured for plants treated with compost teas, to determine growth promotion effects on pepper plants. The compost teas controlled the two tested pathogens in vitro and in vivo. Non-aerated compost teas (NCT) were more beneficial in increasing growth of pepper plants than aerated compost teas. This study demonstrates the clear effect of compost tea on disease suppression and plant growth promotion. These compost extracts {{may be used as}} alternatives to inorganic fertilizers/fungicides to enhance plant growth, reduce disease incidence and increase crop yields...|$|E
40|$|Industrial cork residue, {{grape marc}} {{and olive oil}} husk + cotton gin trash (2 / 3, v/v) were {{composted}} in 40 m 3 windrows and turned each week. Composting took a variable time depending on the materials (4. 5 to 8. 5 months). During composting grape marc pile and cork pile were fertilized with ammonium nitrate, superphosphate, iron sulphate and magnesium sulphate. The evolution of temperature, pH, mineral nitro-gen (N NH 4 + and N NO 3), total nitrogen, organic matter, C/N ratio, electrical conductivity and cation exchange capacity were measured each week. In order to estimate compost maturity, phytotoxicity test, employing index germination, and nitrogen drawdown index (NDI) were used. With curing time, organic matter and C/N ratio decreased, whereas CEC increased and pH was constant. Microbial biomass, micro-bial activity were measured in mature compost. Cork compost showed the highest beta glucosidase acti-vity followed by grape <b>marc</b> <b>compost.</b> Olive oil husk + cotton gin trash compost showed the lowest acti-vity. The composts were used as growing media for geranium and petunia during 15 weeks. The worst results were obtained when olive oil husk + cotton gin trash {{were used in the}} composted mixtures. In these cases plants showed a lower development and leaf chlorosis. This can be explained as a consequence of nutritional disorders and/or the possible presence of phytotoxic organic substances...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe marine {{halophytes}} Arthrocnemum macrostachyum and Halimione portulacoides {{are found}} growing naturally in saltmarshes within Greece creating an aesthetically pleasing groundcover that also reflects {{the changing of}} seasons. The potential use of these species in an extensive green roof system in coastal areas would lead to additional benefits such as preserving and enhancing the local landscape character and supporting biodiversity. The growth of Arthrocnemum macrostachyum and Halimione portulacoides in an extensive green roof system under two watering regimes (30 % ET 0 and 15 % ET 0) was investigated. The substrates used consisted of soil (S), pumice (Pum) and grape <b>marc</b> <b>compost</b> (C) or peat (P), at various volumetric proportions indicated by the subscripts: S 15 :Pum 70 :C 15, S 15 :Pum 70 :P 15 and S 15 :Pum 70 :P 7. 5 :C 7. 5. Biometric measurements to determine plant growth included plant height and diameter, growth index, dry weights and ground cover. The growth of both plant species was similar under both watering regimes until elevated summer temperatures lead to plant loss in the reduced watering regime (15 % ET 0). Both shoot and root dry weights of both plant species {{at the end of}} the experiment were greater under the 30 % ET 0 watering regime. Results indicated that both watering regimes (30 % ET 0 and 15 % ET 0) studied could be applied initially in the early summer months followed by watering with 30 % ET 0 at increased summer temperatures...|$|E
40|$|IWA Publishing 2009 <b>Composted</b> grape <b>marc,</b> {{produced}} at the vineyard using different procedures, is generally returned into the vineyard. Information on the chemical composition of these grape <b>marc</b> <b>composts</b> is lacking, particularly the variability {{that may result}} from different composting practices. In this study, grape <b>marc</b> <b>composts,</b> varying in age from 3 months to 3 years, were collected from four different vineyards and subjected to detailed chemical analysis. The chemical analysis revealed that all the grape <b>marc</b> <b>composts</b> contained levels of free potassium, {{in the range of}} 2 - 3 % w/w. Plant macronutrients such as Ca, S, Mg were present at low levels (< 1 % w/w), while phosphorus (0. 1 - 0. 3 % w/w) and nitrogen (1 - 2 % w/w) levels were not very high and mainly present in "plant unavailable" form. The levels of soluble salts, though not excessive, were elevated in all the composts. These salt levels could cause a problem in some soils. Heavy metals were not present in any significant levels. All the grape <b>marc</b> <b>composts</b> analysed provided some benefit in returning nutrients into the vineyard and all were significant potassium sources. G. (Jason) Issa, Antonio F. Patti, Ron Smernik and Kevin Wilkinso...|$|R

40|$|Biomixture {{composition}} and water management are key factors controlling biobeds performance. Although compost-biomixtures (BXs) possess high degradation efficiency, their low water-holding capacity compared with peat-biomixtures (OBX) limits their use. Thus, appropriate water management {{is required to}} optimize their performance. The dissipation capacity of selected BXs compared with OBXs was assessed in a column study under two water managements not differing in their total water load but in the intensity and frequency of water addition. Results showed that the less frequent application of large water volumes (water management scenario I) facilitated pesticide leaching (0. 001 - 10. 4 % of initially applied), compared with the frequent application of low water volumes (water management scenario II) where leaching losses were always < 1 %. Water management affected differently the dissipation performance of substrates: OBX outperformed BXs under water management scenario I, whereas the grape marc compost-biomixture (BX 1) was superior at water management scenario II. Substitution of grape <b>marc</b> <b>compost</b> (Cl) with olive leaves compost (C 2) or of straw with corn cobs or grape stalks reduced the dissipation capacity of BX 1. Mass balance analysis revealed that the high dissipation capacity of OBX was mostly attributable to its high ability to retain rather than degrade pesticides, whereas the exact opposite was seen for BX 1. Overall, {{our findings suggest that}} BXs-biobeds could treat large wastewater volumes under appropriate water management that extends the contact period between pesticides and BXs, thus exploiting their high biodegradation capacity...|$|E
