40|$|Right {{talent is}} the {{greatest}} asset for any enterprise {{and one of the}} essential roles of HR {{is to make sure that}} the employees with the right skills stick with the company for long enough. The issue with <b>many</b> <b>companies</b> <b>today</b> <b>is</b> that their organizations put tremendous effort into attracting employees to their company, but spend little time into retaining and developing talent. One of the most important factors that go into IT business is human capital, thus attracting the right talent, up-skilling, motivating and retaining them in the organization is essential. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), one of the leading software companies has adopted a scientific and innovative approach for harnessing talent management. The sustained strategic focus to enhance employee capability, improve efficiency and groom future leaders has helped TCS to maintain its benchmark status in the IT industry. To build a quality talent pool, TCS started various kinds of training programmes like Open Ignite, Academic Learning Collaboration, ILP, Aspire, Ambassador Corp, iCALMS and many more. TCS conducts training as a part of CSR activity for the inclusive growth of the society. Maitree, Udaan, Affirmative Action programs are such programs under CSR activity.

40|$|While <b>many</b> <b>companies</b> <b>today</b> <b>are</b> deeply {{investing}} in Knowledge Management (KM), they generally encounter substantial difficulties in measuring the value generated by those programmes. Actually, how KM-related {{costs and benefits}} can be effectively measured is still a puzzling problem both at the conceptual and operational level. This {{is due to the}} substantially intangible nature of such activities, as well as to their very long-term horizons. Since KM programmes are set up with the purpose to contribute to the business, trying to measure their value is absolutely necessary, not only for monitoring their effectiveness but also for successfully managing and allocating resources. An evaluation is also required to demonstrate the results achieved, which is essential to maintain the support and commitment by the top management. In literature, several KM performance evaluation methods and approaches have been proposed. However, these methods are still far from becoming an established practice. They are very heterogeneous, and often derive from techniques formerly developed for other goals, and combined with ad hoc elements; also, they are often poor in usability. In point of this, the paper aims at discussing such issues by placing them in a practical context. First, the literature on KM assessment is briefly reviewed, and the main methods that are currently in place are classified, with the purpose to stress their key features seen from a user perspective. Then, the practical experience of a multinational company is examined to describe the real problems that knowledge managers face in their daily experience of KM measurement, and provide insights into the possible future developments of the KM evaluation approaches...|$|E
40|$|<b>Many</b> <b>companies</b> <b>today</b> <b>are</b> {{using some}} form of uniforms for employees. This {{research}} is {{an exploration of the}} role of uniforms in contributing to the embedding and transmitting of organizational culture. Culture is the experiences and common learning of the organization that results in shared values and beliefs. According to Schein (1985 : 14) culture has three levels, namely: artifacts, values, and basic underlying assumptions. The first level of the culture consists of the physical constructs of the organization, and therefore includes the uniforms, which is the focus of this study. Schein (1985 : 223) further proposes that culture can be embedded and transmitted through various mechanisms. The research was conducted in the constructivist paradigm, at a tertiary institution of higher learning in Eastern Cape, South Africa. To ensure triangulation, three sources of data were used, namely: documentation; observation; and both individual and focus group interviews. The researcher argues that uniforms {{played a role in the}} embedding of the sample organization’s three levels of culture, which were expressed in terms of Hofstede’s (1991 : 07) culture dimensions. Firstly, the use of the different uniforms by different groups, as well as the ranking indicated by the uniforms, played a role in embedding the high power distance culture. Secondly, the symbolism of security portrayed by the uniform played a role in embedding the high uncertainty avoidance culture. Thirdly, it was found that the uniform created unity amongst groups, resulting in greater expression of collectivism. Fourthly, the use of sensible and practical uniforms plays a role in embedding the feminine culture where competitiveness is avoided and relationships are nurtured. Lastly, the uniform plays a possible role in transforming the culture from short-term to a long-term orientation that focuses on the future. ...|$|E
40|$|Corporate social {{responsibility}} {{has become the}} business issue of the 21 st century. Heightened expectations of the business sector, globalisation and increased media attention {{on the role of}} business in society are casting an intense spotlight on this issue. As a result, pressure has built on business to play a larger role in bringing about socio-economic development to many local communities where they operate. While for a long time companies {{have been involved in the}} community on a philanthropy basis, <b>many</b> <b>companies</b> <b>today</b> <b>are</b> reassessing the manner in which they conduct their corporate {{social responsibility}} programmes. Many companies are including corporate social responsibility issues into their strategic planning process and overall corporate strategy. Emphasis is given to certain strategic indicators that must be present in order for a company to be said to have taken a strategic approach to corporate social responsibility. This study adopted a critical-realist approach using a case study method to evaluate DaimlerChrysler South Africa’s corporate social investment programmes in the local community of the Border-Kei region against these strategic indicators. This new form of engagement is even challenging for a multinational corporation, which may feel that it is only obliged to assist the local community where its corporate headquarters is located. But as companies derive an everlarger share of revenue and profits from international operations, multinational companies are being called upon to redefine “community”, by looking beyond local, domestic and geographical communities to include those in regions where they have factories or factories operated by key suppliers. This study found that DCSA was strategically involved and had a good relationship with its local community.

To achieve this tough mission, the enterprises that comprise the United States aerospace and defense industries must form strategic partnerships and collaborations to utilize their respective resources, knowledge, and expertise to meet their customers' needs. Collaboration, be it between competing companies or within different divisions of the same company, {{is necessary for the}} survival of each company and the defense industry. In the past. United States aerospace and defense company relationships consisted mostly of a prime contractor. with sub-contractors providing a specific hardware or software subsystem. as specified by the prime contractor. Today, aerospace and defense company relationships are moving more toward that of "partners" where the previous supplier or sub-contractor for hardware or software subsystems is now sharing in the overall system design and engineering efforts. (cont.) Since the partner companies and intra-company divisions are still geographically distributed throughout the United States, it is necessary for the aerospace and defense contractors to perform collaborative, distributed systems engineering (CDSE) over several geographical locations. Previous research has demonstrated that the design practices of distributed design teams differ from those of traditional. co-located teams. However. <b>many</b> <b>companies</b> <b>today</b> <b>are</b> performing CDSE using systems engineering (SE) processes and methods developed for traditional SE environments and are therefore encountering many issues. Successful SE practices are difficult to carry-out when performed by a traditional, co-located enterprise. The addition of geographic distribution and cross-company or intra-company collaboration in SE presents a myriad of social and technological challenges that necessitate new and different SE methods for success. Best practices for CDSE are currently unknown (or undocumented). In an attempt to benchmark the current state of CDSE practices in industry, this research presents the collection of CDSE lessons learned and success factors gathered from two case studies carried out at two United States aerospace and defense companies. (cont.) The case studies examine many different factors that pertain to the companies "current CDSE efforts, including collaboration scenarios: collaboration tools; knowledge and decision management; SE practices and processes; SE process improvements: SE culture: SE project management. SE organization: and SE collaboration benefits and motivation. Since the research for successful CDSE practices is in its infancy. this research also outlines key areas for future CDSE research. by Darlene Ann Utter. Thesis (S. M.)

However, this kind of data-driven approach is seldomly applied to software testing and there is often a lack of verification that the testing performed is relevant to how the system under test is used. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to investigate the possibility of introducing a data-driven approach to test automation by extracting user behaviour data and curating it to form input for testing. A prestudy was initially conducted in order to collect and assess different data sources for augmenting the testing. After suitable data sources were identified, the required data, including data about user activity in the system, was extracted. This data was then processed and three prototypes where built on top of this data. The first prototype augments the model-based testing by automatically creating models of the most common user behaviour by utilising data mining algorithms. The second prototype tests the most frequent occurring client actions. The last prototype visualises which features of the system are not covered by automated regression testing. The data extracted and analysed in this thesis facilitates the understanding of the behaviour of the users in the system under test. The three prototypes implemented with this data as their foundation can be used to assist other testing methods by visualising test coverage and executing regression tests...|$|R

Traditionally, management accounting is assumed to take place within an organization where the management of the company decides how to design the costing system based on the needs of the organization. However, <b>many</b> <b>companies</b> of <b>today</b> <b>are</b> involved in closer relationships with suppliers, buyers or an entire supply chain, which blurs the traditional boundaries between them. One of the key characteristics of such {{relationships is}} an extensive exchange of information for the coordination of the two parties. How the supplier’s product costing can support such cooperation is not dealt with to a large extent in the literature. This thesis describes, explores and to some extent explains the interorganizational use and design of the supplier’s product costing. Further, it explores the relationship between the supplier’s product costing and interorganizational cost management that normally is coordinated by the buyer. The empirical data is collected from three Swedish suppliers in the automotive industry. In short, the results of the thesis are: 15 different situations are identified where product costing and other types of cost data are used between the buyer and the supplier. The most important situations deal with the joint development of the product. The supplier’s product costing supports the interorganizational cost management {{in a number of different}} ways.

Mortgage Originators, although an established industry in most western countries {{is a relatively new}} concept to South Africa. The study investigates the initial phase of this new industry in comparison to the trends established in countries such as Australia and USA. As this new concept has resulted in financial institutions making drastic changes, it was imperative that {{the first part of the}} research concentrated on the theory of strategy. Recent developments in strategy were discussed with strategic models and the development of strategic planning. This formed the framework for the next discussion on international trends and the current South African mortgage origination situation. A comparison between the Australian, USA and South African markets show similar trends in the start-up phase of the mortgage origination industry. A gap analysis was conducted and the findings have led to recommendations to South African financial institutions on how deal with the new mortgage origination concept. The conclusion drawn from the study clearly show that some organisations have ample resources but lack aspirations, on the other hand there are organisations that are driven by high aspiration but have meagre resource bases. On the one hand, strategic intent envisions a desired leadership position and establishes the criterion the organisation will use to chart its progress. The concept also encompasses an active management process that includes focusing the organisations attention on the essence of winning; motivating people by communicating the value of the target; leaving room for individual and team contributions; sustaining enthusiasm by providing new operational definitions as circumstances change and using intent to consistently guide resource allocations.

The importance {{of the problem is}} supported by the fact, that last year more than eleven thousand economic entities in the Czech Republic became insolvent. The Set of Tools for Corporate Crisis Prevention shall help to better adjust the internal control mechanisms, using which businesses could better prevent crisis. Application of this Set of Tools for Corporate Crisis Prevention is verified based on two completely different companies. The dissertation addresses the question of how use standard tools such as loan and leasing for crisis prevention, possibly secure the recovery of growth opportunities. This support is implemented by using an external financial institution, or the Intercompany bank. In the chapter entitled "intercompany bank", I describe the basic principles of operation and its importance for internal control. This internal organization has been used in <b>many</b> <b>companies,</b> but <b>today</b> <b>is</b> back to support the sales department and help reduce risk associated with the greater indebtedness of the company. I am describing the Intercompany bank in the context of internal processes and forms of cooperation with the sales department. Functionality of the intercompany bank is supplemented with examples from practice. The chapter called "Micro-enterprise approach of the crisis" is complemented by the complexity of internal financial perspective to company's management. This chapter describes three main sources of the company crisis from a microeconomic perspective. It is decreasing demand, the impact of interest rate exchanges on corporate governance and the impact of exchange rate changes on the financial stability of the company. The analytical part of presented dissertation thesis deals with development of insolvency proposal, bankruptcy, and reorganization proposals in The Czech Republic between 2008 and 2013. The main target is finding the causal dependences between insolvency requirements in the Insolvency Register and a few key macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, unemployment rate, industrial production growth and the amount of loans granted to the corporate sector.
