5|$|The final death {{scene in}} Tenebrae – where Neal is accidentally impaled by a {{sculpture}} – is directly referenced in Kenneth Branagh's Hitchcockian <b>murder</b> <b>mystery</b> Dead Again (1991).

The subsequent moment, where Nicolodi screams repeatedly in the rain, was cited by Asia Argento (Nicolodi's daughter with Dario Argento) as the moment that inspired her to become an actress.|$|E

5|$|Theatre-style, or freeform, LARP is characterised by a {{focus on}} {{interaction}} between characters that are written by the gamemasters, not using simulated weapons for combat, and an eclectic approach to genre and setting. Events in this style typically only last a few hours and require relatively little preparation by players and are sometimes played at gaming conventions. Some <b>murder</b> <b>mystery</b> games where players are assigned characters and encouraged to roleplay freely also resemble theatre-style LARP.|$|E
5|$|While {{the central}} plot is a <b>murder</b> <b>mystery,</b> the initial idea {{was of a}} writer with PTSD who cannot write and is instead {{fronting}} for his blacklisted best friend. Throughout the series, Brubaker switched between first- and third-person narration because it allowed him to tell a broader story. He was also {{trying to create a}} layered story that would reward repeated reading, so he avoided extraneous details. When writing the scripts, Brubaker listened to music from the 1940s to stay in the right frame of mind.|$|E

David Graham, who appears as undercover agent Johnny, had starred in a 1957 episode of the TV series Martin Kane, Private Investigator that Anderson had directed. A number of the cast contributed to later Anderson productions: George Murcell (Diamond) provided the voices of Professor Popkiss and Masterspy in the first series of Supercar, while Graham voiced various characters in Stingray and Thunderbirds.|$|E

5|$|The {{series was}} {{proposed}} by Bruce McCulloch during a 2008 The Kids in the Hall comedy tour and {{developed by the}} ensemble into a dark-comedy <b>murder</b> <b>mystery,</b> a departure from their typical sketch comedy format.

While the members of The Kids in the Hall play all of the major adult characters, a number of other comedic actors appear in supporting roles, including Dan Redican, Colin Mochrie, Wayne Robson, Susan Kent and Mike Beaver.

5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, rumors spread that Dunder Mifflin is in serious financial trouble, so Michael Scott (Steve Carell) tries to distract the office by having everyone play a <b>murder</b> <b>mystery</b> game called Belles, Bourbon, and Bullets. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) uses the game as a way to ask out Erin (Ellie Kemper), but fears he may have asked out Erin's character, instead of Erin herself.|$|E
5|$|Parsons' newfound {{credentials}} and financial security {{gave him the}} opportunity to travel more widely throughout the U.S. as an ambassador for Aerojet, meeting with other rocket enthusiasts. In New York he met with Karl Germer, the head of the O.T.O. in North America and in Washington, D.C. he met Poet Laureate Joseph Auslander, donating some of Crowley's poetry books to the Library of Congress. He also became a regular at the Mañana Literary Society, which met in Laurel Canyon at the home of Parsons' friend Robert A. Heinlein and included science fiction writers including Cleve Cartmill, Jack Williamson, and Anthony Boucher. Among Parsons' favorite works of fiction was Williamson's Darker Than You Think, a novelette published in the fantasy magazine Unknown in 1940, which inspired his later occult workings. Boucher used Parsons as a partial basis for the character of Hugo Chantrelle in his <b>murder</b> <b>mystery</b> Rocket to the Morgue (1942).|$|E
5|$|Radioland Murders is a 1994 comedy mystery film {{directed}} by Mel Smith and co-written and produced by George Lucas.

The film tells the story of writer Roger Henderson trying to settle relationship issues with his wife while dealing with a whodunit <b>murder</b> <b>mystery</b> in a radio station.

5|$|Regarding A Song of Ice and Fire as his magnum opus, Martin {{is certain}} never to write {{anything}} {{on this scale}} again and would only return to this fictional universe {{in the context of}} stand-alone novels. He prefers to write stories about characters from other Ice and Fire periods of history such as his Tales of Dunk and Egg project, instead of continuing the series directly. A possible future side project is a prequel set during Aegon's conquest of Westeros. Martin said he would love to return to writing short stories, novellas, novelettes, and stand-alone novels from diverse genres such as science fiction, horror, fantasy, or even a <b>murder</b> <b>mystery.</b> However, he will see if his audience follows him after publishing his next project.|$|E
5|$|Tijori {{produced}} and played his only {{lead role in}} Gowariker-directed <b>murder</b> <b>mystery</b> Pehla Nasha (1993), alongside Pooja Bhatt and Raveena Tandon. Upon release, the film received poor reviews and failed at the box office. In the same year, he appeared as the antagonist in D Rama Naidu-directed Santaan. Tijori starred alongside Shah Rukh Khan in Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa and Anjaam (both 1994). The latter one {{is considered one of}} the most violent films in Bollywood. In 1995, he starred in another Mahesh Bhatt-directed film Naajayaz. Tijori played a supporting role in action drama Mrityudata (1997) which did not receive favourable reviews from critics. He portrayed supporting characters in Aamir Khan-starrer Ghulam (1998) and the Abbas-Mustan-directed comedy thriller Baadshah. In the latter, he featured as the titular undercover CBI agent.|$|E
5|$|During {{a reunion}} tour in summer 2008, The Kids in the Hall comedy troupe decided {{they would like}} to work {{together}} again. Since their 1996 movie Brain Candy, during which they had a falling out over creative differences, they had only worked together on live comedy tours and had not appeared on television together since the end of their show in 1995. Bruce McCulloch pitched a television story idea which {{the rest of the group}} liked. They spent a couple days together brainstorming and developing characters. The storyline resolved into a <b>murder</b> <b>mystery</b> miniseries – partly inspired by the British comedy series The League of Gentlemen. McCulloch described it as Corner Gas meets Twin Peaks. The format diverged from their typical sketch comedy style by following a continuous narrative – though side-stories explore characters further. Along with producer Susan Cavin in fall 2008, they pitched the concept to CBC executive Fred Fuchs who greenlit the project.|$|E
