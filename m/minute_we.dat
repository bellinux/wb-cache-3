500|$|For the exteriors of {{the capital}} city of King's Landing, that had been doubled for Malta for the entire season 1, now the {{production}} flew to the Croatian city of Dubrovnik. Known as The Pearl of the Adriatic, the city proved to be a good representation of King's Landing since it shared many characteristics with the fictional capital: it had a well-preserved medieval look, with high walls and the sea at its side. According to David Benioff, executive producer of the show, [...] "The <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> started walking around the city walls we knew that was it. You read the descriptions in the book and you come to Dubrovnik and that's what the actual city is. It has the sparkling sea, sun and beautiful architecture." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{priorities}} for Goldwyn was to shorten {{the length of the}} show to at least three hours or less. In view of his goal, he told reporters regarding winner's acceptance speeches, [...] "We are actually going to give them 45 seconds. The light (next to the camera) will start blinking at 45 seconds and go red at 55 seconds. After one <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> will either cut to a commercial or go to something else. We've also asked multiple winners to flip a coin and pick a spokesman." [...] Furthermore, instead of each Best Original Song nominee being performed separately, all five songs were performed as part of a musical number featuring actress Bernadette Peters singing brief introductions to each one. Although Goldwyn attempted to move the Documentary and Short Film Categories to a separate ceremony from the broadcast, the AMPAS Board of Governors refused to do so.|$|E
500|$|Orion {{was less}} {{resolute}} {{in terms of}} who they wanted for the role of Agent Alan Ward. After filming The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Willem Dafoe expressed interest in playing Ward, and Parker traveled to Los Angeles, where he met with the actor to discuss the role. Dafoe was cast shortly thereafter. To prepare for the role, Dafoe researched the time period and Neshoba County. He also read Willie Morris's 1983 novel The Courting of Marcus Dupree, and looked at 1960s documentary footage detailing how the media covered the murder case. Frances McDormand plays Mrs. Pell, the wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell. On working with Hackman, McDormand said, [...] "...in Mississippi Burning, I didn't do research. All I did was listen to [...] He had an amazing capacity for not giving away any part of himself (in read-throughs). But the <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> got on the set, little blinds on his eyes flipped up and everything was available. It was mesmerizing. He's really believable, and it was like a basic acting lesson." ...|$|E

5000|$|When we {{were making}} our third record, the War LP, we were being {{thrown out of the}} studio by the studio manager because we had overrun or {{something}} and we had one more song to do. We wrote this song in about ten <b>minutes,</b> <b>we</b> recorded it in about ten <b>minutes,</b> <b>we</b> mixed it in about ten <b>minutes</b> and <b>we</b> played it, then, for another ten minutes and that's nothing to do with why it's called '40'.

500|$|Rhys has a {{one-night stand}} with Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) not long after his introduction. Rhys meets Kate in the local bar {{and they have a}} [...] "big night out"; the {{following}} morning Kate wakes up in Rhys' apartment. Brewer told a writer for Inside Soap [...] "You don't actually see the lead-up– one minute she meets Rhys in a bar, the next <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> see that they've already slept together!" [...] Kate feels awkward about the situation, but it is made worse when she is unable to remember Rhys' name. When Kate and Rhys meet again, they have different attitudes to their one-night stand. Brewer said Rhys is [...] "a bit of a player", so it is not a big deal to him. He does not have any expectations of Kate, but she is uncomfortable with it and tries to cover her tracks. In November 2011, Brewer said {{it would be interesting to}} revisit the relationship between Rhys and Kate. Barber also thought it would be interesting to see where the characters could go together. The actor added that [...] "sparks fly" [...] when Rhys is around Kate, as he knows how to [...] "press her buttons".|$|E
2500|$|In 1960, Reynolds and Autry {{founded the}} Major League Baseball {{expansion}} team the Los Angeles Angels. [...] At {{the time that}} he and Autry received the franchise for the American League's new Los Angeles franchise, Reynolds described his transition to a [...] "baseball man" [...] and his long relationship with Autry:"'My transformation into the town's No. 1 baseball fan,' he grinned, 'occurred the <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> were given the franchise, and I found out I had a little personal investment at stake.' … 'I'd known Gene for at least 15 years, and we always hoped to own a radio station together,' explained Bob. [...] 'We satisfied that ambition with the acquisition of KMPC in 1952. NOw we have a baseball team, and we're out to make it the best.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Naughty Dog {{has said}} future titles {{will have to}} live up to a [...] "really high" [...] quality standard. Speaking to IGN, lead effects artist Keith Guerrette said success has made the studio [...] "a little bit reluctant, actually, if we do sit back and decide to {{continue}} with the Uncharted world, because we don't want to [...] "ruin" [...] the series." [...] According to Naughty Dog, {{it was a mistake to}} reveal Uncharted 3s release date a year out with the challenges involved with completing a game by its due date. [...] "We will never do that again, not a year out", sighed co-president Christophe Balestra during an interview with Eurogamer. [...] "The <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> saw the date on screen we were like, 'Oh God, I really regret that'", Evan Wells agreed.|$|E

60|$|In a few <b>minutes</b> <b>we</b> {{were both}} ready, {{and we went}} to Checco. We found him seated at a table {{polishing}} a dagger.|$|R
60|$|For a <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> both {{glared at}} one another, still growling. Then the man rose up to a {{standing}} position with a muttered exclamation of disgust.|$|E
