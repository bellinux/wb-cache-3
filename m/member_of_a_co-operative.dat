She played a fair game of bridge, and her card-room manners were irreproachable. But wherever she came in contact with her own sex the light of battle kindled at once; her talent of arousing animosity seemed to border on positive genius.|$|E

40|$|From a tax {{point of}} view, {{becoming}} a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>co-operative</b> has no consequences except {{the creation of}} a contractual link between the cooperative and its member to explain the payments that will be made between them. On the other hand, the cease to be a member is indeed regulated by tax law. We must study the tax consequences that arise when a member, who is an individual, leaves a co-operative. The leaving of the individual member means that equity will be transferred from the co-operative to the member as return of the contributions that the member made in its day. This return is subject to the Income Tax of Individuals. Secondly, the return received when the member leaves the co-operative might be subject to the Tax on Equity Transfers and Documented Legal Acts, in the Corporate Transactions modality, for the contributions returned to the member leaving the co-operative.

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>co-operative,</b> {{which is}} <b>a</b> {{voluntary}} and self-governing corporation, is organised and functions on democratic principles. One {{of the fundamental}} features of that democratic system {{is the fact that}} the role of the highest organ <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>co-operative</b> is vested in the general assembly <b>of</b> its <b>members.</b> The general assembly functions either directly, with participation <b>of</b> its all <b>members,</b> or indirectly, through their democratically elected representatives.

Therefore, their control over the co-operative is deeper and democratic. Accordingly, the management in <b>a</b> <b>co-operative</b> is subject to <b>a</b> complex system <b>of</b> democratic decision-making, which is why it is often found slow and cumbersome.

40|$|Coffee {{producers}} {{in many parts}} of the world have the option <b>of</b> either becoming <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> and selling their coffee to a Fairtrade and organic co-operative, or selling it to a ‘‘coyote’’, the Central American nickname for intermediary purchaser. This study investigates why different producers make different choices, looking at both material and immaterial costs and benefits of the two choices. A qualitative study from Chiapas (Mexico) finds that a main reason for not choosing the co-operatives is the production requirements that follow organic certification. A survey on production costs confirms that <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> organic <b>co-operative</b> have more work hours than nonmembers in the same area. A probit analysis indicates that both coffee plot size and number <b>of</b> working household <b>members</b> influence the producers’ decision on sales channel.

The chapter is organized around a question raised by <b>a</b> fellow <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the Centre: ‘what do we mean when we say “democracy”?’ I will explain both the importance and impossibility of answering this question, and consider how it opens up new understandings {{of the political and}} pedagogical conditions of radical informal learning spaces. I then consider what, if anything, is radical about this particular space, and how abandoning ‘the radical’ may heighten our receptivity to it. Finally, the chapter considers the role that non-community-based spaces of popular higher education can play in the proliferation of critical thinking, capacities for ‘commoning’ and the creation of democratic publics in contexts where individualism and class division presently prevail...|$|R
40|$|The {{expansion}} of sugarcane for biofuels {{is a highly}} contentious issue. The growth of sugarcane area has occurred simultaneously with <b>a</b> reduction <b>of</b> dairy production in São Paulo state, the primary production region for sugar and ethanol in Brazil. This paper analyses different dairy farm rationales to continue dairy production in the context <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dramatically expanding sugarcane economy. Combining different data sets – semi-structured interviews with 34 farmers and baseline data from all <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dairy farm <b>co-operative</b> – {{makes it possible to}} recognize different farm types. This heuristic tool is used to identify the various strategies regarding shifting to biofuel production or investing in dairy farming. The paper identifies labour availability, household resilience and technology introduction as key factors in the context of complex, multiple interactions between the biofuel sector and dairy production. We will argue that biofuel-sugarcane expansion not always pushes aside dairy farming. Those farmers that shift to sugarcane are not simply spurred by better prices, but mainly change as result of perceptions of labour constraints, risks and the opportunities offered by diversification. For farmers who totally quit dairy production the shift to sugarcane may pass the point of no return...|$|R
40|$|The Act of Sept. 16, 1932 on Co-operatives {{modified}} the system <b>of</b> organs <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>co-operative</b> only to <b>a</b> very limited extent. The general assembly retains {{the rank of}} the supreme organ <b>of</b> <b>a</b> co-operative; the function of current management and representation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>co-operative</b> is vested in the board. The task and competences {{in the area of}} control of over-all activity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>co-operative</b> have been vested in the supervisory council. The Act has also transferred to the council some powers in the sphere of management and representation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>co-operative.</b> The supervisory council is electively dependent on the general assembly since the latter is empowered to elect and remove the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the council. Only in co-operatives which adopted the representative system, i. e. replaced the general assembly with the meeting of representatives, the election and removal <b>of</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the council is vested either in the meeting of representatives or in the meetings of the members' groups. The instance dependence of the council on the general assembly manifests itself through examining by the supreme organ the appeals from the resolutions of the council. The Act provides also for the dependence of the council on the general assembly in the sphere of decision-making, i. e. it defines the instances of making the resolution of the council dependent on the prior opinion of the general assembly and on the conditions determined in the resolution of that organ. In relation to the board <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>co-operative,</b> the supervisory council performs the functions of supervision and control. The statute <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>co-operative</b> may also authorize the council to elect and remove the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the board. Performing the above functions by the council justifies the interdiction to combine the membership of that organ with the membership in the board. <b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> supervisory council do not receive any compensation for their services as such. The above does not exclude their liability for their actions towards the co-operative; by virtue of art. 58 of the Act on Co-operatives, their liability is based on art. 114 et seq. of the Labour Code. The position of the supervisory council in <b>a</b> <b>co-operative</b> allows that organ to perform independently the function of internal control according to the needs and requirements of the co-operative democracy.
