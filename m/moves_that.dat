5|$|Abilities are {{classified}} into action and support categories. Action abilities consume magic points (MP) and include magic spells and special <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> {{are used in}} battle. Support abilities provide functions that remain in effect indefinitely and must be equipped with magic stones to be functional. The maximum number of these stones increases as the characters level up.|$|E
5|$|A {{defining}} and best-known {{feature of the}} Mortal Kombat series is its finishing move system called Fatality. An original idea behind it was to give gamers a free hit {{at the end of}} the fight. The basic Fatalities are finishing <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> allow the victorious characters to end a match in a special way by murdering their defeated, defenseless opponents in a gruesome manner, usually in the predefined ways exclusive for the given character. The only exception from this is Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, which instead features the Kreate-A-Fatality, allowing the players to perform their own Fatalities by conducting a series of violent moves chosen from a pool that is common for all characters.|$|E
5|$|Alien Soldier is a side-scrolling run and gun {{video game}} {{developed}} by Treasure {{and published by}} Sega for the Mega Drive. Retail copies were released in Japan and PAL territories while in North America it was only available exclusively via the Sega Channel cable service. The story follows a powerful being named Epsilon-Eagle, who after being nearly killed becomes determined to avenge his near death and save his planet. The character {{has a variety of}} weapons and <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> the player must master to complete the game. Many gameplay ideas are borrowed from Treasure's earlier Mega Drive release, Gunstar Heroes (1993). However, Alien Soldier puts an emphasis on challenging boss fights with short and easy levels serving as downtime in-between.|$|E

I <b>move</b> <b>that</b> all votes, all votes cast by delegates {{be reflected in}} the official record, and I <b>move</b> <b>that</b> Hillary Clinton be selected as the nominee of the Democratic Party for president of the United States." [...] Clinton had made a similar motion during the 2008 convention roll call; however, Sanders (unlike Clinton in 2008) did not move to nominate Clinton by acclamation. Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.|$|R

5|$|Fighting {{games are}} {{a type of}} action game where two {{on-screen}} characters fight each other. These games typically feature special <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> are triggered using rapid sequences of carefully timed button presses and joystick movements. Games traditionally show fighters from a side-view, even as the genre has progressed from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) graphics. Street Fighter II, though not the first fighting game, popularized and standardized the conventions of the genre, and similar games released prior to Street Fighter II have since been more explicitly classified as fighting games. Fighting games typically involve hand-to-hand combat, but may also feature melee weapons.|$|E
5|$|Sonic and the Secret Rings is a 2007 {{platform}} {{video game}} developed by Sonic Team {{and published by}} Sega for the Wii. A spin-off to the Sonic the Hedgehog series, {{it is the first}} title in the franchise for the system, and follows Sonic the Hedgehog's quest to stop an evil genie named the Erazor Djinn. In addition to the basic platforming gameplay of previous Sonic titles, Secret Rings uses a system of experience points and levels, as well as special <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> are unlocked via leveling up.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{gameplay}} {{system of}} KOF '94 {{is similar to}} SNK's previous games like the Fatal Fury series, Art of Fighting and Samurai Shodown. The game uses a four attack button configuration similar to Fatal Fury 2 and Fatal Fury Special, that consists of light punch, light kick, strong punch and strong kick. Like in Fatal Fury 2, specialized techniques are performed by pressing buttons in combination, allowing the player to dodge an opponent's attack or to launch a character's powerful knockdown attack. As with most other fighting games, each character has a set of basic, unique, and special <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> can be performed by the player with a specific series of joystick and button inputs.|$|E

5|$|The main display map of {{the game}} is focused on Cyrenaica, a {{representation}} of the Allied minefield that was laid in the Gazala Line between Gazala and Bir Hachieim. The Axis troops begin the game on the western side of the line, whilst Allied forces begin the offensive in British Egypt. A command box in the game provides the player with an instant report of a unit or landscape once hovered over; data given on units includes their strength in terms of supply of infantry, provisions, artillery, and the number of <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> unit can make on one turn. Every two turns lasts one in-game day and units are available to enter combat phases once a day is finished.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{founded the}} field of game theory as a {{mathematical}} discipline. Von Neumann proved his minimax theorem in 1928. This theorem establishes that in zero-sum games with perfect information (i.e. in which players know at each time all <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> have taken place so far), there exists a pair of strategies for both players that allows each to minimize his maximum losses, hence the name minimax. When examining every possible strategy, a player must consider all the possible responses of his adversary. The player then plays out the strategy {{that will result in}} the minimization of his maximum loss.|$|E
5|$|With a few exceptions, adult {{amphibians}} are predators, {{feeding on}} virtually anything that <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> they can swallow. The diet mostly consists of small prey {{that do not}} move too fast such as beetles, caterpillars, earthworms and spiders. The sirens (Siren spp.) often ingest aquatic plant material with the invertebrates on which they feed and a Brazilian tree frog (Xenohyla truncata) includes a large quantity of fruit in its diet. The Mexican burrowing toad (Rhinophrynus dorsalis) has a specially adapted tongue for picking up ants and termites. It projects it with the tip foremost whereas other frogs flick out the rear part first, their tongues being hinged at the front.|$|E

5|$|Darryl Sutter {{engineered}} a seven player {{trade at}} the end of January that sent Dion Phaneuf and Fredrik Sjostrom to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for four players led by Matt Stajan, Ian White and Niklas Hagman. The deal ended weeks of speculation about the Calgary defenceman's future amid reports that Phaneuf had requested a trade – a claim he had denied. One day later, the Flames sent Olli Jokinen and Brandon Prust to the New York Rangers in exchange for Ales Kotalik and Chris Higgins. The deals resulted in the change of over one third of the roster in the period of a day, <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> were seen as a sign of panic as the Flames hovered around the final playoff spot. While rumours circulated that Phaneuf was dealt because he was a divisive influence in the locker room, Jokinen later blamed the fans in Calgary for the defenceman's departure. Jokinen admitted that he was traded because he failed to produce in Calgary, while in Kotalik, the Flames received a player who was having a similarly disappointing season in New York.|$|E
5|$|If the Council {{does make}} an adverse report, Parliament may amend {{the bill to}} rid it of any {{differentiating}} measures before sending {{it back to the}} Council for inspection. The MP having charge of the bill may give two clear days' notice of the amendments he or she proposes to move in Parliament to the provisions of the bill that were adversely reported upon by the Council. The bill then stands recommitted to a committee of the whole Parliament on those provisions, and the proposed amendments are considered. Parliament then resumes, and the MP having charge of the bill reports whether the amendments were agreed to by the committee. If so, the MP <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> the amended bill should be resubmitted to the Council. There is uncertainty as to whether the Council will have to make another report within any time limit, or if the bill will then be directly presented to the President for assent.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman Senate, Cato the Younger <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> Caesar be {{stripped}} of his command and recalled to Rome to answer charges of misusing his office and illegal warmongering. Pompey, as sole Consul present, vetoes the motion, insisting in trusting Caesar. At the theater that night, Scipio introduces his daughter Cornelia Metella to Pompey as a prospective wife, while Cato warns him that he must ally against Caesar {{before it is too}} late. Pompey again asserts that Caesar means no harm, although privately, he is troubled by Caesar's rising prestige and power and gives orders to one of his slaves who is leaving on a trip to Gaul. At night in the encampment of the 13th Legion, the Aquila (Eagle Standard) is stolen by brigands. To avoid a potentially disastrous drop in morale, Mark Antony orders Vorenus to retrieve it. As Vorenus feels the mission is doomed to failure, he has the condemned Pullo released from the stockade to assist him.|$|E

5|$|Most Pokémon {{evolve into}} other forms when certain {{conditions}} are met, {{such as when}} they reach a certain level—levels range from 1 to 100—or have a certain item used on them. They can learn up to four moves, including attacking moves, healing moves, and <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> inflict status conditions on the opponent. They have six stats that affect battle performance: maximum HP (hit points), Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Attack and Special Attack are distinguished from Defense and Special Defense by the types of moves being considered: generally, moves involving physical exertion are physical, while moves involving supernatural or elemental powers are special. Moves are classed as one of seventeen types, (Normal, Water, Grass, Fire, Electric, Ghost, Bug, Fighting, Ice, Steel, Rock, Poison, Psychic, Dark, Dragon, Ground, and Flying); Pokémon can {{have one or two}} types. Generally, most of a Pokémon's moves correspond to its typing. A Pokémon's type makes it vulnerable or resistant to others; for example, Fire-type Pokémon are weak to Water-type moves, while Grass-type moves do little damage to them and Electric-type moves do normal damage.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 2013, Morris {{signed with}} the Philadelphia 76ers. As the September 28 {{training}} camp date approached, Morris was expected to battle with Tony Wroten for the backup point guard position behind Michael Carter-Williams. When Carter-Williams missed games, it was Wroten who moved into the starting lineup. On November 16, 2013 he scored a NBA regular season career high 20 points along with 2 assists in a 13598-point loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. On November 20, 2013, he was waived by the 76ers as part of roster <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> included signing Elliot Williams and Lorenzo Brown and waiving Kwame Brown. In December, {{he was one of}} several guards to work out with the Memphis Grizzlies. That month, he was also considered by the Los Angeles Lakers when Kobe Bryant was injured since point guards Blake, Nash and Jordan Farmar were all injured. The Lakers, however, decided to sign Kendall Marshall who was averageing 19.4 points and 9.6 assists in the D-League at the time.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they all}} share the forest, {{relationships}} between different Clans are tense. They often come {{into conflict with}} one another, becoming aggressive if a cat from a neighboring Clan accidentally crosses a border. This rivalry can increase in times of deprivation, such as if one Clan is suffering from a shortage of prey but another is thriving. An attempt for one Clan to steal all of or part of another Clan's territory is not unusual. To prepare for this, cats in all Clans are taught battle moves {{in order to protect}} their territory. Each Clan has signature battle <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> are taught to them from an early age (6 months/moons old). Border fights are the most common source of battle (a cat intentionally or unwittingly steps into another Clan's territory), and are often short-lived and cause no real damage to either side. However, bigger and more brutal battles can occur; at this point, casualties are to be expected. Despite this rivalry, the Clans can also show concern for another's well being; the idea of one Clan being destroyed causes deep distress, and will prompt urgent action on behalf of all four Clans. On the night of every full moon, the Clans will meet at a designated spot in order to share stories and news in peace. This is known as a 'Gathering', and is the only time in which fighting is prohibited.|$|E

5|$|His son Charles I {{attempted}} to impose {{elements of the}} English religious settlement on his other kingdoms. Relations gradually deteriorated resulting in the Bishops' Wars (1637–40), ending in defeat for Charles and helping {{to bring about the}} War of Three Kingdoms. The Scots entered the war in England on the Parliamentary side, helping to turn the tide against the king's forces. In the Second and Third Civil Wars (1648–51) they took the side of Charles I and after his execution that of his son Charles II, leading to defeat, occupation by a parliamentary army under Oliver Cromwell and incorporation into the Commonwealth. The Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 saw the return of episcopacy and an increasingly absolutist regime, resulting in religious and political upheaval and rebellions. With the accession of the openly Catholic James VII, there was increasing disquiet among Protestants. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688–89, William of Orange and Mary, the daughter of James, were accepted as monarchs. Presbyterianism was reintroduced and limitations placed on monarchy. After severe economic dislocation in the 1690s there were <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> led to political union with England as the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. The deposed main hereditary line of the Stuarts became a focus for political discontent, known as Jacobitism, leading to a series of invasions and rebellions, but with the defeat of the last in 1745, Scotland entered a period of great political stability, economic and intellectual expansion.|$|E
