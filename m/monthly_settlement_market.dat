5000|$|Further Dior boutiques {{were opened}} in 1990 in upscale New York City, Los Angeles, and Tokyo {{shopping}} districts. The stake in LVMH rose again, to 46%. Another collection of watches named [...] "Bagheera" [...] - {{inspired by the}} round design of the [...] "Black Moon" [...] watches - was also released in 1990. Having fired the company's managing executive Beatrice Bongbault in December 1990, Arnault took up that position until September 1991, when he placed former Bon Marché president Phillipe Vindry at the post. In 1991, Christian Dior was listed on the spot market {{and then on the}} Paris Stock Exchange's <b>monthly</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>market,</b> and the perfume [...] "Dune" [...] was launched. Vindry dropped ready-to-wear prices by 10%. Still, a wool suit from Dior would come with a price label of USD 1,500. 1990 revenue for Dior was USD 129.3 million, with a net income of $22 million. Dior was now reorganized into three categories: 1) women's ready-to-wear, lingerie, and children's wear 2) accessories and jewelry 3) menswear. Licensees and franchised boutiques were starting to be reduced, to increase the company's control over brand product. Licensing was in fact reduced by nearly half because Arnault and Vindry opted [...] "for quality and exclusivity over quantity and accessibility." [...] Wholly company-owned boutiques now opened in Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Cannes, and Waikiki, adding to its core stores located in New York City, Hawaii, Paris and Geneva. This held a potential to increase direct sales and profit margins while maintaining high-profile locations." [...] In 1992, Dior Homme was placed under the artistic direction of Patrick Lavoix, and the [...] "Miss Dior" [...] perfume was relaunched. Francois Baufume succeeded Vindry in 1993 and continued to reduce licenses of the Dior name.The production of Dior Haute Couture was spun off into a subsidiary named Christian Dior Couture in 1995. Also, the [...] "La Parisienne" [...] watch model was released - embodied in the watch [...] "Parisian Chic". By that year, revenue for the label rose to USD 177 million, with a net income of USD 26.9 million. Under the influence of Anna Wintour, editor and chief of Vogue, CEO Arnault appointed British designer John Galliano to replace Gianfranco Ferré in 1997 (Galliano on CBS News: [...] "without Anna Wintour I would certainly not be at the house of Dior"). This choice of a British designer, once again instead of a French one, is said to have [...] "ruffled some French feathers". Arnault himself stated that he [...] "would have preferred a Frenchman", but that [...] "talent has no nationality". He even compared Galliano to Christian Dior himself, noting that [...] "Galliano has a creative talent very close to that of Christian Dior. He has the same extraordinary mixture of romanticism, feminism, and modernity that symbolised Monsieur Dior. In all of his creations - his suits, his dresses - one finds similarities to the Dior style." [...] Galliano sparked further interest in Dior with somewhat controversial fashion shows, such as [...] "Homeless Show" [...] (models dressed in newspapers and paper bags) or [...] "S&M Show". Meanwhile, Dior licenses were being reduced further by new president and CEO Sidney Toledano. On 15 October 1997, the Dior headquarters store on Avenue Montaigne was reopened -it had been closed and remodeled by Peter Marino - in a celebrity-studded event including Nicole Kidman, Demi Moore and Jacques Chirac. That year, Christian Dior Couture also took over all thirteen boutique franchises from Japan's Kanebo.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> of life insurance policies on the monopolistic insurer's profit and social welfare. We assume that consumers differ only in their liquidity needs, and that the insurer cannot discriminate consumers based on their liquidity needs. When the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> incurs no costs, we find that the existence of the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> enhances social welfare. The welfare improvement comes not only from the saved costs, but also from the increased consumer bases. When the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> incurs costs, the results are complicated. Interestingly, social welfare can be improved, even if the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> is inefficient. However, {{it is also possible that}} social welfare is lowered even if the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> is efficient. The bottom line is that the introduction of a <b>settlement</b> <b>market,</b> regardless of its efficiency, changes the benefits and costs to the insurer's pricing strategy. Since the insurer does not fully internalize the consumer welfare, the profit maximizing strategy may fail to maximize the social welfare. Finally, the life <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> is active as long as it is more efficient, regardless of its impact on social welfare...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of life <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> on the {{structure}} of the long-term contracts o¤ered by the primary insurance market, {{as well as on the}} consumer welfare in a dynamic model of insurance with one-sided commitment as in Hendel and Lizzeri (2003) and Daily, Hendel and Lizzeri (2008). We show that the presence of the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> a¤ects the extent as well as the form of dynamic reclassification risk insurance in the equilibrium of the primary insurance market; and that the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> generally leads to lower consumer welfare. In the most extreme form, the presence of the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> can completely unravel the dynamic contracts to a sequence of spot short-term contracts. We also examine the primary insurers’ response to the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> when they can offer enriched contracts by specifying optimally chosen cash surrender values (CSVs). We show that the option of specifying CSVs is a useless option when there is no settlement firms; but facing the threat from the settlement firms, contracts with optimally chosen health-contingent CSVs will emerge in the equilibrium of the primary market, and such contracts improve consumer welfare, even though consumer welfare is still lower than that without the secondary market. In contrast, the option to endogenously specify non-health contingent CSVs is useless for the primary insurers...|$|R

Applying the results of my analysis to the logic of a classic adverse selection model, I develop and implement a test of adverse selection in the viatical <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> using nationally representative data on viatical transactions. Additionally, I extract a new prediction from the consumer behavior model relating the probability of selling life insurance to both the policy’s face value and the policyholder’s mortality risk, and I test this prediction against data on HIV+ individuals.

40|$|Abstract: We {{analyze the}} effects of life {{insurance}} settlement on the insurer’s profit and the consumer and social welfare. We consider a one-period model in which the insurance market is monopolistic and the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> is competitive. Policyholders face heterogeneous liquidity risks in addition to mortality risks. Liquidity risks are introduced to address the case in which policyholders need urgent cash, leading them to surrender or settle the policies. It is assumed that the insurer cannot observe the liquidity risks nor discriminate among policyholders based on liquidity risk. It is further assumed that no costs are incurred in policy surrender or settlement. We find that introduction of the life <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> lowers monopolistic rent and insurer’s profit, and raises the insurance premium. The effects on consumer welfare and social welfare are mixed. Consumer welfare increases only when demand increases sufficiently. This finding implies that social welfare, {{as measured by the}} sum of consumer welfare and the insurer's profit, can increase if the increase in consumer welfare is greater than the decrease in insurer's profit. This finding contrasts with the existing literature, in which the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> lowers consumer and social welfare...|$|R

Insurance product design, market intermediation, regulation, tax legislation, investment markets, investor rationale and more are explored through in-depth interviews with a range of industry experts.

Across some dimensions the South African primary market may be even more conducive to life settlement transactions than the US.

40|$|The {{paper offers}} an {{explanation}} for the evolution and increasing maturity of the life <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> and the implications for all longevity based financial instruments and products by exploring the market dynamics and asset valuation processes. The paper begins by revisiting the brief history of the life <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> before examining the market’s evolution, finding that the increased participation in this multi-stage market has driven innovation, leading to the commoditization of various services and products which forces present service providers to either withdraw or adopt one of the operational marketing models, and lowers the barriers to entry for revolutionary service and product development. The paper then examines the value that the life settlement asset provides to both parties and establishes how that value is assessed. The paper finds that for impaired lives and specific other policies the settlement value is significantly greater than the surrender value, and that the calculation of worth to both buyer and seller must calculate both financial value and utilization value; the seller gains utilization from releasing liquidity, the buyer fro...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{economic}} model {{that allows a}} terminally ill policy-holder {{to decide whether or}} not to sell (part of) the policy in the viatical <b>settlement</b> <b>market.</b> The viatical <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> emerged in the late 1980 s in response to the AIDS epidemic. Nowadays it is part of the large US <b>market</b> in life <b>settlements.</b> The policies traded in the viatical market are those of terminally ill policyholders expected to die within the next two years. The model is discrete and considers only the next two periods (years), since this is the max- imum remaining lifetime of the policyholder. The decisor has an initial wealth and has to share it between his own consumption and the bequests left to his heirs. We rst introduce the expected utility function of our decisor and then use dynamic programming to deduce the strategy that gives higher utility (not selling/selling (part of) the policy at time zero/selling (part of) the policy at time one). The optima depends on the value of the viaticated policy and on some personal parameters of the individual. We nd an analitical expression for the optimal strategy and perform a sensitivity analysis. expected utility, viatical settlement, dynamic programming...|$|R

The return reversals are stronger in countries where the mutual fund ownership is large, and in the US they have become stronger over time as the mutual fund ownership of stocks has increased. Using data that contains all trades of a subset of institutional investors, we show direct evidence that institutional trading contributes to the market reversals.
