40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{reported}} that low-viscous and fermentable dietary fiber and nondigestible oligosaccharides enhance mineral absorption. Resistant <b>maltodextrin,</b> nonviscous, fermentable and soluble source of dietary fiber, has several physiological functions. However, influence of resistant <b>maltodextrin</b> on mineral absorption is unclear. Aim of the study: We conducted balance studies in rats to investigate effects of resistant <b>maltodextrin</b> and hydrogenated resistant <b>maltodextrin</b> on apparent mineral absorption. Methods: In experiment 1 (Exp. 1), 40 rats were fed test diets based on AIN- 93 G with or without resistant <b>maltodextrin</b> or hydrogenated resistant <b>maltodextrin</b> for 2 weeks. In experiment 2 (Exp. 2), 32 rats were cecectomized (CX) or sham-operated (Sham) and fed diets with or without hydrogenated resistant <b>maltodextrin</b> for 1 week. Results: In Exp. 1, ingestion of resistant <b>maltodextrin</b> and hydrogenated resistant <b>maltodextrin</b> dose-dependently enhanced apparent absorption rates of Ca, Mg, Fe and Zn, and increased cecal fermentation with cecal expansion. In Exp. 2, the absorption rates of Ca and Mg were significantly enhanced by ingestion of hydrogenated resistant <b>maltodextrin</b> in Sham group but not in CX group. The promotion of Fe and Zn absorption was not affected by cecectomy. Conclusion: Ingestion of resistant <b>maltodextrin</b> and hydrogenated resistant <b>maltodextrin</b> increased apparent Ca and Mg absorptions dependent on cecal fermentation, while other mechanisms may also be involved in promotion of apparent Fe and Zn absorption by resistant <b>maltodextrin...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to extend the functionality of <b>maltodextrin</b> in foods, by forming maltodextrin-surfactant complexes that had novel properties not exhibited by <b>maltodextrin</b> alone. To achieve this objective it was necessary to understand the molecular origin and characteristics of maltodextrin-surfactant interactions. A variety of analytical techniques were therefore used to characterize maltodextrin-surfactant interactions. ^ Initial experiments using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and surface tensiometry showed that an anionic surfactant (SDS) bound to <b>maltodextrin</b> when the surfactant concentration exceeded a critical value (∼ 0. 05 mM). ITC showed that the interaction of SDS to <b>maltodextrin</b> was exothermic, which could have been due to an exothermic coil-helix transition and/or an exothermic binding reaction. Surfactant binding to <b>maltodextrin</b> only occurred when the number of monomers in the <b>maltodextrin</b> chain exceeded ∼ 24 glucose units. NMR studies showed that the interaction involved carbons 1 and 4 of the D-glucopyranose residues of <b>maltodextrin</b> and the surfactant hydrophobic tail, which suggested the formation of a helical inclusion complex. ^ The effect of surfactant type on maltodextrin-surfactant interactions was also investigated. ITC, surface tension and ultrasonic measurements indicated that the charge on the surfactant head group influenced their binding to <b>maltodextrin.</b> Similar amounts of anionic and cationic surfactant bound to <b>maltodextrin,</b> but a much smaller amount of non-ionic surfactant bound. The ITC indicated that surfactants with longer tail groups bound more strongly to <b>maltodextrin</b> than surfactants with shorter ones. ^ The effect of temperature, pH, and salt concentration on maltodextrin-surfactant interactions was studied using ITC. This study indicated that the enthalpy changes associated with surfactant demicellization were highly temperature-dependent. In contrast, the binding of surfactants to <b>maltodextrin</b> was exothermic and relatively temperature-independent. There was no effect of pH on the binding of surfactant to <b>maltodextrin.</b> In contrast, salt concentration affected both surfactant demicellization and surfactant binding to <b>maltodextrin.</b> ^ A potential application of maltodextrin-surfactant complexes was demonstrated by studying the rheology and thermal behavior of <b>maltodextrin</b> solutions in the presence and absence of SDS. The rheology and thermal properties of <b>maltodextrin</b> solutions changed significantly when surfactant was added, e. g. the viscosity increased, gelation occurred, and a melting transition was observed. ...|$|R

Results Distinct from common secondary energy sources (e. g., phosphoenolpyruvate – PEP, glucose- 6 -phosphate), <b>maltodextrin</b> was used for energizing CFPS through substrate phosphorylation and the glycolytic pathway because (i) <b>maltodextrin</b> can be slowly catabolized by <b>maltodextrin</b> phosphorylase for continuous ATP regeneration, (ii) <b>maltodextrin</b> phosphorylation can recycle one phosphate per reaction for glucose- 1 -phosphate generation, and (iii) the <b>maltodextrin</b> chain-shortening reaction can produce one ATP per glucose equivalent more than glucose can.
