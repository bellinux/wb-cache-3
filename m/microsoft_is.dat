5|$|On December 7, 2016, Microsoft {{announced}} that {{as part of}} a partnership with Qualcomm, it planned to introduce support for running Win32 software on ARM architecture with a 32-bit x86 processor emulator, in 2017. Terry Myerson stated that this move would enable the production of Qualcomm Snapdragon-based Windows devices with cellular connectivity and improved power efficiency over Intel-compatible devices, and still capable of running the majority of existing Windows software (unlike the previous Windows RT, which was restricted to Windows Store apps). <b>Microsoft</b> <b>is</b> initially targeting this project towards laptops.|$|E
5|$|<b>Microsoft</b> <b>is</b> an American public {{multinational}} corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington, USA that develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports {{a wide range}} of products and services predominantly related to computing through its various product divisions. Established on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800, Microsoft rose to dominate the home computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems. Microsoft would also come to dominate the office suite market with Microsoft Office. The company has diversified in recent years into the video game industry with the Xbox, the Xbox 360, and the Xbox One, as well as into the consumer electronics and digital services market with Zune, MSN and the Windows Phone OS.|$|E

Arial, popularized by <b>Microsoft,</b> <b>is</b> a common Helvetica substitute. Other fonts such as Futura, Gill Sans, Univers and Frutiger have also remained popular over many decades.|$|E
25|$|In October 2011, {{users of}} Xbox Live {{reported}} having unauthorized {{access to their}} Xbox Live accounts, with Microsoft points subsequently being used and/or bought to purchase various in-game items for FIFA 12. <b>Microsoft</b> <b>is</b> responding to such incidents by restricting access to the account for 25 days whilst the fraud team investigates. Both EA and Microsoft have denied {{that there is a}} problem with security.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft Product Activation {{has also}} been criticized on {{multiple}} occasions for violating patent law. In 2006, <b>Microsoft</b> <b>was</b> required to pay $142 million to z4 Technologies for infringing on a product activation patent, while in 2009 <b>Microsoft</b> <b>was</b> ordered to pay $388 million to Uniloc for patent infringement in product activation in Windows XP, Office XP and Windows Server 2003.|$|R

5000|$|... 24/7 Media was {{acquired}} in 2007 by WPP at $11.75 a share, a turnaround {{from the low}} of 39 cents a share in 2003. Journal The Economist reported that WPP acquisition of 24/7 Media was a reaction to Google acquiring 24/7's main rival DoubleClick. <b>Microsoft</b> <b>was</b> a contender to buy 24/7 Media at the time. A year later in 2008 <b>Microsoft</b> <b>was</b> still interested.|$|R
25|$|Translucent: The {{new media}} is still {{justified}} {{in terms of}} the old and seeks to remain faithful to the older medium's character. This form of remediation seeks “to emphasize the difference rather than erase it” (P. 46). In translucent remediation “the new medium does not want to efface itself entirely” (p.46). For instance, in regards to the CD-ROM encyclopedia Encarta, <b>Microsoft</b> <b>is</b> attempting to convey to the consumer that, “she has purchased not simply an Encyclopedia, but an electronic, and therefore improved, Encyclopedia” (p.46).|$|E
25|$|The new Phishing Filter offers {{protection}} against phishing scams and other websites {{that may be}} considered dangerous for a user to enter their personal information into. When enabled, every website the user visits is checked against a master list of known phishing sites. If a site is listed, the user is informed. In light of the privacy implications of this feature, it is not enabled automatically; the user is asked when they start Internet Explorer 7 if they want it enabled. <b>Microsoft</b> <b>is</b> working in conjunction with companies that specialize in identifying phishing schemes to ensure the list of known sites is accurate and quickly updated.|$|E
500|$|<b>Microsoft</b> <b>is</b> {{leading the}} {{development}} of the open-source reference C# compiler and set of tools, previously codenamed [...] "Roslyn". The compiler, which is entirely written in managed code (C#), has been opened up and functionality surfaced as APIs. It is thus enabling developers to create refactoring and diagnostics tools. While other implementations of C# exist, Visual C# is by far the one most commonly used.|$|E

500|$|Developer Oskari Häkkinen {{has stated}} {{that there is a}} {{possibility}} for Alan Wake 2, as the first title is only [...] "Season 1" [...] and the DLC will [...] "bridge the gap to what we're working towards." [...] However Häkkinen added that the idea is currently in 'limbo' while <b>Microsoft</b> <b>is</b> focusing on downloadable content for the first game. Writer Mikko Rautalahti adds the story is [...] "bigger than one game" [...] and the sequel would be [...] "weird and wonderful".|$|E
500|$|Microsoft's E3 {{press conference}} on June 10, 2013, was also criticized for {{focusing}} too much on games that, beyond increased graphical capabilities, provided experiences that were otherwise similar to previous-generation games—giving little incentive for buying the new console. After Sony's E3 press conference later that evening, GameSpot editor Tom Mcshea {{went on to say}} that Microsoft had become anti-consumerist, trying to [...] "punish their loyal customers" [...] with strict restrictions, and that [...] "by saying no to the used game restrictions and always-online that <b>Microsoft</b> <b>is</b> so happily implementing on the Xbox One, Sony has elevated the PlayStation 4 as the console to grab this holiday season." [...] Rafi Mohammed, author of [...] "The Art of Pricing", felt that Microsoft priced Xbox One [...] "too high" [...] and that the $100 premium over its competitor could [...] "derail" [...] the system during the 2013 holiday season.|$|E
500|$|Rock Paper Shotgun writer Alec Meer {{argued that}} Microsoft's intent for this data {{collection}} lacked transparency, stating that [...] "there is no {{world in which}} 45pages of policy documents and opt-out settings split across 13different settings screens and an external website constitutes 'real transparency'." [...] ExtremeTech pointed out that, while previously scroogling against Google for similar data collection strategies, Microsoft now hoovers up your data {{in ways that would}} make Google jealous." [...] However, it was also pointed out that the requirement for such vast usage of customer data had become a norm, citing the increased reliance on cloud computing and other forms of external processing, as well as similar data collection requirements for services on mobile devices such as Google Now and Siri. In August 2015, Russian politician Nikolai Levichev called for Windows10 to be banned from use within the Russian government, as it sends user data to servers in the United States. The country had passed a federal law requiring all online services to store the data of Russian users on servers within the country by September 2016, or be blocked. Writing for ZDNet, Ed Bott said that the lack of complaints by businesses about privacy in Windows10 indicated [...] "how utterly normal those privacy terms are in 2015." [...] In a Computerworld editorial, Preston Gralla stated that [...] "the kind of information Windows10 gathers is no different from what other operating systems gather. But <b>Microsoft</b> <b>is</b> held to a different standard than other companies." ...|$|E

50|$|The DLL {{overwriting}} problem (referred to as DLL Stomping by <b>Microsoft)</b> <b>was</b> somewhat reduced with Windows File Protection (WFP) {{which was}} introduced in Windows 2000. This prevents unauthorized applications from overwriting system DLLs, unless they use the specific Windows APIs that permit this. There may still be a risk that updates from <b>Microsoft</b> <b>are</b> incompatible with existing applications, but this risk is typically reduced in current versions of Windows {{through the use of}} side-by-side assemblies.|$|R
2500|$|... <b>Microsoft</b> <b>is</b> market-dominant in the IBM PC-compatible {{operating}} system {{market and the}} office software suite market, although it has lost {{the majority of the}} overall {{operating system}} market to Android. The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops and servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure) and software development (Visual Studio).|$|E
2500|$|Coupland's {{research}} {{turned up}} {{links to the}} themes of Life After God. [...] "What surprised me about <b>Microsoft</b> <b>is</b> {{that no one has}} any conception of an afterlife. There is so little thought given to eternal issues that their very absence make them pointedly there. These people are so locked into the world, by default some sort of transcendence is located elsewhere, and obviously machines become the totem they imbue with sacred properties, wishes, hopes, goals, desires, dreams. That sounds like 1940s SF, but it's become the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{architecture}} of Windows NT, {{a line of}} operating systems produced and sold by <b>Microsoft,</b> <b>is</b> a layered design that consists of two main components, user mode and kernel mode. [...] It is a preemptive, reentrant operating system, which {{has been designed to}} work with uniprocessor and symmetrical multi processor (SMP)-based computers. To process input/output (I/O) requests, they use packet-driven I/O, which utilizes I/O request packets (IRPs) and asynchronous I/O. Starting with Windows 2000, Microsoft began making 64-bit versions of Windows available; before this, these operating systems only [...] existed in 32-bit versions.|$|E

2500|$|Microsoft {{plans to}} {{completely}} replace DirectShow gradually with Media Foundation in future Windows versions. One reason cited by <b>Microsoft</b> <b>is</b> to provide [...] "much more robust support for content protection systems" [...] (see digital rights management). Microsoft's MSFT Becky Weiss also confirms that [...] "you'll notice that {{working with the}} Media Foundation requires you {{to work at a}} slightly lower level than working with DirectShow would have. [...] And there are still DirectShow features that aren't (yet) in Media Foundation". As described in the Media Foundation article, Windows Vista and Windows 7 applications use Media Foundation instead of DirectShow for several media related tasks.|$|E
2500|$|On January 31, 2006, Microsoft {{released}} a public preview build (Beta 2 preview: Pre-Beta 2 version) of Internet Explorer 7 for Windows XP Service Pack 2 (not for Windows Server 2003 SP1) on their web site. It stated that more public preview builds (possibly Beta 2 in April) of Internet Explorer 7 {{will be released}} in first half of 2006, and final version will be released in second half of 2006. The pre beta build was refreshed on March 20, 2006 to build 7.0.5335.5. A real Beta 2 Build was released on April 24, 2006 to build 7.0.5346.5. In addition, at the MIX'06 conference, Bill Gates said that <b>Microsoft</b> <b>is</b> already working [...] on the next two versions of IE after version 7.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Microsoft</b> <b>is</b> {{an outspoken}} {{opponent}} of the cap on H1B visas, which allow companies in the U.S. to employ certain foreign workers. Bill Gates claims the cap on H1B visas {{makes it difficult to}} hire employees for the company, stating [...] "I'd certainly get rid of the H1B cap" [...] in 2005. Critics of H1B visas argue that relaxing the limits would result in increased unemployment for U.S. citizens due to H1B workers working for lower salaries. The Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, a report of how progressive the organization deems company policies towards LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual) employees, rated Microsoft as 87% from 2002 to 2004 and as 100% from 2005 to 2010 after they allowed gender expression.|$|E
