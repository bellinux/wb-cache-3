30|$|In {{order to}} deal with cross-layer message {{translation}} and generate CCL message translators, it is essential to have a good knowledge and understanding of the various <b>message</b> <b>syntaxes</b> encountered in middleware technologies as well as the issues that can rise when composing heterogeneous message translators. In general, a message translator assures two functions: (i) parsing a stream of bits or characters, representing a network message in order to produce an AST, and (ii) processing an AST to produce a network message in the format expected by a given component. Most existing approaches focus on the parsing problem, which is, in the general case, the hardest. In this section, we present and analyse existing approches for generating and composing message translators.|$|R

Hardware platforms considered are the Intel iPSC/ 860 and Paragon XP/S- 15, and clusters of SGI workstations on ethernet, communicating through PVM. It is found that the multi-partitioning strategy offers the kind of coarse granularity that allows scaling up to hundreds of processors on a massively parallel machine.

40|$|An {{important}} {{question in the}} study of language production {{is the nature of the}} semantic information that speakers use to create syntactic structures. A common answer to this question assumes that thematic roles help to mediate the mapping from <b>messages</b> to <b>syntax.</b> However, research using structural priming has suggested that the construction of syntactic frames may be insensitive to variations in thematic roles within messages (Cognition 35 (1990) 1; Psychological Review 99 (1992) 150). Because these studies involved structural alternations whose syntax covaries with the order of thematic roles, it is difficult to assess any independent contribution that role information may make to the positioning of phrases. In this study, we primed the order of the roles without changing the syntactic structure of the sentences produced, and found that the order of the roles was influenced by the priming manipulation. This implies that thematic roles or the features that differentiate them are active within the mapping between messages and sentence structures...|$|R

40|$|This conference {{paper was}} {{published}} in the book, 19 th European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering [© Elsevier]: [URL] VIRTHUALIS project aims to develop a number of virtual reality applications for improving safety in the process industries. The applications allow human factors experts to study how operators interact with plant, and provide a safe environment in which new safety actions can be tried and tested. Safety applications are built on the SafeVR technology platform, a distributed client-server virtual reality system. This paper describes how two external modules - a process simulator and a rule-based system - are interfaced to the platform and the benefits they provide both separately and together. The two modules communicate with the platform’s server by exchanging messages, conforming to a simple syntax. pSimProxy provides a generic interface to an external process simulator, which in turn delivers the realistic plant behaviour. It handles bidirectional data exchange with and control of the external simulator. It can be configured at run time to use whichever available mechanisms are supported by the actual process simulator that models the plant being simulated. ClipsClient is an expert or rule-based system, based on NASA’s CLIPS expert system software that can make inferences about the information contained in the messages. It consists of a set of facts, a number of rules and an inference engine. It can be provided with a number of rules that monitor how operators are running the plant, and react in useful ways to these events. The simulator notifies the server of changes in process parameters through a message. The values may be displayed, for example as gauge readings, in the virtual environment. As operators control the plant, their actions, say opening a valve, are also reported by messages via the server to the process simulation. Messages can also be read by the rule-based system, allowing it to maintain its own representation of the plant. This in turn permits automated expert reasoning {{on the state of the}} plant and the actions of its operators which can cause further message to be sent to the server. The rule-based system is therefore, a powerful mechanism for rapidly reconfiguring the application and general rules can be written that only require new facts at run-time to change the behaviour of the entire virtual environment. The <b>message</b> <b>syntaxes,</b> the system architecture and the interfacing of the external modules are described along with examples showing their individual and joint benefits...|$|R

In this paper we introduce a model to formally describe the protocols that underly these services, their security properties and the rewriting attacks they might be subject to. Unlike with usual security protocols, {{we have to address}} here the facts that: (1) The Web service receive/send actions are nondeterministic to accommodate the XML format and the lack of normalization in parsing XML messages. Our model is designed to permit non-deterministic operations. (2) The Web service message format is better modelled with multiset constructors than with fixed arity symbols. Hence we had to introduce an attacker model that handles associativecommutative operators. In particular we present a decision procedure for insecurity of Web services with messages built using encryption, signature, and other cryptographic primitives...|$|R

Then to detect the attacks {{we have to consider}} the services as combining multiset operators and cryptographic ones and we have to solve specific satisfiability problems in the combined theory.
