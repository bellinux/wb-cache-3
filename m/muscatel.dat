25|$|California {{sparkling}} wine traces its roots to Sonoma in the 1880s with {{the founding of}} Korbel Champagne Cellars. The Korbel brothers made {{sparkling wine}} according to the méthode champenoise from Riesling, Chasselas, <b>Muscatel</b> and Traminer. Today most California sparkling wine is largely made from the same grapes used in Champagne, Chardonnay, Pinot noir and some Pinot Meunier. Some wineries will also use Pinot blanc, Chenin blanc and French Colombard. The premium quality producers still use the méthode champenoise (or traditional method) while some low cost producers, like Gallo's Andre brand or Constellation Brands' Cook's, will use the Charmat method.|$|E
25|$|Sparkling wines {{produced}} in the United States {{can be made in}} both the méthode champenoise and the charmat method. Lower cost sparkling wines, such as André, Cook's, and Tott's, often employ the latter method with more premium sparkling wines utilizing the former. The history of producing quality sparkling wine in California {{can be traced to the}} Russian River Valley of Sonoma County where, in 1892, the Korbel brothers (emigrated from Bohemia in 1852) began producing sparkling wine according to the méthode champenoise. The first wines produced were made from Riesling, <b>Muscatel,</b> Traminer and Chasselas grapes. Partly aided by the foreign influence, the overall quality of Californian sparkling wine increased with the introduction of the more traditional sparkling wine grapes of Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Pinot Meunier and Pinot blanc into the production. US AVA requirements and wine laws do not regulate the sugar levels and sweetness of wine though most producers tend to follow European standards with Brut wine having less than 1.5% sugar up to Doux having more than 5%. As the sparkling wine industry in California grew, foreign investments from some of the Champagne region's most noted Champagne houses came to set up wineries in the area. These include Moët et Chandon's , Louis Roederer's Roederer Estate, and Taittinger's Domaine Carneros.|$|E

There were hothouses in operation by 1870, and produce from the site was shown in exhibits from 1871. At maximum extent in the late 19th century it had its own dairy and large numbers of glasshouses and hothouses. At {{the time it was}} the largest nursery in the southern hemisphere. Newman renamed it in 1875 to 'Newman's Model Nursery', probably for promotional purposes. In 1889 plant stocks included over 100,000 orange trees, the same number of mostly <b>muscatel</b> grape vines and 500,000 other fruit trees. It grew 300 varieties of orchids, 350 of chrysanthemums and 700 of roses. The nursery was a frequent prize winner at agricultural fairs and exhibitions.

Charles Newman died in 1889 after falling from his horse, and control of the nursery passed to his sixth son, Frederick.|$|E

6000|$|It {{is curious}} {{that the first}} measure of {{commercial}} policy in this session {{should have been a}} measure of protection {{in the shape of a}} bill introduced by the board of trade, imposing a duty on corn, wheat, and flour brought from the United States into Canada.[156] But this was only a detail, though a singular one, in a policy that was in fact a continuance of the relaxation of the commercial system of the colonies which had been begun in 1822 and 1825 by Robinson and Huskisson. In his present employment Mr. Gladstone was called upon to handle a mass of questions that were both of extreme complexity in themselves, and also involved collision with trade interests always easily alarmed, irritated, and even exasperated. With merchants and manufacturers, importers and exporters, brokers and bankers, with all the serried hosts of British trade, with the laws and circumstances of international commerce, he was every day brought into close, detailed, and responsible contact:--Whether the duty on straw bonnets should go by weight or by number; what was the difference between boot-fronts at six shillings per dozen pairs and a 15 per cent. duty ad valorem; how to distinguish the regulus of tin from mere ore, and how to fix the duty on copper ore so as not to injure the smelter; how to find an adjustment between the liquorice manufacturers of London and the liquorice growers of Pontefract; what was the special case for <b>muscatels</b> as distinct from other raisins; whether 110 pounds of ship biscuits would be a fair deposit for taking out of bond 100 pounds of wheat if not kiln-dried, or 96 pounds if kiln-dried; whether there ought to be uniformity between hides and skins. He applies to Cornewall Lewis, then a poor-law commissioner, not on the astronomy of the ancients or the truth of early Roman history, but to find out for a certain series of years past the contract price of meat in workhouses. He listens to the grievances of the lath-renders; of the coopers who complain that casks will come in too cheap; of the coal-whippers, and the frame-work knitters; and he examines the hard predicament of the sawyers, who hold government answerable both for the fatal competition of machinery and the displacement of wood by iron. 'These deputations,' he says, 'were invaluable to me, for by constant close questioning I learned the nature of their trades, and armed with this admission to their interior, made careful notes and became able to defend in debate the propositions of the tariff and to show that the respective businesses would be carried on and not ruined as they said. I have ever since said that deputations are most admirable aids for the transaction of public business, provided the receiver of them is allowed to fix the occasion and the stage at which they appear.' ...|$|R

[...] The judges being chosen and the disputants enrolled, [...] The question he proceeded in extenso to unfold: [...] "Resolved--The sense of hearing lifts the mind up out of reach [...] Of the fogs of error better than the faculty of speech." [...] This simple proposition he expounded, word by word, [...] Until they best understood it who least perfectly had heard. [...] Even the judges comprehended as he ventured to explain-- [...] The impact of a spit-ball admonishing in vain. [...] Beginning at a period before Creation's morn, [...] He had reached the bounds of tolerance and Adam yet unborn.
