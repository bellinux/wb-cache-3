40|$|We {{propose a}} fast and {{powerful}} analysis algorithm, titled Model-based Analysis of Tiling-arrays (MAT), to reliably detect regions enriched by transcription factor chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on Affymetrix tiling arrays (ChIP-chip). MAT models the baseline probe behavior by considering probe sequence and copy number on each array. It standardizes the probe value through the probe model, {{eliminating the need}} for sample normalization. MAT uses an innovative function to score regions for ChIP enrichment, which allows robust P value and false discovery rate calculations. MAT can detect ChIP regions from a single <b>ChIP</b> sample, <b>multiple</b> <b>ChIP</b> samples, or <b>multiple</b> <b>ChIP</b> samples with controls with increasing accuracy. The single-array ChIP region detection feature minimizes the time and monetary costs for laboratories newly adopting ChIP-chip to test their protocols and antibodies and allows established ChIP-chip laboratories to identify samples with questionable quality that might contaminate their data.

30|$|A direct {{conversion}} of the input PCM stream to PWM is not useful: PWM is a nonlinear technique and the intermodulation between the PWM carrier frequency and the baseband audio signal leads to poor-quality amplifiers [7]. To this aim, in academia and industry [8 – 24], several techniques have been proposed to improve the basic scheme in Figure 1 : new digital audio processing algorithms [12 – 15, 17 – 20, 22 – 24] or novel feedback schemes [9 – 11, 21] or multilevel PWM power bridges [16] have been published to correct the distortions introduced by the PWM modulation or by the nonideal behaviour of the power stage. However the new proposed techniques require extra hardware resources; the performance gain is paid in terms of increased circuital complexity and cost. The overall amplifier often requires <b>multiple</b> <b>chips</b> for the digital part (including digital signal processor and/or ASIC and/or FPGA), plus ADC and high-order analog filters for the feedback plus multiple power transistors and gate drivers for multi level PWM.
