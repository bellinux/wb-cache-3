5|$|A star remains {{near its}} initial {{position}} on the <b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> until {{a significant amount of}} hydrogen in the core has been consumed, then begins to evolve into a more luminous star. (On the HR diagram, the evolving star moves up and {{to the right of the}} <b>main</b> <b>sequence.)</b> Thus the <b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> represents the primary hydrogen-burning stage of a star's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|In addition, stars may be {{classified}} by the luminosity effects {{found in their}} spectral lines, which correspond to their spatial size and is determined by their surface gravity. These range from 0 (hypergiants) through III (giants) to V (<b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> dwarfs); some authors add VII (white dwarfs). Most stars belong to the <b>main</b> <b>sequence,</b> which consists of ordinary hydrogen-burning stars. These fall along a narrow, diagonal band when graphed according to their absolute magnitude and spectral type. The Sun is a <b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> G2V yellow dwarf of intermediate temperature and ordinary size.|$|E
5|$|Main-sequence stars employ {{two types}} of {{hydrogen}} fusion processes, {{and the rate of}} energy generation from each type depends on the temperature in the core region. Astronomers divide the <b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> into upper and lower parts, based on which of the two is the dominant fusion process. In the lower <b>main</b> <b>sequence,</b> energy is primarily generated {{as the result of the}} proton-proton chain, which directly fuses hydrogen together in a series of stages to produce helium. Stars in the upper <b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> have sufficiently high core temperatures to efficiently use the CNO cycle. (See the chart.) This process uses atoms of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen as intermediaries in the process of fusing hydrogen into helium.|$|E

5|$|Other {{factors that}} broaden the <b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> band on the HR diagram include {{uncertainty}} in the distance to stars {{and the presence of}} unresolved binary stars that can alter the observed stellar parameters. However, even perfect observation would show a fuzzy <b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> because mass is not the only parameter that affects a star's color and luminosity. Variations in chemical composition caused by the initial abundances, the star's evolutionary status, interaction with a close companion, rapid rotation, or a magnetic field can all slightly change a main-sequence star's HR diagram position, {{to name just a few}} factors. As an example, there are metal-poor stars (with a very low abundance of elements with higher atomic numbers than helium) that lie just below the <b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> and are known as subdwarfs. These stars are fusing hydrogen in their cores and so they mark the lower edge of <b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> fuzziness caused by variance in chemical composition.|$|E
5|$|Stars {{spend about}} 90% of their {{existence}} fusing hydrogen into helium in high-temperature and high-pressure reactions near the core. Such stars {{are said to be}} on the <b>main</b> <b>sequence,</b> and are called dwarf stars. Starting at zero-age <b>main</b> <b>sequence,</b> the proportion of helium in a star's core will steadily increase, the rate of nuclear fusion at the core will slowly increase, as will the star's temperature and luminosity.|$|E
5|$|When {{a cluster}} of stars is formed {{at about the same}} time, the life span of these stars will depend on their {{individual}} masses. The most massive stars will leave the <b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> first, followed steadily in sequence by stars of ever lower masses. Thus the stars will evolve in order of their position on the <b>main</b> <b>sequence,</b> proceeding from the most massive at the left toward the right of the HR diagram. The current position where stars in this cluster are leaving the <b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> is known as the turn-off point. By knowing the <b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> lifespan of stars at this point, it becomes possible to estimate the age of the cluster.|$|E

5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating variable stars known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects {{the upper part of}} the <b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> in the region of class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating stars in this part of the instability strip that intersects {{the upper part of the}} <b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this instability strip.|$|E

The constellation's dimmer stars were noted by Johann Bayer, who named eight stars including Alpha and Beta, and John Flamsteed, who numbered fourteen. Procyon is the seventh-brightest star in the night sky, {{as well as one}} of the closest. A yellow-white <b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> star, it has a white dwarf companion. Gomeisa is a blue-white <b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> star. Luyten's Star is a ninth-magnitude red dwarf and the Solar System's next closest stellar neighbour in the constellation after Procyon. The fourth-magnitude HD 66141, which has evolved into an orange giant towards the end of its life cycle, was discovered to have a planet in 2012.

5|$|Like the Sun, 47 Ursae Majoris {{is on the}} <b>main</b> <b>sequence,</b> {{converting}} hydrogen to helium in {{its core}} by nuclear fusion. Based on its chromospheric activity, the star may be around 6,000 million years old, though evolutionary models suggest an older age of around 8,700 million years. Other studies have yielded estimates of 4,400 and 7,000 million years for the star.|$|E
5|$|Located near Alpha is Delta Antliae, {{a binary}} star, 430 ± 30 light-years distant from Earth. The primary is a blue-white <b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> star of {{spectral}} type B9.5V and magnitude 5.6, and the secondary is a yellow-white <b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> star of spectral type F9Ve and magnitude 9.6. Zeta Antliae {{is a wide}} optical double star. The brighter star—Zeta1 Antliae—is 410 ± 40 light-years distant and has a magnitude of 5.74, {{though it is a}} true binary star system composed of two white <b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> stars of magnitudes 6.20 and 7.01 that are separated by 8.042 arcseconds. The fainter star—Zeta2 Antliae—is 380 ± 20 light-years distant and of magnitude 5.9. Eta Antliae is another double composed of a yellow white star of spectral type F1V and magnitude 5.31, with a companion of magnitude 11.3. Theta Antliae is likewise double, most likely composed of an A-type <b>main</b> <b>sequence</b> star and a yellow giant. S Antliae is an eclipsing binary star system that varies in apparent magnitude from 6.27 to 6.83 over a period of 15.6 hours. The system is classed as a W Ursae Majoris variable—the primary is hotter than the secondary and the drop in magnitude is caused by the latter passing in front of the former. Calculating the properties of the component stars from the orbital period indicates that the primary star has a mass 1.94 times and a diameter 2.026 times that of the Sun, and the secondary has a mass 0.76 times and a diameter 1.322 times that of the Sun. The two stars have similar luminosity and spectral type as they have a common envelope and share stellar material. The system is thought to be around 5–6 billion years old. The two stars will eventually merge to form a single fast-spinning star.|$|E
