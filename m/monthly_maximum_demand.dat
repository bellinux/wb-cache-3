5000|$|Supply availability, {{otherwise}} known as [...] "supply capacity" [...] or [...] "kVA", if represented by its measured units, is the maximum kVA power allowed for a particular supply in a particular network and is set before the supply is energised. It is a figure agreed between the consumer and the supplier (set to a level required by the consumer in almost all cases except where power distribution may be physically limited to the supply) {{at the start of}} the contract. This supply availability is charged for every month, in effect as a standing charge, despite the fact that the maximum demand recorded in the month may be lower. If the kVA supply availability figure is exceeded (breached, in effect) by the value of the measured <b>monthly</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>demand,</b> also in kVA for this purpose, the higher figure of kVA from the maximum demand may be charged instead of the supply capacity. The new elevated kVA charge figure (or the supplier's nearest higher capacity band figure, if capacity is only allowed in banded levels 50 kVA apart for instance) may stay as the chargeable figure for twelve months depending on the electricity distribution area. This can cause temporary unnecessary high billing, as if a penalty, if the breach was avoidable. Alternatively, the capacity charge can just return to the original availability figure in the subsequent month's bill. Determining the correct capacity figure to allow for the maximum demand required for the supply can be a fine judgement if the capacity charge is to be kept to a minimum, and vigilance of maximum demand and efforts to keep the power demand lower than the agreed capacity can be required to avoid triggering a higher capacity charge during the contract.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{reports a}} new {{methodology}} for the medium term load forecasting providing monthly energy consumption and <b>monthly</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> for a municipal utility. To this aim a modular procedure, {{based on an}} Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is a Multi-Layer Perceptron using a back-propagation feed-forward algorithm, is implemented. The monthly forecasts are obtained through some knowledge based activities from the output of stage providing annual energy forecast. The choice of the prediction stage is reported by illustrating {{the results of a}} comparison with canonical statistical methods, such as Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA. The whole knowledge based procedure is illustrated in due detail and some best forecasting performances are reported thus demonstrating validity of the proposed approach...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 189 - 191). This Master thesis {{investigates the}} application of Peak Load Shaving (PLS) at University of Cape Town Medical School (UCTMS). The purpose was to decrease the <b>monthly</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> (MMD) in kVA such that UCTMS monthly electricity bill is decreased. It was purposed that implementing a three-phase inverter {{in conjunction with a}} lead-acid battery at UCTMS for PLS is technical and financial viable. Five-year UCTMS MMD data history was gathered from UCT maintenance office as well as eight-month UCTMS load profile, which was gathered using the available electrical meter at Electrical Department Substation for Medical School at FalmouthRoad. Control strategies studies from previous works enabled the quickly synchronization of the three-phase inverter to a three-phase grid. It gave a good quality balanced control of the three-phase currents through the filter inductors, consequently gave a good quality control of the real and reactive power. Secondly a PLS algorithm (PLSA) was developed, which had the aim of setting a threshold point (TP) to prevent the MMD supplied to UCTMS to surpass the TP. In addition, the PLSA in conjunction with designed controllers would charge the battery at unity power factor (PF), whenever the MD is below the set TP and discharge at the same PF conversely, hence limiting the MMD at the TP. To test the purposed PLS topology, simplorer simulator was used, where two daily UCTMS load profile were simulated. The controls design and PLSA were implemented and the result showed that implementing PLS at UCTMS is technical viable. In practice, a prototype was built to show the synchronization of the three-phase inverter with three-phase grid by using a digital phase locked loop PI-based controller implemented in a DSP chip...|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{method of}} <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> {{determination}} of a multi category bulk electrical installation at planning stage {{is done by}} using several rules of thumb, in which <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> and time at which <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> occurs cannot be estimated accurately. This incorrect <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> estimation caused for wrong transformer and backup power capacity estimation, wrong cable and switchgear selection, inefficient performance of transformer, incorrect statistics, etc. In this research, a methodology is proposed to determine the <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> of multi category bulk electrical installation using its entire kVA profile. This entire kVA profile of multi category bulk electrical installation is generated through a database of kVA profiles in which averaged normalized kVA profile for each installation categories have been defined along with their electrical power loading characteristics. Multi category bulk electrical installation {{can be considered as}} a combination of several single category bulk electrical installations. Hence, to determine the entire kVA profile of a multi category bulk electrical installation, averaged normalized common kVA profiles which represent each category will be added together with multiplying them by their individual calculated <b>maximum</b> <b>demand.</b> To compile the database of averaged normalized common kVA profiles, kVA profiles (each contains kVA values of one month logging period with 15 minute intervals) of 500 numbers of single category bulk electrical installations have been considered as the sample. The sample is preprocessed, normalized and then clustered using Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm. By using square sum of error of each clusters and Knee point criterion, seventeen numbers of unique kVA pattern classes were identified. Then averaged normalized kVA profiles were derived for each pattern class and map them up with example single category bulk electrical installations and their characteristics to compile above said averaged normalized kVA profile database. Visual basic programming and Matlab software is used to execute above said research work. This proposed methodology has been verified considering a multi category electrical installation and proposed methodology can be considered as an acceptable one to determine the <b>maximum</b> <b>demand</b> of multi category bulk electrical installations. This methodology can be further improved by compiling averaged normalized kVA profile database for each installation categories separately. Additionally, this research can be further improved as a required tool for load forecasting, demand-side management, system planning, distribution system loss estimation and better tariff design, etc...|$|R
