5|$|Richard Basset (died between 1135 and 1144) was a royal {{judge and}} sheriff {{during the reign}} of King Henry I of England. His father was also a royal justice. In about 1122 Basset married the {{eventual}} heiress of another other justice; the <b>marriage</b> <b>settlement</b> has survived. In 1129–30 Basset was co-sheriff of eleven counties. Basset and his wife founded a monastic house in 1125 from their lands, which before the donation were equivalent to 15 knight's fees.|$|E
5|$|The 1174 peace did {{not deal}} with the long-running {{tensions}} between Henry and Louis, however, and these resurfaced during the late 1170s. The two kings now began to compete for control of Berry, a prosperous region of value to both kings. Henry had some rights to western Berry, but in 1176 announced an extraordinary claim that he had agreed in 1169 to give Richard's fiancée Alice the whole province {{as part of the}} <b>marriage</b> <b>settlement.</b> If Louis accepted this, it would have implied that the Berry was Henry's to give away in the first place, and would have given Henry the right to occupy it on Richard's behalf. To put additional pressure on Louis, Henry mobilised his armies for war. The papacy intervened and, probably as Henry had planned, the two kings were encouraged to sign a non-aggression treaty in September 1177, under which they promised to undertake a joint crusade. The ownership of the Auvergne and parts of the Berry were put to an arbitration panel, which reported in favour of Henry; Henry followed up this success by purchasing La Marche from the local count. This expansion of Henry's empire once again threatened French security and promptly put the new peace at risk.|$|E
50|$|The {{marriage}} contract can also specify where the couple will live, {{whether or not}} the first wife will allow the husband to take a second wife without her consent, {{whether or not the}} wife has the right to initiate divorce, and other such matters. The {{marriage contract}} somewhat resembles the <b>marriage</b> <b>settlements</b> once negotiated for upper-class Western brides, but can extend to non-financial matters usually ignored by <b>marriage</b> <b>settlements</b> or pre-nuptial agreements.|$|R

5|$|News {{of their}} {{engagement}} appeared in The Times and The Daily Telegraph newspapers on 14October 1963, {{and the two}} were married at Holy Trinity Church, Brompton on 20November. After a ceremony attended by Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone (one of whose ladies-in-waiting had been a relative of Lady Lucan), but by few other prominent members of high society, the couple honeymooned in Europe, travelling first class on the Orient Express. Lucan's already embattled finances were given a welcome boost by his father, who provided him with a <b>marriage</b> <b>settlement</b> designed to finance a larger family home and any future additions to the Lucan family. Lucan repaid some of his creditors and purchased 46Lower Belgrave Street, Belgravia, redecorating it to suit Veronica's tastes. Two months after the wedding, on 21January 1964, the 6thEarl of Lucan died of a stroke. In addition to a reputed £250,000 inheritance, Lucan acquired his father's titles: Earl of Lucan; Baron Lucan of Castlebar; Baron Lucan of Melcombe Lucan and Baronet Bingham of Castlebar. His wife became the Countess of Lucan. Their first child, Frances, was born on 24October 1964, and early the next year they employed a nanny, Lillian Jenkins, to look after her. Lucan tried to teach Veronica about gambling and traditional pursuits like hunting, shooting, and fishing. He bought her golf lessons; she later gave up the sport.|$|E
25|$|The house {{passed from}} Lord Northampton to the Earls of Suffolk, who were another {{branch of the}} {{powerful}} Howard family headed by the Dukes of Norfolk, and in the 1640s it was sold to the Earl of Northumberland at the discounted price of £15,000 {{as part of the}} <b>marriage</b> <b>settlement</b> when he married a Howard.|$|E

25|$|Jasper More's sons died, {{leaving no}} male heir. The estates {{were held in}} an entail whereby {{inheritance}} was restricted to male heirs, but Samuel father, Richard, in the <b>marriage</b> <b>settlement</b> paid 600 pounds to Jasper More, so {{there must have been}} clear title. It was arranged that Katherine would marry her cousin and indeed, on 4 February 1610, (old date style) Katherine, 25, the last unmarried daughter of Jasper, married 17-year-old cousin, Samuel More.|$|E
25|$|In 833 Emperor Theophilus {{sent the}} nobleman Petronas Kamateros, who had {{recently}} overseen {{the construction of the}} Khazar fortress of Sarkel, to take direct control over the city and its environs, establishing the theme of Klimata/Cherson. It remained in Byzantine hands until the 980s, when it reportedly fell to Kiev. Vladimir the Great agreed to evacuate the fortress only if Basil II's sister Anna Porphyrogeneta would be given him in marriage. The demand caused a scandal in Constantinople. As a pre-condition for the <b>marriage</b> <b>settlement,</b> Vladimir was baptized here in 988, thus paving the way to the Baptism of Kievan Rus'. Thereafter Korsun' was evacuated.|$|E
25|$|Both Theophilus and Susannah Maria {{were members}} of the Drury Lane theatre company managed by Cibber. From 1735, Cibber began drawing his wife's {{earnings}} from the theatre personally, ignoring the <b>marriage</b> <b>settlement,</b> and by 1737 he was even selling her clothes and personal effects to make money. In 1738, the couple were involved in a notorious lawsuit which drew public attention to Cibber's connivance in his wife's adultery. The Cibbers had established a ménage à trois with John Sloper, a country squire, from whom Theophilus accepted money. The three of them set up house together in Kensington, for which Sloper paid the rent and maintenance, until Cibber slipped away to France to escape his creditors. To his dismay, Susannah Maria wrote him a letter to say that she was leaving him for Sloper.|$|E

25|$|Sir Robert {{eventually}} convinced Jane {{to marry}} him, {{and with the}} assistance of Jane's advisers, notaries Robert Scurfield and Joseph John Wright, the <b>marriage</b> <b>settlement</b> stipulated that half of her income should be at her own disposal, but Sir Robert secured £1,000 a year for his own private use. The couple were married on 6 November 1815 at St Michael's Church, Houghton-le-Spring; she aged about 64 and he about 43. Peat had tried to introduce his wife to fashionable society in London, but on finding she had slipped away from the guests and was found talking to the servants in the kitchen, he thought her seemingly unfit for it and returned her to Sunderland. He lived apart from her at his vicarage in New Brentford and visited her just twice a year.|$|E
25|$|On June 30, 1109, King Alfonso VI died. He was {{succeeded by}} Queen Urraca, who {{remarried}} in 1109 {{to the king}} of Aragon, Alfonso the Battler, a soldier by nature who was immediately received as king in Castille and León, but not in Galicia. As part of the <b>marriage</b> <b>settlement,</b> any children born to the union were to have priority over Raymond's son Alfonso in the succession. In Galicia this union {{was rejected by the}} old party of count Raymond, now led by count Pedro Fróilaz, tutor of young Alfonso, although the partisans of Urraca also joined forces. With Leon and Castille quiet and under control, Alfonso moved on Galicia in 1110, and while he did not suffer any major defeat, he had little success, returning three months later to León. Probably as a consequence to this development, Pedro Froila drew Diego Gelmirez to his party. In 1111, the young Alfonso Raimúndez was crowned and anointed king in Compostela.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately Consuelo Vanderbilt had no {{interest}} in the duke, being secretly engaged to an American, Winthrop Rutherfurd. Her mother cajoled, wheedled, begged, and then, ultimately, ordered her daughter to marry Marlborough. When Consuelo – a docile teenager whose only notable characteristic at the time was abject obedience to her fearsome mother – made plans to elope, she was locked in her room as Alva threatened to murder Rutherfurd. Still, she refused. It was only when Alva Vanderbilt claimed that her health was being seriously and irretrievably undermined by Consuelo's stubbornness and appeared to be at death's door that the malleable girl acquiesced. Alva made an astonishing recovery from her entirely phantom illness, and when the wedding took place, Consuelo stood at the altar reportedly weeping behind her veil. The duke, for his part, gave up the woman he reportedly loved back in England and collected US$2.5million (approximately US$67.7 million in 2015 dollars) in railroad stock as a <b>marriage</b> <b>settlement.</b> Consuelo's father built a mansion for her in London, Sunderland House in Curzon Street.|$|E

500|$|Basset married Matilda, the {{daughter}} and eventual heiress of Geoffrey Ridel (d. 1120), some time between 1120 and 1123. Matilda {{had a brother}} Robert, who was mentioned in her <b>marriage</b> <b>settlement.</b> [...] By {{the terms of the}} settlement, Robert Ridel was placed under the guardianship of Richard Basset until he was knighted and married to Basset's niece. The <b>marriage</b> <b>settlement</b> describes Matilda's dowry as being worth four knight's fees. Basset also received the right to arrange marriages for Matilda's sisters. Robert's lands were to come to Basset if Robert had no children. Not long after the settlement was written, Basset was in possession of the lands that should have been Robert's.|$|E
500|$|Castell Coch ( [...] ; [...] ) is a 19th-century Gothic Revival castle built {{above the}} village of Tongwynlais in South Wales. The first castle on the site was built by the Normans after 1081, to protect the newly conquered town of Cardiff and control the route along the Taff Gorge. Abandoned shortly afterwards, the castle's earth motte was reused by Gilbert de Clare {{as the basis for}} a new stone fortification, which he built between 1267 and 1277 to control his freshly annexed Welsh lands. This castle was likely {{destroyed}} in the native Welsh rebellion of 1314. In 1760, the castle ruins were acquired by John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, as part of a <b>marriage</b> <b>settlement</b> that brought the family vast estates in South Wales.|$|E
500|$|Richard did not acquire Caerphilly Castle {{as part of}} the <b>marriage</b> <b>settlement,</b> so he {{set about}} redeveloping Cardiff instead. He built a new tower {{alongside}} the Black Tower in 1430, restoring the gateway, and extended the motte defences. He also constructed a substantial new domestic range in the south-west of the site between 1425 and 1439, with a central octagonal tower [...] high, sporting defensive machicolations, and featuring four smaller polygonal turrets facing the inner bailey. The range was built of Lias ashlar stone with limestone used for some of the details, set upon the spur bases characteristic of South Wales and incorporated parts of the older 4th and 13th century walls. The buildings were influenced by similar work in the previous century at Windsor Castle and would in turn shape renovations at Newport and Nottingham Castles; the octagonal tower has architectural links to Guy's Tower, built at around the same time in Warwick Castle. A flower garden was built to the south of the range, with private access to Richard's chambers. Richard also rebuilt the town's wider defences, including a new stone bridge over the River Taff guarded by the West Gate, finishing the work by 1451.|$|E
60|$|This {{interval}} {{was intended}} to serve a double purpose.

50|$|When Lord Petre died in 1638 an {{inventory}} {{showed that he}} had no debts, £7,500 cash in hand (approximately £657,000 today) and £4,000 in realizable loans (approximately £350,000 today). The rents for Essex and Devon totalled £13,500 (approximately £1,183,000 today); owing to inflation, the increase in rents was over three-fold, so that the main branch of the family had more than held its own since 1540, in spite of expensive <b>marriage</b> <b>settlements.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the century}} {{prior to the}} Norman invasion, England's great estates, owned by the king, bishops, monasteries and thegns had been slowly broken up as a {{consequence}} of inheritance, wills, <b>marriage</b> <b>settlements</b> or church purchases. Most of the smaller landowning nobility lived on their properties and managed their own estates. The pre-Norman landscape had seen a trend away from isolated hamlets and towards larger villages engaged in arable cultivation in a band running north-south across England.|$|R
500|$|Rowe was {{the first}} biographer to record the tradition, {{repeated}} by Johnson, that Shakespeare retired to Stratford [...] "some years before his death". He was still working as an actor in London in 1608; in {{an answer to the}} sharers' petition in 1635, Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 from Henry Evans, the King's Men [...] "placed men players" [...] there, [...] "which were Heminges, Condell, Shakespeare, etc.". However, it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in London throughout 1609. The London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague (a total of over 60 months closure between May 1603 and February 1610), which meant there was often no acting work. Retirement from all work was uncommon at that time. Shakespeare continued to visit London during the years 1611–1614. In 1612, he was called as a witness in Bellott v. Mountjoy, a court case concerning the <b>marriage</b> <b>settlement</b> of Mountjoy's daughter, Mary. In March 1613, he bought a gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory; and from November 1614, he was in London for several weeks with his son-in-law, John Hall. After 1610, Shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after 1613. His last three plays were collaborations, probably with John Fletcher, who succeeded him as the house playwright of the King's Men.|$|E
2500|$|On marriage, Florence Conybeare {{became the}} 'beneficial owner' of, among other properties, the Tregullow Offices, a small {{dwelling}} and former mine office [...] in Scorrier in the County of Cornwall, {{as part of}} a <b>marriage</b> <b>settlement</b> which her husband, Charles A.V. Conybeare, arranged with various parties including the wealthy merchant banker Isaac Seligman. The <b>marriage</b> <b>settlement</b> was effected by means of a Deed of Trust signed by three moneylenders, two of whom had attended the same public school as Charles Conybeare: Tonbridge School, in Kent, and one family member (uncle). [...] "In those days, a <b>marriage</b> <b>settlement</b> was settled upon the marriage." [...] Such settlements can be compared to prenuptials and {{should not be confused with}} financial settlements made on the dissolution of a marriage. In those days, it was a convenient way for a husband-to-be to make adequate financial provision for his wife-to-be. This prevented a wife from otherwise becoming destitute as a result of the husband deserting his wife, or from having to resort to prostitution in order to support herself.|$|E
2500|$|... "Although Henry Conybeare and Isaac Seligman {{became the}} owners of the legal estate the moment it was {{conveyed}} to them in 1896, they never actually owned the properties themselves.
