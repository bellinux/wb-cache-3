50|$|The metal {{substrate}} (steel or aluminum) {{is delivered}} in coil form from the rolling mills. Coil weights vary from 5-6 tons for aluminum {{and up to}} about 25 tons for steel. The coil is positioned {{at the beginning of}} the line, then unwound at a constant speed, passing through the various pre-treatment and coating processes before being recoiled. Two strip accumulators at the beginning and the end of the line enable the work to be continuous, allowing new coils to be added (and finished coils removed) by a <b>metal</b> <b>stitching</b> process without having to slow down or stop the line.|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 79 - 90 In today?s {{marketplace}} {{the repairs}} of various components especially long lead items for turbomachinery equipment {{are an important}} factor for the maintaining reliability and performance of the equipment. This paper will describe repairs applied to compressors and steam turbines. Various types of repairs will be discussed {{and how they are}} applied to rotors, stationary components such as diaphragms and casings. The repairs will be applied to various scenarios that the components have been subjected to. The areas covered will be: Mechanical damage caused by rub of rotor on shaft/diaphragm; Foreign object damage; Erosion caused by either solid particle or liquid; Fretting damage; Fatigue; Creep; Corrosion. Also a review and understanding of the damage mechanisms and what analysis and/or nondestructive testing (NDT) method can be applied to quantify the damage and maintain the reliability of the repair. Various methods will be discussed to assess the damage mechanisms and how to evaluate the extent of the damage so one can assess whether a repair is necessary or the component can function as an as-in condition. Types of repair methods that will be discussed are weld repairs, application of sprayed coating, mechanical fixes, electroless/electrolytic type coating and <b>metal</b> <b>stitching</b> type fixes. The repair methods applied are design process procedures utilizing a design for fitness for service approach...|$|E

Beginning May 31, 2016, the California-based <b>metal</b> band <b>Stitched</b> Up Heart would replace Butcher Babies as main support.|$|R

50|$|With {{anesthesia}} induced, {{the surgical}} team prepares {{the eye to}} be operated on and drapes the face around the eye. An eyelid speculum is placed to keep the lids open, and some lubrication {{is placed on the}} eye to prevent drying. In children, a <b>metal</b> ring is <b>stitched</b> to the sclera which will provide support of the sclera during the procedure.|$|R
5000|$|Couching or laid {{stitches}} involve {{two sets}} of threads: the set that is being 'laid' {{onto the surface of}} the fabric and the set which attaches the laid threads. The laid threads may be heavier than the attaching thread, or they may be of a nature that does not allow them to be worked like a regular embroidery thread, such as <b>metal</b> threads. The <b>stitches</b> used to attach the laid thread may be of any nature—cross stitch, buttonhole stitch, or straight stitch—but some have specific names: ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1975, Poventud and José Glóro {{provided}} the musical background for Che Guevara Speaks, {{a recording of}} an interview with Ernesto [...] "Che" [...] Guevarra before Guevara was sent to Bolivia. Poventud had an accident {{two days before the}} recording and showed up with and injured thumb that was held in place with a <b>metal</b> pin and <b>stitches.</b> Despite this injury, Poventud played an accordion for the occasion. In 1976, Poventud made the arrangements and was the first guitarist in Pepe and Flora's album En La Lucha. That same year, he also participated in the protests in favor of Puerto Rican independence in front of the United Nations Building in New York.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCollar {{transverse}} incision is {{the typical}} surgical access for operations on thyroid and parathyroids. The cosmetic outcome resulting from its closure is {{of paramount importance}} given its anatomical exposure. The traditional methods of closure include <b>metal</b> clips, subcuticular <b>stitch</b> and glue. In this study we evaluated the cosmetic results on 10 patients who had their cervicotomy wound closed with clips comparing it to a second group of 10 patients who had the same incision closed with subcuticular stitch. The cosmetic outcome was evaluated with a questionnaire answered by the patients, by the operating surgeon and by a surgical nurse who was blinded to the technique used. The results of the questionnaire were grossly similar with no differences in the two groups. Only two complications were recorded in the subcuticular group. Both the techniques associate to similar cosmetic outcome, and the choice between the two should be left to the surgeon's personal preference...|$|R
40|$|Currently {{available}} neuroendovascular {{devices are}} inadequate for effective treatment of many wide-necked or fusiform intracranial aneurysms and intracranial carotid-cavernous fistulae (CCF). Placing a covered microstent across the intracranial aneurysm neck and CCF rent could restore normal vessel morphology by preventing blood {{flow into the}} aneurysm lumen or CCF rent. To fabricate covered microstents, our research group has developed highly flexible ultra thin (~ 150 μm) silicone coverings and elastomerically captured them onto commercially available <b>metal</b> stents without <b>stitching.</b> Preliminary in vivo studies were conducted by placing these covered microstents in the common carotid artery of rabbits. The feasibility of using covered stents was demonstrated. However, the cover affected the deployment pressure and the stents failed occasionally during deployment due to tearing of the cover. Appropriate modeling of covered stents will assist in designing suitable coverings, and help to reduce the failure rate of covered microstents. The {{purpose of this study}} is to use the finite element method to determine the mechanical properties of the covered microstent and investigate the effects of the covering on the mechanical behavior of the covered microstent. Variations in the mechanical properties of the covered microstent such as deployment pressure, elastic recoil and longitudinal shortening due to change in thickness and material properties of the cover have been investigated. This work is also important for custom design of covered microstents such as adding cutout holes to save adjacent perforating arteries...|$|R
