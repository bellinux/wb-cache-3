Excitation at which the power factor is unity is termed normal excitation voltage. The magnitude of current at this excitation is minimum. Excitation voltage more than normal excitation is called over excitation voltage, excitation voltage less than normal excitation is called under excitation. When the motor is over excited, the back emf will be greater than the <b>motor</b> <b>terminal</b> voltage. This causes a demagnetizing effect due to armature reaction.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} whether activity {{is a contributing}} factor to <b>motor</b> <b>terminal</b> degeneration in mice that overexpress the G 93 A mutation of the SOD 1 enzyme found in humans with inherited motor neuron disease. Previously, we showed that overload of muscles accomplished by synergist denervation accelerated <b>motor</b> <b>terminal</b> degeneration in dogs with hereditary canine spinal muscular atrophy (HCSMA). In the present study, we found that SOD 1 plantaris muscles overloaded for 2 months showed no differences of neuromuscular junction innervation status when compared with normally loaded, contralateral plantaris muscles. Complete elimination of <b>motor</b> <b>terminal</b> activity using blockade of sciatic nerve conduction with tetrodotoxin cuffs for 1 month also produced no change of plantaris innervation status. To assess possible effects of activity on <b>motor</b> <b>terminal</b> function, we examined the synaptic properties of SOD 1 soleus neuromuscular junctions {{at a time when}} significant denervation of close synergists had occurred as a result of natural disease progression. When examined in glucose media, SOD 1 soleus synaptic properties were similar to wildtype. When glycolysis was inhibited and ATP production limited to mitochondria, however, blocking of evoked synaptic transmission occurred and a large increase in the frequency of spontaneous mEPCs was observed. Similar effects were observed at neuromuscular junctions in muscle from dogs with inherited motor neuron disease (HCSMA), although significant defects of synaptic transmission exist at these neuromuscular junctions when examined in glucose media, as reported previously. These results suggest that glycolysis compensates for mitochondrial dysfunction at motor terminals of SOD 1 mice and HCSMA dogs. This compensatory mechanism may help to support resting and activity-related metabolism in the presence of dysfunctional mitochondria and prolong the survival of SOD 1 motor terminals...|$|E

40|$|In Drosophila, {{the type}} I <b>motor</b> <b>terminals</b> innervating the larval ventral {{longitudinal}} muscle fibers 6 and 7 {{have been the}} most popular preparation for combining synaptic studies with genetics. We have further characterized the normal morphological and physiological properties of these <b>motor</b> <b>terminals</b> and the influence of muscle size on terminal morphology. Using dye-injection and physiological techniques, we show that the two axons supplying these terminals have different innervation patterns: axon 1 innervates only muscle fibers 6 and 7, whereas axon 2 innervates all of the ventral longitudinal muscle fibers. This difference in innervation pattern allows the two axons to be reliably identified. The terminals formed by axons 1 and 2 on muscle fibers 6 and 7 have the same number of branches; however, axon 2 terminals are approximately 30 % longer than axon 1 terminals, resulting in a corresponding greater number of boutons for axon 2. The axon 1 boutons are approximately 30 % wider than the axon 2 boutons. The excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) produced by axon 1 is generally smaller than that produced by axon 2, although the size distributions show considerable overlap. Consistent with vertebrate studies, there is a correlation between muscle fiber size and terminal size. For a single axon, terminal area and length, the number of terminal branches, and the number of boutons are all correlated with muscle fiber size, but bouton size is not. During prolonged repetitive stimulation, axon 2 <b>motor</b> <b>terminals</b> show synaptic depression, whereas axon 1 EPSPs facilitate.

40|$|The {{electrical}} gradient {{across the}} mitochondrial inner membrane (Ψm) is established by electron transport chain (ETC) activity and permits mitochondrial Ca 2 + sequestration. Using rhodamine- 123, we determined how repetitive nerve stimulation (100 Hz) affects Ψm in <b>motor</b> <b>terminals</b> innervating mouse levator auris muscles. Stimulation-induced Ψm depolarizations in wild-type (WT) terminals were small (< 5 mV at 30 °C) and reversible. These depolarizations depended on Ca 2 + influx into <b>motor</b> <b>terminals,</b> {{as they were}} inhibited when P/Q-type Ca 2 + channels were blocked with ω-agatoxin. Stimulation-induced Ψm depolarization and elevation of cytosolic [Ca 2 +] both increased when complex I of the ETC was partially inhibited by low concentrations of rotenone (25 – 50 nmol/l). This {{finding is consistent with}} the hypothesis that acceleration of ETC proton extrusion normally limits the magnitude of Ψm depolarization during mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake, thereby permitting continued Ca 2 + uptake. Compared with WT, stimulation-induced increases in rhodamine- 123 fluorescence were ≈ 5 times larger in <b>motor</b> <b>terminals</b> from presymptomatic mice expressing mutations of human superoxide dismutase I (SOD 1) that cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SOD 1 -G 85 R, which lacks dismutase activity; SOD 1 -G 93 A, which retains dismutase activity). Ψm depolarizations were not significantly altered by expression of WT human SOD 1 or knockout of SOD 1 or by inhibiting opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore with cyclosporin A. We suggest that an early functional consequence of the association of SOD 1 -G 85 R or SOD 1 -G 93 A with motoneuronal mitochondria is reduced capacity of the ETC to limit Ca 2 +-induced Ψm depolarization, and that this impairment contributes to disease progression in mutant SOD 1 <b>motor</b> <b>terminals...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} modeling, {{simulation}} {{and implementation of}} Load Commutated SCR based current source Inverter (LCI) fed squirrel cage induction motor drive with sinusoidal voltage and sinusoidal current. In the proposed system, the induction motor is fed by an LCI. A three level diode clamped voltage source inverter (VSI) is connected at the <b>motor</b> <b>terminal</b> with ac chokes connected in series with it. The VSI currents are controlled {{in such a manner}} that it injects the reactive current demanded by the induction motor and the LCI for successful commutation of the SCRs in the LCI. Additionally, it absorbs the harmonic frequency currents to ensure that the induction motor draws sinusoidal current. As a result, the nature of the <b>motor</b> <b>terminal</b> voltage is also sinusoidal. The concept of load commutation of the SCRs in the LCI feeding an induction motor load is explained with necessary waveforms and phasor diagrams. The necessity of reactive compensation by the active filter connected at the <b>motor</b> <b>terminal</b> for the load commutation of the thyristors, is elaborated with the help of analytical equations and phasor diagrams. The requirement of harmonic compensation by the same active filter to achieve sinusoidal motor current and motor voltage, is also described. Finally, to achieve the aforementioned induction motor drive, the VA ratings of the active filter (VSI) and the CSI with respect to VA rating of the motor, are determined theoretically. The proposed drive scheme is simulated under idealized condition. Simulation results show good steady state and dynamic response of the drive system. Load commutation of the SCRs in the LCI and the sinusoidal profile of motor current and voltage, have been demonstrated. As in LCI fed synchronous motor drives, a special mode of operation is required to run up the induction motor from standstill. As the SCRs of the LCI are load commutated, they need <b>motor</b> <b>terminal</b> voltages for commutation. At standstill these voltages are zero. So, a starting strategy has been proposed and adopted to start the motor with the aid of the current controlled VSI to accelerate until the <b>motor</b> <b>terminal</b> voltages are high enough for the commutation of the SCRs in the LCI. The proposed drive is implemented on an experimental setup in the laboratory. The IGBT based three level diode clamped VSI has been fabricated following the design of the standard module in the laboratory. A generalized digital control platform is also developed using a TMS 320 F 2407 A DSP. Two, three phase thyristor bridges with necessary firing pulse circuits have been used as the phase controlled rectifier and the LCI respectively. Appropriate protection scheme for such a drive is developed and adopted to operate the drive. Relevant experimental results are presented. They are observed to be in good agreement with the simulation results. The effect of capacitors connected at the output of the LCI in the commutation process of the SCRs in the LCI is studied and analyzed. From the analysis, it is understood that the capacitors form a parallel resonating pair with filter inductor and the motor leakage inductance, which results in an undesired oscillation in the terminal voltage during each of the commutation intervals leading to commutation failure. So, in the final system, the capacitors are removed to eliminate any chance of commutation failure of the SCRs in the LCI. It is shown by experiment that the commutation of the SCRs takes place reliably {{in the absence of the}} capacitors also. The commutation process is studied and analyzed without the capacitors to understand the <b>motor</b> <b>terminal</b> voltage waveform of the experimental results...|$|E

To control for {{isolation from the}} dam, the remaining five littermates were removed on the same schedule but not suspended. Another litter of 10 rats housed {{in the same room}} provided a vivarium control.

The percentage of multiple innervation and the complexity of singly-innervated <b>motor</b> <b>terminal</b> endings were assessed in silver/cholinesterase stained sections.

Unexpectedly, in the EDL of unloaded rats, transition from embryonic to fast myosin expression was retarded.

Increasing the Ca 2 + load delivered to the terminal by increasing the number of stimuli (from 500 to 2000) or the stimulation frequency (from 50 to 100 Hz), by increasing bath [Ca 2 +], or by prolonging the action potential with 3, 4 -diaminopyridine (100 μm) prolonged the post-stimulation decay of mitochondrial [Ca 2 +] without increasing the amplitude of the plateau during stimulation. Inhibiting the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore with cyclosporin A (5 μm) had no significant effect on the decay of mitochondrial [Ca 2 +]. Inhibition of the mitochondrial Na+–Ca 2 + exchanger with CGP- 37157 (50 μm) dramatically prolonged the post-stimulation decay of mitochondrial [Ca 2 +], reduced post-stimulation residual cytosolic [Ca 2 +], and reduced the amplitude of endplate potentials evoked after the end of a stimulus train in the presence of both low and normal bath [Ca 2 +].

ConclusionThese results suggest that the addition of Lixelle™ to the high-flux dialyzer is associated with a significant clinical improvement in DRA patients...|$|E
40|$|We report here {{original}} {{data on the}} biological basis of prolonged neuromuscular paralysis caused by the toxic phospholipase A 2 β-bungarotoxin. Electron microscopy and immunocytochemical labeling with anti-synaptophysin and anti-neurofilament {{have been used to}} show that the early onset of paralysis is associated with the depletion of synaptic vesicles from the <b>motor</b> nerve <b>terminals</b> of skeletal muscle and that this is followed by the destruction of the <b>motor</b> nerve <b>terminal</b> and the degeneration of the cytoskeleton of the intramuscular axons. The postjunctional architecture of the junctions were unaffected and the binding of fluorescein-isothiocyanate-conjugated α-bungarotoxin to achetylcholine receptor was not apparently affected by exposure to β-bungarotoxin. The re-innervation of the muscle fiber was associated by extensive pre- and post-terminal sprouting at 3 to 5 days but was stable by 7 days. Extensive collateral innervation of adjacent muscle fibers was a significant feature of the re-innervated neuromuscular junctions. These findings suggest that the prolonged and severe paralysis seen in victims of envenoming bites by kraits (elapid snakes of the genus Bungarus) and other related snakes of the family Elapidae is caused by the de-pletion of synaptic vesicles from <b>motor</b> nerve <b>terminals</b> and the degeneration of the <b>motor</b> nerve <b>terminal</b> and intramuscular axons...|$|R

40|$|Protecting the IGBTs against {{short circuit}} {{conditions}} {{is a critical}} aspect of the Industrial motor drive design. The SC (short circuit) conditions can occur {{in a variety of}} ways in an industrial environment. The SC applied across the <b>motor</b> drive <b>terminals</b> result in a different fault current profile than a SC that happens at the <b>motor</b> <b>terminals</b> or between inter winding coils. The packaging parameters such as number of wire bond contacts, thermal impedance of the package also have significant impact on the short circuit current profile and the robustness of the system. The voltage spike suppression methods and gate driver response to the over current shut down conditions influence the robustness of the system. This paper studies the influence of the inductance of the short circuit on the saturation current of the IGBT and its effects on the device robustness. The paper also briefly discusses the transient suppression methods and soft shut down methods for the gate drive circuit to improve the robustness...|$|R
