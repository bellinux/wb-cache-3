40|$|The {{universal}} {{adoption of}} biomass materials as an alternate fuel source to fossil fuels for transportation and electricity has been hindered {{by the high}} transportation costs involved in fuel production. Optimization of these initial costs will make the eco-friendly fuels more economically viable. Biomass is a promising feedstock for biofuels primarily {{because it is a}} renewable and sustainable resource. Among the most studied grassland crops, switchgrass is a perennial warm-season grass and has been identified as a potential energy crop. This research focuses on evaluating various physical parameters which affect the economic feasibility of packaging and transporting switchgrass from the field to the biorefinery. The switchgrass was harvested using a <b>mower</b> <b>conditioner</b> followed by field chopping after varying drying periods. The first harvesting period spanned from early November to mid December 2007 and the second was August to October 2008. Densification properties of chopped switchgrass were studied under compression. The effects of compressive stresses (41 to 101 kPa), number of strokes (1 to 10), moisture content (9 to 62 percent) and chopping length (63 and 95 mm) on the densification of chopped switchgrass were studied. The final dry matter density (DMD) increased with the compressive stresses and the number of strokes, small chop length and low moisture content. The maximum free-standing DMD obtained was 245 kg/m^ 3...|$|E
40|$|Round-bale silage {{harvesting}} {{and processing}} methods were assessed to evaluate overwintering ability and dry matter (DM) yield, fermentation quality and palatability of overwintered dwarf Napiergrass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach) {{in the two}} years following establishment in Nagasaki, Japan, in May 2013 using rooted tillers with a density of 2 plants/m 2. In 2014, harvesting methods under no-wilting treatment were compared for flail-type harvesting with a round-baler (Flail/baler plot) and mower conditioning with a round-baler (Mower/baler plot), which is common for beef-calf–producing farmers in the region. In 2015, the effect of ensilage with wilting was investigated only in the Mower/baler plot. Dwarf Napiergrass was cut twice, in early August (summer) and late November (late autumn), each year. The winter survival rate was greater than 96 % in May both years. The DM yield in the Mower/baler plot did not differ significantly for the first summer cutting or the annual total from the Flail/baler plot, but did show inferior yield for the second cutting. The fermentation quality of the second-cut plants, estimated using the V 2 -score, was higher in the Flail/baler plot than in the Mower/baler plot, possibly because of higher air-tightness, and the second-cut silage tended to have better fermentation quality than the first-cut silage in both harvesting plots. Wilting improved the fermentation quality of dwarf Napiergrass silage in summer, but not in autumn. The palatability of the silage, as estimated by alternative and voluntary intake trials using Japanese Black beef cattle, did not differ significantly between plots. The results suggest that dwarf Napiergrass can be better harvested using a <b>mower</b> <b>conditioner</b> with processing by a round-baler, an approach common to beef-calf–producing farmers, than with the flail/baler system, without reducing the persistence, yield, or palatability of the silage. Moreover, wilting treatment improved the fermentation quality of the dwarf Napiergrass silage when processed in summer...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{evaluating}} {{the intensity of}} Tifton 85 conditioning using a <b>mower</b> <b>conditioner</b> with free-swinging flail fingers and storage times on dehydration curve, fungi presence, nutritional value and in vitro digestibility of Tifton 85 bermudagrass hay dry matter (DM). The dehydration curve was determined in the whole plant for ten times until the baling. The zero time corresponded to the plant before cutting, which occurred at 11 : 00 and the other collections were carried out at 8 : 00, 10 : 00, 14 : 00, and 16 : 00. The experimental design was randomised blocks with two intensities of conditioning (high and low) and ten sampling times, with five replications. The high and low intensities related to adjusting the deflector plate of the free iron fingers (8 and 18 cm). In order to determine gas exchanges during Tifton 85 bermudagrass dehydration, there were evaluations of mature leaves, which {{were placed in the}} upper middle third of each branch before the cutting, at every hour for 4 hours. A portable gas analyser was used by an infrared IRGA (6400 xt). The analysed variables were photosynthesis (A), stomatal conductance (gs), internal CO 2 concentration (Ci), transpiration (T), water use efficiency (WUE), and intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi). In the second part of this study, the nutritional value of Tifton 85 hay was evaluated, so randomised blocks were designed in a split plot through time, with two treatments placed in the following plots: high and low intensity of cutting and five different time points as subplots: cutting (additional treatment), baling and after 30, 60, and 90 days of storage. Subsequently, fungi that were in green plants as well as hay were determined and samples were collected from the grass at the cutting period, during baling, and after 30, 60, and 90 days of storage. It was observed that Tifton 85 bermudagrass dehydration occurred within 49 hours, so this was considered the best time for drying hay. Gas exchanges were more intense before cutting, although after cutting they decreased until ceasing within 4 hours. The lowest values of acid detergent insoluble nitrogen were obtained with low conditioning intensity after 30 days of storage, 64. 8 g/kg DM. The in vitro dry matter of Tifton 85 bermudagrass did not differ among the storage times or the conditioning intensities. There was no fungi present in the samples collected during the storage period up to 90 days after dehydration, with less than 30 colony forming units found on plate counting. The use of mower conditioners in different intensities of injury did not speed up the dehydration time of Tifton 85...|$|E

5000|$|In 1979, an {{announcement}} was made that Badger Northland Incorporated of Kaukuana, a wholly owned subsidiary of Massey-Ferguson, would be purchased by Pedlar Industrial. Kirkland stated that this acquisition represented [...] "a logical extension of Pedlar Industrial activities in the agricultural equipment industry and reflects our continuing commitment to needs of the dairy and livestock farmers of North America." [...] Badger was known for manufacturing solid farm liquid manure handling systems, manure spreaders and <b>mower</b> <b>conditioners</b> for hay. It was later reported that an agreement between the two parties, Massey-Ferguson and Pedlar, could not be reached. Kirkland turned his interest to Quebec and purchased La Cie J.E. Jutras Inc. of Victoriaville and La Cie R.A. Lajoie Ltee of St. Pie de Bagot, both manufacturers of equipment for dairy and hog farmers. Kirkland's vision remained similar to what he stated {{when he tried to}} acquire the Massey Ferguson subsidiary; Pedlar would become the [...] "largest manufacturer of livestock equipment in Canada and in the top half-dozen in North America".|$|R
50|$|A {{conditioner}} {{is made up}} of two grooved rollers {{which the}} hay is forced through, causing the stalks to split, thus allowing the liquid trapped behind cell walls (sap and cell sap) to leak out and also giving more surface area for evaporation. The stand-alone conditioner is no longer used on most farms, since the conditioner has been incorporated into mower-conditioners, which combine the <b>mower</b> and <b>conditioner</b> into a single machine. The names Haybine and Discbine are brand names of mower-conditioners, although some farmers use these names somewhat generically.|$|R
