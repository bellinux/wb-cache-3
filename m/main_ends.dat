He was both a running threat and a receiver – his tall stature was well-suited to receiving – and helped complement a passing attack that featured the Browns' two <b>main</b> <b>ends,</b> Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie.

He had 312 rushing yards and 241 receiving yards in 1949, when the Browns won another AAFC championship.|$|E
60|$|Montesinos.--In feudal ages {{the object}} of those monarchs who had any {{determinate}} object in view was either to extend their dominions by conquest from their neighbours, or to increase their authority at home by breaking {{the power of a}} turbulent nobility. In commercial ages the great and sole object of government, when not engaged in war, was to augment its revenues, for the purpose of supporting the charges which former wars had induced, or which the apprehension of fresh ones rendered necessary. And thus it has been, that of the two <b>main</b> <b>ends</b> of government, which are the security of the subjects and the improvement of the nation, the latter has never been seriously attempted, scarcely indeed taken into consideration; and the former imperfectly attained.|$|E
60|$|There is, indeed, another sort, (a class {{they can}} {{scarcely}} be called), who are below self-interest; who {{live under the}} mastery of their senses and appetites; and whose selfishness is an animal instinct, a goad 'a tergo', not an attraction, 'a re prospecta', or (so to speak) from a projected self. In fact, such individuals cannot so properly {{be said to have}} a self, as to be machines for the self of nature: and are as little capable of loving themselves as of loving their neighbours. Such there are. Nay, (if we were to count only without weighing) the aggregate of such persons might possibly form a larger number than the class preceding. But they may safely be taken up into the latter, for the <b>main</b> <b>ends</b> of society, as being or sure to become its materials and tools. Their folly is the stuff in which the sound sense of the worldly-wise is at once manifested and remunerated; their idleness of thought, with the passions, appetites, likings and fancies, which are its natural growth, though weeds, give direction and employment to the industry of the other. The accidents of inheritance by birth, of accumulation of property in partial masses, are thus counteracted,--and the aneurisms in the circulating system prevented or rendered fewer and less obstinate,--whilst animal want, the sure general result of idleness and its accompanying vices, tames at length the selfish host, into the laborious slaves and mechanic implements of the self-interested. Thus, without public spirit, nay, by the predominance of the opposite quality, the latter are the public benefactors: and, giving steadfastness and compactness to the whole, lay in the ground of the canvass, on which minds of finer texture may impress beauty and harmony.|$|E

60|$|In Utopia {{there is}} no {{distinct}} and separate science of economics. Many problems that we should regard as economic come {{within the scope of}} Utopian psychology. My Utopians make two divisions of the science of psychology, first, the general psychology of individuals, a sort of mental physiology separated by no definite line from physiology proper, and secondly, the psychology of relationship between individuals. This second is an exhaustive study of the reaction of people upon each other and of all possible relationships. It is a science of human aggregations, of all possible family groupings, of neighbours and neighbourhood, of companies, associations, unions, secret and public societies, religious groupings, of common ends and intercourse, and of the methods of intercourse and collective decision that hold human groups together, and finally of government and the State. The elucidation of economic relationships, depending as it does {{on the nature of the}} hypothesis of human aggregation actually in operation at any time, is considered to be subordinate and subsequent to this general science of Sociology. Political economy and economics, in our world now, consist of a hopeless muddle of social assumptions and preposterous psychology, and a few geographical and physical generalisations. Its ingredients will be classified out and widely separated in Utopian thought. On the one hand there will be the study of physical economies, ending in the descriptive treatment of society as an organisation for the conversion of all the available energy in nature to the material ends of mankind--a physical sociology which will be already at such a stage of practical development as to be giving the world this token coinage representing energy--and on the other there will be the study of economic problems as problems in the division of labour, having regard to a social organisation whose <b>main</b> <b>ends</b> are reproduction and education in an atmosphere of personal freedom. Each of these inquiries, working unencumbered by the other, will be continually contributing fresh valid conclusions for the use of the practical administrator.|$|E

50|$|Traffic {{increased}} as further pits opened, and the corridor from Middle Engine Lane down to Percy Main became congested as companies either shared lines or built their own within {{a hundred yards}} of each other, depending on which was more convenient. Once they crossed {{the line of the}} present A193 Wallsend Road, they fanned out to their respective unloading points. In 1839 the Cramlington wagonway built a new line away from the corridor further to the west, while still passing close to it at the Middle Engine Lane and Percy <b>Main</b> <b>ends.</b> By the 1840s, coal was also coming from Blyth and Bedlington on the east coast, although this ceased after improvements to Blyth harbour in the 1880s.|$|E

40|$|The moral {{sensibility}} of the Greeks distinguished {{among three}} <b>main</b> <b>ends</b> of human action: Kalon (the beautiful), agaton (the good) and hedu (the pleasant). Plato first indicated that human {{life as a}} unity has a single end, which rejoins these three distinct characters. Aristotle developed this focal intuition in his idea of eudaimonia as complete end (telos teleion) of human life. This essay puts to question the coincidence between eudaimonia and particular ends and asks about {{the role played by}} virtue as an ingredient of eudaimonia. The analysis develops considering central passages in Plato’s Republic and Philebus, and the three ethic treatises of Aristotle...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of ductal disruption in pancreatic trauma {{is a major}} indicator of severity leading to higher morbidities and prolonged hospital stay. However, the adoption of early interventional approach in selected cases of documented grade III pancreatic trauma could result in shorter hospitalization and early recovery. We are describing our approach of early presentation-tailored interventions in managing two consecutive children diagnosed with grade III pancreatic injuries, which constitute the two <b>main</b> <b>ends</b> of the presentations’ spectrum. For the early presenter a spleen preserving distal pancreatectomy was performed, while for the late presenter with large symptomatic pseudocyst endoscopic drainage was attempted. Both early and late presenting children had quick and uneventful recoveries leading to 5 and 6 days of hospitalization, respectively. Both cases continued to be asymptomatic at 4 and 12 months post procedure. In the pseudocyst case, the gastro-cystostomy stents were removed after 10 weeks, and 2. 5 months later a completely healed pancreas was demonstrated by magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography. Unlike other abdominal solid organ injuries in children, adopting early presentation-tailored intervention {{can be associated with}} quicker recovery and short hospitalization for grade III pancreatic injuries. While the series is still small, achieving such remarkable outcomes in two consecutive cases is possible and could set a new trend in managing these injuries in children...|$|E

40|$|The {{successes of}} the recent robotic {{missions}} to Mars have generated a rising flood of data, and greatly enriched our factual knowledge of the red planet. The first successful robotic Mars mission (Mariner 4) was nearly 40 years ago and sent back only 21 black-and-white visual images. Taken together, current robotic Mars missions have been sending back during 2004 nearly that much per sol. The current rovers and orbiters can produce visual images in color and in greater resolution than ever before, as well as producing major amounts of non-image data (such as from thermometers, magnetometers, radars, spectrometers, etc.). How much data have been received is summarized in this report. The incoming data from Mars have been and are being archived for later analysis. But these data are also stimulating some currently done analysis toward two <b>main</b> <b>ends.</b> One is the on-going direction of the mission. The other is preliminary analyses for status reports on the “science ” or “findings ” {{that relate to the}} formal mission objectives. More detail will be forthcoming for the current missions in the final project reports and in some technical papers that the project science and engineering personnel will tender for publication. What is greatly underfunded are full and detailed analyses not just of the data from any one mission, but those data in relation to the data from other missions. We have to ask how much knowledge awaits discovery in the rising flood of data from Mars...|$|E
