40|$|Variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) typing with a {{panel of}} 24 loci is the current gold {{standard}} in the molecular typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates. However, because of technical problems, {{a part of the}} loci often cannot be amplified by multiplex PCRs. Therefore, a considerable number of single-locus PCRs have to be performed for the loci with missing results, which impairs the laboratory work flow. Therefore, the original in-house method described by Supply et al. in 2006 was reevaluated. We modified seven primers and the PCR <b>master</b> <b>mixture</b> and obtained a strongly optimized in-house 24 -locus VNTR typing method. The percentage of instantly complete 24 -locus VNTR patterns detected in the routine flow of typing activities increased to 84. 7 % from the 72. 3 % obtained with the typing conducted with the commercially available Genoscreen MIRU-VNTR typing kit. The analytical sensitivity of the optimized in-house method was assessed by serial dilutions of M. tuberculosis in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. A 1 : 10 dilution of the different strains tested was the lowest dilution for the detection of a complete 24 -locus VNTR pattern. The optimized in-house 24 -locus VNTR typing method will reduce the turnaround time of typing significantly and also the financial burden of these activities...|$|E
40|$|We found 73. 1 to 96. 9 % {{similarity}} by aligning the cytolytic enterotoxin gene of Aeromonas hydrophila SSU (AHCYTOEN; GenBank accession no. M 84709) against aerolysin {{genes of}} Aeromonas spp., suggesting {{the possibility of}} selecting common primers. Identities of 90 to 100 % were found among the eight selected primers from those genes. Amplicons obtained from Aeromonas sp. reference strains by using specific primers for each gene or a cocktail of primers were 232 bp long. Of hybridization group 4 / 5 A/ 5 B (HG 4 / 5 A/ 5 B), HG 9, and HG 12 or non-Aeromonas reference strains, none were positive. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) with HpaII yielded three types of patterns. PCR-RFLP 1 contained two fragments (66 and 166 bp) found in HG 6, HG 7, HG 8, HG 10, and HG 11. PCR-RFLP 2 contained three fragments (18, 66, and 148 bp) found in HG 1, HG 2, HG 3, and HG 11. PCR-RFLP 3, with four fragments (7, 20, 66, and 139 bp), was observed only in HG 13. PCR-amplicon sequence analysis (PCR-ASA) revealed three main types. PCR-ASA 1 had 76 to 78 % homology with AHCYTOEN and included strains in HG 6, HG 7, HG 8, HG 10, and HG 11. PCR-ASA 2, with 82 % homology, was found only in HG 13. PCR-ASA 3, with 91 to 99 % homology, contained the strains in HG 1, HG 2, HG 3, and HG 11. This method indicated that 37 (61 %) of the 61 reference strains were positive with the primer cocktail <b>master</b> <b>mixture,</b> and 34 (58 %) of 59 environmental isolates, 93 (66 %) of 141 food isolates, and 100 (67 %) of 150 clinical isolates {{from around the world}} carried a virulence factor when primers AHCF 1 and AHCR 1 were used. In conclusion, this PCR-based method is rapid, sensitive, and specific for the detection of virulence factors of Aeromonas spp. It overcomes the handicap of time-consuming biochemical and other DNA-based methods...|$|E
30|$|Plasma miR {{extraction}} and RT-qPCR {{analysis was}} conducted as previously reported [22, 29]. Briefly, two replicates of 170  µL of plasma were thawed, mixed with 5 volumes of Qiazol lysis reagent and vortexed. For one patient, 500  µL plasma pre and post treatment was used to extract miRs for a broader analysis of 379 miRs in an array format. The miRs were extracted with chloroform and the aqueous phase was further processed using the miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). MiRs were converted to cDNA using the miScript II RT kit (Qiagen Valencia, CA, cat. # 218160). This kit contains a miScript HiSpec buffer MiR to enable either mature miRNA profiling (using miScript miRNA PCR Arrays) or mature miRNA quantification using individual miScript Primer Assays. In this reverse transcription reaction with miScript HiSpec Buffer, mature miRNAs are polyadenylated by poly(A) polymerase and converted into cDNA by reverse transcriptase with oligo-dT priming. The cDNA is then used for real-time PCR quantification of mature miRNA expression. MiR expression was quantified by qRT-PCR, using the SYBR green PCR <b>Master</b> <b>mixture</b> (Qiagen cat. # 218073) in an ABI 7900 HT Real-Time PCR system using (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with 95  °C for 15  min followed by 40 cycles (94  °C for 15  s, 55  °C for 30  s and 72  °C for 30  s) followed by a melting curve step to evaluate specificity of amplification. A broad miR expression array (379 miRs + U 6) was performed for global miR profiling using one randomly selected patient (# 101) that required 500  µL plasma at baseline and post dovitinib treatment (Qiagen Valencia, CA). The miR expression values from the array were normalized to the mean expression level of all miRs in the respective sample, to adjust for the different quality of RNA preservation and extraction. MiR specific primers {{were used for the}} panel of six miRs selected for further study (Qiagen Valencia, CA). Expression values were calculated using the comparative Ct method. Levels of a panel of six selected signature of miRs were measured in the plasma of eight patients before and after treatment and normalized to U 6 levels [30, 31]. The data was processed with Prism 5.0 Graphpad software for t test analysis and the display of data. Reproducibility of the miRNA assays within and across studies supports that these assays are specific for mature miRNAs, as also claimed by the manufacturer.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Pelchem, a {{commercial}} subsidiary of Necsa (South African Nuclear Energy Corporation), produces {{a range of}} commercial fluorocarbon products while driving research and development initiatives to support the fluorine product portfolio. One such initiative is to develop improved analytical techniques to analyse product composition during development and to quality assure produce. Generally the C–F type products produced by Necsa are in a solution of anhydrous HF, and cannot be directly analyzed with traditional techniques without derivatisation. A technique such as vibrational spectroscopy, that can analyze these products directly without further preparation, will have a distinct advantage. However, spectra of mixtures of similar compounds are complex and not suitable for traditional quantitative regression analysis. Multivariate data analysis (MVA) {{can be used in}} such instances to exploit the complex nature of spectra to extract quantitative information on the composition of mixtures. A selection of fluorocarbon alcohols was made to act as representatives for fluorocarbon compounds. Experimental design theory was used to create a calibration range of mixtures of these compounds. Raman and infrared (NIR and ATR–IR) spectroscopy were used to generate spectral data of the mixtures and this data was analyzed with MVA techniques by the construction of regression and prediction models. Selected samples from the mixture range were chosen to test the predictive ability of the models. Analysis and regression models (PCR, PLS 2 and PLS 1) gave good model fits (R 2 values larger than 0. 9). Raman spectroscopy was the most efficient technique and gave a high prediction accuracy (at 10 % accepted standard deviation), provided the minimum mass of a component exceeded 16 % of the total sample. The infrared techniques also performed well in terms of fit and prediction. The NIR spectra were subjected to signal saturation as a result of using long path length sample cells. This was shown to be the main reason for the loss in efficiency of this technique compared to Raman and ATR–IR spectroscopy. It was shown that multivariate data analysis of spectroscopic data of the selected fluorocarbon compounds could be used to quantitatively analyse mixtures with the possibility of further optimization of the method. The study was a representative study indicating that the combination of MVA and spectroscopy can be used successfully in the quantitative analysis of other fluorocarbon compound <b>mixtures.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R
6000|$|One of {{the most}} popular of American humorists has {{elicited}} from a member of an English audience, who did not quite hear him lecture, a remark of an amusing sort. The aggrieved listener proclaimed that he [...] "had a right to hear." [...] This was one of the turbulent people who should read Mazzini, and learn that man has no rights worth mentioning--only duties, one of which is to hold his tongue in season. If Mr. Bret Harte's words did not reach all his audience, his writings at least have come home to most English readers. They suggest a consideration of the many points of difference which distinguish American from English humour. The Americans are of our own stock, yet in their treatment of the ludicrous how unlike us they are! As far as fun goes, the race has certainly become [...] "differentiated," [...] as the philosophers say, {{on the other side of}} the Atlantic. It does not seem probable that the infusion of alien blood has caused the difference. The native redskin can claim few descendants among the civilized Americans, and the native redskin had no sense of humour. We all remember Cooper's Hawk-eye or Leather Stocking, with his [...] "peculiar silent laugh." [...] He was obliged to laugh silently for fear of attracting the unfavourable notice of the Mingo, who might be hiding in the nearest bush. The red men found it simpler and safer not to laugh at all. No, it is not from the natives that the people of the States get their peculiar fun. As to the German emigrants--But why pursue the subject? The Abbe Bouhours told the bitter truth about German wit, though, in new conditions and on a fresh soil, the Teuton has helped to produce Hans Breitmann. We laugh at Hans, however, and with his creator. Hans does not make us laugh by conscious efforts of humour. Whence, then, come Artemus Ward, Mark Twain, and Mr. Bret Harte, who are probably the American humorists whose popularity is widest? Mr. Bret Harte's own fun is much more English and less thoroughly Yankee than that of his contemporaries. He is a disciple of Thackeray and Dickens. Of all the pupils of Dickens he is perhaps the only one who has continued to be himself, who has not fallen into a trick of aping his <b>master's</b> mannerisms. His <b>mixture</b> of the serious, the earnest, the pathetic, makes his humour not unlike the melancholy mirth of Thackeray and Sterne. He is almost the only American humorist with sentiment. It is only the air, not the spirit, that is changed--coelum non animus.|$|R
40|$|Powder compact forging {{was used}} to produce Ti and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V rocker arms using {{pre-alloyed}} and blended elemental powders. Green powder compacts with high relative density were manufactured by warm compaction. Due to the characteristics of raw powders, interlocking and cold welding are the main mechanisms for HDH powder compaction, while warm welding is the main mechanism for GA powder compaction. During induction heating of the powder compact, {{it was found that}} necks formed extensively in as-sintered HDH Ti powder compact, leading to an average elongation to fracture of 7. 5 %, whereas necks did not form so extensively in as-sintered HDH Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and GA Ti- 6 Al- 4 V powder compacts, which make them brittle due to their low relative density. As a rapid consolidation process, the densification rate was enhanced by powder compact forging due to pore collapsing caused by material flow driven by a large amount of localized plastic deformation. The degree of powder consolidation of powder compact forging using HDH Ti, HDH and GA Ti- 6 Al- 4 V powders were studied by characterising their porosity distributions, microstructure, mechanical properties and fracture behaviour. Due to the positive effect of shear deformation on the powder consolidation of powder compact forging, the powder compact in the centre of forged parts were consolidated completely with full density and had better mechanical properties than those from ingot metallurgy. The effects of heat treatments on microstructure and mechanical properties of as-forged HDH Ti part, HDH and GA Ti- 6 Al- 4 V parts were investigated, and the ductility of forged HDH Ti part was improved significantly by annealing treatment. Recrystallization annealing was {{regarded as one of the}} best heat treatments to achieve the high ductility of as-forged HDH and GA Ti- 6 Al- 4 V parts, which can open the applications of forged HDH Ti- 6 Al- 4 V part with high oxygen content (~ 0. 5 %). The mechanical properties of forged HDH and GA Ti- 6 Al- 4 V parts after solution and aging treatment and recrystallization annealing were much better than those from both the ones from reported pre-alloyed approaches and wrought parts, which were caused by the enhancement of powder consolidation during recrystallization process. Blended elemental approach and mechanical alloying method were applied to produce Ti- 6 Al- 4 V rocker arm by powder compact forging at 1350 oC. The effect of holding time at forging temperature on the samples produced by forging the compact of HDH Ti/Al-V <b>master</b> alloy powder <b>mixture</b> was studied, and it was found that a holding time of 5 - 10 minutes at forging temperature is required to get the as-forged part with good mechanical properties and homogeneous microstructure of free undissolved master alloy powders. Also, in order to reduce the holding time for achieving composition homogeneity, the powder mixture of Ti and Al-V master alloy powders was milled to produce Ti/Al- 40 wt%V composite powder. With such composite powder, the master alloy layers/particles were dissolved rapidly into Ti matrix, but the oxygen pick up during milling and powder passivation make the mechanical properties of the forged samples inferior to those of the parts made by powder compact forging of the powder mixture or pre-alloyed powder...|$|R
