30|$|A {{series of}} static load tests {{were carried out}} to assess the {{strength}} of an anchor and evaluate its behavior, {{as well as that}} of the wedge, strand, and strand-wedge connection. The test was conducted according to the Korean specification, KCI-PS 101, which is a part of the Appendix of KCI (2010). This is similar to ETAG 013 (EOTA 2002). After pre-jacking at about 10 to 15 % of the <b>minimum</b> ultimate <b>tensile</b> strength (MUTS), displacement gauges were installed. Then, tensile loading was increased up to 80 % of the MUTS of the strand.|$|R

In the push-in test, the loading procedure was stopped for some specimens due to safety concerns, but all the anchors endured at least 1.18 times the nominal ultimate strength of the strand before the test was stopped or the anchor failed. The jacking test reflected the real-world condition, {{but there was no}} strand fracture under the maximum loading force of the jacking device, which was larger than the <b>minimum</b> ultimate <b>tensile</b> strength.|$|R

Higher strength gray irons, up to class 40, have lower carbon equivalents and a pearlite matrix. Gray iron above class 40 requires alloying to provide solid solution strengthening, and heat treating is used to modify the matrix. Class 80 is the highest class available, but it is extremely brittle. ASTM A247 is also commonly used to describe the graphite structure.

The parameters influencing the tensile surface stresses in a FGM consisting of a soft surface layer, a stiff base material and a graded region between them have been investigated by finite element analysis and an optimum is reported for the first time.

50|$|The {{adhesion}} of a coating {{or several}} coated sample of any paint product {{is measured by}} assessing the <b>minimum</b> <b>tensile</b> stress needed to detach or rupture the coating perpendicular to the substrate. Unlike the other methods, this method maximizes the tensile stress, therefore results may not be comparable to the others. The test is done by securing loading fixtures (dollies) perpendicular {{to the surface of}} a coating with an adhesive. Then the testing apparatus is attached to the loading fixture and is then aligned to apply tension perpendicular to the test surface. The force that is applied gradually increases and is monitored until a plug of coating is detached, or a previously specified value is reached.|$|E
50|$|Accelerated curing {{techniques}} invariably involve high temperatures. This {{may induce}} thermal stresses in the concrete. Further, {{the water in}} the pores starts to exert pressure at higher temperatures. The combined effect of the pore pressure and thermal stresses causes a tensile stress within the body of the concrete. If the accelerated curing process is begun immediately after the concrete has been poured, then the concrete {{will not be able to}} withstand the tensile stresses as it requires time to gain some strength. Moreover, these microcracks formed may then lead to the delayed formation of ettringite, which is formed by the transformation of metastable monosulfate. Delayed ettringite formation (DEF) induces expansion in the concrete thereby weakening it. DEF is promoted by the formation of the cracks which enables the easy entry of water. Therefore, a delay period is allowed to elapse before the commencement of the curing process to allow the concrete to gain a certain <b>minimum</b> <b>tensile</b> strength. The setting time of the concrete is an important criterion to determine the delay period. Generally, the delay period is equal to the initial setting time which has been found to give satisfactory results. Lesser delay periods result in compressive strength losses.|$|E
50|$|The numbers {{stamped on}} the head of the bolt are {{referred}} to the grade of the bolt used in certain application with the strength of a bolt. High-strength steel bolts usually have a hexagonal head with an ISO strength rating (called property class) stamped {{on the head}}. And the absence of marking/number indicates a lower grade bolt with low strength. The property classes most often used are 5.8, 8.8, and 10.9. The number before the point is the ultimate tensile strength in MPa divided by 100. The number after the point is the multiplier ratio of yield strength to ultimate tensile strength. For example, a property class 5.8 bolt has a nominal (<b>minimum)</b> ultimate <b>tensile</b> strength of 500 MPa, and a tensile yield strength of 0.8 times ultimate tensile strength or 0.8(500) = 400 MPa.|$|R

30|$|The {{survival}} at 1 A.U. of a {{spherical particle}} having a 5 μm diameter {{and a potential}} of 10 volts requires a <b>minimum</b> <b>tensile</b> strength of ~ 150 N/m 2 to avoid breakup under Solar UV irradiation. Overall the collection of 5 to 10 μm CP IDPs that survived in space at 1 A.U. demonstrates that the <b>minimum</b> <b>tensile</b> strength of the organic grain coatings must be ~ 150 to 325 N/m 2 if the grains are spherical. The 2.5 μm diameter CP IDPs, observed on the collectors, but less well studied {{because they are more}} difficult to manipulate and section, require an even greater <b>minimum</b> <b>tensile</b> strength, from 500 to 1200 N/m 2 (Fig. 5), for charges from 10 to 15 volts.

30|$|Fracture {{gradient}} {{is defined}} by the Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary as the pressure gradient required to induce fractures in the rock at a given depth. Based on this definition, the fracture gradient is the maximum mud weight that a well can hold without mud losses and without uncontrolled tensile failures (fracture growth). However, there is no consensus for a method to calculate the fracture gradient in the oil and gas industry. Some pore pressure specialists use the minimum stress gradient as the fracture gradient, but others may use the maximum leak-off pressure gradient (fracture breakdown pressure gradient) or the fracture initiation pressure gradient as the fracture gradient. In this paper, the maximum leak-off pressure gradient (the peak value in the LOT test) is used as the fracture gradient. That is, the effects of the <b>minimum</b> stress, <b>tensile</b> strength, and the wellbore stress concentrations will be considered for fracture gradient prediction.|$|R

The investigated material was taken from a pipeline with circumferential welded joint after 419 988 hours of service at the temperature of 490 °C, steam pressure 8 MPa. Performed research has shown that the 12 HMF steel after service was characterized by a typical microstructure for this grade of steel, that is a ferritic-bainitic microstructure without any visible advanced processes of its degradation. The investigation of mechanical properties has shown that the examined steel after service was characterized by a very low impact energy KV, and yield strength lower than the required <b>minimum.</b> Whilst <b>tensile</b> strength and yield strength determined at elevated temperature was higher and similar to the standard requirements, respectively.

40|$|Optimum {{bitumen content}} {{determination}} {{is one of}} the major aims for foamed bitumen mix design. However, mix design procedures for foamed bitumen mixes are still under development. In this paper a method to determine the optimum bitumen content for given foamed bitumen mix based on primary aggregate structure porosity and indirect tensile strength criterion is proposed. Using packing theory concepts, the aggregate gradation is divided into three aggregate structures which are oversize, primary and secondary structures. Porosity for the primary aggregate structure is determined for given bitumen contents. A maximum value for porosity of 50 % for the primary aggregate structure is used to choose initial bitumen content. Furthermore, a <b>minimum</b> indirect <b>tensile</b> strength criteria is suggested to refine this bitumen content. This method enables a bitumen content value to be chosen prior to the start of experimental work, as porosity is expressed in terms of physical parameters such as aggregate and binder specific gravity, and aggregate gradation which are known before the mix design process. The bitumen content is then later refined when the indirect tensile strength is determined in the laboratory. This method would reduce resources such as time and materials that may be required during the mix design procedure...|$|R

30|$|Unlike the {{situation}} for survival under the dynamic pressure of atmospheric deceleration, where the largest particles that survive experience the highest pressure, the observation of survival under solar radiation charging requires higher tensile strength for the smallest particles. The <b>minimum</b> <b>tensile</b> strength of the particle, {{the strength of the}} organic coating that connects the individual mineral grains to each other, can be modeled. Solar UV bombardment results in spherical particles near 1 A.U. acquiring a positive charge of ~ 5 volts by photoelectric emission of electrons (Horanyi, 1996), while modeling including the specific parameters for olivine, a major mineral component in the CP IDPs, indicate that silicate particles acquire a positive charge of 4 to 14 volts at 1 A.U.

Paving units consist of two layers. Four mixes were cast. The first mix was the control mix, in which Portland cement was used in the two layers. In the second mix, Portland slag cement was used in the upper layer, Portland cement was used in the backing layer. In the third mix, Portland cement was placed in the upper layer, while Portland slag cement was used in the backing layer. Finally, in the fourth mix, Portland cement was fully replaced by Portland slag cement in both layers. Tests were carried out in order to investigate the properties of the manufactured specimens at ages 28 and 180 days, respectively.
