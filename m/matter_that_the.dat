5|$|On 13–14 May, the Germans were vulnerable. A strong {{attack at}} this point by the French {{armoured}} units could have prevented Guderian from breaking out of the Meuse bridgeheads and changed {{the outcome of the}} campaign. However, the French commanders, already deeply schooled and versed in the rather staunchly defensively-focused broad, generalized doctrine of methodological warfare, were located far to the rear, which meant they lacked a real-time and up-to-date picture of the battle. When intelligence did filter through, it was out-of-date. This was to prove fatal, especially coupled with the case of the <b>matter</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> French generalship at large was expecting a considerably more prolonged process of initial German assault phase and overall attack effort as a whole.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 2009, CIA Director Leon Panetta {{told the}} Senate and House {{intelligence}} committees that the CIA withheld {{information about a}} secret counter-terrorism program from Congress for eight years on direct orders from Cheney. Intelligence and Congressional officials have said the unidentified program did not involve the CIA interrogation program and did not involve domestic intelligence activities. They have said the program was started by the counter-terrorism center at the CIA shortly after the attacks of September 11, 2001, but never became fully operational, involving planning and some training that took place off and on from 2001 until this year. The Wall Street Journal reported, citing former intelligence officials familiar with the <b>matter,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> program {{was an attempt to}} carry out a 2001 presidential authorization to capture or kill al Qaeda operatives.|$|E

Studies of diet {{have been made in}} most parts of the bird's range, and in moist temperate areas over 90% of the prey tends to be small mammals, whereas in hot, dry, unproductive areas, the proportion is lower, and a great variety of other creatures are eaten depending on local abundance. Most prey is terrestrial but bats and birds are also taken, as well as lizards, amphibians and insects. Even when they are plentiful and other prey scarce, earthworms do not seem to be consumed.|$|E

When a scrutiny is conducted, the election judge may order a vote to be struck off if the voter was not on the register of electors assigned to the polling station at which the vote was recorded or was not authorized to vote at the station; if the vote was obtained by bribery, treating or undue influence; if the voter committed or induced someone to commit the offence of personation; and if the vote was for a disqualified candidate and the disqualification was either a <b>matter</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> voter was aware of or was sufficiently publicized or widely known. During a scrutiny, a tendered vote that is shown to be valid will be added to the poll if any party to the proceedings asks for the vote to be added. On the other hand, a registered elector's vote will not be struck off at a scrutiny just because he or she was not qualified to be on the electoral register, and the returning officer's decision {{as to whether or not}} a ballot paper should be rejected may not be questioned.|$|E

500|$|Spielberg {{devised the}} three trials that guard the Grail.

For the second trial, in which Indiana spells [...] "Iehova" [...] on stable stepping stones, {{it was intended to}} have a tarantula crawl up Indiana after he mistakenly steps on [...] "J". This was filmed and deemed unsatisfactory, so ILM filmed a stuntman hanging through a hole that appears in the floor, 30 feet above a cavern.

500|$|Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games was a {{commercial}} success; {{in the first}} few months after its release, the game was on four separate occasions the top-selling game in the United Kingdom all-formats chart. It accumulated seven weeks as the number-one seller, including the first two weeks after its release. The Wii version sold a half-million units in the UK during those seven weeks. By June 2008, both Wii and DS versions reached combined sales of 1.2million copies in the UK, prompting Sega to create plans on re-marketing the game there. The game went on to sell over two million units combined in the country. According to the NPD Group, the Wii game was one of the top-ten best-sellers for the month of December 2007 in the United States, selling 613,000 units. Electronic Entertainment Design and Research analyst Jesse Divnich argued the game is a fitting example of brand awareness' role in determining Wii game sales. The Wii is an exception to the correlation that higher quality games lead to better sales as seen on the Xbox 360 and Sony's PlayStation 3. Divnich added [...] "To the casual and social gamer, it didn't <b>matter</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game received sub-70 Metacritic scores," [...] the recognizable [...] "Mario" [...] and [...] "Sonic" [...] brand names participating in a recognizable action, [...] "The Olympic Games," [...] contributed to the game's US sales.|$|E

[...] By contrast, IGN reviewer Levi Buchanan noted the Game Gear's biggest fault was its game library when compared to the Game Boy, stating that [...] "the software was completely lacking compared to its chief rival, which was bathed in quality games. It didn't <b>matter</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Game Gear was more powerful. The color screen did not reverse any fortunes. Content and innovation beat out technology, a formula that Nintendo is using right now with the continued ascendance of the DS and Wii." [...] Buchanan later went on to praise some parts of the Game Gear's library, however, stating [...] "Some of those Master System tweaks were very good games, and fun is resilient against time." [...] Retro Gamer praised Sega's accomplishment in surviving against the competition of Nintendo in the handheld console market with the Game Gear, noting that [...] "for all the handhelds that have gone up against the might of Nintendo and ultimately lost out, Sega's Game Gear managed to last the longest, only outdone in sales by the Sony PSP.

[...] Chris Richards of The Washington Post said that it was a [...] "one of those rare, thrilling, upside-down pop concerts", because Mars did not try to recreate the gleam of his most successful tracks, instead he reshaped the songbook at his will, which Richards found amazing. The reviewer also mentioned the wide ranges of genres that Mars approached, including [...] "Motown, new wave, late-’70s funk, mid-’90s R" [...] influenced by pop, which earned him various generations of admirers and fans. However, he criticized the singer for not claiming his own personality through all the [...] "genre-jumping time travel" [...] and for not adding the band name, The Hooligans, on the ticket, as well. Jim Farber from the New York Daily News praised the concert as it tried to recreate the 70's era regarding its entertainment. The reviewer compared it to some acts of that period such as The Jacksons, The Tramps and The Bee Gees. He enlightened Mars' voice matching its [...] "purity, cream and range" [...] to the [...] "mid-period Michael Jackson".
