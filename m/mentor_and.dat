40|$|Abstract. Existing online mentorship systems {{typically}} match <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> mentees manually. Recommender {{systems can}} be used to match <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> mentees and trust and reputation mechanisms {{can be used to}} improve the decision process. This paper discusses the state-of-the-art in online mentorship systems, recommender systems, and trust and reputation mechanisms. It further proposes a five-stage process for automatic matching groups of <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> mentees in online mentorship systems...|$|R

50|$|The {{frequency}} with which peer <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> mentees meet varies according to the particular mentoring program. Some pairs may make contact once a month, while others may meet 3-4 times per month or more. It is usually advised that <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> mentees meet more often {{in the beginning of}} the relationship in order to establish a good foundation. <b>Mentors</b> <b>and</b> mentees may maintain contact through email, telephone or in-person meetings. Peer mentoring organizations may also set up social events for those participating in the program. These events provide good opportunities for increased social interaction between <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> mentees.|$|R
40|$|This {{comparative}} {{case study}} features six types of <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> coaching: <b>mentors</b> of young people; mentors of leaders; mentors of newly qualified teachers; executive coaches; coaching psychologists; sports coaches. Three practitioners {{from each of}} these disciplines were interviewed to identify if there were shared and distinctive approaches between <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> coaching. Participants shared how their approaches might be transferable to other types of <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> coaching. Findings suggest that practitioners should be supported to specialise in a specific mentoring or coaching discipline; adopt a mentor-coach interdisciplinary approach; or to develop multidisciplinary approaches. Further research is needed which takes into consideration additional types of <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> coaching...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{two types}} of leadership mentoring behaviors: career <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> psychosocial <b>mentoring.</b> First, factor analysis was conducted to confirm the two factor solution.

Finally, this study also tested the moderating effect of two cultural factors, assertiveness and power distance. It is found that leaders' career <b>and</b> psychosocial <b>mentoring</b> were both positively related to subordinate motivation across 38 countries. The relationship between leaders' career <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> subordinate motivation was stronger in high assertiveness cultures, whereas the relationship between leaders' psychosocial <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> subordinate motivation was weaker in high assertiveness cultures. Moreover, the relationship between leaders' career <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> subordinate motivation was weaker in high power distance cultures...|$|R
40|$|M. Comm. Due to skills {{shortages}} {{brought about}} by various factors, the study seeks to determine and quantify the perceived importance of <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> coaching leaders in the workplace. For {{the purpose of this}} study, leadership and management are viewed as not being mutually exclusive. Management’s perceptions and attitudes toward skills development are also examined <b>and</b> various <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> coaching models are discussed. The scope of the research is confined to the Gauteng Department of Economic Development (GDED) and the research study is targeted at middle and senior management. The research study takes place during a period of organisational transformation within the GDED. This is a quantitative study and was undertaken by means of questionnaire design as a research instrument. <b>Mentoring</b> <b>and</b> coaching as a talent management mechanism as well as a strategy to retain skilled employees in an organisation is gaining momentum globally. As older and more experienced employees retire from the labour force, skills and knowledge transfer to younger employees becomes critical to ensure sustainability in organisations. <b>Mentoring</b> <b>and</b> coaching is thus an option to ensure that skills and knowledge are not lost due to an increasing number of workers retiring. Within the context of <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> coaching a number of factors are examined which could influence the <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> coaching experience. These factors include, {{but are not limited to}} issues around race, gender, ethnicity and cultural differences. Literature suggests that these are critical factors which influence the outcome of <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> coaching relationships. The perceptions around race, gender, ethnicity and cultural differences within the context of the <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> coaching experience are discussed and its significance is quantified in the research. The finding from the questionnaires are presented and discussed in the research study followed by recommendations and conclusions...|$|R
