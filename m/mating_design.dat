5000|$|<b>Mating</b> <b>design</b> is a {{schematic}} cross {{between the groups}} or strains of plants are made in a plant breeding that is common in agriculture and biological science. The <b>mating</b> <b>design</b> in plant breeding has two main objectives: (1) to obtain information and understand the genetic control of a trait or behavior that is observed, and (2) to get the base population {{for the development of}} plant cultivars. [...] Analysis of variance in offspring plants results from a <b>mating</b> <b>design</b> was used to evaluate the effects of additive genetic, dominant level, epistasis and heritability value equal to the value of genetic expectations.|$|E
50|$|In Fig. 1 a {{connected}} {{variant of}} DPM is shown. DPM is an efficient <b>mating</b> <b>design</b> in balanced breeding programmes, where equal contribution from each breeding population member is desired. With DPM {{the number of}} new families created is equal to the number of individuals mated. DPM allows to efficiently utilise positive assortative mating for more efficient use of the breeding population members for deployment to seed orchards. In comparison with single pair mating, DPM has the advantages that the genes from the individual are transmitted to next generation even if one of the crosses fails; that safer estimates of breeding values of the parents get possible (useful for seed orchards, where tested trees are preferred); and that genes from different ancestors have a better chance to combine.|$|E
50|$|A genetically {{variable}} {{population and}} {{a method of}} selecting genetically superior individuals {{provide the basis for}} tree improvement by breeding. In essence, a tree improvement program sets out to isolate and evaluate the genetic component of variation in one or more characters of interest. In the simplest procedure, cycles of selection reduce the available population in a particular direction to enhance desirable traits, then breeding from selections to expand the population with improved characteristics. Breeding strategies vary with species and objectives, but all use mating designs to generate information and new material. Choice of a suitable breeding strategy and <b>mating</b> <b>design</b> is a key decision in any breeding program. Kiss (1986) used a 2-level design in British Columbia to study variation within and between separate populations of white spruce, both within British Columbia and from eastern North America.|$|E

40|$|Full {{factorial}} breeding {{designs are}} useful for quantifying the amount of additive genetic, nonadditive genetic, and maternal variance that explain phenotypic traits. Such variance estimates are important for examining evolutionary potential. Traditionally, full factorial <b>mating</b> <b>designs</b> have been analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance, which may produce negative variance values and is not suited for unbalanced designs. Mixed-effects models do not produce negative variance values and are suited for unbalanced designs. However, extracting the variance components, calculating significance values, and estimating confidence intervals and/or power values for the components are not straightforward using traditional analytic methods. We introduce fullfact – an R package that addresses these issues and facilitates the analysis of full factorial <b>mating</b> <b>designs</b> with mixed-effects models. Here, we summarize {{the functions of the}} fullfact package. The observed data functions extract the variance explained by random and fixed effects and provide their significance. We then calculate the additive genetic, nonadditive genetic, and maternal variance components explaining the phenotype. In particular, we integrate nonnormal error structures for estimating these components for nonnormal data types. The resampled data functions are used to produce bootstrap-t confidence intervals, which can then be plotted using a simple function. We explore the fullfact package through a worked example. This package will facilitate the analyses of full factorial <b>mating</b> <b>designs</b> in R, especially for the analysis of binary, proportion, and/or count data types and for the ability to incorporate additional random and fixed effects and power analyses...|$|R

30|$|The {{prediction}} accuracy {{was estimated}} by standardizing the prediction ability with the square root of heritability estimates to compare our findings across market segments {{and also with}} other studies. Prediction accuracies were comparable for segment LS and MM but lower for segment SS (Fig.  3). This difference {{can be explained by}} a smaller population size (Additional file 1 : Table S 2) in combination with a more unbalanced factorial <b>mating</b> <b>design</b> (Additional file 1 : Figure S 4) for segment SS than LS and MM. Zhao et al. (2015) have shown using a resampling strategy based on 1, 604 wheat hybrids that both the number of parents used in the factorial <b>mating</b> <b>design</b> and the balanced representation of parental lines used to generate hybrids are important factors driving the prediction accuracy.|$|E
40|$|Selection in {{dairy cattle}} populations usually {{takes into account}} both the breed {{profiles}} for many traits and their overall estimated breeding values (EBV). This can result in effective contributions of breeding animals departing substantially from contributions optimised for saving future genetic variability. In this work, we propose a mating method that considers not only inbreeding but also the detailed EBV of progeny or the EBV of sires in reference to acceptance thresholds. Penalties were defined for inbreeding and for inadequate EBV profiles. Relative reductions of penalties yielded by any <b>mating</b> <b>design</b> were expressed on a scale ranging from 0 to 1. A value of 0 represented the average performance of random matings and a value of 1 represented the maximal reduction allowed by a specialized, single-penalty, <b>mating</b> <b>design.</b> The core of the method was an adaptative simulated annealing, where the maximized function was the average of both ratios, under the constraints that both relative penalty reductions should be equal and that the within-herd concentration criterion should be equal to a predefined reasonable value. The method was tested on two French dairy cattle populations originating from the same AI organization. The optimised <b>mating</b> <b>design</b> allowed substantial reductions of penalty: 70 % and 64 % for the Holstein and the Normandy populations, respectively. Thus, this mating method decreased inbreeding and met various demands from breeders. </p...|$|E
40|$|Improvements in the {{usefulness}} of QTL analysis arise from better statistical methods applied to the problem, ability to analyze more complex <b>mating</b> <b>designs,</b> and the fitting of less simplified genetic models. Here we review the advantages of different plant <b>mating</b> <b>designs</b> in QTL analysis and conclude that diallel designs have several favorable properties. We then turn to the detection of systematic genome-wide synergistic epistasis. This form of epistasis has important implications from evolutionary (maintenance of sexual reproduction and concealment of cryptic genetic variation) and practical perspectives (response to pyramided favorable alleles). We develop two methods for detecting systematic synergistic epistasis, one based on analyzing interactions between locus effects and predicted individual genotypic values and one based on analyzing pairwise locus interactions. Using the first method we detect synergistic epistasis in a barley and a wheat dataset {{but not in a}} maize dataset. We fail to detect synergistic epistasis with the second method. We discuss our results in the light of theoretical questions concerning the mechanisms of synergistic epistasis...|$|R

The MAGIC approach can be adopted to build pre-breeding populations accessible to breeding programs. Although more time and efforts may be required to develop multiple MAGIC populations, the potential benefits are large. Relative to bi-parental populations, MAGIC populations will have greater genotypic diversity, a higher level of recombination, and reduced linkage drag. Because of these advantages, the MAGIC approach has been applied to many crop and plant species for genetic research and breeding (Huang et al. 2015).

40|$|Female mate choice {{decisions}} are {{often based on}} a variety of male characteristics, some of which may reflect male quality via condition-dependent trait expression. Here, we explore the condition dependence of a male secondary sexual trait in a wolf spider and examine its influence on female mate choice. In the wolf spider Schizocosa uetzi, mature males possess a multimodal courtship display (visual + seismic) in which they slowly raise and lower their dark colored forelegs. Foreleg color is highly variable among S. uetzi males with respect to both total amount and darkness. Using diet manipulations in conjunction with color quantifications, we demonstrate condition-dependent foreleg color. High-nutrient diet males had significantly higher body condition indices and possessed more and darker foreleg color than low-nutrient diet males. However, using multiple <b>mate</b> choice <b>designs,</b> we were unable to demonstrate a female preference for male foreleg color. Using both single and 2 -choice <b>mating</b> <b>designs</b> as well as using females from a range of ages, we found that copulation success was consistently independent of male foreleg color. Instead, we found courtship intensity to be the only aspect of male courtship that influenced copulation success [...] males that copulated displayed more leg raises per second than those that did not copulate.
