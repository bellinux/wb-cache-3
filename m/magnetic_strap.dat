40|$|Objectives To {{test the}} {{effectiveness}} of a typical <b>magnetic</b> wrist <b>strap</b> for reducing pain and stiffness, and for improving physical functioning amongst patients with osteoarthritis. Design A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. Each participant wore four devices over a 16 -week period. Setting Forty five patients with osteoarthritis were recruited from general practices in rural and urban areas of Yorkshire. Interventions Experimental device: a commercially available <b>magnetic</b> wrist <b>strap.</b> Control devices: a weak <b>magnetic</b> wrist <b>strap,</b> a demagnetised wrist strap, and a copper bracelet. Main outcome measures The WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index, the McGill Pain Questionnaire—Pain Rating Index (PRI), a pain visual analogue scale (VAS), and medication use. Results No difference was observed between devices in terms of their effects on pain as measured by the primary outcome measure (WOMAC A), the PRI and the VAS. Similar results were obtained for stiffness (WOMAC B), physical function (WOMAC C), and medication use. Further analyses of the PRI subscales revealed a statistically significant difference between devices (P = 0. 025), which favoured the experimental device. Participants reported lower sensory pain after wearing the standard <b>magnetic</b> wrist <b>strap,</b> than when wearing control devices. However, no adjustment was made for multiple testing. Conclusions Our results indicate that magnetic and copper bracelets are generally ineffective for managing pain, stiffness and physical function in osteoarthritis. Reported therapeutic benefits are most likely attributable to non-specific placebo effects. However such devices have no major adverse effects and may provide hope...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Folklore {{remedies}} for pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis include {{the application of}} magnets and copper to the skin. Despite the popular use of devices containing magnets or copper for this purpose, {{little research has been}} conducted to evaluate the efficacy of such treatments. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the practice of wearing <b>magnetic</b> wrists <b>straps,</b> or copper bracelets, offers any specific therapeutic benefit for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. DESIGN: Randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. METHODS: 70 patients, aged 33 to 79 years and predominantly female (n = 52), with painful rheumatoid arthritis were recruited from general practices within Yorkshire. Participants were randomly allocated to wear four devices in a different order. Devices tested were: a standard (1502 to 2365 gauss) <b>magnetic</b> wrist <b>strap,</b> a demagnetised (0. 05) between the four devices in terms of their effects on pain, inflammation, physical function, disease activity, or medication use. CONCLUSIONS: Wearing a <b>magnetic</b> wrist <b>strap</b> or a copper bracelet did not appear to have any meaningful therapeutic effect, beyond that of a placebo, for alleviating symptoms and combating disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis.

Devices tested were: a standard (1502 to 2365 gauss) <b>magnetic</b> wrist <b>strap,</b> a demagnetised (, 20 gauss) wrist strap, an attenuated (250 to 350 gauss) <b>magnetic</b> wrist <b>strap,</b> and a copper bracelet. Devices were each worn for five weeks, with treatment phases being separated by one week wash-out periods. The primary outcome measured was pain using a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Secondary pain measures were the McGill Pain Questionnaire and tender joint count. Inflammation was assessed using C-reactive protein and plasma viscosity blood tests and by swollen joint count. Physical function was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (Disability Index). Disease activity and medication us...|$|R

High coercivity stripes {{are resistant to}} damage from most magnets likely to be owned by consumers. Low coercivity stripes are easily damaged by even a brief contact with a <b>magnetic</b> purse <b>strap</b> or fastener. Because of this, virtually all bank cards today are encoded on high coercivity stripes despite a slightly higher per-unit cost.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{results of}} three astrophysically {{relevant}} experiments at Caltech are summarized. In the first experiment magnetohydrodynamically driven plasma jets simulate astrophysical jets that undergo a kink instability. Lateral {{acceleration of the}} kinking jet spawns a Rayleigh–Taylor instability, which in turn spawns a magnetic reconnection. Particle heating and a burst of waves are observed {{in association with the}} reconnection. The second experiment uses a slightly different setup to produce an expanding arched plasma loop which is similar to a solar corona loop. It is shown that the plasma in this loop results from jets originating from the electrodes. The possibility of a transition from slow to fast expansion {{as a result of the}} expanding loop breaking free of an externally imposed <b>strapping</b> <b>magnetic</b> field is investigated. The third and completely different experiment creates a weakly ionized plasma with liquid nitrogen cooled electrodes. Water vapour injected into this plasma forms water ice grains that in general are ellipsoidal and not spheroidal. The water ice grains can become quite long (up to several hundred microns) and self-organize so that they are evenly spaced and vertically aligned...|$|R
40|$|Belief in {{the healing}} power of magnets {{can be traced back to}} 200 AD when {{magnetic}} rings were used as cure for arthritis. In the 18 th century such beliefs led to the development of the controlled clinical trial. Yet, despite resulting association with charlatanism, magnet therapy is now a multi billion dollar worldwide industry. Magnetic bracelets in particular are widely reported to alleviate the pain and inflammation of arthritis. The central aims of this thesis were to describe the contextual basis for magnet therapy, to review previous research, and to determine whether magnet therapy has any real benefit for people with arthritis. If true the implications would be far reaching. This thesis provides the first systematic review to focus specifically on evidence concerning magnet therapy for arthritis. Findings from previous trials suggest that the practice of wearing permanent magnets has meaningful analgesic effects. However, several of these trials were hampered by methodological problems. Two further randomised controlled crossover trials led by the present author are therefore described. These employed robust methods of controlling for non-specific treatment effects, involving multiple control devices including the novel use of copper bracelets as placebos. Numerous self-reported outcomes were measured. The latest trial also included objective physiological data on inflammation. Findings from these studies demonstrate that <b>magnetic</b> wrist <b>straps,</b> and also copper bracelets, represent ineffective treatment options for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. This research also confirmed that demagnetised control devices do not represent valid placebos, but that weak magnets and copper bracelets may adequately control for the effects of treatment expectancy. Subsequent synthesis of data from these and previous trials using meta-analysis, and addressing problems of blinding, indicates that magnet therapy lacks any specific (i. e. genuine) therapeutic benefit for people with arthritis. This conclusion and its implications for patient education, clinical practice and research are discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
