40|$|Abstract: A new {{practical}} <b>modal</b> <b>balancing</b> technique, {{which uses}} the modal ratio among mea-surement points (MRMP coeYcient), has been developed. This new method is an improvement upon traditional <b>modal</b> <b>balancing</b> when the rotor {{to be balanced}} operates at the speed between the ®rst and second critical speeds. The concept of the MRMP coeYcient is introduced for the ®rst time in this paper, {{on the basis of}} which the rotor±bearing system can be balanced at any one rotational speed between the ®rst and second critical speeds by decomposing the modal components of unbalance and response simultaneously. Moreover, only one test run is required in three of the four balancing schemes provided in this paper to balance the rotor. In the new method, the test weights need not be orthogonal, so prior modal function knowledge is not necessary for calculation of the test weights, as required in the traditional <b>modal</b> <b>balancing</b> method. To verify the validity of the new technique, a balancing experiment using a rotating cantilever rotor is carried out.

This study explores {{the usefulness of}} a different approach, where the actual overall mobility levels across different ground transportation modes, along with desired changes {{in the use of}} cars and transit, are used as clustering variables. Using a given mode can in fact influence the personal representation of that mode, which in turn has been proven to be a key element in transport behaviours. We form such multimodality-based clusters from two field studies, one involving employees of the French transportation research institute INRETS and the other a representative sample of residents of the US San Francisco Bay Area. We find that strong users of a given mode would like to bring more balance to their ‘‘modal consumptions'' by decreasing the use of this mode more than the average, and increasing the use of the alternative mode. However, concerning ground transport travel budgets, the desire to travel more (or less) overall seems less strongly related to the composition of the <b>modal</b> <b>balance.</b> The US dataset shows also a greater latent demand for travel than the French one.

40|$|Several {{researchers}} have proposed many methods for balancing the rotor {{to reduce the}} machine vibration. Broadly these methods can be categorized into two classes – balancing using measured responses only (known as Influence Coefficient Method) Approach), and balancing using both measured responses and a mathematical (often finite element (FE)) model of rotating machine (<b>Modal</b> <b>Balancing</b> Method). Both of these methods require several trial run-down runs of machine to estimate the unbalance masses and phases at multi balancing plane and usually a substantial experience in field balancing is also required.

Kingery-PageLiterature {{shows that}} {{walkable}} neighborhoods {{have the potential}} to significantly decrease the carbon footprint of cities by lessening the need to drive, as well as providing many health, economic, and social benefits to society. The goal of this research, therefore, was to devise a practical strategy to create walkable places in the car-oriented city of Wichita, Kansas. A necessary component of this strategy is an “urban triage,” described by Jeff Speck in Walkable City as identifying streets with the most existing potential and concentrating limited resources to their improvement (2012, 254). This report employed an urban triage of Wichita at two scales based on three central characteristics of walkability: urban fabric, dense street network and connectivity. Comparing block length and link to node ratio, I built a case for downtown, which is organized on a traditional grid of streets, over a typical shopping district organized around the more modern hierarchical pattern of streets. Within downtown, I further narrowed the study area primarily based on urban fabric, the degree to which streets are enclosed by buildings. I created a method to measure urban fabric, using aerial imagery and street views, taking into account the consistency of the street wall, height of buildings and foreground. The strongest complete corridor, in terms of urban fabric, and three potential links between that corridor and downtown’s largest event space, became the study area for further analysis. A rubric, based on characteristics of walkability extrapolated from literature, served as the instrument to measure the attributes of each block in the study area. Each attribute, as well as the characteristics that they create, yielded a map, contrasting strong and weak blocks. This analysis provided the detailed information necessary to create an informed conceptual strategy to resolve these weaknesses.

Suburban streetscapes have therefore had very little space for other transportation modes to flourish. Automobile-dependency {{is in fact a}} cultural norm, particularly among the middle class. In recent years, Ontario provincial planning and growth policies have addressed the concerns put forth by automobile-dependency and sprawl, mandating intensification of built-forms that facilitate a multi-modal shift aimed towards more sustainable transportation options, such as walking, cycling, and transit. Such a framework could create a more equitable transportation network that caters to people from multiple socio-economic backgrounds, especially those who are limited in their opportunities to afford or use vehicles.

In Sweden the numbers are slightly more in favour of rail transportation, but still a small share {{despite the fact that the}} European Committee promotes sustainable modes of transport. To reduce the environmental impact from the transport sector, and be able to promote the use of sustainable transport modes, it is important to gain an understanding of why the <b>modal</b> <b>balance</b> is disposed this way. By case studies and a survey, four factors, viz costs, environmental impact, attitudes and risks, and their impact on the choice of mode of transportation for companies located in the vicinity of a rail terminal are studied. The results clearly show that the environmental impact of rail {{transportation is}} only a fraction of that of the road transportation and could possibly influence the choice of rail transportation in a positive way. However, rail transportation is less cost efficient, flexible and reliable and these aspects – despite the advantageous conditions in terms of infrastructure and geographical vicinity to a rail terminal – contribute to a negative bias towards rail transportation among companies in the study. Thus, the cost and attitudes factors counteract the choice of rail transportation. In addition, risks, as the final factor, also counteracts the choice, since it is found that respondents consider the risks of disturbances such as delays, theft and accidents to be important when considering mode of transportation and that rail transportation is viewed as lacking compared to road transportation. This thesis contributes to the existing theory about the costs-related issues and the environmental impact of rail transportation, as well as how companies with beneficial conditions to employ rail transportation consider the mode with regards to e. g. reliability and safety, and how these factors influence the modal choice among buyers of transportation services that are located close to a rail terminal. With this knowledge, policymakers are informed of which areas to concentrate taxes, subsidizations and information to. These things are in all probability necessary if a large scale modal shift is desired. The contribution of the effect a modal shift could have on the environmental impact of the transportation might make certain practitioners that compete on a market where a low environmental footprint is a strong competitive weapon to rethink their modal choice.

Indeed, also the most recent reports on environment in Italian cities show that the pollution levels are increasing in the big cities, although the news are full of very expensive projects, innovative solutions and unexpected goals continuously shown by public administrations. One of the main environmental detractors is car traffic, which has recently gained on public transport. unlike the previous period. Most of mobility policies implemented in our cities aims at reaching the <b>modal</b> <b>balance</b> by means of measures for controlling and managing the demand for mobility, for mitigating traffic and limiting circulation., such as the road pricing and the parking strategies; for developing and increasing public transport and not polluting means of transport, car sharing and car pooling. All of them have showed modest results both in terms of pollution reduction and vehicular traffic reduction. For over fifty years, mostly in the United States, the Personal Rapid Transit has been tested, a system of public transport trying to join two apparently incompatible factors: the possibility of assuring individual travels and the need for decreasing the levels of acoustic and air pol¬lution as well as the congestion caused by private vehicular traffic. In Italy this system is still not well known despite the versatility of its fields of application. In the United States and all over the world the most successful applications concern circumscribed mono-functional urban ambits, such as large areas for offices, airports and so on, but the characteristics of this system - such as flexibility, capability of integration with other wide-range systems of public transport, little dimensions of the exchange junctions, quite low cost - can allow to realize it also in different typologies of area. If many people are doubtful about the effectiveness of this system, on the contrary, other people think that its steady implementation and experimentation is necessary to improve urban liveability.

Using a pioneer measure {{for sustainable development}} (SD), {{and based on the}} conformity of the growths of all sectors with transportation modes, the countries are comparatively studied. The proposed measure, elasticity, for each pair of variables indicates {{the extent to which the}} two variables have been changing consistently. Indeed the elasticity values are measures of “harmonic development ” reflecting sustainability. The study database consisted of key aspects of transportation sustainability in the form of national variables including transportation, economic, social and environmental categories in the period 1980 - 1995. Having developed the elasticity of the social, environmental and economic variables with respect to those of modal transportation, composite modal sustainability indices were suggested. The composite indices were then integrated into a unique SD index utilizing the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), and Concordance Analysis (CA) techniques. For comparative appraisal, country ranking and grouping based on DEA scores, as well as CA results were developed. The sustainability appraisal showed interesting patterns within and between group similarities and differences. The study confirmed the significance of <b>modal</b> transportation <b>balancing</b> and sustainability challenges of the 21 st century. The research focus is on its methodology. Thus, the data gathered from any other time period and geographical scope may be used for further analysis...|$|R
