She also issued the following statement: [...] "I am devastated to have just received this tragic news. <b>My</b> <b>prayers</b> go out to those who were injured and their families along with my deepest sympathy to all those affected by this heartbreaking news." [...] At her concert in Italy Madonna made an emotional tribute for the deceased technicians by saying: [...] "I just wanted to take a moment to acknowledge and pay tribute to two people who lost their lives today, [...] It's a great tragedy to me, I feel so devastated to be in any way associated with anyone's suffering. [...] Let's all just take a moment to say a prayer for Charles Criscenzo and Charlie Prow. Our hearts go out to their family and loved ones." ...|$|E

500|$|During one scene, Rosa Lee tells Mac, [...] "I say <b>my</b> <b>prayers</b> for you {{and when}} I thank the Lord for his tender mercies, you're {{at the head of}} the list." [...] Scholar Robert Jewett compares this line to the first verse of Romans 12, in which Paul the Apostle appeals to Christians to live out their lives in service to others [...] "through the mercies of God". Many of the {{elements}} of Mac's redemption, conversion to Christianity and budding relationship with Rosa Lee occur off-camera, including their wedding. Jewett writes, [...] "This is perfectly congruent with the theme of faith in the hidden mercies of God, the secret plot of the life of faith in Romans.... It is a matter of faith, elusive and intangible." [...] Jewett compares Mac's story to that of Abraham, because [...] "just like Sledge's story, [...] centers on the provision of a future through the tender mercies of God". As told in Romans 4, Abraham and his wife Sarah are too old to produce a son, but Abraham develops the faith that God will provide them an heir, which is exactly what occurs, though—as Paul describes—Abraham did nothing practical to guarantee or deserve such a miracle. Jewett describes Mac as similarly undeserving of redemption, based on his selfish and abusive past, typified by his condition in his first encounter with Rosa Lee: in a drunken stupor following a motel room fight. She takes him in and eventually falls in love with him, despite his having done nothing to deserve her care or his redemption: [...] "It is an undeserved grace, a gift of providence from a simple woman who continues to pray for him and to be grateful for him." ...|$|E

Realizing his illness was terminal, he secured Zumwalt's permission to return to his command and serve as long as he could. [...] "I am a realist and know that I am on borrowed time," [...] Colbert wrote his chaplain. [...] "I am convinced that the Lord has decided to give me some extra time to do some things in this, my last command, which might better insure a safer world.

2500|$|A {{tradition}} {{recorded in}} 1693 is that Hathaway [...] "greatly desired" [...] {{to be buried}} with her husband. In fact she was interred in a separate grave {{next to him in}} the Church of the Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon. The inscription states, [...] "Here lyeth the body of Anne wife of William Shakespeare who departed this life the 6th day of August 1623 being of the age of 67 years." [...] A Latin inscription followed which translates as [...] "Breasts, O mother, milk and life thou didst give. Woe is me– for how great a boon shall I give stones? How much rather would I pray that the good angel should move the stone so that, like Christ's body, thine image might come forth! But <b>my</b> <b>prayers</b> are unavailing. Come quickly, Christ, that my mother, though shut within this tomb may rise again and reach the stars." [...] The inscription may have been written by John Hall on behalf of his wife, Anne's daughter, Susanna.|$|E
