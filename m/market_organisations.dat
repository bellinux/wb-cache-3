40|$|This article {{contributes}} {{to the understanding of}} the changes that projectification — strongly reinforced by the European Union (EU) — causes in public labour <b>market</b> <b>organisations</b> in Poland. The introduction of project work to the hitherto hierarchical organisational structures found in public organisations influences them. There is, however, a research gap on how changes at the macro level affect individual public organisations and how these organisations change due to the introduction of project work into their structures. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate changes in Polish public labour <b>market</b> <b>organisations</b> caused by projectification. The author draws on a set of quantitative and qualitative data that include a survey conducted in 57 public local organisations as well as interviews conducted at 10 public offices at local and regional levels. A sequential mixed methods approach was used. The results indicate that projectification due to the EU caused changes in organisational structures of public organisations and influenced the selection of the projects. In particular, the findings relating to projectification of the EU and its impact on public labour market institutions in Poland deepen previous research by identifying the specific changes occurring at the level of individual public organisations. These changes are diverse in nature, yet the most important of these relate to the adaptation of organisational goals to the objectives of the grant applications as well as to the changes in organisational structures. The study also illustrates that while EU-funded projects are almost always completed on time, do not exceed their budgets, and achieve the indicators of the EU programs, such projects do not always provide the value that a local community would expect. Therefore, there is a need for the EU to not only assess project success on time, cost and quality measures, but also to assess project success on local impact and value created for stakeholders. ...|$|E
40|$|The gender pay gap is a {{persistent}} challenge across different national contexts. Within these contexts, however, {{the underlying mechanisms}} that {{have resulted in the}} gender pay gap can take different shape. In Finland, the gender pay gap has been resistant to policy measures implemented in order to reduce it. This thesis aims to shed light on some of the central features of Finnish society, its institutional context, central actors, and stakeholders, and how these are linked to the apparent failures of Finnish equal pay policy. This study offers a broad-ranging sociological understanding of Finnish society, its historical development, and the kind of citizenship it has offered to its female citizens. The thesis also discusses the role of central labour <b>market</b> <b>organisations</b> in institutionalising wage relativities between the different industries in the Finnish labour market and protecting their vested interests in policy-making. The empirical part of the thesis consists of three articles, each of which addresses an issue that is critical to Finnish and international equal pay policy: the role of collective agreements in institutionalising gendered valuations in wage setting in the Finnish local government sector, evaluation-based pay systems and the assumption that they inherently promote gender pay equity, and non-decision making in tripartite policy process and the way it affected the drafting of the new Finnish gender equality legislation. The first data set was gathered in a participatory action research project in which 18 Finnish organisations took part. The aim of the project was to promote equal pay through developing pay systems The second data set consists of the official minutes of the meetings of the tripartite working group that drafted the law about equal pay comparisons that are mandatory for organisations to conduct. The thesis mainly uses qualitative research methods, along with quantitative and documentary analysis. Based on the research findings, the following arguments are made. The Finnish welfare state has played an active role in creating a secondary labour market for Finnish women in the reproductive work of the public sector. The central labour <b>market</b> <b>organisations</b> have further strengthened the gendered division of labour and hierarchy between male-dominated and female-dominated sectors and industries by institutionalising the wage relativities between these industries in collective agreements. As central actors and powerful players in Finnish policy-making, the central labour <b>market</b> <b>organisations</b> protect their vested interests and resist changes to equal pay policy and legislation. Instead of directly addressing the most important structural and institutional features of the Finnish labour market, current Finnish equal pay policy focuses on less controversial issues, such as organisational practices. Failure to address the most relevant issues on gender pay equity results in modest advances in policy outcomes...|$|E

40|$|Rapid and {{thorough}} changes have recently {{taken place in}} dairy supply chain in the whole Central and Eastern Europe.

Using cointegrated vector autoregression and controlling for potential structural breaks, it is shown that Polish milk prices, as opposed to Hungarian ones, are characterised by short- and long-term asymmetries.

The decoupling of support from production is affecting the relative profitability of the crops and farmers’ production decisions. The impact of these reforms is assessed on the basis of available data on cropped area and of an estimation of the irrigated land by crop. A not-negligible decline in irrigated area has already happened and this trend is stronger in Central and Southern Italy rather than in Northern Italy. Because of the Cap reform, part of the Italian irrigated agriculture is facing a reduced number of production opportunities and becomes more sensitive to likely increases of water cost.

40|$|A new Common <b>Market</b> <b>Organisation</b> (CMO) for {{fruit and}} {{vegetables}} is in place from 1 January 2008. First debate about reform was lunched in 2004 by European Commission and its publication about simplification of the Fruit and Vegetable Common <b>Market</b> <b>Organisation.</b> The last extensive reform in 1996 introduced modifications like {{a plan for the}} progressive reduction of support for short-term market intervention and the strengthening of structural aid to improve competitiveness in order to help producers to develop their capacity and to adapt to market demand. The most important reasons for the new reform of CMO for {{fruit and vegetables}} are imbalance in the supply and distributions chain, limited influence of the producers’ organisations, coherence with rural development aid and the questions of standards.

40|$|Organisations {{in the new}} {{millennium}} are faced with significant challenges to compete in a globalised system that involves the integration of free markets. In order to successfully compete in the global <b>market,</b> <b>organisations</b> in transitional economies have to develop the organisational culture that espouses employee's contribution to the organisational effectiveness.

This in turn has an affect on the employee's commitment to the company through the process of recruitment and selection, performance appraisal, reward systems, training and development. In companies where human resources management is in its infancy, the organisational culture affects the employee's commitment to the company primarily through the reward systems. In this paper we focus on identifying theoretical concepts, principles, and methods in human resources management (HRM) for transitional companies. We conclude that transitional companies need to focus on the development of an organisational culture based on core values of rewarding excellent performance and increasing the opportunities and challenges for their employees...|$|E
