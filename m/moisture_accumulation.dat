40|$|One of the {{criteria}} for a moisture-tolerant roof is that <b>moisture</b> <b>accumulation</b> in a roofing system must not {{be large enough to}} cause condensation within the roof, since this can damage the insulation and reduce its effectiveness. Failing this criterion would require the inclusion of a vapor retarder into the roofing system. We have tested this requirement using computer simulations for a series of new roofing systems and environmental conditions. This paper uses the database from those simulations to develop a simplified method to predict condensation control using only variables associated with the roof and environmental conditions. This method assesses the potential for condensation within the roof assembly without having to perform a computer simulation. Using the computer simulation output data, the <b>moisture</b> <b>accumulation</b> inside each of the roofing systems was calculated. A critical threshold of <b>moisture</b> <b>accumulation</b> was assigned by analyzing the roofing systems which fail to prevent condensation from occurring within the roofing system. An empirical equation for <b>moisture</b> <b>accumulation</b> as a function of roof system and environmental condition variables is developed.

The results of two field experiments in 2003 and 2004, where soil strength was manipulated by compaction and irrigation, demonstrated that the yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was sensitive to physical stress in the root zone. We obtained linear relationships between yield and soil strength and between yield and accumulated soil <b>moisture</b> data (<b>accumulation</b> analogous to thermal time), with similar slopes for both seasons. We were unable to detect root-sourced signals of xylem-sap ABA concentration, despite changes in stomatal conductance. When mechanical impedance and matric potential were varied independently in controlled environments, the growth of wheat was sensitive to mechanical impedance, but not to small changes in matric potential.

Cool roofs may affect the hygrothermal performance of roofing systems and hence their performance should be characterized in different climates. We simulated the performance of several roofing systems including: Typical, smart, and self-drying roofs for residential and commercial buildings. In addition, we proposed vented roofs with smart vapor retarders in different climate regions across North America. We also developed an algorithm to investigate the effect of snow on hygrothermal behaviour {{of black and white}} roofs.

40|$|An trench profile {{method was}} used to study {{seasonal}} variation of root ecological characteristics of Alhagi sparsifolia Shap. seedlings under different irrigation treatments. The results indicated the following: (1) Root morphology: under excellent soil moisture conditions, A. sparsifolia seedlings developed many horizontal roots and root sprouts to compete for light; but under poor soil moisture, the vertical root system expanded its resource space into deeper soil. Plasticity of root morphology is an important strategy to capture water and adapt to the hyperarid environment. (2) Root/shoot ratio: root/shoot ratio increased with declining soil moisture, and this trend was more obvious later in the growing season. Increase of root/shoot ratio is a strategy for adapting to drought. (3) Growth of root system: The seedlings prefer to develop roots in shallower sur face layers with less water availability. The growth depth and vertical growth rate of roots increased with decreased soil <b>moisture.</b> (4) <b>Accumulation</b> of root biomass: biomass and surface {{area of the root}} system decreased with increased soil depth, with the roots distributed in an ‘inverted pyramid’ in vertical section view.

40|$|Our Lord in the Attic is a {{historic}} house museum located in the historic center of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. It is a typical 17 th century Dutch canal house, with a hidden Church in the attic. The Church was used regularly until 1887 when the house became a museum. The annual total number of visitors has grown from 36, 000 in 1990 to 75, 000 in 2005; this trend is exponentially increasing. The museum had between 100 – 650 visitors each day in 2005; they typically stayed in the building for about an hour. There were two visitation peaks: one in the mid-morning and another in mid-afternoon. On two separate days each year the museum records large numbers (well over 1, 000) of visitors. Masses, weddings, and music concerts, attended by 50 – 150 persons, are regularly held in the Church. The museum has consequently expressed major concern over {{the impact of the}} growing number of visitors on the various collection environments. A historic indoor climate of 10 % - 95 % relative humidity was estimated, from when the central heating system, which may have caused the majority of damages to the collection, was installed in the 1950 ’s to the installation of humidifiers in the 1990 ’s. However, between January 2005 and January 2006, in spite of a few central heating system malfunctions and large visitor numbers that particular year, the recent climate in the museum building did not reach harmful levels for the collections. Direct impacts of visitors were documented as increases in temperature, relative humidity, and CO 2 concentration when the museum opened each morning as well as during special events in the church. However, relative humidity peaks remained less than 75 %, and the value decayed quickly after the visitors had left the rooms or {{near the end of the}} museum’s visiting hours. As confirmed through air exchange rate measurements in the church, a high infiltration rate of outside air was the reason for reduced peaks and fast decay of the relative humidity and CO 2 concentration. Daily maxima of CO 2 concentration exceeding 1500 ppm were recorded whenever the daily total of visitors exceeded 500. Daily averages over the 08 : 00 – 17 : 00 period exceeded 1000 ppm whenever more than 600 visitors were recorded. However, the high infiltration rate completely diluted the CO 2 concentration to an ambient level by the following morning. From the consideration of the CO 2 and <b>moisture</b> <b>accumulations,</b> 600 visitors per day, well-distributed over the museum’s operational hours, can be safely accommodated in winter. The number can be increased to twice this during the summer by opening the entrance door and a window in the attic for increased natural ventilation. However, other important issues, such as safe levels of floor loading and vibration, as well as overall visitor comfort and experience, will have to be taken into consideration and may well result in allowing fewer visitors than what is recommended based on these calculations...|$|R
40|$|Potash {{fertilizer}} is granular {{bulk product}} and is comprised {{almost entirely of}} potassium chloride. It is used widely, often with other fertilizers, for agricultural soils low in potassium, an essential nutrient for plant growth. It readily accumulates moisture when subjected to humid air for extended time periods during handling and storage. In this thesis, the <b>moisture</b> <b>accumulation</b> near the surface of granular potash fertilizer products is studied. The coupled heat and moisture transfer during handling processes and warehouse storage is modeled as a coupled one-dimensional transient heat and moisture diffusion problem at the air-potash interface. A one-dimensional transient numerical model of heat and moisture transfer, including adsorption/dissolution and condensation, is developed. Temperature and <b>moisture</b> <b>accumulation</b> profiles within potash bed are simulated and compared to measured data under {{a wide range of}} operating conditions for two types of potash. The numerical model is validated using experimental data from potash layer in a test facility subject to a wide range oftest conditions. For humid airflow over the top of a potash layer with three different supply air humidities (i. e. 45 %, 65 % and 80 % RH), <b>moisture</b> <b>accumulation</b> and temperature distribution have been investigated under the constant room temperature (i. e. 22 °C) with and without a cold temperature at the bottom boundary. When the local relative humidities are less than 52 % RH, water vapor accumulates on the particle surface by adsorption which causes a very small <b>moisture</b> <b>accumulation.</b> When local relative humidities exceed 53 % RH, water vapor accumulates on potash by dissolution which creates a thin layer of electrolytic solution on particle surfaces and causes significant <b>moisture</b> <b>accumulation.</b> A 20 °C temperature difference across the potash layer results in moisture contents 10 time larger than the case with no temperature difference, implying that the moisture transfer in potash is strongly coupled with temperature distribution in the heat and moisture diffusion processes. To illustrate the application of the simulation model, simulations were done for the problems of moisture redistribution within potash after mixing and the rapid moisture gains for cold potash placed on a conveyor belts exposed to humid air. It is found that the process of moisture redistribution in potash will continue as long as temperature and moisture content differences persist anywhere within potash bed. The rapid <b>moisture</b> <b>accumulation</b> is only significant for a narrow surface layer which is about 10 % of potash mass placed on a conveyor belts. Heating the potash on a conveyor belt near the surface layer to that of ambient air temperature could reduce the <b>moisture</b> <b>accumulation</b> by 4 to 8 times. It is concluded from this research that the complex physical and chemical processes for water vapor accumulation in exposed granular potash can be modeled and simulated...|$|E
40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{concerns a}} case study involving moisture performance of a contemporary wood frame house over a series of heating seasons in Madison, Wisconsin. Over most of the heating seasons, the building was humidified to levels as calculated by methodology outlined in section 4. 3. 2 of Proposed ASHRAE Standard 160, Design Criteria for Moisture Control in Buildings. Over the first two heating seasons following construction, indoor humidity levels moderately lower than design conditions were attained, even though the house was neither occupied nor humidified. The moisture source was evidently wet soil around the building foundation, a condition probably associated with roof runoff deposited near the foundation during construction. Over the third, fourth and fifth heating seasons the house was brought to design indoor humidity values with less than anticipated mois ture release by humidifiers. Throughout the study, the indoor humidity levels resulted in some window condensation in cold weather, but the condensation was restricted to glass panes. Attic spaces remained dry. Painted wood-based sidings showed no staining, buckling, warping or finish failure. Stucco cladding showed cracking that, although minor, {{would be consistent with}} seasonal <b>moisture</b> <b>accumulation</b> in the sheathing. Substantial seasonal <b>moisture</b> <b>accumulation</b> was measured in the sheathing of exterior walls that did not incorporate an interior vapor retarder.

Accurate monitoring of atmospheric water vapor distribution is thus essential in predicting the severity and life cycle of heavy rain. This paper presents a systematic study on the application of tomographic solutions to investigate water vapor variations during heavy precipitation events. Using global positioning system (GPS) observations, the wet refractivity field was constructed at a temporal resolution of 30 min for three heavy precipitation events occurring in Hong Kong, China, in 2010 - 14. The zenith wet delay (ZWD) is shown to be a good indicator in observing the water vapor evolution in heavy rain events. The variabilities of water vapor at five altitude layers (> 1000, 1000 - 2000, 2000 - 3000, 3000 - 5000, and > 5000 m) were examined. It revealed that water vapor above 3000 m has larger fluctuation than that under 3000 m, though it accounts for only 10 %- 25 % of the total amount of water vapor. The relative humidity fields derived from tomographic results revealed <b>moisture</b> variation, <b>accumulation,</b> saturation, and condensation during the heavy rain events.

40|$|Income {{and risk}} aspects of wheat-fallow {{cropping}} systems are analyzed in western North Dakota. A wheat yield trend estimation model based on county yields (1950 - 77) is developed using independent variables of year, annual precipitation, acres of nonfal-lowed wheat, and a dummy variable for fallow and nonfallow practices. The year-to-year change in wheat yields on fallowed and nonfallowed land indicates that summer fallow is becoming less desirable economically. Based on 1980 costs and yields, summer fallow maximizes returns {{to land at}} low yields, low wheat prices, and high nitrogen prices. Income variability is reduced under summer fallow. Agriculture in the western states is heavily reliant upon summer fallow [Haas, et al,]. In 1980 North Dakota had 6. 4 million acres or about 22 percent of total cropland devoted to summer fallow [Carver and Hamlin]. Durum and other spring wheat are the major crops produced on summer-fallowed land. Eighty percent of the North Dakota land summer-fallowed in 1979 was planted to all wheat in 1980 [Carver and Hamlin]. The primary benefit of summer fallow is higher crop yield resulting from increased soil <b>moisture,</b> nitrogen <b>accumulation,</b> and weed control. Additional benefits are in-creased stability of production and improved seasonal distribution of work. The cost for the farmer is the income foregone by not crop-ping the land for a season plus tillage costs during the fallow year. The practice of summer fallow leaves the soil without a crop cover which greatly in-creases soil losses through wind and water erosion and contributes to air and water pol-lution [Ehni, et al.; Haas, et al.; Fanning and Reff]. Also summer fallow is a contributing factor {{to the development of}} saline seeps which are making significant amounts of land less productive [Worcester, et al. ]. Erosio...|$|R

40|$|Canopy {{effect in}} this paper refers to the {{phenomenon}} whereby moisture accumulates underneath an impervious cover. Field observations reveal that the canopy effect can occur in relatively dry soils where the groundwater table is deep {{and can lead to}} full saturation of the soil immediately underneath the impervious cover. However, numerical analysis based on existing theories of heat and mass transfer in unsaturated soils can only reproduce a minor amount of <b>moisture</b> <b>accumulation</b> caused by an impervious cover, particularly when the groundwater table is relatively deep. In an attempt to explain the observed canopy effect in the field, this paper proposes a new mechanism of <b>moisture</b> <b>accumulation</b> in unsaturated freezing soils: vapour transfer in such a soil is accelerated by the process of vapour–ice desublimation. A new approach for modelling moisture and heat movements is proposed in which phase changes during the evaporation, condensation and desublimation of vapour flow are considered. A laboratory device is designed specifically to study vapour transfer in unsaturated freezing soils. The test results reveal that vapour transfer can lead to significant moisture and ice accumulation near the freezing end of a soil specimen. The computed results show that the proposed model can indeed reproduce the unusual <b>moisture</b> <b>accumulation</b> observed in relatively dry soils. The results also demonstrate that soil freezing fed by vapour transfer can result in a water content that is close to full saturation.

Such algorithms require accurate knowledge of the spatial response function of the individual measurements, “slices ” and “eggs”. Standard SeaWinds data products from JPL include the locations of the measurements, but not the response functions. In this paper we derive the spatial response function for both egg and slices. The response functions vary with antenna azimuth and orbit location. Because computation of the response function is laborious, methods of tabularizing and interpolating the response function have been developed. These are described in this paper. We provide code and the tables to enable computation the response function using information from standard JPL data products. We hope these will further the development of resolution-enhanced SeaWinds data. Examples of resulting enhanced resolution images are included...|$|R
40|$|Core {{samples were}} {{collected}} from two boreholes drilled in the subsidence crater of the Hyrax event (U 3 bh). The moisture in the core samples was extracted via freeze drying and tritiw-n was measured in the extracted <b>moisture</b> via `He <b>accumulation</b> mass spectrometry or liquid scintillation counting. Elevated tritium concentrations (IE 4 - IE 6 pCi/L extracted moisture as {{of the time of}} measurement) were observed in the extracted moisture from virtually all of the core samples with significant increases beginning at about 30 ft depth. No longer-lived fission products (144 Ce) or activation products (`OCo, `Eu, 114 En) were observed by gamma-ray spectroscopy in a subset of the core samples. This likely indicates that a catastrophic failure of containment (if it occurred) did not release significant radioactivities to this shallow depth (30 ft). The presence of `Cs at much greater depths (@ 210 ft, 64 m) may indicate that gaseous and/or vapor products were released shortly after the Hyrax event to a depth of about 210 ft. The relatively shallow depth where the elevated tritium is observed makes highly improbable any significant linkage between the elevated tritium concentrations and a Hyrax event containment failure. This may indicate that an additional source of enriched `H was introduced at this site...|$|R
40|$|Arctic {{terrestrial}} {{ecosystems are}} heterogeneous {{because of the}} strong influences of microtopography, soil <b>moisture</b> and snow <b>accumulation</b> on vegetation distribution. The interaction between local biotic and abiotic factors and global climate patterns will influence species responses to climate change. Salix arctica (Arctic willow) is a structuring species, ubiquitous and widespread, and as such {{is one of the}} most important shrub species in the High Arctic. In this study, we measured S. arctica reproductive effort, early establishment, survival and growth in the Zackenberg valley, north-east Greenland. We sampled four plant communities that varied with respect to snow conditions, soil moisture, nutrient content and plant composition. We found large variability in reproductive effort and success with total catkin density ranging from 0. 6 to 66 catkins/m 2 and seedling density from < 1 to 101 seedlings/m 2. There were also major differences in crown area increment (4 – 23 cm 2 /year) and stem radial growth (40 – 74 µm/year). The snowbed community, which experienced a recent reduction in snow cover, supported young populations with high reproductive effort, establishment and growth. Soil nutrient content and herbivore activity apparently did not strongly constrain plant reproduction and growth, but competition by Cassiope tetragona and low soil moisture may inhibit performance. Our results show that local environmental factors, such as snow accumulation, have a significant impact on tundra plant response to climate change and will affect the understanding of regional vegetation response to climate change...|$|R
