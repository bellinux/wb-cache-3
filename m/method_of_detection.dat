25|$|Genes are {{commonly}} {{regarded as the}} basic units transferred through an HGT event. However {{it is also possible}} for HGT to occur within genes. For example, {{it has been shown that}} horizontal transfer between closely related species results in more exchange of ORF fragments, a type a transfer called gene conversion, mediated by homologous recombination. The analysis of a group of four Escherichia coli and two Shigella flexneri strains revealed that the sequence stretches common to all six strains contain polymorphic sites, consequences of homologous recombination. Clusters of excess of polymorphic sites can thus be used to detect tracks of DNA recombined with a distant relative. This <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>detection</b> is, however, restricted to the sites in common to all analysed sequences, limiting the analysis to a group of closely related organisms.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>detection</b> i. e. {{the mode of}} {{investigation}} employed to catch a criminal in American detective dramas on television. It divides <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>detection</b> into the categories of ?rational-scientific? and ?irrational-subjective?. ?Rational-scientific? <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>detection</b> {{are linked to the}} literary tradition of Golden Age fiction and suggest an analytical distance to the crime. ?Irrational-subjective? methods are linked to a hard-boiled tradition and suggest (often emotional) ?closeness? to the victim, suspects or witnesses. Drawing on the work of Michel Foucault, John Fiske and Jason Mittell, this thesis views genre as discourse. As such, television genre is viewed as always changing and intersecting with a variety of other discourses, for example, representing social and political debates, shifts within the television industry and mirroring ideologies of ?truth-finding?. It analyses <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>detection</b> as a discourse internal to the genre, as a genre convention, as well as external to the genre i. e. as relating to discourses regarding social, political and industrial developments. It also explores how <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>detection,</b> as an expression of ideologies of ?truth-finding?, reveal how a specific series may be positioned in relationship to modern post-Enlightenment and postmodern discourses. A number of texts from different historical moments (Dragnet [NBC, 1951 - 1959], Quincy, M. E. [NBC, 1976 - 1983], CSI: Crime Scene Investigation [CBS, 2000 -], Hill Street Blues [NBC, 1981 - 1987], Twin Peaks [ABC, 1990 - 1991] and The Shield [fX, 2002 - 2008]) are analysed as examples of how individual genre texts represent these shifts in attitudes towards ?truth-finding?. In a final step, this thesis analyses The Wire (HBO, 2002 - 2008) and Dexter (Showtime, 2006 -) as dramas that represent a more recent shift in the representation of ideologies of ?truth-finding? that may formulate ?alternative? <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>detection</b> and a possible epistemological shift in postmodern culture.

The virus is not detectable with conventional testing but can be found with ultra-sensitive tests. The original <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>detection</b> was by demonstrating the viral genome within liver biopsies, but newer methods include an antibody test for the virus' core protein and the detection of the viral genome after first concentrating the viral particles by ultracentrifugation. A form of infection with persistently moderately elevated serum liver enzymes but without antibodies to hepatitis C has also been reported. This form is known as cryptogenic occult infection.|$|E
50|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{facilitated by}} higher incoming neutron energies, neutron detection is generally a difficult task, {{for all the}} reasons stated earlier. Thus, better scintillator design {{is also in the}} foreground and has been the topic of pursuit ever since the invention of scintillation detectors. Scintillation detectors were invented in 1903 by Crookes but were not very efficient until the PMT (photomultiplier tube) was developed by Curran and Baker in 1944. The PMT gives a reliable and efficient <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>detection</b> since it multiplies the detection signal tenfold. Even so, scintillation design has room for improvement as do other options for neutron detection besides scintillation.|$|E
50|$|Measurements {{of cosmic}} {{microwave}} background radiation (CMB) by experiments such as COBE, BOOMERanG, WMAP, CBI and many others have greatly advanced our knowledge of cosmology, particularly the early evolution of the universe. It is expected that higher resolution CMB observations will not only improve the precision of current knowledge, but will also allow new types of measurements. At ACT resolutions, the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZ), by which galaxy clusters leave an imprint on the CMB, should be prominent. The power of this <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>detection</b> {{is that it is}} a redshift-independent measurement of the mass of the clusters, meaning that very distant, ancient clusters are as easy to detect as nearby clusters.|$|E

50|$|An {{increase}} in potato plant infection with viruses {{over the past}} few years has led to considerable losses to the South African potato industry. The increased rate of infection may be attributed to several factors. These include a marked decrease in the effectiveness and administration of chemicals used in vector control, the use of infected seed potatoes in cultivation, incorrect irrigation and farming methods as well as a lack of a sensitive, rapid and reliable <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>detection.</b> An {{increase in}} the average temperature of winters as a consequence of global warming has also led to an increase in aphid numbers, which in turn has led to an increase in viral distribution.|$|E
50|$|Another {{application}} in agriculture is {{the detection of}} animal proteins in compound feeds to avoid bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known as mad-cow disease. Different {{studies have been done}} to propose alternative tools to the reference <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>detection,</b> (classical microscopy). One of the first alternatives is near infrared microscopy (NIR), which combines the advantages of microscopy and NIR. In 2004, the first study relating this problem with hyperspectral imaging was published. Hyperspectral libraries that are representative of the diversity of ingredients usually present in the preparation of compound feeds were constructed. These libraries can be used together with chemometric tools to investigate the limit of detection, specificity and reproducibility of the NIR hyperspectral imaging method for the detection and quantification of animal ingredients in feed.|$|E

50|$|Planet b is a superjovian gas giant with 6 {{times the}} mass of Jupiter.

This second planet exerted a gravitational force on the first planet, orbiting its host star in just 34 days.

5000|$|There are two complex {{steps in}} the {{manufacture}} of antibody for immunolabeling. The first is producing the antibody that binds specifically to the antigen of interest and the second is fusing the tag to the antibody. Since it is impractical to fuse a tag to every conceivable antigen-specific antibody, most immunolabeling processes use an indirect <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>detection.</b> This indirect method employs a primary antibody that is antigen-specific and a secondary antibody fused to a tag that specifically binds the primary antibody. This indirect approach permits mass production of secondary antibody that can be bought off the shelf. [...] Pursuant to this indirect method, the primary antibody is added to the test system. The primary antibody seeks out and binds to the target antigen. The tagged secondary antibody, designed to attach exclusively to the primary antibody, is subsequently added.|$|E

To identify the causative organism(s), at least two sets of blood cultures using bottles with media for aerobic and anaerobic organisms should be obtained, {{with at least one}} drawn through the skin and one drawn through each vascular access device (such as an IV catheter) in place more than 48 hours. Bacteria are present in the blood (bacteremia) in only about 30% of cases. Another possible <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>detection</b> is by polymerase chain reaction. If other sources of infection are suspected, cultures of these sources, such as urine, cerebrospinal fluid, wounds, or respiratory secretions, also should be obtained, as long as this does not delay the use of antibiotics.|$|E
