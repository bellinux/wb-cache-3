We first derive a closed-form ex- pression of spectrum <b>access</b> <b>opportunity</b> by taking into ac- count the random variations in number, locations and trans- mitted powers of primary users (PUs). Then, we show how SU sensing range affects spectrum <b>access</b> <b>opportunity,</b> and the tradeoff between SU sensing range and spectrum ac- cess opportunity is formulated as an optimization problem to maximize spectrum <b>access</b> <b>opportunity.</b> Furthermore, we prove that there exists an optimal SU sensing range which yields the maximum spectrum <b>access</b> <b>opportunity,</b> and nu- merical results validate our theoretical analysis...|$|R

40|$|In {{cognitive}} radio networks (CRNs), secondary users (SUs) can proactively obtain spectrum <b>access</b> <b>opportunities</b> by helping with primary users' (PUs') data transmissions. Currently, {{such kind of}} spectrum access is implemented via a cooperative communications based link-level frame-based cooperative (LLC) approach where individual SUs independently serve as relays for PUs {{in order to gain}} spectrum <b>access</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Unfortunately, this LLC approach cannot fully exploit spectrum <b>access</b> <b>opportunities</b> to enhance the throughput of CRNs and fails to motivate PUs to join the spectrum sharing processes. To address these challenges, we propose a network-level session-based cooperative (NLC) approach where SUs are grouped together to cooperate with PUs session by session, instead of frame by frame as what has been done in existing works, for spectrum <b>access</b> <b>opportunities</b> of the corresponding group. Thanks to our group-based session-by-session cooperating strategy, our NLC approach is able to address all those challenges in the LLC approach. To articulate our NLC approach, we further develop an NLC scheme under a cognitive capacity harvesting network (CCHN) architecture. We formulate the cooperative mechanism design as a cross-layer optimization problem with constraints on primary session selection, flow routing and link scheduling. To search for solutions to the optimization problem, we propose an augmented scheduling index ordering based (SIO-based) algorithm to identify maximal independent sets. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NLC approach and the superiority of the augmented SIO-based algorithm over the traditional method...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impacts of}} trade liberalization in a non-integrated industry where a marketing agency controls the supply of a necessary input {{in the production of}} a processed commodity. Trade of the processed good is restricted through a Tariff-Rate Quota (TRQ) and domestic processors operate in an imperfectly competitive industry. Under a fixed proportions technology, an increase in the <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> commitment of the TRQ will generally lower the domestic retail price to consumers if the marketing agency is a profit-maximizing monopolist. Conversely, if the marketing agency pursues some specific non-economic objectives, it is shown that increases in the <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> commitment holding the tariff rates constant can lead to higher retail prices and thus negate the benefits of trade liberalization for consumers. ...|$|R
40|$|A major {{objective}} of the Uruguay Round negotiation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is to bring agricultural commodities under general GATT rules and disciplines. The United States and the Cairns Group countries (with the exception of Canada) are insisting on tariffication of all nontariff barriers (NTBs) to trade without exception. On the other hand, the European Community (EC) and Japan are reluctant to open their respective domestic markets for certain agricultural commodities. To break the negotiation deadlock, Arthur Dunkel, the Director General of the GATT, put forward a compromise proposal (the Dunkel proposal) which has become {{the basis for the}} final round of talks currently in progress. Among other things, the Dunkel proposal (1991) calls for countries to replace all existing nontariff barriers to trade by tariffs and to ensure <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> to their domestic markets if imports have been less than 5 percent of domestic consumption. Specifically, the Dunkel proposal calls for importing countries in the 1993 starting period to provide a <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> of 3 percent of the domestic consumption in the base period (average of 1986 through 1988 consumption). They will gradually increase the <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> level to 5 percent of the base period domestic consumption by 1999, if base period imports are below these thresholds. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we propose a {{bilateral}} dumping model in which the <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> level is endogenous. Regions compete with one another using Cournot conjectures and engage in interregional dumping as in Brander and Krugman’s (1983) reciprocal dumping model. International trade is hindered by restrictive Tariff rate Quota (TRQs). The model features two regions and one product. We derive {{the conditions under which}} it is optimal to observe interregional trade and those under which trade does not exist. The results show that the world price and the difference in production costs between regions {{play an important role in}} determining whether bilateral trade exists. In the presence of bilateral trade, the region with the largest market size will obtain the largest share of import volumes permitted under the <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> system while in the absence of interregional trade, the distribution of import permits between regions will also depends on the product cost asymmetry. When only the most efficient region exports to the least efficient region, production costs asymmetry, transaction costs and world price level determine whether the smaller or larger region obtains the larger share of product import allowed under <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> commitment. In all cases, we show that in a country like Canada, creation of “artificial barriers” to interprovincial trade of products under supply management system lowers the welfare of at least one of the regions, along with the global welfare...|$|R

40|$|At present {{there are}} 1425 tariff rate quotas (TRQs) {{notified}} by member countries to the World Trade Organization.

This article evaluates the developmental relevance of TRQs and discusses how the various methods TRQ administration methods influence market access in Switzerland for agricultural products from developing countries. The findings show that existing TRQ management in Switzerland is complicated and lacks transparency. Further, the manner in which TRQs are administered results in high transaction costs, a situation that fails to liberate trade opportunities from rents and influences trade flows of the partner countries. Proposed reforms are establishment of a more efficient administrative mechanism, modalities to liberalize trade with TRQs through reduction of out-of-quota tariffs, and capacity building in developing countries; such reforms would maximize market <b>access</b> <b>opportunities</b> from a development perspective. developing countries, Switzerland, tariff rate quotas, Agribusiness, Agricultural Finance, International Development, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

30|$|Tian and Giannakis {{introduced}} {{two kinds}} of compressed sensing methods (called multi-step and one-step) to recover the signal by wavelet approach [5] and then developed the signal recovery idea and performed the distributed compressive spectrum sensing in the cooperative multi-hop CRNs [6]. However, for spectrum sensing and detection, accurately reconstructing the original signal is unnecessary. Following this idea, Polo et al. presented a compressive wideband spectrum sensing scheme by sampling the analog signal using analog-to-information convert and then focused {{on the performance of}} edge spectrum and power spectrum density recovery [7]. The authors in [8, 9] also suggested to only reconstruct the signal’s power spectrum, in order to optimize the sensing performance at the expected probabilities of detection and false alarm. As well known, the final purpose of spectrum sensing is to find the spectrum <b>access</b> <b>opportunities</b> for SUs [1, 5]. Based on this point, all the aforementioned methods, aiming at the signal reconstruction performance in [5, 6] or the sensing performance in [7 – 9], give no considerations to the optimization problem of the spectrum <b>access</b> <b>opportunity.</b> In this paper, we have a further study on this problem, combining the challenge of energy consumption in WSS. We propose a reconstruction structure aiming at optimizing the energy efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of SU’s spectrum <b>access</b> <b>opportunity</b> to the energy consumption.|$|R

The {{international}} dairy sector {{is one of}} the most heavily protected commodity sectors in agriculture. Following the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade liberalization all nontariff barriers to trade were converted, through the process of tariffication, into tariffs. However, in the dairy sector, the border measure most commonly adopted by developed countries was a system of tariff rate quotas. Tariff rate quotas are two-tiered tariffs which allow a small quantity of the product to be imported at a low or zero tariff, while quantities above the <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> amount are charged much higher and often prohibitive tariffs. Tariff rate quotas cause the excess supply curve facing an importing country to be discontinuous at the <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> amount. The objective of this paper is to review key issues related to modeling trade liberalization for the international dairy economy, given the existence of tariff rate quotas and export subsidies.
