Isoamplitudes are drawn on maps of amplitudes (for example, annual amplitudes of air temperature—that is, {{the differences between the}} mean temperatures of the warmest and coldest month). Isanomals are drawn on maps of anomalies (for example, deviations of the mean temperature of each place from the mean temperature of the entire latitudinal zone). Isolines of frequency are drawn on maps showing the frequency of a particular phenomenon (for example, annual number of days with a thunderstorm or snow cover). Isochrones are drawn on maps showing the dates of onset of a given phenomenon (for example, the first frost and appearance or disappearance of the snow cover) or the date of a particular value of a <b>meteorological</b> <b>element</b> {{in the course of a}} year (for example, passing of the mean daily air temperature through zero). Isolines of the mean numerical value of wind velocity or isotachs are drawn on wind maps (charts); the wind resultants and directions of prevailing winds are indicated by arrows of different length or arrows with different plumes; lines of flow are often drawn. Maps of the zonal and meridional components of wind are frequently compiled for the free atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure and wind are usually combined on climatic maps. Wind roses, curves showing the distribution of other meteorological elements, diagrams of the annual course of elements at individual stations, and the like are also plotted on climatic maps.|$|E

30|$|For Alnus, {{the weights}} {{of the past}} {{meteorological}} parameters are somewhat higher with small variability compared {{to those of the}} current ones almost in the whole pollen-free season (Figure  3, 1 st panel from above, left). For Ambrosia, the total weights of the factor loadings for the past meteorological variables are gradually increasing from the first pollen-free day following the last Ambrosia pollen season until the middle of March (Figure  3, 1 st panel from above, right). For Artemisia, the past <b>meteorological</b> <b>elements</b> have a much more important effect on pollen production almost in all the pollen-free period, especially between mid-April and mid-June (Figure  3, 2 nd panel from above, left). For Betula, the effect of the past and current <b>meteorological</b> <b>elements</b> is very similar in the preceding pollen-free season, except the period from August {{until the end of the}} autumn when the difference between the weights of the past and current meteorological parameters is the highest with the bigger weights of the past elements (Figure  3, 2 nd panel from above, right). For Cannabis, the past and current weather conditions have a balanced role, i.e. almost equal weights in the pollen-free period (Figure  3, 3 rd panel from above, left). For Chenopodiaceae family, after finishing the previous pollen season (October 11), the weights of the past <b>meteorological</b> <b>elements</b> are substantially higher than those of the current ones. Whilst, around two months before the current pollen season this difference vanishes (Figure  3, 3 rd panel from above, right). For Juglans and Morus, with very similar curves, after finishing the previous pollen season, the weight of current <b>meteorological</b> <b>elements</b> is higher reaching the maximum weight in early July, while afterwards the difference practically disappears (Figure  3, 4 th panel from above, left and right). Pinus and Plantago genera are sensible especially for the current weather conditions (Figure  2, 1 st panel from above). The past <b>meteorological</b> <b>elements</b> indicate the smallest effect on these taxa of all analyzed in the study. For Platanus, the weights of the current <b>meteorological</b> <b>elements</b> exceed those of the past climate in the summer period (late May – early August), however their values are very similar to each other (Figure  2, 2 nd panel from above, left). For For Poaceae the results are in agreement with our preliminary expectation. Namely, current climate has a higher importance close to the current pollen release; while back in time the role of both the past and current climate varies depending on periods (Figure  2, 2 nd panel from above, right). Populus, the past <b>meteorological</b> <b>elements</b> have higher weights compared to the current climate parameters except 2 – 3 days before the start of the pollen season (Figure  2, 3 rd panel from above, left). For Quercus, the weight of the current <b>meteorological</b> <b>elements</b> is much higher than that of the past climate parameters from mid-May until mid-August.. However, in the remaining period these values are very similar (Figure  2, 3 rd panel from above, right). For Rumex, only very small differences can be observed in the weights of the current and past <b>meteorological</b> <b>elements</b> in the pollen-free period preceding the current pollen season (Figure  2, 4 th panel from above, left). For Taxus, the past <b>meteorological</b> <b>elements</b> have a prominently remarkable role between in the pollen-free period except for a few days before the start of the current pollen season in early February when the current <b>meteorological</b> <b>elements</b> become dominant (Figure  2, 4 th panel from above, right). Tilia seems to be more sensitive to the past weather conditions as the weights of the past <b>meteorological</b> <b>elements</b> is higher than those of the current ones except for several days before the start of pollen season when the current weather conditions become a bit more important (Figure  4, 1 st panel from above, left). For Ulmus, again the major role of the past weather conditions can be identified except for a few days before the start of the current pollen season, when the weights of the current meteorological parameters exceed those of the past ones (Figure  4, 1 st panel from above, right). The shape of the curves for Urtica is the most equalized of all taxa, with very similar weights of the current and past <b>meteorological</b> <b>elements</b> (Figure  4, 2 nd panel from above, left).|$|R

30|$|In the {{proposed}} method, it becomes difficult {{to adopt the}} exhaustive search for determining γ {{when the number of}} meteorological elements becomes larger. Therefore, we will have to solve this problem by using some alternative schemes. First, {{it would be useful to}} limit the number of the meteorological elements used for estimating each target <b>meteorological</b> <b>element.</b> This approach is similar to the feature selection, i.e., we select the elements that are the most useful for estimation of the target <b>meteorological</b> <b>element.</b> It should be noted that in the experiments described in this paper, we simply selected the three elements that tend to affect each other from the view point of meteorology. Second, we can use some alternative selection algorithms of the best results of γ instead of the exhaustive search. Many optimization methods that can avoid an exhaustive search have been proposed, and a genetic algorithm is one of the most traditional optimization approaches. By using such approaches, we can avoid an exhaustive search and enable the use of more meteorological elements for estimating the target meteorological elements. Some other approaches for learning kernels such as the approach in [18] may also solve this problem. This provides a solution to the problem of the need to tune optimal kernel parameters. This method can be easily extended to a supervised scenario, and it has also been reported that it can outperform the conventional multiple kernel learning approaches. Therefore, the introduction of this method will improve prediction performance.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for estimating error degrees in {{numerical weather prediction}} via multiple kernel discriminant analysis (MKDA)-based ordinal regression. The proposed method tries to estimate how large prediction errors will occur in each area from known observed data. Therefore, ordinal regression based on KDA is used for estimating the prediction error degrees. Furthermore, the following points are introduced into the proposed approach. Since several meteorological elements are {{related to each other}} based on atmospheric movements, the proposed method merges such heterogeneous features in the target and neighboring areas based on a multiple kernel algorithm. This approach is based on the characteristics of actual meteorological data. Then, MKDA-based ordinal regression for estimating the prediction error degree of a target <b>meteorological</b> <b>element</b> in each area becomes feasible. Since the amount of training data obtained from known observed data becomes very large in the training stage of MKDA, the proposed method performs simple sampling of those training data {{to reduce the number of}} samples.
