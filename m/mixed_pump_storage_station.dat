40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method to {{calculate}} the best installed capacity of <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> power <b>station.</b> First, we choose the day with maximum load as the typical day for every month and simulate the system running in two cases of whether the <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> power <b>station</b> is put into operation. The difference of the total coal consumption between the two cases is the peak load shifting benefit. Furthermore, we build load model and power generation model to calcu-late the benefit of emergency use and frequency modulation, which are the major projects of dynamic benefits. At last, on the premise of ensuring the system requirements, the developed method employs the maximum benefit of the unit capacity as the objective function {{to get the best}} installed capacity of <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> power <b>station</b> by simulations. Tests on a provincial power grid have shown that the developed method which combines of load characteristics, electric structure and other factors can get the best installed capacity of <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> power <b>station</b> easily and has a certain guiding significance for the planning and construction of the <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> power <b>station...</b>|$|R

5000|$|It is {{important}} to predict demand as precisely as possible as electricity grids are not capable of storing electricity in large quantities and all power stations have a lead-in time before generation can begin. [...] Balancing teams attempt to meet short term fluctuations with [...] "fast reserves" [...] that are quick to come online, backed up with longer term fossil fuel-based [...] "balance mechanism units". [...] The shortest lead-in times are on <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> reservoirs, such as the Dinorwig power station that has the fastest response time of any <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> <b>station</b> {{in the world at}} just 12 seconds to produce 1320 MW. [...] Once the longer term fossil fuel stations, which have response times around half an hour, and nuclear power stations, which can take even longer, come online then <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> <b>stations</b> can be turned off and the water returned to the reservoir.|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Rural area {{often has}} only one {{transmission}} line in connection with main power grid. The safety of critical load cannot be insured. Instead of adding a second transmission line, distributed generation can be installed. In this paper, a hybrid power system is analyzed. It is composed of solar power, wind farm of doubly fed induction generators (DFIG), <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> <b>station,</b> residential load and industry load. Both grid connected operation and islanded operation of this hybrid power system are analyzed. A control strategy is proposed to stabilize this power system under islanded condition without the necessary of central master controller. The water tower with back to back voltage source converter (VSC) is operated as a <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> <b>station</b> under islanded situation, which controls the frequency and voltage of the islanded power system. Wind farm, solar power, and load contribute to frequency and voltage control of the hybrid power system. I...|$|R
