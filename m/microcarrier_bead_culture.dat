40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis serovar E {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{bacterial}} sexually transmitted pathogens. Since it is an obligate intracellular bacterium, efficient colonization of genital mucosal epithelial cells is crucial to the infectious process. Serovar E elementary bodies (EB) metabolically radiolabeled with 35 S-Cys-Met and harvested from <b>microcarrier</b> <b>bead</b> <b>cultures,</b> which significantly improves the infectious EB-to-particle ratio, provided a more accurate picture of the parameters of attachment of EB to human endometrial epithelial cells (HEC- 1 B) than did less infectious 14 C-EB harvested from flask cultures. Binding of serovar E EB was (i) equivalent at 35 and 4 degrees C, (ii) decreased by preexposure of EB to heat or the topical microbicide C 31 G, (iii) comparable among common eukaryotic cell lines (HeLa, McCoy), and (iv) significantly increased to the apical surfaces of polarized cells versus nonpolarized cells. In parallel experiments with C. trachomatis serovar L 2, serovar E attachment was not affected by heparin or heparan sulfate whereas these glucosaminoglycans dramatically reduced serovar L 2 attachment. These data were confirmed by competitive inhibition of serovar E binding and infectivity by excess unlabeled live and UV-inactivated serovar E EB but not by excess serovar L 2 EB. The noninvasive serovar E strains in the lumen of the genital tract enter and exit the apical domains of target columnar epithelial cells to spread canalicularly in an ascending fashion from the lower to the upper genital tract. In contrast, the invasive serovar L 2 strains are primarily submucosal pathogens and likely use the glucosaminoglycans concentrated in the extracellular matrix to colonize the basolateral domains of mucosal epithelia to perpetuate the infectious process...|$|R

MIP- 101 produces CEA when implanted into the peritoneum of nude mice {{but not when}} implanted into subcutaneous tissue. We tested whether MIP- 101 cells may be induced to express CEA when cultured on <b>microcarrier</b> <b>beads</b> in three-dimensional <b>cultures,</b> either in static cultures as non-adherent aggregates or under dynamic conditions in a NASA-designed low shear stress bioreactor. MIP- 101 cells proliferated well under all three conditions and increased CEA and NCA production 3 - 4 fold when grown in three-dimensional cultures compared to MIP- 101 cells growing logarithmically in monolayers. These results suggest that three-dimensional growth in vitro simulates tumor function in vivo and that three-dimensional growth by itself may enhance production of molecules {{that are associated with}} the metastatic process...|$|R
40|$|Suspension culture {{remains a}} popular modality, which manipulates {{mechanical}} culture conditions {{to maintain the}} specialized features of cultured cells. The rotating-wall vessel is a suspension culture vessel optimized to produce laminar flow and minimize the mechanical stresses on cell aggregates in culture. This review summarizes the engineering principles, which allow optimal suspension culture conditions to be established, and the boundary conditions, which limit this process. We suggest that to minimize mechanical damage and optimize differentiation of cultured cells, suspension culture should be performed in a solid-body rotation Couette-flow, zero-headspace culture vessel such as the rotating-wall vessel. This provides fluid dynamic operating principles characterized by 1) solid body rotation about a horizontal axis, characterized by colocalization of cells and aggregates of different sedimentation rates, optimally reduced fluid shear and turbulence, and three-dimensional spatial freedom; and 2) oxygenation by diffusion. Optimization of suspension culture is achieved by applying three tradeoffs. First, terminal velocity should be minimized by choosing <b>microcarrier</b> <b>beads</b> and <b>culture</b> media as close in density as possible. Next, rotation in the rotating-wall vessel induces both Coriolis and centrifugal forces, directly dependent on terminal velocity and minimized as terminal velocity is minimized. Last, mass transport of nutrients to a cell in suspension culture depends on both terminal velocity and diffusion of nutrients. In the transduction of mechanical culture conditions into cellular effects, several lines of evidence support a role for multiple molecular mechanisms. These include effects of shear stress, changes in cell cycle and cell death pathways, and upstream regulation of secondary messengers such as protein kinase C. The discipline of suspension culture needs a systematic analysis {{of the relationship between}} mechanical culture conditions and biological effects, emphasizing cellular processes important for the industrial production of biological pharmaceuticals and devices...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} {{to determine the effect}} of ouabain on the release of relaxing factor(s) from cultured endothelial cells, and its action on the effect of the relaxing factor(s) on arterial smooth muscle. A column of porcine aortic endothelial cells grown on <b>microcarrier</b> <b>beads</b> in suspension <b>culture</b> was perfused with modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution. The release of relaxing factor(s) by the endothelial cells was detected under bioassay conditions by measuring the relaxing activity of the perfusate overflowing a ring of canine coronary artery (without endothelium) contracted with prostaglandin F(2 α). Incubation of the endothelial cells with ouabain did not affect the relaxation of the bioassay ring under basal conditions or upon stimulation of the endothelial cells with ADP but impaired the relaxation induced by bradykinin or the calcium ionophore A 23187. Incubation of the bioassay ring with ouabain reduced the relaxation under basal conditions as well as the relaxation induced by ADP but did not affect the relaxation observed upon stimulation with bradykinin and A 23187 and the endothelium-independent relaxations induced by nitric oxide. These experiments suggest that cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells release two endothelium-derived relaxing factors; one is released under basal conditions and upon stimulation with adenosine diphosphate and the other (which presumably is nitric oxide) upon stimulation with bradykinin and the calcium ionophore A 23187. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Satellite {{cells are}} {{postnatal}} myoblasts {{responsible for providing}} additional nuclei to growing or regenerating muscle cells. Satellite cells retain the capacity to proliferate and differentiate in vitro and therefore provide a useful model to study postnatal muscle development. Most culture systems used to study postnatal muscle development are limited by the two-dimensional (2 -D) confines of the culture dish. Limiting proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells in 2 -D could potentially limit cell-cell contacts important for developing the level of organization in skeletal muscle obtained in vivo. Culturing satellite cells on <b>microcarrier</b> <b>beads</b> suspended in the High-Aspect-Ratio-Vessel (HARV) designed by NASA provides a low shear, three-dimensional (3 -D) environment to study muscle development. Primary cultures established from anterior tibialis muscles of growing rats (approximately 200 gm) were used for all studies and were composed of greater than 75 % satellite cells. Different inoculation densities {{did not affect the}} proliferative potential of satellite cells in the HARV. Plating efficiency, proliferation, and glucose utilization were compared between 2 -D flat culture and 3 -D HARV culture. Plating efficiency (cells attached - cells plated x 100) was similar between the two culture systems. Proliferation was reduced in HARV cultures and this reduction was apparent for both satellite cells and non-satellite cells. Furthermore, reduction in proliferation within the HARV could not be attributed to reduced substrate availability since glucose levels in media from HARV and 2 -D cell culture were similar. Morphologically, <b>microcarrier</b> <b>beads</b> within the HARVS were joined together by cells into three-dimensional aggregates composed of greater than 10 beads/aggregate. Aggregation of beads did not occur in the absence of cells. Myotubes were often seen on individual beads or spanning the surface of two beads.

Microscopy analysis of these cell lines prior to infection revealed morphological differences reminiscent of their in vivo architecture. Upon infection, early chlamydial inclusion distribution was uniform in McCoy cells but patchy in both epithelial cell lines. Although no difference in chlamydial attachment to or entry into the two genital epithelial cell lines was noted, active bacterial genome replication and transcription, as well as initial transformation of elementary bodies to reticulate bodies, were detected earlier in HEC- 1 B than in HeLa cells, suggesting a faster growth, which led to higher progeny counts and titers in HEC- 1 B cells upon completion of the developmental cycle. Chlamydial development in the less relevant McCoy cells was very similar to that in HeLa cells, although higher progeny counts were obtained. In conclusion, this three-dimensional <b>bead</b> <b>culture</b> system represents an improved model for harvesting large quantities of infectious chlamydia progeny from their more natural polarized epithelial host cells...|$|R

40|$|In vitro {{characteristics}} of cardiac cells cultured in simulated microgravity are reported. Tissue culture methods performed at unit gravity constrain cells to propagate, differentiate, and interact in a two-dimensional (2 D) plane. Neonatal rat cardiac cells in 2 D culture organize predominantly as bundles of cardiomyocytes with the intervening areas filled by nonmyocyte cell types. Such cardiac cell cultures respond predictably to {{the addition of}} exogenous compounds, {{and in many ways}} they represent an excellent in vitro model system. The gravity-induced 2 D organization of the cells, however, does not accurately reflect the distribution of cells in the intact tissue. We have begun characterizations of a three-dimensional (3 D) culturing system designed to mimic microgravity. The NASA-designed High-Aspect Ratio Vessel (HARV) bioreactors provide a low shear environment that allows cells to be cultured in static suspension. HARV- 3 D cultures were prepared on <b>microcarrier</b> <b>beads</b> and compared to control- 2 D cultures using a combination of microscopic and biochemical techniques.

40|$|The {{growth and}} repair of adult {{skeletal}} muscle are {{due in part}} to activation of muscle precursor cells, commonly known as satellite cells or myoblasts. These cells are responsive to a variety of environmental cues, including mechanical stimuli. The overall goal of the research is to examine the role of mechanical signalling mechanisms in muscle growth and plasticity through utilisation of cell culture systems where other potential signalling pathways (i. e. chemical and electrical stimuli) are controlled. To explore the effects of decreased mechanical loading on muscle differentiation, mammalian myoblasts are cultured in a bioreactor (rotating cell culture system), a model that has been utilised to simulate microgravity. C 2 C 12 murine myoblasts are cultured on <b>microcarrier</b> <b>beads</b> in a bioreactor and followed throughout differentiation as they form a network of multinucleated myotubes. In comparison with three-dimensional control cultures that consist of myoblasts cultured on <b>microcarrier</b> <b>beads</b> in teflon bags, myoblasts cultured in the bioreactor exhibit an attenuation in differentiation. This is demonstrated by reduced immunohistochemical staining for myogenin and alpha-actinin. Western analysis shows a decrease, in bioreactor cultures compared with control cultures, in levels of the contractile proteins myosin (47 % decrease, p < 0. 01) and tropomyosin (63 % decrease, p < 0. 01). Hydrodynamic measurements indicate that the decrease in differentiation may be due, at least in part, to fluid stresses acting on the myotubes. In addition, constraints on aggregate size imposed by the action of fluid forces in the bioreactor affect differentiation. These results may have implications for muscle growth and repair during spaceflight...|$|R

Developing countermeasures for atrophy in spaceflight will require extensive screening of promising pharmaceuticals for efficacy, safety, contraindications, and dosage schedule. Due {{to the cost of}} spaceflight and limited crew time aboard the International Space Station, high throughput screening of pharmaceuticals in actual microgravity conditions is not economically feasible. We present an optimized ground-based model that induces similar genetic markers of atrophy as seen in spaceflight. To model the microgravity conditions on the International Space Station, murine C 2 C 12 myoblasts were cultured in a rotary cell culture system. Hydrogel encapsulation was compared against <b>microcarrier</b> <b>beads</b> as a substrate for C 2 C 12 muscle cells. <b>Microcarrier</b> <b>beads</b> are commonly used for suspension culture of adherent cell lines. However, the irregular monolayer that forms on the surface of clustered microcarriers may not accurately model solid muscle tissue. In contrast, encapsulation of differentiated muscle cells in an alginate hydrogel creates a three dimensional tissue model of consistent size and cell density. Changes due to the spaceflight model were characterized qRT-PCR for the atrophy markers MuRF 1 and MAFbx. The muscle proteins myosin and tropomyosin were assessed via Western blot. Encapsulated cells are expected to produce higher levels of MuRF 1 and MAFbx than cells cultured on microcarriers. Myosin and tropomyosin levels are also expected to be higher in encapsulated cells, indicating a larger percentage of differentiation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess whether {{simulated}} conditions of microgravity induce changes in the production of progesterone by luteal cells of the pregnant rat ovary using an in vitro model system. The microgravity environment was simulated using either a high aspect ratio vessel (HARV) bioreactor with free fall or a clinostat without free fall of cells. A mixed population of luteal cells isolated from the corpora lutea of day 8 pregnant rats was attached to cytodex <b>microcarrier</b> <b>beads</b> (cytodex 3). These anchorage dependent cells were placed in equal numbers in the HARV or a spinner flask control vessel in culture conditions. It was found that HARV significantly reduced the daily production of progesterone from day 1 through day 8 compared to controls. Scanning electron microscopy showed that cells attached to the <b>microcarrier</b> <b>beads</b> throughout the duration of the experiment in both types of culture vessels. Cells cultured in chamber slide flasks and placed in a clinostat yielded similar results when compared to those in the HARV.

Further, the relative amount of Oil Red-O staining per milligram of protein was found to be higher in the clinostat than in the control cells at 48 h. It is speculated that the increase in the level of lipid content in cells subjected to simulated conditions of microgravity may be due to a disruption in cholesterol transport and/or lesions in the steroidogenic pathway leading to a fall in the synthesis of progesterone. Additionally, the fall in progesterone in simulated conditions of microgravity could be due to apoptosis of luteal cells...|$|R

The initial phase of this project tested the efficacy of simulated microgravity for the cultivation and differentiation of human colon carcinoma in rotating wall vessels (RWV's) on <b>microcarrier</b> <b>beads.</b> The RWV's simulate microgravity by randomizing the gravity vector in an aqueous medium under a low shear stress environment in unit gravity. This simulation achieves approximately a one-fifth g environment that allows cells to 'float' and form three-dimensional relationships with less shear stress than in other stirred aqueous medium bioreactors. In {{the second phase of}} this project we assessed the ability of human colon carcinoma lines to adhere to various substrates because adhesion is the first event that must occur to create three-dimensional masses. Finally, we tested growth factor production in the last phase of this project...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a horizontally rotating bioreactor useful {{for carrying out}} cell and tissue culture. For processing of mammalian cells, the system is sterilized and fresh fluid medium, <b>microcarrier</b> <b>beads,</b> and cells are admitted to completely fill the cell culture vessel. An oxygen containing gas is admitted to {{the interior of the}} permeable membrane which prevents air bubbles from being introduced into the medium. The cylinder is rotated at a low speed within an incubator so that the circular motion of the fluid medium uniformly suspends the microbeads throughout the cylinder during the cell growth period. The unique design of this cell and tissue culture device was initially driven by two requirements imposed by its intended use for feasibility studies for three dimensional culture of living cells and tissues in space by JSC. They were compatible with microgravity and simulation of microgravity in one G. The vessels are designed to approximate the extremely quiescent low shear environment obtainable in space...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that endothelium-derived relaxing factor exhibits properties of nitric oxide. Like nitric oxide, it inhibits platelet function and mediates its effects by elevating intracellular cyclic GMP. In this study we have investigated the role of reduced thiol in the mechanism of action of endothelium-derived relaxing factor on platelets. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were grown on <b>microcarrier</b> <b>beads</b> and pretreated with aspirin before use. Endothelial cells stimulated with bradykinin or exposed to stirred medium expressed a dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation that was potentiated by the reduced thiol, /V-acetykysteine. Endothelial cell-mediated platelet inhibition was attenuated by methylene blue. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by endothelial cells {{was associated with a}} rise in platelet intracellular cyclic GMP, an effect that was enhanced by JV-acetylcysteine. These data show that 1) the reduced thiol N-acetylcysteine potentiates platelet inhibition by endothelium-derived relaxing factor and 2) this effect is associated with increasing intracellular platelet cyclic GMP levels. {Circulation Research 1989; 65 : 789 - 795) Endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) is an endogenous vasodilator that hasrecently been characterized in detail.
