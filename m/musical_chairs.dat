In 1932 he starred in Richard of Bordeaux by Elizabeth MacKintosh. This, a retelling in modern language {{of the events of}} Richard II, was greeted as the most successful historical play since Shaw's Saint Joan nine years earlier, more faithful to the events than Shakespeare had been. After an uncertain start in the West End it rapidly became a sell-out hit and played in London and on tour over the next three years.|$|E

40|$|Intermezzo {{seemed a}} fitting title for this work. Italian {{literally}} for interlude, intermezzo describes an act connecting two larger pieces together. In a broader sense, I interpreted {{the act of}} networking to be the connecting piece {{in the process of}} hiring entertainment from music agencies for higher education institutions. This thesis covers only a small perspective of the college entertainment industry and is not intended as a national study. I have targeted my research to focus on small colleges and universities within the state of Oregon. Small higher education institutions, such as Linfield College, have been conducting business with independent musicians and musicians represented by music agencies {{for an extended period of}} time in order to provide entertainment for its student body. The position of the <b>Musical</b> Entertainment <b>Chair</b> for the Linfield Activities Board was established to book both professional and student musicians for weekly performances. Presently, there are no written guidelines for this position. If students filling this position lack a music or business background, the position of <b>Musical</b> Entertainment <b>Chair</b> is a daunting challenge. The purpose of this thesis is to provide a means for students to acquire more easily the tools to be successful as <b>Musical</b> Entertainment <b>Chair</b> or as a supplement for individuals interested or employed in similar positions at colleges or universities. Appendix A: The <b>Musical</b> Entertainment <b>Chair</b> Guide will be especially beneficial to students employed as the <b>Musical</b> Entertainment <b>chair</b> for the Linfield Activities Board or at similar positions at other institutions...|$|R

My bath was of jade; my table a long one of ebony inlaid with ivory, with puffing cherub faces at each corner representing the four winds. My own few possessions, I must confess, looked not only worn but provincial by comparison. But I never surprised myself actually talking to any of Mrs Monnerie's exquisite novelties as to my other dumb, old, wooden friends. She delighted in them far more than I.|$|R

25|$|In 1934, 15-year-old Eva Duarte (later Eva Duarte de Perón) {{lives in}} the provincial town of Junín, and longs to seek a better life in Buenos Aires. Eva {{falls in love with}} a tango singer, Agustín Magaldi, after she meets him at one of his shows ("On This Night of a Thousand Stars"). Eva persuades Magaldi into taking her with him to Buenos Aires and though he is {{initially}} resistant, he eventually accepts ("Eva, Beware of the City"). Upon her arrival at the city, Eva sings about her hopes and ambitions of glory as an actress ("Buenos Aires"). After Magaldi leaves her, and Che relates the story of how Eva goes through several relationships with increasingly influential men, becoming a model, actress and radio personality ("Goodnight and Thank You"). He then tells of both a right-wing coup in 1943 and Eva's success, implying that Argentine politics and Eva's career may soon coincide. Che also makes a point to introduce the figure of Colonel Juan Domingo Perón, an ambitious military colonel who was making his way up the Argentine political ladder ("The Lady's Got Potential"). In a game of <b>musical</b> <b>chairs</b> that represents the rise of political figures, Perón and other military figures compete for power and exhibit their political strategy ("The Art of the Possible").|$|E
500|$|According to Janet Reitman, in {{the late}} fall of 2004 Miscavige called {{together}} 70 senior Church executives {{in a pair of}} double-wide trailers normally used as the international management team's offices.

40|$|In this paper, we {{document}} {{the importance of}} individual variations in wage outcomes of displacement, {{as opposed to the}} change in the wage distribution itself. Most of the research on displaced workers has focused on analyzing changes in the wage distribution. We show that, while the changes in the distribution of wages before and after displacement are real, as shown in many previous studies, they are negligible compared to the enormous game of <b>musical</b> <b>chair</b> taking place between workers within these distributions. When studying displaced workers, we show that, from an individual worker's point of view, the change in the distribution of wages matters much less than the draw they will make within these distributions. We show that workers suffer large movements within the distribution of wages before and after displacement. Finally, we show that even with reasonable levels of risk aversion, these large movements inside the wage distribution translate into important losses of utility for the workers. ...|$|R
