In the period around 1918 he showed {{a great interest in}} the history of chemistry. This resulted in a number of publications on this subject, which show all the characteristics of Jaeger's approach to science. He was a positivist scientist, who stressed the importance of experimentation. He used the important developments in contemporary chemistry, especially the theory of atomic structure and the elements, to assess the merits of past chemists. Although he claimed to rate every historical period at its true value, he was in fact exalting the chemistry of his own time...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{quest for}} high-mobility MOSFET channel {{material}} has led electronic material researchers to replace silicon by germanium in advanced technologies. This {{field of research}} {{has been the subject}} of many studies in recent years (see for example [1]). One of the main problem of the rise of germanium as a possible material is its oxide, GeO 2, and its interface with the latter, because of the larger defects density in Ge:GeO 2 than in Si:SiO 2. In this study, we performed first principles calculations on defects and dopants in crystalline and amorphous GeO 2. Calculations based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT) using the Local Density Approximation (LDA) are performed through the PWscf code from the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution [2]. These calculations allow us to have access to the atomic configurations of defects and dopants and to their energy properties. Starting from the wavefunctions and from the atomic configurations obtained in DFT, we use the SaX code version 2. 0 [3] to apply the GW approximation to obtain a right value of the band gap and to evaluate the effects of point defects, dopants and impurities on the electronic properties of GeO 2. Finally, the optical properties (particularly the absorption spectra) of pure and doped GeO 2 are given including excitonic effects with resolution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). A particular attention will be given to the levels introduced by dopants and defects in the electronic structure of Germania and their effects in terms of charge capture will be discussed. We already successfully applied this methodology to oxygen vacancies in pure and Germanium doped silica [4] and the results obtained will be discussed and compared to the results coming from this previous study and from literature.

40|$|Are liquid {{crystals}} living organisms? In 1888 the Austrian botanist F. Reinitzer {{made the}} observation that the solid compound cholesteryl-benzoate changes - when melting at 145. 5 °C - into a cloudy liquid, that, however, turns into a clear liquid at 178. 5 °C and higher temperatures. The cloudy liquid seemed to be doubly refracting. Soon {{a number of these}} so-called 'liquid crystals' were discovered; in 1908 D. Vorlander, professor of organic chemistry at Halle, described more than 250 of these substances. It was O. Lehmann, professor of physics at Aachen (1885), Dresden (1888) and Karlsruhe (1889), who immediately after Reinitzer's observation began a systematic study of these liquid crystals. In The Netherlands the Amsterdam professor of physical chemistry H. W. Bakhuis Roozeboom was interested in liquid crystals, in particular because of their place in his phase system. F. <b>M.</b> <b>Jaeger,</b> at that time teaching chemistry in a secondary school in Zaandam (near Amsterdam) and working as an unpaid university lecturer at the Amsterdam university (by recommendation of Bakhuis Roozeboom), investigated liquid crystals (1906), as did a number of doctoral students (A. C. de Kock, 1903; A. Prins, 1907). At the university of Utrecht L. S. Ornstein, professor of physics, gave the study of liquid crystals a prominent place in his research programme. The discovery of liquid crystals, which seemed to be able to grow, move, divide, copulate, and so on, led to a discussion on the nature of these substances. Time and again Lehmann called them 'apparently living crystals', although without considering them as 'real living beings'. In his book Flüssige Kristalle und die Theorien des Lebens (1906), Lehmann proved to be an obvious adherent of the monistic views of the biologist E. Haeckel. Haeckel considered the existence of liquid crystals as proof of the unity between the inorganic and the organic world that he believed in so strongly. In his last book, Kristallseelett. Studiën über das Anorganische Leben (1917), he considered liquid crystals a real form of life, as did F. Rinne, professor of mineralogy and petrography, as late as in the nineteen thirties...|$|E
