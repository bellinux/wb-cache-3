40|$|Includes bibliographical references. “’Some of Us Just Like to Read’: Lady Gaga’s Pastiche and the Rhizome” explores intersections {{of network}} theory, new media, {{contemporary}} art and visual culture, and post-modern critical discourses. It attempts {{to characterize the}} productive tendencies of contemporary pop culture, using Lady Gaga as a lens through which these tendencies can be observed. It pays {{particular attention to the}} correlation(s) between the structure of the Internet, the exchange of texts and images within such a structure, and how Lady Gaga embodies this dynamic. This paper demonstrates, through both a critique of the concept of pastiche under current cultural conditions and a close examination of some specific performances, that Lady Gaga’s is a pastiche informed by a historical and cultural awareness, which turns pastiche into an affirmative, indexical reaction to the socio-cultural condition of the digital age. Ultimately, I argue that Lady Gaga’s tendency to pastiche reflects the structure of the current cultural moment; and that, by embodying a pastiched image, she encourages <b>multifaceted</b> <b>interpretations</b> of her music, fashion, and performances from an equally multifaceted audience.

40|$|As {{human society}} becomes {{increasingly}} pluricultural and more complex, we need resources {{to educate people}} about intercultural communication and cultural otherness. Holliday, Hyde and Kullman’s new book Intercultural Communication: An Advanced Resource Book responds to this need by providing a rich learning and research resource for all students, not only those learning another language, who will inevitably work and live in pluricultural contexts. The book provides a new and much-needed contribution to the literature in the field by positioning an exploration of intercultural understanding and communication within the disciplines of cultural studies, anthropology and ethnography. As the authors argue, ‘the book is not based upon the principle that cultural differences exist as real and tangible entities, but are inter-subjective and negotiated processes (admittedly affected by power structures) ’ (p. xv). The authors work from the tenet that all communication is intercultural. Therefore, the book is about ‘developing skilled communication strategies and principles in a globalizing world’ (p. xv). Students learn how culture is (re) constructed and (re) negotiated in everyday communication with cultural others through examples and texts that encourage <b>multifaceted</b> <b>interpretations</b> and analyses, thus avoiding the essentialising or stereotyping of people, communication and events...|$|E
40|$|In {{this chapter}} I discuss {{research}} which explored student’s experiences of assessment and feedback from a phenomenographic perspective and propose a conceptual six-stage cyclical assessment and feedback model. Data indicated a <b>multifaceted</b> <b>interpretation</b> {{of the student}} experience suggesting that a student’s achievement outcome, relative to their pre-determined expectation level, regulates their emotional reaction and subsequent feedback utilisation. The phenomenographic outcome space (Åkerlind, 2005) revealed five categories of description (rationalising, needy, low achiever, emotionally changeable and high achiever). The chapter explores {{the implications of this}} outcome space in relation to how students’ utilised the feedback they received. In light of such findings, implications for practice are discussed indicating that grade outcome was an extremely powerful construct which seemed to foster both adaptive and maladaptive emotions and subsequent assessment-related behaviours. In conclusion, I suggest that understanding students’ individual needs through fostering lecturer and student relationships, alongside dialogic feedback opportunities, may help to improve a student’s propensity to utilise the feedback received...|$|R
40|$|Measures of {{consumer}} confidence, {{such as the}} Index of Consumer Sentiment, have gained an important pragmatic role in describing the economic climate of a country. Being a quantitative measure, {{the nature of the}} index has long been taken for granted, without questioning what is the real meaning of «consumer confidence» for the actors involved, how do they define the idea of being confident about the economy, and why do they respond in a certain way to the items of the index. Given the lack of qualitative studies that could help understanding better {{the point of view of}} the respondents, the present explorative and cross-cultural study aims to deepen and compare the meaning {{of consumer}} confidence and the processes that lie behind the answers given by the interviewers to the index items. In order to accomplish this, semi-structured interviews have been conducted in two countries with contrasting economic conditions: Italy and Australia. Although the nature of this research is explorative and circumstantial, results show a <b>multifaceted</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the «consumer confidence» and slightly different cognitive processes in answering the items of the index; this suggests a possible revision of the index itself...|$|R
40|$|The pakhāvaj {{occupies}} {{a unique position}} in the classical music scene of contemporary India. Identified with the ancient mṛdaṅga and associated with kings and gods, played in the Hindustani tradition of the court dhrupad and in the temple music of various sects, {{it is the most}} respected of the Indian drums by musicians as well as the most authoritative, according to textual sources; it is an auspicious drum and multiple origin myths explain its creation; its repertoire includes compositions which musicians connect to literature in Sanskrit or vernacular languages and to prayer. Notwithstanding its relevance in Indian music, there are no specific studies on the pakhāvaj and above all about its language, repertoire, and its unique position connecting sacred and secular music. This dissertation fills the gap with a study of the pakhāvaj of Nathdwara, its history, aesthetics and repertoire. Furthermore, joining ethnographic, historical, religious and iconographic perspectives, it provides a <b>multifaceted</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the role and function of the pakhāvaj in royal courts, temples and contemporary stages, and the first analysis of the visual and narrative contents of its repertoire. It also contributes {{to the understanding of the}} language, idea and role of drums and drumming in Indian court and temple music, and their relationship over the last two millennia. ...|$|R
40|$|Assumptions {{underlying}} the multifaceted, hierarchical structure of self-efficacy previously hypothesized by R. Shavelson, J. Hubner, and G. Stanton (1976) for {{the construct of}} self-concept were tested. The self-efficacy interpretation of the Science Self-Efficacy Scale (H. Kennedy, 1996), a relatively new measure, was studied with 331 (151 female and 180 male) college students and multiple measures of science, mathematics, and self-regulated learning self-efficacy facets. Results support a <b>multifaceted,</b> hierarchical <b>interpretation.</b> A second-order self-efficacy latent named academic self-efficacy was shown to be reflected by the three first-order self-efficacy factors of science, mathematics, and self-regulated learning.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a comprehensive {{account of the}} complex relationship between the British government and the domestic military-naval arms industry from the armistice in 1918 until the period of rearmament in the 1930 s. Challenging traditional 'declinist' assumptions, it offers a <b>multifaceted</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the industry's strengths and weaknesses and its place in national security. In this regard, British governments always prioritised national interests over the private armament manufacturers' particular concerns and never formulated a specific policy to help them adjust to peacetime conditions. Indeed, the wartime experience of industrial mobilisation – the mass production of war material by ordinary firms – made specialist arms producers appear less important in supply planning: a view that proved more important than disarmament and retrenchment in damaging state-industry relations and, together with Britain's liberal economic traditions, helped to foster an enduring but exaggerated sense of relative weakness. Faced with the government's apparent indifference, the overextended arms industry underwent comprehensive internal reorganisation, led by Vickers and supported hesitantly by the Bank of England. This reduced {{the overall number of}} manufacturers but it also brought modernisation and a comparatively efficient nucleus for emergency expansion. Internationally, British firms retained a large share of the global arms market despite rising competition. Policymakers rarely accepted widespread public criticism that private armaments manufacture and trading were immoral but believed that the League of Nations' ambition to enforce all-encompassing international controls posed a far greater risk to British security. Although the government imposed unilateral arms trade regulations to facilitate political objectives, and was forced to address outraged popular opinion, neither seriously damaged the manufacturers' fortunes as the country moved towards rearmament. Indeed, the arms industry was never simply a victim of government policy but instead pursued an independent and ultimately successful peacetime strategy, before rearmament led to a cautious renewal of state-industry relations...|$|R
40|$|Whilst at University {{students}} will experience many instances of feedback on their work. Quite often such feedback is facilitated by academic lecturers {{in the hope}} that the student will utilise this and improve in their next assessment (Hester, 2001). Often feedback does not have the desired effect and is unpredictable in terms of enhancing a student’s motivation, self-confidence and subsequent effort in future assessments. The thesis reports the findings from three studies. Primarily the present thesis, inspired by phenomenography, explored student’s appraisal, comprehension and utilisation of feedback. The thesis also explored lecturer’s responses to the observed student experiences in order to offer comparative research findings. The primary data collection method utilised within the thesis was one-to-one interviews however in order to stimulate discussion prior to interview visual representations were employed. In the data collection with students (study two) a drawing activity took place prior to the interview. In the data collection with lecturers’ (study three) videos of student’s responses to feedback were shown to the lecturers. The interviews in study two were subjected to thematic data analysis and revealed 8 main themes for the students (Lecturers, Emotions, Feedback Cognitions, Efficacy Cognitions, Draft Work, Motivation, Effort and Grades) and 6 main themes for the lecturers (Efficacy Cognitions, Student Autonomy, Problems with Feedback, Effort Conceptions, Feedback Mechanisms and Understanding Students). The findings from study two with students indicated a <b>multifaceted</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the student experience. The outcome space revealed five categories of description (Broken relationship, needy, low achiever, emotionally charged and high achiever). The structure of the variation revealed a hierarchically inclusive pattern indicating how varying patterns of behaviour and emotional reactions interact to affect the students processing and subsequent utilisation of the feedback received. In study three with the lecturers, similarities in conceptions of feedback alongside mismatches between lecturers and students were very apparent. Conclusively the thesis suggests that understanding students individually through fostering lecturer and student relationships, alongside dialogic feedback, help to improve the student’s propensity to utilise the feedback received...|$|R
40|$|The almanac genre was {{immensely popular}} {{throughout}} {{the seventeenth and}} eighteenth centuries. Yet published almanacs for women were nonexistent {{at the turn of the}} eighteenth century. This dissertation, drawing on archival research undertaken in Great Britain and North America, foregrounds The Ladies’ Diary, a pioneering almanac for women, from its founding in 1704 until 1753, a period when the publication’s character and influence were established. Though scholars increasingly acknowledge the significance of almanacs as cultural catalysts, they have rarely attended to the eighteenth-century almanac for women. My examination contextualizes the genre broadly according to its instructional, creative, and social functions. The Diary was one of the longest running publications of the eighteenth century, allowing for the development of an interactive mode of editorship and of reader agency, and the popularization of subject matter such as the enigma poem. The Diary’s expansion of audience and content enabled women, among other contributors, to mark their presence as almanac readers, writers, and even self-reflexive editors. While most critics of this almanac have discussed its public value as a mathematical magazine, the Diary invites a more <b>multifaceted</b> <b>interpretation.</b> My Introduction presents the scholarly foundation and context surrounding the emergence of the almanac for women that serves as the framework for this thesis. Chapter One attends to seventeenth-century precursors of the Ladies’ Diary, astrological and burlesque almanacs that incorporated discursive female tropes. Early almanacs by women are also examined here. Chapter Two introduces the Diary in relation to public perceptions of the almanac genre, underscoring its originator’s innovative editorial methodology (1704 - 1713). The chapter also invokes eighteenth-century periodicals for comparison and to demonstrate patterns of influence. Chapter Three focuses on the editorial shifts within the Diary that led to its expanded and then compromised cultural capital (1714 - 1753). It also explores the complex position of the female almanac editor (1744 - 1753). Chapter Four studies the construction of the Diary’s audience and traces its actual readers. It then analyzes the readers’ favored genre, the enigma. The dissertation concludes with an overview of the originality and significance of the Diary...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{conceptual}} cyclical assessment and feedback model which attempts to further understand the problematic nature of feedback within higher education. Whilst at University students experience many instances of feedback on their work. Quite often such feedback is facilitated by academic lecturers via a monologic transmission process, {{in the hope}} that the student will utilise this and improve in their next assessment. Frequently lecturers report that feedback does not always have the desired effect of improving a student’s subsequent performance (Hounsell, 1987). It also appears that the student’s emotional response, motivation, self-confidence and subsequent effort deployment in future assessments following feedback is unpredictable and warrants further consideration. In response to such problems, the present research explored student’s experiences of assessment and feedback from a phenomenographic perspective. Twenty undergraduate social sciences students, studying at an English University were asked to pictorially represent their experiences of assessment and feedback and participate in a 1 - 2 - 1 interview. The interview data were subjected to thematic data analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) and revealed 8 main themes (Lecturers, Emotions, Feedback Cognitions, Efficacy Cognitions, Draft Work, Motivation, Effort and Grades). The findings from this analysis indicate a <b>multifaceted</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the student experience and as such a six stage conceptual cyclical assessment and feedback model is proposed. The conceptual model indicates that a student’s achievement outcome, relative to their pre-determined expectation level, regulates their emotional reaction and subsequent feedback related cognitions. The phenomenographic outcome space (Åkerlind, 2002) revealed five categories of description (broken relationship, needy, low achiever, emotionally charged and high achiever). The structure of the variation indicates a hierarchically inclusive pattern, representing how varying forms of behaviour and emotional reactions interact to affect the students processing and subsequent utilisation of the feedback received. The results of the study also suggest that grade outcome was a powerful construct which seemed to foster both adaptive and maladaptive emotions and behaviours. In conclusion the study suggests that understanding students’ individual needs through fostering lecturer and student relationships, alongside dialogic feedback, helps to improve students’ propensity to utilise the feedback received...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{definition}} of the terroir concept {{is one of the}} most debated issues in oenology and viticulture. The dynamic interaction among diverse factors including the environment, the grapevine plant and the imposed viticultural techniques means that the wine produced in a given terroir is unique. However, there is an increasing interest to define and quantify the contribution of individual factors to a specific terroir objectively. Here, we characterized the metabolome and transcriptome of berries from a single clone of the Corvina variety cultivated in seven different vineyards, located in three macrozones, over a 3 -year trial period. RESULTS: To overcome the anticipated strong vintage effect, we developed statistical tools that allowed us to identify distinct terroir signatures in the metabolic composition of berries from each macrozone, and from different vineyards within each macrozone. We also identified non-volatile and volatile components of the metabolome which are more plastic and therefore respond differently to terroir diversity. We observed some relationships between the plasticity of the metabolome and transcriptome, allowing a <b>multifaceted</b> scientific <b>interpretation</b> of the terroir concept. CONCLUSIONS: Our experiments with a single Corvina clone in different vineyards have revealed the existence of a clear terroir-specific effect on the transcriptome and metabolome which persists over several vintages and allows each vineyard to be characterized by the unique profile of specific metabolites.

30|$|To summarize, while {{software}} licenses {{determine the}} many rights of users to copy, modify and distribute an Open Source software, {{they are only}} one component in the mix. A community’s governance model defines how external stakeholders can view and influence the development project. Its openness or closeness is determined by access to tasks and transparency of knowledge to external contributors to {{the current state of}} the community and its activities. Managing a hybrid Open Source collaboration requires understanding and decisions on how “open” or “closed” a development project is for external contributors [29]. This degree of openness is <b>multifaceted,</b> and its <b>interpretation</b> varies according to the viewpoint. The main contribution of our paper is to illustrate how openness and closeness can manifest in the core of the development community - at the level of the software development process. To do this, we report empirical evidence from six hybrid OSS projects, highlighting how knowledge and access of development tasks can be used as leverages for openness.|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need to calibrate microbial community profiles obtained through next generation sequencing (NGS) with relevant taxonomic identities of the microbes, and to further associate these identities with phenotypic attributes. Phenotype Microarray (PM) techniques provide a semi-high throughput assay for characterization and monitoring the microbial cellular phenotypes. Here, we present detailed descriptions of two different PM protocols used in our recent studies on fungal endophytes of forest trees, and highlight the benefits and limitations of this technique. We found that the PM approach enables effective screening of substrate utilization by endophytes. However, the technical limitations are <b>multifaceted</b> and the <b>interpretation</b> of the PM data challenging. For the best result, we recommend that the growth conditions for the fungi are carefully standardized. In addition, rigorous replication and control strategies should be employed whether using pre-configured, commercial microwell-plates or in-house designed PM plates for targeted substrate analyses. With these precautions, the PM technique is a valuable tool to characterize the metabolic capabilities of individual endophyte isolates, or successional endophyte communities identified by NGS, allowing a functional interpretation of the taxonomic data. Thus, PM approaches can provide valuable complementary information for NGS studies of fungal endophytes in forest trees...|$|R
5000|$|The {{central issue}} in the {{controversy}} over the Auschwitz cross was articulated by the author and former Catholic priest James Carroll: [...] If Jewish responses to the Holocaust, which range from piety to nihilism, are complex and <b>multifaceted,</b> Christian <b>interpretations</b> of the near elimination of Jews from Europe, however respectfully put forth, must inevitably be even more problematic. The Auschwitz cross signifies the problem: When suffering is seen to serve a universal plan of salvation, its particular character as tragic and evil is always diminished. The meaningless can be made to shimmer with an eschatological hope, and at Auschwitz this can seem like blasphemy. ...Once, for Christians to speak among ourselves about the murder of six million as a kind of crucifixion would have seemed an epiphany of compassion, paying the Jews the highest tribute, as if the remnant of Israel had at last become, in this way, the Body of Christ. Yet such spiritualizing can appear to do what should have been impossible, which is to make the evil worse: the elimination of Jewishness from the place where Jews were eliminated.The Body of Christ? If Jesus had been bodily at Auschwitz, as protesting Jews insisted, he would have died an anonymous victim with a number on his arm, that is all. And he would have done so not as the Son of God, not as the redeemer of humankind, not as the Jewish Messiah, but simply as a Jew. And in a twist of history folding back on itself, his crime would have been tied to the cross — [...] "He killed our God!" [...] That indictment, first brought as an explicit charge of deicide as early as the second century by a bishop, Melito of Sardis, was officially quashed by the bishops of the Second Vatican Councilin 1965, yet it remains the ground of all Jew hatred. That, at bottom, is why it is inconceivable that any Jew should look with equanimity on a cross at Auschwitz, and why no Christian should be able to behold it there as anything but a blow to conscience.

40|$|On July 28, 1998 {{a devastating}} {{accident}} {{occurred at the}} Test Reactor Area of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). The accident cost a man his life and caused injury to others. In addition to the significant human loss, Lockheed Martin (LMITCO) experienced economic losses that reached millions of dollars. LMITCO eventually lost the managing and operating contract of a premier Department of Energy Laboratory. Just as with the INEEL, companies throughout industry today must face an ever increasingly complex world of government alphabet soup of regulations—OSHA, CAA, TSCA, FIFRA, ADA, and more. For businesses, non-compliance can quickly evaporate profits. For humans, mistakes can seriously affect health, and some work areas are so complicated that a single event could cost human life. Finally, adherence to the regulations can protect {{the community and the}} environment. Compliance with regulations is essential and <b>multifaceted.</b> Regulations require <b>interpretation</b> into company policy. Policies must be implemented as standard work practices. The workforce must be trained to follow the procedures. Management must coordinate flow down of requirements and policy for standardized work planning processes and consistent compliance with regulations. Implementing controls to ensure absolute compliance can be a very costly and cumbersome effort, thus, a graded approach is necessary to ensure cost effectiveness and relevance to actual work. The INEEL has developed technology for hazard evaluation and work planning called the Hazards Identification and Mitigation System. The HIM System is a web-based expert system that is available to all INEEL employees through the company Intranet. This tool simplifies and streamlines work planning by using a graded approach to standardize practices. The tool assists in evaluating hazards and ascertaining the required rigor for planning work. The tool integrates the knowledge of INEEL and DOE experts and previously proven review checklists and processes. The manual process is lengthy—sometimes taking 12 to 18 hours to complete. As such, it is difficult, prone to errors, and very tempting to shortcut. Automation of this process through the HIM system reduced a monumental hazard identification task for each work order, into a streamlined, efficient, and accurate process that can be completed in less than one hour. The result is that the process gets done, the regulations are met, and risk to human life is reduced...|$|R
