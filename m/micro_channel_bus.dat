5000|$|Micro Channel architecture, or the <b>Micro</b> <b>Channel</b> <b>bus,</b> was a {{proprietary}} 16- or 32-bit parallel computer bus introduced by IBM in 1987 {{which was used}} on PS/2 and other computers until the mid-1990s. Its name is commonly abbreviated as [...] "MCA", although not by IBM. In IBM products, it superseded the ISA bus and was itself subsequently superseded by the PCI bus architecture.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Micro Channel 370" [...] Models 010, 012, 014 (later 110, 112, 114) ES/9371 {{introduced}} in 1990 used the <b>Micro</b> <b>Channel</b> <b>bus</b> and a 386 CPU for input/output (I/O) processing. Additionally, a dual-processor model was offered, providing a second 386 CPU for DOS and OS/2 applications, implementing a high-speed {{link between the}} processors. With the models mentioned, APPC support was added, using LU6.2 based on SNA PU2.1.|$|E
5000|$|MPU-IMC: for the IBM PS/2's <b>Micro</b> <b>Channel</b> Architecture <b>bus.</b> In earlier models both I/O {{address and}} IRQ were {{hardcoded}} to IRQ 2 (causing {{serious problems with}} the hard disk as it also uses that IRQ); in later models the IRQ could be set with a jumper. It had a 9-pin female connector for the breakout box[...] Due to the incompatibility of IRQ 2/9 (and potentially I/O addresses) between the MPU-IMC and IBM PS/2 MCA models certain games will not work with MPU-401.|$|R
50|$|Sound Blaster MCV, CT5320, was {{a version}} created for IBM PS/2 model 50 and higher and their ISA-incompatible <b>Micro</b> <b>Channel</b> Architecture <b>bus.</b> The MCV SoundBlaster has some issues {{outputting}} audio while running on PS/2s with CPUs running faster than 16 MHz. However, the joystick interface is still inoperable on PS/2s {{it was designed}} for due to the slow-speed Schottky chips that have been installed. None of these timing issues affect the Yamaha YM3812. Some of the MCV SoundBlasters were released with faster Schottkys which eradicated some of the problems.|$|R
50|$|In 1987, IBM {{introduced}} the PS/2 computer line. Although the open {{architecture of the}} PC and its successors had been a great success for them, {{and they were the}} biggest single manufacturer, most of the market was buying faster and cheaper IBM-compatible machines made by other firms. The PS/2s remained software compatible, but the hardware was quite different. It {{introduced the}} technically superior <b>Micro</b> <b>Channel</b> architecture <b>bus</b> for higher speed communication within the system, but failed to maintain the open AT bus (later called the ISA bus), which meant that none of the millions of existing add-in cards would function. In other words, the new IBM machines were not IBM-compatible.|$|R
50|$|The higher-numbered {{models were}} {{equipped}} with the <b>Micro</b> <b>Channel</b> <b>bus</b> and mostly ESDI or SCSI hard drives (models 60-041 and 80-041 had MFM hard drives). PS/2 Models 50 (IBM 8550) and 60 (IBM 8560) used the Intel 286 processor, the PS/2 Models 70 (IBM 8570) and 80 used the 386DX, while the mid-range PS/2 Model 55SX (IBM 8555-081) used the 16/32-bit 386SX processor. Later Model 70 and 80 variants (B-xx) also used 25 MHz Intel 486 processors, in a complex called the Power Platform.|$|E
5000|$|The Network Servers {{were sold}} {{exclusively}} with AIX, in a version called [...] "AIX for Apple Network Servers" [...] with some Apple-specific features, like AppleShare services, added; two revisions, 4.1.4 and 4.1.5, exist. Apple's own Unix variant A/UX {{had already been}} discontinued and {{does not support the}} PowerPC. Due to their AIX OS and hardware similarities, the Network Servers are mostly binary compatible with the RS/6000 series. However, applications which rely on early RS/6000's POWER2 processor and <b>Micro</b> <b>Channel</b> <b>bus</b> are incompatible with the ANS's PowerPC CPU and PCI bus.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generations of}} RS/6000 systems used the <b>Micro</b> <b>Channel</b> <b>bus</b> {{technology}} but later models used PCI. Some later models used the standardized PReP and CHRP platforms, co-developed with Apple and Motorola, with Open Firmware. The {{plan was to}} enable {{the use of a}} multitude of operating systems such as Windows NT, NetWare, OS/2, Solaris, Taligent, AIX and Mac OS but in the end only IBM's UNIX variant AIX was used and supported on RS/6000. Linux is widely used on CHRP based RS/6000s, but support was added after the RS/6000 name was changed to eServer pSeries in 2000.|$|E
50|$|Serial ATA (SATA, {{abbreviated}} from Serial AT Attachment) is {{a computer}} bus interface that connects host bus adapters to mass storage devices such as hard disk drives, optical drives, and solid-state drives. Serial ATA succeeded the older Parallel ATA (PATA) standard, offering several advantages over the older interface: reduced cable size and cost (seven conductors instead of 40 or 80), native hot swapping, faster data transfer through higher signaling rates, and more efficient transfer through an (optional) I/O queuing protocol. Although, a number of hot plug PATA offering were first invented and marketed by Core International {{beginning in the late}} 1980s for the <b>Micro</b> <b>Channel</b> architecture <b>bus</b> controllers.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "Hot Plug" [...] was a {{registered}} trademark {{issued by the}} USPTO and other countries in 1992 under [...] "Computer & Software Products & Electrical & Scientific Products Trademarks". [...] It was invented for computer components including PATA in the late 1980s by Hal Prewitt, founder of Core International. First patent details were disclosed in 1987 in USA [...] and Europe [...] related to development of the technology to connect host bus adapters to mass storage device however the filings were not completed. Core created and in 1990 marketed the world's first disk controller, host adapter, disk drives, disk arrays and power supplies that were hot pluggable or swappable.

50|$|The {{basic data}} {{rate of the}} Micro Channel was {{increased}} from ISA's 8 MHz to 10 MHz. This {{may have been a}} modest increase in terms of clock rate, but the greater bus width, coupled with a dedicated bus controller that utilized burst mode transfers, meant that effective throughput was up to five times higher than ISA. For faster transfers the address bus could be reused for data, further increasing the effective width of the bus. Around 40 MB/s of throughput was observed (the theoretical maximum for MCA was 66 MB/s), although some higher throughput functions of the <b>Micro</b> <b>Channel</b> <b>bus</b> were not initially supported on cards operating on an Intel platform.|$|E

40|$|Metallic <b>micro</b> <b>channels</b> {{have the}} {{advantage}} of high thermal conductivity to strength ratio. The recent advances in the manufacturing processes, has increased the feasibility of realizing metallic <b>micro</b> <b>channels</b> with close dimensional control. Presently, various types of micro manufacturing processes are available for the realization of the metallic <b>micro</b> <b>channels.</b> However it is not practical to manufacture any dimensional feature with sharp corner. Depending on the choice of the manufacturing process, the corners get rounded to varying degree. When compared with the dimensions of <b>micro</b> <b>channels</b> the magnitude of the corner radius is considerable.

The thermal & fluid flow performance of the <b>micro</b> <b>channel</b> was simulated by varying the corner radius from 50 microns to 200 microns.

40|$|A new fractal cooling structure, Y-fractal-link <b>micro</b> <b>channel</b> networks, is {{proposed}} to improve the flow and heat transfer characteristics of the <b>micro</b> <b>channel</b> flow path in heat sink. A three-dimensional finite-volume method is employed to simultaneously solve the governing equations for continuity, momentum and energy conservation, and the non-conformal mesh technique is applied. In the numerical computations, a constant heat flux {{is used as a}} boundary condition of the top wall of chip and the flow is assumed to be laminar and fully developed. Compared with the straight parallel and traditional fractal-link <b>micro</b> <b>channel</b> networks, the detailed temperature and pressure distributions of the Y-fractal-link <b>micro</b> <b>channel</b> networks are presented. Furthermore, the optimization of this new structure is discussed with some important parameters, such as the number of branching levels, the bifurcation angle and the number of branches at each level. Numerical results reveal that the Y-fractal-link <b>micro</b> <b>channel</b> networks could significantly improve the integrated performance of heat sink. The pressure drop through the <b>micro</b> <b>channel</b> of this new structure decreases obviously when compared with that of conventional channels.
