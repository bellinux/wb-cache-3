These processes are often held responsible for deindustrialization in advanced industrial societies, increases in income inequality, and pressures on welfare states to transform worker protection and benefits. I demonstrate that the changes in the world economy are much smaller, <b>more</b> gradual, and <b>unevenly</b> spread across societies than the globalization thesis suggests.

40|$|We test {{a unified}} {{observation}} model for estimating surface-loading-induced geocenter motion using GPS. In principle, {{this model is}} more complete than current methods, since both the translation and deformation of the network are modeled in a frame {{at the center of}} mass of the entire Earth system. Real and synthetic data for six different GPS analyses over the period 1997. 25 – 2004. 25 are used to (1) build a comprehensive appraisal of the errors and (2) compare this unified approach with the alternatives. The network shift approach is found to perform particularly poorly with GPS. Furthermore, erroneously estimating additional scale changes with this approach can suggest an apparently significant seasonal variation which is due to real loading. An alternative to the network shift approach involves modeling degree- 1 and possibly higher-degree deformations of the solid Earth in a realization of the center of figure frame. This approach is shown to be <b>more</b> robust for <b>unevenly</b> distributed networks. We find that a unified approach gives the lowest formal error of geocenter motion, smaller differences from the true value when using synthetic data, the best agreement between five different GPS analyses, and the closest (submillimeter) agreement with the geocenter motion predicted from loading models and estimated using satellite laser ranging. For five different GPS analyses, best estimates of annual geocenter motion have a weighted root-mean-square agreement of 0. 6, 0. 6, and 0. 8 mm in amplitude and 21 °, 22 °, and 22 ° in phase for x, y, and z, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} addressed parallel {{hypotheses about}} what maintains tree species diversity in upland, moist-temperate forests: (1) resources are distributed in mesic, upland, temperate forests {{such that the}} environment is fine grained for adult trees and coarse grained for seedlings and (2) co-occurring tree species differ in abilities to exploit resources as seedlings, resulting in changes in seedling performance rank by species with small-scale resource variation. Spatial variation in growth rate ranking among species, through competition, may translate into patterns of relative species abundances of tree seedlings that could persist in the community composition of adult trees. Thus, the maintenance of adult tree species diversity may depend on processes occurring at the seeedling stage. Spatial autocorrelation analysis indicates that resources limiting to plant growth in this ecosystem [...] light, available nitrogen, and soil moisture [...] are far <b>more</b> patchily and <b>unevenly</b> distributed among growing sites that are the size of small plants, including tree seedlings, than among areas covered by large, adult trees. Greenhouse and forest growth experiments showed that 11 tree species which co-occur as adults in uniform habitat differ in their abilities to exploit resources as seedlings. When ranked by seedling growth characteristics associated with competitive ability, the hierarchy among 9 of the species changed with amounts of resource variation typically found among tree-seedling sized patches {{on the forest floor}} and over time. Seedlings of American chestnut, Castanea dentata (Marsh.)

40|$|The {{core of the}} VP- 1 and VP- 2 {{proteins}} {{forming the}} T= 1 icosahedral capsid of the prototype strain of the parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVMp) share amino acids sequence and a common three-dimensional structure; however, the roles of these polypeptides in the virus infection cycle differ. To gain insights into this paradox, the nature, distribution, and biological significance of MVMp particle phosphorylation was investigated. The VP- 1 and VP- 2 proteins isolated from purified empty capsids and from virions containing DNA harbored phosphoserine and phosphothreonine amino acids, which in two-dimensional tryptic analysis resulted in complex patterns reproducibly composed by <b>more</b> than 15 <b>unevenly</b> phosphorylated peptides. Whereas secondary protease digestions and comigration of most weak peptides in the fingerprints revealed common phosphorylation sites in the VP- 1 and VP- 2 subunits assembled in capsids, the major tryptic phosphopeptides were remarkably characteristic of either polypeptide. The VP- 2 -specific peptide named B, containing {{the bulk of the}} 32 P label of the MVMp particle in the form of phosphoserine, was mapped to the structurally unordered N-terminal domain of this polypeptide. Mutations in any or all four serine residues present in peptide B showed that the VP- 2 N-terminal domain is phosphorylated at multiple sites, even though none of them was essential for capsid assembly or virus formation. Chromatographic analysis of purified wild-type (wt) and mutant peptide B digested with a panel of specific proteases allowed us to identify the VP- 2 residues Ser- 2, Ser- 6, and Ser- 10 as the main phosphate acceptors for MVMp capsid during the natural viral infection. Phosphorylation at VP- 2 N-terminal serines was not necessary for the externalization of this domain outside of the capsid shell in particles containing DNA. However, the plaque-forming capacity and plaque size of VP- 2 N-terminal phosphorylation mutants were severely reduced, with the evolutionarily conserved Ser- 2 determining most of the phenotypic effect. In addition, the phosphorylated amino acids were not required for infection initiation or for nuclear translocation of the expressed structural proteins, and thus a role at a late stage of MVMp life cycle is proposed. This study illustrates the complexity of posttranslational modification of icosahedral viral capsids and underscores phosphorylation as a versatile mechanism to modulate the biological functions of their protein subunits...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} study of British policy towards Poland from 194 to 1947. It traces the British attempt to {{negotiate}} a postwar political settlement for Poland that would met he expectations of both the Polish government-in-exile, to which Britain had committed its support in return for Poland’s substantial wartime military contribution, and the Soviet Union. During {{the last year and}} a half of the war, British policy makers struggled to mediate between the two sides and accommodate their competing demands. Ultimately, a compromise was reached, which saw the former prime minister of the exile government, Stanisław Mikołajczyk, return to Poland at he end of the war to join the provisional government. Mikołajczyk agreed to return on the basis of a British commitment to provide ongoing support in reconstituting a sovereign Polish state and establishing a democratic government. This thesis charts the outcome of that commitment, from the negotiations for the formation of the new Polish government under the auspices of the Three Power Commission in the summer of 1945, to the Polish referendum of June 1946, and the elections in January 1947. It shows that British policy makers struggled to met the commitment to Poland within the changing context of the postwar international system. In the circumstances of the emerging Cold War, as the reality of the Soviet resolve to absorb Poland into its sphere grew clearer, Britain’s political promises to the Polish democratic opposition became increasingly difficult to fulfil. Not al sections of the British policy making establishment were immediately prepared to accept heir dramatically circumscribed power to influence the shape of the Polish political settlement. Whereas the foreign secretary, Ernest Bevin reconciled himself to the new circumstances with pragmatic sped, the Warsaw embassy, and many of the Foreign Office Northern Department officials, were less wiling to abandon the original terms of the British commitment. Thus, while some diplomatic and Foreign Office officials continued to lend support to the democratic Polish opposition parties, Bevin increasingly sought to limit Anglo-Polish relations to bilateral issues, including negotiations for financial and trade agreements, the repatriation of former members of the Polish armed forces, the final demarcation of Poland’s western frontier, and the transfer of the German population from western Poland to the British occupation zone. The result of these different priorities was a lack of uniformity in British policy. Much of the scholarship on Britain’s early postwar policy towards Poland takes one of two approaches: either it assumes that Britain understood immediately in 1945 that Poland was ‘lost’ to the Soviet Union, or it sets a reprehensible cynicism in the British approach, without due acknowledgement of the limits which constrained British policy options. This thesis offers a different interpretation; it argues that Britain adjusted much <b>more</b> slowly and <b>unevenly</b> to its diminished position after the war, and that its limited capacity to shape the Polish political settlement was understood only gradually, and at different times in different parts of the policy making establishment, creating an overall inconsistency in policy...|$|R

Consequently, {{it has been}} suggested that primates consuming stress-limited food on a regular basis would have thick-enameled molars in comparison to primates consuming soft food. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of enamel over a single tooth crown is not homogeneous, and thick enamel is expected to be <b>more</b> <b>unevenly</b> distributed in durophagous primates. Still, a proper methodology to quantitatively characterize enamel 3 D distribution and test this hypothesis is yet to be developed. Unworn to slightly worn upper second molars belonging to 32 species of anthropoid primates and corresponding to a wide range of diets were digitized using high resolution microcomputed tomography. In addition, their durophagous ability was scored from existing literature. 3 D average and relative enamel thickness were computed based on the volumetric reconstruction of the enamel cap. Geometric estimates of their average and relative enamel-dentine distance were also computed using 3 D dental topography. Both methods gave different estimations of average and relative enamel thickness. This study also introduces pachymetric profiles, a method inspired from traditional topography to graphically characterize thick enamel distribution. Pachymetric profiles and topographic maps of enamel-dentine distance are combined to assess the evenness of thick enamel distribution. Both pachymetric profiles and topographic maps indicate that thick enamel is not significantly <b>more</b> <b>unevenly</b> distributed in durophagous species, except in Cercopithecidae. In this family, durophagous species such as mangabeys are characterized by an uneven thick enamel and high pachymetric profile slopes at the average enamel thickness, whereas non-durophagous species such as colobine monkeys are not. These results indicate that the distribution of thick enamel follows different patterns across anthropoids.

40|$|The matched-guise test, {{which was}} {{originally}} developed by Lambert et al.  (1960), has been useful in determining covert attitudes towards accents, dialects, or languages. In this paper, the author presents a fresh take on matched-guise tests in sociolinguistics utilizing modern technology to digitally manipulate a female voice into a male voice. This {{makes it possible}} to create recordings in which the tone, intonation, stress, and personality traits are the same, yet the apparent guise is different, thus allowing us to ascertain attitudes towards the sexes as well. Using this method on 169   respondents of mixed sex, the author has shown that there are statistical differences between how the male and female guises are interpreted. When all collaborative and competitive aspects are combined, the female guise is considered more collaborative, while the male is considered more competitive. Contradictory to old stereotypes it would also seem as though men are considered less knowledgeable than women. Less sexist people also rate the male and the female guise <b>more</b> <b>unevenly</b> than more sexist people do. A less sexist person favours the female guise on collaborative variables, while a more sexist person favours neither guise...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{investigated}} throughput maximization via optimal UAV positioning. A {{heuristic method}} and an approximation algorithm were proposed {{to determine the}} UAV position based on user positions and their data rate demands. The heuristic method is computationally simple and has extremely low running time but does not guarantee {{the determination of the}} optimal UAV position. The approximation algorithm’s running time is relatively high as compared to the heuristic method but can determine a UAV position arbitrarily close to the optimal position. The computational complexity of the approximation algorithm is linearly dependent on the number of grid points and quadratically dependent on the number of users. For practical problems, the approximation algorithm can compute the desired UAV position in real time and can, therefore, be used on a UAV platform. Simulation results indicate that by moving the UAV to the position determined by the proposed schemes, higher improvement in throughput can be achieved when user positions are <b>more</b> <b>unevenly</b> distributed and vice versa. Similarly, when user data rate demands are more widely spread, higher improvement in throughput can be achieved by moving the UAV to the position determined by the proposed schemes. The approximation algorithm produces more improvement in throughput than the heuristic method.|$|E
40|$|Many {{bird species}} lay eggs {{speckled}} with protoporphyrin-based spots, however, {{for most of}} them the function of eggshell spotting is unknown. A plausible hypothesis is that protoporphyrin might have a structural function in strengthening the eggshell and is therefore deposited when calcium is scarce. In this study, we experimentally provided Great Tit Parus major females with supplemental calcium to examine its effect on the protoporphyrin-based maculation of their eggs. In addition, we studied variation in eggshell pigmentation patterns in relation to other egg parameters and laying order. Calcium-supplemented females laid larger eggs but shell thickness was not significantly affected by the treatment. Calcium supplementation may reduce the time and energy females devote to searching for calcium-rich material, so that they can collect more nutrients and so lay larger eggs. Furthermore, pigment darkness was associated with egg volume and shape, which suggests that female quality and environmental food availability may also influence the shell pigmentation pattern. Within clutches, later-laid eggs had larger and darker spots that were distributed <b>more</b> <b>unevenly</b> on the shell surface. This within-clutch pattern could be explained by the increase in egg volume and egg shape and a decline in shell thickness with egg-laying order, which characteristics were all related to shell-spotting pattern. Eggs with a coronal ring had thinner shells, but pigment intensity and spot size were not related to shell thickness. Thus, our results suggest that concentrated spotting distribution may have a mechanical function, supporting the structural-function hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{computerized}} method for the identification and description of colour areas in melanocytic lesion images based on an approach mimicking the human perception of colours. A colour palette comprising six colour groups (black, dark brown, light brown, blue-grey, red and white) was created by selecting single colour components within melanocytic lesion images acquired using a digital videomicroscope, and was implemented in the image analysis program. For each colour region, the area, the distance from the lesion centroid, the spread, the colour area distribution in the internal and the external part of the lesion, and asymmetries were assessed on 604 melanocytic lesion images in our image database. Black, white and blue-grey colour areas were detected more frequently in melanomas compared with naevi. Moreover, significant differences in colour descriptors were observed for each colour group, showing that colour areas are <b>more</b> <b>unevenly</b> distributed in melanomas compared with naevi. Using a discriminant analysis approach, the extension of dark, white and blue-grey areas and some descriptors of the distribution of the colour areas were identified as the most relevant colour parameters for differentiating between benign and malignant lesions. In conclusion, our automatic procedure breaks down the image into the colour areas used in the clinical examination process, and also supplies a description of their extension and distribution, with parameters that correlate with the clinical concepts of regularity and homogeneity...|$|E
40|$|Anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) {{bacteria}}, aerobic ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) {{are three}} groups of ammonium/ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes (AOPs) {{that are involved in}} the nitrogen cycle. This research compared the AOP communities in a constructed freshwater wetland with a natural coastal marine wetland in the subtropical Hong Kong. Both vegetated/rhizosphere and nonvegetated sediments were investigated to identify the effects of different macrophytes on the AOP communities. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -amplified gene fragments of 16 S rRNA and archaeal and bacterial amoA (encoding the ammonia monooxygenase alpha subunit) were applied as molecular biomarkers to analyze the AOPs' phylogeny and diversity. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the abundances of AOPs in the sediments. The results showed that the relatively more heterogeneous freshwater wetland contained a broader range of phylotypes, higher diversity, more complex community structures, and <b>more</b> <b>unevenly</b> distributed abundances of AOPs than the coastal wetland. The effects of vegetation on the community structures of AOPs were plant-specific. The exotic Typha angustifolia affected the community structures of all AOPs and enhanced their abundances in the rhizosphere region. Both Phragmites australis and Cyperus malaccensis showed some effects on the community structures of AOB, but minimal effects on those of anammox bacteria or AOA. Kandelia obovata had almost no detectable effect on all AOPs due to their smaller size. This study suggested that the freshwater and coastal marine wetlands may have different contributions to the inorganic N removal due to the variations in AOP communities and plant types. © 2012 The Author(s). link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
