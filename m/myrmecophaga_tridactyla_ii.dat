40|$|Background: Anaplasma marginale is a {{well-known}} cattle pathogen of tropical and subtropical world regions. Even though, this obligate intracellular bacterium {{has been reported in}} other host species different than bovine, it has never been documented in <b>Myrmecophaga</b> <b>tridactyla</b> (giant anteater) or Hippocamelus antisense (taruca), which are two native endangered species. Methods: Samples from two sick wild animals: a <b>Myrmecophaga</b> <b>tridactyla</b> (blood) and a Hippocamelus antisense (blood and serum) were studied for the presence of A. marginale DNA through msp 5 gene fragment amplification. Further characterization was done through MSP 1 a tandem repeats analysis and MLST scheme and the genetic relationship among previously characterized A. marginale sequences were studied by applying, eBURST algorithm and AMOVA analysis. Results: Anaplasma marginale DNA was identified in the <b>Myrmecophaga</b> <b>tridactyla</b> and Hippocamelus antisense samples. Through molecular markers, we identified an identical genotype in both animals that was not previously reported in bovine host. The analysis through eBURST and AMOVA revealed no differentiation between the taruca/anteater isolate and the bovine group. Conclusions: In the present publication we report the identification of A. marginale DNA in a novel ruminant (Hippocamelus antisense) and non-ruminant (<b>Myrmecophaga</b> <b>tridactyla)</b> host species. Genotyping analysis of isolates demonstrated the close relatedness of the new isolate with the circulation population of A. marginale in livestock. Further analysis is needed to understand whether these two hosts contribute to the anaplasmosis epidemiology...|$|R

40|$|The giant {{anteater}} (<b>Myrmecophaga</b> <b>tridactyla),</b> a mammal {{belonging to the}} order Xenarthra and family Myrmecophagidae, is an endangered species. For this reason, additional knowledge about its anatomy is of interest, especially the forelimb, which plays important roles in feeding and defense. The goal {{of this study was}} to learn more about the origin and distribution of the axillary nerve of <b>Myrmecophaga</b> <b>tridactyla</b> by studying two individuals (one male and one female) that belong to the Research Laboratory of Wild Animals (UFU). The study material consisted of corpses fixed and preserved in 10 % aqueous formalin solution. Dissection of the material followed standard procedures. In both animals, the axillary nerve was found in the ventral branch of the sixth cervical (C 6) and seventh (C 7) spinal nerve. This nerve showed symmetry in relation to its position in the two specimens and branched into the teres major, teres minor and deltoid muscles.
