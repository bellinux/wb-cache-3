5|$|NHL {{broadcaster}} Darren Eliot {{attributes the}} {{apparent lack of}} playoff success to the different style of competition compared to the regular season: instead of playing different teams every night, {{the goal is to}} advance through four best-of-seven playoff series. The Presidents' Trophy winner may have to go through other playoff clubs who might have a hotter goaltender, a better defensive team or other players that pose match-up problems. If the regular-season champion's primary success was merely outscoring others, they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> luck facing goaltenders that can shut them out. The lack of playoff experience may have been to blame in the examples of the 1999–2000 St. Louis Blues and 2008–09 San Jose Sharks, as neither team had advanced past the second round for five or more seasons. Teams have often given up pursuit of finishing first in the League in order to avoid injuries and rest key players for the postseason.|$|E

In Partners, a player would bid a trick for every Ace, King, and Queen {{in a side}} suit (i.e.: non-Spade). In Cutthroat, a player would rarely bid on a King in a long side suit (5+ cards) nor a Queen in any length side suit {{because of the risk}} of their being trumped. This risk is reduced in Partners by the possibility that partner <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the long suit and able to discard or to overtrump an opponent.|$|E

Some birds, notably crows, parrots and birds of prey, [...] "play" [...] with objects, many of them playing in flight with such items as stones, sticks and leaves, by letting them go and catching them again before they reach the ground. A few species repeatedly drop stones, apparently for the enjoyment of the sound effects. Many other species of animals, both avian and non-avian, play with objects in a similar manner.|$|E

2500|$|Suddenly, on May 31, 1557, Morone {{was arrested}} by the Pope's nephew and Secretary of State personally. Pietro Carnesecchi, a former {{adherent}} of Morone, wrote: [...] "Why Morone is imprisoned, no one knows; many say that the Cardinals have brought it about, in order that he <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their way at the next election of a Pope, when he would get {{the greatest number of}} votes. The Pope intends summoning all the Cardinals to Rome, that they as a college may judge Morone." [...] There was an immediate outcry. The cardinals wanted a Congregation be held at which explanations would be demanded. Paul IV took the initiative and held a Congregation at which he presided, telling the cardinals that it was not politics but the honor of God that was involved. The process against Morone would be carried out by the members of the Inquisition. Twenty-one charges were levelled at him. On June 12, 1557, Morone was interrogated in the Castel S. Angelo by the committee: [...] Cardinals Innocenzo del Monte, Jean Suau, Scipione Rebiba, Spoletano , and Michele Ghislieri. Having examined him and heard his extensive rejoinders, the committee reported in favor of Morone but Paul IV was not satisfied. Morone remained in the Castel S. Angelo until the death of Paul IV, when the College of Cardinals ordered his release. [...] Cardinal Rebiba was sent as Nuncio to France, to discuss the matter of an alliance with Henri II.|$|E
