40|$|Indian Railways {{was being}} roundly criticized for {{creating}} an environment hazard by <b>discharging</b> <b>toilet</b> waste on tracks. IR coaches have toilet {{system that has}} hole on the floor through which human feces and urine is flushed directly on railway tracks. Various types of environment friendly Green toilets have put on outfields trials by Indian Railways to overcome this problem. Controlled <b>Discharge</b> <b>Toilet</b> System (CDTS), Bio-toilet developed by Indian Railways engineers and DRDO biotechnologists, development of Zero <b>Discharge</b> <b>Toilet</b> System (ZDTS) by IIT Kanpur and Research Development and Standards Organization (RDSO) Lucknow, are some efforts in this direction. These technologies are more expensive due to inherent complexities, disposal problem at yards (ZDTS) and requirement of extra infrastructure at the terminal. FFEM approach not only solves these problems but also convert toilet waste into energy which can be utilized further in lighting at platforms or some other useful purposes...|$|R

40|$|Greywater {{consists}} of household wastewater excluding <b>toilet</b> <b>discharges.</b> Three systems were compared for the biological treatment of greywater {{at a similar}} hydraulic retention time of approximately 12 – 13 hours. These systems were aerobic treatment in a sequencing batch reactor, anaerobic treatment in an up-flow anaerobic blanket reactor and combined anaerobic-aerobic treatment (up-flow anaerobic blanket reactor + sequencing batch reactor). Aerobic conditions resulted in a COD removal of 90 %, which {{was significantly higher than}} 51 % removal by anaerobic treatment. The low removal in the anaerobic reactor may have been caused by high concentration of anionic surfactants in the influent (43. 5 mg/L) and a poor removal of the colloidal fraction of the COD in up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors. Combined aerobic-anaerobic treatment accomplished a COD removal of 89 %, similar to the aerobic treatment alone. Greywater methanization was 32 % for the anaerobic system and 25 % for the anaerobic-aerobic system, yielding a small amount of energy. Therefore, anaerobic pre-treatment is not feasible and an aerobic system is preferred for the treatment of greywate...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{drinking}} water in activities that require no potable water {{is a waste of}} resources that could be avoided by using clean water, as the rainfall water. This procedure saves the amount spend on <b>toilet</b> <b>discharges</b> in washing cars, sidewalks, clothes and general irrigation {{as well as on the}} reduction of floods, helping to minimize environmental impacts on urban areas. This work aims to design, develop and test a sand filter to retain solid waste material from the rain water, allowing the improvement of their quality. The experimental work was developed in the laboratory of Environmental Engineering at the “Centro Universitário Franciscano”, using sand as a filter for a water reservoir of 250 liters, with filter materials such as gravel, sand, and geotextil and a electrical water-pump to test the system of reverse flow. By the results obtained the maximum flow filtration rate estimated is 11, 800 L h- 1. The filter controls 100 % of particles larger than 0. 15 mm. Filtered water in 75 % of particles not removed by the filter has diameter less than 0. 075 mm. The filter also provides efficiency of 79. 12 % in the removal of turbidity, 77. 04 % of color, electrical conductivity and 55. 86 % in 85. 96 % of total solids...|$|R

30|$|For our patient, {{we decided}} on a laparoscopic approach. Identifying the anatomy of the infarcted spleen’s pedicle based on the {{preoperative}} CT was difficult because the {{blood flow to the}} organ was interrupted. Intraoperatively, dissection of the pedicle was easier than during a normal splenectomy because the pedicle was not fixed and exfoliation was unnecessary. As a result, a successful laparoscopic splenectomy was completed, without needing to convert to an open laparotomy. The patient was <b>discharged</b> <b>4</b> [*]days after surgery, without any complications.

40|$|Indian Railways (IR) {{is a large}} {{transport}} organization running 8700 trains, reaching 7000 {{stations and}} handling about 1. 6 crore passengers per day. IR runs several long distant trains, some of which involve journeys upto three nights. The number of non suburban passengers traveling on IR is about 0. 6 crore per day. There are three sources of fecal matter generation in IR (i) Toilets in trains, (ii) Railway stations; and (iii) Use of railway tracks for open defecation. The existing toilet system in the coaches discharges excreta directly {{to the ground and}} the railway tracks. The consequences include unacceptable hygienic conditions, particularly in the railway stations, and damage to rails. IR is making efforts to introduce environment friendly <b>toilet</b> <b>discharge</b> system, for which three options are being considered; modular, vacuum and chemical. Toilets at stations are a part of amenities being provided, linked to the category of the station. There is an attempt to modernize toilets at important stations. A related socio economic problem is that of people residing near the railway stations, without access to toilet facilities, using tracks for open defecation. The issue of dealing with fecal matter should be viewed in the larger context of waste management. With effective waste management, fecal matter can be recycled and used as liquid fertilizers and quality organic manures. This paper attempts to understand the issues related to fecal matter management on the IR, and provide a framework for solutions. ...|$|R
