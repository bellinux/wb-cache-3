5|$|Though the White House {{maintained}} public neutrality, privately Kennedy <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> desired a Liberal victory. Kennedy lent Lou Harris, his pollster to {{work for}} the Liberals again. On election day, April 8, 1963, the Liberals claimed 129 seats to the Tories' 95, five seats short of an absolute majority. Diefenbaker held to power for several days, until six Quebec Social Credit MPs signed a statement that Pearson should form the government. These votes would be enough to give Pearson support of a majority of the House of Commons, and Diefenbaker resigned. The six MPs repudiated the statement within days. Nonetheless, Pearson formed a government {{with the support of the}} NDP.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{wanted to}} get rid of Goodell, a Republican who had been {{appointed}} by Governor Rockefeller after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, and who had shifted considerably to the left while in office. Goodell could be sacrificed as there was a Conservative Party candidate, James Buckley, who might win the seat. Nixon did not want to be seen as engineering the defeat of a fellow Republican, and did not have Agnew go to New York until after Nixon left on a European trip, hoping Agnew would be perceived as acting on his own. After dueling long-distance with Goodell over the report of the Scranton Commission on campus violence (Agnew considered it too permissive), Agnew gave a speech in New York in which, without naming names, he <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> supported Buckley. That Nixon was behind the machinations did not remain secret long, as both Agnew and Nixon adviser Murray Chotiner disclosed it; Goodell stated he still believed he had Nixon's support. Although it was by then deemed unlikely the Republicans could gain control of the Senate, both Nixon and Agnew went on the campaign trail for the final days before the election. The outcome was disappointing: Republicans gained only two seats in the Senate, and lost eleven governorships. For Agnew, one bright spot was Goodell's defeat by Buckley in New York, but he was disappointed when his former chief of staff, Charles Blair, failed to unseat Governor Marvin Mandel, Agnew's successor and a Democrat, in Maryland.|$|E

25|$|Before the 2011–12 NBA season, the Hornets were {{considering}} trade offers for Chris Paul. Paul eventually requested a trade to the New York Knicks. The Hornets looked at many teams, including the Boston Celtics and the Golden State Warriors as trade partners, but Paul had <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> {{wanted to be}} traded to New York or Los Angeles. A three-team trade involving the Los Angeles Lakers and the Houston Rockets was agreed upon, but commissioner David Stern vetoed the trade. On December 14, 2011, the Hornets agreed to {{a deal with the}} Los Angeles Clippers that would send Paul to L.A. in exchange for Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu, and a first-round draft pick acquired by the Clippers from a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2004.|$|E

25|$|First {{they made}} a major four player swap with the Wichita Wings. The deal in {{principle}} was to see Drillers captain Bill Sedgewick and 'keeper Pat Onstad head to the Wings, in exchange for defender LeBaron Hollimon, and midfielder Sterling Westcott. In actuality, there was a fair bit of underhanded dealing on both sides, as the Drillers knew that Onstad {{had no intention of}} returning to play indoor, and Wichita knew Westcott had no intention of reporting as he had agreed to a deal with a WISL club. Beyond that, Sedgewick <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> didn't want to play for anyone but Edmonton, and then decided to also sign with a WISL club in Utah, where he also had business interests. So, {{at the end of the}} ordeal the only player that ended up reporting was LeBaron Hollimon.|$|E
25|$|In the prequel comic to {{the game}} , Aquaman appears to attack Japanese {{fisherman}} who killed a whale. He is intercepted by the Justice League, with it turning into a brawl between the Justice League and the Atlanteans. Superman, having undergone {{the death of his}} wife and unborn child and the destruction of Metropolis, threatens Aquaman to stop his efforts. While warned over a communication link with Batman not to test him, Aquaman does by summoning a kraken. In response Superman, Green Lantern, Shazam, and Wonder Woman lift the entire city of Atlantis off the sea floor and carry it to dry deserts, putting its inhabitants in harm to bully Aquaman. He relents {{and as a result of}} this largely abstains from the conflict between the Regime (led by Superman) and the Insurgency (led by Batman). In Year Four, he gets involved when Batman informs him that the Greek gods have attempted to force their own rule over the world, so Aquaman and Mera take on Poseidon. He wins the conflict as his wife stalls a massive tidal wave from crashing on Themiscyra. Superman comes to Atlantis in Year Five to ensure the Regime has Aquaman's support, despite Aquaman having frequently <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> is not choosing sides. He agrees purely to get him to leave.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 the {{government}} {{set up a}} Land Planning Committee, whose first report recommended that government should re-acquire land which was either undeveloped or occupied by large numbers of Africans. This included the projected re-purchase of {{about two-thirds of the}} British Central Africa Company’s freehold land. The company had long fought to retain its landholdings, much of which was undeveloped, claiming that soil exhaustion and erosion, deforestation and poor husbandry would result if the land were resettled by smallholders. In 1948, the company was still unwilling to sell its better land to {{the government}}. However, it was prepared to sell inferior land, and in 1948 the government bought freehold land from the British Central Africa Company in the Chingale area {{in the western part of}} Zomba District to convert it to land held by customary tenure and resettle Africans evacuated from other estates in the Shire valley and highlands on it. The Chingale resettlement scheme took place from 1948 to 1954. Following a serious famine in 1949, Geoffrey Colby, the Governor of Nyasaland from 1948 to 1956, attempted to get the major estate companies to sell the under-used parts of their land to the government for resettlement. However, Colby <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> would not use the compulsory purchase powers he had been granted, preferring voluntary agreement. By ruling compulsion out, he gave unintended encouragement to the British Central Africa Company’s plans to retain its estates. In 1955, the Nyasaland government agreed to purchase almost 36,470 acres in Cholo District with 24,600 residents from the British Central Africa Company for resettlement. Before this, the company had owned 74,262 acres with 36,400 residents. The company retained 38,143 acres, but of the 11,800 residents, 3,240 were moved onto Crown lands. However, it was only in 1962, when independence was clearly in prospect, that the company accepted the need to sell its surplus land, retaining only its most profitable assets. At the time of its takeover by Lonrho (Malawi) Ltd in 1964, the Central Africa Company Ltd owned a 3,500 acre tea plantation, two tea factories and some other small estates. The Central Africa Company Ltd, with its remaining agricultural assets, was sold by Lonrho to African Plantations Corporation June 1997.|$|E

Prominent Liberal frontbencher Paul Martin called Diefenbaker's response [...] "one of the greatest devastating speeches" [...] and [...] "Diefenbaker's great hour". On February 1, Diefenbaker asked the Governor General, Vincent Massey, to dissolve Parliament, alleging that though St. Laurent had promised cooperation, Pearson had <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> would not follow his predecessor's lead. Massey agreed to the dissolution, and Diefenbaker set an election date of March 31, 1958.|$|E

[...] Hanna in particular was reluctant to publicly put aside his presidential candidacy, believing that keeping it alive would help assure his re-election by the legislature in 1904. [...] In 1903, Foraker saw an opportunity to embarrass Hanna and boost his own chances for 1908 by getting the Republican state convention to pass a resolution endorsing Roosevelt for re-election. [...] If Hanna supported the resolution, he <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> would not be a candidate; if he opposed it, he risked Roosevelt's wrath. [...] Hanna sent Roosevelt a telegram that he would oppose the resolution; Roosevelt replied that he expected his administration's supporters to vote for such a resolution, and Hanna gave in.|$|E
500|$|In McDonald's draft year of 1973, the National Hockey League (NHL) was in {{competition}} with the rival World Hockey Association (WHA) for talent. McDonald was considered a top junior prospect and was recruited by both leagues. The Vancouver Canucks had the third overall selection in the NHL draft and were interested in drafting him, but opted against it when McDonald <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> would likely go to the WHA rather than play with Vancouver. [...] Instead, {{he went to the}} Toronto Maple Leafs with the fourth overall pick. In the WHA draft, he was selected 10th overall by the Cleveland Crusaders. McDonald chose to play in the NHL, signing a contract with the Maple Leafs that was considered to be among the richest in the league. [...] The deal, worth between $175,000 and $200,000 per season, came {{as a result of the}} competition between the two leagues and McDonald found that some of the older players in Toronto resented him as a result.|$|E
500|$|On June 14, 2007, Howard {{was traded}} to the Minnesota Timberwolves for James and Justin Reed. [...] According to ESPN, he regretted not {{choosing}} Minnesota {{the last time he had}} been a free agent and was looking forward to playing with Garnett. [...] Soon after Howard signed with Minnesota, the team traded Garnett to the Boston Celtics. Howard <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> was not interested in being on a team in Minnesota that was focused on developing young talent and consequently requested a trade once Garnett was no longer a member of the team. [...] Howard still had $6.88million and $7.38million in salary owed to him over the next two seasons, which made him difficult to trade. Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor noted that the team would attempt to accommodate his wishes but acknowledged that doing so would be difficult. On October 29, 2007, the Timberwolves waived Howard after agreeing to a contractual buyout agreement worth $10million spread over four years instead of the roughly $14.25million ($6.88million plus $7.38million) that Minnesota would otherwise have owed him.|$|E

This self-promotion neither surprised nor upset his former comrades. [...] "It is what I would have expected", said Richards. [...] "He was bombastic [...] but true-hearted and a staunch friend". Alexander Stevens, the party's chief scientist, concurred. They knew that Joyce, for all his swaggering style, had the will and determination to [...] "drag men back from certain death". Lord Shackleton, the explorer's son, named Joyce (with Mackintosh and Richards) as [...] "one of those who emerge from the (Ross Sea party) story as heroes".|$|E
500|$|Whitlam {{had offered}} Barnard a {{diplomatic}} post; in early 1975 Barnard agreed to this, triggering a by-election in his Tasmanian electorate of Bass. The election on 28 June proved {{a disaster for}} Labor, which lost the seat with a swing against it of 17percent. The next week, Whitlam fired Barnard's successor as deputy prime minister, Cairns, who had misled Parliament regarding the Loans Affair amid controversy {{about his relationship with}} his office manager, Junie Morosi. At the time of Cairns's dismissal, one Senate seat was vacant, following the death on 30 June of Queensland ALP Senator Bertie Milliner. The state Labor party nominated Mal Colston, resulting in a deadlock. The unicameral Queensland legislature twice voted against Colston, and the party refused to submit any alternative candidates. Bjelke-Petersen finally convinced the legislature to elect a low-level union official, Albert Field, who had contacted his office and expressed a willingness to serve. In interviews, Field <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> would not support Whitlam. Field was expelled from the ALP for standing against Colston, and Labor senators boycotted his swearing-in. Whitlam argued that, because of the manner of filling vacancies, the Senate was [...] "corrupted" [...] and [...] "tainted", with the Opposition enjoying a majority they did not win at the ballot box.|$|E
