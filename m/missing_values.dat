Nonetheless, exiting with an error message is only rarely the right answer.

The restarts offered constitute the mechanisms available for recovering from error; the selection of restart by the condition handler supplies the policy.|$|E

30|$|If the two given {{trees have}} non-leaf root nodes, then the Miss {{algorithm}} finds identical arcs where each arc from one tree and recursively calls Miss algorithm at their respective sub-trees to calculate any <b>missing</b> <b>value</b> present at their descendants. If any arc which {{is present in}} one tree and is absent in other tree, then the <b>missing</b> <b>value</b> is calculated as arc weight multiplied with the simplicity value at its respective sub-tree. Such a pair of trees is shown as case 2 in Fig. 1. If one tree is leaf and other tree is non-leaf, then Miss algorithm computes simplicity value at non-leaf node, which are shown as case 3 and case 4 in Fig. 1. Miss algorithm sums all such <b>missing</b> <b>value</b> and the counter is updated. Finally, the algorithm returns the average <b>missing</b> <b>value</b> (see Algorithm 4).|$|R

50|$|However, {{using these}} types of models to predict <b>missing</b> <b>values</b> or {{outliers}} {{in a long time}} series is difficult and often unreliable, particularly if the number of values to be in-filled is relatively high in comparison with total record length. The accuracy of the estimate depends on how good and representative the model is and how long the period of <b>missing</b> <b>values</b> extends. The in a case of a dynamic process, so any variable is dependent, not just on the historical time series of the same variable but also on several other variables or parameters of the process. In other words, the problem is an exercise in multivariate analysis rather than the univariate approach of most of the traditional methods of estimating <b>missing</b> <b>values</b> and outliers; a multivariate model will therefore be more representative than a univariate one for predicting <b>missing</b> <b>values.</b> The kohonin self organising map (KSOM) offers a simple and robust multivariate model for data analysis, thus providing good possibilities to estimate <b>missing</b> <b>values,</b> taking into account its relationship or correlation with other pertinent variables in the data record.|$|E
