5|$|The <b>Marihuana</b> Tax Act of 1937 {{effectively}} made possession or {{transfer of}} <b>marihuana</b> illegal throughout the United States under federal law, excluding medical and industrial uses, through imposition of an excise tax on all sales of hemp. Annual fees were $24 ($637 adjusted for inflation) for importers, manufacturers, and cultivators of cannabis, $1 ($24 adjusted for inflation) for medical and research purposes, and $3 ($82 adjusted for inflation) for industrial users. Detailed sales logs {{were required to}} record <b>marihuana</b> sales. Selling <b>marihuana</b> to any person who had previously paid the annual fee incurred a tax of $1 per ounce or fraction thereof; however, the tax was $100 ($2,206 adjusted for inflation) per ounce or fraction thereof to sell any person who had not registered and paid the annual fee.|$|E
5|$|After the Philippines fell to Japanese {{forces in}} 1942, the Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Army urged farmers to grow hemp fiber and tax stamps for {{cultivation}} were issued to farmers. Without {{any change in}} the <b>Marihuana</b> Tax Act, over 400,000 acres of hemp were cultivated between 1942 and 1945. The last commercial hemp fields were planted in Wisconsin in 1957. New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, who was a strong opponent of the 1937 <b>Marihuana</b> Tax Act, started the LaGuardia Commission that in 1944 contradicted the earlier reports of addiction, madness, and overt sexuality.|$|E
5|$|The American Medical Association (AMA) {{opposed the}} act because the tax was imposed on {{physicians}} prescribing cannabis, retail pharmacists selling cannabis, and medical cannabis cultivation and manufacturing; instead of enacting the <b>Marihuana</b> Tax Act the AMA proposed cannabis {{be added to}} the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act. This approach was unappealing to some legislators who feared that adding a new substance to the Harrison Act would subject that act to new legal scrutiny. Since the federal government had no authority under the 10th Amendment to regulate medicines, that power being reserved by individual states in 1937, a tax was the only viable way to legislate marijuana.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, the <b>Marihuana</b> Tax Act of 1937 {{was passed}} in the United States, levying a tax on anyone who dealt commercially in cannabis, hemp, or marijuana. The passing of the Act to destroy the US hemp {{industry}} has been disputed to involve businessmen Andrew Mellon, Randolph Hearst and the Du Pont family.|$|E
25|$|In the United States in 1937, the <b>Marihuana</b> Tax Act was passed, and {{prohibited}} {{the production of}} hemp in addition to cannabis. The reasons that hemp was also included in this law are disputed—several scholars have claimed that the act was passed in order to destroy the US hemp industry, with the primary involvement of businessmen Andrew Mellon, Randolph Hearst, and the Du Pont family. But the improvements of the decorticators, machines that separate the fibers from the hemp stem, could not make hemp fiber a very cheap substitute for fibers from other sources because it could not change that basic fact that strong fibers are only found in the bast, the outer part of the stem. Only about 1/3 of the stem are long and strong fibers. The company DuPont and many industrial historians dispute a link between nylon and hemp. They argue {{that the purpose of}} developing the nylon was to produce a fiber {{that could be used in}} thin stockings for females and compete with silk.|$|E
500|$|The legal {{history of}} {{cannabis}} in the United States {{relates to the}} regulation of cannabis [...] (legal term marijuana) use for medical, recreational or industrial purposes in the United States. Increased restrictions and labeling of cannabis as a poison began in many states from 1906 onward, and outright prohibitions began in the 1920s. By the mid-1930s marijuana was regulated as a drug in every state, including 35 states that adopted the Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act. The first national regulation was the <b>Marihuana</b> Tax Act of 1937.|$|E
500|$|... "She Shoulda Said 'No'!" [...] (also {{known as}} Wild Weed; The Devil's Weed; Marijuana, the Devil's Weed; and The Story of Lila Leeds and Her Exposé of the Marijuana Racket) is a 1949 {{exploitation}} film that follows {{in the spirit}} of morality tales such as the 1936 films Reefer Madness and <b>Marihuana.</b> Directed by Sam Newfield (using the pseudonym [...] "Sherman Scott") and starring Lila Leeds, it was originally produced to capitalize on the arrest of Leeds and Robert Mitchum on a charge of marijuana conspiracy.|$|E
500|$|According to Friedman, Babb's {{presentations of}} the film made more money than any other film the same theater would {{showcase}} over a typical film's full booking. While actual dollar figures are not available {{because of the nature}} of the genre (which was known for poor record keeping and unconventional distribution practices), the general financial success of [...] "She Shoulda Said 'No'!" [...] prompted producers, in 1951, to import a similar film from Argentina titled The <b>Marihuana</b> Story. That film, about a doctor who goes undercover into the world of drug addicts to learn about his wife's death only to become addicted to marijuana himself, was not as successful as other exploitation-style efforts as the public was more concerned about drug use by younger people.|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} of the United States Congress to pass the <b>Marihuana</b> Tax Act of 1937 was based on poorly attended hearings and reports based on questionable studies. In 1936 the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) noticed an increase of reports of people smoking marijuana, which further increased in 1937. The Bureau drafted a legislative plan for Congress seeking a new law, {{and the head of}} the FBN, Harry J. Anslinger, ran a campaign against marijuana. Newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst's empire of newspapers used the [...] "yellow journalism" [...] pioneered by Hearst to demonize the cannabis plant and spread a public perception that there were connections between cannabis and violent crime. Several scholars argue that the goal was to destroy the hemp industry, largely as an effort of Hearst, Andrew Mellon and the Du Pont family. They argue that with the invention of the decorticator hemp became a very cheap substitute for the wood pulp that was used in the newspaper industry. However, Hearst newspapers owed large debts to Canadian suppliers of paper, who used wood as raw material. If an alternative raw material for paper had emerged, it would have lowered the price of the paper needed to print Hearst's many newspapers—a positive thing for Hearst. Moreover, by the year 1916 there were at least five [...] "machine brakes" [...] for hemp and it is unlikely that in 1930s hemp became a new threat for newspapers owners.|$|E

United States, {{that there be a}} rational connection between the fact proved and the fact presumed. They had missed the point of that case, where the Court had struck down Timothy Leary's conviction for smuggling marijuana because it could not be rationally presumed, as the <b>Marihuana</b> Tax Act of 1937 did, that someone possessing the drug knew it came from outside the United States. [...] "he issue here is whether the 'fact proved,' (marketing scheme), is too vague a standard to give rise to the 'fact presumed,' (drug-relatedness)," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|Sagan was a {{user and}} {{advocate}} of marijuana. Under the pseudonym [...] "Mr.X", he contributed an essay about smoking cannabis to the 1971 book <b>Marihuana</b> Reconsidered. The essay explained that marijuana use {{had helped to}} inspire some of Sagan's works and enhance sensual and intellectual experiences. After Sagan's death, his friend Lester Grinspoon disclosed this information to Sagan's biographer, Keay Davidson. The publishing of the biography, Carl Sagan: A Life, in 1999 brought media attention to this aspect of Sagan's life. Not long after his death, widow Ann Druyan {{had gone on to}} preside over {{the board of directors of}} the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), a non-profit organization dedicated to reforming cannabis laws.|$|E

The MMAR program was {{intended}} to clearly define the circumstances {{and the manner in}} which access to <b>marihuana</b> for medical purposes would be permitted.

50|$|Leary v. United States, , is a U.S. Supreme Court case {{dealing with}} the {{constitutionality}} of the <b>Marihuana</b> Tax Act of 1937. Timothy Leary, a professor and activist, was arrested for the possession of marijuana in violation of the <b>Marihuana</b> Tax Act. Leary challenged the act on the ground that the act required self-incrimination, which violated the Fifth Amendment. The unanimous opinion of the court was penned by Justice John Marshall Harlan II and declared the <b>Marihuana</b> Tax Act unconstitutional. Thus, Leary's conviction was overturned. Congress responded shortly thereafter by replacing the <b>Marihuana</b> Tax Act with the newly written Controlled Substances Act while continuing the prohibition of certain drugs in the United States.|$|E
