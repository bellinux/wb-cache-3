5|$|Before the First World War, the Spanish Army {{bought a}} Schneider-Brillié in 1909 {{to be used}} in <b>Melilla,</b> where armed {{conflict}} with local tribes was going on. This was a French bus platform that was fitted with an armoured body, to be used as troop transport. Although it was big, slow and its performance was not good, the Spanish Army learned the value of armored vehicles and bought a second one. Spanish Army officers appreciated the advantages of using advanced weapons technology in the Colonial War in Spanish Morocco and followed First World War advances.|$|E
5|$|On 2 January 1492, {{after five}} years of war, the Moorish emirate in Spain came to an end with the Catholic Monarchs' capture of Granada. The Jews of Gibraltar were, like those {{elsewhere}} in the kingdom, expelled from Spain by order of the monarchs in March that year. Gibraltar was used by Medina Sidonia as a base for the Spanish capture of <b>Melilla</b> in North Africa in 1497. Two years later the Muslims of Granada were ordered to convert to Christianity or leave. Those that did not convert left for North Africa, some of them travelling via Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1920s, she {{provided}} fire {{support to the}} Spanish Army in its campaigns in Morocco during the Rif War. On 17 September 1921, she and España bombarded Rif positions south of <b>Melilla</b> while Spanish Foreign Legion troops assaulted the positions. In August 1923, she participated in the first aerial, naval, and land combined arms operation in Spanish military history. In September 1925, she provided fire support for the Al Hoceima landings, a decisive Franco-Spanish operation; there, she served as the flagship of the Spanish naval contingent.|$|E

5|$|She {{fought with}} the Spanish Republican Navy in the Spanish Civil War. At the {{outbreak}} of the Nationalist revolt, wireless operators in the navy headquarters Madrid intercepted radio messages from General Francisco Franco to rebels in Morocco. They alerted the crews aboard Jaime I and other ships, who mutinied against their rebellious officers and ensured the ships would remain under Republican control. The vessels were nevertheless crippled by poor discipline for some time, as they had murdered many of their officers, and distrusted those that were not killed. On the first months of the war, Jaime I shelled a number of rebel strongholds, among them Ceuta, <b>Melilla</b> and Algeciras. In Algeciras she hit with her secondary armament the Nationalist gunboat Eduardo Dato, which was burned down to the waterline, although she was later repaired and returned to service.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s {{and early}} 2000s, several city councils and {{autonomous}} communities had opened registers for civil unions that allowed benefits for unmarried couples of any sex, although {{the effect was}} mainly symbolic. Registries were created in 16 out of 17 of Spain's autonomous communities; Catalonia (1998), Aragon (1999), Navarre (2000), Castile-La Mancha (2000), Valencia (2001), Balearic Islands (2001), Madrid (2001), Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002), Castile and León (2002), Extremadura (2003), Basque Country (2003), Canary Islands (2003), Cantabria (2005), Galicia (2008) and La Rioja (2010), and in both autonomous cities; Ceuta (1998) and <b>Melilla</b> (2008) Spanish law already allowed single people to adopt children; thus, a same-sex couple could undertake a de facto adoption, but the partner who was not the legal parent had no rights if the relationship ended or the legal parent died. Same-sex marriages were not legal in the autonomous communities, because the Spanish Constitution gives the State sole power to legislate marriage.|$|E
25|$|The {{leader of}} the plot, Emilio Mola, had ordered the Army of Africa to revolt at 5 a.m. on July 18, but the plan was {{discovered}} by Republican officers of <b>Melilla</b> on July 17, and the {{leader of the}} plot in the city, Colonel Segui, decided to start the rising on <b>Melilla</b> and arrested General Romerales. The rebels seized the radio station and proclaimed the estado de guerra. The Legionnaries, the Regulares, and the Assault Guards in <b>Melilla</b> joined to the rising. Seizing key buildings, they crushed the resistance in the working class quarters. General Romerales, the major of <b>Melilla,</b> the government delegate, the aerodrome commander, Virgilio Lerez Ruiz, and all those who resisted the rebellion were shot. When General Morato discovered the rising, he took an airplane to <b>Melilla,</b> but he was arrested by the rebels as soon as he landed.|$|E
50|$|The {{fortress}} {{contains many}} of <b>Melilla's</b> most important historical sites, among them an archaeological museum, a military museum, the Church of the Conception, {{and a series}} of caves and tunnels in use since Phoenician times.|$|R
50|$|News of {{the attack}} brought war fever to Spain. The {{government}} dispatched the ironclad Numancia and two gunboats stationed at Málaga, put the fleet on alert, and mobilized the Army of Andalusia for service abroad. Newspapers and patriotic citizens of every stripe clamoured for vengeance at whatever cost in blood or treasure. The troops mobilizing to bolster <b>Melilla's</b> garrison, initially numbering about 3,000, received in many cities ceremonies and ovations from the populace as they moved to the ports.|$|R
50|$|On October 22 the gunboat Conde de Venadito steamed to {{the mouth}} of the Río de Oro, {{anchored}} there, and turned her Hotchkiss guns on the Rif. The ship hurled 31 shells at the Rif trenches and returned to <b>Melilla's</b> harbour without sustaining any damage. 5,000 Rifians in turn made a heavy attack on the heights of Sidi Guariach on October 27 and, despite again running afoul the guns of the Venadito and the Spanish batteries, drove General Margallo and General Ortego back into the citadel and seized their half-finished field works.|$|R
25|$|Ceuta and <b>Melilla</b> are two Spanish {{cities on}} the North African coast. They {{are part of}} the EU but they are {{excluded}} from the common agricultural and fisheries policies. They are also outside the customs union and VAT area, but no customs are levied on goods exported from the Union into either Ceuta and <b>Melilla,</b> and certain goods originating in Ceuta and <b>Melilla</b> are exempt from customs charges.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{original}} {{and for the}} most part unpublished documentation in order to examine the career of Jesús Jiménez Ortoneda, a highly successful career officer who served in the Spanish Protectorate of Morocco between 1907 and 1936. He occupied important positions in the political administration of the Protectorate (as director of the political section of <b>Melilla’s</b> Oficina Central de Intervenciones and a senior official in the Department of Indigenous Affairs); he was fluent in Arab and Tamazight, and gained a sound knowledge of the geography of the Rif mountains. His military career, in which he achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel, was characterized by his strictly professional attitude. He was one of the few career officers in Africa who were faithful to Spain’s republican government and who did not participate in the military uprising of 1936. This discussion of his career brings into question some well-established ideas concerning Spanish colonial policy in Morocco...|$|R
25|$|From 1914 to 1917 he {{attended}} the Superior School of War, during which time (1915) {{he was promoted to}} the rank of Captain of Engineers. In 1919, Arenas Gaspar was given the command of the 2nd Company of Zapadores in <b>Melilla.</b> <b>Melilla</b> is a city under Spanish rule located on the Mediterranean, on the Moroccan coast.|$|E
25|$|The two Governments {{agree that}} a certain extent of Moorish {{territory}} adjacent to <b>Melilla,</b> Ceuta, and other presides should, whenever the Sultan ceases to exercise authority over it, come within the sphere of influence of Spain, and that {{the administration of the}} coast from <b>Melilla</b> as far as, but not including, the heights on the right bank of the Sebou shall be entrusted to Spain.|$|E
25|$|The July 1936 {{military}} {{uprising in}} <b>Melilla</b> {{was a military}} uprising in <b>Melilla,</b> Spain, that occurred July 1718, 1936, {{at the start of}} the Spanish Civil War. The rebels seized the main garrisons of the Spanish Army in Africa and by July 18 had crushed the resistance of the army officers loyal to the Republican government. The supporters of the Second Spanish Republic were detained or shot.|$|E
25|$|The iron {{mines in}} the Rif {{were one of}} the sources of income. Their {{exploitation}} led to an economic boom in <b>Melilla.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the {{autonomous}} cities of Ceuta and <b>Melilla</b> the corresponding health services {{are provided by}} the National Institute of Health Management, INGESA.|$|E
25|$|On 25 September 1998, PauknAir Flight 4101, a BAe 146-100 (registration EC-GEO), {{crashed on}} {{approach}} to runway 15 at <b>Melilla</b> Airport, Spain, killing all 38 passengers and crew.|$|E
25|$|Spain {{is divided}} into 17 {{autonomous}} communities, which in turn are divided into 50 provinces. There are also two autonomous cities: those of Ceuta and <b>Melilla.</b> Finally, each province comprises a number of municipalities.|$|E
25|$|Between 1925 and 1927 Yamin Ben Harroch also {{allocated}} {{money for}} the construction of another Synagogue in his home town of <b>Melilla,</b> Spain, where Enrique Nieto designed the building. This Synagogue was also named Or Zaruaa.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{along with}} the 17 {{autonomous}} communities, two autonomous cities {{are also part of}} the State of Autonomies and are first-order territorial divisions: Ceuta and <b>Melilla.</b> These are two exclaves located in the northern African coast.|$|E
25|$|The {{last visit}} of a Head of State of Spain to Ceuta and <b>Melilla</b> was by king Alfonso XIII, who {{was last seen}} in 1927, and President of the Second Republic, Niceto Alcala Zamora, on 4 November 1933.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a similar}} system for local border traffic permits between Spain and Morocco {{regarding}} Ceuta and <b>Melilla.</b> This system is older and {{was included in the}} 1991 accession treaty of Spain to the Schengen Area.|$|E
25|$|On November 5, while King Juan Carlos I {{was visiting}} Ceuta, Abbas el Fassi {{compared}} {{the situation of}} Ceuta and <b>Melilla</b> to the Israeli occupation of Palestine during a special session of the Moroccan Parliament to discuss the issue.|$|E
25|$|The {{judicial}} decision in Murcia raised speculation in other constituencies where results had been appealed {{that the local}} Superior Courts would follow suit similarly. In Pontevedra, where the number of votes counted was determined to exceed the number of voters, the Court ruled for the election to be held again. Finally, the Superior Court of Andalusia ruled that the election in <b>Melilla</b> was void, but dismissed the appeal on Ceuta where it declared {{the validity of the}} election. González's government announced that it would appeal the decision to the Constitutional Court which, on 25 January 1990, ruled to provisionally suspend the repetition of the legislative elections in Murcia, Pontevedra and <b>Melilla.</b> From 15 to 19 February, the Court overruled the Superior Courts of Justice of Murcia and Galicia and annulled the elections for Murcia and Pontevedra, with declared results being ruled as valid and final. However, it determined that the magnitude of the irregularities found in <b>Melilla</b> was such that a new election was required in the constituency for both the Congress and the Senate, thus definitely ruling as void the results of 29 October. On 25 March 1990, the by-election in <b>Melilla</b> resulted in the PP being awarded the constituency's seat and the two senators from the Socialists, who saw their absolute majority in the Congress snatched away. A by-election was also held on 7 October 1990 in a polling station in Mamblas, Ávila, resulting from a judicial conflict between the PP and the CDS over one senator in the constituency. In the end, the election result allowed the PP to win the disputed senator from the CDS.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the treaty of}} Tordesillas and the treaty of Cintra (18 September 1509) {{established}} {{the limits of the}} Kingdom of Fez for Portugal, and the Castilian expansion was allowed outside these limits, beginning with the conquest of <b>Melilla</b> in 1497.|$|E
25|$|The king of Spain was {{scheduled}} to visit to the autonomous city of <b>Melilla</b> in 1997 {{on the occasion of}} the five hundredth anniversary of the founding of the city, but the pressure of the Moroccan authorities led to the cancellation of the visit.|$|E
25|$|In the North African Spanish {{autonomous}} city of <b>Melilla,</b> Riff Berber is spoken {{by a significant}} part of the population. In the tourist areas of the Mediterranean coast and the islands, English and German are widely spoken by tourists, foreign residents, and tourism workers.|$|E
25|$|The Romans {{interacted with}} and later conquered parts of Mauretania, an early state that covered modern Morocco, western Algeria, and the Spanish cities Ceuta and <b>Melilla</b> during the {{classical}} period. The {{people of the}} region were noted in Classical literature as Mauri, which was subsequently rendered as Moors in English.|$|E
25|$|The harbour of Mostaganem {{had been}} {{captured}} by the Spanish from the Muslims in 1506. The harbour became part of numerous Spanish possessions on the North African coast, which {{had been captured}} since 1496: <b>Melilla</b> (1496), Mers-el-Kebir (1505), Oran (1509), Bougie (1510), Tripoli (1510), Algiers, Shershell, Dellys, Tenes.|$|E
25|$|Llanito, {{the vernacular}} {{language}} {{for the majority}} of Gibraltarians, has significant Jewish influence. Some 500 words are of Hebrew origin, and the language also has features of influence from Haketia, a Judeo-Spanish language spoken by the Sephardic communities of Northern Morocco and the Spanish exclaves of Ceuta and <b>Melilla.</b>|$|E
25|$|As of 2015, Morocco still claims Ceuta and <b>Melilla</b> as {{integral}} {{parts of the}} country, and considers them to be under foreign occupation, comparing their status to that of Gibraltar. Spain considers both cities integral parts of the Spanish geography, since {{they were part of}} Spain for centuries before the Spanish colonial occupation of Morocco.|$|E
