In March 2011 the ECOFIN council reached a preliminary agreement for {{the content of the}} Sixpack with the Commission, and negotiations for endorsement by the European Parliament then started. Ultimately it entered into force 13 December 2011, after one year of preceding negotiations. The six regulations aim at strengthening the procedures to reduce public deficits and address macroeconomic imbalances.|$|E

This was a follow-up on the earlier Stability and Growth Pact and the Euro Plus Pact intended {{as a means of}} optimising <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>surveillance</b> in Europe and avoiding crises in the eurozone in the future. Welcoming the parliament's adoption of the legislation on 28 October 2011, Buzek stated: [...] "The adoption of the six-pack by the whole European Parliament is good news for the European Union. We have a new economic rule-book. We have developed a powerful and resistant armour against any future crises. With the adoption of the six-pack, the EU significantly strengthens its budget discipline and moves towards a true economic governance. We can not turn the clock back, but the package will ensure that Member States budgets will be credible." ...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{monetary}} policy management requires a competent surveillance system capable of analysing the macroeconomic developments, making more accurate projections, and proposing appropriate policy measures. However, {{the development of}} <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>surveillance</b> systems for {{monetary policy}} management in the SEACEN region has not been uniform. Among the 14 SEACEN countries covered in this study, the surveillance systems of Singapore, Korea, ROC(Taiwan), Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines are relatively more developed compared with the systems in Fiji, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Cambodia, Papua New Guinea, Nepal, and Myanmar. Availability, frequency, coverage, timeliness and quality of data have been the major challenges commonly faced in the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>surveillance</b> process particularly in the SEACEN economies with comparatively less developed surveillance systems. In some of these countries, absence of proper institutional setup, lack of technical expertise, lack of coordination between concerned agencies and lack of the knowledge on advanced surveillance methods and models also limit the effectiveness of <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>surveillance.</b> Significant gap between the target of monetary policy and actual target achievement {{in most of these}} countries is also an indicator of the lesser effectiveness of their <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>surveillance.</b> In the case of countries employing comparatively developed surveillance systems, {{there is little or no}} gap between monetary policy target and actual target achievement. In order to enhance the effectiveness and credibility of monetary policy, SEACEN members with less advanced <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>surveillance</b> sytem need to put in place proper institutional set-ups, develop human resources with required technical expertise, enhance the availability, frequency and quality of data; and develop and employ effective surveillance methods and models to strengthen their <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>surveillance.</b> Several new surveillance frameworks have been developed recently to detect the symptoms of a looming crisis so that the crisis can be prevented or the impact of such crisis can be lessened by implementing appropriate measures preemptively. These newly developed frameworks among others include the early warning system (EWS) and balance sheet approach (BSA). Some of the SEACEN countries have already employed or are in the process of employing these frameworks in their surveillance systems. The utilization of these frameworks by all the member countries would be helpful in detecting problems in the SEACEN economies beforehand so that a potential crisis can be averted in the region. As mentioned above, the current <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>surveillance</b> systems of almost half of the SEACEN member countries are fairly developed while those of the other half are relatively less developed. In the process of strengthening their surveillance systems for monetary policy management, the SEACEN members can benefit by sharing their experiences among themselves. The countries with comparatively strong <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>surveillance</b> systems can help to develop and strengthen the surveillance system of other member countries through technical assistance and sharing of experiences. In this regard, The SEACEN Centre can provide a forum to develop necessary skills and share experiences. The new frameworks developed for the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>surveillance</b> focus on the known type of currency and financial crises. Recently, a new type of financial crisis has surfaced in USA in August 2007 originating from the problems in the subprime mortgage lending. The agencies monitoring the economy in the national and international levels employing highly advanced surveillance systems, such as the Federal Reserve, IMF, market participants and credit rating agencies could not read the vulnerabilities present in the market that led to the aforementioned crisis. Because of the increasingly integrated global financial markets and development of uncountable types of new financial products, the global economy may face new types of market vulnerabilities not experienced before. Therefore, SEACEN countries also need to restructure and further strengthen their <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>surveillance</b> systems by taking into consideration the recent developments in the financial markets. There have been several initiatives to establish regional surveillance mechanisms in Asia and the Pacific. However, there is still lack of a permanent mechanism to conduct such regional surveillance effectively on a regular and integrated basis. In this context, instead of increasing the number of initiatives, some of the existing mechanisms can be revived and strengthened. The SEACEN Expert Group on Capital Flows (SEG) may be one such framework which can be utilized more effectively in the regional surveillance. ...|$|E

40|$|When do major states {{conform to}} or diverge from global {{behavioural}} norms? We argue that existing theories {{find it difficult}} to explain important aspects of this variation in behaviour and we offer instead a framework consisting of three explanatory variables: degree of ‘fit’ between global norms and dominant domestic-level norms; actor perceptions of procedural and substantive legitimacy; and actor perceptions of consequences for the global power hierarchy. We argue that the relative importance of these variables is contingent on the level of domestic salience of the issue area. When salience is high, the degree of normative fit is the primary driver of behavioural consistency; when salience is low, degree of fit becomes less important and the other two variables play a more powerful role in driving behavioural outcomes. We demonstrate how this framework helps to account for the behaviour of the two most important states in the global system, China and the United States, in five areas of central importance to the contemporary global order: the limited use of force, <b>macroeconomic</b> policy <b>surveillance,</b> the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, climate protection and financial regulation. Our argument also explains why globalization may reduce rather than increase levels of behavioural consistency with global norms...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{economic}} and financial crises have shown the weakness of EU economic governance. A process of strengthening <b>macroeconomic</b> and fiscal <b>surveillance</b> started {{in the course of}} 2010; the European Commission, among other proposals, suggested a new binding criterion of debt reduction: debt-to-GDP ratio is to be considered sufficiently diminishing if its distance with respect to the 60 % of GDP reference value has reduced over the previous three years at a rate of the order of one-twentieth per year. In this paper we try to evaluate, {{with the support of the}} Oxford Economic Global Model, the economic consequences of the simultaneous attempt of all euro area countries to fulfill this one-twentieth criterion in the 2011 - 2015 period.

40|$|The Europe 2020 {{strategy}} {{lays the}} foundations for “smart, sustainable and inclusive” growth for the decade to come. Alongside this, a three-pronged monitoring mechanism – incorporating fiscal, <b>macroeconomic</b> and thematic <b>surveillance</b> – has {{been put in place}} to coordinate and supervise policies. It is {{in the context of the}} thematic analysis that the commitments made by Member States in favour of the Europe 2020 strategy are examined and their progress measured. The national reform programmes filed each year with the European Commission effectively contain the conversion of the five key European targets – with regard to employment, innovation, education, sustainable development and social inclusion – into national objectives and also the steps that the countries are intending to implement in order to advance along these different paths. The new model of governance – still in progress – was implemented for the first time in 2011, during what has been named the European Semester. The impetus was provided by the Annual Growth Survey carried out in January by the European Commission, which served as a basis for the endorsement of the priorities for fiscal consolidation and structural reforms by the European Council meeting held in the spring. In April, the Member States compiled their national reform programme and their stability or convergence programme. The Commission examined them in May and the European Council approved specific recommendations to each country in June, with the aim of strengthening the cohesion of the national policies planned in the budgets that are to be adopted by Member Sates during the following months, referred to as the National Semester. The mobilisation of countries in favour of the Europe 2020 strategy is proving insufficient in a certain number of fields. As far as the labour market is concerned, assuming that the commitments made by the Member States are honoured, the European strategic target of arriving at an overall employment rate of 75 % by 2020 would not be achieved, since there would be a shortfall of at least 1 percentage point. In the field of research and innovation, the share of GDP taken up by gross domestic expenditure on R&D would remain below the 3 % targeted by the EU. With regard to energy, sharing the effort between the Member States should ensure the achievement of the objectives for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (by 20 % compared to the level of 1990) and raising the share of renewable energy (to reach 20 % of final consumption of energy in 2020) contained in the climate and energy package. Energy efficiency should in turn grow by 20 % within the EU; however, the efforts set out in the national reform programmes are not directly comparable between the countries. The education targets aimed at lowering the school drop-out rate to a level below 10 % and increasing the share of persons between 30 and 34 years of age with tertiary education to at least 40 % would not be honoured either. Lastly, with regard to social cohesion, the Member States are free to choose their national objectives on the basis of the indicators that they deem most appropriate depending on their own situation, in order to make their contribution to the European target of reducing the number of persons at risk of poverty and/or social exclusion by at least 20 million between now and 2020. country recommendations, surveillance, EU 2020, European Semester, governance, integrated guidelines, national reform programme, national targets...|$|R

40|$|This paper re-assesses the {{prospects}} for greater monetary integration in Asia {{in the wake of}} the Asian financial crisis of 1997. The Asian crisis highlighted the absence of well-developed supranational institutions in Asia to provide early warning signals of impending currency or balance of payments problems, access to unconditional funds to cope with financial problems, and a common defensive mechanism to deal with speculative movements in exchange rates. Since 1997 there have been a number of initiatives to enhance monetary cooperation in the region including a Japanese proposal for an Asian Monetary Fund, the Chiang Mai Initiative at the Asean+ 3 meeting in May 2000, the Kobe Research Project, and the currency swap agreements and surveillance machinery initiated at the Asian Development Bank Meeting in Honolulu in May 2001. We find that whilst a common monetary and exchange rate policy in EA is unlikely in the foreseeable future, until the net economic benefits of giving up unilateral exchange rate regimes are more apparent, a good case can be made for placing responsibility for the functions of <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>surveillance</b> and regional resource pooling within a permanent institution which could evolve over time into a fully-fledged Asian Monetary Fund with its own Asia-specific rules on conditionality.

40|$|Three {{years have}} passed since the euro crisis broke out in 2010, {{revealing}} the shortcomings of the EMU architecture as it was foreseen in Maastricht. A number of reforms have been undertaken since 2010 in order to strengthen the Monetary Union, make it more adept to face the challenges of the financial integration that the euro itself created and ensure a stronger resilience to financial crises in the future. To this end, the EMU framework has been strengthened on the side of financial supervision, fiscal discipline and <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>surveillance.</b> Among the various reforms, the agreement to create a Banking Union is certainly a major one and represents probably the most important step towards integration to date.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the information content of the variables that can help detecting external and internal imbalances in an early stage. The starting point is the Scoreboard, where nine indicators are chosen in order to increase <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>surveillance</b> of all member states. Design/methodology/approach – This paper provides an overview of the variables that could be informative for imbalances by focusing on EU- 27 countries over the period 1960 - 2010. The number of chosen variables is 28, and they are aggregated in six macro-areas. Therefore, once an imbalance is observed in any of those areas, it is possible to detect in a simple way which specific variable is determining such outcome. Findings – In general, this approach provides reliable signal to the policy-makers about the indicators that can drive imbalances within the area, shedding light on the relationship among the variables included in the analysis, too. Research limitations/implications – In fact, the empirical results underline some well-known critical issue for several countries, and is largely in line with results obtained in a variety of EC and OECD studies. Originality/value – The main added value of the approach adopted in this paper is the introduction of more variables than those initially proposed by the European Commission in the construction of the Scoreboard. This provides more information about the macroeconomic situation in each country, preserving, however, the simplicity of the analysis as the variables are aggregated by homogeneous areas...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{fiscal surveillance}} {{criteria for the}} countries of the Central African Monetary and Economic Union (CEMAC), most of which depend heavily on oil exports. At present, the CEMAC''s <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>surveillance</b> exercise sets as fiscal target a floor on the basic budgetary balance. This appears inadequate, for at least two reasons. First, fluctuations in oil prices and, hence, oil receipts obscure the underlying fiscal stance. Second, oil resources are limited, which suggests that some of today''s oil receipts should be saved to finance future consumption. The paper develops easy-to-calculate indicators that take both aspects into account. A retrospective analysis based on these alternative indicators reveals that in recent years, the CEMAC''s surveillance exercise has tended to accommodate stances of fiscal policy that are at odds with sound management of oil wealth.

40|$|Legislative {{proposals}} on EU economic governance: {{what is missing}} within and beyond? NOTE This briefing paper will delineate two important additions to the draft by the commission. First, the idea of <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>surveillance</b> {{is a very good}} and necessary one, since we have seen that macroeconomic imbalances have contributed to the propagation of the financial crisis in Europe. Second, the enforcement of the SGP has clearly been lacking during the EU sovereign debt crisis earlier this year. Therefore, I propose a method of implementing sanctions that constitutes a stronger commitment technology than the current one, and resembles the structure of monetary policy making in EMU. By assessing {{only a few of the}} possible indicators, we have already seen that the macroeconomic imbalances were no new phenomenon at the end of 2009. In fact, they have been at play since the start of EMU. This warrants a much larger role for these (and other) indicators to assess the divergences in the Euro area. Furthermore, as many observers have also noted, these divergences have been allowed to grow due to the weak enforcement of the SGP. Consequently, I propose also a Fiscal Experts Panel (FEP) that will provide advice on fiscal policy matters to the European Parliament. Its members have to be “unelected experts appointed for a fixed duration, long enough to make them fully independent and to exceed the horizon of the policy target. ” In addition, they have to have a considerable reputation to give their policy advice enough weight; we can think of i. e. a panel analogous to the Monetary Experts Panel, consisting of those experts knowledgeable on fiscal policy. The FEP will have responsibilities regarding both fiscal imbalances, and will advise on steps that have to be taken once imbalances have been detected...|$|E

The system will act in early 2011. For the first time in history, European financial control agencies will have more seats than national governments. In addition, the European Central Bank will see a branch that will track the emergence of crisis risk. The financial crisis has diminished the EU's growth potential, and made it clear just how interdependent its members' economies are, particularly inside the eurozone. The most important priority now is to restore growth and create effective mechanisms for regulating financial markets - in Europe and internationally. In strengthening its system of economic governance, Europe must learn from previous shortcomings which have put the financial stability of the whole eurozone at risk:- poor observance of the EU's sound rules and procedures for economic policy coordination- insufficient reduction in public debt during the good times – with peer pressure proving an adequate incentive- failure to deal effectively with the build-up of macroeconomic imbalances - despite the Commission's warnings – resulting in high current account deficits, large external indebtedness and high public debt levels in a number of countries (above the official 60 % limit for eurozone countries). Greater economic policy coordination in the EU will be achieved by tools designed to:- strengthen the preventive and corrective arms of the Stability & Growth Pact- address imbalances through stronger <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>surveillance,</b> including alert and sanction mechanisms- set out effective enforcement mechanisms to ensure that member countries will act in compliance with the EU framework they have agreed...|$|E
40|$|The European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is a {{historic}} construction. It is a monetary union among sovereign states that have surrendered their monetary policy and entered a fixed exchange rate regime, while maintaining an autonomous fiscal policy. Internal and external macroeconomic imbalances have developed between the member states since {{the creation of the}} monetary union, but the effect of this development became more visible after the financial crisis, as it led to some European states requiring emergency assistance from the IMF and the EU. This thesis studies whether the development of imbalances in three southern European countries, namely Greece, Italy and Spain, were: (a) the result of purely domestic sources; (b) the result of domestic difficulties amplified by EMU membership; or (c) the result of these countries joining the EMU, regardless of their domestic state of affairs prior to membership. The purpose is to understand what caused the imbalances to develop, as this has implications for the long run survival of the EMU, as well as how to construct potential new monetary unions between sovereign states. The method used is a country-specific case study of Greece, Italy and Spain, highlighting the differences and similarities of macroeconomic and microeconomic variables as well as policies between the countries from 1992 until 2011. To reveal when the imbalances started to develop the sample years have been divided into three periods: a pre-EMU, a core-EMU and a crisis-response period. The results are discussed for each country to discover the sources of the internal and external imbalances, and to evaluated whether the already suggest policy measures will remedy and hinder reoccurrence of the current problems in the EMU. The outcome of the case study is that the EMU membership amplified existing domestic imbalances in Greece, Italy and Spain. This amplification happened due to the more integrated financial market that led to the disappearance of the long-term interest rate spreads, resulting in easier access to credit for the government. Italy and Greece took advantage of this, while in Spain, the more integrated financial market caused the private sector to take on excessive debt. Greece, Italy and Spain experienced higher cost growth relative to the other EMU member countries, causing above average inflation and an appreciation of the real exchange rate. The countries lost competitive power relative to the other EMU member states and emerging markets. Identified sources of external imbalances were declining private and public saving rates combined with increased investment that created balance of trade deficits. Italy and Greece exemplify that a monetary union between sovereign states is doomed to fail when the regulatory framework lacks strong sanction possibilities. This is due to moral hazard on both the lending side, represented by the financial institutions, and on the borrowing side, represented by the governments. The presented evidence suggests that stricter financial regulation and firmer sanctions in the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) are needed if the EMU is to survive in the long run, as the control mechanisms of the countries’ fiscal policy were too weak, relative to the large negative spillover effects from reckless borrowing. The policy implications that inform this, is that the EMU do not need to form a federal state or a fiscal union to survive in the long run, if the new <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>surveillance</b> regime as well as the SGP is obeyed to by all member states, in addition to implementation of an EMU-wide financial regulation framework. The main findings of this study can be generalized to other potential monetary unions in the making without a fiscal union, keeping in mind the limited nature of examining only three of the current 17 EMU member states...|$|E
