500|$|In an {{interview}} for Just Jared, Rihanna explained how the bright and colorful was more representational of her persona, saying [...] "I've started to incorporate {{a lot of different}} colors into <b>my</b> <b>wardrobe</b> now. I'm loving that direction. Right now, it feels good and right. It was a cool concept too because it was kind of one side of me and now, it's evolving into the new colorful stuff that we've been doing." [...] In {{an interview}} for MTV News, Guetta explained his role in the music video, saying [...] "I'm DJing from a spaceship. It's actually really funny, because we shot that in Los Angeles in a place where they used to shoot Star Trek, but like the old ones. And so it's kind of retro futuristic, you know? It's like how people were seeing the future back in the 80s. It has a sense of humor in the video." [...] The nighttime version was released as the song's official music video to download digitally on 1 February 2011.|$|E
500|$|A {{lot of my}} {{performances}} {{have had}} fire involved, so we thought 'Heat.' Also, red {{is one of my}} favorite colors, as is gold. So then we thought of making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — my mother had a collection of them when I was growing up. I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with <b>my</b> <b>wardrobe,</b> I always try to find things that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me. When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken me three, four, however many years — this was my first fragrance, and I wanted to make sure that it was something I would love forever.|$|E

On his {{personal}} website he had this to say: [...] "Those who know me know that I am an inconvertible Anglophile – or more broadly, a Britanophile, which includes my affection for Scotland and Wales as well. I love things British. My car is British. <b>My</b> <b>wardrobe,</b> to a good extent, is British. I even love the food in London – I think British food has shaken its prevailing perception as indigestible and become quite wonderful. I {{try to get to}} Britain for holidays as often as I can. I love things British." ...|$|E

2500|$|You know, {{its engine}} sound was {{different}} from other planes; that is, the president's engine's sound ... We were looking towards where the plane was coming from, and we saw a projectile and we saw a ball of flame or flash and we saw the plane go down; and I saw it. I {{was the leader of}} the bloc so I asked the soldiers to get up and I told them [...] "Get up because Kinani [...] has been shot down.' They told me, [...] "You are lying."

2500|$|The {{change in}} {{wardrobe}} {{was a factor}} Hendrickson especially needed to become accustomed to. [...] "On my first day, Maggie was wearing a miniskirt," [...] she said. [...] "In one of the scenes, Bianca fainted to the floor, {{and we had to}} do a few takes. The one that they [...] was when I went to catch her and bent over, forgetting that I was wearing a miniskirt. When I realized, I turned to everyone and was like, ' Oh, my goodness! I flashed the entire set. Sorry, guys. I'm not used to wearing miniskirts on the show [...] I'm used to wearing baggy pants!.'" [...] Though the change in wardrobe was a different feel, Hendrickson welcomed the new look. [...] "I used to get a little frustrated with what I wore as Frankie; I was sick of looking like a rugrat," [...] she stated. [...] "But now, I really like <b>my</b> <b>wardrobe.</b> I'm excited that Maggie wears skirts all the time!" ...|$|E

"Actually I {{have nothing}} to wear," [...] began Fan impressively; [...] "I 've been too busy to think or care till now, but here it is nearly May and I have hardly a decent rag to my back. Usually, you know, I just go to Mrs. O'Grady and tell her what I want; she makes <b>my</b> spring <b>wardrobe,</b> Papa pays the bill, and there I am.

[...] "Now that I have {{you to help me}} to choose, I think I will be extravagant enough to renew <b>my</b> entire <b>wardrobe.</b> I wish you would take this {{opportunity}} to get some things for yourself. You will find that my dress-maker, Madame Smith, is to be depended on for work, though she is expensive and dishonest.

5000|$|From February to March 2014 she {{appeared}} on a dramatised crime biography, Fat Tony & Co., portraying Judy Moran, wife of Lewis Moran {{who was part of}} the Carlton Crew which were involved in the Melbourne gangland killings. Fat Tony & Co. focused on {{the rise and fall of}} convicted drug mastermind, Tony Mokbel, and is an offshoot to the first series of Underbelly (February-May 2008). Byrne described her portrayal of Moran [...] "You'd be surprised what I wear as Judy that's from <b>my</b> own <b>wardrobe</b> ... There's a definite air of the theatrical about her and a lot of what I saw Judy wearing ... I thought she wore some really nice clothes. Everything she wore was so over the top." ...|$|R

Of the video, Reinhart described [...] "I {{took it to the}} rooftops with a live band, brought in <b>my</b> personal <b>wardrobe</b> and continued the floral theme -- as seen in the album artwork. Casey Curry really helped bring my vision to life. I wanted it to be simple, sexy, playful and real. Forget the bells and whistles!

60|$|But Rowley {{hastened to}} reassure me. On {{the first word}} of my coming the Count had put the matter of <b>my</b> <b>wardrobe</b> {{in the hands of}} his own and my cousin's tailors; and on the rumour of our resemblance, my clothes had been made to Alain's measure.|$|E

6000|$|Yes! I {{am going}} to be married to Dora! Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa have given their consent; and if ever canary birds were in a flutter, they are.

A dressmaker, always stabbed in the breast with a needle and thread, boards and lodges in the house; and seems to me, eating, drinking, or sleeping, never to take her thimble off. They make a lay-figure of my dear. They are always sending for her to come and try something on. We can't be happy together for five minutes in the evening, but some intrusive female knocks at the door, and says, 'Oh, if you please, Miss Dora, would you step upstairs!' ...|$|R

6000|$|We at {{once put}} {{ourselves}} in travelling trim. Just previous to leaving Tahiti, having found <b>my</b> <b>wardrobe</b> reduced to two suits (frock and trousers, both much {{the worse for}} wear), I had quilted them together for mutual preservation (after a fashion peculiar to sailors); engrafting a red frock upon a blue one, and producing thereby a choice variety {{in the way of}} clothing. This was the extent of <b>my</b> <b>wardrobe.</b> Nor was the doctor by any means better off. His improvidence had at last driven him to don the nautical garb; but by this time his frock--a light cotton one--had almost given out, and he had nothing to replace it. Shorty very generously offered him one which was a little less ragged; but the alms were proudly refused; Long Ghost preferring to assume the ancient costume of Tahiti--the [...] "Roora." ...|$|E
60|$|However, {{a blessed}} {{break in the}} monotony of my fare came during April when my friend Bashford invited me to visit him in Portland.

60|$|I do {{not know}} whether His gracious Majesty was much {{affected}} by this sudden demise of my father, though my mother says he shed some royal tears on the occasion.

My father's body accompanied us in the finest hearse and plumes money could buy; for though the husband and wife had quarrelled repeatedly in life, yet at my father's death his high-spirited widow forgot all her differences, gave him the grandest funeral that had been seen for many a day, and erected a monument over his remains (for which I subsequently paid), which declared him to be the wisest, purest, and most affectionate of men.|$|R

So, I will do {{the next best thing to}} be wishing all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. There was a time about last Christmas that the BSC sent me a gift. It was a nice warm pair of stockings that reached clear up to the knees but again I was in a temperate climate and away they went to the bottom of <b>my</b> Army <b>Wardrobe.</b> <b>My</b> only thought was to be transferred to Alaska or some such very unwarm spot so that I could have some use for them. I 2 ̆ 7 m not in Alaska but they are getting wear here in St. Joe, Weather, 15 degrees below. Well, I would like to keep on but rather than become boring I 2 ̆ 7 ll close with one last request. I would like to know of Bryant Activities and also news of Service Men such as Harry Smith 2 ̆ 742, Evald Nilson 2 ̆ 742 and so many others that I once knew as brothers. Keep me tabbed?
