30|$|According to the Pearson’s {{similarity}} theory, x has {{the strong}} correlation with y when |r| {{is greater than}} 0.7; x has the general correlation with y when |r| is from 0.4 to 0.7; x has the weak correlation with y when |r| is smaller than 0.4. Taking the public buildings’ CAC load in a region {{of the city of}} Nanjing as an example, the Pearson’s correlation coefficients between public building’s CAC load and different meteorological parameters for every hour from June 15 th to September 15 th of 2013 are calculated as follows: (a) For the <b>meteorological</b> <b>parameter</b> of temperature, r equals 0.758; (b) For the <b>meteorological</b> <b>parameter</b> of humidity, r equals − 0.704; (c) For the <b>meteorological</b> <b>parameter</b> of atmospheric pressure, r equals − 0.344; (d) For the <b>meteorological</b> <b>parameter</b> of wind velocity, r equals 0.189; (e) For the <b>meteorological</b> <b>parameter</b> of rainfall, r equals − 0.207. It can be seen that, the <b>meteorological</b> <b>parameter</b> of temperature and humidity have the strong correlation with the public building’s CAC load. Therefore, these two meteorological parameters are selected to participate in the short term load forecasting for public building’s CAC baseline load.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{measuring}} <b>meteorological</b> <b>parameters</b> is defining the air density, {{through which the}} electromagnetic wave spreads. In practice, most commonly measured <b>meteorological</b> <b>parameters</b> are measured at the endpoint of the measured distance, which, at long distances, may cause an unreasonable simplification. The basic idea of the thesis was thus to measure the <b>meteorological</b> <b>parameters</b> {{on the path of}} the measured beam in the air. In this way we obtain more precise information on the actual conditions in the atmosphere. We expect that the resulting data that reflect the actual conditions in the atmosphere, affect the long-distance measurements significantly. For measuring <b>meteorological</b> <b>parameters</b> in the air, we used an ultra-light aircraft which allows flying at low speed. We carried out three flights in three different atmosphere conditions (a hot afternoon and evening atmosphere, respectively, and a fresh morning atmosphere). Within one year we performed two independent measurements of the two distances measured. The thesis intends to answer the hypothesis formed: Can different consideration of the <b>meteorological</b> <b>parameters</b> significantly influence the calculation of the real atmosphere and thus affect the measured distance reduction? The analysis wants to critically evaluate the existing calculation methods, available in the literature and acquire optimum method of considering the <b>meteorological</b> <b>parameters</b> when calculating the actual atmosphere in measuring long-distant distances in difficult measurement conditions...|$|R

40|$|The global solar {{radiation}} is an important <b>meteorological</b> <b>parameter</b> for understanding the biochemical processes in the environment. Their measurement is complex and requires a high cost of installation, operation and maintenance, but this can be estimated by empirical equations based primarily on their geolocation. However, {{the accuracy of the}} results obtained is not suitable for understanding the processes evaluated. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish a statistical correlation model for estimating global {{solar radiation}} from alternative <b>meteorological</b> <b>parameter.</b> The meteorological information was provided by the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies of Colombia, which provided the measurement of solar radiation, temperature, relative humidity and sunshine of the day for a year.

The results show a good statistical correlation between variables solar radiation, temperature and relative humidity and little relation to the hours of sunshine, where relative humidity has the higher correlation and therefore is the parameter that more influence has on the model. The multivariate models (R 2 average 11. 91 %) have better fit than simple models (R 2 average 5. 66 %).
