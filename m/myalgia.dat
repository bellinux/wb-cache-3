5|$|At {{the end of}} November 1915, Sing {{suffered}} from <b>myalgia</b> and was confined to the hospital ship HMHS Gloucester Castle for almost two weeks. During this time, he was conveyed to Malta, then Ismaïlia, Egypt. While in Egypt, he was also hospitalised with parotitis and mumps, but rejoined his unit {{at the end of}} March 1916.|$|E
5|$|In their 2002 book Myofascial Pain and Fibromyalgia: Trigger Point Management authors {{orthopedic}} surgeon Edward S. Rachlin and physical therapist Isabel Rachlin recommended {{use of the}} Magic Wand for self-treatment by patients with <b>myalgia.</b> They wrote that continued use of the Magic Wand on myofascial trigger points or tense areas of muscle could result in decreasing the amount of discomfort felt by patients. Rachlin and Rachlin suggested that such treatment {{could be done in}} one's residence outside of a clinical setting.|$|E
25|$|About 95% of {{symptomatic}} cases report joint pain. This {{is typically}} symmetrical and with acute onset, affecting the fingers, toes, ankles, wrists, back, knees and elbows. Fatigue occurs in 90% and fever, <b>myalgia</b> and headache occur in 50–60%.|$|E

40|$|A 69 year-old {{male with}} a past medical history of hyperlipidemia, GERD, and {{transitional}} cell {{carcinoma of the}} bladder currently in remission {{was admitted to the}} hospital with increasing fatigue, arthralgias, and <b>myalgias.</b> He noted that his symptoms began approximately four weeks prior to admission after working outside in his yard and on his swimming pool. He stated that one week later he developed red blotches on his thighs, abdomen and chest followed by arthralgias and <b>myalgias.</b> He noted there were ticks where he was working but could not recall a definite tick bite, nor did he find evidence of one. On further questioning he revealed that his neighbor had Lyme disease in the past, and his dog also had Lyme disease.

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that 5-HTP may cause eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS), a serious condition which results in extreme muscle tenderness, <b>myalgia,</b> and blood abnormalities. However, there is evidence to show that EMS was likely caused by a contaminant in certain 5-HTP supplements.|$|E
25|$|The common, adverse drug {{reactions}} (side effects) are {{the same}} as with other PDE5 inhibitors. The frequent vardenafil-specific side-effect is nausea; the infrequent side effects are abdominal pain, back pain, photosensitivity, abnormal vision, eye pain, facial edema, hypotension, palpitation, tachycardia, arthralgia, <b>myalgia,</b> rash, itch, and priapism.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} adverse {{reactions}} (≥20% occurrence, {{leading to a}} 11% treatment discontinuation rate) observed with sirolimus in clinical studies {{for the treatment of}} lymphangioleiomyomatosis are: peripheral edema, hypercholesterolemia, abdominal pain, headache, nausea, diarrhea, chest pain, stomatitis, nasopharyngitis, acne, upper respiratory tract infection, dizziness, and <b>myalgia.</b>|$|E
40|$|Daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, and 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl – {{coenzyme}} A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) {{are commonly}} administered in {{the inpatient setting}} and are associated with creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevations, <b>myalgias,</b> and muscle weakness. Safety data for coadministration of daptomycin with statins are limited. To determine the safety of coadministration of daptomycin with statin therapy, a multicenter, retrospective, observational study was performed at 13 institutions in the Southeastern United States. Forty-nine adult patients receiving statins concurrently with daptomycin were compared with 171 patients receiving daptomycin without statin therapy. Detailed information, including treatment indication and duration, infecting pathogen, baseline and subsequent CPK levels, and presence of <b>myalgias</b> or muscle complaints, was col-lected. <b>Myalgias</b> were noted in 3 / 49 (6. 1 %) patients receiving combination therapy compared with 5 / 171 (2. 9 %) of patients re-ceiving daptomycin alone (P 0. 38). CPK elevations of> 1, 000 U/liter occurred in 5 / 49 (10. 2 %) patients receiving combination therapy compared to 9 / 171 (5. 3 %) patients receiving daptomycin alone (P 0. 32). Two of five patients experiencing CPK eleva-tions of> 1, 000 U/liter in the combination group had symptoms of myopathy. Three patients (6. 1 %) discontinued therapy due to CPK elevations with concurrent <b>myalgias</b> in the combination group versus 6 patients (3. 5 %) in the daptomycin-alone group (P 0. 42). CPK levels and <b>myalgias</b> reversed upon discontinuation of daptomycin therapy. Overall musculoskeletal toxicity was numerically higher in the combination group but this result was not statistically significant.

25|$|The winds carry Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii spores into nonendemic areas, a {{pathogenic}} fungus {{that causes}} Coccidioidomycosis ("Valley Fever"). Symptomatic infection (40 percent of cases) usually presents as an influenza-like illness with fever, cough, headaches, rash, and <b>myalgia</b> (muscle pain). Serious complications include severe pneumonia, lung nodules, and disseminated disease, where the fungus spreads throughout the body. The disseminated form of Coccidioidomycosis can devastate the body, causing skin ulcers, abscesses, bone lesions, severe joint pain, heart inflammation, urinary tract problems, meningitis, and often death.|$|E
25|$|Xerostomia may {{be caused}} by {{autoimmune}} damage to the salivary glands. Sjögren's syndrome is one such disease, and it causes other symptoms, including xerophthalmia (dry eyes), dry vagina, fatigue, <b>myalgia</b> (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain). Females are more likely to suffer from autoimmune disease, and 90% of people with Sjögren's syndrome are women. Primary Sjögren's syndrome is the combination of dry eyes and xerostomia. Secondary Sjögren's syndrome is identical to primary form but {{with the addition of a}} combination of other connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|Potentially painful cancer {{treatments}} include immunotherapy which may produce joint or muscle pain; radiotherapy, {{which can cause}} skin reactions, enteritis, fibrosis, myelopathy, bone necrosis, neuropathy or plexopathy; chemotherapy, often associated with mucositis, joint pain, muscle pain, peripheral neuropathy and abdominal pain due to diarrhea or constipation; hormone therapy, which sometimes causes pain flares; targeted therapies, such as trastuzumab and rituximab, which can cause muscle, joint or chest pain; angiogenesis inhibitors like bevacizumab, known to sometimes cause bone pain; and surgery, which may produce post-operative pain, post-amputation pain or pelvic floor <b>myalgia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{cases have}} been {{associated}} with acute fever, <b>myalgias,</b> bronchospasm, pruritic rashes, lymphadenopathy, subcutaneous nodules associated with eosinophilia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and elevated creatinine kinase levels.

40|$|A 34 -year-old man {{presented}} with a 5 -day history of rapid onset weakness of the left wrist flexor mus-cles, associated with fever, sore throat, arthralgias, and <b>myalgias.</b> A literature review to answer the question, “What could cause focal muscle weakness, fever, and <b>myalgias?</b> ” yielded several case reports describing initial presentations of polymyositis or unusual presentations of various infectious agents. Interestingly, the man in our case had a cousin in France, {{with whom he had}} no recent contact, who {{presented with}} the same symptoms approximately 3 months earlier. Because of our patient’s recent travel history, testing was performed for Lyme disease, confirming our diagnosis.

25|$|In humans, a {{characteristic}} of poisoning by the nephrotoxin orellanine is the long latency; the first symptoms usually do not appear until 2–3 days after ingestion and can in some cases {{take as long as}} 3 weeks. The first symptoms of orellanine poisoning are similar to the common flu (nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, headaches, <b>myalgia,</b> etc.), these symptoms are followed by early stages of renal failure (immense thirst, frequent urination, pain on and around the kidneys) and eventually decreased or nonexistent urine output and other symptoms of renal failure occur. If left untreated death will follow.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{studies have}} shown that chronic {{administration}} of diazepam or bromazepam causes a decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity, decreased turnover of noradrenaline and dopamine and serotonin, increased activity of tyrosine hydroxylase and increased levels of the catecholamines. During withdrawal of bromazepam or diazepam a fall in tryptophan, serotonin levels occurs as part of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Changes in the levels of these chemicals in the brain can cause headaches, anxiety, tension, depression, insomnia, restlessness, confusion, irritability, sweating, dysphoria, dizziness, derealization, depersonalization, numbness/tingling of extremities, hypersensitivity to light, sound, and smell, perceptual distortions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, appetite loss, hallucinations, delirium, seizures, tremor, stomach cramps, <b>myalgia,</b> agitation, palpitations, tachycardia, panic attacks, short-term memory loss, and hyperthermia.|$|E
25|$|A study {{involving}} 2408 donors (18–60 years) {{indicated that}} bone pain (primarily back and hips) {{as a result}} of filgrastim treatment is observed in 80 percent of donors by day 4 post-injection. This pain responded to acetaminophen or ibuprofen in 65 percent of donors and was characterized as mild to moderate in 80 percent of donors and severe in 10 percent. Bone pain receded post-donation to 26 percent of patients 2 days post-donation, 6 percent of patients one week post-donation, and <2 percent 1 year post-donation. Donation is not recommended for those with a history of back pain. Other symptoms observed in more than 40 percent of donors include <b>myalgia,</b> headache, fatigue, and insomnia. These symptoms all returned to baseline 1 month post-donation, except for some cases of persistent fatigue in 3 percent of donors.|$|E
50|$|Patients display early {{symptoms}} within 1 to 2 {{weeks after}} tick infection. Early symptoms include fever, headache, malaise, low-back pain, or gastrointestinal symptoms.

40|$|Acute viral {{myositis}} {{is a rare}} {{condition that}} occurs during the recovery phase of an illness, most commonly influenza. It is characterized by muscle pain and weakness with an isolated laboratory finding of elevated serum creatine kinase (CK). We describe three previously healthy patients who were hospitalized after developing myositis following influenza-like illness during the 2009 influenza A (H 1 N 1) virus pandemic. All experienced <b>myalgias</b> and weakness in all four extremities, including distal upper extremities, associated with an elevated CK level that resolved along with their <b>myalgias</b> and weakness within one week with supportive care.

40|$|Cramps and <b>myalgias</b> are {{frequent}} presentations of many disorders whose diagnosis is generally difficult. Among the unusual causes stand the milder phenotypes of dystrophinopathies, which are caused, just as Duchenne and Becker’s dystrophy, by mutations in the dystrophin gene. An 8 year-old boy presented severe muscle pain on exercise and serum rise in creatine kinase over 1000 U/l. He had normal muscle power and mild calf hypertrophy. The molecular analysis by {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) of the dystrophin gene showed deletions of exons 45 to 51. Dystrophin analysis by Western blot revealed a dystrophin of reduced quantity and molecular weight. Emphasis is made to include dystrophinopathies in the differential diagnosis of <b>myalgias</b> and the usefulness of molecular genetic techniques {{in the identification of}} these disorders (Rev Méd Chile 2000; 128 : 772 - 7) ...|$|R
25|$|The {{withdrawal}} symptoms for opiates may include severe dysphoria, craving for another opiate dose, irritability, sweating, nausea, rhinorrea, tremor, vomiting and <b>myalgia.</b> Slowly reducing the intake of opioids over {{days and weeks}} can reduce or eliminate the {{withdrawal symptoms}}. The speed and severity of withdrawal depends on the half-life of the opioid; heroin and morphine withdrawal occur more quickly and are more severe than methadone withdrawal. The acute withdrawal phase is often followed by a protracted phase of depression and insomnia that can last for months. The symptoms of opioid withdrawal can be treated with other medications, such as clonidine. Physical dependence does not predict drug misuse or true addiction, and {{is closely related to}} the same mechanism as tolerance. While there is anecdotal claims of benefit with ibogaine, data to support its use in substance dependence is poor.|$|E
