The production and the use of chemicals and fuels from biomass [9, 21 – 23] seem to be an ideal solution to tackle environmental issues and fossil resources progressive depletion, if correct measures are taken. In that context, biomass-derived platform molecules, such as maleic acid, fumaric acid or maleic anhydride have been identified as top value-added chemicals. Therefore, a highly effective method to produce these dicarboxylic acids from biomass is necessary. Moreover, from the industrial application point of view, this method should be simple and environmentally friendly. In this context, heterogeneous catalysis could bring new economic and environmental solutions. Indeed, nowadays, new synthesis techniques permit to control the morphology and physical and chemical properties of the catalysts. This yields in higher conversion rates and selectivities.

Artificial RV model genomes encoding bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or firefly luciferase were used to determine the polymerase activity of a series of 23 RV L proteins mutated in the highly conserved C motif of the proposed polymerase module. All constructs with mutations of the GDN core sequence of motif C, which is proposed to be a variant of the catalytical XDD residues of RNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases, failed to express the reporter genes. In addition, the identity of the upstream residues AQ was crucial for maintenance of polymerase activity.

The L protein in peak I showed significant transcriptional activity in an in vitro transcription reconstitution experiment, whereas the L protein in peak II was inactive. Interestingly, the addition of cytoplasmic extract from uninfected Sf 21 cells to peak II completely restored transcription in vitro, indicating the requirement of a host factor(s) for the activity of the L protein.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) results showed Cu/Pt co-doped ZrO 2 nanoparticles with a size of ca. 10 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectra confirmed cubic structure and larger oxygen vacancies. The nanoparticles showed excellent activity for CO oxidation. The temperature T 50 (the temperature at which 50 % of CO are converted) was lowered by 175 °C in comparison to bare ZrO 2. Further, they exhibited very high stability for CO reaction (time-on-stream ≈ 70 h). This is due to combined effect of smaller particle size, large oxygen vacancies, high specific surface area and better thermal stability of the Cu/Pt co-doped ZrO 2 nanoparticles.

Remarkably, the turnover frequency in the case of 4 -nitrophenol using Au@DHBP NPs reaches 800 h- 1, outperforming previously reported Au NP-based catalytic systems.

Some selectivity issues are, however, difficult to solve using the traditional methods. Therefore we have an interest in the development of new approaches using supramolecular chemistry, guided by the lessons that we can learn from Nature. Here we introduce and develop DIMPhos, a new class of bidentate phosphorus ligands equipped with an integral anion binding site. The supramolecular interactions between the binding pocket of the Rh(DIMPhos) -catalysts and substrates containing anionic functionalities provide an excellent design concept to achieve remote control of the regioselectivity in hydroformylation by substrate pre-organization. The carefully designed ligand-substrate interactions allow for an unprecedented full reversal of selectivity to otherwise unfavorable products, thus opening up novel pathways in chemical synthesis. Further, the pocket of the Rh(DIMPhos) -catalysts can also be used for catalyst tuning by binding small cofactors - anions of chiral acids - allowing for supramolecular modulation of the enantioselectivity of the catalyst.

In this context, biomass represents an attractive alternative because of its sustainability and its abundance. The catalytic conversion of biomass gives access to various chemical intermediates and potential fuels. As biomass exhibit many functional groups, generally it is converted into so-called platform molecules, which can be transformed to valuable chemicals by de- and refunctionalisation. This transformation requires new catalyst design as well was new process strategies to enable an efficient and selective access to the desired products. This thesis describes a new range of products from fufuralacetone accessible via <b>multifunctional</b> <b>catalytic</b> systems. At first, the potential products from furfuralacetone were identified and a suitable catalytic system was evaluated. Especially, in ionic liquids (IL) stabilised transition metal nanoparticles showed very promising activity and selectivity. It was possible to synthesis four different hydrogenation products starting from furfuralacetone selectively by employing various IL-stabilised nanoparticles. Particularly ruthenium nanoparticles stabilised in 1 - dodecyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethansulfonyl) imid Ru@[C 12 MIM][NTf 2] exhibited high activity and selectivity in the conversion of furfuralacetone to the fully hydrogenated product 2 -(4 -tatrahydrofuryl) -butanol. Furthermore, recycling experiments of Ru@[C 12 MIM][NTf 2] showed no loss of reactivity or selectivity over fife cycles. In comparison to classic homogeneous and heterogeneous rutheniums catalyst the nanoparticles systems were much more reactive and tolerant towards biomass substrates and were able to hydrogenate various bio-based molecules. Moreover, by immobilising the nanoparticles on a solid support it was possible to apply the catalyst in continuous hydrogenation of furfuralacetone in supercritcial CO 2. Modification of the nanoparticle systems was possible by functionalisation of the ionic liquids with sulfonic groups. The introduction of an acidic group lead to <b>multifunctional</b> <b>catalytic</b> systems with a redoxactive and an acidic site. These catalytic systems were very active in the hydrogenation and dehydration of 4 -(2 -tetrahydrofuryl) -butanol to 2 -butyltetrahydrofuran and the C 8 -OL products 1 -octanol and 1, 1 -dioctylether. By varying the ionic liquid and the reaction conditions it was possible to tune the selectivity to the desired product with a high selectivity towards secondary alcohols. Only traces of the fully hydrogenated product octane were observed. The combination of the hydrogenation step with the following hydrogenation and dehydration in a two step-one pot reaction gave access to the valuable C 8 -OL products with a selectivity of 93 %. No purification in between was necessary. Furthermore, by immobilising the nanoparticles on acidic functionalised support it was even possible to recycle the catalytic system without loss in activity and selectivity.

Centro de Bioinformatica y Simulacion Molecular (CBSM), Universidad de Talca, 2 Norte 685, Casilla 721, Talca - ChileRotavirus NSP 2 is an {{abundant}} non-structural RNA-binding protein essential for forming the viral factories that support replication of the double-stranded RNA genome. NSP 2 exists as stable doughnut-shaped octamers within the infected cell, representing the tail-to-tail interaction of two tetramers. Extending diagonally {{across the surface}} of each octamer are four highly basic grooves that function as binding sites for single-stranded RNA. Between the N and C-terminal domains of each monomer is a deep electropositive cleft containing a catalytic site that hydrolyzes the γ-β phosphoanhydride bond of any NTP. The catalytic site has similarity to those of the histidine triad (HIT) family of nucleotide-binding proteins. Due to the close proximity of the grooves and clefts, we investigated the possibility that the RNA-binding activity of the groove promoted the insertion of the 5 ′-triphosphate moiety of the RNA into the cleft, and the subsequent hydrolysis of its γ-β phosphoanhydride bond. Our results show that NSP 2 hydrolyzes the γP from RNAs and NTPs through Mg 2 +-dependent activities that proceed with similar reaction velocities, that require the catalytic His 225 residue, and that produce a phosphorylated intermediate. Competition assays indicate that although both substrates enter the active site, RNA is the preferred substrate due to its higher affinity for the octamer. The RNA triphosphatase (RTPase) activity of NSP 2 may account for the absence of the 5 ′-terminal γP on the (−) strands of the double-stranded RNA genome segments. This is the first report of a HIT-like protein with a <b>multifunctional</b> <b>catalytic</b> site, capable of accommodating both NTPs and RNAs during γP hydrolysis...|$|R

A protocol has been developed for the synthesis of recombinant L protein that will support viral mRNA synthesis in vitro. COS cells were transfected with a transient expression vector (pSV-VSL 1 [M. Schubert, G. G. Harmison, C. D. Richardson, and E. Meier, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 : 7984 - 7988, 1985]) which contains the simian virus 40 late promoter for the transcription of a cDNA copy of the L protein of the Indiana serotype of VSV. Cytoplasmic extracts of these cells efficiently transcribed VSV mRNAs in vitro in conjunction with N protein-RNA template purified from virus and recombinant phosphoprotein synthesized in Escherichia coli. mRNA synthesis was completely dependent upon addition of both bacterial phosphoprotein and extracts from cells transfected with the L gene. Extracts from mock-transfected cells or from cells transfected with the expression vector alone did not support VSV RNA synthesis. RNA synthesis was proportional to the concentration of cell extract used, with an optimum of 0. 2 mg/ml. Rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses contain a highly conserved GDNQ motif which was mutated in the transfected L gene. All constructs with mutations within the core GDN abrogated transcriptional activity except for the mutant containing GDD, which retained 25 % activity. Conserved amino acid changes outside of the core GDN and changes corresponding to other paromyxovirus and rhabdovirus L proteins retained variable transcriptional activity.

2500|$|Several {{phenomena}} become pronounced as {{the size}} of the system decreases. These include statistical mechanical effects, as well as quantum mechanical effects, for example the [...] "quantum size effect" [...] where the electronic properties of solids are altered with great reductions in particle size. This effect does not come into play by going from macro to micro dimensions. However, quantum effects can become significant when the nanometer size range is reached, typically at distances of 100 nanometers or less, the so-called quantum realm. Additionally, a number of physical (mechanical, electrical, optical, etc.) properties change when compared to macroscopic systems. One example is the increase in surface area to volume ratio altering mechanical, thermal and catalytic properties of materials. Diffusion and reactions at nanoscale, nanostructures materials and nanodevices with fast ion transport are generally referred to nanoionics.

This {{has led to a}} significant influence in the worldwide economy, with 20 % of it depending on catalysis. Current reliance of the industrial world on catalysis and rapidly increasing worldwide energy prices have motivated the search for improved catalysts allowing more energy-efficient processes. Catalysts performance is affected by the shape, structure, and chemical composition of the catalysts. Fortunately, {{the development of}} nanotechnology has allowed researchers to control the structure and morphology of catalyst nanoparticles, {{as well as that of}} solid supports. Even though, these approaches have enhanced the reactivity of materials towards specific reactions, there is still much more room for improvement. In this work, the incorporation of electron-rich environments into the structure of nanocatalysts is proposed as a new approach for the enhancement of the <b>catalytic</b> activity of <b>nanomaterials.</b> This study is conducted in its entirety using computational quantum-based simulations. The effect of electron-rich regions on activation barriers for the dissociation of diatomic molecules is studied using metallic slit-type pores, finding that electron-rich environments enhance the reactivity of nanomaterials by reducing activation barriers required for the dissociation of molecules. The influence of electronic and geometric effects in the pores is also evaluated. It is found that local geometric characteristics, such as stacking planes forming the pore, and the presence of step-like defects influence adsorption energies and barriers for dissociation of molecules. Additionally, electrons inside the metallic pores have energies close to the Fermi-energy of the metal surfaces, which may allow tuning their energies for interactions with LUMO anti-bonding orbitals of specific molecules. Subsequently, electron-rich regions are incorporated into a 3 D nanostructured material (Pt 22 /NPG). This proposed catalyst shows enhanced reactivity towards the dissociation of gas-phase molecules. Additionally, Pt 22 /NPG may display enhanced reactivity, even when electron-rich regions do not interact with the molecules of interest, due to the good dispersion of Pt-clusters. Therefore, the incorporation of electron-rich environments into nanocatalysts is shown to be an efficient approach for the enhancement of the <b>catalytic</b> activity of <b>nanomaterials...</b>|$|R
30|$|A direct {{correlation}} between the surface composition of Au/Pt bimetallic nanoparticles and their catalytic activities has recently been established [1 – 4]. However, improving the <b>catalytic</b> activity in <b>nanomaterials</b> is a difficult task due to the complexity in controlling the surface composition. As a precise control over the nanoparticle surface arrangement is crucial to enhance catalytic activity, we have developed a simulation model to predict the metal arrangement in bimetallic nanoparticles prepared via the microemulsion route [5]. The model predictions were tested by comparison between experimental and simulation results [6]. Au/Pt nanoparticles were synthesized in a 75  % isooctane[*]/[*] 20  % tergitol[*]/[*] 5  % water microemulsion and the metal distribution was studied by HR-STEM (scanning transmission electron microscopy). Cross section with EDX analysis was performed to obtain their nanostructure. Theoretical STEM profiles were calculated from the structures predicted by simulation, using the same synthesis conditions as those of experimental studies. The successful agreement between calculated and experimental STEM profiles showed that the model is a promising tool for designing the synthesis of bimetallic nanoparticles with ad hoc controlled nanostructures.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to size {{and type of}} material (composition), shape or morphology of a nanomaterial is another important characteristic feature at nanoscale level. However, only few investigations are focusing on the biomedical or toxicological relationship associated with this parameter alone. Nevertheless, in metallic nanomaterials various properties including electromagnetic, optical and catalytic properties are strongly influenced by their shapes [72 – 75]; consequently, {{it is believed that}} along with size of the nanoparticles, shape of nanomaterial also has substantial potential to influence nano-bio interfaces. In {{addition to}} leading cellular uptake, size of a material is key element that is related with the surface area for a specific mass-dosage. Generally, to the overall surface area, contribution of shape of the nanomaterials will be significant. For instance, an octagonal shaped nanomaterial will have different surface area compare to spheres of the equivalent size. Since surface atoms have a tendency to hold unsatisfied high energy bonds, the higher <b>catalytic</b> activity of <b>nanomaterial</b> with larger surface areas enhances its reactivity. Therefore, after effective entry within the cellular milieu these nanomaterials will have better probabilities compared to counterpart micron-sized particles to intermingle with biomolecules of cells, triggering direct cellular destruction and promoting oxidative stress [43, 76].|$|R
40|$|Introduction We here {{present a}} new class of carbon-silica {{composite}} materials (CSM) with tunable bimodal porosity obtained by the synthesis of nano-sized graphitic crystallites inside the mesopores of a silica template. Besides the synthesis, their use in heterogeneous catalytic reactions will be highlighted in particular with emphasis on the valorisation of sugars to lactates. This value-added biomass conversion requires multiple catalytic functions and ideally demonstrates the versatility and tunability of this new class of composite materials. Experimental Section First, micelle-templated spherical Si-MCM- 41 particles are synthesized according to a modified Stöber method 1. Lewis acidic Sn is then incorporated via grafting and subsequent calcination in air. This mesoporous silica is impregnated with a furfurylalcohol solution and transferred into a quarts flow reactor. The organic precursor is polymerized and pyrolyzed under He at temperatures ranging from 673 to 1173 K. Post-synthesis oxidation of the carbon component is done at 573 K under oxygen flow. The material was fully characterized using XRD, pyridine-adsorption-IR, TPD, ICP-OES, TGA, XPS, 31 P-NMR and N 2 -physisorption. Catalytic tests with sugars were conducted in batch in alcoholic media. Results and Discussion Interestingly, the porosity characteristics of the CSM are readily controlled by the pyrolysis conditions and the amount of carbon precursor. The porous materials can be tuned from microporous over biporous to mesoporous composites. While past research by molecular probing techniques already demonstrated the shape selective properties of CSMs, we here focus on its usage in catalysis. The true unique advantage of this composite is the ability to introduce and tune various types of catalytic active functions independently onto both composing parts. The CSMs here described are bifunctional: weak Brønsted acidity arrives from oxygen built into the carbon (e. g. COOH) while Lewis acidic Sn is grafted on the silica surface. A schematic of the catalyst can be seen in figure 1. The synthesis of alkyllactates or lactic acid from sugars is an important biomass route towards valuable industrial products. Short chain alkyllactates are considered green solvents, and long chain esters are used in health care and cosmetics. The reaction mechanism starting from sucrose, C 6 or C 3 -sugars is shown in figure. Starting from dihydroxyaceton, the first step can be both Lewis or Brønsted acid catalyzed, while the second one needs Lewis acidity for selectivity towards alkyllactates. Strong Brønsted acidity will imply acetal formation. The alcoholic solvent determines the alkylchain of the formed ester. In earlier work, the dihydroxyaceton conversion was proven to work with zeolites containing extra framework Lewis Al. It is however difficult to tune Lewis and Brønsted acidity separately with zeolites and the selectivity and activity were therefore quite low. Hencefore, the bifunctional CSMs with weak proton acidity were designed. Table 1 summarizes some catalytic results. Nafion, a strong Brønsted acid catalyst, shows high conversion but low selectivity to lactates. The bare Sn-MCM- 41 (entry 2), displays low conversion and high selectivity. By introducing carbon with weak Brønsted acid oxygen functionalities in the mesopores of the silica, the conversion can be boosted, while the selectivity remains good. Entry 3 to 6 have been synthesized with an increasing carbon amount. Its effect is clear from the conversion. Entries 4, 7, 8 and 9 show CSMs synthesized at different pyrolysis temperatures. This determines the nature of the carbon. Pyrolyzed at 673 K, the carbon is rather poly-aromatic, with non-acidic oxygen groups and therefore low lactate yields are achieved. Pyrolyzing at 1173 K again gives a drop in conversion. The carbon here is more graphitic with less oxygen defects (evidenced with TPD) and more steric constraints. A simple oxidation procedure for introducing more oxygen defects and thus acid groups can further enhance the conversion to almost a 100 % (entry 10). This catalytic activity is the highest reported to date for this reaction. The catalytic trends can be linked to the characterization of the acid sites and the carbon. These catalysts also perform well in long chain alcoholic media or starting directly from C 6 sugars. An extra retro-aldol (and isomerization) is needed but up to 40 % yield of methyllactate could be obtained straight from sucrose at 433 K in methanol. In conclusion, {{a new class}} of porous carbon-silica materials is addressed with easily adaptable pore architecture of benefit in catalytic reactions. The new material allows for an easy introduction of different active sites especially useful for one-pot <b>multifunctional</b> <b>catalytic</b> approaches such as the conversion of sugars to lactates. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Catalytic</b> and {{energetic}} <b>nanomaterials</b> are analyzed chemically and structurally in atomistic detail. Examination of the prototypical industrial catalyst Pt catalysts supported on γ-Al 2 O 3 using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and scanning {{transmission electron microscopy}} (STEM) revealed non-bulk-like behavior. Anomalous, temperature-dependent structural dynamics were characterized in the form of negative thermal expansion (NTE) and abnormal levels of disorder. To examine a less complex system, electrocatalytically-active, core-shell nanostructures assembled from Pt and Pd were synthesized and subsequently examined using spherical aberration-corrected STEM (Cs-STEM) and high-energy X-ray diffraction (XRD). Atomically resolved micrographs provide significant insight into the differences in crystallinity and metal-atom bonding between Pt and Pd. The apparent structural dichotomy between Pt and Pd was extended to studying the differences in nanostructure between other third row fcc transition metals (3 M – Ir, Pt, and Au) and their second row counterparts (2 M – Rh, Pd, and Ag). With the use of Cs-STEM and atomic pair distribution function (PDF) measurements it was determined that the Au, Pt and Ir nanocrystals were more crystalline than their Ag, Pd and Rh analogues and that the 3 M series was capable of imparting its crystal structure onto the atoms from the 2 M series. Lastly, we looked at highly-reactive Al crystals and their successive passivation by secondary transition metals (Cu, Ni, Ag, Pd, Au and Pt). Rather than affording a uniform, monolayer coverage, Cs-STEM, XRD and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy revealed unalloyed, particulate deposits of the secondary metal on the Al...|$|R
