From this catch, American Seafoods {{produces}} whole fillet blocks, surimi {{made from}} whole fillets {{and also from}} flesh recovered during processing, roe, minced pollock blocks, fish oil, white fish meal, and other “sidestream” products such as stomachs, bone meal, fish skins, and milt.Pacific (whiting) hake are caught and produced into Pin Bone Out (PBO), Deep Skinned (DS), and Pin Bone In (PBI) whole fillet blocks as well as surimi, headed and gutted fish, <b>minced</b> <b>blocks,</b> white fish meal, and fish oil.

40|$|Silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix is {{contributing}} {{significantly to the}} total production of fish through aquaculture in Bangladesh. However, its low market price has become a serious concern to the fish farmers. The suitability of silver carp mince {{for the production of}} various value-added products (VAPs) - surimi, fish sausage, fish burger and fish stick was studied during April-September 2000 to ensure more appropriate and profitable utilization of silver carp. Surimi/frozen <b>mince</b> <b>block</b> was produced by washing the silver carp mince with 0. 1 % NaCl for 7 - 8 min (4 - 5 min agitation and 3 - 4 min settling). A two-step heating schedule for incubation at 50 °C for 2 h and cooking at 95 °C for 30 min gave high textured good quality consumer product. With the addition of cryoprotectants, surimi could be kept frozen for 5 months without loosing [sic] much of its textural and sensory qualities. Mince-mix and a batter with different ingredients and spices were formulated to produce fish burger using potato smash as the binding agent. Fish flake-mix and a batter with different ingredients and spices were formulated to prepare fish stick using both potato starch and potato smash as filler ingredients. Unwashed and washed frozen <b>mince</b> <b>block</b> or fresh flesh of silver carp was used to prepare fish sausage by heating at 100 °C for 1 h after incubating at 50 °C for 2 h. A spice-mix formulated with various local spices at the rate of 1. 0 - 1. 2 % gave good texture and flavor to the sausage. A good-appeared sausage-pink color was developed by combining three food-grade colors of asthaxanthin. Products prepared with potato starch, potato smash and rice smash had an acceptable bacterial load in refrigeration (5 °C) for up to 8 days and in room temperature (28 °C) for up to 3 days. No coliform bacteria were found in the products prepared...|$|R
40|$|Cost-profit {{analysis}} and market testing of some value-added products from silver carp such as fish <b>mince</b> <b>block,</b> fish sausage, fish ball, fish stick and fish burger were analyzed during April 2001 to March 2002. The study also explored {{the possibility to}} involve rural low-income people in the production and marketing of such products. The production of silver carp was higher in greater Jessore and Mymensingh districts but the price remained low during the peak-harvesting season in October to November. The price varied with size of the fish, season, market characteristics and effective demand of the buyers. Price of about 500 g size fish {{was found to be}} Tk. 20 - 25 /kg in the rural markets. The average size of fish in the rural markets was 3 S 0 - 550 g while that in the urban markets it was 700 - 1, 200 g. The cost of production of the value added products and profit margin were assessed on the basis of market price of the raw material {{as well as that of}} the finished products, transportation, storage and marketing costs. The profit margins of 34 %, 39 %, 81 % and 31 % of their sales price were obtained for fish sausage, fish ball, fish stick and fish burger, respectively. Actual production cost could be minimized if the fish is purchased directly from the farmers. Consumer's acceptance and marketability tests showed that both rural and urban people preferred fish ball than fish sausage. However, response towards the taste, flavor and color of fish ball and fish sausage was found to vary with occupations and age of the consumers. A correlation was observed between age group and acceptance of new products. Fish ball, fish stick and fish burger were found to be the most preferable items to the farmers because of easy formulation process with common utensils. Good marketing linkage and requirement of capital had been identified as the prerequisites for operating small-scale business on value-added fish products...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} set the {{temperature}} for the suitable still-air-thawing, the periods of time required for thawing at various ambient temperatures on <b>minced</b> ordinary muscle <b>block</b> of frozen jackmackerel and the changes of freshness in its of thawed one were determined. The K-value as an index of freshness was estimated with concave gradient elution method. The results were as follows: 1. The time required for thawing was affected considerably by the time during which temperature rise from - 5 to - 1 °C (Zone of maximimum ice crystal thawing), and it was decided by {{the discrepancy between the}} initial temperature of frozen fish muscle and the temperature of ambient air. The higher is the temperature of ambient air, the shorter is the thawing time, but the effect of higher thawing-temperature on the thawing time was not significant. 2. When the frozen fish muscle was thawed at various temperatures, changes in increase-ratio of K-value in the fish muscle showed the lowest value at about 15 °C in air. 3. The thawing temperature at which the total increment-K-value, obtained as the multiplication of K-value-increment-rate and thawing-time, shows the lowest value was ascertained to be 10 ~ 15 °C. 4. When the temperature of fish muscle at the centre of block after thawing reached its freezing point, the quality of the thawed fish muscle was better than that of the one under the temperature reaching 0 °C. 5. Accordingly, it was assumed that the thawing was to be done at 15 °C in the still-air, and at same time the temperature of fish muscle at centre on thawing should not be above its freezing point (about - 2 °C) ...|$|R
