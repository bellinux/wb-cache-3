500|$|Historically in Lancashire, {{during much}} of the 19th century Stretford was an {{agricultural}} village, with its own market, known locally as Porkhampton, a reference to the large number of pigs produced for the nearby Manchester market. It was also an extensive <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> <b>area,</b> producing more than [...] of vegetables each week for sale in Manchester by 1845. The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the subsequent development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town, accelerated the industrialisation that had begun in the late 19th century.

50|$|Relying on {{cities for}} markets, however, can have drawbacks. For example, in England, south Sussex {{was famous for}} growing {{tomatoes}} for the London market that were delivered by train. The arrival of railways in the 19th century at first stimulated growth of <b>market</b> <b>gardens</b> in certain <b>areas</b> by providing quick access to the city, but it eventually allowed commuting residents to move there and turn many <b>market</b> <b>garden</b> <b>areas</b> into suburbs. Urban sprawl still eats up farmland in urban regions. Buying the rights to develop farmland from the farmers solved this problem in Suffolk County, New York.|$|R
50|$|During its {{formative}} years, Preston {{was heavily}} reliant on {{an abundance of}} fertile land for farming, dairying and <b>market</b> <b>gardens.</b> <b>Areas</b> that were not productive however, yielded clay for pottery and bricks. The 1860s saw the development of Preston's industrial capacity, with a bacon-curing factory opening in 1862, followed by a tannery in 1865. These original establishments would be followed by several larger factories, including Huttons Hams and Bacons and Zwar's Parkside Tannery.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} written while {{the author was}} Director of Banksia Heritage + Archaeology] One of the {{characteristic}} features of modern Australia has been its transformation from essentially mono-cultural to genuinely multicultural. Migration and integration into the Australian social and economic system is, for most non-English speaking migrants, a multigenerational process, which generally includes becoming {{part of a large}} pool of labour for certain industries where lack of English language skills is not a hindrance. Market gardening has traditionally been one of these industries. This paper looks at one particular <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> <b>area</b> and how the material evidence of its history has almost disappeared as a result of development. The paper raises issues of sustainability in heritage conservation and the problems of dealing with multi-ethnic heritage. The case study for this paper is Warriewood on Sydney’s northern beaches, and parts of adjoining suburbs of Ingleside, Elanora Heights and Mona Vale. The Warriewood Valley was for about 60 years the centre of one of the major glasshouse tomato production areas in Sydney, and was notable for its glasshouses, which gave it the name of ‘Crystal Valley’. The start of glasshouse production represented a particular technological development, which is discussed further below. The work was carried out by a number of different ethnic groups, although Yugoslavs predominated. However, by the 1990 s the industr...|$|E

When the area was subdivided by real estate entrepreneur James Morrison in 1897 he used the name Spearwood Gardens Estate, the first time the name was used. The Spearwood area soon became one of Perth's major <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R

He bought the freehold of these properties in 1799. He also bought Earls Court Lodge which became the Gunters’ family home for 60 years. By 1799 he had also become sole proprietor of Gunter's Tea Shop which {{became one of the most}} fashionable Mayfair meeting places. Earls Court Lodge became nicknamed [...] "Currant-Jelly Hall".|$|R

5|$|German {{casualty}} {{figures are}} less complete {{than those of}} the Allies, and official figures have never been released. A signal possibly sent by II SS Panzer Corps on 27 September listed 3,300 casualties (1,300 killed and 2,000 injured) around Arnhem and Oosterbeek. Robert Kershaw's assessment of the incomplete records identified at least 2,500 casualties. In the Roll of Honour: Battle of Arnhem 17–26 September 1944, J.A. Hey of the Society of Friends of the Airborne Museum, Oosterbeek identified 1,725 German dead from the Arnhem area relating to the time of the battle. All of these figures are significantly higher than Model's conservative estimate of 3,300 casualties for the entire <b>Market</b> <b>Garden</b> <b>area</b> of battle (which included Eindhoven and Nijmegen).|$|R

The Farm also provides educational services to disadvantaged young people and adults with learning difficulties. The animals farmed include Dexter cattle, sheep (Whitefaced Woodland Ryeland), alpacas, goats, several breeds of pig, chickens and ducks. There are also two donkeys.

50|$|The {{low profile}} of the Chinese {{community}} in the decades following 1949 led some commentators to believe that assimilation was inevitable. In 1955 when the Glebe joss house was reopened after a fire, the Sydney Morning Herald observed {{that this might be}} the last such ceremony ever seen in Sydney. The lack of vitality of Chinatown was seen as further proof. But this was in part a result of the Chinese doing what everyone else was doing, deserting the city for the suburbs. There were pockets of Chinese in the western suburbs of Concord and Ashfield, in Kensington and Kingsford to the east and in Chatswood on the lower north shore. All of these places had some links to earlier Chinese settlements, often to older <b>market</b> <b>garden</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R

This plant treats class C recycled water to class A standard which means this water is suitable for {{a greater number of}} uses. In 2010/11, about 29,972 million litres of recycled water was supplied from the Western Treatment plant. Of this, about 28,051 million litres of recycled water (mostly Class C) was used to irrigate 85 km2 of pasture for grazing 15,000 cattle and 40,000 sheep and manage soil salinity onsite, and to maintain the health of the Ramsar listed wetlands. A further 1921 million litres of recycled water (Class A) was supplied to Southern Rural Water and City West Water for offsite customers, such as the Werribee <b>market</b> <b>garden</b> <b>area</b> to grow vegetables, and to local councils to irrigate sports grounds, parks and gardens.|$|R

40|$|The agrarian system Analysis and Diagnosis is {{used for}} this study, the goal of which {{was to provide a}} corpus of basic {{knowledge}} and elements of reflection necessary for the understanding the Niayes farming systems dynamics in Senegal, West Africa. Such holistic work has never been done before for this small region that provides the majority of vegetables in the area, thanks to its microclimate and access to fresh water in an arid country. Reading of the landscape and historical interviews coupled with fine-tuned household surveys were used to build a typology of agricultural production units (each type being represented by a production system). The main phases within the region’s history were distinguished. Before colonization, agriculture was based on gathering and shifting agriculture (millet and peanut) in the southern region and transhumant stockbreeding in the North. During colonization, <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> became a source of income as a response to cities’ increasing demand. Two major droughts (in the 1970 s and 1980 s) have accelerated this movement. Extension of <b>market</b> <b>gardening</b> <b>areas</b> and intensification of activities were made possible by Sahelian migrants’ influx and the creation of mbeye seddo, a contract that allows for sharing added value between the employer and seasonal workers, named sourghas. Over the past 20 years, the “race for motorization” has created important social gaps (added value sharing deserves review) and a risk of overexploitation of groundwater...|$|R

His methods centre on using compost as a mulch, rather than unrotted organic matter which tends to accumulate slugs in the damp, British climate. He encourages gardeners to be adaptable in their approach, according to local soil, conditions and crops grown. His own speciality is salad leaves for sale to local outlets and the plants grow well in undisturbed soil.|$|R
