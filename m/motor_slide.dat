The purpose of the work: the increase in efficiency of the drilling works {{on the base of}} matching the powers of the asynchronous motor and synchro-generator of DES at the load fluctuation. The mathematical model of the combined operation of the synchro-generator and asynchronous electric drive has been created, and the analytical dependencies on matching the powers of DES and electric drive have been obtained. The recommendations on selection of the DES power for the asynchronous drive depending on the drilling unit type and the drive power have been developed, and the methods for determination of asynchronous <b>motor</b> <b>slide</b> have been developed depending on the character and the value of the equipment defects. The methods and recommendations on the combined operation of the generator and motor have been introduced in the study process. The right selection of the power and type of DES allows to reduce the energy consumption required for the drilling works, and to optimize the asynchronous electric drive operation modes.

40|$|Assembly and {{stability}} of mitotic spindle is governed by the interplay of various intra-cellular forces, e. g. the forces generated by <b>motor</b> proteins by <b>sliding</b> overlapping anti-parallel microtubules (MTs) polymerized from the opposite centrosomes, the interaction of kinetochores with MTs, and the interaction of MTs with the chromosomes arms. We study the mechanical behavior {{and stability}} of spindle assembly {{within the framework of}} a minimal model which includes all these effects. For this model, we derive a closed [...] form analytical expression for the force acting between the centrosomes as a function of their separation distance and we show that an effective potential can be associated with the interactions at play. We obtain the stability diagram of spindle formation in terms of parameters characterizing the strength of <b>motor</b> <b>sliding,</b> repulsive forces generated by polymerizing MTs, and the forces arising out of interaction of MTs with kinetochores. The stability diagram helps in quantifying the relative effects of the different interactions and elucidates the role of motor proteins in formation and inhibition of spindle structures during mitotic cell division. We also predict a regime of bistability for certain parameter range, wherein the spindle structure can be stable for two different finite separation distances between centrosomes. This occurrence of bistability also suggests mechanical versatility of such self-assembled spindle structures. Comment: 7 pages, 6 figures, under review in EP...|$|R

40|$|In the {{actomyosin}} <b>motor,</b> myosin <b>slides</b> {{along an}} actin filament {{that has a}} helical structure with a pitch of ≈ 72 nm. Whether myosin precisely follows this helical track is an unanswered question bearing directly on the motor mechanism. Here, axial rotation of actin filaments sliding over myosin molecules fixed on a glass surface was visualized through fluorescence polarization imaging of individual tetramethylrhodamine fluorophores sparsely bound to the filaments. The filaments underwent one revolution per sliding distance of ≈ 1 μm, which {{is much greater than}} the 72 nm pitch. Thus, myosin does not “walk” on the helical array of actin protomers; rather it “runs,” skipping many protomers. Possible mechanisms involving sequential interaction of myosin with successive actin protomers are ruled out at least for the preparation described here in which the actin filaments ran rather slowly compared with other in vitro systems. The result also indicates that each “kick” of myosin is primarily along the axis of the actin filament. The successful, real-time observation of the changes in the orientation of a single fluorophore opens the possibility of detecting a conformational change(s) of a single protein molecule at the moment it functions...|$|R

40|$|Short {{regions of}} overlap between ends of {{antiparallel}} microtubules are central elements within bipolar microtubule arrays. Although their formation requires motors 1, recent {{in vitro studies}} demonstrated that stable overlaps cannot be generated by molecular motors alone. <b>Motors</b> either <b>slide</b> microtubules along each other until complete separation 2, 3, 4 or, {{in the presence of}} opposing motors, generate oscillatory movements 5, 6, 7. Here, we show that Ase 1, a member of the conserved MAP 65 /PRC 1 family of microtubule-bundling proteins, enables the formation of stable antiparallel overlaps through adaptive braking of Kinesin- 14 -driven microtubule–microtubule sliding. As overlapping microtubules start to slide apart, Ase 1 molecules become compacted in the shrinking overlap and the sliding velocity gradually decreases in a dose-dependent manner. Compaction is driven by moving microtubule ends that act as barriers to Ase 1 diffusion. Quantitative modelling showed that the molecular off-rate of Ase 1 is sufficiently low to enable persistent overlap stabilization over tens of minutes. The finding of adaptive braking demonstrates that sliding can be slowed down locally to stabilize overlaps at the centre of bipolar arrays, whereas sliding proceeds elsewhere to enable network self-organization...|$|R
