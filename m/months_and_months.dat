25|$|In 1982, Kiss {{asked for}} Wendy and the Plasmatics {{to appear as}} a special guest on their tour. Kiss wanted the {{controversial}} street edge that Wendy would bring {{as part of their}} tour and for the Plasmatics it was a chance to play in front of different audiences in different markets than they would ordinarily play. By the end of the tour with KISS it was clear that, although the formal notice that Capitol would not pick up their option for a second album did not come in for six months, the relationship with Capitol was done. It had taken <b>months</b> <b>and</b> <b>months</b> for the deal to be done, months to record and release the album and now months {{to get out of the}} deal. Gene Simmons approached Wendy and Rod about producing the next Wendy O. Williams album. So as to avoid any wasted time in legal issues with Capitol Records, it was decided not to use the Plasmatics name on the record at all and was simply called WOW, the initials for Wendy O. Williams. Gene Simmons felt it would give him the freedom he wanted to add more new players to the album.|$|E

The result showed that Exchange rate and Inflation have significant influence on stock return in the 3 <b>months,</b> 6 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> 12 <b>months</b> interval period. PBV has significant influence on stock return in the 3 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> 12 <b>months</b> interval period <b>and</b> ROA has significant influence on stock return only in the 3 months interval period.

40|$|BackgroundTo {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} both timing and dose of rehabilitation delivery on the functional recovery of stroke patients. MethodsFrom chart review, we included 76 patients who were admitted to a regional hospital for first-ever stroke, and who had received multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs including physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) at the inpatient department, and continuous rehabilitation therapy at the outpatient department for at least 3 months. The collected data included age, sex, type of stroke (hemorrhage/infarction), onset of stroke, initial motor status by Brunnstrom's motor recovery stages, time to rehabilitation intervention (from onset of stroke), length of stay, existence of aphasia, craniotomy (yes/no), and total units of rehabilitation. Main outcome measures were serial Barthel Index (BI) at initial assessment, 1 month, 3 <b>months,</b> 6 <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> 1 year post-stroke. ResultsAge was inversely correlated with BI and BI improvement at 3 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>months</b> post-stroke. Rehabilitation intervention time from onset was negatively correlated with BI improvement at 1 <b>month</b> <b>and</b> 1 year, and with BI at 1 month, 3 <b>months,</b> 6 <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> 1 year post-stroke. The total units of inpatient PT and/or OT were positively correlated with BI improvement at 1 <b>month,</b> 3 <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>months</b> post-stroke. The total units of PT and/or OT were positively correlated with BI improvement at 3 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>months</b> post-stroke. <b>And</b> the initial BI {{was positively correlated with}} BI at 1 <b>month,</b> 3 <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>months</b> post-stroke. The total units of OT can significantly predict BI improvement at 3 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>months</b> post-stroke, while the initial BI capacity can significantly predict BI status at 1 <b>month,</b> 3 <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>months</b> post-stroke. ConclusionThere is a dose-dependent effect of rehabilitation on functional improvement of stroke patients for the first 6 <b>months</b> post-stroke, <b>and</b> earlier delivery of rehabilitation has lasting effects on the functional recovery of stroke patients up to 1 year...|$|R

Bevin declared that Heiner's alleged connection to the Comer accusations had [...] "disqualified [...] from being the GOP nominee for governor". During a debate featuring all four Republican candidates on Kentucky Sports Radio, Bevin said, [...] "I don't know if [...] behind the Comer story, but I'm telling you his people have been pushing {{this for a long}} time.

2500|$|Goddard {{said that}} {{although}} the album came together easily, the band had difficulty creating [...] "Hand Me Down Your Love" [...] because [...] "it {{was just a matter}} of <b>months</b> <b>and</b> <b>months</b> of adding synthesizers, [...] adding drum parts", which resulted in [...] "something like 160 tracks or pieces of music". As well as this, the band needed to edit out sections that they felt were unnecessary. Goddard discussed the element of time and stated that because the band had more time to create the album, they [...] "tried things out differently" [...] which was ultimately [...] "a little bit unhelpful" [...] due to the number of recorded parts that were never used. Goddard said the band wanted to move away from synths and minimised their presence by making them more subtle. Although the band wanted the album to be a pop record and present [...] "a unified front", Al Doyle stated that the band did not want to lose the [...] "experimental element that [...] had before". To achieve this the band used a broader range of instruments, including a flugelhorn and steelpans in combination with synths and drum machines, as well as a guitar, a drum kit and a piano. Doyle said it was [...] "quite exciting for [...] to work with that palette of instruments". Whilst the band wanted to create an album that was more cohesive, Taylor said that they did not [...] "try to make it all sound like [...] from the same record". The cohesiveness and unity of the album was a by-product of the way the band spent their time crafting it: ...|$|E
