A <b>micro-entity</b> {{includes}} an independent inventor with a previous calendar year gross income {{of less than}} 3 times the national median household income who has previously filed {{no more than four}} non-provisional patent applications, not including those the inventor was obligated to assign to an employer. A <b>micro-entity</b> also includes a university or an inventor under an obligation to assign the invention to a university. A <b>micro-entity</b> is entitled to a 75% reduction in many of the patent fees payable to the US Patent Office during prosecution of a US patent application. The patent office is expected to develop regulations to identify which fees will be eligible for the reduction and how joint inventors may qualify as a <b>micro-entity.</b>|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the Proposal of a Directive of the European Parliament {{amending}} Council Directive 78 / 660 /EEC on the annual accounts of certain types of companies (the Fourth Directive), as regards <b>micro-entities,</b> which proposes to exempt <b>micro-entities</b> {{on a voluntary basis}} from the scope of the Fourth Directive and thus to relieve them of the obligation to draw up annual accounts. The aim of the proposal is to reduce the administrative burden of European <b>micro-entities.</b> The proposal is examined in particular in terms of its potential impact on administrative costs of <b>micro-entities</b> in the Czech Republic, taking into account a specific implementation into the Czech legislation that would offer to the <b>micro-entities</b> the possibility to voluntarily choose among double entry bookkeeping and two alternatives: keeping tax records and keeping records of revenues with lump expenditures. The thesis then first examines the reasons for the creation of the proposal in the EU and on their basis finds its creation well-founded.

Moreover, based on constitutional similarities to classical equations of motion, a well-defined relativistic time-independent Schrodinger equation is derived, which is one of our main achievements in developing a micro-relativistic physics of PF theory.

40|$|Based on {{the novel}} view that a <b>micro-entity</b> could be {{considered}} as a particle associated with a field partaking of the energy of particle which are both described by deterministic causal equations of motion, we examine the success of our new theory in elucidating the underlying physics of the double-slit experiment. Here, we explain with clear details how each micro-particle scatters from one of the slits at a given time. After the scattering through one of the slits, the particle shares some of its energy with its surrounding field and a particle-field system is again formed which its motion is governed by a deterministic dynamics during its flight towards the detecting screen. The interference pattern is then explained by showing how the final location of each particle-field system at the time of reaching the detecting screen is distributed according to an angular distribution (equal to the what quantum theory predicts for the fringe effects in a two-slit experiment). The probabilistic nature of such a distribution can be explained by considering the variations of the kinetic energy of the particle-field system at different local situations.

Our law establishes that the annual turnover for <b>micro-entity</b> shall not exceed the amount of 60 million rubles, or USD 755. 6 thousands at the current exchange rate (which at 20. 01. 2016 is 79. 41 rubles/USD). For the category of small businesses, the ceiling of the cash proceeds must be in the range of 60 to 400 million rubles (in dollar terms from USD 0. 756 to USD 5. 037 million). Respectively for the medium enterprises criteria, revenue must be from 400 million to 1 billion rubles, or USD 5. 037 and USD 12. 259 million). The size of the business over 1 billion rubles should be classified as Large Businesses. According to the Federal law No. 209 financial data levels must be adjusted after five years of operations. All commercial organizations with less than 15 employees/ (inclusive) are classified as Micro Enterprises, and with 16 to 100 employees – to the category Small Enterprises. /Accordingly, medium-sized enterprises are organizations with 101 to 250 employees. Today, it is noted that in World’s practice, the criterion for the classification of enterprises to the relevant category is defined not by generated financial flows and assets of the enterprise, but by simple employ.

40|$|Abstract Smaller {{companies}} have less manpower then larger companies to manage administrative tasks. EU {{has made it}} possible for member states to reduce the accounting and audit requirements for small companies and Sweden introduced the option of voluntary audit from the fiscal year of 2011 for <b>micro-entities</b> that do not exceed the threshold values of 3 employees, 3 MSEK turnover and 1. 5 MSEK balance sheet total. The values are lower than in other countries with voluntary audit. Due to this, previous research on voluntary audit was conducted on larger companies than Swedish <b>micro-entities.</b> The determinant factors for voluntary audit are therefore different in these <b>micro-entities</b> than in SMEs. The purpose of our study is to find what the decision-makers in <b>micro-entities</b> perceive as their reason to retain or dismiss their auditor as it became voluntary. As a starting point, we theorize that some of the relevant factors in previous studies on voluntary audit in SMEs can also have significance for <b>micro-entities.</b> Furthermore, that the relationships between the auditor and client can affect the decision whether to keep the auditor or not, especially as the companies are small enough for the decision-maker to have regular contact with the auditor and the small size of Skellefteå where we conduct the interview study. Our sample is eleven <b>micro-entities</b> in Skellefteå, out of which three have retained their auditor and intend to keep them in the company, four who are registered with an auditor but will not have an auditor next year, three who dismissed their auditor as soon as possible and one who was started after the law came into action and had never had auditor nor accountant. The determining factor for voluntary audit is in all but one case the advice of the auditor or accountant. No other factor was found to have any effect of magnitude. Previous research in the area have found connections between factors such as debt level, firm size, separation of ownership and management, non-audit services, external demand for audited financial statements and net benefits of audit. As the <b>micro-entities</b> in our sample have little or no debt and no separation of ownership and management we found that these factors are irrelevant to the choice of voluntary audit in our sample. Most of the companies perceive these as factors that would be relevant in a larger company, however. It is the largest firms (by turnover) that have kept their auditor, but do not mention this as a determining factor. Almost all {{companies have}} non-audit services from the audit firm, which do not seem to affect the voluntary audit decision. Those who had or will dismiss their auditor see no additional benefits by having an auditor than by having an accountant, which is also supported by the fact that only two companies could mention any benefit with audit aside from external demands from the government or tax authority. All companies believe that there are external demands for audited financial statements, but this was not found to be a determining factor. Relationship factors such as trust, interdependence and service quality do not determine the choice for voluntary audit, but do determine if the companies asked the auditor or accountant for advice on retaining or dismissing their auditor. We found that the decision-makers in the <b>micro-entities</b> all asked the professional they have the best and closest relationship with if they should have voluntary audits, and as all auditors replied to continue with the audit whereas all accountants did not consider it as necessary, relationships can definitely be seen as a contributing, but not determining, factor for voluntary audit...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the problem of the {{accounting}} for non-profit <b>micro-entities.</b> Czech Accounting Act allows these entities to follow already abolished statements of this act. As a consequence, non-profit micro-entites can still use single-entry bookkeeping system. First part of the thesis clarifies the reason for non-existence of some kind of supranational accounting regulation for these entities and also shows how accounting principles differ among severeal countries. The outcome of this part is the explanation why Czech Republic is not bound in this field in any manner. Then the thesis discusses different ways of keeping evidence at non-profi <b>micro-entities</b> that can be possible in the czech law system (tax evidence, single-entry bookkeeping system, simplified double-entry bookkeping system). Pros and cons of all mentioned systems are shown. Also the thesis explains how this non-standard state occured and how it developed in the time. The main result of the thesis (after analysing results of own empirical research) is the opinion that althought current state is not systematic, it serves well enough. Therefore {{there is no reason to}} make changes.

Askingthis question we must try to give an answer without ignoring the opinion of those who act in in thisshow. At European level, the legitimacy to develop standards specific to SME is contested. However, this global accounting standard may represents a very significant step on the path toglobal convergence of financial reporting practices by SMEs. It will contribute to enhancing thequality and comparability of SME financial statements around the world and assist SMEs ingaining access to finance.

The differences which can be noticed with certain (primarily socio-economic) characteristics, due to the proportionally small participation of refugee persons {{in relation to the}} total (domicile) population, could not significantly influence the total demographic, socio-economic and other characteristics of the population of central Serbia and Vojvodina. The most significant contribution of refugee (classifying the refugee corpus in the country's total population) is reflected in the mitigation of the depopulation trend, namely population growth, not only both <b>micro-entities,</b> but also lower administrative-territorial entities (districts) depending on the enumerated refugee population in them.

40|$|According to {{generally}} accepted accounting practice, {{the objective of}} financial statements is to provide useful information to the primary user groups of such statements, regardless {{of the size of}} the entity. The primary users of the financial statements of SMEs are the owners, South African Revenue Services (SARS) and bankers. The recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of full IFRSs do not result in cost-effective and useful information being provided to the users of the financial statements of SMEs (non-listed companies, close corporations and other small entities, irrespective of their legal form), because these users do not need the extensive and complex information provided in general purpose financial statements. Consequently, an accounting standard is required to differentiate between general and limited purpose financial statements. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued an exposure draft (ED 222) on IFRS for SMEs in February 2007. These stipulated modifications relating mainly to relaxed disclosure requirements and are more applicable to medium-sized entities. According to a survey among preparers of financial statements in June 2007, these developments may not be adequate for the purposes of smaller entities, irrespective of their legal form. Accordingly, the study recommends that a formal, separate set of simplified differential reporting standards be developed for smaller entities.

40|$|The {{development}} of biomaterials has recently {{focused on the}} design and synthesis of peptide-conjugated hydrogels {{that are capable of}} eliciting some specific responses to cell and tissue mediated by biomolecular recognition, which can be manipulated by altering design of the material. Biomolecular recognition of hydrogel materials by cells and tissue has been achieved by surface and bulk modification via chemical or physical methods, with bioactive molecules as short peptide sequences that can incur specific interactions with cell receptors or tissue binding-site. Peptides, indeed, are the smallest bioactive entities contained in a protein and they are responsible, in particular way, of full chemical interactions and spatial arrangement, which together supply the biological recognitions. Hydrogels, instead, represent one the most popular materials used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine for their versatile properties. Here, are reported the preparation of DVS-crosslinked hyaluronic acid-based hydrogels for tissue wound dressing applications and the synthesis of novel supramolecular PEI-based hydrogels as cell microenvironments for biomedical applications. In the first part, collagen type I binding fragment conjugated to microbeads of hyaluronic acid have shown non-covalent adhesive interactions on human derma and cornea of eye, after mechanical or photo-removal of epithelial tissues. Were evaluated microbeads adhesive properties on human derma and cornea of eye, and was observed that they formed a continuous covering layer from indiscriminately biological provenience of the collagen type I. This novel instructed biomaterial show abilities to cover damaged tissue only where was provoked the injury, as well as the final layer was originated by deformation of many <b>micro-entities</b> capable to arrange itself until to completely dress the injury regions. In second part, novel PEI hydrogels were synthesized, they showed easily chemical activation by multi-photon laser irradiation showing interesting three-dimensional patterning capabilities in presence of peptide as RGD and biomolecules with free carboxylic acid or hydroxyl groups without use of adjunctive photo-initiators or activators. PEI hydrogels activated for photo-conjugation can be indispensable to the spatial distribution control of bioactive signal, which represents an important factor for cell recognition and cell-guidance behaviour in tissue genesis and regeneration.
