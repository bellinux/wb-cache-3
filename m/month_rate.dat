[...] Because PACE programs enroll only the very frail and incapacitated, they are exactly the patient population for whom prevention and health promotion makes a difference. Most PACE patients have multiple diagnosis, with an average of over 7 diagnoses per member. Among the most common are cardiac problems, diabetes, hypertension, and vascular disease. PACE programs have strong incentives to help keep their members as healthy as possible—their patients, if left without care, are likely to require extensive acute and nursing home care, which are very expensive. So PACE programs tend to provide high levels of preventive services, such as very frequent check ups, exercise programs, dietary monitoring, programs to increase strength and balance, etc. [...] PACE programs organize their services in a [...] "PACE Center". These Centers tend to have a Day Health Center, physician' offices, nursing, social services and rehabilitation services, along with administrative staff, all in one site. Members attend centers from rarely to 7 days a week, depending on their care plans. Care planning is done with the member, his or her care team, and appropriate family members; most members attend about 2 days per week.|$|E

40|$|During the {{financial}} crisis of 2007 / 08 the level and volatility of interest rate spreads increased dramatically. This paper examines how {{the choice of the}} target interest rate for monetary policy affects the volatility of inflation, the output gap and the yield curve. We consider three monetary policy operating procedures with different target interest rates: a one-month market rate, a three-month market rate and an essentially riskless one-month repo rate. The implementation tool is the one-month repo rate for all three operating procedures. In a highly stylised model, we find that using a money market rate as a target rate generally yields lower variability of the macroeconomic variables. This holds under discretion as well as under commitment both in times of financial calm or turmoil. Whether the one month or three <b>month</b> <b>rate</b> procedure performs best depends on the maturity of the specific rate that enters the IS curve. optimal monetary policy rules, monetary operating procedures, yield curve...|$|E
40|$|The study {{presents}} a macro-finance model {{to analyze the}} impacts of a fiscal policy shock in the Brazilian term structure of interest rate in the period 1999 - 2010. Fiscal policy explains {{a higher proportion of}} the long-term interest rate variance (25 % of the five years rate) comparing to the short-term interest rate (13 % of the one month rate); while the monetary policy explains a higher proportion of the short-term variance (23 % of the one <b>month</b> <b>rate)</b> comparing to the long-term interest rate (6 % of the five years rate). Fiscal policy austerity, represented by an increase in the primary budget surplus, reduces interest rate in general, especially the long-term rate, while the monetary policy, represented by an increase in the SELIC rate increases especially the short-term rate. The results are robust regarding the observed variables choice, to the number of lags in the model, and to the identification hypothesis. The study suggests that fiscal policy re{{presents a}} large part of the evolution of the Brazilian term structure of interest rate, especially movements related to long-term rate, and indicates the limits of the Monetary Authority and the Central Bank in controlling interest rates and inflation, while contributes to the debate regarding the impact of fiscal shocks over interest rate...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt was {{hypothesized}} that in acute inferior wall myocardial infarction, an additional ischemic area in the subendocardium of the noninfarcting territory would produce a selective current dipole between the infarcting and ischemic regions. A resistance network model to calculate epicardial potentials from body surface electrocardiographic potentials was developed and {{used to examine the}} hypothesis in 219 patients with acute inferior myocardial infarction. In the learning set of 110 patients, two characteristic dipole patterns were observed, each associated with a high mortality rate in the ensuing 15 months when compared with that in the remaining patients. In the test set of 109 patients, a double-blind analysis of the patterns showed that the 34 patients with a dipole pattern had a collective mortality rate of 35 % at 15 months compared with a 15 <b>month</b> <b>rate</b> of 5 % in the remaining patients. In the total group of 219 patients, the magnitude of ST segment elevation and both the magnitude and integral of the area voltage of ST depression on the epicardium were significantly correlated with the mortality rate (p < 0. 0002 for all variables against death at 15 months). This study strongly suggests that ST depression due to ischemia can be differentiated from ST depression secondary to the ST elevation in acute inferior infarction by the examination of epicardial potential distributions...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} cases of two patients, {{previously}} operated for mitral mechanical valve replacement who developed thrombosis of the prosthesis. The two patients were successfully treated with pharmacological thrombolysis with no recurrence. One patient developed late peripheral embolization most probably due to late mobilisation of a thrombotic fragment. Our experience with surgical management is reported (39 mitral and 5 aortic prosthetic thrombosis from 1982 to 1999 among 89 patients with prosthetic malfunction). Average time interval between surgery and thrombus formation is 26 months (max 204, min 1 <b>month).</b> <b>Rate</b> of mitral thrombosis is 3. 9 % and aortic 0. 25 %. Clinical presentation spreads from almost asymptomatic patients to critically ill patients with pulmonary oedema or frank cardiogenic shock. Temporary suspension of anticoagulant therapy (83 % in our study group) to rule out minor surgery, {{appears to be the}} most frequent cause of thrombosis. Transthoracic or better transoesophageal echo-cardiography and Doppler are by far the most accurate diagnostic tools that can entirely replace angiographic assessment. Operative mortality was 64 % in the prosthetic mitral thrombosis and 20 % in the aortic one. Thrombolytic treatment may be affected by minor to relevant complications such as peripheral or central embolization but in our experience and according to the literature it seems much less hazardous than re-do surgery. Thrombolytic treatment is advocated for critical patients unless emergency institution of cardio pulmonary bypass is required and/or indicated.

The results indicate that for specimens cured under controlled laboratory conditions, inclusion of silica fume in the concrete mix reduces the 3 -year DS by 25 %, the induced shrinkage stress by 36 % and the first <b>month</b> <b>rate</b> of DS by 21 %. The corresponding reduction in the 3 -year DS, the induced shrinkage stress, and the first month's rate of DS for the counterpart specimens cured under hot-dry field conditions are 13 %, 26 %, and 24 %, respectively. The results also show that for specimens cured under laboratory conditions, replacing the superplasticizer by plasticizer increases the 3 -year DS by 21 %, the induced shrinkage stress by 27 %, and the first month's rate of DS by 32 %. The corresponding increase in the DS, the induced shrinkage stress, and the first month DS for the counterpart specimens cured under the hot-dry field conditions are 27 % and 34 %, and 35 %, respectively.

40|$|AbstractWe {{assess whether}} {{two classes of}} bubbles occur in the spot price of gold, {{rational}} speculative and periodically bursting bubbles, using gold's lease rates {{for the first time}} in the literature as a measure of its fundamental value. This question is of particular significance as these are the only observable market measures of a yield that can be earned from gold. We use unit root and cointegration tests to look for rational speculative bubbles and Markov Switching Augmented Dickey–Fuller tests for periodically bursting bubbles. ADF and cointegration tests point to a rational speculative bubble. The more theoretically valid Markov Switching ADF test gives mixed evidence. No bubble is found to be present if we allow the variance to switch between regimes, the gold and its lease rate relationship is instead characterised by high and low variance periods. Imposing a constant variance gives evidence of a bubble for the 2, 3 and 12 <b>month</b> lease <b>rates,</b> but no bubble when we use the 1 and 6 <b>month</b> <b>rates</b> as determinants...|$|R
