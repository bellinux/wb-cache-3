5|$|Throughout his life, Moser {{received}} {{a number of}} awards, including the Clusius Medal (Budapest 1978) and the Kardinal Innitzer Preis (Vienna 1985). In 1986, he was made {{a member of the}} Austrian Academy of Sciences. Having already been elected as an honorary member of the Ukrainian Botanical Society, he became a foreign member of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in 1992, the first mycologist to be elected. He was recognised by a number of <b>mycological</b> societies, including becoming an honorary member of the <b>Mycological</b> Society of America in 1987, and Centenary Fellow of the British <b>Mycological</b> Society in 1996. He also {{received a}}n honorary doctorate from the University of Lyon in 1984, and in 1990 was awarded honorary citizenship of Borgotaro, Italy.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} at the Garden, Rogerson was also a deeply {{involved}} member of the <b>Mycological</b> Society of America (MSA). He served as Managing editor (1958–89) and Editor-in-chief (1960–65) of the scientific journal Mycologia. He was Vice-President (1967), President Elect (1968), and President of the MSA (1969), and secretary-treasurer of the society from 1973 to 1974. He has served as historian of the <b>Mycological</b> Society of America from 1960 to 1990. Rogerson was a generous donor to MSA student travel awards. He died in Ogden on September 7, 2001.|$|E
5|$|Bulliard gave Boletus aereus {{the common}} name of le bolet bronzé (the bronze bolete) in 1789, noting {{that it was}} called the cep noir (black cep) in other countries. It is {{commonly}} known as ontto beltza (black fungus) in Basque, porcino nero (black piglet) in Italian, and Cèpe bronzé in French. In Greek it is known as vasilikό (the royal one), or kalogeraki (little monk). The English common name is dark cep, while the British <b>Mycological</b> Society also approved the name bronze bolete.|$|E
5|$|Clark T. Rogerson {{belongs to}} the Dudley <b>mycological</b> lineage, which {{can be traced back}} to Anton De Bary, a famous German mycologist. William Russell Dudley was Assistant Professor of Cryptogamic Botany at Cornell University from 1883 to 1892, and {{received}} <b>mycological</b> training from De Bary in 1887. Joseph Charles Arthur, George Francis Atkinson, and Mason B. Thomas studied under Dudley. Thomas went to Wabash College, where he would influence Harry Morton Fitzpatrick to study mycology. Fitzpatrick received his Ph.D. in 1913 at Cornell under tutelage of Atkinson. Rogerson studied under Fitzpatrick at Cornell from 1946 to 1950. Contemporary to Rogerson was fellow student Richard P. Korf, another prominent mycologist. Students of Rogerson include Robert L. Shaffer (Kansas State; M.A.), Susan Carey Canham (Columbia University; Ph.D.), Anna F. Doyle (Columbia University; Ph.D.), Gary J. Samuels (Columbia University; Ph.D.), and Rosalind Lowen (Lehman College; Ph.D.). Katia F. Rodrigues and Priscila Chaverri (Penn State; Ph.D.) studied under Samuels. The Rogerson sublineage continues to expand under Chaverri at the University of Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of his career, Moser {{collected}} over 25,000 <b>mycological</b> specimens. He first described around 420 Cortinarius species and around 80 other species, including both agarics and boletes. He circumscribed three new genera: Singeromyces (1966), Stephanopus (1975) and Anamika (2002). Much of his research covered four key areas: the taxonomy of Agaricales—including the classical morphotaxonomy and the chemotaxonomy of the order—the toxicity of the chemical constituents of members of the same order, and the ecology of ectomycorrhiza.|$|E
5|$|Zhu-Liang Yang and Tai-Hui Li {{discovered}} the species by reexamining various herbarium specimens of white Amanita typically {{referred to as}} either A.verna or A.virosa. They realized that collections referred to as these European species actually comprised three taxa new to science or the region. The holotype specimen of A.exitialis {{is located in the}} <b>Mycological</b> Herbarium of Guangdong Institute of Microbiology.|$|E
5|$|Clark Thomas Rogerson, (2 October 1918– 7 September 2001), was an American mycologist. He {{was known}} for his work in the Hypocreales (Ascomycota), {{particularly}} Hypomyces, a genus of fungi that parasitize other fungi. After receiving his doctorate from Cornell University in 1950, he went on to join the faculty of Kansas State University. In 1958, he became a curator at The New York Botanical Garden, and served as editor for various academic journals published by the Garden. Rogerson was involved with the <b>Mycological</b> Society of America, serving in various positions, including President in 1969. He was Managing Editor (1958–89) and Editor-in-chief (1960–65) of the scientific journal Mycologia.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} in {{the literature}} about whether Suillus cothurnatus represents a different species from S.salmonicolor. The online <b>mycological</b> taxonomy database MycoBank lists them as synonyms, contrary to Index Fungorum. In their 2000 monograph of North American boletes, Alan Bessette and colleagues list the two taxa separately, noting that the range of S.cothurnatus {{is difficult to determine}} because of confusion with S.salmonicolor. In a molecular analyses of Suillus phylogeny, based on the internal transcribed spacer, S.salmonicolor (as S.subluteus) and S.intermedius clustered together very closely, indicating a high degree of genetic similarity. These analyses were based on comparing the sequence differences in a single region of ribosomal DNA; more recent molecular analyses typically combine the analysis of several genes to increase the validity of inferences drawn.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Moser {{enrolled}} at the University of Innsbruck, taking classes in botany, zoology, geology, physics and chemistry. At this time, Austria was {{under the control of}} Nazi Germany and did not exist as an independent state. Moser became an authorised mushroom controller and instructor, and it was officially requested that he attend <b>mycological</b> seminars around Germany and Austria. At these seminars, he met a number of prominent mycologists, including Ernst Thirring. Thirring showed Moser some of the issues surrounding the large genus Cortinarius, which remained an interest {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1943, aged 19 and after only three terms at Innsbruck, his studies were interrupted so he could perform military service. Having shown earlier promise in languages, he was trained as an interpreter, then sent to the Balkan Peninsula. He continued to show an active interest in mycology, collecting and identifying mushrooms and reading Rolf Singer's Das System der Agaricales.|$|E
5|$|Due {{partly to}} their ready {{availability}} and {{the ease with}} which they may be grown in the laboratory, C.micaceus and other coprinoid mushrooms were common subjects in cytological studies of the 19th and 20th centuries. The German botanist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link reported his observations {{of the structure of the}} hymenium (the fertile spore-bearing surface) in 1809, but misinterpreted what he had seen. Link thought that microscopic structures known today as basidia were thecae, comparable in form to the asci of the Ascomycetes, and that each theca contained four series of spores. His inaccurate drawings of the hymenium of C.micaceus were copied in subsequent <b>mycological</b> publications by other authors, and it was not until microscopy had advanced that mycologists were able to determine the true nature of the basidia, when nearly three decades later in 1837 Joseph-Henri Léveillé and August Corda independently published correct descriptions of the structure of the hymenium. In 1924, A. H. Reginald Buller published a comprehensive description and analysis of the processes of spore production and release in the third volume of his Researches on Fungi.|$|E
5|$|Moser was {{promoted}} to Associate University Professor in 1964. Two years later, the Faculty of Science of the University of Innsbruck recommended that a chair of microbiology should be created at the Botanical Institute in Innsbruck. The Federal Ministry of Education accepted the recommendation. Moser was the only candidate for the position, and was unanimously named {{by a number of}} leading European botanists and mycologists for the post in 1967. Subsequently, in 1968, Moser {{was promoted}} to full professor, and, in 1972, Moser became the head of the newly established Institute of Microbiology, {{the first of its kind}} in Austria. He remained in charge of the Institute until his retirement. He taught on a wide range of subjects, including the taxonomy of fungi, ecology of fungi, mycogeography, bacteria, viruses, chemotaxonomy, molecular genetics, microbial toxicology, immunology and symbiosis. During his career at the university, he oversaw over 60 doctoral theses, in addition to a number of diploma theses. In 1970, Moser became the president of the Austrian <b>Mycological</b> Society, taking over after the death of the previous post-holder, Kurt Lohwag. Lohwag, in turn, had taken up the position after the death of his predecessor, Thirring, earlier that year. Moser remained the society's president for 21 years.|$|E
5|$|Thom was the U.S. Delegate to the 1905 International Dairy Congress held in Paris, France. He helped {{establish}} a graduate education {{program at the}} USDA. In 1907, he became a charter member of the Dairy Association of America, and in 1918, was appointed President of the Bacteriological Association of Washington. He attended the 1935 International Soil Congress in Oxford, England and was Vice President of the 1939 International Microbiological Congress in New York. He {{was a member of}} the National Academy of Sciences, a charter member of the <b>Mycological</b> Society of America, and president of the Society of American Bacteriologists in 1940 and the Society of Industrial Microbiology in 1950. Thom was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Science degree by Lake Forest College in 1936. For his work on penicillin, he and his research group received the Lasker Group Award in 1946, and the USDA Distinguished Service Award in 1947. The same year, he received a gold medal from the Spanish National Research Council for his contributions to microbiology and medicine.|$|E

25|$|The stalk (also {{called the}} stipe, or stem) may be central {{and support the}} cap in the middle, {{or it may be}} off-center and/or lateral, as in species of Pleurotus and Panus. In other mushrooms, a stalk may be absent, as in the polypores that form shelf-like brackets. Puffballs lack a stalk, but may have a {{supporting}} base. Other mushrooms, such as truffles, jellies, earthstars, and bird's nests, usually do not have stalks, and a specialized <b>mycological</b> vocabulary exists to describe their parts.|$|E
25|$|The Rev. Dr Badham {{was more}} {{successful}} as a mycologist, writing a well-received Treatise on the esculent funguses of England, published in 1847. He {{seems to have}} become interested in the subject {{as a result of}} visiting fungus markets in Italy. Eating wild fungi was considered an eccentric and dangerous pastime in England at the time and the book attracted some popular interest, if only as a curiosity. The original edition contained colour plates by the noted <b>mycological</b> illustrator Anna Maria Hussey. A second (posthumous) edition was published in 1863, edited by mycologist Frederick Currey.|$|E
25|$|Both Brown and Hazen {{received}} many awards for their collaborative work, {{the first major}} prize being the Squibb Award in Chemotherapy in 1955. Brown was also elected fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences in 1957. On Brown’s retirement in 1968, she received the Distinguished Service Award of the New York Department of Health. In 1972, she was also given the Rhoda Benham Award of the Medical <b>Mycological</b> Society of the Americas. Brown and Hazen were the first women ever to receive, in 1975, the American Institute of Chemists’ Chemical Pioneer Award.|$|E
25|$|Cortinarius badiolaevis {{was first}} {{described}} by Tuula Niskanen, Kare Liimatainen, Rafael Mahiques, Josep Ballarà and Ilkka Kytövuori in a 2011 {{article in the}} academic journal <b>Mycological</b> Progress, based on specimens found in the 1990s and 2000s in both Spain and Sweden. The specific name badiolaevis {{is derived from the}} Latin badius, meaning reddish-brown, and laevis, meaning smooth. The name is in reference to the characteristics of the cap. Based on phylogenetic analysis, C. badiolaevis is part of the subgenus Telamonia, the largest but most poorly known Cortinarius subgenus. The species is not part of any known sections, and lacks any close relatives.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, {{the sixteen}} natural history {{collections}} at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge were {{designated by the}} state legislature as the Louisiana Museum of Natural History. Together, these collections hold {{a total of more}} than 2.8 million specimens, objects, and artifacts that document the rich natural history of Louisiana. These collections are dispersed among six independently administered units on campus, and include the Vascular Plant Herbarium, the <b>Mycological</b> Herbarium, the Lichen Herbarium, the Louisiana State Arthropod Museum, the Palynology Collection, the Mineralogy and Petrology Collections, the Textile and Costume Museum, the Louisiana Geological Survey Log Library and Core Repository, and, within the LSU Museum of Natural Science, the Collection of Amphibians and Reptiles, the Collection of Birds, the Collection of Fishes, the Collection of Genetic Resources, the Collection of Mammals, the Vertebrate Paleontology Collection, the Collection of Microfossils and Invertebrates, and the Anthropological and Ethnological Collections.|$|E
25|$|The {{complete}} lifecycles {{of any of}} {{the species}} of Pneumocystis are not known, but presumably all resemble the others in the genus. The terminology follows zoological terms, rather than <b>mycological</b> terms, reflecting the initial misdetermination as a protozoan parasite. It is an extracellular parasite. All stages are found in lungs and because they cannot be cultured ex vivo, direct observation of living Pneumocystis is difficult. The trophozoite stage is thought to be equivalent to the so-called vegetative state of other species (such as Schizosaccharomyces pombe) which, like Pneumocystis, belong to the Taphrinomycotina branch of the fungal kingdom. The trophozoite stage is single-celled and appears amoeboid (multilobed) and closely associated with host cells. Globular cysts eventually form that have a thicker wall. Within these ascus-like cysts, eight spores form which are released through rupture of the cyst wall. The cysts often collapse forming crescent-shaped bodies visible in stained tissue. If meiosis takes place within the cysts, or what the genetic status is of the various cell types is not known for certain.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{recent survey}} work {{has shown that}} {{surviving}} waxcap grasslands are more extensive than in many other European countries, thanks mainly to large areas of unimproved upland sheep pastures and also to many unimproved lawns (especially in churchyards and country houses) and amenity grasslands. Nonetheless, five species characteristic of waxcap grasslands - Entoloma bloxamii, Hygrocybe calyptriformis, Hygrocybe spadicea, Geoglossum atropurpureum, and Microglossum olivaceum - are or {{have been the subject}} of national Biodiversity Action Plans and waxcap grasslands as a specific habitat are the subject of several local Biodiversity Action Plans. Waxcap grassland surveys have been undertaken by the British <b>Mycological</b> Society, the National Trust, Plantlife, and the various national conservation bodies. As a result, several waxcap grassland sites, such as the banks of Llanishen and Lisvane Reservoirs in Cardiff and the lawns of Roecliffe Manor in Leicestershire, have been designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest, affording them some legal protection. A leaflet on managing waxcap grasslands in Britain and Ireland has been published by Plantlife and the Fungus Conservation Forum.|$|E
500|$|Moser died on 30 September 2002. After {{returning}} from 7th International Congress in Oslo, Norway, {{he suffered a}} series of heart attacks. After being admitted to hospital, his condition rapidly declined before his death. Obituaries were published {{in a variety of}} academic journals, including <b>Mycological</b> Progress, <b>Mycological</b> Research, Sydowia, Österreichische Zeitschrift für Pilzkunde, and Berichte des Naturwissenschaftlichen-medizinischen Verein Innsbruck. Horak and colleagues, writing for the journal <b>Mycological</b> Research, described Moser's death as [...] "an irreplaceable loss to the international community of <b>mycological</b> science", and, writing in Sydowia, they said that the [...] "mycological world has lost one of its pillars of taxonomy for agarics and boletes.
