2500|$|Contesting {{grew out}} of other amateur radio {{activities}} in the 1920s and 1930s. [...] As intercontinental communications with amateur radio became more common, competitions were formed to challenge stations to make as many contacts as possible with amateur radio stations in other countries. [...] Contests were also formed to provide opportunities for amateur radio operators to practice their <b>message</b> <b>handling</b> skills, used for routine or emergency communications across long distances. [...] Over time, the number and variety of radio contests has increased, and many amateur radio operators today pursue the sport as their primary amateur radio activity.|$|E
2500|$|Sir Piers Robert Dick Lauder, 13th Baronet, born 3 October 1947 at Nicosia, Cyprus, {{where his}} father was an officer serving in the British Army. From 1974 until 2006, Lauder (who only uses the surname Lauder) was a {{programmer}} and [...] Computer Systems Officer in the Basser Department of Computer Science at Sydney University, New South Wales, Australia. His main interests are {{in the areas of}} networking and operating systems. With Judy Kay he co-authored the Fair Share Scheduler, now being sold by Aurema under the name [...] "ARMTechShareExpress". With Professor Robert (Bob) Kummerfeld he co-authored the <b>Message</b> <b>Handling</b> Systems network ("MHSnet") used, among others, by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Professor Kummerfeld and Piers Lauder were jointly elected to the Australian Internet Hall of Fame in 1998. Sir Piers Lauder is a founding member of AUUG, the Australian Unix and Open Systems User Group. He has twice been appointed Programme Chairman at AUUG Conferences in Sydney and has taken leave from the university to work overseas on three separate occasions, twice at the invitation of Bell Laboratories to work in the lab that originated UNIX, and once at the invitation of UUNET to work in the burgeoning ISP business. He is an enthusiastic proponent of the Python programming language. He has, by his partner Jane Elix, a natural child, Angus Thomas Lauder Elix (born 1996). They also have a foster-daughter, Akira Crease. [...] The heir presumptive to the baronetcy is Mark Andrew Dick Lauder (born 1951), second and youngest son of the 12th Baronet. [...] He was born in Berlin at the British Military Hospital. His heir apparent is his only son, Martin Dick-Lauder (born 1976).|$|E

5000|$|Compliance {{testing is}} the reason for the {{existence}} of game testing labs. First-party licensors for console platforms have strict technical requirements titles licensed for their platforms. For example, Sony publishes a Technical Requirements Checklist (TRC), Microsoft publishes Xbox Requirements (XR), and Nintendo publishes a set of [...] "guidelines" [...] (Lotcheck). Some of these requirements are highly technical and fall outside the scope of game testing. Other parts, most notably the formatting of standard error <b>messages,</b> <b>handling</b> of memory card data, and handling of legally trademarked and copyrighted material, are the responsibility of the game testers. Even a single violation in submission for license approval may have the game rejected, possibly incurring additional costs in further testing and resubmission. In addition, the delay may cause the title to miss an important launch window, potentially costing the publisher even larger sums of money.|$|R

However, {{there is a potential}} performance overhead that, for autonomous robotic and embedded systems, may be critical. Proposals for robotic middleware continue to emerge, but surprisingly, they repeatedly follow the publish-subscriber model.
