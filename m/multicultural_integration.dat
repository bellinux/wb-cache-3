[...] He said the manifestations of the controversy in Britain [...] "embodied an anger arising in part from the frustrations of the migrant experience and generally reflected failures of <b>multicultural</b> <b>integration,</b> both significant Rushdie themes. Clearly, Rushdie's interests centrally include explorations of how migration heightens one's awareness that perceptions of reality are relative and fragile, and of the nature of religious faith and revelation, not to mention the political manipulation of religion. Rushdie's own assumptions about the importance of literature parallel in the literal value accorded the written word in Islamic tradition to some degree. But Rushdie seems to have assumed that diverse communities and cultures share some degree of common moral ground on the basis of which dialogue can be pieced together, and it is perhaps for this reason that he underestimated the implacable nature of the hostility evoked by The Satanic Verses, even though a major theme of that novel is the dangerous nature of closed, absolutist belief systems." ...|$|E

50|$|Another {{challenge}} to multicultural education {{is that the}} extent of <b>multicultural</b> content <b>integration</b> in a given school tends {{to be related to}} the ethnic composition of the student body. That is, as Agirdag and colleagues have shown, teachers tend to incorporate more multicultural educational in schools with a higher share of ethnic minority students. However, there is no fundamental reason why only schools with ethnic minority pupils should focus on multicultural education. On the contrary, in particular there is a need for White students, who are largely separated from their ethnic minority peers in White-segregated schools, to become more familiar with ethnic diversity. While ethnic minority students learn in many contexts about the mainstream society in which they live, for White students the school context might be the only places where they can have meaningful encounters with ethnic and religious others.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to point out the {{problems}} of human rights education (HRE) by showing some approaches to analyse Japanese characteristics of HRE and by studying about where HRE in the relation to some relevant educational fields places, for example multicultural education or moral education. Approaches to the analysis about a placement of HRE are composed of two axes, "law" and "moral". The axis "law" consists of the orientation to universality and individualism (law-related education, moral education) and the orientation to cultural relativism and collectivism (<b>multicultural</b> education, <b>integration</b> education). On the other hand, the axis "moral" consists of the orientation to relationship and morality (moral education, integration education) and the orientation to diversity and differentiation (law-related education, multicultural education). HRE is oriented, from a point of international human rights, toward universality and individualism. However HRE is also related to collectivity and culture of minorities and is situated relatively in the center of the chart of two axes...|$|R
30|$|However, to {{conclude}} from this that interculturalism is not coercive (as {{opposed to the}} <b>multicultural</b> or civic <b>integration</b> paradigms) presupposes an unduly narrow conception of state coercion. Indeed, many things that the state and municipalities can do to promote contact is at least indirectly coercive. To promote contact within libraries, park, public squares and public markets and cultural festivals, governments, national or municipal, need funding that they get from mandatory taxation. Moreover, intercultural urban planning decisions are made to shape urban spaces in certain ways. Desirable and justifiable as this may be, such decisions impose one spatial configuration rather than another onto citizens who move through to the cities. Intercultural urban planning is not individualist libertarian laisser-faire.|$|R
40|$|The bulk of {{scholarship}} on multicultural education continues to focus exclusively on U. S. education. Previous studies published {{in this field}} also have focused largely on topics that are considered relevant for the United States, whereas {{little attention has been}} paid to topics that are less problematized in the United States. In this mixed-method study, we explore teachers’ understanding of multicultural education in Flanders (Belgium), and we examine whether teacher and school characteristics correlate with the degree to which teachers integrate multicultural content. Survey results with 706 in-service teachers from 68 schools and in-depth interviews with 26 teachers from 5 schools are used. The results point out that teachers focus mainly on religious diversity when they were asked about their understanding of multicultural education. However, their understanding was largely limited to the "contributions approach" and "additive approach" to multicultural education. Multilevel analysis revealed that ethnic minority teachers reported higher levels of <b>multicultural</b> content <b>integration</b> than native-White teachers, and teachers working in schools with higher share of ethnic minorities and public (State) schools incorporated more multicultural education than teachers working in elite-White schools and Catholic schools.

Firstly, we consider attitudes and policies in respect of the discrimination faced by immigrants according to their country of origin and/or economic resources.

30|$|This might {{actually}} be the appropriate moment to bring in another possible duality, namely that between a territorial {{or at least a}} country-based nationalism, including multicultural nationalism, and a transnational nationalism as deployed by Kastoryano (2018). She argues that the third generation based on migration origins, say Turks in Western Europe, are not identifying with the states in which they are citizens but with a pan-Turkish nationalism, deliberately promoted by the Turkish state but also arising from how such individuals perceive themselves as located in the global order. Certainly there is a phenomenon of transnational and diasporic identities, including those, such as membership of the Muslim ummah or the black Atlantic, which are not state-based and state-promoted. It may even be the case that some of those identities are rising in importance, or at least not fading away, but they certainly {{do not have to be}} in an exclusivist binary relation with national identities such as say German or French, an observation which I hope can be accepted as commonplace now. In fact, it is even possible that such transnational identities may be explicitly called upon to support <b>multicultural</b> nationalistic <b>integration.</b> This was the finding of Dikici (2016), who studied how The Dialogue Society, a strand of the transnational Gulen movement, played an active role in the cities of London and Bristol and Britain more generally in promoting hyphenated British-Turkish identities within a British multiculturalism.|$|R

30|$|As illustrative {{example for}} this approach, the {{influential}} empirical study of Koopmans (2010) 9 where the author argues that <b>multicultural</b> <b>integration</b> policies lead {{to social and}} economic marginalisation and therefore hamper the integration process. The assumed causal mechanism {{is based on the}} idea that multicultural policies “do not provide strong incentives for host-country language acquisition and for interethnic contacts” (Koopmans, 2010, p. 3) and “stimulate migrants to orient themselves towards their ethnic community, may have the unintended consequence of sustaining linguistic deficiencies and a lack of cultural ‘soft skills’.” (Koopmans, 2010, p. 10). Immigrants are assumed to lack country-specific skills that need to be acquired through the integration process. Policies are conceptualized as incentive structure. Immigrants are assumed to not invest into the skill acquisition in the absence of incentives. The study by Koopmans applies an institutionalist perspective of policies as incentive-structure influencing the aspirations of immigrants, here, whether to aim for the acquisition of country-specific skills and inter-ethnic contacts, or a preference for staying within ethnic communities.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{phenomenon}} of immigration and integration, which started to {{play a crucial role}} in the sphere of Dutch politics and media in the mid-nineties of the twentieth century. The start of a public debate about this topic and the gradual withdrawal from the <b>multicultural</b> <b>integration</b> model have caused immigration, integration and - since 2001 - also Islam to become among the key topics that the Dutch media have refered about and that political parties have taken stances to. Political entities that could be described as "anti-immigrant" perceive the topic of immigration as the cornerstone of their political identity, but "mainstream" political parties have eventually also had to re-evaluate their stance to this topic. Regarding immigration and integration, the media are exposed to conflicting pressures of political correctness on the one side and the appeal to their audience on the other. One of the ways how to increase the appeal is through the allure of controversy, which is something that the can be achieved by stigmatisation of Islam, especially since 2001...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{experiences}} of multicultural individuals is vital in our diverse populations. Multicultural people often need to navigate the different norms and values associated with their multiple cultural identities. Recent research on multicultural identification has focused on how individuals with multiple cultural groups manage these different identities within the self, and how this process predicts well-being. The current study built on this research by using a qualitative method to examine the process of configuring one’s identities within the self. The present study employed {{three of the four}} different multiple identity configurations in Amiot, de la Sablonni&# 232;re, Terry & Smith’s (2007) cognitive-developmental model of social identity integration: categorization, where people identify with one of their cultural groups over others; compartmentalization, where individuals maintain multiple, separate identities within themselves; and integration, where people link their multiple cultural identities. Life narratives were used to investigate the relationship between each of these configurations and well-being, as indicated by narrative coherence. It was expected that individuals with integrated cultural identities would report greater narrative coherence than individuals who compartmentalized and categorized their cultural identities. For all twenty-two participants, identity integration was significantly and positively related to narrative coherence, while compartmentalization was significantly and negatively related to narrative coherence. ANOVAs revealed that integrated and categorized participants reported significantly greater narrative coherence than compartmentalized participants. These findings are discussed in light of previous research on <b>multicultural</b> identity <b>integration...</b>|$|R

The article is divided in three main parts. First, the analytical framework based {{on the concept of}} public philosophy of integration is presented along with its operationalization, and the data used to trace it. Second, we devote the greater part of the article to analyze political developments since the early 1990 s within the teaching of mother language, religion, history and civics in compulsory education. Thirdly, we discuss the findings of the analysis, compare them to existing research on Danish and Swedish permanent residence and naturalization policies and discuss the implications for the theorizing of the civic integrationist turn and national models. We argue that two very different philosophies of (civic) integration dominate Danish and Swedish integration politics, irrespective of whether the issue is the schooling of children or the integration of adult immigrants.|$|R

We have chosen to focus our study on girls with a Muslim background and how they experience physical education in school. The subject physical education contains many different elements that can be seen as new and foreign to these students. We have also interviewed educators to see how they work with integration and how they handle any absence from PE classes. Our study contains both a qualitative and a quantitative part. The study is based on the socio-cultural theory, as it is about interaction between people with regard to one's background and language. The result from our study shows differences of the experiences that students and teachers have about PE. The study also shows that the schools have a development of work with integration, but are still lacking resources to integrate today’s students with a foreign background. The discussion in the study shows conclusions from the questionnaire and the interview survey which shows that there are difficulties for girls with Muslim background to participate in all different element that PE have.

40|$|The thesis defends {{a form of}} contextual dialogical {{multiculturalism}} {{as necessary}} to the important task of achieving cross-cultural understanding. In response to the simplified accounts of culture found within abstract liberal theory and "strong" multiculturalism, the thesis develops a position that responds to the deep reality of difference and the embeddedness of persons within different horizons, whilst {{at the same time}} sensitised to the dynamic and internally diverse nature of cultural and religious communities. Engaging with claims within contemporary debates that multiculturalism segregates communities, it is argued that a form of <b>multicultural</b> <b>integration</b> is necessary to foster connection between groups. Through appeal to a range of literature, including Anglo- Indian imaginative literature and feminist discussions of culture, the thesis develops a more subtle and nuanced understanding of culture and identity as characterised by change and continuity. Using the insights of Gadamer's hermeneutic position and the feminist "world travelling" approach, it is argued that cross-cultural understanding and dialogue can be reached only through complex recognition of the situated position from which the self and the other speak. Gadamer's metaphor of an evolving "fusion of horizons" is invoked to illustrate the ability of a dialogical contextual position to mediate a path between moral relativism and abstract universalism. The compatibility of a culturally sensitive approach with a situated universalism is illustrated through discussion of the culture of human rights, which is seen as a powerful example of universalism constructed through dialogue...|$|E

30|$|Of course, {{promoting}} contact {{also has}} dimensions relating to social class, {{but we are}} pointing here to negative perceptions and preconceptions. At this point, this policy takes an instrumental form, focusing on the conditions for communication, and {{it is here that}} interculturalism meets the <b>multicultural</b> and civic <b>integration</b> policies, considered as necessary conditions for contact. For instance, Meer and Modood (2012) argue that to allow communication, there are certain equality and power sharing requirements, or, as Levrau and Loobuyck (2013, p. 622) highlight, the fact that the NCP assumes the need for a minimum level of shared language and public culture, setting the basis for communication (see also Barrett, 2013). Interculturalism begins then when the multicultural and national civic policies have developed all their potential, not instead of them, against them or before them. Interculturalism does not see the MCP and the NCP in disjunctive terms (either one or the other), but rather as complementary paradigms. Without a certain degree of recognition of rights and fulfilment of duties, contacts can become difficult.|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} {{immigration}} {{policy has been}} exclusively an area for national politics.

But the main change happened not on an institutional but on a vantage–point scale. Free movement in the EU is a supranational right guaranteed by European laws. For non-EU citizens there are special laws on how to enter the EU labor market. In both cases we could talk more about economic involvement rather than social, political, and cultural integration. The mass migration to Europe of the last few years gave a new impulse to immigrant and re-immigrant integration theories. It was understood that the ability to decide where to live is a constitutive element of human freedom. Immigrants could {{become a part of the}} host society, but at the same time keep their own language, culture, and customs. Human rights became one of the most important dimensions of integration policy. For immigrant communities assimilation is no longer the best instrumentality for staying in a host country.

3000|$|The ICP {{starts out}} with a claim for greater dialogue, {{considering}} this to be something lacking in the two former paradigms. In addition to the rights-based and the duties-based approaches, {{there is a need}} to focus on contact between people from different backgrounds, including nationals. Interculturalism does not seek ranking as the best way to deal with the accommodation of diversity, but rather to emphasize the need to focus on something other approaches seem to have taken for granted and which does not automatically occur if there is not a policy to target it specifically. This contacts-based approach is seen as an integration policy (Guidikova, 2015), as fostering intercultural citizenship (Zapata-Barrero, 2016 b), and consequently it also needs to be seen as an important driver for a socialization process, of culture-making (Sarmento, 2014, p. 615). It takes its starting point from Allport’s (1954) contact hypothesis, which says that contact and sharing promote mutual acceptance under conditions of equality, and initiate a process of prejudice redution and knowledge formation. Through contacts, people can acquire what civic integration claims to achieve – knowledge and mutual understanding – and what <b>multicultural</b> <b>integration</b> also seeks to obtain – the combating of diversity-related discrimination and inequalities. It also allows people from different backgrounds, including national citizens, the same opportunities in society. Intercultural policies are therefore essentially seen as an anti-racist tool. 2 It takes seriously the whole formulation of the well-accepted contact hypothesis: [...] "Prejudice (unless deeply rooted in the character structure of the individual) may be reduced by equal status contact between majority and minority groups in the pursuit of common goals. The effect is greatly enhanced if this contact is sanctioned by institutional supports (i.e., by law, custom or local atmosphere), and provided it is of a sort that leads to the perception of common interests and common humanity between members of the two groups" [...] (Allport, 1954, p. 281). This anti-discrimination promotion is a fundamental element of the ICP since it focuses on the factors which hinder contact zones. There are contextual, legal, institutional and structural factors that reduce people’s motivation to interact and even build walls of separation between them based on misinterpretations of differences. Here we take into account legal frameworks concerning voting rights for foreigners and naturalization policies, as well as socio-economic opportunity gaps among citizens, where differences become the factor behind reduced contact. Anti-discrimination promotion also includes tackling disadvantage, as it is hard to see how the ICP can continue over time if one or more sectors of society are so unequal that people are led to believe they have no real stake in that society.|$|E

The Implementation of multiculturalism in UYP can be seen from vision, mission, statutes, strategic planning, and design of the campus Research Parent Emphasis on religious-plurality values. Enactment dean of the faculty of psychology and some Christianity lecturers, the elements of the curriculum of all courses required their subject of multicultural basics, as well as hidden <b>Multicultural</b> <b>integration</b> into civic Education courses and Indonesian. The supporting factor is the teaching of the tarekat. While the inhibiting factors; first, from among Kiai and other Islamic boarding school in Pasuruan region, this is due to two factors; the model of education is not the same among them. In the Islamic boarding school Ngalah, there is UYP as a scientific institution that should reflect universal values while at other schools there are SMA/MA, Colleges and Institutes only. Another factor {{is that there is a}} doctrine that teaches the tarekat fi’lu al-khoirot ila jamii al-makhluqot while another Islamic boarding school just teach only shari'ah. second, the low of human capital, due to low of human resource, the pupil easy pitted or easy bring into the conflict. The Solution offered by Kiai Sholeh are; first by studying the tarekat. Second, for students and pilgrims in particular, should be able to follow the speech and behavior of Kiai Sholeh because in private there is uswah hasanah for every human being...|$|E
40|$|Just {{after the}} {{beginning}} of the twenty-first century, the statement that ‘multiculturalism in the Netherlands has failed’ seems common. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate whether or not the Dutch ‘multicultural society’ has failed, according to John W. Berry’s concept of multiculturalism. In the first chapter of this literature study, theories of acculturation are explained and John W. Berry’s concept of bi-dimensional acculturation is formulated. The second chapter shows a historical overview of immigration policy in the Netherlands. In the third chapter, the debate on the multicultural society in the Netherlands is reconstructed through discourse analysis and gives an analysis of the five major arguments for the failure of the multicultural society. In the fourth chapter, a comparison is made of Berry’s theory of bi-dimensional acculturation and the Dutch concept of multiculturalism. The last chapter shows consequences of ineffective acculturation. This study shows that there is multiple explanation of the term ‘multiculturalism’ and that the Dutch government has never declared a <b>multicultural</b> policy of <b>integration.</b> According to Berry’s bi-dimensional model of acculturation, policies of integration in the Netherlands doesn’t seem that multicultural at al...|$|R
30|$|Compared to the MCP and the NCP, what {{do these}} three {{normative}} parameters of the ICP tell us in relation to setting the premises for a policy paradigm change? First, {{by virtue of its}} origins, the European view of interculturalism {{can be seen as a}} policy rebellion of cities against the state domination of policy in recent decades. The <b>multicultural</b> and civic <b>integration</b> models were thought out essentially at the state level and have rarely considered multi-level perspectives in the implementation of policies. This state-centric view of diversity management probably explains why their defenders propose rights-based and duties-based approaches to diversity, since they assume the state is the first institution addressing the diversity issues and framing whatever policy at whatever level of governance. Together with a different view of diversity, the MCP’s and NCP’s national-state dependency methodology is probably one of the first substantial differences when we compare them with the ICP. Cities are now organizing welcoming events for newcomers as a way to provide knowledge about the host society and the city, and they also offer language courses as part of the city’s public assistance. In contrast, multicultural policies are also developed at the city level, but always under an administrative decentralization process beginning at the state level.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} meditational {{analysis}} role of outgroup social capital when testing the integration hypothesis are presented. We considered how acculturation strategies, individual social capital and subjective well-being of persons {{living in a}} multicultural environment are related. The sample included representatives of three ethnic groups, living in the Republic of Dagestan: Avars (N= 105), Dargins (N= 121), and Russians (N= 100). We used a modified method of "resource generator" to study the individual social capital. Also we used a Russian version of Berry's method of assessing acculturation strategies and subjective well-being. The obtained empirical {{data were analyzed using}} structural equation modeling. We hypothesized that the choice of integration strategy does not only promote harmonious intergroup relationships, but also has positive effects on well-being on the individual level. Those who choose the integration strategy end up with stronger social capital that works as a protective factor against various negative life events, promoting the overall well-being. However, our hypothesis was supported with Russians only, with Avars and Dargins it was supported with some restrictions. The results of this study shed light onto the socio-psychological mechanisms of integration of ethnic groups in a <b>multicultural</b> region, where <b>integration</b> is closely linked with mutual help and support across the ethnic boundaries...|$|R
