40|$|The {{emerging}} {{field of}} critical <b>mobilities</b> research posits {{the need to}} replace sedentary approaches to nation-states as containers for national societies and repositories of national histories with a far more relational understanding of transnational and cross-regional dynamics. It proposes “mobile methodologies” for research that cross national boundaries, including following people, commodities, and cultures as they circulate between various interlinked sites of production and consumption. Yet few have noted the debt of <b>mobilities</b> research to Caribbean Studies and to the theoretical trajectories that have arisen out {{of research on the}} colonial and postcolonial Atlantic world. This article aims to situate the “new <b>mobilities</b> paradigm” in relation to Caribbean and transnational American Studies, and to mobilize Caribbean Studies as an approach that transcends regional or national paradigms. After tracing some of the theoretical intersections of <b>mobilities</b> theory and Caribbean Studies, the article sketches the arc of the author’s own work, leading into a current research project on the <b>mobilities</b> of bauxite/aluminum as a material object.

40|$|<b>Mobilities</b> of people, capital, labour, expertise, {{resources}} and images create significant challenges for sustainable destination governance. This paper discusses {{the implications of}} <b>mobilities</b> for destination governance where fluid populations of tourists, residents, second home owners and recreationists, and transnational flows of labour and capital intersect to create and recreate the physical, social, economic and political characteristics of place. Three key processes that affect destination management are identified: the spatial restructuring of destinations, the pluralisation of destination management and the re-envisioning of community. In {{a study of the}} hyper-neoliberal destination of the Gold Coast, Australia, <b>mobilities</b> are examined and implications for governance are discussed. Our research highlights the challenges of measuring, evaluating and understanding the extent and complexity of <b>mobilities,</b> and explores the tensions between <b>mobilities</b> and established sustainable tourism principles that suggest governance should be grounded in local community dialogue and values. The differences between “hard” and “soft” power structures in destination governance are noted. The paper contributes methodological insights into the study of <b>mobilities</b> and to theoretical and practical debates about the influence of <b>mobilities</b> on sustainable destination management, especially the need to re-visit the meanings of long-accepted concepts in sustainable tourism, including “public interest”, “community” and “community-based” tourism...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the launch}} of this journal ten years ago, the field of <b>mobilities</b> {{research}} has developed at a rapid pace. In this editorial introduction we explore how this development has been curated, how the field has evolved, and what maturation might mean for <b>mobilities</b> research. After reviewing how early editorials encouraged particular trajectories of development within <b>mobilities</b> research, we introduce the papers in this special issue, which build upon and re-shape key discussions that have emerged in the last decade. Drawing out issues of power, interdisciplinarity, social processes and futures, the papers raise important questions about not only how understandings of <b>mobilities</b> are changing, but also how the field of <b>mobilities</b> research is itself on the move. Taking up these themes, we examine how understanding <b>mobilities</b> research as a field, following Bourdieu (1984), contributes to considerations {{of the potential for}} future struggles, fragmentation, and sub-disciplines. We argue that the open nature and strategic diversity of the <b>mobilities</b> field has fed the successes of the past decade, and therefore needs to remain a priority in the future – with a careful balance curated between convergence around key themes and the exploration of varied ‘internal goods’ (MacIntyre 1985) which remain an important source of inspiration and creative potential within the field...|$|R

In this paper, the importance of the dispersion of charge carrier motion on the performance of organic photovoltaic devices is investigated.

This experiment is applied to different blends and shows that extraction time is directly related to the geometrical average of the steady-state <b>mobilities.</b> This demonstrates that under realistic operating conditions the steady-state <b>mobilities</b> govern the charge extraction of OPV and gives a valuable insight in device performance...|$|R

40|$|A {{simple and}} closed form {{solution}} for the vibration response of finite ribbed plates to point force/moment excitations is presented in this paper. This solution shows that input <b>mobilities</b> of finite ribbed plates are bounded by the input <b>mobilities</b> of the uncoupled plate and beam that form the ribbed plate. It is found that point force input <b>mobilities</b> of a finite ribbed plate are controlled by the plate bending stiffness when the excitation force {{is more than a}} quarter wavelength away from the beam. The input <b>mobilities</b> are mainly dominated by the beam flexural stiffness when the force acts on or very close to the beam, and when the beam flexural stiffness is far greater than the plate bending stiffness. Similar result is found in the moment excitation case when the moment axis is perpendicular to the beam neutral axis (bending moment excitation). In contrast, the input <b>mobilities</b> of the ribbed plate do not vary much from that of the corresponding uncoupled plate when the moment axis parallels to the beam’s neutral axis (torsional moment excitation) where the input <b>mobilities</b> are mainly dominated by the plate bending stiffness.
