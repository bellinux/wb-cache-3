5|$|Domains are a {{relatively}} new grouping. First proposed in 1977, Carl Woese's three-domain system was not generally accepted until later. One <b>main</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the three-domain method is the separation of Archaea and Bacteria, previously grouped into the single kingdom Bacteria (a kingdom also sometimes called Monera), with the Eukaryota for all organisms whose cells contain a nucleus. A small number of scientists include a sixth kingdom, Archaea, but do not accept the domain method.|$|E
5|$|The Mysida {{belong to}} the {{superorder}} Peracarida, which means “near to shrimps”. Although in many respects mysids appear similar to some shrimps, the <b>main</b> <b>characteristic</b> separating them from the superorder Eucarida is their lack of free-swimming larvae. The order Mysida is extensive and currently includes approximately 160 genera, containing more than 1000 species.|$|E
5|$|Adult males enter a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The <b>main</b> <b>characteristic</b> of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.|$|E

25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the Villanovans (with some {{similarities}} {{with the}} so-called protovillanovian epoch of the late Bronze Age) were the incinerated sepultures, in which the dead's ashes were housed in double-cone shaped urns and buried. The burial characteristics relate the Villanovan culture to the Central European Urnfield culture (c. 1300–750 BC), and Hallstatt culture (which succeeded the Urnfield culture).|$|E
25|$|A {{denial of}} the epistemic {{authority}} of the Vedas and Upanishads {{was one of the}} several differences between Sramanic philosophies and orthodox Hinduism. Jaini states that while authority of vedas, belief in a creator, path of ritualism and social system of heredity ranks, made up the cornerstones of Brahminal schools, the path of ascetic self-motification was the <b>main</b> <b>characteristic</b> of all the Sramanic schools.|$|E
25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>characteristic</b> of {{the recent}} ITU CWDM {{standard}} is that the signals are not spaced appropriately for amplification by EDFAs.

The relaxed optical frequency stabilization requirements allow the associated costs of CWDM to approach those of non-WDM optical components.|$|E

25|$|The {{relief of}} Bulgaria is varied. In the {{relatively}} small territory of the country there are extensive lowlands, plains, hills, low and high mountains, many valleys and deep gorges. The <b>main</b> <b>characteristic</b> of Bulgaria's topography is four alternating bands {{of high and low}} terrain that extend east to west across the country. From north to south, those bands, called geomorphological regions, are the Danubian Plain, the Balkan Mountains, the Transitional region and the Rilo-Rhodope region. The easternmost sections near the Black Sea are hilly, but they gradually gain height to the west until the westernmost part of the country is entirely high ground.|$|E
25|$|His {{research}} has sparked criticism, in particular from French scholars {{who argue that}} the Vichy regime (1940–1944) was of a more traditional conservative persuasion, although belonging to the far-right, than it was counter-revolutionary, counter-revolutionary ideas being a <b>main</b> <b>characteristic</b> of fascism. René Rémond has questioned Sternhell's attribution of 'boulangisme' to the revolutionary right-wing movements. Some scholars say that Sternhell's thesis may shed important light on intellectual influences of fascism, but fascism in itself was not born of a sole ideology and its sociological make-up and popularity among the working classes {{must also be taken}} into account.|$|E
25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>characteristic</b> {{of these}} scripts was their writing style. The letters {{in most of}} these manuscripts are heavy-looking, {{relatively}} short and horizontally elongated. The slanted isolated form of the alif that was present in the Umayyad period completely disappeared and was replaced by a straight shaft with a pronounced right-sided foot, set at a considerable distance from the following letter. Also, unlike the Hijazi scripts, these are often richly illuminated in gold and other colors. Another difference is that sura headings are clearly marked and enclosed in rectangular panels with marginal vignettes or palmettes protruding into the outer margins. These Qurans of the early Abbasid period were also bound in wooden boards, structured like a box enclosed on all sides with a movable upper cover that was fastened {{to the rest of the}} structure with leather thongs.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century {{this type}} of {{farmhouse}} was outmoded. What was once its greatest advantage - having everything under a single roof - now led to its decline. Rising standards of living meant that the smells, breath and manure from the animals was increasingly viewed as unhygienic. In addition the living quarters became too small for the needs of the occupants. Higher harvest returns and the use of farm machinery in the Gründerzeit led to the construction of modern buildings. The old stalls under the eaves were considered too small for today's cattle. Since the middle of the 19th century fewer and fewer of these farmhouses were built and some of the existing ones were converted to adapt to new circumstances. Often the old buildings were torn down in order to create space for new ones. In the original region where once the Low German house was common, it was increasingly replaced by the Ernhaus whose <b>main</b> <b>characteristic</b> was a separation of living quarters from the livestock sheds.|$|E
25|$|Hatshepsut had the {{expedition}} commemorated in relief at Deir el-Bahri, {{which is also}} famous for its realistic depiction of the Queen of the Land of Punt, Queen Ati. The Puntite Queen is portrayed as relatively tall and her physique was generously proportioned, with large breasts and rolls of fat on her body. Due to the fat deposits on her buttocks, it has sometimes been argued {{that she may have}} had steatopygia. However, according to the pathologist Marc Armand Ruffer, the <b>main</b> <b>characteristic</b> of a steatopygous woman is a disproportion in size between the buttocks and thighs, which was not the case with Ati. She instead appears to have been generally obese, a condition that was exaggerated by excessive lordosis or curvature of the lower spine. Hatshepsut also sent raiding expeditions to Byblos and Sinai shortly after the Punt expedition. Very little is known about these expeditions. Although many Egyptologists have claimed that her foreign policy was mainly peaceful, it is possible that she led military campaigns against Nubia and Canaan.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the strip}} {{did not have}} a lead {{character}} at the onset, it soon began to focus on Charlie Brown, a character developed from some of the painful experiences of Schulz' formative years. In early strips, Charlie Brown was depicted as distinctly younger than his cohorts Patty and Shermy. Charlie Brown's <b>main</b> <b>characteristic</b> is either self-defeating stubbornness or admirably determined persistence to try his best against all odds: he can never win a ballgame but continues playing baseball; he can never fly a kite successfully but continues trying to do so. Though his inferiority complex was evident from the start, in the earlier strips he also got in his own jabs when verbally sparring with Patty and Shermy. Some early strips also involved romantic attractions between Charlie Brown and Patty or Violet. On September 1, 1958, Charlie Brown's father was formally revealed to be a barber (after earlier instances in the strip that linked Charlie Brown to barbers by implication). In 1960, the now popular line of Charlie Brown greeting cards was introduced by Hallmark Cards. Charlie Brown and Snoopy reached new heights on May 18, 1969, as they became the names of the command module and lunar module, respectively, for Apollo 10.|$|E

They met at the packed theatre Odeon of Herodes Atticus in a recital of superb orchestrations for a grand orchestra under the direction of Nick Davies and the participation of Joan Faulkner, the famous American jazz singer.

In November 2000, they, once more, met in Russia, in a concert that was staged in Grand Kremlin Palace’s George Hall.|$|E

500|$|The Joker's <b>main</b> <b>characteristic</b> is his {{apparent}} insanity, {{although he is}} not described as having any particular psychological disorder. Like a psychopath, he lacks empathy, a conscience, and concern over right and wrong. In A Serious House on Serious Earth, the Joker is described as capable of processing outside sensory information only by adapting to it. This enables him {{to create a new}} personality every day (depending on what would benefit him) and explains why, at different times, he is a mischievous clown or a psychopathic killer. In [...] "The Clown at Midnight" [...] (Batman #663, 2007), the Joker enters a meditative state where he evaluates his previous selves to consciously create a new personality, effectively modifying himself for his needs.|$|E
