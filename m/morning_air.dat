5|$|In the morning, {{under cover}} of a heavy ground fog, the North Koreans struck Check's {{battalion}} in a counterattack. This began a heavy fight which lasted all <b>morning.</b> <b>Air</b> strikes using napalm incinerated many North Korean troops and helped the infantry to gain the ridge. At 12:00, the 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry, secured the former positions of the 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry, and took over the same foxholes that unit had abandoned two nights before. During September 2, the Air Force flew 135 sorties in the 25th Infantry Division sector, reportedly destroying many North Korean units, several tanks and artillery pieces, and three villages containing ammunition dumps.|$|E

2500|$|In 1979, Stern spotted an {{advertisement}} in Radio & Records for a [...] "wild, fun morning guy" [...] at rock station WCCC in Hartford, Connecticut. He used some <b>morning</b> <b>air</b> time to assemble an aircheck with more outrageous bits, including Robert Klein and Cheech and Chong records with added flatulence routines and one-liners. Stern was hired {{for the same}} salary, but worked a more intense schedule. After four hours on the air, he voiced and produced commercials for another four. On Saturdays, following a six-hour show, he did production work for the next three. He also completed duties as the station's public affairs director, and hosted a Sunday morning talk show which he favored above playing records as it [...] "represented what I wanted to do on radio more than anything. Take the average guy and dissect what he does". In the summer of the 1979 energy crisis, Stern urged listeners to a two-day boycott of Shell Oil Company, a stunt which attracted media attention. It was at WCCC where Stern first met Fred Norris, the overnight disc jockey, {{who went on to}} become Stern's writer and producer since 1981. Stern left WCCC in early 1980 after he was denied a [...] "lousy, stinking twenty-five-dollar-a-week raise". At the same time, local rival station WHCN had assembled tapes and press clippings of Stern and forwarded them to Burkhart/Abrams, a radio consulting firm, {{in an effort to get}} Stern out of the Hartford market as a rise in his ratings increased his threat to the station's numbers. The tapes were received by Dwight Douglas, a consultant at Burkhart/Abrams, who offered Stern work in Columbus, Ohio, but Stern declined.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fire was}} very active during the night, growing to [...] by {{the morning of}} August 21. [...] Much of this growth was {{on the west side}} of the fire where it was burning back into the Three Sisters Wilderness, moving toward Lava Camp Lake and North Matthieu Lake. [...] In the <b>morning,</b> <b>air</b> {{operations}} had to stand down for about hour during the solar eclipse. [...] Ground crews also paused briefly to watch the eclipse. [...] During the day, ground and air operations continued to focus on the east side of the fire where crews extended and strengthened fire lines to ensure private property near Sisters remained secure while Oregon State Fire Marshal teams patrol the evacuated neighborhoods. [...] In the afternoon, air operations had to be discontinued due to heavy smoke that created a flight safety hazard. [...] By the end of the day, the fire had grown to [...] with 644 firefighters on scene. [...] The Forest Service estimated that the fire was 20 percent contained. On August 22, the day began with 675 firefighters assigned to the fire. [...] Because the northeast and southeast sides of the fire were effectively contained, fire managers shifted firefighting resources to the northwest side where the fire still threatened some homes and private property. [...] However, some crews remained on the east side to patrol fire lines, spraying water to hot spots and looking for spot fires. [...] The state fire marshal crews also continued to patrol evacuated neighborhoods and began assessing fire risk at Black Butte Ranch and other area along the Route 242 corridor west of Sisters. During the day, fire activity was moderate with the flames moving westward along the north side of Black Crater and slowly backing down the southern slope of Black Crater toward Lava Lake Camp and North Matthieu Lake. [...] There was torching and crowning in isolated areas when winds pushed the fire up steep slopes. [...] However, aircraft remained grounded all day due to smoky conditions. [...] In the late afternoon, crews prepared to do burnout work on the northwest side of the fire if nighttime weather condition were favorable.|$|E
