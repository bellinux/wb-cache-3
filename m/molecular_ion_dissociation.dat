40|$|This {{investigation}} {{focuses on}} the spectroscopic study of the fundamental question: “how to control and manipulate molecules”. The following three studies touch these questions from different angles. ^ First in Chapter 2, we use the powerful AOTR to probe Na 2 molecules near their equilibrium intemuclear distance, Re ″(∼ 3 Å), but at high levels of electronic excitation. For the nf(l = 3) series of Na 2, quantum defects are calculated from theoretical values of the core quadrupole moment and polarizabilities. We predict the stroboscopic effect should first occur when n = 52 for the nf series, as we observe, rather than at n = 69 for the np series. Our data thus confirm that the strongest series is the nf. Hence the ionization potential is not 39478. 75 ± 0. 04 cm− 1 as previously reported, but rather 39478. 101 ± 0. 013 cm− 1, implying a <b>molecular</b> <b>ion</b> <b>dissociation</b> energy of D 00 (Na 2 +) = 7914. 038 ± 0. 014 cm− 1. ^ Then in Chapter 3, we again use AOTR to shift the distance probed to ∼ 6. 44 Å, but again explore high levels of electronic excitation. We have observed the 51 Πu, 61 Σu + and 71 Σu+ states of Na 2. Although the absolute vibrational numbering is uncertain, the rotational constants are obtained. The Franck-Condon window concept is presented with calculated Franck-Condon factors based on the theoretical 5 1 Πu, 61 Σu+ and 71 Σu+ potential energy curves of Magnier. Finally in Chapter 4, the molecules again remain at relatively short distance near Re″, but a scheme is proposed for making highly rotationally excited diatomic molecules (“Super Rotors”) in their ground vibrational and electronic state, e. g. 6 Li 2 X 1 Σg+ (v = 0, J ≥ 115) where the rotational energy exceeds the bond strength (E(0,J) -E(0, 0) ≥ D 00). Such levels, while strictly speaking quasibound, have very long tunneling lifetimes, and should have very interesting and unique collisional properties, especially at low temperature. The rotation of the molecules is “spun up” by sequential irradiation by R branch photons in the A 1 Σu+–X 1 Σg+ bands starting with cold molecules at low J. Spontaneous emission to other vibrational levels is overcome by using a pump laser and its multiple Raman sidebands as in previous work on “spinning down” diatomics. ...|$|E

A fly-through Brink-type electron impact ion source was used, utilizing a vacuum background ion filtration technique based on {{differences between the}} kinetic energy of the supersonic beam species and that of thermal molecules. The 70 -eV electron impact mass spectra of all the alkanes were characterized by a pronounced or dominant molecular weight peak together with all the fragment ions normally exhibited by the standard thermal 70 -eV EI mass spectra. In contrast, the NIST library of most of these molecules did not show any molecular weight peak. By eliminating the intramolecular thermal vibrational energy we gained control over the degree of molecular ion fragmentation by the electron energy. At an electron energy of 18 eV the <b>molecular</b> <b>ion</b> <b>dissociation</b> was further reduced considerably, with only a small absolute reduction in the peak height by less than a factor of 2. The effect of vibrational cooling increased with the molecular size and number of atoms. Pronounced differences were observed between the mass spectra of the straight chain triacontane and its branched isomer squalane. Similar mass spectra of octacosane (C 28 H 58) achieved with 70 -eV EI in a supersonic molecular beam were obtained with a magnetic sector mass spectrometer by using an electron energy of 14 eV and an ion source temperature of 150 °C. However, this ion source temperature precluded the gas chromatography—mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of octacosane. The GC-MS of alkanes was studied with an ion trap gas chromatograph—mass spectrometer at an ion source temperature of 230 °C. Thermal peak tailing was observed for C 20 H 42 and heavier alkanes, whereas for C 28 H 58 and heavier alkanes the severe peak tailing made quantitative GC-MS impractical. In contrast, no peak tailing existed even with C 40 H 82 for GC-MS in supersonic molecular beams. The minimum detected amount of eicosane (C 20 H 42) was shown to be 60 fg. This was demonstrated by using single ion monitoring with the quadrupole mass analyzer tuned to the molecular weight peak of 282 u. The coupling of electron impact mass spectrometry in supersonic molecular beams with hyperthermal surface ionization and a fast GC-MS inlet is briefly discussed...|$|E

The formation and <b>dissociation</b> of <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> with well defined internal energies has been analyzed from breakdown curves, photoionization onsets, and rate constant determinations. ^ The threshold photoelectron detector used in this TPEPICO mass spectrometer (i. e., a collimated hole structure) has a high collection efficiency and good energy resolution in terms of FWHM; however, distortion of breakdown graphs may occur from the transmission of a long 2 ̆ 2 tail 2 ̆ 2 of non-zero kinetic energy electrons transmitted through this detector. A method has been developed in which the contribution of these electrons to the breakdown curves can be estimated. The inherent assumptions and limitations of this method are discussed in detail. ^ The energetics and mechanism of decomposition of propane ion to ethylene ion and methane have been examined using isotopically labeled propane, propane- 2 -(2 ̆ 713) C. A significant fraction of all methane ions lost from the parent ion involves {{the elimination of the}} central carbon; this fragmentation is believed to occur by a stepwise cleavage involving a tight transition state rather than by an isomerization of the <b>molecular</b> <b>ion.</b> ^ Elucidation of the reaction mechanism leading to the formation of a fragment ion may be complicated by rearrangement of the <b>molecular</b> <b>ion</b> prior to fragmentation. Such a case is observed in the fragmentation of the nitromethane ion (CH(, 3) NO(, 2) (2 ̆ 7 +)). At onset, fragmentation of the nitromethane ion to NO(2 ̆ 7 +) is preceded by an isomerization to the methylnitrite ion; the barrier to isomerization is 0. 64 eV. Symmetry considerations indicate that the nitromethane ion in its (2 ̆ 72) A(, 2) ((pi)) state correlates with the (2 ̆ 72) A 2 ̆ 2 ((pi)) state of the methylnitrite <b>ion</b> through which <b>dissociation</b> to the NO(2 ̆ 7 +) fragment occurs. ^ The unimolecular dissociation of energy-selected methylnitrite and deuterated methylnitrite ions (CH(, 3) ONO(2 ̆ 7 +) and CD(, 3) ONO(2 ̆ 7 +), respectively) was examined also and found to show exceptional behavior near threshold.

Gas-phase ion chemistry involving ion thermochemistry and <b>ion</b> <b>dissociation</b> characteristics, is one of the foundations of analytical chemistry. A signal (peak) in a mass spectrum is only identified by its mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and may represent several isomeric ions. Isomeric species having the same element composition can be distinguished by tandem mass spectrometry. An investigation of isomeric (C,H 3,N,O) +- ions provides such an example, where four isomeric ions ((H 2 NC(H) O) +-, (H 2 NCOH) +-, (H 3 CNO) +- and (H 2 CNOH) +-) and their neutral counterparts were identified by a combination of experimental results and a recent high level ab initio molecular orbital theory calculation.

PDMS is best carried out on solids; accordingly, the samples were frozen.

The event-byevent mode of desorption and detection was exploited with coincidence counting to study relationships between deprotonated <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> and H+.

The setup {{is based on a}} cryogenic 22 -pole radiofrequency ion trap which allows collisional cooling of the H+ 3 <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> by the use of helium buffergas. The <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> can be extracted from the trap and transferred to the storage ring (TSR) for recombination experiments. First results suggest that by the use of this setup a spectrum of the dissociative recombination of cold H+ 3 <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> could be measured. Moreover the setup can be used to probe gas phase chemical reactions at low temperatures. The formation of deuterium cluster ions at 13 K was studied and rate coefficients for association and dissociation reactions of these clusters ions could be extracted...|$|R
5000|$|In the muon-catalyzed {{fusion of}} most interest, a {{positively}} charged deuteron (d), a positively charged triton (t), and a muon essentially form a positively charged muonic <b>molecular</b> heavy hydrogen <b>ion</b> (d-μ-t)+. The muon, with a rest mass about 207 {{times greater than}} the rest mass of an electron, is able to drag the more massive triton and deuteron about 207 times closer together {{to each other in the}} muonic (d-μ-t)+ <b>molecular</b> <b>ion</b> than can an electron in the corresponding electronic (d-e-t)+ <b>molecular</b> <b>ion.</b> The average separation between the triton and the deuteron in the electronic <b>molecular</b> <b>ion</b> is about one angstrom (100 pm), so the average separation between the triton and the deuteron in the muonic <b>molecular</b> <b>ion</b> is about 207 times smaller than that. [...] Due to the strong nuclear force, whenever the triton and the deuteron in the muonic <b>molecular</b> <b>ion</b> happen to get even closer to each other during their periodic vibrational motions, the probability is very greatly enhanced that the positively charged triton and the positively charged deuteron would undergo quantum tunnelling through the repulsive Coulomb barrier that acts to keep them apart. Indeed, the quantum mechanical tunnelling probability depends roughly exponentially on the average separation between the triton and the deuteron, allowing a single muon to catalyze the d-t nuclear fusion in less than about half a picosecond, once the muonic <b>molecular</b> <b>ion</b> is formed.|$|R

40|$|AbstractA new quantitation method, {{based on}} the {{detection}} of M 2 + <b>molecular</b> <b>ions,</b> is presented. It {{has been shown that}} M 2 + <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> are formed by a recombination process between independently sputtered M and M+ particles. Based on this formation mechanism, it will be demonstrated that M 2 + <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> can be used to quantitate major elements. The method will be used for quantitation of an AlxGa 1 −xAs multilayer. Furthermore, it will be shown that some matrix effects {{can be explained by the}} energy dependence of instrument transmission...|$|R

The dependence of {{the shape of the}} observed anomaly on the molecular-ion species and the target thickness is accounted for using the parameters of the <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> and a standard resonance shape determined using a proton beam. In addition to explaining the interaction of <b>molecular</b> <b>ion</b> beams with a thin target, these results provide a technique for extending precise energy-calibration standards to significantly higher energies...|$|R
5000|$|Collision-induced {{dissociation}} (CID), {{also known}} as collisionally activated dissociation (CAD), is a mass spectrometry technique to induce fragmentation of <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> in the gas phase. [...] The <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> are usually accelerated by some electrical potential to high kinetic energy and then allowed to collide with neutral molecules (often helium, nitrogen or argon). In the collision some of the kinetic energy is converted into internal energy which results in bond breakage and the fragmentation of the <b>molecular</b> <b>ion</b> into smaller fragments. These fragment ions can then be analyzed by a tandem mass spectrometry.|$|R
