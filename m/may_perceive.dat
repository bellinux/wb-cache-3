Serious relationship disturbances are considered likely to be important contributors to difficulties in establishing new attachment relationships. Psychiatric and substance abuse histories and other criminal activities are common. Developmental delays in the children are common {{and there is a}} considerable range of regulatory, socioemotional and developmental problems. The child <b>may</b> <b>perceive</b> relationships as inconsistent and undependable. Further, despite harsh and inconsistent treatment many of the children remain attached to their parents, complicating the development of new attachment relationships.|$|E

25|$|Norwegians are {{accustomed}} to variation, and <b>may</b> <b>perceive</b> Danish and Swedish only as slightly more distant dialects. This is because they have two official written standards, {{in addition to the}} habit of strongly holding on to local dialects. The people of Stockholm, Sweden and Copenhagen, Denmark, have the greatest difficulty in understanding other Scandinavian languages. In the Faroe Islands and Iceland, learning Danish is mandatory. This causes Faroese people as well as Icelandic people to become bilingual in two very distinct North Germanic languages, making it relatively easy for them to understand the other two Mainland Scandinavian languages.|$|E
25|$|The younger {{generation}} and commoners, with minimal education still address each other using ty with no connotation of disrespect, however. Certain Russians {{who are used}} to vy-address <b>may</b> <b>perceive</b> the ones who don’t differentiate between ty and vy forms as uneducated, offensive and uncultured. This leads to the conclusion that this honorific was not a Russian innovation. Instead, the use of vy in both the singular and plural form is due to the exposure to the Latin historical and political developments. The usage of vy did not spread throughout the Russian population quickly; as a result, the usage was inconsistent until the eighteenth century, when Vy became more prominent in secular literature.|$|E
25|$|Phantom limbs are a {{phenomenon}} which occurs following amputation of a limb from an individual. In 90–98% of cases, amputees report feeling {{all or part}} of the limb or body part still there, taking up space. The amputee <b>may</b> <b>perceive</b> a limb under full control, or paralyzed. A common side effect of phantom limbs is phantom limb pain. The neurophysiological mechanisms by which phantom limbs occur is still under debate. A common theory posits that the afferent neurons, since deafferented due to amputation, typically remap to adjacent cortical regions within the brain. This can cause amputees to report feeling their missing limb being touched when a seemingly unrelated part of the body is stimulated (such as if the face is touched, but the amputee also feels their missing arm being stroked in a specific location). Another facet of phantom limbs is that the efferent copy (motor feedback) responsible for reporting on position to the body schema does not attenuate quickly. Thus the missing body part may be attributed by the amputee to still be in a fixed or movable position.|$|E

500|$|He {{moved to}} Premier League club Sheffield Wednesday on a {{four-year}} contract on 25 March 1999, with the £950,000 fee being the highest received for a York player. On his transfer, Cresswell said: [...] "This move is no disrespect to York, it's just that I {{have always wanted}} to play at a much bigger club and as high as possible". Manager Danny Wilson described Cresswell as [...] "one for the future" [...] after admitting the player [...] "is not the striker people <b>may</b> <b>perceive</b> as the big one we were chasing". His debut came in Wednesday's 2–1 home defeat to Coventry City on 3 April 1999, before scoring his first goal with an 87th-minute winner at home to Liverpool in a 1–0 win on 8 May. He finished 1998–99 with one goal in seven appearances for Wednesday. Cresswell completed 1999–2000 with two goals in 25 appearances, having been given few opportunities in the team, as Wednesday were relegated into the First Division.|$|E
