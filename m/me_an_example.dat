In a warmer time, a less blasphemous place, {{he would have been}} recognised as my Master and I as his Pupil. He became, for <b>me,</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of courage and integrity, humility and passion. An absolute integrity: I saw him shaken many times and I lived to see him broken but I never saw him bow." [...] He further wrote, [...] "Perhaps I should not say, flatly, what I believe – that he is a great painter – among the very greatest; but I do know that great art can only be created out of love, and that no greater lover has ever held a brush." ...|$|E

[...] So saying, he took the sword from his servant's hands, plunged it into his body, and staggering to a little bed that was near, fell over upon it in a swoon. He had received a mortal wound.|$|E

6000|$|That {{seems to}} <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> {{of the human}} touch that Rochefoucauld never allows for, the natural goodness, pity, kindness, which can assert itself in {{contempt}} of the love of self, {{and the love of}} revenge. This is that true clemency which is a real virtue, and not [...] "the child of Vanity, Fear, Indolence, or of all three together." [...] Nor is it so true that [...] "we have all fortitude enough to endure the misfortunes of others." [...] Everybody has witnessed another's grief that came as near him as his own.|$|E
6000|$|She only {{smiled at}} that {{reckless}} forgetfulness of the promise, {{by which he}} had bound himself a few minutes since. [...] "What did you tell me," [...] she asked playfully, [...] "when you called yourself by hard names, and said you didn't deserve my love?" [...] Her smile vanished softly, and left only a look of tender entreaty in its place. [...] "Set <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of firmness, Ovid--don't leave it all to me! Remember what you have made me say. Remember"--she only hesitated for a moment--"remember what an interest I have in you now. I love you, Ovid. Say you will go." ...|$|E

[...] "I perceive," [...] said he, [...] "two dangers, which are almost inevitable in this affair; on the one side, there is great cause of apprehension, lest the idolatrous merchant, having received the price of my passage, should throw me overboard, or leave me on some desart isle; on the other side, lest the governor of Canton should discharge his fury upon me, and make <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> to all strangers, by putting me to a cruel death, or condemning me to perpetual imprisonment.

But she must have tipped them off unbeknownst to me, and they knew just what to do. 'Excuse me,' she says, 'I'm going on deck a minute.' Now that minute was half an hour.

Then I took it on an empty stomach, too, and there was them three soaks setting <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example,</b> they arguing for me to take the Flibberty to Poonga-Poonga, an' me pointing out my duty to the contrary.

60|$|During the week, Clara came {{twice to}} see me--escaping from home by stealth, as before. On each occasion, she showed the same affectionate anxiety to set <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of cheerfulness, and to sustain me in hope. I saw, with a sorrow and {{apprehension}} which I could not altogether conceal from her, that the weary {{look in her}} face had never changed, never diminished since I had first observed it. Ralph had, from motives of delicacy, avoided increasing the hidden anxieties which were but too evidently preying upon her health, by keeping her in perfect ignorance of our visit to the hospital, and, indeed, of the particulars of all our proceedings since his return. I took care to preserve the same secrecy, during her short interviews with me. She bade me farewell after her third visit, with a sadness which she vainly endeavoured to hide. I little thought, then, that the tones of her sweet, clear voice had fallen on my ear for the last time, before I wandered to the far West of England where I now write.|$|E
6000|$|Dorriforth. Could you, under Falstaff's {{pasteboard}} {{cheeks and}} the sad disfigurement of his mates? There was no excess of scenery, Auberon says. Why, Falstaff's very person {{was nothing but}} scenery. A false face, a false figure, false hands, false legs--scarcely a square inch on which the irrepressible humor of the rogue could break into illustrative touches. And he is so human, so expressive, of so rich a physiognomy. One would rather Mr. Beerbohm Tree should have played the part in his own clever, elegant slimness---that would at least have represented life. A Falstaff all [...] "make-up" [...] is an opaque substance. This seems to <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of what the rest still more suggested, that in dealing with a production like the [...] "Merry Wives" [...] really the main quality to put forward is discretion. You must resolve such a production, as a thing represented, into a tone that the imagination can take an aesthetic pleasure in. Its grossness must be transposed, as it were, to a fictive scale, a scale of fainter tints and generalized signs. A filthy, eruptive, realistic Bardolph and Pistol overlay the romantic with the literal. Relegate them and blur them, to the eye; let their blotches be constructive and their raggedness relative.|$|E

60|$|About this time--it {{would be}} in 1886--I came across a book called The Reminiscences of Judge Edmunds. He was a judge of the U.S. High Courts and a man of high standing. The book gave an account of how his wife had died, and how {{he had been able}} for many years {{to keep in touch with}} her. All sorts of details were given. I read the book with interest, and {{absolute}} scepticism. It seemed to <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of how a hard practical man might have a weak side to his brain, a sort of reaction, as it were, against those plain facts of life with which he had to deal. Where was this spirit of which he talked? Suppose a man had an accident and cracked his skull; his whole character would change, and a high nature might become a low one. With alcohol or opium or many other drugs one could apparently quite change a man's spirit. The spirit then depended upon matter. These were the arguments which I used in those days. I did not realise that it was not the spirit that was changed in such cases, but the body through which the spirit worked, just as it would be no argument against the existence of a musician if you tampered with his violin so that only discordant notes could come through.|$|E
60|$|Common honour; not the honour {{of having}} done {{anything}} right, but the honour {{of not having}} done aught conspicuously foul; the honour of the inert: that was what remained to you. We are not all expected to be Damiens; a man may conceive his duty more narrowly, he may love his comforts better; and none will cast a stone at him for that. But will a gentleman of your reverend profession allow <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> from the fields of gallantry? When two gentlemen compete for the favour of a lady, and the one succeeds {{and the other is}} rejected, and (as will sometimes happen) matter damaging to the successful rival's credit reaches the ear of the defeated, it is held by plain men of no pretensions that his mouth is, in the circumstance, almost necessarily closed. Your Church and Damien's were in Hawaii upon a rivalry to do well: to help, to edify, to set divine examples. You having (in one huge instance) failed, and Damien succeeded, I marvel it should not have occurred to you that you were doomed to silence; that when you had been outstripped in that high rivalry, and sat inglorious in the midst of your well-being, in your pleasant room--and Damien, crowned with glories and horrors, toiled and rotted in that pigsty of his under the cliffs of Kalawao--you, the elect who would not, were the last man on earth to collect and propagate gossip on the volunteer who would and did.|$|E
6000|$|The {{cultivating}} {{and improvement}} of land, {{is certainly a}} subject worthy of the highest enquiry in any country, but especially in ours; where we are so strangely limited in every branch of trade, that can be of advantage to us; and utterly deprived of those, which are of the greatest importance; whereof I defy the most learned man in Europe, to produce <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> from any other kingdom in the world: For, we are denied the benefits which God and nature intended to us; as manifestly appears by our happy situation for commerce, and the great number of our excellent ports. So that, I think, little is left us, beside the cultivating our own soil, encouraging agriculture, and making great plantations of trees, that we might not be under the necessity of sending for corn and bark from England, and timber from other countries. This would {{increase the number of}} our inhabitants, and help to consume our natural products, as well as manufactures at home. And I shall never forget what I once ventured to say to a great man in England; [...] "That few politicians, with all their schemes, are half so useful members of a commonwealth, as an honest farmer; who, by skilfully draining, fencing, manuring, and planting, hath increased the intrinsic value of a piece of land; and thereby done a perpetual service to his country;" [...] which it is a great controversy, whether any of the former ever did, since the creation of the world; but no controversy at all, that ninety-nine in a hundred, have done abundance of mischief.|$|E
