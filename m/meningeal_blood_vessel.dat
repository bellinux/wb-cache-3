40|$|In {{multiple}} sclerosis {{and in its}} animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), inflammatory cells migrate across the endothelial blood-brain barrier (BBB) and {{gain access to the}} CNS. It is well-established that alpha 4 integrins are actively involved in leukocyte recruitment across the BBB during EAE. In contrast, the role of endothelial E- and P-selectin in this process has been a controversial issue. In this study, we demonstrate that P-selectin protein can be detected in <b>meningeal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> endothelial cells in healthy SJL and C 57 BL/ 6 mice and on rare parenchymal CNS blood vessels in C 57 BL/ 6, but not SJL, mice. During EAE, expression of P-selectin but not E-selectin was found up-regulated on inflamed CNS microvessels surrounded by inflammatory infiltrates irrespective of their meningeal or parenchymal localization with a more prominent immunostaining detected in C 57 BL/ 6 as compared with SJL mice. P-selectin immunostaining could be localized to CNS endothelial cells and to CD 41 -positive platelets adhering to the vessel wall. Despite the presence of P-selectin in wild-type mice, E/P-selectin-deficient SJL and C 57 BL/ 6 mice developed clinical EAE indistinguishable from wild-type mice. Absence of E- and P-selectin did neither influence the activation of myelin-specific T cells nor the composition of the cellular infiltrates in the CNS during EAE. Finally, endothelial-specific tetracycline-inducible expression of E-selectin at the BBB in transgenic C 57 BL/ 6 mice did not alter the development of EAE. Thus, E- and P-selectin are not required for leukocyte recruitment across the BBB and the development of EAE in C 57 BL/ 6 and in SJL mice...|$|E

40|$|Mural {{cells of}} the {{vertebrate}} brain maintain vascular integrity and function, play roles in stroke and are involved in maintenance of neural stem cells. However, the origins, diversity and roles of mural cells remain to be fully understood. Using transgenic zebrafish, we identified a population of isolated mural lymphatic endothelial cells surrounding <b>meningeal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> These <b>meningeal</b> mural lymphatic endothelial cells (muLECs) express lymphatic endothelial cell markers and form by sprouting from <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> In larvae, muLECs develop from a lymphatic endothelial loop in the midbrain into a dispersed, nonlumenized mural lineage. muLEC development requires normal signaling through the Vegfc–Vegfd–Ccbe 1 –Vegfr 3 pathway. Mature muLECs produce vascular growth factors and accumulate low-density lipoproteins from the bloodstream. We find that muLECs are essential for normal meningeal vascularization. Together, these data identify an unexpected lymphatic lineage and developmental mechanism necessary for establishing normal <b>meningeal</b> <b>blood</b> vasculature...|$|R
40|$|Recently, a rare form of {{congenital}} {{muscular dystrophy}} {{has been shown to}} be associated with a deficiency of laminin a 2 chain, a tissue-specific component of the basal lamina. Besides muscular dystrophy, children affected with this disorder also show electrophysiological and magnetic resonance imaging evidence of white matter involvement in the central nervous system (CNS). We have studied the precise localization of laminin a 2 chain in normal human brain, using specific electron microscopic techniques including thin-section fracture labeling and cryoultramicrotomy, in parallel with immunohistochemical techniques. We found that this laminin chain was localized to the basal lamina of all cerebral <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> whereas <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> of the choroid plexus did not show any reaction. No positive reaction was found in <b>meningeal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> either. We hypothesize that in normal brain, laminin a 2 may be important for the selective filtration capability of the blood-brain barrier. The lack of laminin a 2 in cerebral vessels of children with laminin a 2 -deficient {{congenital muscular dystrophy}} may cause impaired selective filtration, leading to leakage of plasma components and damage to the CNS. Further studies should be performed on patients affected by congenital muscular dystrophy associated with laminin a 2 deficiency to test this hypothesis...|$|R
50|$|Because <b>meningeal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> {{comprise}} part of {{the outermost}} layer of the brain, they often leave vascular grooves in the cranial cavity that are captured in endocasts. Endocranial vasculature originates around the foramina in the skull and in a living body would supply blood to the calvaria and dura mater. The vasculature is so well preserved in some fossils that terminal branches of the circulatory system can be observed. Analysis of cranial vasculature concentrates on the anterior meningeal system of the frontal region, the middle meningeal system of the parieto-temporal and {{part of the}} anterior occipital region, and the cerebellar fossa system of the cerebellar region. In the course of hominid evolution, the middle meningeal system has undergone the most change. Although cranial vasculature has been exhaustively studied in the last century, there has been no consensus on an identification scheme for the branches and patterns of the vascular system resulting from little overlap of results between studies. As such, endocranial vasculature is better suited for inferring the amount of blood delivered to different parts of the brain.|$|R
40|$|Demyelinization was {{regularly}} conspicuous in {{the white}} matter of the rostral portions of the brains of 6 monkeys sacrificed 14 to 22 months after exposure of the ocular regions to 850 r. e. p. of 14 mev. neutron radiation {{and it was not}} present in the brain of a monkey 2 months after radiation under identical conditions; or in those of 5 non-radiated animals serving as controls. In early lesions, the individual myelin sheaths were varicose and fragmented, while the neurons, axons, and glial cells remained normal in appearance. With the passage of time, the degeneration of myelin became more marked and in later stages was accompanied by a degeneration of the axis cylinders, a proliferation of astrocytes and microglia, and minor cytological changes in the oligodendroglia, the whole process occurring essentially without inflammation or notable changes in the cerebral or <b>meningeal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> The findings show that neutron radiation has the property of destroying myelin in the living animal and inducing changes that are notably similar in their pathogenesis to those that characterize disseminated encephalomyelitis in human beings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Migraine is a painful, {{sometimes}} debilitating disorder, {{which is}} frequently associated with various neurological symptoms. Its prevalence {{in the population}} is {{higher than that of}} any other neurological disorders, thus the burden of this disease on society is considerable. Although the introduction of triptans nearly two decades ago revolutionized the treatment of the disease there is still a huge unmet need regarding drugs with better properties. Formerly, migraine therapy primarily aimed at treating the pathological alterations of <b>meningeal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> that are thought to directly initiate a migraine headache attack. By now, it has been increasingly recognized by drug companies that abnormal neural function may be more important {{in the development of the}} disease and also in triggering an attack. Migraine is associated with an increased neuronal excitability and episodes of cortical spreading depression. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the abnormal functioning of over-activated neuronal circuits may help to identify novel anti-migraine drug targets. Besides a general description of the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of migraine this review paper aims at discussing the possible drug targets through which migraine-related hyperexcitability and over-excitation can be attenuated. It will be shown how these new ideas appear in the recent patent literature...|$|R
40|$|After virus infection, {{cytotoxic}} T lymphocytes (CTLs) divide {{rapidly to}} eradicate the pathogen and prevent the establishment of persistence. The magnitude of an antiviral CTL response {{is thought to be}} controlled by the initiation of a cell cycle program within lymphoid tissues. However, it is presently not known whether this division program proceeds during migration or is influenced locally at sites of viral infection. We demonstrate that antiviral CTLs remain in cell cycle while transiting to infected tissues. Up to one third of virus-specific CTLs within blood were found to be in cell cycle after infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or vesicular stomatitis virus. Using two-photon microscopy, we found that effector CTL divided rapidly upon arrest in the virus-infected central nervous system as well as in <b>meningeal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> We also observed that MHC I-dependent interactions, but not costimulation, influenced the division program by advancing effector CTL through stages of the cell cycle. These results demonstrate that CTLs are poised to divide in transit and that their numbers can be influenced locally at the site of infection through interactions with cells displaying cognate antigen...|$|R
40|$|Dopamine receptors (Dar) {{were studied}} as a {{component}} of the nervous dopaminergic system in the human dura mater. Dar were stained in several dural zones (vascular, perivascular, intervascular) in different regions (basal, calvarial, tentorial, occipital, frontal, parietal, temporal) of the cranial meninges. Specimens of human dura mater were harvested from autopsies of 10 elderly male subjects (age range, 60 - 75 years). Dar were labeled with specific (H 3) markers, studied with radiobinding techniques (including liquid scintillation), stained for light microscope autoradiography, and measured by means of quantitative analysis of images. All results were evaluated with statistical analysis to identify significant results. More dural Dar were found in the basal region than in the calvarial one. Moreover, Dar are more abundant in the vascular and perivascular dural zone than in the intervascular one. The vascular distribution of Dar seemed to indicate that Dar {{play a role in the}} control of <b>meningeal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> The location and distribution of D 1 and D 2 receptors in the human cranial dura mater confirmed the presence of a dopaminergic system, which could play an important role in controlling blood flow and/or other functions of meningeal membranes...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of Neisseria meningitidis with the meninges that surround {{and protect the}} brain is a pivotal event in the progression of bacterial meningitis. Two models of the human meninges were established in vitro, using (i) sections of fresh human brain and (ii) cultures of viable cells grown from human meningiomas. Neisseria meningitidis showed a specific predilection for binding to the leptomeninges and <b>meningeal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in human brain {{and not to the}} cerebral cortex. There was a close correlation between the adherence of different Neisseria species to leptomeninges and cultured cells. The major ligand that mediated adherence was the pilus, and pilin variation modulated the interactions. The presence of Opa protein increased the association of Cap+ meningococci that expressed low-adhesive pili, but did not influence the association of high-adhesive pili. In contrast, Opc did not influence the adherence of Cap+ meningococci, whereas loss of capsule was associated with a more intimate interaction between the bacteria and the meningioma cell that was not apparent with Cap+ meningococci. There was no evidence of internalization of meningococci by meningioma cells in vitro, an observation that is consistent with the barrier properties of the leptomeninges to N. meningitidis observed in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Migraine {{headache}} pain {{is thought}} to result from an abnormal distention of intracranial, extracerebral <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> and the consequent activation of the trigeminal nervous system. Migraine is also often accompanied by extracranial sensory disturbances from facial tissues. These experiments investigate whether meningeal dilation produces central sensitization of neurones that receive convergent input from the face. Single unit extracellular activity was recorded from the trigeminal nucleus caudalis of anaesthetized rats in response to either noxious stimulation of the dura mater, innocuous stimulation of the vibrissae or to a transient dilation of the meningeal vascular bed. Rat α-CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide; 1 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) caused a dilation of the middle meningeal artery and facilitated vibrissal responses by 36 ± 7 %. The 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D agonist, L- 741, 604 (3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.), inhibited responses to noxious stimulation of the dura mater (16 ± 7 % of control) and, in a separate group of animals, blocked the CGRP-evoked facilitation of vibrissal responses. L- 741, 604 (3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) also inhibited responses to innocuous stimulation of the vibrissa (14 ± 10 % of control) with neurones that received convergent input from the face and from the dura mater, but not with cells that received input only from the face (70 ± 12 % of control). These data show that dilation of <b>meningeal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> causes a sensitization of central trigeminal neurones and a facilitation of facial sensory processing which was blocked by activation of pre-synaptic 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptors. Sustained dural <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> dilation during migraine may cause a sensitization of trigeminal neurones. This may underlie some of the symptoms of migraine, such as the headache pain and the extracranial allodynia. Inhibition of this central sensitization may therefore offer a novel strategy {{for the development of}} acute and/or prophylactic anti-migraine therapies...|$|R
40|$|Migraine {{headache}} {{is thought}} to be caused by a distension of <b>meningeal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> the activation of trigeminal sensory neurones and the the development of a central sensitization within the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC). It has been proposed that clinically effective 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D agonists act peripherally to inhibit the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and neurogenic dural vasodilation, and to attenuate nociceptive neurotransmission within the TNC. Since opioids are also effective anti-migraine agents the present studies investigated the role of opioids within the trigemino-vascular system in anaesthetised rats. Electrical stimulation of the dura mater evoked neurogenic dural vasodilation which was significantly inhibited by morphine (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) the selective μ-opioid agonist DAGO (10 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) and the mixed agonist/antagonist butorphanol (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) but not by the κ- and δ-opioid agonists (±) U 50488 H (100 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) and DPDPE (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1). Morphine had no effect on CGRP-evoked dural vasodilation. In electrophysiological studies morphine (1 [*]–[*] 10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) significantly attenuated brainstem neuronal activity in response to electrical stimulation of the dura by 65 % at 10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1. Morphine (3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) also inhibited the TNC neuronal sensitization following CGRP-evoked dilation. The present studies have demonstrated that opioids block the nociceptive neurotransmission within the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and in addition inhibit neurogenic dural vasodilation via an action on μ-opioid receptors located on trigeminal sensory fibres innervating dural <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> These peripheral and central actions {{are similar to those of}} the ‘triptan' 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D agonists and could account for the anti-migraine actions of opioids...|$|R

This work was carried {{during the period}} of two years in São Paulo State, Brazil. A total of 67 brain samples were examined and in 10. 4 % (five equines, one poney, and one donkey) were observed gross lesions of ELEM, confirmed by histopathological analysis. The animals were five males and two females ranged from 11 months to nine years old. The seven cases happened in all seasons of the year. The most characteristic clinical signs were incoordination, ataxia, paralysis of the hind legs, profound depression and death. Necropsy was performed to collect brain samples for virological and histopathological diagnosis. Gross lesions included congestion of <b>meningeal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> malacia of the white matter characterized by yellowish depressed areas sometimes hemorrhagic, with cavitations, and softening surrounded by hyperemic area. Microscopically, the lesions were liquefactive necrosis of the white matter brain, characterized by eosinophilic and amorphous material, axonal and perivascular edema, hemorrhage and vacuolization of the neuropil and axonal sferoids. Gitter cells were seen in some areas of malacia. Perivascular mononuclear cuffing was observed in only one case. The present study confirms that differential diagnosis is very important to distinguish equid neuropathies.

40|$|The {{propensity}} of {{canine distemper virus}} (CDV) to spread to {{the central nervous system}} is one of the primary features of distemper. Therefore, we developed a reverse genetics system based on the neurovirulent Snyder Hill (SH) strain of CDV (CDVSH) and show that this virus rapidly circumvents the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barriers to spread into the subarachnoid space to induce dramatic viral meningoencephalitis. The use of recombinant CDVSH(rCDVSH) expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or red fluorescent protein (dTomato) facilitated the sensitive pathological assessment of routes of virus spread in vivo. Infection of ferrets with these viruses led to the full spectrum of clinical signs typically associated with distemper in dogs during a rapid, fatal disease course of approximately 2 weeks. Comparison with the ferret-adapted CDV 5804 Pand the prototypic wild-type CDVR 252 showed that hematogenous infection of the choroid plexus is not a significant route of virus spread into the CSF. Instead, viral spread into the subarachnoid space in rCDVSH-infected animals was triggered by infection of vascular endothelial cells and the hematogenous spread of virus-infected leukocytes from <b>meningeal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> into the subarachnoid space. This resulted in widespread infection of cells of the pia and arachnoid mater of the leptomeninges over large areas of the cerebral hemispheres. The ability to sensitively assess the in vivo spread of a neurovirulent strain of CDV provides a novel model system to study the mechanisms of virus spread into the CSF and the pathogenesis of acute viral meningitis...|$|R

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al MCT 8 Symposium: "Current Knowledge, Future Research on Treatment", celebrado en California (USA) del 12 al 14 {{de enero}} de 2016. Histopathological data from MCT 8 -deficient human brains {{strongly}} suggest that brain hypothyroidism is an important pathophysiological condition involved {{in the development of}} the neurological signs and symptoms. Several therapeutic pharmacological strategies have been specifically developed for the treatment of MCT 8 -deficient patients but to date none has been effective in palliating and/or normalizing the neurological alterations of the patients. This fact along with previous studies with animal models {{strongly suggest that}} the replacement of the mutated gene by a normal one in the MCT 8 expressing cells, by means of gene therapy, could be a good approach to treat the neurological syndrome. For all these reasons, it is fundamental to know the spatial and temporal pattern of MCT 8 expression in the human brain. We have studied the prenatal brain expression of MCT 8 by immunohistochemistry in autopsy brain tissue from 14, 16, 20, 25, 30, 32 and 38 gestational weeks fetuses. Paraffin tissue sections were analyzed histologically by hematoxylin-eosin staining and by immunohistochemistry using specific polyclonal antibodies for MCT 8. MCT 8 is detected prenatally in all brain barrier structures (intraparenchymal and <b>meningeal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> leptomeningeal cells, choroid plexuses epithelial cells and ependymocytes and tanycytes at cerebral ventricles), and at the membrane of some neurons (including Cajal Retzius cells) and glial cells. Interestingly MCT 8 is expressed in radial glial processes in the cortical plate. Our data indicate a complex spatial and temporal expression pattern of MCT 8, probably due to important regulatory mechanisms involved in gene expression and protein processing. The significant and constant expression of MCT 8 in all the brain barriers points to the cells forming and participating in these barriers as the crucial targets for gene therapy to overcome MCT 8 -deficiency and brain hypothyroidism by improving the availability of thyroid hormones inside the human brain. We consider important to continue getting insight into MCT 8 brain expression by analyzing its normal expression at earlier stages in the developing human brain and also its subcellular localization in neural cells.

40|$|These studies {{investigated}} the pharmacology of neurogenic dural vasodilation in anaesthetized guinea-pigs. Following {{introduction of a}} closed cranial window the <b>meningeal</b> (dural) <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> were visualized using intravital microscopy and the diameter constantly measured using a video dimension analyser. Dural <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> were constricted with endothelin- 1 (3 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) prior to dilation of the dural <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP; 1 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) or local electrical stimulation (up to 300 [*]μA) of the dura mater. In guinea-pigs pre-treated with the CGRP receptor antagonist CGRP(8 - 37) (0. 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) the dilator response to electrical stimulation was inhibited by 85 % indicating an important role of CGRP in neurogenic dural vasodilation in this species. Neurogenic dural vasodilation was also blocked by the 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D agonist rizatriptan (100 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) with estimated plasma levels commensurate with concentrations required for anti-migraine efficacy in patients. Rizatriptan did not reverse the dural dilation evoked by CGRP indicating an action on presynaptic receptors located on trigeminal sensory fibres innervating dural <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> In addition, neurogenic dural vasodilation was also blocked by the selective 5 -HT 1 D agonist PNU- 142633 (100 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) but not by the 5 -HT 1 F agonist LY 334370 (3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) suggesting that rizatriptan blocks neurogenic vasodilation via an action on 5 -HT 1 D receptors located on perivascular trigeminal nerves to inhibit CGRP release. This mechanism may underlie one of the anti-migraine actions of the triptan class exemplified by rizatriptan and suggests that the guinea-pig is an appropriate species in which to investigate the pharmacology of neurogenic dural vasodilation...|$|R
40|$|An autopsy {{case of a}} 17 month-old male infant with {{stenosis}} of {{the arteries}} of the circle of Willis, due to intimal fibromuscular dysplasia, was presented. The child's suffering began with a sudden onset of clonic spasm of the face, fingers and limbs subsequently followed by hemiparesis at the left side 7 months after birth. Carotid angiograms disclosed stenosis of bilateral internal carotid arteries at the siphon portion and the cervical internal carotid artery to the left. No suggestion {{of the existence of}} cerebral arterial rete was seen. Symmetrical enlargement of the lateral ventricles was noted on PEG. Cerebrospinal fluid gave no abnormal values in cytological and biochemical examinations. Spastic episodes disappeared largely with antispastic drugs, but left hemiparesis persisted. One day prior to death, the patient's temperature rose remarkably and following general convulsion the patient died. The direct cause of death was acute purulent meningitis. Clinical examination detected coli bacilli septicemia. Autopsy revealed that besides meningitis purulenta, sclerosis of the brain was found in the parietotemporal region of both hemispheres which extended into the precentral and frontal gyri, but was found to be more diffuse and intense in distribution and degree at the right side, including entire involvement of the occipital lobe. <b>Meningeal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> were anemic in the sclerosing area, but otherwise intensively hyperemic, which was suggestive of constriction of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> entering into the sclerosed brain. Microscopically laminar or pseudolaminar necrosis of the cortex and demyelination and gliosis of the white matter were observed, whereas the basal ganglions were spared somewhat, only showing a slight degeneration. The internal capsule, crus cerebri and the corticopontine and corticospinal tracts were blanched. The bilateral distal portions of the internal carotid arteries, the bilateral middle and posterior cerebral arteries at the circle, and the hasilar artery were narrowed in decreasing order of intensity of intimal cushions or pads which consisted of proliferation of smooth muscle cells each encircled with collageneous and reticular fibers. Duplication and fragmentation of elastic fibers and the acidmucopolysaccharide metamorphosis of subendothelial ground substances were also apparent. A few fat granules and no disruption of internal elastic lamina were observed. The intimal thickening was considered to be caused by abnormal growth of cushions themseves which are found even in normal fetuses, infants and juveniles at the branching sites of the middlesized arteries such as the distal portion of the internal carotid artery, the middle cerebral artery and so on. This histological consideration might give a key to clarify the morphogenesis of spontaneous stenosis or occlusion of the arteries in the circle of Willis in “moyamoya” disease. The cause of the sclerotic lesion of the brain was attributable to the stenosis of the arteries in the distal portion of the internal carotid ateries and in the circle of Willis mentioned above, but other factors, for example, spastic constriction of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> may also contribute to the induction of the widespread lesion of the right hemisphere. The brain sclerosis might be related partly to spasm of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels...</b>|$|R
40|$|Meninges {{comprise}} {{three distinct}} layers, the dura mater, arachnoid, and pia mater {{that surround the}} brain, spinal cord and {{some parts of the}} nerves. Traditionally the meninges were believed to serve only as protection for tissues that they encase. However recent work shows they have other important functions related to development and regulation of the nervous system. Given the importance of the meninges, it is surprising that we know very little about their development. The embryological origin of the meninges has been debated for over a hundred years. Some studies imply that the meninges develop from the neural crest, while others suggest that they come from the somites. Here, we investigated the temporal development of meninges in birds and mice and found they form at comparable stages. We investigated the origin of avian spinal meninges using chick/quail cell tracing protocols and found they do not develop from the somites as previously thought. We propose that <b>meningeal</b> epithelial <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> may have been mistaken as meninges and led to an erroneous conclusion by previous investigators.

In some cases these lesions are of sufficient severity to account for dementia. In other cases the changes are less severe and are probably subclinical but may be a contributory factor to the development of cognitive impairment and dementia.

40|$|SUMMARY Raised {{levels of}} fibrin {{degradation}} products {{were found in}} the cerebrospinal fluid of nearly all of 35 patients with pneumococcal meningitis. The mean level was higher in patients who died subsequently than in those who survived. Cerebrospinal fluid from patients with pneumococcal meningitis showed increased fibrinolytic activity as assessed by clot lysis, suggest-ing local production of fibrin degradation products within the subarachnoid space. The mortality from pneumococcal meningitis re-mains high, especially in the tropics (Baird et al., 1976). In survivors, the illness is often protracted, and many patients are left with a permanent neurological deficit. The reasons for this high mortality and morbidity are unclear but vascular damage, occurring early {{in the course of the}} in-fection, may be an important factor. Postmortem studies (Cairns and Russell, 1946; Dickson and Yassin, 1969) have shown a severe vasculitis of <b>meningeal</b> and cerebral <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> with vessel wall oedema, necrosis, fibrin deposition and infil-tration with inflammatory cells. Changes of such severity are rarely seen in other types of pyogenic meningitis. We have tried to assess the possible importance of vasculitis in the pathogenesis of this condition by comparing levels of fibrin degradation products (FDP) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with pneumococcal or meningococcal meningitis.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <b>Meningeal</b> <b>blood</b> flow is {{controlled}} by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) released from trigeminal afferents and nitric oxide (NO) mainly produced in arterial endothelium. The vasodilatory effect of NO {{may be due to}} the NO sibling nitroxyl (HNO), generated through the reaction with hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S). We investigated the involvement of HNO in CGRP release and <b>meningeal</b> <b>blood</b> flow. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Blood flow in the exposed rat dura mater was recorded by laser Doppler flowmetry. CGRP release from the dura mater in the hemisected rat head was quantified using an ELISA. NO and H 2 S were localised histochemically with specific sensors. KEY RESULTS: Topical administration of the NO donor diethylamine-NONOate increased <b>meningeal</b> <b>blood</b> flow by 30 %. Preadministration of oxamic acid, an inhibitor of H 2 S synthesis, reduced this effect. Administration of Na 2 S increased the flow by 20 %. This effect was abolished by the CGRP receptor antagonist CGRP 8 - 37 or the TRPA 1 antagonist HC 030031 and reduced when endogenous NO synthesis was blocked. Na 2 S dose-dependently increased CGRP release 2 - 3 -fold. Co-administration of diethylamine-NONOate facilitated CGRP release, while inhibition of endogenous NO or H 2 S synthesis lowered basal CGRP release. NO and H 2 S were mainly localised in arterial vessels, HNO additionally in nerve fibre bundles. HNO staining was lost after the treatment with L-NMMA and oxamic acid. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: NO and H 2 S cooperatively increase <b>meningeal</b> <b>blood</b> flow by forming HNO, which activates TRPA 1 receptor channels of trigeminal fibres inducing CGRP release. The proposed role of the HNO-TRPA 1 -CGRP signalling for the pathophysiology of headaches is discussed...|$|R
30|$|Figure  6 {{demonstrates}} {{the advantage of}} using CLI for imaging <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> because CLI could not only image both tumor and non-tumor <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> {{but it could also}} measure the difference via attenuation of Cerenkov light. This study consistently showed higher light attenuation from <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in or on the tumor than <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> on the non-tumor side. Whereas typical subcutaneous <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> are 10 to 50  μm in diameter [28, 29], tumor <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> diameters can exceed 100  μm, which was the case for the mouse in Figure  7. The dilated tumor <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> attenuated more Cerenkov light than the non-dilated, non-tumor side <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> since Cerenkov light passes through more blood in the larger diameter <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> It was observed that tumor vessels attenuated approximately three times more light at 10 %[*]±[*] 4 % than the non-tumor side vessels at 3 %[*]±[*] 1 %. Qualitatively, the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> on the tumor side were much clearer and easier to delineate than the non-tumor side <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b>|$|R

50|$|In medicine, {{collateralization}}, also <b>vessel</b> collateralization and <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> collateralization, is {{the growth}} of a <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> or several <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> that serve the same end organ or vascular bed as another <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> that cannot adequately supply that end organ or vascular bed sufficiently.|$|R
30|$|Multiregional {{segmentation}} {{seems to}} be promising direction of the <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> modeling {{in a context of}} the <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> calcification. The proposed regional segmentation model is capable of distinguish physiological <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> area from areas of calcification spots. On the base of this procedure, we obtain a model reflecting whole <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> and second model reflecting only the calcifications. This <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> feature selection procedure serves as a solid basis for extraction parameters for objectification of the calcification amount.|$|R
40|$|Small fiber bundles {{from the}} {{extensor}} digitorum longus (EDL) muscle were transplanted into the hamster cheek pouch {{to observe the}} process of revascularization. We tested the hypothesis that <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> of a graft degenerate and that revascularization results from the ingrowth of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> from the cheek pouch into the graft. Degeneration and regeneration of muscle fibers followed a pattern similar to that reported for autografts of whole muscles in rats. <b>Blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in the graft that were adjacent to vascularized host tissue survived. At 1 day, surviving <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in the graft had normal structure but erythrocytes were packed tightly in the lumen. At 2 days, sprouts from surviving graft vessels had grown into the cheek pouch. Between 2 and 2. 5 days, anastomoses of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> from the graft {{with those of the}} cheek pouch reestablished circulation. After circulation was established, the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> contained well-spaced erythrocytes. By 3 days, <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> which increased in number and diameter throughout the graft occupied 40 - 60 % of the graft. Over the next 24 hr, <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in the graft regressed toward the control value. We conclude that <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in muscle grafts in the cheek pouch survive transplantation, and that circulation in grafts is reestablished by the anastomoses of <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> sprouts from the graft with the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> of the host...|$|R
30|$|The <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> {{calcification}} {{is absolutely}} important issue for a clinical diagnosis of <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> systems. The calcifications and other <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> diseases affecting the <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> permeability are commonly assessed by medical imaging modalities, {{such as the}} CT angiography. CT is capable to provide good images where physiological areas of the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> are distinguished from the calcifications under great contrast. Nevertheless, commonly used clinical SW allows for only imaging of the <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> system and some basic image adjustment such as contrast or brightness transformations. Thus, such systems lack of procedures which would allow for autonomous modeling and objectification of the calcification amount which would predict further disease development.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} the <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> density in twenty nonmetastatic and thirty-three metastatic gastric carcinomas was immunohistochemically determined. The <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> were {{detected}} with two antibodies. One of these reacts with CD 105 (Endoglin) {{and the other}} with CD 34, a cell surface glycoprotein. The number of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> was determined in three visual fields at x 200 magnification. In most cases the vessel density was higher within the tumour than in the tumour border. A dependence of <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> density on the histological type or the development of metastasis could not be found. In some cases the <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> density was additionally determined in ten visual fields. To indicate a trend of high or low <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> density the evaluation of three visual fields was found to be sufficient. The anti-CD 105 antibody marked tumour associated <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> better than the anti-CD 34 antibody.

40|$|The spatial {{patterns}} of diffuse, primitive and classic beta/A 4 deposits was studied {{in relation to}} <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in 24 cortical tissues from five elderly cases of Alzheimer's disease with pronounced congophilic angiopathy (CA). Beta/A 4 deposit subtypes and beta/A 4 stained <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> were clustered in the tissue. In many instances, the clusters of beta/A 4 deposits and <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> were regularly spaced along the cortical strip. Total beta/A 4 deposits were positively correlated with <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in five tissues only. Similarly, clusters of diffuse and primitive beta/A 4 subtypes were each positively correlated with <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in two brain regions. By contrast, clusters of classic beta/A 4 deposits were positively correlated with <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in 62 % of the cortical tissues examined. These results suggest that in patients with significant CA, initial deposition of beta/A 4 protein was unrelated to <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> However, clusters of classic beta/A 4 deposits {{appeared to be in}} phase with clusters of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> along the cortex...|$|R
40|$|The {{clustering}} {{pattern of}} diffuse, primitive and classic β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits was {{studied in the}} upper laminae of the frontal cortex of 9 patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ stained tissue was counterstained with collagen type IV antiserum {{to determine whether the}} clusters of Aβ deposits were related to <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> In all patients, Aβ deposits and <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> were clustered, with in many patients, a regular periodicity of clusters along the cortex parallel to the pia. The classic Aβ deposit clusters coincided with those of the larger <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in all patients and with clusters of smaller <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in 4 patients. Diffuse deposit clusters were related to <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in 3 patients. Primitive deposit clusters were either unrelated to or negatively correlated with the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in six patients. Hence, Aβ deposit subtypes differ in their relationship to <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> The data suggest a direct and specific role for the larger <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in the formation of amyloid cores in AD. © 1995...|$|R
