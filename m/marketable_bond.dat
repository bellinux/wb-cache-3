Recent developments that have enhanced the overall efficiency of the market are also examined. This article is part of a series that describes and analyses features of the Canadian financial sector. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{initiatives}} {{reviewed by}} the author were undertaken to ensure a liquid and well-functioning market for Government of Canada securities {{in light of the}} significant shift in the government's financial position. They include changes made in 1998 by the Bank of Canada and the government to the rules governing auctions and to the Bank's surveillance of the auction process, changes to the treasury bill and bond programs, and implementation of a pilot buyback program for Government of Canada <b>marketable</b> <b>bonds.</b> In addition, the Investment Dealers Association of Canada adopted a code of conduct for the secondary market. These initiatives were well received by the market and appear to have had a positive impact. The Bank and the government are, however, continuing their search for ways to maintain and enhance the efficiency of this market. ...|$|R
5000|$|On February 2, 2005, President George W. Bush made Social Security a {{prominent}} theme of his State of the Union Address. One consequence was increased public {{attention to the}} nature of the Social Security Trust Fund. Unlike a typical private pension plan, the Social Security Trust Fund does not hold any marketable assets to secure workers' paid-in contributions. Instead, it holds non-negotiable United States Treasury bonds and U.S. securities backed [...] "by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government". The trust funds have been invested primarily in non-marketable Treasury debt, first, because the Social Security Act prohibits [...] "prefunding" [...] by investment in equities or corporate bonds and, second, because of a general desire to avoid large swings in the Treasuries market that would otherwise result if Social Security invested large sums of payroll tax receipts in <b>marketable</b> government <b>bonds</b> or redeemed these <b>marketable</b> government <b>bonds</b> to pay benefits.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{applies the}} Qual VAR method {{developed}} recently by Dueker (2005) {{to search for}} the ideal macroeconomic indicator(s) that fully fit the in-sample movements of business cycle fluctuations and accurately predict the out-of-sample recession probability in Canada. Compared to previous works, I apply a more comprehensive dynamic forecasting model on the most updated Canadian macroeconomic dataset. The results are threefold: First, consistent with the findings by Estrella and Mishkin (1998), the term spread 1 between 10 -year and 3 -month <b>marketable</b> <b>bonds</b> on its own provides a reliable in-sample goodness of fit. Introducing additional leading financial variables, such as the bank rate and major stock market indices, does not entirely distort the forecasting performance of the term spread. Second, coupling the term spread with the US-Canada noon-spotted exchange rate gives us the best short-term out-of-sample forecasting power. Third, the combination of the term spread, exchange rate, and the growth rate of real GDP provides convincing recession prediction in longer horizons...|$|R
40|$|Prudential {{management}} of credit risk and supervisory requirements {{call for the}} accurate measurement of loss conditional upon default (LGD). In the case of banks, {{in order to achieve}} Advanced Internal Ratings Based (AIRB) compliance under the Basel II minimum regulatory capital framework, loss arising from counterparty default must be estimated. However, the discount rate to be applied to post-default cash flows is a largely unsettled issue, amongst both practitioners and bank supervisors. In this study we survey various methodologies extant in the literature for determining an appropriate discount rate. We propose an approach in which the discount rate is conditional upon the level or undiversifiable risk inherent in the recovery cash flows associated with defaulted facilities. We present a stylized theoretical framework for understanding such an approach. This is followed by an empirical exercise that utilizes a comprehensive and commercially available database of workout recoveries, in which we analyze the returns on <b>marketable</b> <b>bonds</b> and loans, having market prices at default and at the resolution of the default event. We propose alternative empirical measures of the recovery risk inherent in post-default cash-flows: the annualized simple return on defaulted debt (RDD) and th...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} how accelerating inflation has led households in different economic and demographic classes to reallocate their "transactable savings. " We use cross-section {{data from the}} 1962 and 1970 Surveys of Consumer Finances to estimate both the composition of accumulated household saving and prospective rates of return on this saving. We show that accelerating inflation has, {{in the presence of}} comprehensive ceilings on deposit interest rates, altered the savings incentives of different types of households. The effect has been to bias small savers toward leveraged investments in tangible assets (especially real estate) and large savers toward certificates of deposit and <b>marketable</b> <b>bonds.</b> Small savers with disadvantaged access to credit are simply victimized. Our analysis helps to explain a number of anomalous features of the 1975 - 1979 macroeconomic recovery, particularly the dominant role of consumer spending, the unprecedented expansion of household debt, the boom in housing and declining flows of household savings into deposit institutions. These data underscore the unintended consequences of trying to reconcile deposit-rate ceilings with accelerating inflation. This combination of policies unpleasantly distorts the sectoral composition of spending and risk-bearing (crowding out some productive business investment) and aggravates inequities in th...|$|R
40|$|How {{to account}} for {{interest}} on bonds in a system as integrated as the System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA) {{has been a source}} of much controversy. Two main positions emerge: the debtor treatment based on the contractual arrangements of the bonds; and the creditor treatment based on current interest rates and prices of assets/liabilities. Using the discounted cash flow model, this paper explores the treatment of income and other benefits from assets in the 1993 SNA. It finds that the debtor approach to bond interest conforms with the 1993 SNA recording income and other benefits from assets, as that approach captures the results of effective decision making between institutional units.

40|$|Zero-coupon {{interest}} rates are the fundamental building block of fixed-income mathematics, and as such have an extensive number of applications in both finance and economics. The risk-free government zero-coupon term structure is, however, not directly observable {{and needs to be}} generated from the prices of <b>marketable,</b> coupon-bearing <b>bonds.</b> The authors introduce the first public-domain database of constant-maturity zero-coupon yield curves for the Government of Canada bond market. They first outline the mechanics of the curve-fitting algorithm that underlie the model, and then perform some preliminary statistical analysis on the resulting yield curves. The full sample period extends from January 1986 to May 2003; it is broken down into two subsamples, reflecting the structural and macroeconomic changes that impacted the Canadian fixed-income markets over that time. The authors examine the evolution of a number of key {{interest rates}} and yield-curve measures over the period, perform a principal-components analysis of the common factors that have influenced yield changes over time, and compare holding-period returns over the sample for assets of various maturities.

40|$|In Indonesia, {{government}} made some restriction on investment of Pension Fund regulated {{in the decision}} by Minister of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia number 511 /KMK. 06 / 2002. The types of Pension Fund investment allowed, are term deposit, deposit certificates, stocks, <b>bonds,</b> other <b>marketable</b> securities, direct placement, promissory notes, lands and buildings, fund guards share units and Bank Indonesia certificates. During the period of 2001 - 2005, the pattern of investment placement performed by the Dana Pensiun PT. Pfizer Indonesia is in forms of term deposit, stocks in stock exchange, other <b>marketable</b> securities, <b>bonds</b> and lands and buildings. The performance of investment portfolio Dana Pensiun PT. Pfizer Indonesia in Indonesia economic condition for last 5 years is relatively good. This {{can be seen from}} over achievement return target every year of the Dana Pensiun PT. Pfizer Indonesia last 5 years. These were all attributable to the external factors that contributed to the investment climate. At the time, the analysis shows that the fields of investment that contribute to increase in income from investment are term of deposit, lands and buildings and bonds. Accordingly, {{the results of this study}} suggest that the management maximize future investment in the three fields, all with due observance of the prevailing laws and regulations and the present and future climates for investmen...|$|R
