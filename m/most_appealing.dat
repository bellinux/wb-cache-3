5|$|Flynn {{has divided}} film critics. While some reviewers enjoyed the character's {{refreshing}} humor, rebelliousness and sarcasm {{in comparison to}} traditional Disney princes, others found his personality to be annoying and obnoxious, while panning his narration. Additionally, Flynn has also been strongly {{accused of being a}} marketing tool exploited by Disney to attract a larger male audience to Tangled. However, both the character's romantic comedy-esque relationship with Rapunzel and Levi's vocal performance have received widespread acclaim. Flynn is also considered to be among the <b>most</b> <b>appealing</b> Disney heroes by Vanity Fair, E! and Cosmopolitan.|$|E
5|$|Life on Brook Farm {{was based}} on {{balancing}} labor and leisure while working together {{for the benefit of}} the greater community. Each member could choose to do whatever work they found <b>most</b> <b>appealing</b> and all were paid equally, including women. Revenue for the community came from farming and from selling handmade products like clothing as well as through fees paid by the many visitors to Brook Farm. The main source of income was the school, which was overseen by Mrs. Ripley. A pre-school, primary school, and a college preparatory school attracted children internationally and each child was charged for his or her education. Adult education was also offered.|$|E

5|$|Tulips {{grow from}} bulbs, {{and can be}} {{propagated}} through both seeds and buds. Seeds from a tulip will form a flowering bulb after 7–12 years. When a bulb grows into the flower, the original bulb will disappear, but a clone bulb forms in its place, as do several buds. Properly cultivated, these buds will become bulbs of their own. The mosaic virus spreads only through buds, not seeds, and so cultivating the <b>most</b> <b>appealing</b> varieties takes years. Propagation is greatly slowed down by the virus. In the Northern Hemisphere, tulips bloom in April and May for about one week. During the plant's dormant phase from (Northern Hemisphere) June to September, bulbs can be uprooted and moved about, so actual purchases (in the spot market) occurred during these months. During {{the rest of the}} year, florists, or tulip traders, signed contracts before a notary to buy tulips {{at the end of the}} season (effectively futures contracts). Thus the Dutch, who developed many of the techniques of modern finance, created a market for tulip bulbs, which were durable goods. Short selling was banned by an edict of 1610, which was reiterated or strengthened in 1621 and 1630, and again in 1636. Short sellers were not prosecuted under these edicts, but their contracts were deemed unenforceable.|$|E

25|$|The {{influential}} folklorist Cecil Sharp {{felt that}} these competing variants {{of a traditional}} song would undergo a process of improvement akin to biological natural selection: only those new variants that were the <b>most</b> <b>appealing</b> to ordinary singers would {{be picked up by}} others and transmitted onward in time. Thus, over time we would expect each traditional song to become aesthetically ever more appealing— it would be collectively composed to perfection, as it were, by the community.|$|E
25|$|One of the <b>most</b> <b>appealing</b> {{reasons for}} naming the Lake Superior agate as the Minnesota state {{gemstone}} is its general availability.

Lake Superior agates {{have been found in}} gravel deposits along the Mississippi River basin. Other types of agate similar to Lake Superior agate have been found in southwestern Wisconsin.|$|E

25|$|Despite Star Treks proven success, NBC and ABC only {{offered to}} {{consider}} pilot scripts {{for the new}} series, and CBS offered to air a miniseries that could become a series if it did well. That the Big Three television networks treated Paramount's <b>most</b> <b>appealing</b> and valuable property as they would any other series offended the studio. Fox wanted the show to help launch the new network, but wanted it by March 1987, and would only commit to 13 episodes instead of a full season. The unsuccessful negotiations convinced the studio that it could only protect Star Trek with full control.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of casting, William Schallert had just {{finished}} filming the ABC sitcom The Patty Duke Show. He described himself not as a fan, and had not read any science fiction since 1948. He thought {{that the role of}} Nilz Baris was just another guest spot, and the role of a [...] "rather stuffy bureaucrat... not the <b>most</b> <b>appealing</b> character". He did not remember the character's name, only recalling it when he first attended a Star Trek convention at a hotel near Los Angeles Airport, as the fans called it out when he entered the lobby.

Even China's Hu Jintao felt compelled to talk about democracy in the run-up to Beijing's Olympic Games." ...|$|R
50|$|Largely self-taught, his {{interest}} in old local architecture gems and nature were depicted in romantic realism. His early work explores local scenery, coastlines and idyllic landscape in the UAE. They were essentially realist {{but it is an}} extraordinary realism distilled by an exacting eye and a mystical imagination which gives his works much of its power. Not only does he capture the place, but also the sense of time, in a medium that is <b>most</b> expressive, <b>appealing</b> and challenging - watercolour.|$|R
5000|$|Described {{as one of}} the <b>most</b> {{dramatically}} <b>appealing</b> English operas, {{the opera}} in two acts has a prologue and sixteen scenes, each preceded by a variation on the twelve-note 'Screw' theme. Typically of Britten, the music mixes tonality and dissonance, with Britten's recurrent use of a twelve-tone figure being perhaps a nod to the approach of Arnold Schoenberg. Thematically, the play gives a central role to a line borrowed from W. B. Yeats' poem [...] "The Second Coming": [...] "The ceremony of innocence is drowned." ...|$|R
