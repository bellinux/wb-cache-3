5|$|The {{longitudinal}} (or linear) dunes {{were initially}} {{presumed to be}} formed by moderately variable winds that either follow one mean direction or alternate between two different directions. Subsequent observations indicate that the dunes point to the east although climate simulations indicate Titan's surface winds blow toward the west. At less than 1 meter per second, they are not powerful enough to lift and transport surface material. Recent computer simulations indicate that the dunes {{may be the result}} of rare storm winds that happen only every fifteen years when Titan is in equinox. These storms produce strong downdrafts, flowing eastward at up to 10 <b>meters</b> <b>per</b> second when they reach the surface.|$|E

Hence {{it is important}} to understand the factors that determine this drilling metric. In this study we analyse the effect of drilling depth on <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> day. There are various physical and technical characteristics that enhance and decrease <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> day as drilling depth increases. Factors that reduce <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> day are present at depths way above depths of high pressure and high temperature.

40|$|The {{influences}} of {{photosynthetically active radiation}} (PAR) and water status on nocturnal Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) were quantitatively examined for a widely cultivated cactus, Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Miller. When the total daily PAR was maintained at 10 moles photons <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> day but the instantaneous PAR level varied, the rate of nocturnal H+ accumulation (tissue acidification) became 90 % saturated near 700 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second, a PAR level typical for similar light saturation of C 3 photosynthesis. The total nocturnal H+ accumulation and CO 2 uptake reached 90 % of maximum for a total daily PAR of about 22 moles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> day. Light compensation occurred near 0 moles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> day for nocturnal H+ accumulation and 4 moles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> day for CO 2 uptake. Above a total daily PAR of 36 moles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> day or for an instantaneous PAR of 1150 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second for more than 6 hours, the nocturnal H+ accumulation actually decreased. This inhibition, which occurred at PAR levels just above those occurring in the field, {{was accompanied by a}} substantial decrease in chlorophyll content over a 1 -week period...|$|R
5|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of heliumII {{is greater than}} that of any other known substance, a million times that of heliumI and several hundred times that of copper. This is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional quantum mechanism. Most materials that conduct heat well have a valence band of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat. HeliumII has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well. The flow of heat is governed by equations that are similar to the wave equation used to characterize sound propagation in air. When heat is introduced, it moves at 20 <b>meters</b> <b>per</b> second at 1.8K through heliumII as waves in a phenomenon known as second sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{property}} that makes neurons unique is {{their ability to}} send signals to specific target cells over long distances. They send these signals {{by means of an}} axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a pyramidal cell, (an excitatory neuron) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than a kilometer. These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 <b>meters</b> <b>per</b> second. Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials.|$|E

40|$|The {{growth and}} tuberization of {{potatoes}} (Solanum tuberosum L.) maintained for 6 weeks under four different regimes of continuous irradiance {{were compared to}} plants given 12 hours light and 12 hours dark. Treatments included: (a) continuous photosynthetic photon flux of 200 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second cool-white fluorescent (CWF); (b) continuous 400 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second CWF; (c) 12 hours 400 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second CWF plus 12 hours dim CWF at 5 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second; (d) 12 hours [400] micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second CWF plus 12 hours dim incandescent (INC) at 5 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second and a control treatment of 12 hours light at 400 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second CWF and 12 hours dark. The study included five cultivars ranging from early- to late-season types: 'Norland,' 'Superior,''Norchip,' 'Russet Burbank,' and 'Kennebec,' Tuber development progressed well under continuous irradiation at 400 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second and under 12 hours irradiance and 12 hours dark, while tuber development was suppressed in all other light treatments. Continuous irradiation at 200 or 400 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second resulted in severe stunting and leaf malformation on 'Superior' and 'Kennebec' plants, but little or no injury and vigorous shoot growth in the other cultivars. No injury or stunting were apparent under 12 -dim light or 12 -dark treatments. Plants given 12 hours dim INC showed significantly greater stem elongation but less total biomass than plants in other treatments. The continuous light encouraged shoot growth over tuber growth but this trend was overridden by providing a high irradiance level. The variation among cultivars for tolerance to continuous lighting indicates that potato may be a useful species for photoinhibition studies...|$|R

40|$|A double {{pressure}} probe {{technique was}} used to measure simultaneously water flows and hydraulic parameters of individual cells and of excised roots of young seedlings of maize (Zea mays L.) in osmotic experiments. By following initial flows of water at the cell and root level and by estimating the profiles of driving forces (water potentials) across the root, the hydraulic conductivity of individual cell layers was evaluated. Since the hydraulic conductivity of the cell-to-cell path was determined separately, the hydraulic conductivity of the cell wall material could be evaluated as well (Lpcw = 0. 3 to 6. 10 − 9 <b>per</b> <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second per megapascal). Although, for radial water flow across the cortex and rhizodermis, the apoplasmic path was predominant, the contribution of the hydraulic conductance of the cell-to-cell path to the overall conductance increased significantly from the first layer of the cortex toward the inner layers from 2 % to 23 %. This change was mainly due to an increase of the hydraulic conductivity of the cell membranes which was Lp = 1. 9. 10 − 7 <b>per</b> <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second per megapascal in the first layer and Lp = 14 to 9. 10 − 7 <b>per</b> <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second per megapascal in the inner layers of the cortex. The hydraulic conductivity of entire roots depended on whether hydrostatic or osmotic forces were used to induce water flows. Hydrostatic Lpr was 1. 2 to 2. 3. 10 − 7 <b>per</b> <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second per megapascal and osmotic Lpr = 1. 6 to 2. 8. 10 − 8 <b>per</b> <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second per megapascal. The apparent reflection coefficients of root cells (σs) of nonpermeating solutes (KCI, PEG 6000) decreased from values close to unity in the rhizodermis to about 0. 7 to 0. 8 in the cortex. In all cases, however, σs was significantly larger than the reflection coefficient of entire roots (σsr). For KCI and PEG 6000, σsr was 0. 53 and 0. 64, respectively. The results are discussed in terms of a composite membrane model of the root...|$|R

40|$|Kalanchoë daigremontiana, {{a species}} {{possessing}} crassulacean acid metabolism, was grown at four photon flux densities (1300, 400, 60, and 25 micromole photons <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second). In leaves which had developed at 1300 and 400 micromole photons <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second, CO 2 was mainly incorporated through the lower, shaded leaf surfaces, and the chlorenchyma {{adjacent to the}} lower surfaces showed {{a higher degree of}} nocturnal acid synthesis than the chlorenchyma adjacent to the upper surfaces. In leaves acclimated to 60 and 25 micromole photons <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second, the gradient in CAM activity was reversed, i. e. more CO 2 was taken up through the upper than through the lower surfaces and nocturnal acidification was higher in the tissue next to the upper surfaces. Total net carbon gain and total nocturnal acid synthesis were highest in leaves which had developed at 400 micromole photons <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second. Chlorophyll content was markedly reduced in leaves which had developed at 1300 micromole photons <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second, especially in the exposed adaxial parts. There was also a sustained reduction in photosystem II photochemical efficiency as indicated by measurements of the ratio of variable over maximum chlorophyll a fluorescence. These findings suggest that, at high growth photon flux densities, the reduced activity of the exposed portions of these succulent leaves is caused by (a) the adverse effects of excess light, (b) together with a genotypic component which favors CO 2 uptake and acid synthesis in the abaxial (lower) leaf parts even when light is not or only marginally excessive. This latter component is predominant at medium photon flux densities, e. g. at 400 micromole photons <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second. It becomes overridden, however, under conditions of deep shade when strongly reduced light levels in the abaxial parts of the leaf chlorenchyma severely limit photosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|Stomatal conductances of {{normally}} oriented and inverted {{leaves were}} measured as light levels (photosynthetic photon flux densities) were increased {{to determine whether}} abaxial stomata of Vicia faba leaves were more sensitive to light than adaxial stomata. Light levels were increased over uniform populations of leaves of plants grown in an environmental chamber. Adaxial stomata of inverted leaves reached maximum water vapor conductances at a light level of 60 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second, the same light level at which abaxial stomata of normally oriented leaves reached maximum conductances. Abaxial stomata of inverted leaves reached maximum conductances at a light level of 500 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second, the same light level at which adaxial stomata of normally oriented leaves reached maximum conductances. Maximum conductances in both normally oriented and inverted leaves were about 200 millimoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second for adaxial stomata and 330 millimoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second for abaxial stomata. Regardless of whether leaves were normally oriented or inverted, when light levels were increased to values high enough that upper leaf surfaces reached maximum conductances (about 500 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second), light levels incident on lower, shaded leaf surfaces were just sufficient (about 60 micromoles <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> <b>per</b> second) for stomata of those surfaces to reach maximum conductances. This `coordinated' stomatal opening on the separate epidermes resulted in total leaf conductances for normally oriented and inverted leaves that were the same at any given light level. We conclude that stomata in abaxial epidermes of intact Vicia leaves are not more sensitive to light than those in adaxial epidermes, and that stomata in leaves of this plant {{do not respond to}} light alone. Additional factors in bulk leaf tissue probably produce coordinated stomatal opening on upper and lower leaf epidermes to optimally meet photosynthetic requirements of the whole leaf for CO 2...|$|R
