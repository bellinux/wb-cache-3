Study design: : Forty-four women presenting to a tertiary hospital in South Africa with severe pre-eclampsia between 28 and 34 weeks' gestation were managed expectantly for at least 8 days. We measured maternal <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> every 30 min with the pregnancy validated Spacelabs 90209 automated <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitor for 24 h periods on alternative days. The mean 24 -h diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurement, the <b>mean</b> diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> for daytime and nighttime, the day-night <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> difference and the night-day ratio were compared with the occurrence of abruptio placentae, gestational age at delivery, neonatal intensive care unit admission, birth weight, abnormal umbilical artery Doppler FVW and reason for delivery.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Atrial {{fibrillation}} and hypertension are {{two common}} {{conditions in the}} elderly, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Little information is available regarding the epidemiology of hypertension in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A secondary analysis of data from the Birmingham Atrial Fibrillation Treatment of the Aged study, a randomised controlled trial of thrombo-prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation in a primary care population. The study population comprised patients aged 75 and over with electrocardiogram (ECG) confirmed atrial fibrillation. <b>Blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was recorded in the general practice surgery on two occasions using standardised methods. History of hypertension was sought from the medical records and from asking the patient. RESULTS: 3059 subjects had ECG confirmed atrial fibrillation. The prevalence {{of a history of}} hypertension in this group was 57. 5 %. The <b>mean</b> systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was 141 mmHg (standard deviation: 21 mmHg) in men and 144 mmHg (22 mmHg) in women. The <b>mean</b> diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was 79 mmHg (12 mmHg) in men and 80 mmHg in women (12 mmHg). The <b>mean</b> systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was slightly lower than that of the general population aged 75 and over, but the <b>mean</b> diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was significantly higher in patients in atrial fibrillation (by 8 mmHg). Among the patients with a diagnosis of hypertension, 86. 5 % were on <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> lowering medications. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension is more commonly diagnosed in older patients with atrial fibrillation than in the general population. The <b>mean</b> systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> is slightly lower, but the <b>mean</b> diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> substantially higher in older patients in atrial fibrillation, compared to the general population...|$|R

50|$|Digital meters employ oscillometric {{measurements}} and electronic calculations rather than auscultation. They may use manual or automatic inflation, but both types are electronic, easy to operate without training, {{and can be}} used in noisy environments. They measure systolic and diastolic pressures by oscillometric detection, employing either deformable membranes that are measured using differential capacitance, or differential piezoresistance, and they include a microprocessor. They accurately measure <b>mean</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and pulse rate, while systolic and diastolic pressures are obtained less accurately than with manual meters, and calibration is also a concern. Digital oscillometric monitors may not be advisable for some patients, such as those suffering from arteriosclerosis, arrhythmia, preeclampsia, pulsus alternans, and pulsus paradoxus, as their calculations may not correct for these conditions, and in these cases, an analog sphygmomanometer is preferable when used by a trained person. Digital instruments may use a cuff placed, in order of accuracy and inverse order of portability and convenience, around the upper arm, the wrist, or a finger. The oscillometric method of detection used gives blood pressure readings that differ from those determined by auscultation, and vary according to many factors, such as pulse pressure, heart rate and arterial stiffness, although some instruments are claimed also to measure arterial stiffness, and some can detect irregular heartbeats.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with calcium antagonism in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria. DESIGN [...] Randomised study of diabetic patients with microalbuminuria treated with perindopril or nifedipine for 12 months and monitored for one or three months after stopping treatment depending on whether they were hypertensive or normotensive. Patients were randomised separately according to whether they were hypertensive or normotensive. SETTING [...] Diabetic clinics in three university teaching hospitals. PATIENTS [...] 50 diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria. In all, 43 completed the study: 30 were normotensive and 13 hypertensive; 19 had type I diabetes and 24 had type II diabetes. INTERVENTIONS [...] For 12 months 20 patients were given perindopril 2 - 8 mg daily and 23 were given nifedipine 20 - 80 mg daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Albumin excretion rate, blood pressure, and glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS [...] Both perindopril and nifedipine significantly reduced <b>mean</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> During treatment {{there was no significant}} difference between those treated with perindopril and those treated with nifedipine with respect to albuminuria or <b>mean</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> Stopping treatment with both drugs was associated with a sustained increase in albuminuria and <b>mean</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> There was a significant correlation between <b>mean</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and albuminuria and also between the reduction in <b>mean</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and the decrease in albuminuria during treatment with both drugs. In hypertensive patients both drugs caused significant decreases in <b>mean</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and albuminuria. In normotensive patients there was no significant reduction in albuminuria with either regimen. CONCLUSIONS [...] In diabetic patients with microalbuminuria blood pressure seems to be an important determinant of urinary albumin excretion. Perindopril and nifedipine have similar effects on urinary albumin excretion, both preventing increases in albuminuria in normotensive patients and decreasing albuminuria in hypertensive patients...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess in {{conscious}} two-kidney, one clip renal hypertensive rats whether {{angiotensin converting}} enzyme (ACE) inhibition with lisinopril, angiotensin II receptor blockade with losartan or vasodilation with sodium nitroprusside have similar effects on intra-arterial <b>mean</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> heart rate and splanchnic nerve activity. RESULTS: A bolus dose of lisinopril or losartan (both 10 mg/kg, intravenously) induced within 2 h an equal reduction in <b>mean</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> whereas sodium nitroprusside infused {{during the same period}} (at 10 micrograms/min) lowered <b>mean</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> but less strongly. The heart rate was accelerated significantly more during sodium nitroprusside infusion than during lisinopril or losartan treatment. Splanchnic nerve activity increased significantly only in those rats given sodium nitroprusside. No change in the parameters studied was observed in vehicle-treated rats. The doses of lisinopril and losartan were repeated after 12 and 24 h. Before administration of the last dose, the <b>mean</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was still low. Administration of lisinopril or losartan again 24 h after the initial dose had no further effect on the <b>mean</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> heart rate or splanchnic nerve activity. CONCLUSION: These results obtained in rats with a renin-dependent form of hypertension show that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system for 24 h produces an equivalent blood pressure reduction irrespective of whether it is due to ACE inhibition or angiotensin II antagonism. The results also indicate that there is less reflex activation of sympathetic nerve activity when blood pressure is lowered with a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system rather than with a direct vasodilator such as sodium nitroprusside...|$|E

The correlation between BPV and mRS was further analyzed by terciles of clinically informative stratifications. Results. Two hundred and fifteen patients met inclusion criteria.

BackgroundMineralocorticoid hormones, which maintain electrolyte {{balance and}} <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> {{are thought to}} be associated not only with the expression of renal 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11 β-HSD 2), but also with that of intracellular mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs). The present study was designed to test whether the mineralocorticoid action of glucocorticoid corticosterone on renal MR is involved in the development of diabetes-associated hypertension by measuring the alterations of renal 11 β-HSD 2. MethodWe measured the <b>mean</b> systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> renal 11 β-HSD 1, and mRNA levels in streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic rats that received spironolactone, insulin, or no treatment, and in nondiabetic controls that received spironolactone. ResultsFour weeks after an injection of STZ, the renal 11 β-HSD 2 and mRNA levels were significantly lower in diabetic rats than in control rats, and the <b>mean</b> systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was 14. 8 % higher in diabetic rats than in controls. Subcutaneous injections of spironolactone into diabetic rats for three weeks partially reversed the decrease in renal 11 β-HSD 2 activity and gene expression, and prevented the <b>mean</b> systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> elevation. Spironolactone treatment for one week also resulted in a significant reduction in <b>mean</b> systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> during the development of diabetic hypertension. However, treatment with STZ did not significantly decrease the renal 11 β-HSD 1 activity and mRNA expression, and spironolactone treatment did not exert a significant effect on this enzyme in STZ-induced diabetic rats. ConclusionIn the development of diabetes-induced hypertension, the effect of spironolactone on <b>mean</b> systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> may be associated with the mineralocorticoid effects of corticosterone on renal MR, as well as an alteration of renal 11 β-HSD 2 activity and its mRNA expression in insulin-dependent diabetic rats...|$|R
