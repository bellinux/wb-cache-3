50|$|Recovery is {{a process}} by which {{deformed}} grains can reduce their stored energy by the removal or rearrangement of defects in their crystal structure. These defects, primarily dislocations, are introduced by plastic deformation of the material and act to increase the yield strength of a material.

As a result, recovery may be considered beneficial or detrimental depending on the circumstances. Recovery {{is related to the}} similar process of recrystallization and grain growth. Recovery competes with recrystallization, as both are driven by the stored energy, but is also thought to be a necessary prerequisite for the nucleation of recrystallized grains. It is so called because there is a recovery of the electrical conductivity due to a reduction in dislocations. This creates defect-free channels, giving electrons an increased mean-free path.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{study the}} effects of loading paths and stress states on rock {{strength}} and deformation, marble specimens were axially compressed to various displacements under a confining pressure (CP) firstly, and then the damaged specimens were recompressed under another CP. The bearing capacity of a marble specimen depends merely on CP at the stage of ductile deformation, and it has no relation with the loading history when CP keeps constant or increases. However, the damaged specimen turns into brittle when it is recompressed uniaxially or at a lower CP, and the Young’s modulus and strength are lower than those of a dense specimen. The increasing ratio of triaxial strength to CP has a close relation with the areas of fissures in the damaged specimens but not the internal friction angle. <b>Material</b> <b>strength</b> and bearing capacity are two different conceptions for rocks. <b>Material</b> <b>strength</b> decreases continually as the plastic deformation increases; however, the bearing capacity is determined by both the stress state and the <b>material</b> <b>strength...</b>|$|R
