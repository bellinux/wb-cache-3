30|$|Fractional pilot reuse method {{introduces}} {{an extra}} pilot overhead {{to reduce the}} pilot contamination. Generally, this method can be classified into two categories. The first divides the cells into two groups. The cells in the same group are assigned with the same pilot sequences, but those in different cells are assigned with the orthogonal pilot sequences in order to mitigate the pilot contamination [18, 19]. The second category divides the users into two groups according to different levels of pilot contamination, namely the center users who suffer from the <b>modest</b> <b>pilot</b> contamination and the edge users who suffer from severe pilot contamination. A cell-center pilot group is reused for all cell-center users, while a cell-edge pilot group is applied for the edge users in the adjacent cells [20]. This method improves the quality of service (QoS) of the edge users {{at the cost of}} a slight rate loss of the center users.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The <b>Pilot</b> <b>library</b> {{offers a}} new method for program-ming {{parallel}} clusters in C. Formal elements from Communi-cating Sequential Processes (CSP) were used to realize a process/channel model of parallel computation that reduces opportunities for deadlock and other communication errors. This simple model, plus an application programming interface (API) fashioned on C’s formatted I/O, are designed to make the library easy for novice scientific C programmers to learn. Optional runtime services including deadlock detection help the programmer to debug communication issues. Pilot forms a thin layer on top of standard Message Passing Interface (MPI), pre-serving the latter’s portability and efficiency, with little perfor-mance impact. MPI’s powerful collective operations can still be accessed within the conceptual model. Keywords—MPI; library; parallel programming; deadlock detection; CSP I...|$|R

Through in vitro high-throughput screening with the Colorado Center for Drug Discovery (C 2 D 2) <b>Pilot</b> <b>Library,</b> we identified hit compound 1, which {{was the basis for}} extensive structure−activity relationship studies.

With further studies of its inhibitory mechanisms, we demonstrated that 103 carries out this inhibition through the JAK/STAT 1 pathway, providing a drug-like small molecule inflammation suppressant for possible therapeutic uses.

40|$|The users at {{cell edge}} of a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system suffer from severe pilot contamination, which leads to poor quality of service (QoS). In order to enhance the QoS for these edge users, soft pilot reuse (SPR) {{combined}} with multi-cell block diagonalization (MBD) precoding are proposed. Specifically, the users are {{divided into two groups}} according to their large-scale fading coefficients, referred to as the center users, who only suffer from <b>modest</b> <b>pilot</b> contamination and the edge users, who suffer from severe pilot contamination. Based on this distinction, the SPR scheme is proposed for improving the QoS for the edge users, whereby a cell-center pilot group is reused for all cell-center users in all cells, while a cell-edge pilot group is applied for the edge users in the adjacent cells. By extending the classical block diagonalization precoding to a multi-cell scenario, the MBD precoding scheme projects the downlink transmit signal onto the null space of the subspace spanned by the inter-cell channels of the edge users in adjacent cells. Thus, the inter-cell interference contaminating the edge users' signals in the adjacent cells can be efficiently mitigated and hence the QoS of these edge users can be further enhanced. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that both the uplink and downlink rates of the edge users are significantly improved, albeit at the cost of the slightly decreased rate of center users.

40|$|Finding unique {{peptides}} {{to target}} specific biological surfaces {{is crucial to}} basic research and technology development, though methods based on biological arrays or large libraries limit the speed and ease with which these necessary compounds can be found. We reasoned that because biological surfaces, such as cell surfaces, mineralized tissues, and various extracellular matrices have unique molecular compositions, they present unique physicochemical signatures to the surrounding medium which could be probed by peptides with appropriately corresponding physicochemical properties. To test this hypothesis, a naïve <b>pilot</b> <b>library</b> of 36 peptides, varying in their hydrophobicity and charge, was arranged in a two-dimensional matrix and screened against various biological surfaces. While the number of peptides in the matrix library was very small, we obtained "hits" against all biological surfaces probed. Sequence refinement of the "hits" led to peptides with markedly higher specificity and binding activity against screened biological surfaces. Genetic studies revealed that peptide binding to bacteria was mediated, {{at least in some}} cases, by specific cell-surface molecules, while examination of human tooth sections showed that this method can be used to derive peptides with highly specific binding to human tissue...|$|R

The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this comprehensive exercise approach for chronic whiplash. Methods/Design A multicentre randomised controlled trial will be conducted. One hundred and seventy-six participants with chronic grade I to II whiplash will be recruited in Sydney and Brisbane, Australia. All participants will receive an educational booklet on whiplash and in addition, those randomised to the comprehensive exercise group (specific motor relearning and graded activity exercises) will receive 20 progressive and individually-tailored, 1 hour exercise sessions over a 12 week period (specific motor relearning exercises: 8 sessions over 4 weeks; graded activity: 12 sessions over 8 weeks). The primary outcome to be assessed is pain intensity. Other outcomes of interest include disability, health-related quality of life and health service utilisation. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 14 weeks, 6 months and 12 months by an assessor who is blinded to the group allocation of the subjects. Recruitment is due to commence in late 2009. Discussion The successful completion of this trial will provide evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a simple treatment for the management of chronic whiplash.

40|$|Shortly after {{drafting}} a research proposal in 2005 {{to investigate the}} potential of library blogs in Western Australia, I was offered numerous library employments opportunities. This paper describes how the research proposal subsequently evolved into a brand-new working project after I experienced {{the potential of the}} blog first-hand at different libraries as a new graduate Rome wasn’t built in a day and rarely does an idea materialise overnight.

40|$|AbstractThirteen CCS {{projects}} {{involving the}} capture and/or storage {{of carbon dioxide}} in Australia are currently proposed or underway. The projects range in maturity from Australia’s first storage project (the CO 2 CRC Otway Project) and the CSIRO Loy Yang PCC Pilot Project which are already underway, to projects which {{are unlikely to be}} fully operational until 2015 or later. They range in scale from relatively <b>modest</b> <b>pilot</b> scale capture projects (Munmorah, Hazelwood, CO 2 CRC H 3, Mulgrave, Loy Yang), to commercially significant rates of CO 2 storage of 10 – 50, 000 tonnes CO 2 per annum (Callide Oxyfuel, Otway) to proposals for medium scale injection of up to 500, 000 tonnes CO 2 per annum (ZeroGen, Coolimba), 3 – 4 million tonnes per annum for the Gorgon LNG Project and up to 10 million tonnes of CO 2 per annum for the Monash (coal to liquids) Project. It is encouraging to see this high level of interest in CCS in Australia. At the same time it has to be recognised that most of these projects have not advanced beyond the feasibility scale at this time and not all of them will prove to be commercially or environmentally viable. Additionally, several of the existing CCS projects have been at the feasibility stage for several years and the slow rate of progress is a concern given the importance of CCS deployment to Australia. Australia is seen as one of the leaders in the demonstration and deployment of CCS, with billions of dollars committed to CCS by industry and governments over the next 5 – 10 years. Nonetheless, it is important to examine ways of further accelerating the large-scale deployment of CCS by resolving outstanding issues including financial, liability and other questions which may be impeding progress...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of predominant microbial taxa with specific metabolic capabilities remains one {{the biggest challenges}} in environmental microbiology, because {{of the limits of}} current metagenomic and cell culturing methods. We report results from the direct analysis of multiple genes in individual marine bacteria cells, demonstrating the potential for high-throughput metabolic assignment of yet-uncultured taxa. The protocol uses high-speed fluorescence-activated cell sorting, whole-genome multiple displacement amplification (MDA), and subsequent PCR screening. A <b>pilot</b> <b>library</b> of 11 single amplified genomes (SAGs) was constructed from Gulf of Maine bacterioplankton as proof of concept. The library consisted of five flavobacteria, one sphingobacterium, four alphaproteobacteria, and one gammaproteobacterium. Most of the SAGs, apart from alphaproteobacteria, were phylogenetically distant from existing isolates, with 88 – 97 % identity in the 16 S rRNA gene sequence. Thus, single-cell MDA provided access to the genomic material of numerically dominant but yet-uncultured taxonomic groups. Two of five flavobacteria in the SAG library contained proteorhodopsin genes, suggesting that flavobacteria are among the major carriers of this photometabolic system. The pufM and nasA genes were detected in some 100 -cell MDA products but not in SAGs, demonstrating that organisms containing bacteriochlorophyll and assimilative nitrate reductase constituted < 1 % of the sampled bacterioplankton. Compared with metagenomics, the power of our approach lies in the ability to detect metabolic genes in uncultured microorganisms directly, even when the metabolic and phylogenetic markers are located far apart on the chromosome...|$|R
