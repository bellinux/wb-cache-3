La unidad {{experimental}} estuvo constituida por bolsas de polietileno con dos kilos de suelo seco al aire, utilizando el horizonte Ap. El diseño experimental fue completamente al azar, el diseño de tratamientos fueron dos factoriales entrelazados con dos tratamientos adicionales, testigo absoluto (To), testigo comercial (Te). Este llevó fertilización basal con N, P, K, y doce tratamientos con fertilización basal más S (N, P, K +S). Al período de floración se cuantificó peso de materia seca, peso de nódulos, % S, % N Y N/S, a final de cosecha se determinó en el grano de soya % S, % N, N/ S, número de vainas, de granos, peso seco de grano y % de aceite. Los tres suelos respondieron a la fertilización de S. La fuente que presentó diferencias significativas con mayor incremento en producción de grano de soya, fue el azufre micronizado, en la dosis de 20 kg S/ha aplicado con anterioridad a la siembra. In {{order to}} fertilize, four sources of sulphur, ammonicum sulfate, gyppum, sulfuric acid and <b>micronized</b> <b>sulphur,</b> were used. Sulphur dose of 20 and 40 kg per hectare were applied before sowing {{and at the}} seeding moment, on three soils orders (Vertisol, Inceptisol and Entisol) of the geographic Valley of the Cauca river, with the soybeam variety ICA Tunía. The experimental units were made of polyethilen bags with two kilograms of air dry soil, using the Ap. horizon. The experimental design was completyly ramdom. The treatment designs were two factorial s interlaced with two additional treatments, absolute indicator (To) commercial indicator (Te). This carried basal fertilization with N, P, K and twelve treatments with basal fertilization plus sulphur (N, P, K + S). At flowering stage, the dry mather weight, nodules weight, % S, % N, and N/S, were mesured. At harvest time, % S, % N, N/S, amount of pods, grain, dry weight of grain and oil percentaje were determined. The soil orders showed good response to fertilization with sulphur. The source that presented significant differences with a highest increase in production of grain was the <b>micronized</b> <b>sulphur</b> with dose of 20 kg S/hectare, applied before sowing...|$|E

Journal of Plant Nutrition, 30,(1), 67 - 77. During the year 1999, two field experiments (Experiments 1 and 2) were {{conducted at the}} University of Wales Aberystwyth U. K., to investigate the effects of soil and foliar applied sulphur (S) in wheat, {{in terms of its}} potential as a growth regulator and to compare the effects with that of commercial growth regulators, chlormequat (CC) and gibberellic acid (GA 3). Foliar S (Thiovit 80 % S) was applied to the spring wheat variety Axona at Zadoks growth stage (GS) 23 (tillering) in experiment 1, and at GS 30 and 32 (stem extension) in experiment 2. Treatments applied at GS 23 were: untreated control, <b>micronized</b> <b>sulphur</b> (Thiovit, 80 % sulphur) at 10 kg/ha and 20 kg/ha, chlormequat (CC) at 2. 5 L/ha and gibberellic acid (GA 3) at 75 g/ha. Treatments applied in experiment 2 at GS 30 and 32 were similar apart from GA 3, which was not included. In experiment 1 (applications at GS 23), grain yield was unaffected by the treatments applied, although both S and CC appeared {{to increase the number of}} ears at maturity. The internode lengths and the main stem-lengths were not affected with S application. In contrast, CC applications reduced all but the basal internode lengths, while GA 3 application increased internode lengths and overall stem length. In experiment 2 (applications at GS 30 and 32), the grain yield was again unaffected by S or CC. However, the stem length was reduced and the unit stem weight was increased following the application of S, though not to the same magnitude as with CC, and S at 20 kg/ha was more effective than S at 10 kg/ha. It was concluded that S, when applied at tillering (GS 23) in spring wheat, did not show potential as a growth regulator. However, when applied at the beginning of stem extension (GS 30 and 32), it did show potential to reduce the stem length and thereby increase the crops resistance to lodging. This is of particular relevance for use in low input, sustainable, and organic wheat production systems where the use of artificial plant growth regulators is discouraged or forbidden. Here, the use of foliar applied S as a potential stem shortener, coupled with its recognized fungicidal properties, make it an attractive and acceptable input. Peer reviewe...|$|E
