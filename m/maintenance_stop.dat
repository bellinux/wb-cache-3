40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a conceptual framework}} for the generation of activity and travel patterns {{in the context of}} more general structures and presents an integrated model system as a step toward development of an improved travel demand forecasting model system. We propose a two-stage structure to model activity and travel behavior. The first stage, the stop generation and stop/auto allocation models, consists of the choices for the number of household <b>maintenance</b> <b>stops</b> and the allocation of stops and autos to household members. The second stage, the tour formation model, includes the choices for the number of tours and the assignment of stops to tours for each individual, conditional on the choices in the first stage. Empirical results demonstrate that individual and household socio-demographics are important factors affecting the first stage choices, the generation of <b>maintenance</b> <b>stops</b> and the allocation of stops and autos among household members, and the second stage choices, the number of tours and the assignment of stops to tours.

West Chicago was originally known as Junction, as three railroads crossed through it. The Galena and Chicago Union Railroad erected the first railway station in the town in 1849, and in five years' time, the town was an important railway <b>maintenance</b> <b>stop.</b> Working on steam engines and railway cars at the time induced a great fire hazard, {{but there was no}} city services to fight the blazes. All fire control was ineffectively provided by private companies. In 1883, the village, now known as Turner, approved the construction of a Town Hall. Aside from its town safety functions, the hall also provided a meeting place for citizens of the village and hosted a local museum. Fire protection was officially added in 1888. The town hall maintained its functions until 1976 when it was re-designated the West Chicago City Museum. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.|$|E

40|$|Structural {{airframe}} {{maintenance is}} {{a subset of}} aircraft maintenance, which is often performed at scheduled intervals to detect and repair cracks that would otherwise affect {{the safety of the}} aircraft. With the progress of structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques, which uses on-board sensors and actuators to assess damage status, condition-based maintenance (CBM) is considered as an alternative to traditional scheduled maintenance. By applying SHM techniques, CBM can access damages status as frequently as needed and unscheduled maintenance can be asked once the damage exceeds a particular threshold. Due to the harsh working environment and sensor limitation, the measurement data acquired from SHM is often quite noisy. In this paper, Extended Kalman filter is used to filer the noise to provide an accurate estimation of crack size and crack growth parameters together with their associated uncertainty. This knowledge is used to obtain a probabilistic estimate of the remaining useful service life of the structure. Based on these estimates, two maintenance philosophies are developed and further compared in terms of <b>maintenance</b> <b>stop</b> number or replaced panel number. The results indicate that both these two strategies reduce considerably the <b>maintenance</b> <b>stop</b> number compared to scheduled maintenance...|$|E

Moreover a genetic algorithm is developed to support the criterion evaluation and to significantly reduce the computation tim...|$|E

50|$|Dieselisation {{took place}} {{largely because of}} the {{tremendous}} reduction in operating costs it allowed. Steam locomotives require large pools of labour to clean, load, maintain and run. They also require extensive service, coaling and watering facilities. This was their biggest inferior measure as compared to the diesel locomotive in the number of ton-miles or passenger traffic miles either could run. Diesels could and did have a significantly higher initial price per unit-horsepower delivered. However, their far greater range between fueling stops, the absence of water stops, and the much higher unit availability between inspection repair and <b>maintenance</b> <b>stops,</b> were orders of magnitude better than steam. Diesels simply required significantly less time and labour to operate and maintain. Initially, diesel locomotives were less powerful than the largest steam locomotives, limiting train sizes or speeds, although the gap was closed somewhat by the introduction of larger diesel-electric locomotives such as the Deltic class. Electric locomotives can be vastly more powerful than either steam or diesel ones.|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this case study is to {{identify}} and develop maintenance performance indicators (MPIs) for a mineral processing plant producing high quality iron ore pellets, as well as studying and analyzing the short plant <b>stops</b> and planned <b>maintenance</b> <b>stops.</b> Design/methodology/approach - An action research approach was adopted for this study, with interactive process of interviews. The existing MPIs are analyzed {{and a set of}} MPIs are developed to measure the performance of balling area of the pelletization plant, where the effect of shorter stops in the process have been studied, analyzed and measured, and linked to the management's objectives. The utility of the MPIs are tested and validated within the framework of a multi-criterion and hierarchical maintenance performance measurement (MPM) framework. The plant stop data of the plant were collected and analyzed for MPIs and for maintenance decision making. Some other criteria were also considered from a holistic, integrated and balanced viewpoint in the model. Findings - This study resulted in identifying a set of MPIs for the operational level of the pelletization plant of LKAB, after analyzing the short plant <b>stops</b> and planned <b>maintenance</b> <b>stops</b> data, and the stakeholders' requirements. This study has identified nine MPIs at operational level or shop floor level that describe the status of plant {{and at the same time}} facilitates linking of plant performance with corporate strategy. Practical implications - The approach used in the paper to study, analyze and develop MPIs, can be useful for plant managers and asset owners to select and develop MPIs that can describe the health status of their plant and asset and that also can be linked to the corporate strategy. The framework used to verify the multi-criteria hierarchical framework can also be used by similar asset managers and infrastructure owners. This study has also lifted the impact of short duration stoppages, thus highlighting the total influence in terms of reduced life length, quality and productivity. This approach can be used by plant engineers, asset managers and infrastructure owners to assess the performance of maintenance process. Originality/value - This paper presents an approach for identifying MPIs relevant to the plant status and facilitating measuring maintenance performance at corporate level in a structured way.

40|$|Airframe {{maintenance}} is traditionally performed at scheduled maintenance stops. The decision {{to repair a}} fuselage panel {{is based on a}} fixed crack size threshold, which allows to ensure the aircraft safety until the next scheduled <b>maintenance</b> <b>stop.</b> With progress in sensor technology and data processing techniques, structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are increasingly being considered in the aviation industry. SHM systems track the aircraft health state continuously, leading to the possibility of planning maintenance based on an actual state of aircraft rather than on a fixed schedule. This paper builds upon a model-based prognostics framework that the authors developed in their previous work, which couples the Extended Kalman filter (EKF) with a first-order perturbation (FOP) method. By using the information given by this prognostics method, a novel cost driven predictive maintenance (CDPM) policy is proposed, which ensures the aircraft safety while minimizing the maintenance cost. The proposed policy is formally derived based on the trade-off between probabilities of occurrence of scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. A numerical case study simulating the maintenance process of an entire fleet of aircrafts is implemented. Under the condition of assuring the same safety level, the CDPM is compared in terms of cost with two other maintenance policies: scheduled maintenance and threshold based SHM maintenance. The comparison results show CDPM could lead to significant cost savings...|$|E
2500|$|Venice's {{wealth and}} power rested {{in its ability to}} control trade in the Mediterranean. This would not have been {{possible}} without an extremely large navy and merchant force. By 1450, over 3,000 Venetian merchant ships were in operation, both as supply ships for Venetian merchants and as warships for the Venetian navy. The fleet required constant maintenance and outfitting. The Venetian Arsenal was not only able to function as a major shipyard, but was also responsible for these routine <b>maintenance</b> <b>stops</b> that most Venetian galleys required. This required financing, for which the Venetian government spent almost 10% of its revenues. This naval power resulted in the domination of Mediterranean commerce. Venice's leading families, largely merchants and nobleman, were responsible for creating some of the grandest palaces and employing some of the most famous artists ever known.

40|$|AbstractEvery CO 2 {{capture and}} storage chain will contain {{injection}} wells. The most important common operations for wells are shut-ins and depressurizations for reservoir characterization, <b>maintenance</b> <b>stops</b> {{and testing of}} valves. The aim of this work is firstly to demonstrate the need for experiments on these operations. Secondly, a new experimental set-up is proposed for such experiments. The main conclusion from this paper is that the physical phenomena during shut-ins and depressurizations of CO 2 injection wells can be described with models, but that {{that there are still}} some uncertainties left. The largest uncertainties occur when the transient flow is rapid and/or CO 2 is mixed with water. The proposed experimental set-up consists of a well with casing to be drilled vertically 200 - 250 meter at the Statoil laboratory in Trondheim, Norway. A U-tube with two legs with different diameter will be suspended in the well. Moreover, water or brine can be added for observing the effects of the H 2 O-CO 2 interaction. The U-tube is to be linked to the existing CO 2 transport test facility, which has the necessary vessels, compressor and pump. This rig will hopefully contribute in making CO 2 injection wells even safer and more cost efficient...|$|R
