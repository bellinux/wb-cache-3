500|$|While {{playing the}} game, an {{extended}} guitar neck is shown vertically {{on the screen}} (the frets horizontal), often called the [...] "note highway", and as the song progresses, colored markers or [...] "gems" [...] indicating notes travel down the screen {{in time with the}} music; the note colors and positions match those of the five fret keys on the guitar controller. Once the note(s) reach the bottom, the player must play the indicated note(s) by holding down the correct fret button(s) and hitting the strumming bar in order to score points. Success or failure will cause the on-screen Rock Meter to change, showing how well the player is playing (denoted by red, yellow, and green sections). Should the Rock <b>Meter</b> <b>drop</b> below the red section, the song will automatically end, with the player booed off the stage by the audience. Successful note hits will add to the player's score, and by hitting a long series of consecutive successful note hits, the player can increase their score multiplier. There is a window of time for hitting each note, similar to other rhythm games such as Dance Dance Revolution, but unlike these games, scoring in Guitar Hero is not affected by accuracy; as long as the note is hit within that window, the player receives the same number of points.|$|E
500|$|The primary single-player game mode is Career mode, {{which can}} be played on the lead guitar, bass guitar, drums, or vocals. Career mode has been {{slightly}} altered from previous Guitar Hero games. [...] After creating a band, selecting or creating an avatar, and then selecting an instrument, the player is then presented with one of several gigs containing two to five songs each. Most gigs end with an encore song that is not revealed until the other songs are completed. Two of the lead guitar gigs feature [...] "boss challenges" [...] with Zakk Wylde and Ted Nugent; these boss challenges, featuring original songs by Wylde and Nugent, are different from s boss battle, removing the focus on attack power-ups and instead featuring a call-and-response mechanic similar to the existing Face-Off mode. The gigs are arranged by difficulty based on the selected instrument. The player is awarded in-game money for each song completed, and completing each gig can also award additional money for meeting certain criteria, such as never letting the Rock <b>Meter</b> <b>drop</b> below a certain level or playing the first several notes of a song perfectly. [...] Completing a gig can also unlock one or more gigs with more difficult songs to complete. [...] Additional awards, such as customization items, are also awarded for completing gigs.

5000|$|Cook is {{a proponent}} of rolling stocks (stocks that {{regularly}} vacillate between [...] "predictable" [...] highs and lows) and has been very vocal about stock splits being {{a good way to}} make money, claiming that many stocks rose post split (since the end of the 1990s bull market, Cook has not been as strong {{a proponent of}} this concept). One of his more famous phrases was <b>meter</b> <b>drop.</b> Cook said that as a cab driver he learned that money was made every time the meter dropped, and that it was better to take many small fares rather than one big one. This translated to Cook's short-term investment strategy of buying and selling many stocks for smaller, quicker profits rather than buying and holding securities for an extended period in the hope that they will increase greatly. He charged US$5,695 per person for [...] "Wall Street Workshops" [...] that were offered across the United States.|$|E
50|$|Olsson and Graneheim reached Everest's peak on 16 May 2006. The pair then skied {{into the}} North Face by the Norton Couloir, a 55 degree steep and nearly 3000 meter high {{mountain}} face. North Col (North Face) Route {{is one of}} the most difficult of all the difficult routes to the top of the mountain. On May 16, 2006, after a full day of climbing, the two met up on the mountain and reached the summit. Exhausted, they wondered if they had the strength to ski down. Undeterred by their fatigue, they set off on skis down the North Face via the Norton Couloir at angles as steep as 60 degrees and a sheer 3,000 <b>meter</b> <b>drop.</b> Unfortunately, just as they set off, and after only skiing down the North Face approximately 1,500 feet, one of Olsson’s skis broke, adding extra tension to the already complex task. They tried to repair the ski with tape. A cliff intersecting the couloir forced the two to make an abseil. A snow anchor failed and Olsson fell an estimated 2500 meters to his death. Granheim skied alone to the North Col.|$|E
5000|$|Shown {{prominently}} {{in most of}} the Care Bears movies and TV episodes made in the 80s, the Caring Meter is typically in the dead center of Care-a-lot inside the Care Bears' main meeting hall. This meter shows how much caring there is both in Care-a-lot and on Earth. In the 1980s movies/cartoons, it is shown as an un-numbered clock-like meter. In The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie, the meter is shown with a raincloud (less caring) side and a rainbow (more caring) side. Ideally, the Caring Meter should be all the way towards the rainbow side. Whenever the Bears see the <b>meter</b> <b>drop</b> towards the raincloud side, they try to prevent it from getting worse by going on [...] "caring missions" [...] to try to get more people to care or for the Bears themselves to do caring deeds. If the meter drops near zero, Care-a-lot will suffer disasters, such as thunderstorms, buildings and rainbows crumbling (earlier movies) or the bright colors of Care-a-lot gradually turning into black and white (later movies). If the meter were to reach all the way to zero (there is no caring anywhere), then Care-a-lot would be gone forever.|$|E

50|$|Geraldes & Netto (2004a; b), Silveira et al. (2005) and Valente et al. (2005) {{concluded}} that the trachyte of this area {{was made up of}} lava flows which covered the erosion surface of the syenitic rock. If so, the trachyte must be younger than the syenite. However, field observation of the contact outcrops demonstrated that the trachyte intrudes into the metamorphic syenite, forming an intrusive body older than the syenite (Motoki et al., 2007a). Geraldes & Netto (2004a; b), Silveira et al. (2005) and Valente et al. (2005) considered that the trachyte is distributed only along the valley of the crater in a strip 2 kilometers long and less than 100 meters thick. This body has a horizontal extension larger than 15 kilometers and stretches from the base {{to the top of the}} Mendanha massif, with more than an 800 <b>meter</b> <b>drop</b> in elevation (Motoki et al., 2007a). Valente et al. (2005) show isolated occurrences of hexagonal fractures as evidence of trachyte lava flow. The trachyte does not have the characteristics of lava flow and lava dome (Motoki et al., 2007a). The hexagonal fractures were identified to be horizontal columnar joints of trachyte dike. These geological observations indicate that the trachyte is an intrusive body, being the oldest body of the felsic alkaline magmatism of this area, and is clearly different from the lava flows overlying the eroded surface of the syenite.|$|E

The cooling rate obtained in the drop tubes is lower than cooling rates in atomization and splat-quenching processes. Decoupling the rapid solidification process allows the study of the effects of undercooling and recalescence on alloy morphologies. The research therefore has a three-fold purpose.
