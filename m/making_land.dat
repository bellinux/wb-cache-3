5|$|Modern Scotland is {{half the}} size of England and Wales in area, but with its many inlets, islands and inland lochs, it has roughly the same amount of {{coastline}} at 4,000 miles. Only a fifth of Scotland is less than 60 metres above sea level. Its east Atlantic position means that it has very heavy rainfall, today about 700cm per year in the east and more than 1,000cm in the west. This encouraged the spread of blanket peat bog, the acidity of which, combined with high levels of wind and salt spray, made most of the islands treeless. The existence of hills, mountains, quicksands and marshes made internal communication and conquest extremely difficult and {{may have contributed to the}} fragmented nature of political power. The early Middle Ages was a period of climate deterioration, with a drop in temperature and an increase in rainfall, resulting in more land becoming unproductive. This was reversed in the period c. 1150 to 1300, with warm dry summers and less severe winters allowing cultivation at much greater heights above sea level and <b>making</b> <b>land</b> more productive. In the late Middle Ages, average temperatures began to reduce again, with cooler and wetter conditions limiting the extent of arable agriculture, particularly in the Highlands.|$|E

25|$|The {{submarine}} {{could be}} armed with either two TIIIc torpedoes with neutral buoyancy (achieved {{by limiting the}} number of batteries on board), mines, or a mixture of the two.

25|$|Before Alta California {{became a}} part of the Mexican state, about 30 Spanish land grants had already been deeded in all of Alta California to a few friends and family of the Alta California Governors. The 1824 Mexican Colony Law {{established}} rules for petitioning for land grants in California; and by 1828, the rules for establishing land grants were codified in the Mexican Reglamento (Regulation).

Councillors are elected to two-year terms and there is no limit on the number of terms an individual can serve. Boston uses a strong-mayor form of government in which the city council acts as a check against the power of the executive branch, the mayor.

25|$|Following {{the failure}} of {{diplomacy}} in the United Nations and persisted Dutch efforts to prepare the West Papuans for self-rule, Indonesia's Confrontation against the Dutch in West New Guinea reached a new crescendo. On 19 December 1961, President Sukarno gave orders for the Indonesian military {{to prepare for a}} full–scale military invasion of the territory; codenamed Operation Trikora. He also ordered the creation of a special People's Triple Command or Tri Komando Rakyat (Trikora) with the objective of 'liberating' West New Guinea by 1 January 1963. Trikora's operational command was to be called the Mandala Command for the Liberation of West Irian (Komando Mandala Pembebasan Irian Barat) and was led by Major-General Suharto, the future President of Indonesia. In preparation for the planned invasion, the Mandala command began <b>making</b> <b>land,</b> air, and sea incursions into West Irian. General Suharto also planned to launch a full-scale amphibious operation invasion of West Irian known as Operation Jayawijaya (or Operation Djajawidjaja).|$|E

[...] The colony had previously governed this territory (roughly the land between the Piscataqua and Kennebec Rivers {{in what is now}} southwestern Maine), but its right to do so had been stripped by King Charles after protests by the heirs of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, who had long-standing claims to the area. [...] Agents for Massachusetts then purchased the territory from the Gorges heirs, and Danforth was appointed to administer it. [...] The territory had been devastated and many properties abandoned during King Philip's War, and Danforth acted in effect as a Lord Proprietor, <b>making</b> <b>land</b> grants and reestablishing towns such as Falmouth and North Yarmouth.

In his 1933 book Game Management, Leopold defined the science of wildlife management as [...] "the art of <b>making</b> <b>land</b> produce sustained annual crops of wild game for recreational use," [...] but as Curt Meine has pointed out, he also viewed it as a technique for restoring and maintaining diversity in the environment.|$|E

2500|$|The {{government}} settled some 3,500 Black Loyalists in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, {{but they}} faced discrimination and inadequate support. Delays in <b>making</b> <b>land</b> grants aggravated racist tensions in Shelburne. Mobs of white Loyalists attacked Black Loyalists in the Shelburne Riots in July 1784, Canada's first recorded race riot. The government {{was slow to}} survey the land of Black Loyalists (which meant they could not settle); it also was discriminatory in granting them smaller, poorer and more remote lands than those of white settlers. This increased their difficulties in getting established. The majority of Black Loyalists in Canada were refugees from the South; they suffered from the harsh winters and discrimination.|$|E

2500|$|The action {{which brought}} about the {{decision}} had been led by Eddie Mabo, David Passi and James Rice, all from the Meriam people (from the Mer islands (Murray Island as referred to by the Commonwealth) in the Torres Strait). They commenced proceedings in the High Court in 1982, {{in response to the}} Queensland Amendment Act 1982 establishing a system of <b>making</b> <b>land</b> grants on trust for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, which the Mer Islanders refused to accept. The plaintiffs were represented by Ron Castan, Bryan Keon-Cohen and Greg McIntyre. It followed a conference at James Cook University called Land Rights and Future Australian Race Relations, organised by the Townsville chapter of the Aboriginal Treaty Committee and co-chaired by Eddie Mabo and Professor Noel Loos. Melbourne barrister Barbara Hocking delivered a paper at that conference entitled [...] "Is Might Right? An Argument for the Recognition of Traditional Aboriginal Title to Land in the Australian Courts". Hocking argued that a case should be taken to the High Court of Australia in pursuit of the recognition of native title in Australian common law. Specifically, that the High Court be asked to determine whether indigenous Australians had a [...] "just and legal" [...] claim to their lands, to overturn the specious notion of terra nullius (embedded in Australian law since the Privy Council decision in Cooper v Stuart in 1889) and {{that it was time for}} the common law to be [...] "put to rights".|$|E
