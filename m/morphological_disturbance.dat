40|$|We {{have carried}} out a {{systematic}} search for recoiling supermassive black holes (rSMBH) using the Chandra Source and SDSS Cross Matched Catalog. From the survey, we have detected a potential rSMBH, 'CXO J 101527. 2 + 625911 ' at z= 0. 3504. The CXO J 101527. 2 + 625911 has a spatially offset (1. 26 ± 0. 05 kpc) active SMBH and kinematically offset broad emission lines (175 ± 25 km s^ - 1 relative to systemic velocity). The observed spatial and velocity offsets suggest this galaxy could be a rSMBH, {{but we also have}} considered a possibility of dual SMBH scenario. The column density towards the galaxy center was found to be Compton thin, but no X-ray source was detected. The non-detection of the X-ray source in the nucleus suggests either there is no obscured actively accreting SMBH, or there exists an SMBH but has a low accretion rate (i. e. low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN)). The possibility of the LLAGN was investigated and found to be unlikely based on the Hα luminosity, radio power, and kinematic arguments. This, along with the null detection of X-ray source in the nucleus supports our hypothesis that the CXO J 101527. 2 + 625911 is a rSMBH. Our GALFIT analysis shows the host galaxy to be a bulge-dominated elliptical. The weak <b>morphological</b> <b>disturbance</b> and small spatial and velocity offsets suggest that CXO J 101527. 2 + 625911 could be in the final stage of merging process and about to turn into a normal elliptical galaxy.

40|$|Using wide {{baseline}} broad-band photometry, we analyse {{the stellar}} population properties {{of a sample}} of 72 galaxies, spanning {{a wide range of}} stellar masses and morphological types, in the nearby spiral-rich and dynamically young galaxy cluster Abell 1367. The sample galaxies are distributed from the cluster centre out to approximately half the cluster Abell radius. The optical/near-infrared colours are compared with simple stellar population synthesis models from which the luminosity-weighted stellar population ages and metallicities are determined. The locus of the colours of elliptical galaxies traces a sequence of varying metallicity at a narrow range of luminosity-weighted stellar ages. Lenticular galaxies in the red sequence, however, exhibit a substantial spread of luminosity-weighted stellar metallicities and ages. For red sequence lenticular galaxies and blue cloud galaxies, low mass galaxies tend to be on average dominated by stellar populations of younger luminosity-weighted ages. Sample galaxies exhibit a strong correlation between integrated stellar mass and luminosity-weighted stellar metallicity. Galaxies with signs of <b>morphological</b> <b>disturbance</b> and ongoing star formation activity, tend to be underabundant with respect to passive galaxies in the red sequence of comparable stellar masses. We argue that this could be due to tidally-driven gas flows toward the star-forming regions, carrying less enriched gas and diluting the pre-existing gas to produce younger stellar populations with lower metallicities than would be obtained prior to the interaction. Finally, we find no statistically significant evidence for changes in the luminosity-weighted ages and metallicities for either red sequence or blue cloud galaxies, at fixed stellar mass, with location within the cluster.

40|$|Williams {{syndrome}} (WS) is rare genetic form {{of mental}} retardation {{caused by a}} micro-deletion on chromosome 7 q 11. 23 that causes cognitive impairment {{and a variety of}} physical abnormalities. MRI studies of WS have demonstrated a series of brain abnormalities, including decreased brain size, with a relatively greater decrease in the volume of the cerebral white matter volume as compared to the cerebral gray matter. Moreover there is evidence that the posterior cerebrum is more affected in that persons with WS have a greater ratio of frontal to posterior regional volume. These findings are further supported by automated analyses that have shown reduced gray matter density in the superior parietal lobe areas. Functional MRI studies have demonstrated hypofunction immediately adjacent to, and anterior to, the intraparietal sulcus, a region in which structural brain differences had been identified. These anatomical and functional differences are consistent with the neuropsychological profile of WS - in particular, with evidence of dorsal stream visual processing deficits. To date, however, studies have always been performed in comparison to intellectually average controls. it is not clear, therefore, if findings are specific to the WS population or whether they represent a <b>morphological</b> <b>disturbance</b> characteristic of mental retardation, irrespective of genetic etiology. in this article, we reviewed recent advances underlying the structural and functional neural substrate of WS in Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE; 1997 - 2007).

We calculate the H I deficiency and find that the expected global trend for the H I deficiency of these spirals to increase with projected proximity to the cluster core, seen in clusters like Coma and Virgo, is not observed. We classified the spirals into four evolutionary states, with the galaxies in each state sharing a similar degree of H I deficiency and optical colour. The common characteristics of the spirals in each evolutionary state suggests they have been subject to similar environmental processes. Many of the spirals in the most common evolutionary state (moderate H I deficiency and blue colour) have an H I intensity maximum which is displaced relative to its optical counterpart.

In this study, 36 hydrographical basins, tributaries of Tiber River, have been analysed. A preliminary qualitative geomorphological setting was outlined pointing out that the drainage river network shows meaningful evidence of tectonic control, such as abrupt changes in stream directions, knickpoints and steepness anomalies alignments along meaningful length in adjacent basins. Besides, the tectonic control is well marked in base level changes and consequent tectonically induced downcutting. Signs of neotectonics are highlighted by structural landforms too. The entrenchment of alluvial fans, the triangular facets and the fault planes are mapped by field survey and aerial photo interpretation. In addition, a quantitative analysis was also performed.

40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{distinguishing}} between possible physical mechanisms acting on galaxies when they fall into clusters, we study {{the properties of the}} gas and the stars in a sample of 422 emission-line galaxies from EDisCS in different environments up to z~ 1. We identify galaxies with kinematical disturbances (from emission-lines in their 2 D spectra) and find that they are more frequent in clusters than in the field. The fraction of kinematically-disturbed galaxies increases with cluster velocity dispersion and decreases with distance from the cluster centre, but remains constant with projected galaxy density. We also studied <b>morphological</b> <b>disturbances</b> in the stellar light from HST/F 814 W images, finding that the fraction of morphologically disturbed galaxies is similar in all environments. Moreover, there is little correlation between the presence of kinematically-disturbed gas and morphological distortions. We also study the dependence of the Tully-Fisher relation, star formation, and extent of the emission on environment, and conclude that the gas disks in cluster galaxies have been truncated, and therefore their star formation is more concentrated than in low-density environments. If spirals transform into S 0 s, our findings imply that the physical mechanism transforming cluster galaxies efficiently disturbs the star-forming gas and reduces their specific star formation rate. Moreover, this star-forming gas is either removed more efficiently from the outskirts of the galaxies or is driven towards the centre (or both), helping to build the bulges of S 0 s. These results, in addition to the finding that the transformation mechanism does not seem to induce strong <b>morphological</b> <b>disturbances</b> on the galaxies, suggest that the physical processes involved are related to the intracluster medium, with galaxy-galaxy interactions playing only a limited role in clusters.

The high-quality observations presented here show {{for the first time}} that the overall majority of PRGs at intermediate redshifts (78 - 85 per cent) show peculiarities in their optical morphologies at relatively high levels of surface brightness (;). The observed morphological peculiarities include tails, fans, bridges, shells, dust lanes, irregular features, amorphous haloes and multiple nuclei. While the results for many of the galaxies are consistent with them being observed at, or after, the time of coalescence of the nuclei in a galaxy merger, we find that more than one-third of the sample are observed in a pre-coalescence phase of the merger, or following a close encounter between galaxies that will not necessarily lead to a merger. By dividing the sample into Weak-Line Radio Galaxies (WLRGs; 11 objects) and Strong-Line Radio Galaxies (SLRGs; 35 objects) we find that only 27 per cent of the former show clear evidence for interactions in their optical morphologies, in contrast to the SLRGs, of which at least 94 per cent appear interacting. This is consistent with the idea that many WLRGs are fuelled/triggered by the Bondi accretion of hot gas. However, the evidence for interactions and dust features in a fraction of them indicates that the accretion of cold gas cannot always be ruled out. Of the 28 per cent of the sample that display evidence for significant starburst activity, we find that 92 per cent present disturbed morphologies, following the same general trend as the total and SLRG samples.

Of the sample, 58 clusters that have adequately sensitive radio information were used to obtain the most accurate occurrence fractions so far. The occurrence of radio halos in our X-ray selected sample is ~ 22 %, that of mini-halos is 13 % and that of relics is ~ 5 %. The radio power - X-ray luminosity diagrams for the radio halos and mini-halos with the detections and upper limits are presented. The morphological estimators namely, centroid shift (w), concentration parameter (c) and power ratios (P_ 3 /P_ 0) derived from the Chandra X-ray images are used as proxies for the dynamical states of the GRHS+EGRHS clusters. The clusters with radio halos and mini-halos occupy distinct quadrants in the c-w, c-P_ 3 /P_ 0 and w - P_ 3 /P_ 0 planes, corresponding to the more and less <b>morphological</b> <b>disturbance,</b> respectively. The non-detections span both the quadrants. Comment: 24 pages, 5 tables, 25 figures, accepted for publication in A&...|$|E
40|$|Aims. We study galaxy pair samples {{selected}} from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-DR 7) and we perform an analysis of minor and major mergers {{with the aim of}} investigating the dependence of galaxy properties on interactions. Methods. We build a galaxy pair catalog requiring r(p) < 25 kpc h(- 1) and Delta V < 350 km s(- 1) within redshift z < 0. 1. By visual inspection of SDSS images we remove false identifications and we classify the interactions into three categories: pairs undergoing merging, M; pairs with evident tidal features, T; and non disturbed, N. We also divide the pair sample into minor and major interactions according to the luminosity ratio of the galaxy members. We study star formation activity through colors, the 4000 angstrom break, and star formation rates. Results. We find that similar to 10 % of the pairs are classified as M. These systems show an excess of young stellar populations as inferred from the D-n(4000) spectral index, colors, and star formation rates of the member galaxies, an effect which we argue {{is directly related to the}} ongoing merging process. We find similar to 30 % of the pairs exhibiting tidal features (T pairs) with member galaxies showing evidence of old stellar populations. This can be associated either to the disruptive effect of some tidal interactions, or to the longer time-scale of <b>morphological</b> <b>disturbance</b> with respect to the bursts of the tidal induced star formation. Regardless of the color distribution, we find a prominent blue peak in the strongest mergers, while pairs with tidal signs under a minor merger show a strong red peak. Therefore, our results show that galaxy interactions are important in driving the evolution of galaxy bimodality. By adding stellar masses and star formation rates of the two members of the pairs, we explore the global efficiency of star formation of the pairs as a whole. We find that, at a given total stellar mass, major mergers are significantly more efficient (a factor approximate to 2) in forming new stars, with respect to both minor mergers or a control sample of non-interacting galaxies. We conclude that the characteristics of the interactions and the ratio of luminosity galaxy pair members involved in a merger are important parameters in setting galaxy properties.

40|$|Serum {{antibody}} {{responses to}} ingested aqueous alcohol-extracted soya proteins were studied in thirty-six pre-ruminant calves. Characterization of this antibody {{showed it to}} be predominantly a complement-fixing IgG 1 preciptin. No evidence of tolerance was seen; previously sensitized calves responded to reintroduction of a soya diet with marked increases in antibody levels. The soya antigen was shown to be resistant to proteolysis and, to a lesser degree, to the microbial action of rumen fluid. Biopsy studies showed that the feeding of soya protein resulted in <b>morphological</b> <b>disturbances</b> to the villi and lamina propria of the intestine. Physiological studies by Thirty-Vella loop perfusion in the pig showed that soya protein solutions resulted in significant inhibition of flow rates. The effect was only observed after previous sensitization with the soya antigen. This study shows the necessity of applying immunological criteria to the quality control of soya bean processing {{in order to ensure}} that the sensitizing agent is eliminated and the nutritional qualities of soya protein concentrates are optimized...|$|R

40|$|<b>Morphological</b> <b>disturbances</b> and gas {{kinematics}} of the SB 0 galaxy NGC 7679 = Arp 216 are investigated {{to understand}} {{the history of this}} highly composite object, where AGN and starburst signatures dominate in the X-ray and optical/IR regime, respectively. Perturbations of the ionized gas velocity field appear quite mild within 15 '' (~ 5 kpc) of the center, so it can be straightforwardly modeled as a circularly rotating disk. Outside that radius, significant disturbances are seen. In particular, the eastern distorted arm as well as the huge neutral hydrogen bridge connecting NGC 7679 to the nearby Seyfert spiral NGC 7682 unambiguously represent the vestige of a close encounter of the two objects ~ 500 Myr ago. The relationship of such a past event with the much more recent, centrally located starburst (not older than 20 Myr) cannot be easily established. Together, the classification of NGC 7679 is less extreme than that proposed in the past, being simply a (disturbed) galaxy where starburst and AGN activity coexist with a starburst dominating the bolometric luminosity...|$|R
40|$|Major gas-rich mergers {{are thought}} to be {{responsible}} of a dramatic evolution of galaxies. Attending to the changes in the morphology, Kormendy & Sanders (1992) propose that mergers of gas rich disks (U/LIRGs) lead to the formation of elliptical galaxies. Due to the large timescales needed to complete the merger, we cannot study this process following the transformation of an individual system. Instead, we need to compare the properties of systems along the different stages of the merger sequence. However, identifying all the intermediate stages of a merger and placing them in the right evolutionary order it is not an easy task. Moreover, apart from the morphological changes, Sanders et al. (1988) propose there is also a change in the ionizing mechanism along the merger sequence, from dusty starbursts in the initial stages (U/LIRGs) to unobscured QSO activity in the final ones. While it is quite clear that mergers lead to massive starburst activity, sometimes hidden by dust, and therefore, U/LIRGs (Surace et al. 2000; Veilleux et al. 2002; Kim et al. 2013), it is not so clear if the QSOs activity is merger triggered and if so, when exactly during the merger it starts. The best approach is to find systems with intermediate properties in the proposed sequence, that is, galaxies hosting bright nuclear QSOs, showing <b>morphological</b> <b>disturbance</b> typical of a past merger and with an important post-starburst population, relics of the intense starburst activity triggered in the past. The best example of this kind of systems are post-starburst QSOs (Brotherton et al., 1999; Cales et al. 2011, 2013, 2015), which have been proposed to be the missing evolutionary link. They are, therefore, ideal laboratories to study connections between the starburst and AGN phenomenon. In this thesis we have characterized and compared the star formation histories, average stellar population properties, star formation rates (SFR), and ionized gas properties, in two small samples of galaxies in different stages across the merger sequence, three LIRGs (the two pre-mergers IC 1623 and NGC 6090 and the merger NGC 2623) and nine PSQSOs, by analysing high quality Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) data in the rest-frame optical range 3700 - 7000 Å, and high resolution HST imaging. Additionally, for NGC 2623 we have narrow band imaging in Halpha and [NII] 6583 from OSIRIS@GTC Tunable Filters, that allow us to study the outer parts of the tidal tails. The results from the LIRGs and PSQSOs have been compared with control Sbc and Sc galaxies from CALIFA survey (González Delgado et al. 2015). The methodology applied has been the same for all, a full spectral fitting analysis was performed using the Starlight code (Cid Fernandes et al. 2005) with a combination of single stellar population (SSP) models from the literature (González Delgado et al. 2005, Vazdekis et al. 2010). With our data we find a evolutionary sequence related to the merger progression that is in agreement with recent high resolution simulations (Teyssier et al. 2010). In the initial stages (pre-mergers) the induced star formation (SF) is extended, and enhanced, on average, by a factor 4 with respect to the control spirals. When we resolve it spatially we find that for IC 1623 W the enhancement is the same in the central region and in the disk (by a factor 7), while for NGC 6090 NE the enhancement is higher in the central region (by a factor 9), still significant at one half light radius (by a factor 5) and less significant in the disk (only enhanced by a factor 1. 5). Star formation is the dominating ionization mechanism in both pre-mergers. Attending to the importance of stellar populations 300 Myr, we find that the merger-induced star formation started earlier in IC 1623 W than in NGC 6090 NE. Moreover, in general, the SF is significantly enhanced in this period in the 3 LIRGs in comparison to spirals. In addition, while the specific SFR profile decline for the spirals below 1 HLR, due to the presence of the bulge that inhibites the SF, for the LIRGs the profile remain flat, indicating that their central regions are still growing. In more advanced mergers, as NGC 2623, we find that most of the young SF is concentrated in the central region, enhanced by a factor 9 with respect to control spirals. However, there exists also lower level of star formation in the outer parts, enhanced by 10 ^ 11 Msun (Kormendy et al., 2009; Toft et al., 2014, Cappellari et al. 2013). N...|$|E
40|$|Morphological lesions in hepatic stellate cells {{caused by}} the {{immunosuppressive}} doses of dexamethasone were investigated in dogs. The archival samples of liver collected during a surgical biopsy were examined. The samples were fixed in 10 % buffered formalin or Carnoy’s solution and then stained with routine histochemical methods. The lesions were also investigated under electron microscope. It was demonstrated {{that the number of}} stellate cells significantly increased (P = 0. 0277), yet the size of cytoplasmic lipid droplets significantly decreased (P = 0. 0001). Even though steroid-induced hepatopathy {{is considered to be a}} reversible pathology, and the lesions in hepatocytes under the influence of dexamethasone occur in a short period, it was found that hepatic stellate cells proliferated and underwent activation. This resulted in collagen accumulation in the hepatic sinuses. The functional and <b>morphological</b> <b>disturbances</b> in the canine liver in the course of steroid-induced hepatopathy are initially subclinical, but the changes in the structure and function of hepatic stellate cells may become a cause of lesions in the wall of hepatic sinusoidal vessels, which may induce additional functional pathologies unrelated to the damage to hepatocytes...|$|R
40|$|Ierobina® is a Brazilian {{phytopharmaceutical}} product {{employed for}} the treatment of dyspepsia (280 mg/kg/day). Despite its widespread use in the country for over 75 years, only recently its therapeutic efficacy has been attested in animals; however, no toxicological investigations have been carried out for the product to date. In this paper we evaluated the acute toxicity of Ierobina® administrated by gavage in mice (single doses of 2100 mg/kg, 6300 mg/kg and 12600 mg/kg), along with its chronic effects in rats, after product administration per os daily, at the doses of 2800 mg/kg and 5600 mg/kg, for 180 days. The product had low acute toxicity; all observed alterations were reversible and no animal died during the experiments. In chronic toxicological studies, Ierobina® administration for 180 days did not cause any changes in hematological and biochemical parameters, with the exception of decreasing the levels of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and creatinine. However, histological evaluation of kidney, liver and other selected organs showed normal architecture, suggesting no <b>morphological</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Hence, considering the obtained results and the fact that Ierobina® has been commercialized for decades in Brazil, without any notified case of toxicity, it seems that the product is safe for human use...|$|R
40|$|The {{quartet of}} galaxies NGC 7769, 7770, 7771 and 7771 A {{is a system}} of {{interacting}} galaxies. Close interaction between galaxies caused characteristic morphological features: tidal arms and bars, {{as well as an}} induced star formation. In this study, we performed the Fabry-Perot scanning interferometry of the system in Ha line and studied the velocity fields of the galaxies. We found that the rotation curve of NGC 7769 is weakly distorted. The rotation curve of NGC 7771 is strongly distorted with the tidal arms caused by direct flyby of NGC 7769 and flyby of a smaller neighbor NGC 7770. The rotation curve of NGC 7770 is significantly skewed because of the interaction with the much massive NGC 7771. The rotation curves and <b>morphological</b> <b>disturbances</b> suggest that the NGC 7769 and NGC 7771 have passed the first pericenter stage, however, probably the second encounter has not happened yet. Profiles of surface brightness of NGC 7769 have a characteristic break, and profiles of color indices have a minimum at a radius of intensive star formation induced by the interaction with NGC 7771.

40|$|Models {{of galaxy}} {{formation}} invoke the major merger of gas-rich progenitor galaxies as the trigger for significant phases of black hole {{growth and the}} associated feedback that suppresses star formation to create red spheroidal remnants. However, the observational evidence for the connection between mergers and active galactic nucleus (AGN) phases is not clear. We analyze a sample of low-mass early-type galaxies known {{to be in the}} process of migrating from the blue cloud to the red sequence via an AGN phase in the green valley. Using deeper imaging from SDSS Stripe 82, we show that the fraction of objects with major <b>morphological</b> <b>disturbances</b> is high during the early starburst phase, but declines rapidly to the background level seen in quiescent early-type galaxies by the time of substantial AGN radiation several hundred Myr after the starburst. This observation empirically links the AGN activity in low-redshift early-type galaxies to a significant merger event in the recent past. The large time delay between the merger-driven starburst and the peak of AGN activity allows for the merger features to decay to the background and hence may explain the weak link between merger features and AGN activity in the literature.

40|$|Common general anesthetics {{administered}} to young rats {{at the peak}} of brain development cause wide- spread apoptotic neurodegeneration in their immature brain. Behavioral studies have shown that this leads to learning and memory deficiencies later in life. The subic- ulum, a part of the hippocampus proper and Papez’s circuit, is involved in cognitive development and is vulnerable to anesthesia-induced developmental neurodegeneration. This degeneration is manifested by acute substantial neuroa- poptotic damage and permanent neuronal loss in later stages of synaptogenesis. Since synapse formation is a critical component of brain development, we examined the effects of highly neurotoxic anesthesia combination (iso- flurane, nitrous oxide, and midazolam) on ultrastructural development of synapses in the rat subiculum. We found that this anesthesia, when administered {{at the peak of}} synaptogenesis, causes long-lasting injury to the subicular neuropil. This is manifested as neuropil scarcity and dis- array, morphological changes indicative of mitochondria degeneration, a {{decrease in the number of}} neuronal profiles with multiple synaptic boutons and significant decreases in synapse volumetric densities. We believe that observed <b>morphological</b> <b>disturbances</b> of developing synapses may, at least in part, contribute to the learning and memory deficits that occur later in life after exposure of the immature brain to general anesthesia...|$|R
