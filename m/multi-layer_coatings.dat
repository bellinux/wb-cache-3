5000|$|Multicolor {{thermal paper}} first became {{available}} in the early 1990s {{with the introduction of}} the Fuji Thermo-Autochrome (TA) system. [...] This was followed in the early 2000s by the development of the Polaroid Zink ("zero-ink") system. [...] Both of these methods rely on <b>multi-layer</b> <b>coatings</b> with three separate colorizing layers, but different methods are used for independent activation of each layer.|$|E
50|$|Polyelectrolyte multi-layers are a {{promising}} {{area of research}} in the polymer coating industry because they can be applied in a spray-on fashion at low cost in a water-based solvent. Although the polymers are held to the surface only by electrostatic forces, the <b>multi-layer</b> <b>coatings</b> adhere aggressively under liquid shear. The disadvantage to this coating technology is that the layers have the consistency of a gel and thus are weak against abrasion.|$|E

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} of pigmented <b>multi-layer</b> protective <b>coatings</b> is {{the matter}} of the present investigation. Finely sieved Al-Mg (4. 5 wt. %) powders were used in combination with a phenyl-methyl silicone resin to form single or <b>multi-layered</b> <b>coatings</b> with good erosion-corrosion properties. The coatings were formed on low carbon steel by alternating a layer of resin deposited by dipping or spraying to a layer of dry metallic powders deposited by fluidized bed. Baking in convection oven at 250 degrees C for 45 min allowed the full consolidation of the composite coatings. The visual appearance of the coatings and the uniformity in them of the powder distribution were assessed by scanning electron microscopy. The favorable erosion-corrosion endurance of the developed coating systems were investigated by progressive load scratch tests, dry sliding linear reciprocating tribological tests and dipping in acid and salty solutions. In conclusion, the good protection grade the coatings are able to provide together with the viability of the manufacturing process ensure a high potential of the proposed technology in several industrial domains.

50|$|Flare {{occurs when}} stray light strikes the front {{element of a}} lens and then bounces around within the lens. This stray light often comes from very bright light sources, such as the Sun, bright studio lights, or a bright white background. If a light source is in the lens' angle of view, a lens hood will hardly have any effect, but the light {{does not have to}} cause lens flare. It is {{sufficient}} that stray light from a bright light source enters the lens. <b>Multi-layer</b> <b>coatings</b> in newer lenses also help to reduce lens flare.|$|E
5000|$|Plasma {{transferred}} wire arc (PTWA) {{thermal spraying}} is a thermal spraying process that deposits a coating {{on the internal}} surface of a cylindrical surface, or external surface of any geometry. It is predominantly known for its use in coating the cylinder bores of an engine, enabling the use of aluminum engine blocks {{without the need for}} heavy cast iron sleeves. A single conductive wire is used as [...] "feedstock" [...] for the system. A supersonic plasma jet melts the wire, atomizes it and propels it onto the substrate. The plasma jet is formed by a transferred arc between a non-consumable cathode and the wire. After atomization, forced gas transports the stream of molten droplets onto the bore wall. The particles flatten when they impinge {{on the surface of the}} substrate, due to their high kinetic energy. The particles rapidly solidify upon contact and can form both crystalline and amorphus phases. There is also the possibility to produce <b>multi-layer</b> <b>coatings.</b> The stacked particles make up a highly wear-resistant coating. All conductive wires up to and including 0.0625" [...] (1.6mm) can be used as feedstock material, including [...] "cored" [...] wires. PTWA can be used to apply a coating to the wear surface of engine or transmission components to replace a bushing or bearing. For example, using PTWA to coat the bearing surface of a connecting rod offers a number of benefits including reductions in weight, cost, friction potential, and stress in the connecting rod.|$|E

The same protocol used on the QCM experiments was followed, dipping glass slides in similar solutions, in order to obtain the <b>multi-layer</b> <b>coatings.</b> Samples were prepared in order to obtain 5 pairs of bilayers, being the last composed of HAP, designated (Cht-HAP) 5, and samples terminated by chitosan designated (Cht-HAP) 4 Cht.|$|E

In ellipsometry, which is a branch of optical polarimetry, fast measurement (at the sub-millisecond time scale) of the state of polarization of reflected light is making possible continuous, in-situ, and non-destructive monitoring and control of industrial processes that involve the formation of thin films and <b>multi-layer</b> <b>coatings</b> at surfaces and interfaces.

Here a three-layered architecture of nano-structured <b>multi-layered</b> composite <b>coatings</b> is used, and the wear mechanism of the ceramic tool is examined. This approach allows implementing a direct control over the contact characteristics of the cutting process {{in order to reduce}} the normal and shear stresses that increase the probability of tool failure as a result of brittle fracture.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the first results on forming of <b>multi-layered</b> superhard <b>coatings</b> Ti-Hf-Si-N/NbN/Al 2 O 3 and their properties {{as well as}} structure. Microstructure, elemental and phase compositions of <b>multi-layered</b> <b>coatings</b> obtained by different methods were investigated. There were used such methods as: scanning electron microscopy EDS JEM- 7000 F microscope (with microanalysis) for research of cross-section of coatings, with subsequent Auger-electron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, optical inverted microscope Olympus GX 51, electron-ion microscopes Quanta 200 3 D and Quanta 600 (scanning electron microscopy), equipped by the detector of X-ray radiation of the system PEGASUS 2000. It was stated that hardness of coatings has reached 56 GPa, {{and at the same}} time the factor of wearing during friction was the smallest 2. 571 x 10 (- 5). It was also noted that nitrogen pressure in the chamber at the deposition of the top layer significantly influences on the properties of samples. For example, the coe cient of friction at P = 0 : 3 Pa from 0. 2 at the beginning of track to 0. 001 (during the tests), and at the pressure of nitrogen P = 0 : 8 Pa, the coefficient of friction was equal to 0. 314 at the beginning of track and 0. 384 at the end (during the tests).

40|$|During {{the last}} several years, {{microporous}} nickel-chromium coatings have been critically scrutinized by the automotive industry. Today these coatings must be free of all surface defects, even after long-term exposure to accelerated tests and in real-life service. While proper control of all the multi-layer nickel deposits is important, blemish-free surfaces can only be obtained when the microdiscontinuity and {{the activity of the}} post-nickel strike are properly achieved and maintained. This edited version of a paper presented at SUR/FIN @ ' 96 -Cleveland shows that research indicates that the most important factor is the electrochemical potential of the microporous nickel strike deposit. D ecorative nickel-chromium {{has been used as a}} protective coating on a variety of substrates for more than 70 years. During this time, significant improvements have been in the corrosion resistance of these platings. This is especially true for <b>multi-layer</b> <b>coatings</b> developed for highly corrosive environments. The corrosion mechanisms of <b>multi-layer</b> <b>coatings</b> are very well understood. The literature, however, has often been inconsistent with respect to the recdmmendation of specific operating parameters and the use of additives to obtain the desired conditions required for maximum corrosion performance. In the past, the main requirement of nickel-chromium coatings was the prevention of base metal corrosion. Surface blemishes and a certain amount of surface dulling was allowed. These surface defects usually occurred because of the deterioration of the microdiscontinuous deposit(s). Today, multi-layer nickel-chromium coatings must provide very long-term base metal corrosion resistance an...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} protect carbon/carbon (C/C) {{composites}} from oxidation at high temperature, a nano SiC n -MoSi 2   coating was prepared on SiC pre-coated C/C composites by novel hydrothermal electrophoretic deposition. The phase compositions of the as-prepared coatings were analyzed by XRD, the morphologies of the <b>multi-layer</b> <b>coatings</b> were observed by SEM and the high temperature anti-oxidation properties of the multi-coatings were investigated by isothermal oxidation test. The influence of hydrothermal electrophoretic deposition voltage on the phase composition, microstructure and high temperature oxidation resistance of the multilayer coating were particularly investigated. The invalidation behavior of the coated sample during the thermal cycle process was analyzed. Results show that the outer layer coatings {{are mainly composed of}} β-SiC and MoSi 2 phases. The thickness, density and anti-oxidation properties of the SiC n -MoSi 2 coating are improved with the increase of deposition voltage from 100 V to 180 V. However, cracks are observed at a high deposition voltage (220 V) and the decrease in oxidation resistance is detected. The <b>multi-layer</b> <b>coatings</b> deposited at 180 V exhibit excellent oxidation resistance ability, which can effectively protect C/C composites from oxidation in air at 1500 ¡æ for 346 h with a weight loss of 1. 41 %.

40|$|Abstract. Thin (SiC/Ti 3 SiC 2) n <b>multi-layered</b> <b>coatings</b> were {{deposited}} at 1100 °C on ceramic substrates by chemical {{vapour deposition}} (CVD) methods. Each SiC sub-layer was classically processed from H 2 /CH 3 SiCl 3. Each Ti 3 SiC 2 sub-layer was obtained by reactive CVD (RCVD) from a H 2 /TiCl 4 gaseous mixture reacting on each SiC solid sub-layer that was previously deposited. The growth of Ti 3 SiC 2 by RCVD involves partial or total SiC consumption. The H 2 /TiCl 4 ratio was chosen {{on the basis of}} a thermodynamic study. Using a sufficiently high H 2 /TiCl 4 ratio and limiting the sub-layer thickness allowed the formation of TiC or binary titanium silicides to be avoided. By using a constant low gas pressure in the CVD reactor, it was possible to obtain nearly pure Ti 3 SiC 2 sub-layers as thin as 0. 8 µm. In that case, the ternary compound exhibits basal planes oriented perpendicular to the substrate surface. A way to obtain thinner sub-layers was the use of a pressure-pulsed CVD method. In addition, the pressure-pulsed method allowed the preferential orientation to be prevented in the Ti 3 SiC 2 coating...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of studying the structural parameters and mechanical properties of multi-element coatings based on-TiZrN, TiZrAlN, TiZrCrN, and TiNbAlN. The phase composition, the structural parameters, and the mechanical properties of such coatings are shown to depend on the design of cathode evaporators and the machine layout at the moment of application. Compared to TiN coating, multi-element coatings have higher residual compressive stress, smaller CSR, higher microdeformations of the crystal lattice, better mechanical properties, yet weaker adhesion to the tool base. Based on studying their structural parameters and mechanical properties, we have designed double-layer coatings.

40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we present}} a comparison between laser clad experiments and model predictions of the entire geometry of laser deposited <b>multi-layered</b> <b>coatings.</b> Recently we {{have shown that the}} recursive model describing the geometry of laser clad coatings combined with experimental track characteristics leads to specific functions describing the geometry of coatings formed by overlap of individual tracks depending on the processing parameters. The recursive model provides an adequate description of the whole geometry of the coating from the Height H and width w of a single laser track for any overlap ratio OR. We have shown that the height and width of a single track are well correlated with the main laser cladding processing parameters for both coaxial and side cladding set-ups. Combining these two approaches leads to a prediction of the complete geometry of laser clad coatings from a number of basic processing parameters. These parameters are: Feeding rate F, Laser beam scanning speed S and overlap ratio OR. The functions that describe the height and waviness of the final coating are the same for both coaxial and side cladding set-ups. These model predictions lead to very simple, yet very accurate predictions of the entire geometry of the laser deposited layers...|$|R
