40|$|International audienceIn this work, a nonlocal quasi- 3 D {{trigonometric}} plate {{theory for}} micro/nanoscale plates is proposed. In order {{to introduce the}} size influences, the Eringen's nonlocal elasticity theory is utilized. In addition, the theory considers both shear deformation and thickness stretching effects by a <b>trigonometric</b> <b>variation</b> of all displacements within the thickness, and respects the stress-free boundary conditions {{on the top and}} bottom surfaces of the plate without considering the shear correction factor. The advantage of this theory is that, in addition to considering the small scale and thickness stretching effects (epsilon(z) not equal 0), the displacement field is modelled with only 5 unknowns as the first order shear deformation theory (FSDT). Analytical solutions for vibration of simply supported micro/nanoscale plates are illustrated, and the computed results are compared with the available solutions in the literature and finite element model using ABAQUS software package. The influences of the nonlocal parameter, shear deformation and thickness stretching on the vibration behaviors of the micro/ nanoscale plates are examine...|$|R

40|$|A {{study is}} made {{of the effects of}} {{variation}} in the lamination and geometric parameters, and boundary conditions of multi-layered composite panels on the accuracy of the detailed response characteristics obtained by five different modeling approaches. The modeling approaches considered include four two-dimensional models, each with five parameters to characterize the deformation in the thickness direction, and a predictor-corrector approach with twelve displacement parameters. The two-dimensional models are first-order shear deformation theory, third-order theory; a theory based on <b>trigonometric</b> <b>variation</b> of the transverse shear stresses through the thickness, and a discrete layer theory. The combination of the following four key elements distinguishes the present study from previous studies reported in the literature: (1) the standard of comparison is taken to be the solutions obtained by using three-dimensional continuum models for each of the individual layers; (2) both mechanical and thermal loadings are considered; (3) boundary conditions other than simply supported edges are considered; and (4) quantities compared include detailed through-the-thickness distributions of transverse shear and transverse normal stresses. Based on the numerical studies conducted, the predictor-corrector approach appears to be the most effective technique for obtaining accurate transverse stresses, and for thermal loading, none of the two-dimensional models is adequate for calculating transverse normal stresses, even when used in conjunction with three-dimensional equilibrium equations...|$|R

30|$|In this article, we have {{introduced}} a new transmuted wrapped distribution named TWE distribution, for modeling the circular data. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, the transmutation of a circular distribution is a new attempt to obtain more flexible circular distribution. In the paper, the pdf and the cdf of the introduced distribution are derived and their behaviors are illustrated. Rényi and Shannon entropies of the distribution are obtained in an open form. Furthermore, explicit forms of the basic characteristics of the introduced distribution such as <b>mean,</b> <b>trigonometric</b> moments, characteristic function, quantile function and others are obtained. To estimate the unknown parameters of the introduced distribution, the maximum likelihood, the least squares and the weighted least squares estimators are obtained. By a conducted Monte Carlo simulation study, the efficiencies of these estimators are comparatively illustrated. The results of the Monte Carlo simulation show that when the sample size increases, both Bias and MSE values decrease for all estimation methods. Finally, we apply the introduced distribution to a real-life dataset named turtles dataset. Using the log-likelihood, AIC and Watson’s statistic criteria, the modeling performance of the introduced distribution is compared with wrapped exponential distribution and wrapped Lindley distribution. According to the obtained results, we can say that the TWE distribution is a better model to the turtle data than WE and WL distributions.|$|R
40|$|Trigonometric parallaxes for {{stars in}} the regions of the {{variable}} stars delta Cephei and EV Lacertae are derived from data collected with the Multichannel Astrometric Photometer (MAP) and the Thaw Refractor of the University of Pittsburgh's Allegheny Observatory.

These datasets constitute the major narrow-field astrometric collections of this star. The newly derived weighted <b>mean</b> <b>trigonometric</b> parallax of Algol is now + 0. 0343 +/- 0. 00085 corresponding to a distance modulus of 2. 32 +/- 0. 054 mag. The total mass of the Algol system is estimated at 6. 05 +/- 0. 45 solar mass. The photocentric semimajor axis of the AB/C orbit is determined in the blue, yellow, and red bandpasses of the three independent astrometric systems. The total mass for the A and B component stars is found to be 4. 63 +/- 0. 35 solar mass and the mass of the C component is determined to be 1. 42 +/- 0. 13 solar mass. Residuals to this solution showed no meaningful correlation to the orbital motion of A/B. Thus it is probable that the photocenter is located near the center of mass of the A/B subsystem. There is no evidence of a previously suggested 32 yr orbital motion and no significant acceleration is evident in the 60 yr photographic series. It is therefore unlikely that the system has a fourth stellar mass component. It is noted that the visual band interferometric studies of the Algol system have the AB and C components interchanged...|$|R
