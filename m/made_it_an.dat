5|$|The 1986 crime drama film Mona Lisa is set around King's Cross. At the time, the downmarket and seedy area {{surrounding}} the station, coupled with urban decay, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> ideal location. Subsequent early 1990s tabloid coverage {{of crime and}} prostitution around King's Cross referred back to the film.|$|E
5|$|Cutthroat {{competition}} {{was nothing to}} what was to follow. The 1890s were a tough time for the Romanian economy, and {{a rising tide of}} anti-Semitism <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> even tougher time for the Jews. One quarter of the Jewish population emigrated, with intellectuals particularly likely to leave, and those intellectuals who remained were more interested in politics than in theater: this was a period of social ferment, with Jewish socialists in Iaşi starting Der Veker (The Awakener).|$|E

5|$|DNA {{was first}} {{isolated}} by Friedrich Miescher in 1869. Its molecular structure was first identified by James Watson and Francis Crick at the Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge in 1953, whose model-building efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by Raymond Gosling, {{who was a}} post-graduate student of Rosalind Franklin. DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the ergodic theorem and the theory of elasticity. The unique material properties of DNA have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro- and nano-fabrication. Among notable advances in this field are DNA origami and DNA-based hybrid materials.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, the island's {{location}} <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> ideal {{base for}} smuggling. It has been alleged that an old mine shaft {{on the north}} side of the island connects with a series of natural tunnels, and a concealed exit to the sea. Although Flat Holm was in full view of both the Welsh and English coasts, customs authorities were powerless to act as they had no boat to take them to the island. According to tradition, a small cave in the east cliff at Flat Holm was used for the storage of contraband, mainly tea and brandy.|$|E
5|$|Gedi's {{location}} {{along the}} coast and association with similar sites along the Swahili Coast <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> important trade center. Although there are few historical documents specifically associating Gedi with Indian Ocean trade, the site {{is thought to have}} been one of the most important sites {{along the coast}}. Gedi's architecture and an abundance of imported material culture including pottery, beads, and coins provide evidence of the city's rising prosperity over the course of its occupation from as early as the eleventh century to its abandonment in the early seventeenth century.|$|E

5|$|In late October, the ITCZ {{developed}} a persistent area of convection {{west of the}} Indonesian island of Sumatra. A tropical low formed on October28 within the Australian region, which initially failed to develop much due to persistent wind shear. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) named the system Melanie on October31 {{to the north of}} the Cocos Islands. The newly upgraded storm tracked generally westward due to a ridge to the south, and entered the south-west Indian Ocean on November1 as a strong tropical storm. At that time, Melanie was renamed Bellamine. After the ridged moved farther away, the storm turned more to the southwest and began quickly intensifying. Early on November3, Bellamine attained tropical cyclone status, and the next day reached peak 10minute winds of 175km/h (110mph); this <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> intense tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Lipsett {{decided to}} tow New Mexico for {{scrapping}} at Newark, New Jersey. The proximity of Newark to rail lines <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> ideal location for dismantling {{the ship and}} hauling away the steel. In early November 1947 New Mexico departed Boston, towed by two tugs. On 12 November, while {{off the coast of}} New York, the tugs pulling the battleship encountered heavy weather and were forced to cut the tow lines. Running lights were kept on aboard New Mexico along with three crewmembers, but the tugs eventually lost sight of the battleship. New Mexico then drifted as a derelict until spotted by a Coast Guard plane the next day, 35 miles off the coast. The two tugs then secured tow lines and continued the journey to the scrapyard.|$|E

I think those ideals might well be stated as being to secure our national safety, and to ensure the maintenance of our White Australia Policy to continue as an integral portion of the British Empire. We intend to keep this country white and not allow its people to be faced with the problems that at present are practically insoluble {{in many parts of the}} world.|$|E

5|$|Sharks {{generally}} are opportunistic feeders, but scientists propose that megalodon was largely predatory. Its great size, high-speed swimming capability, and powerful jaws, {{coupled with a}} formidable feeding apparatus, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> apex predator capable of consuming {{a broad spectrum of}} animals. A study focusing on calcium isotopes of extinct and extant elasmobranch sharks and rays revealed that megalodon fed at a higher trophic level than the contemporaneous great white shark, that is to say it was higher up in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} settlements date {{to around}} AD700. Aalborg's {{position at the}} narrowest point on the Limfjord <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> important harbour during the Middle Ages, and later a large industrial centre. Architecturally, the city {{is known for its}} half-timbered mansions built by its prosperous merchants. Budolfi Church, now a cathedral, dates {{from the end of the}} 14th century and Aalborghus Castle, a royal residence, was built in 1550. Today, Aalborg is a city in transition from a working-class industrial area to a knowledge-based community. A major exporter of grain, cement, and spirits, its thriving business interests include Siemens Wind Power, Aalborg Industries, and Aalborg Portland. These companies have become global producers of wind turbine rotors, marine boilers and cement.|$|E
5|$|The second kingdom's {{economy was}} based on both {{agriculture}} and trade. The economy was centralized and directed through a communal organization, where grains were stored in communal granaries, and distributed amongst the population according to social statues. The organization also controlled the animal herds in the kingdom. Some people were directly connected to the palace instead of the communal organization, those included the metal and textile producers and the military officials. Ebla was an important trading partner and rival, Mari's position <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> important trading center as it controlled the road linking between the Levant and Mesopotamia.|$|E

5|$|The {{source of}} the river is in the Mourne Mountains {{on the slopes of}} Ott Mountain. The river then flows in a northerly {{direction}} into Fofanny Dam. It continues its flow in a north-easterly direction into Tollymore Forest Park where the tributaries Spinkwee and Trassey rivers join it. The Shimna finally flows to the east, then takes a south easterly direction toward Newcastle where at one point it flows through Tipperary Wood. The final tributaries to join the river prior to it reaching the sea are the Burren River and the Tullybrannigan River, at Islands Park. Near the mouth, as it flows through Castle Park, it widens quite considerably to create a shallow boating pond. The river's geology, flora and fauna have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> Area of Special Scientific Interest (ASSI).|$|E
5|$|The {{volatility}} of the Maltese tourism {{market in the}} past has been largely due to trends in the preferences of tourists from the United Kingdom, who comprise Malta's largest tourism market. Although Malta's uniform use of English, its traditional ties to the United Kingdom and low-cost travel options have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> attractive option to British tourists, changing preferences of these tourists can impact Malta's tourism income quite significantly. For example, the increasing preference of British tourists for Spanish destinations during the 1980s was reflected in a drop in Malta's tourism numbers during that period.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Chadwick {{followed}} Rutherford to the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where Chadwick {{earned his}} Doctor of Philosophy degree under Rutherford's supervision from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in June 1921. He was Rutherford's {{assistant director of}} research at the Cavendish Laboratory for over a decade at a time when it was one of the world's foremost centres for the study of physics, attracting students like John Cockcroft, Norman Feather, and Mark Oliphant. Chadwick followed his discovery of the neutron by measuring its mass. He anticipated that neutrons would become a major weapon in the fight against cancer. Chadwick left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1935 to become a professor of physics at the University of Liverpool, where he overhauled an antiquated laboratory and, by installing a cyclotron, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> important centre for the study of nuclear physics.|$|E

5|$|By 1909, it {{had spread}} to the Orange River Colony. In South Africa, as at Azusa Street, the {{movement}} was initially multi-racial, appealing to both Boers and blacks. It expanded rapidly among African farm workers in the Orange River Colony and Wakkerstroom, where Pentecostal beliefs in divine healing through prayer would have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> attractive alternative to traditional or medical treatment. Lake made contact with the Wakkerstroom Zionists led by Pieter Louis Le Roux, and many Zionists joined the Apostolic Faith Mission. Their influence {{can be seen in}} the AFM's practice of baptism by triple immersion, once each in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. There was also interaction with other churches, such as the Plymouth Brethren and International Holiness movement, which often resulted in individuals or whole congregations joining the AFM. Most AFM converts, however, came from the Dutch Reformed churches.|$|E
5|$|From the 16th century, the landowners {{were the}} Carre family, who {{operated}} tight {{control over the}} town, and it grew little in the early modern period. The manor passed from the Carre family to the Hervey family by the marriage of Isabella Carre to John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol, in 1688. The town's common land and fields were legally enclosed by 1794, giving ownership mostly to the Hervey family; this coincided with making the Slea into a canal, and heralded the first steps towards modern industry. The Sleaford Navigation brought economic growth until it was superseded by the railways in the mid-1850s. In the 20th century, the sale of farmland around Sleaford by Bristol Estates {{led to the development}} of large housing estates. The subsequent availability of affordable housing combined with the town's educational facilities and low crime rates <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> attractive destination for home-buyers. As a result, the town's population underwent the fastest growth of any town in the county in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Route S3 {{was defined}} in 1929 {{to run from}} Route 3 in East Rutherford west to Route 6 (US46) in Clifton, (this {{is now part of}} Route 3).

World War II delayed completion of Route S3 long enough for an alternate freeway route to be selected, and the part of Allwood Road that was taken over is no longer a state highway. In 1948, the route was assigned the number Route S3 Spur. The number was changed to Route 161 in the 1953 state highway renumbering, and ever since then it has remained an isolated state highway.|$|E
