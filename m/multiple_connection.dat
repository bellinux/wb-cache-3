40|$|A lot of {{work has}} been done on routing {{protocols}} for mobile ad hoc networks, but still standardization of them requires some more issues less addressed by the existing routing protocols. In this paper a new paradigm of maintaining <b>multiple</b> <b>connections</b> in adhoc routing protocols has been highlighted which may be crucial for efficient routing in mobile ad hoc networks. The problem of <b>multiple</b> <b>connections</b> has been hardly worked on in adhoc networks. In this paper the solution of route maintenance if nodes are maintaining <b>multiple</b> <b>connections</b> has been proposed. This idea not only helps to solve the <b>multiple</b> <b>connections</b> problem, but also take care of proper bandwidth distribution to different connections as per different traffic types. Study has been incorporated on existing AODV with changes. Simulation studies have been performed over packet delivery ratio, throughput and message overheads.

40|$|Abstract â€” In this paper, {{we propose}} an iSCSI-APT (iSCSI with Automatic Parallelism Tuning) that maximizes iSCSI {{throughput}} in long-fat networks. In recent years, as a protocol for building SANs (Storage Area Networks), iSCSI has been attracting attention for its low cost and high compatibility with existing networking infrastructure. However, {{it has been}} known that iSCSI throughput degrades in a long-fat network. iSCSI supports a feature called <b>multiple</b> <b>connections,</b> which allows data delivery over <b>multiple</b> TCP <b>connections</b> in a single session. However, for effective utilization of the <b>multiple</b> <b>connections</b> feature, the number of <b>multiple</b> <b>connections</b> must be appropriately configured according to the network status. In this paper, we propose the iSCSI-APT that automatically adjusts the number of <b>multiple</b> <b>connections</b> according to the network status. Through experiments using our iSCSI-APT implementation, we demonstrate that iSCSI-APT operates quite effectively regardless of the network delay. I...|$|R

40|$|Coronal {{magnetic}} field governs {{most of the}} coronal activities. Despite of its importance in solar atmosphere, there is no accurate method of measuring the coronal {{magnetic field}}. The current measurement methods of coronal magnetic fields depend on extrapolation of photospheric magnetic fields. There are different models to study the global structure of coronal magnetic field. The most commonly used models are PFSS model and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. In this thesis, we study the coronal magnetic field condition during major solar energetic particle (SEP) event of 23 rd solar cycle by using the PFSS model. We use 114 SEP events observed by the SOHO/ERNE experiment in 1996 - 2010. In the beginning we identified 43 events that are relatively free from the disturbance caused by interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). We examined these SEP events using IDL software developed by Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Lab (LMSAL). We produced plots of open coronal magnetic field of each events using SolarSoft. We also classified SEP events according to their number of connection points as events with; single connection point, double connection points and <b>multiple</b> <b>connection</b> points. Events with <b>multiple</b> <b>connection</b> points make up almost {{one third of the}} total events. These events show that the coronal magnetic connection are typically complicated and neighboring magnetic field lines in the solar wind can be magnetically connected to regions that are well separated in the low corona. We also found that the actual connection longitude (a longitude that takes in to account the coronal magnetic field) is most of the time is closer to the flare site associated with the event than the Parker spiral connection longitude. The Parker spiral longitudes, connection longitudes and flare longitudes are analyzed in detail by histograms. Finally, we chose two example events and analyzed them by using intensity-time profile of particles, plots of from LASCO CME catalog and plots produce by the SolarSoft. Based on our analysis we classified the example events into gradual and hybrid SEP events...|$|E
