40|$|The BREF {{entitled}} ‘Iron and Steel Production’ forms part of {{a series}} presenting the results of an exchange of information between EU Member States, the industries concerned, non-governmental organisations promoting environmental protection and the Commission, to draw up, review, and where necessary, update BAT reference documents as required by Article 13 (1) of the Directive. This document is published by the European Commission pursuant to Article 13 (6) of the Directive. This BREF for the iron and steel production industry covers the following specified in Annex I to Directive 2010 / 75 /EU, namely: •	activity 1. 3 : coke production •	activity 2. 1 : <b>metal</b> <b>ore</b> (including sulphide <b>ore)</b> <b>roasting</b> and <b>sintering</b> •	activity 2. 2 : production of pig iron or steel (primary or secondary fusion) including continuous casting, with a capacity exceeding 2. 5 tonnes per hour. The document also covers some activities that may be directly associated to these activities on the same site. Important issues for the implementation of Directive 2010 / 75 /EU in the production of iron and steel are the reduction of emissions to air; efficient energy and raw material usage; minimisation, recovery and the recycling of process residues; as well as effective environmental and energy management systems. The BREF document contains 13 chapters. Chapter 1 provides general information on the iron and steel sector. Chapter 2 provides information and data on general industrial processes used within this sector. Chapters 3 to 8 provide information on particular iron and steel processes (sinter plants, pelletisation, coke ovens, blast furnaces, basic oxygen steelmaking and casting, electric arc steelmaking and casting). In Chapter 9 the BAT conclusions, as defined in Article 3 (12) of the Directive, are presented for the sectors described in Chapters 2 to 8. JRC. J. 5 -Sustainable Production and Consumptio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Rapid {{reduction}} roasting of {{low grade}} manganese carbonate ore by coal and biomass fuels from Hunan, China was investigated. Magnetic separation behaviors and magnetic properties of raw manganese <b>ore</b> and <b>roasted</b> manganese <b>ores</b> were analyzed. After reduction by coal and biomass fuels, the manganese ores demonstrate a new Mn-Fe oxide phase, showing obvious mixed magnetic behaviors of ferromagnet and paramagnet, and the magnetic susceptibilities of <b>roasting</b> <b>ores</b> rapidly increase to almost two {{orders of magnitude}} in comparison of the raw ores. The results show that magnetizing roasting technology could enhanced the magnetic properties of the manganese ores about two orders of magnitude higher than raw manganese <b>ore</b> at low <b>roasting</b> temperature. Thereby, we deduce that the weak magnetic separation combined with high magnetic separation could be adequate for <b>roasted</b> manganese <b>ore</b> to satisfy the requirement of electrolytic manganese industry. Application of biomass in manganese <b>ore</b> <b>roasting</b> process is promising to the effective use of biomass and for decreasing the consumption of fossil fuels in the manganese industry...|$|R
