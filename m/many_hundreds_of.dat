5|$|In the Middle Ages the town, {{which was}} now known as Manceastre (later to become Manchester), grew and prospered, and trading vessels plied along the river. The hamlet of Kersal, which now forms part of the City of Salford, was gifted to the Cluniac Priory of Lenton, near Nottingham, in 1142.

5|$|Eventually, {{two large}} Native American groups {{controlled}} {{most of the}} Snake River: the Nez Perce, whose territory stretched from the southeastern Columbia Plateau into northern Oregon and western Idaho, and the Shoshone, who occupied the Snake River Plain both above and below Shoshone Falls. Lifestyles along the Snake River varied widely. Below Shoshone Falls, the economy centered on salmon, who often came up the river in enormous numbers. Salmon were the mainstay of the Nez Perce {{and most of the}} other tribes below Shoshone Falls. Above the falls, life was significantly different. The Snake River Plain forms one of the only relatively easy paths across the main Rocky Mountains for <b>many</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> miles, allowing Native Americans both east and west of the mountains to interact. As a result, the Shoshone centered on a trading economy.|$|E

5|$|Fisheries {{also have}} {{negative}} effects on seabirds, and these effects, particularly on the long-lived and slow-breeding albatrosses, {{are a source of}} increasing concern to conservationists. The bycatch of seabirds entangled in nets or hooked on fishing lines has had a big impact on seabird numbers; for example, an estimated 100,000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long-line fisheries. Overall, <b>many</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> thousands of birds are trapped and killed each year, a source of concern for some of the rarest species (for example, only about 2,000 short-tailed albatrosses are known to still exist). Seabirds are also thought to suffer when overfishing occurs.|$|E
5|$|Hale {{had spent}} <b>many</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> hours searching for comets without success, and was {{tracking}} known comets from his driveway in New Mexico when he chanced upon Hale–Bopp just after midnight. The comet had an apparent magnitude of 10.5 and lay near the globular cluster M70 {{in the constellation}} of Sagittarius. Hale first established {{that there was no}} other deep-sky object near M70, and then consulted a directory of known comets, finding that none were known to be in this area of the sky. Once he had established that the object was moving relative to the background stars, he emailed the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, the clearing house for astronomical discoveries.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> {{medicines}} {{are derived}} from plants, both traditional medicines used in herbalism and chemical substances purified from plants or first identified in them, sometimes by ethnobotanical search, and then synthesised for use in modern medicine. Modern medicines derived from plants include aspirin, taxol, morphine, quinine, reserpine, colchicine, digitalis and vincristine. Plants used in herbalism include ginkgo, echinacea, feverfew, and Saint John's wort. The pharmacopoeia of Dioscorides, De Materia Medica, describing some 600 medicinal plants, was written between 50 and 70 AD and remained in use in Europe and the Middle East until around 1600 AD; it was the precursor of all modern pharmacopoeias.|$|E

The earliest known occurrence of the spells included in the Book of the Dead is from the coffin of Queen Mentuhotep, of the 13th dynasty, where the new spells were included amongst older texts known from the Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts. Some of the spells introduced at this time claim an older provenance; for instance the rubric to spell 30B states that it was discovered by the Prince Hordjedef in the reign of King Menkaure, <b>many</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> years before it is attested in the archaeological record.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic {{ash fall}} is physically, socially, and {{economically}} disruptive. Volcanic ash can affect both proximal areas and areas <b>many</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> kilometres from the source, and causes disruptions and losses {{in a wide}} variety of different infrastructure sectors. Impacts are dependent on: ash fall thickness; the duration of the ash fall; the grain size and chemistry of the ash; whether the ash is wet or dry; and any preparedness, management and prevention (mitigation) measures employed to reduce effects from the ash fall. Different sectors of infrastructure and society are affected in different ways and are vulnerable to a range of impacts or consequences. These are discussed in the following sections.|$|E

5|$|Although the Norman {{invasion}} {{caused some}} damage as soldiers looted {{the countryside and}} land was confiscated for castle building, the English economy was not greatly affected.
