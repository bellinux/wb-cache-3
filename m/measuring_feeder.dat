40|$|Regression {{analysis}} was used to determine the ability of a number of biological parameters to predict economic efficiency. Detailed feed, financial, and production records were maintained by a random sample of eighteen Prince Edward Island (PEI) swine producers (each producing over 1000 market hogs per year). Relative economic efficiency of the operations was measured using return to management and labor (RML). Of the routinely monitored biological parameters, RML on PEI farrow-finish operations was best predicted (R 2 = 64. 8 %) by: marketed per square meter per year (p = 0. 008) and marketed per sow per year (p = 0. 096). Regression of fixed costs revealed that biological parameters had limited ability to predict fixed costs per hog on farrow-finish operations (R 2 = 30. 7 %). The only parameter contributing to the prediction of the fixed cost component of RML was feeder hog density (p = 0. 077). The variable cost component of RML on farrow-finish operations was predicted (R 2 = 94. 3 %) by feed cost per kg gain (p = 0. 000), and marketed per sow per year (p = 0. 044). The routinely recorded biological parameters on feeder farms had only limited ability to predict RML in this study (R 2 = 43. 7 %). The only parameter of any importance was marketed per square meter per year (p = 0. 106). Prediction of the fixed cost component of RML on feeder farms (R 2 = 67. 4 %) was best realized by <b>measuring</b> <b>feeder</b> hog density (p = 0. 045). The variable cost component of RML on feeder farms was reasonably well predicted (R 2 = 74. 7 %) by feed cost per kg gain (p = 0. 012). Although this parameter is difficult to monitor from records currently maintained on most farms, it points out the need to monitor feed consumption on swine farms.

40|$|The stress at {{the inlet}} nip region of a roll {{compactor}} (i. e., feeder outlet stress) {{is a necessary}} input parameter for existing powder roll compaction models; however the nip region inlet stress is poorly understood and difficult to directly measure. The inability to specify the nip region inlet stress on a roll compactor limits comparisons between powder roll compaction models and experimental results. Therefore, this thesis investigates {{the application of a}} solid plug model to a powder feed screw of a roll compactor in order to predict the stress at the inlet nip region. ^ The feeder outlet stress predictions of the Solid Plug models developed by Tadmor et al. (1972), Campbell et al. (1995), and Hyun et al. (1997 a) were compared to experimental results. Each of the Solid Plug models under-predicted the experimentally <b>measured</b> <b>feeder</b> outlet stress by orders of magnitude. Potential reasons why the Solid Plug models poorly predicted the experimental results are the accuracy of the friction coefficient measurements and the assumed values for the stress ratios. The friction coefficients could not be completely defined because the surface finish of the feed screw and barrel were unknown, and the stress ratios were assumed to equal one based on the kinetic theory of granular material (Lun, 1991). ^ The sensitivity of the Solid Plug models to the following input parameters: friction coefficients, stress ratio, and stress-density relationship are investigated. Adjusting the friction coefficients or stress ratios, such that the stress-density relationship predicts a density greater than the lower density limit, is shown to cause the Solid Plug models 2 ̆ 7 feeder outlet stress predictions to rapidly increase and become more sensitive to the mass flow rate.

The questionnaire was composed of nine self-image measures that had been utilized with early adolescents in either self-image research or investigations focusing upon school transition. Transition effects (as evidenced by time 1 and time 2 comparisons) were observed on the measures of self-consciousness, victimization, and anonymity only. Perceptions of anonymity and victimization were significantly greater at the start of a new school year (time 2) than they had been prior to transition (time 1). Self-consciousness scores showed a significant decrease from pre- to post-transition. Timing of transition comparisons revealed significant effects for the self-consciousness, victimization, and anonymity <b>measures.</b> Both <b>feeder</b> school conditions expressed significantly greater perceptions of self-consciousness and victimization than students making the transition within the same school.

Field data collected over 32 complete tidal cycles, spanning a range of wave and tide conditions, demonstrate that rip current strength and behaviour is modulated at the semi-diurnal frequency by tide-induced changes in the water-level over bar/rip morphology. Peak flow speeds in the rip neck 〈uv〉 correspond to the time of maximum wave breaking 1. 5 h before and after low water.

Around low water, the forcing of the rip current by the alongshore pressure-driven feeder current was reduced by the decrease in Qb over the bar and feeder regions, but an offshore flow through the rip channel was maintained by a localised intensification of ∂η/∂y around the ends of the inter-tidal bar...|$|R
40|$|Electronic swine feeders {{are used}} to {{automatically}} measure individual feed intake on group-housed pigs and are often used in breeding herds. Data from these feeders contain errors. In addition, electronic feeders could affect performance of growing pigs and are expensive. To address these concerns, the objectives of this research were to develop and evaluate editing methods, to measure the effect of electronic feeders on performance, and to develop and evaluate strategies that maximize the number of pigs <b>measured</b> per <b>feeder.</b> The percentage of visits that contained errors, based on 16 criteria, ranged from 4. 3 to 18. 7 % in three data sets {{and seemed to be}} largely affected by management of the feeder. A model was developed to adjust daily feed intake from error-free visits for the combined effect of errors. This and five other editing methods were then used to edit data from 124 pigs with simulated errors. The correlation of edited with true observations ranged from 0. 82 to 0. 96 for feed intake on a given day and from 0. 93 to 0. 99 for average daily feed intake. To evaluate the effect of electronic feeders on performance, 475 boars and gilts were fed using an electronic feeder or a conventional feeder. Body weight, backfat thickness, loin muscle area, and pen daily feed intake per pig were measured serially. Gilts on electronic feeders ate less, grew slower, and deposited less backfat and loin muscle area throughout the test period. There were no differences for boars. To maximize the number of pigs that are tested per electronic feeder, strategies of alternating the use of a feeder between pens of pigs were simulated in a complete data set that contained 12 weeks of feed intake data. When two pens were tested per feeder, the correlation between estimated and true average daily feed intake was 0. 98 and 0. 94 in ideal and poor data conditions, respectively. These results indicate that testing twice as many boars and using the appropriate editing method will increase the number of pigs tested and improve the accuracy of feed intake, which will in turn increase the rate of genetic progress in swine improvement programs...|$|R

Fault location in distribution systems is a challenging task {{because of the lack of}} homogeneity in the system and due to uncertainity in the data used for estimating the faulted sections. Fuzzy logic has widely been applied for handling uncertainities in the input data and its processing. Fuzzy logic has also been used to model human expertise and decision making capabilites and to determine the possibility of a fault on a particular section. This thesis presents the design and implementation of an operated device identification algorithm to be used as one of four modules in an automated modular scheme for fault section estimation on radial distribution systems. This algorithm will be executed in tandem with the other fault location modules that form the second stage of a three stage scheme. The operated device identification algorithm can assign section fault possibilities representing the possibility of involvement of each section of a distribution feeder in an event. The operated device algorithm uses the recorded current waveform of an abnormal event, the time-current characteristics and settings of various protective devices on a feeder, and feeder topology information as inputs. The algorithm then assigns a fault possibility value to each section of a feeder using fuzzy rules and fuzzy membership functions to compare a fault event with protective device settings and characteristics. The section fault possibility values can be superimposed on the feeder map by color coding the sections of a feeder according to their fault possibility values. This helps in easy visualization of possibly faulted sections. A detailed illustration of the results obtained from running the algorithm is presented in this thesis. They prove the effectiveness of the algorithm in locating faults in a distribution feeder.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Locating the faulted section of a distribution system is a difficult task because of lack of accurate system models and the presence of uncertainty in the data used for estimating the fault section. Many of the methods used to account for the uncertainty use fuzzy logic techniques to estimate bounds of possibility of the input data and calculated quantities, or probabilistic modeling of the input data to estimate the likelihood of the location of the fault on a particular section of the feeder. Heuristic knowledge of control center dispatchers has also been used for uncertainty management. This thesis presents the design and implementation of a phase selector algorithm and a fault distance algorithm for use in an automated modular scheme for fault section estimation on radial distribution systems. These two algorithms will be executed in combination with two other fault location algorithms. The scheme is executed using the data record of an abnormal event in a three-stage scheme. The phase selector algorithm was used to obtain event-phase possibility values representing the possibility of involvement of each of the phases and the neutral in an event. A section-event possibility value that indicated the possibility that a section of the feeder was involved in the fault was evaluated using the event-phase possibility values and line section phase topology information. The fault distance algorithm was used to eliminate sections of the feeder that were not likely to be possible faulted section candidates by assuming a bolted fault and estimating its location. Each line section was assigned a fault possibility value of zero or one according to its location relative to the location of the fault. The phase selector algorithm was tested using real data <b>measured</b> at <b>feeder</b> substations and the fault distance algorithm was tested using data obtained by staging faults on a model of an overhead feeder using EMTP/ATP simulation. The results obtained from the tests were promising. A simple illustration of the combination {{of the results of the}} two algorithms is given.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis is to propose a new {{monitoring}} technique for traditional distribution system with integration of renewable energy source. The traditional distribution network is primarily composed of radial feeders, designed for unidirectional power flow. Therefore, many operation regulation, protection and control system, in distribution network, {{are based on the}} radial distribution systems assumption. The high penetration of the renewable energy sources, will clearly impact the distribution systems operation. Unlike other ways of electricity generation renewable energies initiate some challenges for grid operation. Intermittency of renewable energies sources, power system protection, stability, security, economic dispatch, optimal power flow are critical issues initiated by renewable energies penetration to power systems. In addition, the renewable energy source output may exceed the consumed power during the day. Therefore, the direction of the power flow can be reversed during some periods. The high penetration of decentralized renewable sources will create a multidirectional power flow condition in the distribution grid, which was originally designed for unidirectional power flow only. Following of this reverse power flow, the distribution feeder voltage rises. In this thesis the necessity of online monitoring system for important feeders in distribution system will be shown. It will be shown that the apparent impedance <b>measured</b> on the <b>feeder</b> has great capabilities for on line monitoring of distribution feeder.

40|$|Animals {{living in}} and {{interacting}} with natural environments must monitor {{and respond to}} changing conditions and unpredictable situations. Using information from multiple sensory systems allows them to modify their behavior in response to their dynamic environment but also creates the challenge of integrating different, and potentially contradictory, sources of information for behavior control. Understanding how multiple information streams are integrated to produce flexible and reliable behavior is key to understanding how behavior is controlled in natural settings. Natural settings are rarely still, which challenges animals that require precise body position control, like hummingbirds, which hover while feeding from flowers. Tactile feedback, available only once the hummingbird is docked at the flower, could provide additional information to help maintain its position at the flower. To investigate the role of tactile information for hovering control during feeding, we first asked whether hummingbirds physically interact with a feeder once docked. We quantified physical interactions between docked hummingbirds and a feeder {{placed in front of}} a stationary background pattern. Force sensors on the <b>feeder</b> <b>measured</b> a complex time course of loading that reflects the wingbeat frequency and bill movement of feeding hummingbirds, and suggests that they sometimes push against the feeder with their bill. Next, we asked whether the measured tactile interactions were used by feeding hummingbirds to maintain position relative to the feeder. We created two experimental scenarios—one in which the feeder was stationary and the visual background moved and the other where the feeder moved laterally in front of a white background. When the visual background pattern moved, docked hummingbirds pushed significantly harder in the direction of horizontal visual motion. When the feeder moved, and the background was stationary, hummingbirds generated aerodynamic force in the opposite direction of the feeder motion. These results suggest that docked hummingbirds are using visual information about the environment to maintain body position and orientation, and not actively tracking the motion of the feeder. The absence of flower tracking behavior in hummingbirds contrasts with the behavior of hawkmoths, and provides evidence that they rely primarily on the visual background rather than flower-based cues while feeding...|$|R
40|$|The Australian sheep {{industry}} aims {{to increase}} the efficiency of sheep production by decreasing the amount of feed eaten by sheep. Also, feed intake is related to methane production, and more efficient (low residual feed intake) animals eat less than expected. So we tested the hypothesis that more efficient sheep produce less methane by investigating the genetic correlations between feed intake, residual feed intake, methane, carbon dioxide, and oxygen. Feed intake, methane, oxygen, and carbon dioxide were measured on Merino ewes at postweaning (1, 866 at 223 d old), hogget (1, 010 sheep at 607 d old), and adult ages (444 sheep at 1, 080 d old). Sheep were fed a high-energy grower pellet ad libitum for 35 d. Individual feed intake was <b>measured</b> using automated <b>feeders.</b> Methane was <b>measured</b> using portable accumulation chambers up to 3 times during this feed intake period. Heritabilities and phenotypic and genotypic correlations between traits were estimated using ASReml. Oxygen (range 0. 10 to 0. 20) and carbon dioxide (range 0. 08 to 0. 28) were generally more heritable than methane (range 0. 11 to 0. 14). Selecting to decrease feed intake or residual feed intake will decrease methane (genetic correlation [rg] range 0. 76 to 0. 90) and carbon dioxide (rg range 0. 65 to 0. 96). Selecting to decrease intake (rg range 0. 64 to 0. 78) and methane (rg range 0. 81 to 0. 86) in sheep at postweaning age would also decrease intake and methane in hoggets and adults. Furthermore, selecting for lower residual feed intake (rg = 0. 75) and carbon dioxide (rg = 0. 90) in hoggets would also decrease these traits in adults. Similarly, selecting for higher oxygen (rg = 0. 69) in hoggets would also increase this trait in adults. Given these results, the hypothesis that making sheep more feed efficient will decrease their methane production can be accepted. In addition, carbon dioxide is a good indicator trait for feed intake because it has the highest heritability of the gas traits measured; is cheaper, faster, and easier to measure than feed intake and has strong phenotypic and genetic correlations with feed intake. Furthermore, selection for feed intake, feed efficiency, methane, and carbon dioxide can be done early in sheep at postweaning age or hoggets. This early selection reduces the generation interval for breeding, thereby increasing response to selection...|$|R
