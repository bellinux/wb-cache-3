5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} {{to have a sense}} of unpredictability so it can be played without confining the player to rules. To achieve this, the company added the breaching system, which adds more varieties of combat and gives players <b>more</b> <b>choices</b> when dealing with the artificial intelligence. The breaching system, which originated as a mini-game, {{was designed to}} be simple so it would not interrupt the flow of gameplay. Instead of being purely a first-person shooter, the game features action-adventure elements that allow players to choose their progression and tasks them with solving environmental puzzles.|$|E
5|$|Many {{aspects of}} the {{gameplay}} were reworked for this sequel. Some changes were made due to user feedback and others {{were meant to be}} included in previous games but were omitted either because of time or technological constraints. The camera was switched to the right analog stick of the DualShock controller instead of the shoulder buttons and the Gummi Ship travel was reworked. The combat system was completely redone and did not use any animations from the first game. Because Sora had matured, Nomura wanted his fighting style to reflect that. Other changes included more integration between exploration and battles. The variations in combat styles associated with each Drive Form and the introduction of the Reaction Command were added to give players <b>more</b> <b>choices</b> in battles. The inclusion of worlds based on live-action Disney films was aided by technology that generated the character models from live-action pictures.|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that higher educated twenty-somethings experience <b>more</b> <b>choice</b> overload than lower educated twenty-somethings was tested. 146 participants, either in university or in community college, filled in questionnaires asserting {{their levels of}} choice overload. As expected, higher educated (WO) twenty-somethings reported <b>more</b> <b>choice</b> overload than lower (MBO) educated twenty-somethings. Correlations were also found between choice overload and peer-pressure, student’s housing situation {{and whether or not}} students regarded themselves as adults. It was concluded that higher educated twenty-somethings indeed experience <b>more</b> <b>choice</b> overload compared to lower educated twenty-somethings...|$|R

40|$|As economists, we tend {{to accept}} the {{principle}} that <b>more</b> <b>choice</b> cannot make us worse off. However, recent evidence from laboratory and field experiments suggests that <b>more</b> <b>choice</b> can inhibit decision-making and reduce search in many situations, potentially reducing welfare. This paper provides a formal theoretical foundation for these observations by embedding the regret theory of Loomes and Sugden (1982) in three search models. Beyond a threshold number of options, we find that ‘less is more’: agents who experience regret have lower utility {{as the number of}} options is increased...|$|R
25|$|From 1962 to {{the present}} day, the main {{structure}} of Italian primary (and secondary) education remained largely unchanged, even if some modifications were made: a narrowing of the gap {{between males and females}} (through the merging of the two distinct programmes for technical education, and the optional introduction of mixed-gender gym classes), a change in the structure of secondary school (legge Berlinguer) and the creation of new licei, 'istituti tecnici' and 'istituti professionali', giving the student <b>more</b> <b>choices</b> in their paths.|$|E
25|$|Warnsdorf's rule is a {{heuristic}} {{for finding}} a knight's tour. The knight is moved {{so that it}} always proceeds to the square from which the knight will have the fewest onward moves. When calculating the number of onward moves for each candidate square, we do not count moves that revisit any square already visited. It is, of course, possible to have two or <b>more</b> <b>choices</b> for which the number of onward moves is equal; there are various methods for breaking such ties, including one devised by Pohl and another by Squirrel and Cull.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} options for rotor mounting. IS is a six-bolt mount {{and is the}} {{industry}} standard. Centerlock is patented by Shimano and uses a splined interface along with a lockring to secure the disc. The advantages of centerlock are that the splined interface is theoretically stiffer, and removing the disc is quicker because it only requires one lockring to be removed. Some of the disadvantages are that the design is patented requiring a licensing fee from Shimano. A Shimano cassette lockring tool (or an external BB tool in case of through-axle hub) is needed to remove the rotor and is more expensive and less common than a Torx key. Advantages of IS six-bolt are that there are <b>more</b> <b>choices</b> {{when it comes to}} hubs and rotors.|$|E
25|$|Giddens {{concentrates}} on a contrast between traditional (pre-modern) culture and post-traditional (modern) culture. In traditional societies, individual actions {{need not be}} extensively thought about, because available choices are already determined (by the customs, traditions, etc.). In contrast, in post-traditional society people (actors, agents) are much less concerned with the precedents set by earlier generations, and they have <b>more</b> <b>choices,</b> due to flexibility of law and public opinion. This however means that individual actions now require more analysis and thought before they are taken. Society is more reflexive and aware, something Giddens is fascinated with, illustrating it with examples ranging from state governance to intimate relationships. Giddens examines three realms in particular: the experience of identity, connections of intimacy and political institutions.|$|E
25|$|Silks {{derived from}} Bombyx mori are {{generally}} made of two parts: the silk fibroin fiber which contains a light chain of 25kDa {{and a heavy}} chain of 350kDa (or 390kDa) linked by a single disulfide bond and a glue-like protein, sericin, comprising 25 to 30 percentage by weight. Silk fibroin contains hydrophobic Beta sheet blocks, interrupted by small hydrophilic groups. And the beta-sheets contribute much to the high mechanical strength of silk fibers, which achieves 740 MPa, tens of times that of poly(lactic acid) and hundreds of times that of collagen. This impressive mechanical strength has made silk fibroin very competitive for applications in biomaterials. Indeed, silk fibers have {{found their way into}} tendon tissue engineering, where mechanical properties matter greatly. In addition, mechanical properties of silks from various kinds of silkworms vary widely, which provides <b>more</b> <b>choices</b> for their use in tissue engineering.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{androgynous}} people are able to enhance performance cross-situationally because they can alter their behaviors appropriately to becoming more “masculine” or “feminine” in the given context. According to a study, a person’s activity preference in games and interests are purely based on their gender-typed stereotypes, making the person significantly more stereotyped than androgynous people. In a self-esteem test, when individuals were given opposite-sex activities, gender-typed individuals generally felt more uncomfortable, leading to decreased levels of self-esteem. However, androgynous subjects did not feel discomfort or pessimism about themselves. Therefore, gender typing can often lead to specific gender-rule stereotypes to better facilitate decision making which can adhere to certain benefits as well as limitations. Therefore, parents who foster more non-traditional views in sex role orientation tend to encourage a less discriminatory environment. The child can then freely engage in <b>more</b> <b>choices</b> that are not affected by gender limitations. Androgynous children have been found to have higher self-esteem and higher self-worth.|$|E
25|$|The Detroit Waldorf School {{was founded}} in 1965 by Rudolf and Amelia Wilhelm, who wanted to provide Detroiters <b>more</b> <b>choices</b> in educating their children. Other private schools in the area {{at the time were}} not integrated, and the Wilhelms and their {{supporters}} sought to provide a diverse educational experience to children. The school approached the board of the Central United Methodist Church about allocating space to open a nursery school. An impassioned speech by African-American Junius Harris, where he reminded Board members that families of color had far fewer educational choices for their children, convinced the board to allow the Waldorf nursery school to open in their building. The school opened as a nursery school in the Central United Methodist Church in 1965, and was deliberatley integrated from its founding. However, space in the church was limited, and later that year the school acquired the just-vacated Liggett campus. Classes for elementary students began at the present school building in September 1966. The Detroit Waldorf School {{was one of the first}} nine Waldorf schools in North America, and a founding member of the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America (AWSNA).|$|E
25|$|Within the army, {{organisation}} {{and theory}} had no obvious link with war planning and responsibilities overlapped. The General Staff devised deployment plans and its chief became de facto Commander-in-Chief if war began but in peace, command was vested in the commanders of the twenty army corps districts. These commanders were {{independent of the}} General Staff Chief and trained soldiers {{according to their own}} devices. The German system of government was federal and the ministries of war of the constituent states controlled the forming and equipping of units, command and promotions. The system was inherently competitive and became more so after the Waldersee period, when the possibility increased of another Volkskrieg, a war of the nation in arms, rather than the few European wars fought by small professional armies, that had occurred after 1815. Schlieffen concentrated on matters he could influence and pressed for increases {{in the size of the}} army and the adoption of new weapons. A big army would create <b>more</b> <b>choices</b> about how to fight a war and better weapons would make the army more formidable. Mobile heavy artillery could help make up for numerical inferiority against a Franco-Russian coalition and smash fortifications. Schlieffen tried to make the army more operationally capable so that it was better than its potential enemies and rapidly could win a decisive victory.|$|E
