[...] "Not a minute too soon." [...] "A narrow squeak, b'gosh!" [...] He said nothing, but the breeze that had dropped came back, a gentle draught freshened steadily, and the sea joined its murmuring voice to this talkative reaction succeeding the dumb moments of awe. She was gone! She was gone! Not a doubt of it. Nobody could have helped. They repeated the same words over and over again as though they couldn't stop themselves. Never doubted she would go. The lights were gone. No mistake. The lights were gone. Couldn't expect anything else. She had to go. [...] . He noticed that they talked as though they had left behind them nothing but an empty ship. They concluded she would not have been long when she once started. It seemed to cause them some sort of satisfaction. They assured each other that she couldn't have been long about it--"Just shot down like a flat-iron." [...] The chief engineer declared that the <b>mast-head</b> <b>light</b> at the moment of sinking seemed to drop [...] "like a lighted match you throw down." [...] At this the second laughed hysterically. [...] "I am g-g-glad, I am gla-a-a-d." [...] His teeth went on [...] "like an electric rattle," [...] said Jim, [...] "and all at once he began to cry. He wept and blubbered like a child, catching his breath and sobbing 'Oh dear! oh dear! oh dear!' He would be quiet for a while and start suddenly, 'Oh, my poor arm! oh, my poor a-a-a-arm!' I felt I could knock him down. Some of them sat in the stern-sheets. I could just make out their shapes. Voices came to me, mumble, mumble, grunt, grunt. All this seemed very hard to bear. I was cold too. And I could do nothing. I thought that if I moved I would have to go over the side and [...] ." ...|$|E

He had tumbled from a height he could never scale again. By that time the boat had gone driving forward past the bows. It was too dark just then {{for them to see}} each other, and, moreover, they were blinded and half drowned with rain. He told me it was like being swept by a flood through a cavern. They turned their backs to the squall; the skipper, it seems, got an oar over the stern to keep the boat before it, and for two or three minutes {{the end of the world}} had come through a deluge in a pitchy blackness. The sea hissed [...] "like twenty thousand kettles." [...] That's his simile, not mine. I fancy there was not much wind after the first gust; and he himself had admitted at the inquiry that the sea never got up that night to any extent. He crouched down in the bows and stole a furtive glance back. He saw just one yellow gleam of the <b>mast-head</b> <b>light</b> high up and blurred like a last star ready to dissolve. [...] "It terrified me to see it still there," [...] he said. That's what he said. What terrified him was the thought that the drowning was not over yet. No doubt he wanted to be done with that abomination as quickly as possible. Nobody in the boat made a sound. In the dark she seemed to fly, but of course she could not have had much way. Then the shower swept ahead, and the great, distracting, hissing noise followed the rain into distance and died out. There was nothing to be heard then but the slight wash about the boat's sides. Somebody's teeth were chattering violently. A hand touched his back. A faint voice said, [...] "You there?" [...] Another cried out shakily, [...] "She's gone!" [...] and they all stood up together to look astern. They saw no lights. All was black. A thin cold drizzle was driving into their faces. The boat lurched slightly. The teeth chattered faster, stopped, and began again twice before the man could master his shiver sufficiently to say, [...] "Ju-ju-st in ti-ti-me. [...] . Brrrr." [...] He recognised the voice of the chief engineer saying surlily, [...] "I saw her go down. I happened to turn my head." [...] The wind had dropped almost completely.|$|E

This {{question}} of the lights being lost sight of when the boat {{could not have been}} more than a quarter of a mile from the ship was a matter for much discussion. Jim stuck to it that there was nothing to be seen after the first shower had cleared away; and the others had affirmed the same thing to the officers of the Avondale. Of course people shook their heads and smiled. One old skipper who sat near me in court tickled my ear with his white beard to murmur, [...] "Of course they would lie." [...] As a matter of fact nobody lied; not even the chief engineer with his story of the <b>mast-head</b> <b>light</b> dropping like a match you throw down. Not consciously, at least. A man with his liver in such a state might very well have seen a floating spark in the corner of his eye when stealing a hurried glance over his shoulder. They had seen no light of any sort though they were well within range, and they could only explain this in one way: the ship had gone down. It was obvious and comforting. The foreseen fact coming so swiftly had justified their haste. No wonder they did not cast about for any other explanation. Yet the true one was very simple, and as soon as Brierly suggested it the court ceased to bother about the question. If you remember, the ship had been stopped, and was lying with her head on the course steered through the night, with her stern canted high and her bows brought low down in the water through the filling of the fore-compartment. Being thus out of trim, when the squall struck her a little on the quarter, she swung head to wind as sharply as though she had been at anchor. By this change in her position all her lights were in a very few moments shut off from the boat to leeward. It may very well be that, had they been seen, they would have had the effect of a mute appeal--that their glimmer lost in the darkness of the cloud would have had the mysterious power of the human glance that can awaken the feelings of remorse and pity. It would have said, [...] "I am here--still here" [...] . and what more can the eye of the most forsaken of human beings say? But she turned her back on them as if in disdain of their fate: she had swung round, burdened, to glare stubbornly at the new danger of the open sea which she so strangely survived to end her days in a breaking-up yard, as if it had been her recorded fate to die obscurely under the blows of many hammers. What were the various ends their destiny provided for the pilgrims I am unable to say; but the immediate future brought, at about nine o'clock next morning, a French gunboat homeward bound from Reunion. The report of her commander was public property. He had swept a little out of his course to ascertain what was the matter with that steamer floating dangerously by the head upon a still and hazy sea. There was an ensign, union down, flying at her main gaff (the serang had the sense to make a signal of distress at daylight); but the cooks were preparing the food in the cooking-boxes forward as usual. The decks were packed as close as a sheep-pen: there were people perched all along the rails, jammed on the bridge in a solid mass; hundreds of eyes stared, and not a sound was heard when the gunboat ranged abreast, as if all that multitude of lips had been sealed by a spell.|$|E
60|$|Besides the {{luminaries}} which glittered in the {{sky that}} night the sea was alive with the <b>mast-head</b> <b>lights</b> of the fishing smacks, but these lower lights, unlike the serenely steady lights above, were ever changing in position, as well as dancing on the crested waves, giving life to the dark waters, and creating, {{at least in the}} little breast of Billy Bright, a feeling of companionship which was highly gratifying.|$|R
50|$|The Handyman {{lifebuoy}} {{light had}} a buoyancy chamber filled with air {{to keep it}} afloat. It {{was attached to the}} lifebuoy with a long cord, and to the boat with a shorter cord. When the lifebuoy was thrown overboard, the short cord pulled away two plugs, one to let sea water in and one to let gas out. For the <b>mast-head</b> distress signal <b>light</b> and the Deck Flare the two plugs were removed by hand and the units placed in a bucket of water.|$|R
5000|$|On 26 February 1918, Glenart Castle {{was leaving}} Newport, South Wales, heading towards Brest, France. Fishermen in the Channelsaw her clearly lit up as a {{hospital}} ship. John Hill — a fisherman on Swansea Castle — remembered [...] "I saw the Hospital Ship with green lights {{all around her}} - around the saloon. She had her red side lights showing and <b>mast-head</b> <b>light,</b> and also another red light which I suppose was the Red Cross light." [...] At 04:00, Glenart Castle {{was hit by a}} torpedo in the No. 3 hold. The blast destroyed most of the lifeboats, while the subsequent pitch of the vessel hindered attempts to launch the remaining boats. In the eight minutes the ship took to sink, only seven lifeboats were launched. Rough seas and inexperienced rowers swamped most of the boats.|$|E
