5|$|There {{is a local}} {{perception}} that Shepton Mallet has been in economic decline for some time. Some 350 <b>manufacturing</b> <b>jobs</b> {{were lost in the}} late 1990s and early years of the 21st century. However, the District Council asserts that, despite the loss of the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>jobs</b> on which Shepton Mallet has been historically dependent, more jobs in distribution, business services and public administration, health, education, quarrying, construction and hi-tech services (from companies such as the ISP Easynet) have been created, thereby creating a more balanced economy. In 2001, there were slightly more jobs in the town than economically active people, resulting in a small in-flow of workers.|$|E
5|$|Between the 1940s and the 1970s, {{the city}} saw {{significant}} growth in suburban areas from population migration.

40|$|Excerpt] America’s {{manufacturing}} {{crisis has}} hit Washington State hard. Since January 2001, Washington has experienced heavy <b>job</b> losses in <b>manufacturing</b> {{and information technology}} industries—sectors that typically provide higher wages and good benefits. As the discussion that follows shows, plant closures and layoffs associated with foreign imports and offshore outsourcing are {{a major cause of}} manufacturing’s decline in Washington State. Several factors account for <b>manufacturing</b> <b>job</b> loss in Washington and elsewhere, but there is little evidence about the role any single factor plays. Yet identifying causes and measuring their effects is important: Understanding the role of current policies in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>job</b> loss can help shape reasoned and reasonable changes that will maintain American competitiveness while creating and preserving good jobs in America...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Agent {{technology}} is widely employed to construct dynamic, distributed collaborative manufacturing systems {{in which the}} individual participating agents contribute to execute different part of the whole <b>manufacturing</b> <b>job,</b> and the final goal is achieved through cooperation. However, the cooperation among agents is based on message exchange, and the system requires additional process control and management mechanism to ensure the operation according to a pre-defined process model. This paper defines the collaborative <b>manufacturing</b> <b>job</b> and related information in domain knowledge model, and applies knowledge based expert system to build software agents for process scheduling and management. The system architecture, components and the implementation methods are discussed. A prototype system is constructed on the basis of JADE agent framework and Jess rule engine and demonstrated with an industry product as a case study...|$|R

Three canals also pass through the town, the Shropshire Union, Trent and Mersey, and the Wardle canal, as well as three major roads, the A533, A54 and A530; Middlewich also has good motorway links to the nearby cities of Manchester and Liverpool. The town's population has doubled since 1970 despite {{a reduction in the}} number of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>jobs</b> in salt and textile manufacturing, suggesting that many of the new residents live in Middlewich for reasons other than local employment.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, however, Dayton's {{population}} has declined, mainly {{due to the}} loss of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>jobs</b> and decentralization of metropolitan areas, as well as the national housing crisis that began in 2008. While much of the state has suffered for similar reasons, the impact on Dayton has been greater than most. Dayton had the third-greatest percentage loss of population in the state since the 1980s, behind Cleveland and Youngstown. Despite this, Dayton has begun diversifying its workforce from manufacturing into other growing sectors such as healthcare and education.|$|E

It is the regional center for services and trade in the county. , the city's economy is experiencing significant growth, according to the County of Okanogan. It is an agricultural community with a reliant forestry industry. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, almost 90 percent of Omak's <b>manufacturing</b> <b>jobs</b> were in the city's two sawmills. Infrastructure services and retail trades were also major industries. About 425 private firms employed a total of 3,332 workers in local industries including manufacturing, retail and infrastructure, at this time. Located within Greater Omak, the adjacent city of Okanogan serves as the administrative center for Okanogan County, the region's largest employer.|$|E
5|$|The gradual {{abandonment}} of Old Louisville by the wealthy was {{a reflection of}} changing lifestyles brought on by technology. Many homes of Old Louisville were originally built as mansions that would require several servants to maintain. Because of the relatively high wages offered by <b>manufacturing</b> <b>jobs,</b> servants were no longer affordable to all but the wealthiest families by the mid-20th century. Interurban rail lines, and increasingly automobiles, meant that the wealthy {{no longer had to}} live so close to their businesses, and many chose to live in what had previously been summer homes in the county's east end. The lifestyle that created Old Louisville was effectively obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Paris's {{manufacturing}} {{is mostly}} focused in its suburbs, {{and the city}} itself has only around 75,000 manufacturing workers, {{most of which are}} in the textile, clothing, leather goods, and shoe trades. Paris region manufacturing specialises in transportation, mainly automobiles, aircraft and trains, but this is in a sharp decline: Paris proper <b>manufacturing</b> <b>jobs</b> dropped by 64 percent between 1990 and 2010, and the Paris region lost 48 percent during the same period. Most of this is due to companies relocating outside the Paris region. The Paris region's 800 aerospace companies employed 100,000. Four hundred automobile industry companies employ another 100,000 workers: many of these are centred in the Yvelines department around the Renault and PSA-Citroen plants (this department alone employs 33,000), but the industry as a whole suffered a major loss with the 2014 closing of a major Aulnay-sous-Bois Citroen assembly plant.|$|E

5|$|Today's {{economic}} {{position is}} very different from the 1950s, when its prosperity was based on chocolate manufacturing and the railways. This position continued until the early 1980s when 30% of the workforce were employed by just five employers and 75% of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>jobs</b> were in four companies. Most industry around the railway has gone, including the carriage works (known as Asea Brown Boveri or ABB at the time of closure), which at its height in the 1880s employed 5,500 people but closed in the mid-1990s. York is the headquarters of the confectionery manufacturer Nestlé York (formerly Nestlé Rowntrees) and home to the KitKat and eponymous Yorkie bar chocolate brands. Terry's chocolate factory, makers of the Chocolate Orange, was located in the city; but it closed on 30 September 2005, when production was moved by its owners, Kraft Foods, to Poland.

As of 2016, London is home to 300 technology companies and employs 3% of the city's labour force. Many of these companies have moved into former factories and industrial spaces located in and around the downtown core, and have renovated them as modern offices. For example, Info-Tech Research Group's London office is located in a hosiery factory, and Arcane Digital moved into a 1930s industrial building in 2015. rTraction, a digital media firm, currently has its offices in the London Roundhouse, a steam locomotive repair shop built in 1887. Its redesign, which opened in 2015, won the 2015 Paul Oberman Award for Adaptive Re-Use from the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario.
