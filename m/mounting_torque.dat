50|$|The boxer design also {{provides}} near-perfect vibration mitigation because {{the movement of}} each piston is exactly countered by the corresponding piston in the opposing cylinder bank, {{eliminating the need for}} a counterbalance shaft, and that the movement of the pistons is on a horizontal plane. The only vibration caused by the boxer engine is secondary caused by the cylinders being slightly offset on opposing banks. This vibration, however, is minimal and is largely absorbed by rubber engine <b>mounts.</b> <b>Torque</b> steer is also reduced with this type of power train layout. This is achieved by having the front driveshafts being of equal weight and length, and extend from the transmission to the front wheels at almost perpendicular from the transmission.|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{rear-mounted}} engine, {{the differential}} lies between the transmission and engine, so {{drive to the}} transmission from the engine is carried forward via a hollow turbine shaft from the engine <b>mounted</b> <b>torque</b> converter to the transmission gearbox. Power from the gearbox was carried rearward again to the differential pinion gear via yet another, concentric hollow shaft of larger diameter. A small concentric shaft inside the turbine shaft operated the front pump of the transmission to permit engagement of drive/reverse ranges when the car was stopped or moving slowly; at speeds over 15 mph, a differential-driven (from the car motion) rear pump of smaller capacity and greater efficiency took over and the front pump shut down to improve fuel economy.|$|R

40|$|A {{closed loop}} spark advance control system was {{evaluated}} on a Volvo V 70 5 -cylinder spark ignited engine. The system utilises a crankshaft <b>mounted</b> <b>torque</b> sensor for combustion monitoring which provides individual cylinder combustion phasing information and enables individual cylinder spark advance control. The spark advance control system can compensate {{for changes in}} combustion operating conditions and hence limit the need for calibration. The spark advance control system was used in a mode of cylinder balancing where the control target {{is to keep the}} combustion phasing in all cylinders at a defined setpoint. This control law was evaluated in vehicle tests in an emission test chamber, running pre-defined driving cycles FTP 72 and Highway Fuel Economy Test. Analysis shows that the combustion phasing was kept close to the selected setpoint during both tests and, hence, robustness in that sense was demonstrated. The torque ratio concept is used for combustion phasing monitoring based on crankshaft torque measurements. Analysis of the 50 % torque ratio as a measure for combustion phasing shows that it is equivalent to 50 % burned mass fraction...|$|R
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} use {{a plurality}} of smaller yaw drives (usually six) to facilitate easy replacement. Such a configuration with plurality of yaw drives often offers the possibility of active yaw braking using differential torque from the yaw drives. In this case half of the yaw drives apply a small <b>mount</b> of <b>torque</b> for clockwise rotation {{and the other half}} apply torque in the opposite direction and then activate the internal magnetic brakes of the electric motor.

The experienced subjects accomplished the tasks with lower levels of Remote Manipulator System (RMS) forces than intermediate and naive subjects, but the force levels were apparently uncorrelated with {{the presence or absence of}} the display.

30|$|In {{the fourth}} part, we {{controlled}} the torque applied when securing these fixator constructs. The results suggested that, when equal torque is applied, grub screws are superior in providing stability in axial loading. The grub screw point profile may produce {{a better grip}} on the half pin than that on the bolt when the same torque is used, but when both types of screws are <b>mounted</b> applying maximum <b>torque,</b> bolts demonstrate a significantly higher threshold for loads prior to loosening. This reinforces the clinical practice to increase tightening torque in application so that an increase in clamp force is achieved and correspondingly the tolerance to load to failure.|$|R

Introduction In recent years, the time-optimal reorientation problem of a rigid spacecraft has been extensively studied by many researchers.

50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the impeller inside the torque converter, the pump is typically a gear pump <b>mounted</b> between the <b>torque</b> converter and the planetary gearset. It draws transmission fluid from a sump and pressurizes it, which is needed for transmission components to operate. The input for the pump is connected to the torque converter housing, which in turn is bolted to the engine's flexplate, so the pump provides pressure whenever the engine is running and there is enough transmission fluid, but the disadvantage is that when the engine is not running, no oil pressure is available to operate the main components of the transmission, and is thus impossible to push-start a vehicle equipped with an automatic transmission. Early automatic transmissions also had a rear pump for towing purposes, ensuring the lubrication of the rear-end components.|$|R
40|$|In {{standard}} heliostat {{design the}} usual strategy of cost reduction {{is to increase}} the mirror area of the heliostats. This leads to a reduction of specific drive cost, but also to an increase of the torques caused by the wind loads, resulting in higher specific weight and higher specific drive power. The opposite strategy focuses on the reduction of the specific weight and driving power. Therefore the mirror area is decreased. In total the drive power is much lower then, {{but it has to be}} divided into more units which means a drawback for cost reduction. A combination of both strategies is to couple small heliostats so that they can be tracked by the same drive. At the Torque Tube Heliostat (TTH) the mirrors are <b>mounted</b> on <b>torque</b> tubes to simplify the coupling mechanism for the elevation angle. The optimal tracking speed of heliostats depends on the position in the field. In a heliostat with ganged facets all facets are tracked with the same speed. This leads to higher astigmatism losses compared to independently tracked mirrors. To reduce shading a certain space is foreseen between the facets of the TTH. To achieve a high mirror density and to avoid too long and therefore too flexible torque tubes this distance is limited. Thus the shading is higher than usually. Ray tracing calculations were done to obtain optimized heliostat configurations and to estimate the energy yield of a heliostat field built of 288 m² TTHs. The results are compared to a conventional heliostat field. To get an idea of the weight reduction potential of the TTH the dimensions of the torque tube, the secondary axis tube and the mirror support structure were weight optimized via FEM. The layout criterion was a mean mirror error of 5 mrad under a wind load and gravity, which was calculated from the deviations of the FE model. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the minimum-time reorientation problem of an axi-symmetric rigid spacecraft with two independent control <b>torques</b> <b>mounted</b> perpendicular to the spacecraft symmetry axis. The objective is to reorient the spacecraft from an initial attitude, with some angular velocity, to a nal attitude with a certain angular velocity in minimum time. All possible control structures, including both singular and nonsingular arcs, are studied completely by deriving the corresponding formulae and the necessary optimality conditions. It is shown that a second order singular control {{can be part of}} the optimal trajectory. It is also shown that for an inertially symmetric and a nonspinning axi-symmetric rigid body, it is possible for in nite-order singular controls to be part of or the whole optimal trajectory. In particular, for a non-spinning axi-symmetric rigid body, the secondorder singular trajectory is shown to be an eigenaxis rotation. An e cient method for numerically solving the optimal control problem, based on a cascaded computational scheme which uses both a direct method and an indirect method, is also presented. Numerical examples demonstrate optimal reorientation maneuvers with both nonsingular and singular subarcs, and comparisons are made between eigenaxis rotations and the true time-optimal rotations...|$|R
40|$|A {{treadwheel}} <b>mounted</b> on a <b>torque</b> motor {{was used}} to study changes in step coordination {{as a function of}} the magnitude and direction of external forces resisting and assisting leg retraction. The apparent contradiction in the literature concerning the shift in the posterior extreme point is shown to depend upon the magnitude of the load. External forces resisting leg retraction generally shift step end-points rostrally and those assisting leg retraction shift them caudally, shifting leg movement so that the active muscles can provide greater force. However, this primary trend reverses for external forces equivalent to or less than the weight of the body. Together, these results indicate that the decision to end stance does not simply depend upon the leg's loading but rather on its efficiency in contributing propulsion. As expected, loads resisting leg retraction decrease retraction speed and increase step period. They also decrease protraction speed, increase swing duration and shift phase relationships of adjacent ipsilateral legs away from alternation towards a metachronal pattern. Moderate to large assisting loads evoke similar changes: they increase swing duration less but shift the phase of middle and rear legs more than the corresponding resisting loads. Thus, by itself, a reduction in the force required during retraction does not transform the gait from metachronal to tripod. The mean phase of contralateral leg pairs is unaffected by load: these legs continue to alternate...|$|R
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT) and the Discrete Element Method (DEM) {{are used}} to develop {{probability}} based models for the power draw and collision energy spectra of a tumbling mill. Experiments are conducted using dry spherical glass bead charge in a laboratory scale tumbling mill, which is <b>mounted</b> with a <b>torque</b> transducer and tachometer to measure mill power. Particle tracking information from PEPT is used to reconstruct the motion of glass beads and infer the overall charge behaviour, while DEM is employed to simulate particle motion and interaction, with collision mechanics calculated using the Hertz-Mindlin contact model. For both sets of data, the product of torque and average angular velocities in discrete cells are accumulated to obtain mill power. This method {{is found to be}} within statistical agreement with measured power for all tests. The information from both techniques is then used to develop a model for the power draw as a function of particle size, mill speed and volumetric filling. Predictions of the model match well with measured and calculated values. Based on frequency distributions of collision energies from DEM, a model for the energy spectra of each particle size per steady state mill revolution is developed. This model is found to predict collision frequencies within close agreement with DEM simulation data and follows trends consistent with existing work on tumbling mill modelling...|$|R
40|$|The {{modern era}} of tennis has seen large changes in racket design and playing style. As {{regulators}} of the game, the International Tennis Federation have assumed a role of constant investigation. Recently, impact {{models have been}} used to assess the characteristics of various rackets. Whilst existing models are powerful, they are limited in terms of impact position and racket and ball movement. Realistic shot characteristics of 13 elite level players at the 2006 Wimbledon Qualifying Tournament were obtained. Two high speed cameras running at 1, 000 frames per second were used to record ball and racket movements within a fully calibrated 2 x 2 x 2 in control volume to an accuracy of ± 2. 5 mm. It was found that players tend to hit a point on the racket stringbed which generates little to no frame vibration. Forehand shots had an outbound ball spin of 800 - 2, 200 rpm, ball velocities in the region of 25 - 40 ms'. The results from the player shot analysis were used in the design of a repeatable impact methodology. Nine hundred laboratory based racket/ball impacts were analysed in 3 D. A custom racket <b>mount</b> simulated grip <b>torque.</b> The experimental outputs were interpreted using a multi-variate fitting technique. The experimental results were used in model validation. A predictive impact model was developed. When validated against the laboratory and player testing results, the model showed good correlation. The model was used to investigate the effects of shot weighting, movement and accuracy on post-impact ball behaviour. It was found that: Increasing swing action weighting increases the velocity of tip impacts. Increasing weight towards the edge of the racket reduces the penalty for hitting off the racket's longitudinal axis. A `chopping' action generates ball spin. The model developed in this study can be incorporated into existing shot prediction software used by the International Tennis Federation...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: When {{assessing}} knee ligament injuries, clinicians {{consider the}} side-to-side difference in knee rotational-laxity {{to be an}} essential information. Although, normally, this difference is assessed through a qualitative physical examination, arthrometers are available that allow a quantitative and standardized assessmentby imposing a preset torque and by measuring the consequent femorotibial rotation. This rotation measurement is affected by uncertainties due to soft tissue deformation and to lack of control of the subject posture and muscle contraction level. Since measurements on right (R) and left (L) knees are carried out in separate tests, relevant results can be affected by different uncertainties that reflect on an inaccurate assessment of side-to-side differences. The aim {{of the present study}} was to overcome this limitation by designing and validating a non-invasive bilateral rotational kneearthrometer (BiRKA) that allows the simultaneous assessment of both knees while the subject assumes a symmetrical, controllable, and reproducible posture and minimizes soft tissue artifacts. Materials and methods: The BiRKA consists of ametal frame on which a compound pulley is <b>mounted.</b> A <b>torque,</b> the magnitude of which can be adjusted through a dynamometric lever, is applied to a central pulley and equally transferred to two pulleys the axes of which are aligned with the longitudinal axes of the subject’s tibias. The latter pulleys, which can rotate independently, are connected to the subject shanks through two modified Aircast boots which minimize ankle movement and soft tissue artifacts. The rotation of each pulley [ [...] . ] is measured by means of an electronic goniometer and an estimate of the difference [ [...] . ] between the R and L knee rotation is made available. The device allows the generation of both internal and external torques with the patient in either supine or prone position with different knee joint flexion angles. For validation purposes, measurements were carried out with the subject prone on a table with the knees flexed at 30 ◦. Belts were used to fasten the subject to the table. Accuracy assessment – Two subjects, with no apparent deficit at their knees, underwent simultaneous computed tomography scanning (CT) and BiRKA assessment. The CT scan provided benchmark values of knee rotation and the difference between these values and those provided by the BiRKA was assumed to be an estimate of the inaccuracy of the latter device. Two loading conditions were tested (external torque = 0 and 10 Nm). Repeatability assessment – Three subjects were assessed by the same operator three times in three different days (external torque = 10 Nm). Results: Accuracy – Femorotibial rotation angles were consistently overestimated by the BiRKA and, within each subject, R and L errors were comparable. The [ [...] . ] values measured using the CT scans and the BiRKA differed by 1. 1 ° for S 1 and 3 ° for S 2. Repeatability – The mean absolute deviation of was [ [...] . ] 1. 3 °, 0. 3 °, 1. 1 ° for the three subjects, respectively. Discussion : A non invasive device able to measure the sideto-side difference in knee rotational-laxity has been presented. Preliminary results have shown accuracy and repeatability levels that are adequate to reveal the presence and severity of knee lesions. Due to the presence of soft tissue deformation and undesired movement of adjacent joints, the actual femorotibial rotations were overestimated by the device. However, the inaccuracies that affected R and L knee rotations were similar and cancelled each other thus allowing for a reliable side-to-side difference evaluation. </br...|$|R
