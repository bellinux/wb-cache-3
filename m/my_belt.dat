500|$|These insults {{culminated in}} an altercation {{between the two}} on March 16, 2003, at Pride 25. Following a victory over Kevin Randleman, Jackson was given the {{microphone}} and started talking directly to Silva, who was sitting at ringside, saying [...] "I want you boy. It's gonna be me and you." [...] Silva immediately {{jumped to his feet}} and made his way into the ring. He was now face-to-face with Jackson, who continued by saying, [...] "You have <b>my</b> <b>belt,</b> you're keeping it warm for me." [...] Silva responded by yelling [...] "MY BELT!" [...] and giving Jackson a forceful shove. Jackson, visibly upset, advanced towards Silva as dozens of Pride officials intervened. Jackson stood still as he was surrounded by officials, while Silva had to be constantly restrained from charging at Jackson. Jackson later stated that he was instructed by Pride executives to make these comments. He added that Silva's shove infuriated him, and he was ready to fight Silva immediately.|$|E
500|$|Early in his career, West {{made clear}} his {{interest}} in fashion and desire {{to work in the}} clothing design industry. In September 2005, West announced that he would release his Pastelle Clothing line in spring 2006, claiming [...] "Now that I have a Grammy under <b>my</b> <b>belt</b> and Late Registration is finished, I am ready to launch my clothing line next spring." [...] The line was developed over the following four years – with multiple pieces teased by West himself – before the line was ultimately cancelled in 2009. In 2009, West collaborated with Nike to release his own shoe, the Air Yeezys, with a second version released in 2012. In January 2009, West introduced his first shoe line designed for Louis Vuitton during Paris Fashion Week. The line was released in summer 2009. West has additionally designed shoewear for Bape and Italian shoemaker Giuseppe Zanotti. In fall 2009 West moved to Rome and did an internship at Italian fashion brand Fendi where he gave ideas for the men's collection. In March 2011, West collaborated with M/M Paris for a series of silk scarves featuring artwork from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.|$|E

60|$|Seizing my cutlass, and {{thrusting}} a brace of pistols in <b>my</b> <b>belt,</b> I rushed on deck.|$|E
60|$|Gons. Come, I'll employ you both; Reach me <b>my</b> <b>belt,</b> {{and help}} to put it on.|$|E
60|$|I {{offered him}} one of my hatpins. But he said no. He has taken instead the diamond buckle from <b>my</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>My</b> money <b>belt</b> is gone. They came while I was asleep, {{and when}} I woke up both hit me,--and I don't know what {{happened}} after that. I just came to my senses and found myself locked in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True," [...] {{returned}} the trooper, observing {{that he had}} brought bundle and all from the ground. [...] "I perceive that you belong to the baggage guard; but <b>my</b> sword <b>belt</b> will encircle your little waist, {{as well as my}} own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think, {{if there}} were a hundred garrisons in danger," [...] Hallett laughed, [...] "it would affect my sleep in the slightest. I lie down as soon as I have eaten what there is to eat, which {{certainly}} is not likely to affect my digestion; and however rough the ground, I am dead asleep as soon as my head touches it, and I do not open an eye until the bugle sounds in the morning. Even then I have not had enough sleep, and I always indulge in bad language as I put on <b>my</b> <b>belts,</b> at the unearthly hour at which we are always called. I don't begin to feel half awake till we have gone some miles." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{an instant}} I drew my pistol from <b>my</b> <b>belt,</b> which, in {{anticipation}} of some such outrage, I always carried, and shot him.|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank you, Glinda," [...] responded Dorothy gratefully, as {{she placed}} the ring on her finger. [...] "I'm going to wear <b>my</b> Magic <b>Belt</b> which I took from the Nome King, too, so I guess I'll be safe from {{anything}} the Skeezers and Flatheads try to do to me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to march this army through an {{underground}} tunnel, which I am going to bore, to the Emerald City of Oz.

6000|$|... "The king is good; he {{sees that}} <b>my</b> <b>belt</b> is drawn tight; he {{satisfies}} my hunger. Will the king suffer that I go? My wife is in labour and I would visit her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before I had put {{my watch}} back in <b>my</b> <b>belt,</b> {{the means of}} extricating myself from the frightful {{position}} I was placed in showed themselves to me as plainly as I see them now.|$|E

5000|$|Last {{entry in}} the diary is dated April 9, 1940: “Five a.m. From the very morning the day began in an unusual way. We are taken somewhere in a prison {{ambulance}} (terrible!) We were brought to a forest, to a location that resembles a summer resort. Here, we are carefully checked. My watch was taken away from me at 6:30 in the morning. They asked me about my ring, which (....) They took away <b>my</b> roubles, <b>belt</b> and pocket knife (...) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's glad I am {{to be on}} {{the move}} again, Captain Kennedy," [...] the soldier said, as they rode away. [...] "Sure, your honour, idleness is not good for a man, {{especially}} when he has lashings of the best of food and drink. When I came to buckle on <b>my</b> sword <b>belt,</b> this morning, I found it would not meet within three inches, and the coatee is so tight that I feel as if I was suffocated." ...|$|R
60|$|Then I {{first noticed}} that another person {{was in the}} hut, a slim young girl, who had been seated against the wall {{on the other side}} of the fire, {{partially}} hid by the shadows. She had <b>my</b> leather <b>belt,</b> with the revolver in its case, and my hunting-knife attached, and the few articles I had had in my pockets, on her lap. Taking up the pouch, she handed it to him, and he clutched it with a strange eagerness.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Billie--that was no lie: it {{was quite}} true. But, then, these blackguards were cowards at bottom, and they saw that I'd got a brace o' double-barrelled pistols in <b>my</b> <b>belt,</b> and was pretty well up in the cutlass exercise." ...|$|E
6000|$|As she spoke, Lance Outram re-entered the cottage. [...] "Naunt," [...] {{he said in}} dismay, [...] "I {{doubt it}} is true what she says. The beacon tower is as black as <b>my</b> <b>belt.</b> No Pole-star of Peveril. What does that betoken?" ...|$|E
60|$|Fortunately, I had my loaded {{revolver}} in <b>my</b> <b>belt.</b> Though {{we had not}} in {{the least}} anticipated this sudden revolt--it broke like a thunder-clap from a clear sky--the unsettled state of the country made even women go armed about their daily avocations.|$|E
6000|$|In view of {{the sequel}} of this little story, be it here narrated how it came to pass, that an object which partly from its being so small was quite lost to every other man on board, still {{caught the eye of}} my {{handspike}} companion. The rest of the crew, myself included, merely stood up to our spikes in heaving, whereas, unwontedly exhilarated, at every turn of the ponderous windlass, <b>my</b> <b>belted</b> comrade leaped atop of it, with might and main giving a downward, thewey, perpendicular heave, his raised eye bent in cheery animation upon the slowly receding shore. Being high lifted above all others was the reason he perceived the object, otherwise unperceivable; and this elevation of his eye was owing to the elevation of his spirits; and this again--for truth must out--to a dram of Peruvian pisco, in guerdon for some kindness done, secretly administered to him that morning by our mulatto steward. Now, certainly, pisco does a deal of mischief in the world; yet seeing that, in the present case, it was the means, though indirect, of rescuing a human being from the most dreadful fate, must we not also needs admit that sometimes pisco does a deal of good? ...|$|R
5000|$|Sheridan's {{friendship}} with Princess Diana came with much controversy {{because of the}} nature in which the relationship was handled. Following a car accident, Sheridan made an unexpected recovery following massive injuries and received a visit from her friend Diana, whom Sheridan told, [...] "Thank God I was wearing <b>my</b> seat <b>belt.</b> If only Diana had been wearing hers".

60|$|The last benches of that ridge taxed my waning strength. I {{had to step}} up, climb up, pull myself up, by {{hand and}} knee and body. My rifle grew to weigh a ton. <b>My</b> {{cartridge}} <b>belt</b> was a burden of lead around my waist. If I had been hot and wet below in the thicket I wondered what I grew on the last steps of this ridge. Yet even the toil and the pain held a keen pleasure. I did not analyze my feelings then, but {{it was good to}} be there.|$|R
