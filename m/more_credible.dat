5|$|In {{addition}} to archaeological evidence, Zenobia's life {{was recorded in}} different ancient sources but many are flawed or fabricated; the Augustan History, a late-Roman collection of biographies, is the most notable (albeit unreliable) source for the era. The author (or authors) of the Augustan History invented many events and letters attributed to Zenobia {{in the absence of}} contemporary sources. Some Augustan History accounts are corroborated from other sources, and are <b>more</b> <b>credible.</b> Byzantine chronicler Joannes Zonaras is considered an important source for the life of Zenobia.|$|E
5|$|Savoye, {{comparing}} {{the structure of}} Live and Let Die with Casino Royale, believes that the two books have open narratives which allow Fleming to continue with further books in the series. Savoye finds differences {{in the structure of}} the endings, with Live and Let Dies promise of future sexual encounters between Bond and Solitaire to be <b>more</b> <b>credible</b> than Casino Royales ending, in which Bond vows to battle a super-criminal organisation.|$|E
5|$|Sources often {{considered}} <b>more</b> <b>credible</b> than the Augustan History include the contemporary historians Cassius Dio and Herodian. Cassius Dio lived {{from the second}} half of the 2nd century until sometime after 229. Born into a patrician family, he spent the greater part of his life in public service. He was a senator under emperor Commodus and governor of Smyrna after the death of Septimius Severus. Afterwards he served as suffect consul around 205, and as proconsul in Africa and Pannonia.|$|E
40|$|Raewyn Campbell {{considers}} {{the role of}} nerdom in narratives about contemporary gender roles, noting that males are <b>more</b> culturally <b>credible</b> as nerds than are women. As male nerds are largely validated through conforming to notions of hegemonic masculinity, female nerds are unable to sit comfortably within this paradigm...|$|R

The company's cars set 72 USAC records in September, and raised that to 337 the {{following}} month.

5000|$|Deliberative Democracy {{can lead}} to <b>more</b> legitimate, <b>credible,</b> and {{trustworthy}} outcomes. Deliberative Democracy allows for [...] "a wider range of public knowledge," [...] {{and it has been}} argued that this {{can lead to}} [...] "more socially intelligent and robust" [...] science. One major shortcoming of deliberative democracy is that many models insufficiently ensure critical interaction.|$|R
5|$|Thurstan {{travelled}} to Rome, {{as did the}} Archbishop of Canterbury, William de Corbeil, {{and both}} presumably opposed David's request. David however gained the support of King Henry, and the Archbishop of York agreed to a year's postponement of the issue and to consecrate Robert of Scone without making an issue of subordination. York's claim over bishops north of the Forth were in practice abandoned {{for the rest of}} David's reign, although York maintained her <b>more</b> <b>credible</b> claims over Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|However, the two western towers left of {{the church}} display an unusual detail in the painting. The uniformly proportioned, large, square windows {{depicted}} there {{are associated with the}} Italian Renaissance, which was introduced in Sweden in 1572 during reconstruction of Kalmar Castle. While the construction works of Gustav Vasa are poorly documented, the presence of these windows in Stockholm in 1535 is unlikely. It seems <b>more</b> <b>credible</b> that this part of the painting had been damaged before 1632, forcing the copyist to rely on another source. As the two square and crenellated towers in the painting are depicted much as they appear on a copperplate of Stockholm produced by Frantz Hogenberg around 1560–1570, the painting thus probably renders this part of the castle as it appeared while the reconstruction was still under way, before its completion in the 1580s.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins and}} {{evolutionary}} {{relationships between the}} three main groups of amphibians are hotly debated. A molecular phylogeny based on rDNA analysis dating from 2005 suggests that salamanders and caecilians are {{more closely related to}} each other than they are to frogs and the divergence of the three groups took place in the Paleozoic or early Mesozoic before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe-finned fishes. This would help account for the relative scarcity of amphibian fossils from the period before the groups split. Another molecular phylogenetic analysis conducted about the same time concluded that lissamphibians first appeared about 330 million years ago and that the temnospondyl-origin hypothesis is <b>more</b> <b>credible</b> than other theories. The neobatrachians seemed to have originated in Africa/India, the salamanders in East Asia and the caecilians in tropical Pangaea. Other researchers, while agreeing with the main thrust of this study, questioned the choice of calibration points used to synchronise the data. They proposed that the date of lissamphibian diversification should be placed in the Permian, rather less than 300 million years ago, a date in better agreement with the palaeontological data. A further study in 2011 using both extinct and living taxa sampled for morphological, as well as molecular data, {{came to the conclusion that}} Lissamphibia is monophyletic and that it should be nested within Lepospondyli rather than within Temnospondyli. The study postulated that Lissamphibia originated no earlier than the late Carboniferous, some 290 to 305 million years ago. The split between Anura and Caudata was estimated as taking place 292 million years ago, rather later than most molecular studies suggest, with the caecilians splitting off 239 million years ago.|$|E

The word Dhakka means watchtower. Bikrampur and Sonargaon—the earlier strongholds of Bengal rulers were situated nearby. So Dhaka was most likely used as the watchtower for the fortification purpose.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{popularity}} of the writer was still rising (the German Brockhaus Enzyklopädie devoted an article to him as early as 1934,) B. Traven remained a mysterious figure.

25|$|The {{print media}} in India and abroad was largely {{sympathetic}} to the Indian cause, with editorials in newspapers based {{in the west and}} other neutral countries observing that Pakistan was largely responsible for the conflict. Some analysts believe that Indian media, which was both larger in number and <b>more</b> <b>credible,</b> may have acted as a force multiplier for the Indian military operation in Kargil and served as a morale booster. As the fighting intensified, the Pakistani version of events found little backing on the world stage. This helped India gain valuable diplomatic recognition for its position.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 Conference in Blackpool was {{dominated}} by the governance review debate and vote. The proposals were for a restructuring of {{the running of the}} Union but the vote was lost by 25 votes (a two-thirds majority was required). The review was criticised for what was felt by detractors to be an attack on the organisation's democratic accountability. Its supporters however defended the review as providing a more 'innovative' corporate structure which was hoped to make it <b>more</b> <b>credible</b> in negotiating policy, rather than simply 'reactive'. This was not well received by many in the executive with President, Gemma Tumelty, vowing to press ahead with reform. The perceived lack of progress on governance reform has also prompted Imperial College Union to hold a referendum on disaffiliation.|$|E

25|$|Precise {{figures for}} {{the size of the}} armies involved, and the number of {{casualties}} suffered, are difficult to know. Such figures have always been a powerful propaganda weapon, and are thus suspect. Caesar, in his De Bello Gallico, refers to a Gallic relief force of a quarter of a million, probably an exaggeration to enhance his victory. Unfortunately, the only records of the events are Roman and therefore presumably biased. Modern historians usually believe that a number between 80,000–100,000 men is <b>more</b> <b>credible.</b> The only known fact is that each man in Caesar's legions received a Gaul as a slave, which means at least 40,000 prisoners, mostly from the besieged garrison. Only The Arverni and Aedui prisoners kept their freedom thanks to their valor. The relief force probably suffered heavy losses, like many other armies who lost battle order and retreated under the weapons of the Roman cavalry.|$|E
25|$|During the attack, two Irgun {{casualties}} occurred, Avraham Abramovitz and Itzhak Tsadok. In one Irgun {{account of}} the bombing, by Katz, the two were shot during the initial approach on the hotel, when a minor gunfight ensued with two British soldiers who had become suspicious. The Irgun did not explain how the group {{would have been able}} to move 350kg of home-made explosives into the hotel with the guards already alerted. In Yehuda Lapidot's account, the men were shot as they were withdrawing after the attack. The latter agrees with the version of events presented by Bethell and Thurston Clarke and is <b>more</b> <b>credible.</b> According to Bethell, Abramovitz managed to get to the taxi getaway car along with six other men. Tsadok escaped with the other men on foot. Both were found by the police in the Jewish Old Quarter of Jerusalem the next day, with Abramovitz already dead from his wounds.|$|E
25|$|Fair City enjoys {{consistently}} high official viewing statistics. The viewing {{figures for}} each episode are around 500,000 – 600,000 and rise to 700,000 {{or more for}} specials. The soap is hugely popular with viewers outside of Dublin. It attracts the highest audiences for any drama on Irish television, beating stalwart British imports such as Coronation Street, Emmerdale and EastEnders in the ratings. The launch show attracted 1.06 million viewers. On 21 November 2001, Fair City attracted 840,000 viewers who tuned in to see Billy Meehan being killed by Lorcan Foley. 660,000 viewers tuned in to watch Sylvester Garrigan get shot on 19 January 2006. 731,000 viewers watched on 23 November 2010 to see the latest development featuring battered husband Damien Halpin. The show was not an instant ratings success in {{the first couple of}} seasons, but became more favourable in subsequent seasons, when there were strong story lines centring on the Doyle and Molloy families. The serial was not initially a critical success, but it has received acclaim recently for its <b>more</b> <b>credible,</b> sophisticated and psychological stories under executive producer Brigie de Courcy.|$|E
5000|$|The album spawned four singles, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Golden Quartet. [...] "Better the Devil You Know" [...] became one of Minogue's biggest successes, charting inside the top twenty in Israel, Australia, United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden and France. The music video generated a more sexual image to her career. Minogue promoted the album with her Rhythm of Love Tour in Australia and Asia. The album is {{considered by many to be}} a definitive turning point in Minogue's career, noted for successfully beginning a departure from the bubblegum pop sound of her first two albums and showing her as a <b>more</b> mature, <b>credible</b> musical adult artist.|$|R
