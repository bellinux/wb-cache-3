40|$|The {{habitat of}} Osmoderma eremita, a European {{endangered}} beetle species restricted to tree cavities, was examined in central Italy, at the southernmost limit of its distributional range. The occurrence of adults, larvae, and fragments {{was investigated in}} 170 and 151 living hollow trees by pitfall trapping and sampling of <b>wood</b> <b>mould</b> (i. e., loose material) in the hollow, respectively.

The money registry was located at the east end of the lobby, the stair wrapping around the elevator cage was at the west end. There was a short lobby extension from the stair northward to provide additional postal windows and give access to the postmaster's office at the northwest corner of the floor. A vault was placed at each end of the floor, one for the money registry and one for the postmaster. There was also a single occupancy toilet at each end of the floor. The mailing vestibule occupied the center position of the postal workroom's north wall. Although it was a construction alternate, the lobby was finished with light colored terrazzo with marble divisions and borders at the floor and wall base. The walls had stained wood wainscoting, postal windows, grills, and door casings with painted plaster above. The interior entry vestibule (center door pair only) was constructed of stained wood and glass and had two wood and glass doors. The ceiling of the lobby had ornamental plaster crown mouldings. The main stairway was constructed with grey marble treads and iron railings, stringers and risers. The original traction elevator had a steel grill enclosure and metal hoist way entrance doors with wire glass relights. The postal lobby finishes were duplicated on the second and third floor lobbies (also a construction alternate) except for the ornamental ceiling plaster. Upper lobbies were centered axially on the stair and elevator which allowed a row of offices along the south wall. The courtroom space occupied the north side of the lobby and extended through the third floor. This courtroom was finished modestly with wall coverings, smooth painted plaster, and stained wood mouldings and furnishings.

In addition, it was indicated that the susceptibility cannot be described by one single parameter, but also depends on other parameters. It is therefore difficult to estimate the susceptibility of wood in general.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{endangered}} assemblage of species in Europe is represented by saproxylic beetles associated with old trees, as this habitat has decreased severely in Europe during the last 200 years. This thesis contains the first quantitative studies of the population status, the habitat characteristics and the dispersal patterns of Osmoderma eremita in Mediterranean woodlands, at the southernmost limit of its distribution range, i. e. central Italy. Pitfall traps, associated with visual encounter surveys, resulted to be the optimal method to assess the species presence and to obtain reliable population size estimates. Differently from northern Europe, where the demographic structure of this species has been explained by the metapopulation approach, at the southernmost limit of its distribution range a single hollow tree may host only a reduced number of individuals, which do not represent a population in itself, and a single population is widespread on the landscape. The frequency of presence was higher in cavities with more than 4 l of <b>wood</b> <b>mould,</b> in cavities with dry or half-moist <b>wood</b> <b>mould</b> rather than wet <b>wood</b> <b>mould,</b> and with a low soil contamination. A comparison with northern regions indicated that the warmer macroclimatic conditions in the south made the species independent on sun exposure. As most of the hollow trees contained {{only a small amount}} of <b>wood</b> <b>mould</b> (< 4 l), the habitat quality was generally poorer than in the oak pastures studied in northern Europe. Telemetered beetles spent their life time not only inside hollow trees but also in other habitats, such as on the ground surface and under the ground level. Beetles were more active {{at the beginning of the}} season. Even though 81 % of the males and 69 % of the females conducted dispersals during their life-time, the dispersal distance over individuals’ life-time did not differ between sexes. The longest dispersal was conducted by a female that moved 1504 m, and power function predicts that 9. 7 % of beetles move distances farther than 1600 m. Both dispersal rate and range are higher than what has been found in northern Europe. Since the population size per tree is low, the habitat quality is generally poor and a high predation rate (at least 28 %) was observed in dispersing beetles, conservation efforts for this species should not focus on preserving few and isolated monumental hollow trees, but should be extended to large stands...|$|R

Dead hen was the substrate with the highest number of species, although differences were small. In conclusion, a large number of species, including red listed ones and saproxylic specialists used the boxes. A dead hen in the box gave some extra species and 1800 meters was too long for some of the species to disperse.

We studied the beetle assemblages of 111 Quercus species tree hollows in four protected areas of the Iberian Peninsula.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{endangered}} assemblages of species in Europe is saproxylic beetles associated with old trees. To be able to conserve these species {{there is a need}} of developing methods to survey the fauna and to evaluate the conservation value of different oak habitats, develop instruments for landscape planning and detailed knowledge of species habitat requirements. The results are based on a data set from window and pit-fall trapping of saproxylic beetles at 94 different sites spread over four regions in southern Sweden. Additionally, 48 wooden boxes with artificial <b>wood</b> <b>mould,</b> consisting mainly of oak saw dust and oak leaves and some varying additional substrates, were studied for three years at three of the sites and their vicinities. A comparison of three methods to assess species richness and composition of the saproxylic beetle fauna in standing hollow oaks showed that all trapping methods were effective in detecting species, but as they partially target different assemblages of species it is profitable to combine the methods. Window traps gave most species but <b>wood</b> <b>mould</b> sampling is the cheapest method to sample the fauna. It was possible to predict the conservation value individual oak patches with sets of indicator species of saproxylic beetles with regard to number of species or presence of conservation priority species. Indicator sets of species effectively caught with pitfall traps gave the overall best predictions. When comparing different treatment of species indata, the explanatory power of predictions was strongest for presence/absence data. Predictions of species number and an index worked well within the same regions but gave varied result for three other regions, which shows that transferability of indicators between regions may be doubtful. Species richness was greatest in stands with large, free-standing trees. Among individual trees, large girth as well as low canopy cover, increased frequency of occurrence for several species. Forest regrowth was found to be detrimental for many beetle species. An evaluation of to what extent artificial habitats, mimicking the conditions in hollow oaks, can be exploited by saproxylic beetles showed that nearly 70 % of the species found in hollow oaks was found in artificial <b>wood</b> <b>mould</b> boxes. A dead hen added to the artificial <b>wood</b> <b>mould</b> gave a higher number of beetle specimens. The number of species associated with tree hollows in oak decreased with distance from sites with hollow oaks. An analysis of species assemblages at 38 sites and positions of 33 000 large/hollow oaks showed that different beetle species dependent on a single substrate, hollow oaks, responded to different scales. The total species richness responded to a scale of 859 m and the characteristic scale of response for single species varied between 52 m and 5284 m. Several species were sensitive both to smaller and larger scales. As most sites with endangered beetles living in old oaks are small and isolated, ongoing management directed to keep old oaks free standing and sun exposed and to ensure the recruitment of young oaks, and the restoration of abandoned pasture woodlands should have a high priority in nature conservation. Artificial habitats may in critical areas be created to fill gaps in old oak habitat for parts of the species assemblage. To preserve the saproxylic beetle fauna dependent on old oaks, it is important to retain and create suitable habitats both in local stands and at the landscape level, from single hectares up to hundreds of hectares depending on the species. In some landscape, creations of new oak areas in the fragmented landscape are crucial for long-term survival of sensitive species...|$|R
500|$|A three-bedroom {{apartment}} with an outdoor pool was created, and the bedrooms {{were designed to}} suit their occupants. After toying with colours for the Verve office, Mahal decided to make it black and used four colours for the apartment. Her team gave the furniture a Victorian look; Mahal {{was pleased with the}} chandeliers, which she considered lavish for an office. Construction of the [...] "Desi Girl" [...] set, the last to be built, was stressful because of its light-generated heat. Over 100 sketches were drawn to reach the final version, which used plaster of Paris, <b>moulding</b> fibre and <b>wood.</b> A dance floor was surrounded by tables and chairs for a stage-like appearance.|$|R
40|$|The genus Aureobasidium, {{which is}} known as a <b>wood</b> {{staining}} <b>mould,</b> has been detected on oil treated woods in the specific stain formation called biofinish. This biofinish is used to develop a new protective, self-healing and decorative biotreatment for wood. In order to understand and control biofinish formation on oil treated wood, the occurrence of different Aureobasidium species on various wood surfaces was studied. Phenotypic variability within Aureobasidium strains presented limitations of morphological identification of Aureobasidium species. PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of ITS and RPB 2 were used to identify the culturable Aureobasidium species composition in <b>mould</b> stained <b>wood</b> surfaces with and without a biofinish. The analysed isolates showed that several Aureobasidium species were present and that Aureobasidium melanogenum was predominantly detected, regardless of the presence of a biofinish and the type of substrate. A. melanogenum was detected on wood samples exposed in the Netherlands, Cameroon, South Africa, Australia and Norway. ITS-specific PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of DNA extracted from biofinish samples confirmed results of the culturing based method: A. melanogenum is predominant within the Aureobasidium population of biofinishes on pine sapwood treated with raw linseed oil and the outdoor placement in the Netherlands...|$|R
40|$|Tree hollows are {{keystone}} {{structures for}} saproxylic fauna and host numerous endangered species. However, not all tree hollows are equal. Many variables including physical, biotic and chemical ones, can characterise a tree hollow, however, {{the information that}} these could provide about the saproxylic diversity they harbour has been poorly explored. We studied the beetle assemblages of 111 Quercus species tree hollows in four protected areas of the Iberian Peninsula. Three physical variables related to tree hollow structure, and two biotic ones (presence of Cetoniidae and Cerambyx species recognised as ecosystem engineers) were measured in each hollow to explore their relative effect on beetle assemblages. Moreover, we analysed the chemical composition of the <b>wood</b> <b>mould</b> in 34 of the hollows, in order to relate beetle diversity with hollow quality. All the environmental variables analysed (physical and biological) showed a significant influence on saproxylic beetle assemblages that varied depending on the species. Furthermore, the presence of ecosystem engineers affected both physical and chemical features. Although <b>wood</b> <b>mould</b> volume, and both biotic variables could act as beetle diversity surrogate, we enhance the presence of Cetoniidae and Cerambyx activity (both easily observable in the field) as indicator variables, even more if both co-occur as each affect to different assemblages. Finally, assimilable carbon and phosphorous contents could act as indicator for past and present beetle activity inside the cavity that could become a useful tool in functional diversity studies. However, an extension of this work to other taxonomic groups would be desirable.
