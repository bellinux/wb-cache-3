40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the study and {{development}} of innovative techniques for the synthesis of antennas able to fulfill the tight requirements of modern wireless communication systems. By exploiting the advantages given {{by the use of}} geometries based on spline and fractal shapes, the aim of the proposed synthesis techniques is the design of small Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and <b>multi-band</b> <b>antennas.</b> The synthesis of UWB antennas is carried out by means of two different approaches which consider the antenna characterization in the frequency and in the time domain, respectively. The antenna structure is based on a spline representation which allows the description of complex contour by means of a limited set of control parameters. Regarding the synthesis of <b>multi-band</b> <b>antennas,</b> an approach based on the perturbation of fractal geometries is proposed. The perturbation breaks the fixed relationships among resonances typical of standard fractal geometries, allowing the use of fractal antennas for practical applications. By exploiting the knowledge acquired during the synthesis of UWB spline-shaped antennas, a preliminary assessment of an approach for the design of <b>multi-band</b> <b>antennas</b> with spline-based geometries is also reported. Finally, the integration of UWB antennas in array layouts is addressed. Towards this end, first a methodology for the design of aperiodic UWB linear arrays populated by spline-shaped radiating elements is proposed.

The proposed <b>multi-band</b> <b>antenna</b> is developed from the initial v-shaped design which is only capable of working as a single-band antenna. By deploying a concept of dipole antenna to an initial design, the proposed antenna is accomplished to operate with two different modes of RFID system which are passive and active modes at frequencies of 915 MHz and 2. 45 GHz respectively. The passive RFID tag is invented when a chip of Ultra High Frequency (UHF) is integrated with a proposed <b>multi-band</b> <b>antenna.</b> This passive tag, which is able to radiate with the measured signal strength, shows that the reading ranges are boosted almost two times compared to the conventional inlay antenna. The maximum reading range of passive RFID tag with inlay antenna is 5 m, though a reading range up to 10 m is achievable through the deployment of the proposed antenna at a measurement field. Implicitly, the measurements carried out on the antenna are in good agreement with the simulated values. Moreover, {{the size of the}} mobile passive RFID tag has been substantially as 100 mm × 70 mm, even though the antenna is fabricated with an inexpensive FR- 4 substrate material.
