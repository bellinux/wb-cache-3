5000|$|Scottish {{immigrant}} John MacKay {{created a}} new hot cereal product called [...] "cream of barley". In 1884 he bought the preexisting Caledonia Mill, situated {{on the banks of}} Soper Creek {{on the outskirts of the}} town of Bowmanville, to manufacture his product. The mill was originally built in 1805 by Leonard Soper as a grist mill, and was owned and operated by several others before being bought by McKay. McKay designed and installed new equipment for the <b>milling</b> <b>of</b> <b>barley.</b>|$|E

There can be described a weight part or percentage of flour from every stage of breaking, scratch and reduction. The similar flow diagram can be drawn expressing the ash content in every of flour streams <b>of</b> a whole <b>milling</b> flow. A <b>milling</b> flow <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> is considerably {{different from that of}} wheat and to some part also from rye mill flow. Currently, high-yielding naked barley cultivars are preferred in the Western world, and they can be used in products where outstanding starch or non-starch polysaccharide properties are required. The aim of this work was to assess the milling results with regard to the yield of single streams in connection with their chemical composition, especially β-glucans (fiber) content. Barley sample was naked <b>barley</b> <b>of</b> Czech origin of crop 2010. The balance tables showing the yield of β-glucans and ash in single streams were compiled. Resulting data were judged in comparison to the milling flow with the purpose to recommend the parameters and best streams <b>of</b> <b>milling</b> flow as a source of special nutritionally lucrative products...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The study aims to {{determine}} the effect <b>of</b> supplementation <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> to mild hypercholesterolemic adults. Cardiovascular disease {{is one of the most}} common causes of death in the developing countries. The soluble β – glucan <b>of</b> oats and <b>barley</b> is considered to be due to cholesterol reduction in animals and humans. A sample size of 20 individuals has been taken with the age limit of 40 to 60 years for this research. The supplementation <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> bun containing 40 grams <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> is recommended for these samples for 60 days. It has been observed that the cholesterol level is nailed down by 10 to 12 % in 60 days, due to the uninterrupted supplementation <b>of</b> <b>Barley</b> to the selected samples. Hence it was found that supplementation <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> would cause a significant reduction in the cholesterol levels with no side effects but good for health is acceptable...|$|R

Water extracts five varieties <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> were bioassayed on germination and seedling growth of wild-oat {{to test the}} heterotoxicity <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> on wild-oat, study the dynamics of allelopathic potential over four growth stages and identify the most allelopathic plant part <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> in each stage. Whole barley plants were extracted at growth stage 4 (stems not developed enough), whilst for the following growth stages roots, stems, panicles and leaves were extracted separately. Seedling growth bioassays demonstrated that the wild-oat responded differently to the allelopathic potential <b>of</b> <b>barley.</b> For wild-oat radical growth and coleoptile growth were more depressed than germination, though. The allelopathic potential <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> plant parts was not stable over its life cycle for wild-oat. Leaves and stems were the most phytotoxic barley plant parts for wild-oat in the all stages. Among the varieties Eizeh appeared as the best one showing toxicity to seed germination of wild oat at its stage 4 and 8. Results suggested that the response by wild-oat varied depending on the source of allelochemicals (plant part) and the growth stage <b>of</b> the <b>barley</b> plant and kind of variety. The results leaded to conclude that Eizeh variety <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> was good to grow as it has good check on seed germination of wild oat plants {{as well as it}} also retarded the growth of root and shoot length of oat...|$|R
40|$|Mature barley lectin is a dimeric protein {{composed}} of two identical 18 -kilodalton polypeptides. The subunits <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> lectin are initially synthesized as glycosylated proproteins, which are post-translationally processed to the mature protein preceding or concomitant with deposition <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> lectin in vacuoles. To investigate the functional role of the glycan in processing and intracellular transport <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> lectin to vacuoles, the sole N-linked glycosylation site residing within the COOH-terminal propeptide <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> lectin was altered by site-directed mutagenesis. cDNA clones encoding wild-type (wt) or glycosylation-minus (gly-) barley lectin preproproteins were placed under the transcriptional control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter and introduced into Nicotiana tabacum cv Wisconsin 38. Barley lectin synthesized from both the wt and gly- constructs was processed and correctly targeted to vacuoles of tobacco leaves. Localization <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> lectin in vacuoles processed from the nonglycosylated gly- proprotein indicated that the high-mannose glycan <b>of</b> the <b>barley</b> lectin proprotein was not essential for targeting barley lectin to vacuoles. However, pulse-chase labeling experiments demonstrated that the glycosylated wt proprotein and the nonglycosylated gly- proprotein were differentially processed to the mature protein and transported from the Golgi complex at different rates. These results implicate an indirect functional role for the glycan in post-translational processing and transport <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> lectin to vacuoles...|$|R

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was performed to}} investigate the possibility of barley-bitter vetch intercropping under field conditions, based on factorial using randomized complete blocks design with three replications, at the Agricultural Research Station of Bu-Ali Sina University, Hamadan, Iran. Treatments were sole cropping <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> (200, 300 and 400 plants/m 2 densities), sole cropping of bitter vetch (20, 40 and 60 plants/m 2 densities) and additive intercropping based on {{combination of the two}} species. Results revealed that the effects of treatments were significant for number of seeds per spike, flag leaf chlorophyll, grain yield and biological yield <b>of</b> <b>barley.</b> Interaction <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> density× bitter vetch density significantly affected only grain and biological yields <b>of</b> <b>barley.</b> Maximum number <b>of</b> seeds/spike (22. 25) and leaf chlorophyll (43. 38 SPAD) was achieved at 200 and 400 barley plants/m 2, respectively. Also, maximum plant height (43. ‌ 8 cm) and number <b>of</b> seeds/spike <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> (22. 78) and minimum value of these traits (32. 9 cm and 17. 22 seeds/spike, respectively) was observed in barley sole-cropping and intercropping (adding of 60 bitter vetch seeds/m 2 to barley densities), respectively. Sole cropping <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> at 400 plants/m 2 density produced the highest grain and biological yield (288 g/m 2 and 564 g/m 2, respectively) which was not significantly different from 300 plants/m 2 treatment (260 g/m 2 and 555 g/m 2, respectively). Plant height, number of pods/plant and leaf chlorophyll of bitter vetch were significantly affected by barley densities. Maximum plant height (20 cm) and leaf chlorophyll (46. 83 SPAD) were observed at adding <b>of</b> 400 <b>barley</b> plants/m 2 to bitter vetch densities. Maximum number of pods/plant (9. 22) was in sole cropping of bitter vetch. Also, comparison of bitter vetch densities revealed that 60 plants/m 2 was superior to 20 and 40 plants/m 2 densities. Maximum land equivalent ratio (LER= 1. 81) and system productivity index (SPI= 4526) were achieved at intercropping <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> and bitter vetch with densities of 300 and 20 plants/m 2, respectively. Therefore, it seems that intercropping of low density of bitter vetch (20 plants/m 2) with normal density <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> (300 plants/m 2) may give better overall yield and income than sole cropping <b>of</b> <b>barley...</b>|$|R
