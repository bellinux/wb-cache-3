5|$|Forms of {{traditional}} football have been played throughout Europe and beyond since antiquity. Many of these involved {{handling of the}} ball, and scrummage-like formations. These archaic forms of football, typically classified as mob football, would be played between neighboring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams, who would clash in a heaving <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> struggling to drag an inflated pig's bladder by any means possible to markers {{at each end of}} a town. By some accounts, in some such events any means could be used to move the ball towards the goal, as long as it did not lead to manslaughter or murder. These antiquated games went into sharp decline in the 19th century when the Highway Act 1835 was passed banning the playing of football on public highways.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Aya {{sees the}} orange <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> {{from the park}} enter the city water supply. She goes to Dr. Klamp one more time, and discovers that Dr. Klamp has {{engineered}} special sperm for Eve {{so that she can}} create the Ultimate Being. He then spontaneously combusts. Aya finds Eve {{in another part of the}} museum, where the orange mass has surrounded her, forming an impermeable shield to protect her while the Ultimate Being gestates within her. After several failed attempts to attack Eve, the military asks Aya to attack her from a chopper, as she is the only one who can get close without combusting. The plan works, but Aya has to personally finish the fight on a now-wrecked Statue of Liberty, where Eve finally succumbs to necrosis due to her unstable cells. As Aya rests on a naval vessel, the Ultimate Being is born and attacks the surrounding ships. Aya does battle with the Ultimate Being, but its mitochondria causes it to evolve at an alarming rate. Aya sets the vessel's boiler pressure dangerously high, so as to destroy it with the Ultimate Being on board.|$|E

Except for a short segment of the vestibule, the building had mainly collapsed into the cellar and burned until the wood was consumed.

These were mainly from the gallery and the stairway, which, in the original structure, had been above the vestibule ceiling against the south wall of the building.|$|E

25|$|Heavy snow {{damaged the}} Jingguang railway from Beijing to Guangzhou. Tens of {{thousands}} of people (on occasion as many as 500,000 to 800,000 at once) were left stranded at several railway stations across southern China, including Guangzhou railway station. It was estimated that nearly 6million railway passengers in total were stranded during the period while about 8,000 cargo trains were delayed. Backlogs at that station where masses of people were waiting desperately to return home lasted several days. Many of the travellers took refuge in an emergency shelter at the China Import and Export Fair exhibition center where at times the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> was about the size of three to four entire football fields. Goods were distributed to stranded travellers including free water bottles and lunch boxes of rice, chicken legs and cabbage that were sold at about a dollar each.|$|E

500|$|Kurosawa {{employed}} {{a number of}} recurring major themes in his films. These include: (a) the master-disciple relationship between a usually older mentor and one or more novices, which often involves spiritual as well as technical mastery and self-mastery; (b) the heroic champion, the exceptional individual who emerges from the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> to produce something or right some injustice; (c) the depiction of extremes of weather as both dramatic devices and symbols of human passion; and (d) the recurrence of cycles of inexorable savage violence within history. According to Stephen Prince, the latter theme began with Throne of Blood (1957), and recurred in Kurosawa films of the 1980s. Mr. Prince calls this theme [...] "the countertradition to the committed, heroic mode of Kurosawa's cinema." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{about one}} {{o'clock in the}} {{afternoon}} of 6 October 1789, the vast throng escorted the royal family and a complement of one hundred deputies back to the capital, this time with the armed National Guards leading the way. By now the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> had grown to over sixty thousand, and the return trip took about nine hours. The procession could seem merry at times, as guardsmen hoisted up loaves of bread stuck on the tips of their bayonets, and some of the market women rode gleefully astride the captured cannon. Yet, even as the crowd sang pleasantries about their [...] "Good Papa", their violent mentality could not be misread; celebratory gunshots flew over the royal carriage and some marchers even carried pikes bearing the heads of the slaughtered Versailles guards. A sense of victory over the ancien régime was imbued in the parade, and it was understood by all that the king was now fully at the service of the people.|$|E
500|$|Forgoing {{the closure}} favored by its contemporaries, Changelings final {{sequence}} reflects Collins' renewed hope that Walter is alive. The shot is a {{two and a}} half minute sequence showing Collins' walking off to become lost in a crowd. The sequence is representative of the range of effects that feature throughout the film; Los Angeles is presented as major character, brought to life by unobtrusive peripheral imagery that allows the viewer to focus on the story and the emotional cues. The [...] "hustle and bustle" [...] of the sequence was required to convey that downtown Los Angeles in 1935 was a congested urban center. In the closing shot, the camera tilts up to reveal miles of city blocks, pedestrians on the streets, cars going by and streetcars running along their tracks. The version of the film that screened at Cannes did not include this sequence; the scene faded to black as Collins walked away. The new 4,000-frame shot was Owens' idea. He felt the abrupt cut to black pulled the viewer out of the film too quickly, and that it left no room for emotional reflection. Owens said, [...] "There is a legend at the end before the credits. The legend speaks to what happened after the fact, and I think you need to just swallow that for a few moments with the visual still with you." [...] Owens told Eastwood the film should end like Chinatown(1974), in which the camera lifts to take in the scene: [...] "The camera booms up and she walks away from us from a very emotional, poignant scene at the end, walks away into this <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> and traffic. It's very hopeful and sad at the same time." ...|$|E

[...] Unlike García Lorca in Poeta en Nueva York or countless other poets, the city is not inhuman, cold, abstract. [...] The emphasis is on the mass of humanity it holds. The city is a mix of good and evil, man’s heroic endeavours and barbarity – a reality that has to be embraced in totality even when you cannot understand it. The poet is both an isolated individual in a hotel room and a member of this society.|$|E
