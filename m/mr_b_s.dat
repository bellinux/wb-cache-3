The reaction occurs within three months of instituting gold therapy, is characterised by profuse diarrhoea and vomiting with abdominal pain, fever, and sometimes eosinophilia. Petechial changes are prominent on endoscopy and the endoscopic and histological features of the gut lesion do not resemble inflammatory bowel disease. The overall mortality is 26 % but has decreased in recent years. There is no specific therapy but in severe cases diversional surgery may be justified. Case history <b>Mrs</b> <b>B</b> <b>S</b> was a 34 year old patient of Asian extraction {{who had lived in}} the UK for 29 years and was admitted with a three week history of diarrhoea. In 1980 she presented with symptoms typical of rheumatoid arthritis confirmed on serology. Treat-ment included a number of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications and choloroquine. In the summer of 1982, because of symptom deterioration, a decision was made to treat her with intramuscular sodium aurothiomalate. Twenty four hours after an initial dose of 10 mg she developed pruritis, sore eyes, a rash on the neck, and a sore throat. These symptoms settled after a few days and one week later she received a second dose of 10 mg, with no problems. A third dose of 50 mg was given after a further week and the following day she developed a fever, sore throat, vomiting, and diarrhoea. The diarrhoea progressively deteriorated over the next three weeks although her arthritis improved. On admission she was dehydrated, shocked, had a temperature of 38 °C and a pulse of 120. The serum potassium was low and there was a mild eosinophilia (800 /cu mm).
