5|$|Marrella was {{the first}} Burgess Shale fossil that Whittington re-examined, and gave the first {{indication}} that surprises were on the way. Although clearly an arthropod that walked on the sea-floor, Marella {{was very different from}} the known marine arthropod groups (trilobites, crustaceans and chelicerates) in the structure of its legs and gills, and above all in the number and positions of the appendages on its head, which are the main feature used to classify arthropods. A fossil of Marrella from the Burgess Shale has also provided the earliest clear evidence of <b>molting.</b>|$|E
5|$|The cockroach's {{ability to}} {{withstand}} radiation better than {{human beings can}} be explained through the cell cycle. Cells are most vulnerable {{to the effects of}} radiation when they are dividing. A cockroach's cells divide only once each time it molts, which is weekly at most in a juvenile roach. Since not all cockroaches would be <b>molting</b> at the same time, many would be unaffected by an acute burst of radiation, but lingering radioactive fallout would still be harmful.|$|E
40|$|Surveys of gray seals (Halichoerus grypus) {{during the}} <b>molt</b> period, {{when they are}} {{abundant}} on land, {{can be used to}} monitor changes in population size, but accurate interpretation of results requires an understanding of the <b>molt</b> process and how it may vary between years. This study investigates variability in onset (start date) and duration of visible <b>molt</b> by gray seals in the Wadden Sea, and the influence of environmental conditions on the onset. <b>Molt</b> was monitored in nine captive seals and observed <b>molt</b> phases were applied to wild seals over seven annual <b>molt</b> periods between 2004 and 2010, monitored using aerial photography. The onset of visible <b>molt</b> varied significantly between years, for example it differed 28 d between 2008 and 2009. Model selection by AIC retained one environmental variable that correlated with <b>molt</b> onset; however, its effect was inconsistent within the <b>molt</b> season and did not explain some of the apparent observed annual variation.

40|$|In birds, <b>molt</b> {{duration}} is {{an important}} parameter that can affect plumage functionality and consequently the fitness of individuals. However, our knowledge about the factors affecting variation in <b>molt</b> speed is scarce, mostly because of the methodological difficulties of studying avian <b>molt.</b> In this study, we used a ptilochronology-based approach to estimate the growth rate at which tail feathers were produced during <b>molt,</b> and hence {{to shed light on}} the relationship between <b>molt</b> duration and feather growth rate. For that purpose, we used three different datasets. Firstly, we tested whether the average <b>molt</b> duration of 22 passerine species was correlated with the mean growth rate of their feathers using both conventional and phylogenetically-corrected statistical procedures. Secondly, we explored this same association between captive Great Tits Parus major. And thirdly, we took advantage of the biannual complete <b>molt</b> performed by Willow Warblers Phylloscopus trochilus to examine if the feathers synthesized during their short summer <b>molt</b> grew faster than those produced during their long winter <b>molt.</b> Feather growth rates were negatively correlated with <b>molt</b> duration in all analyses, revealing that <b>molt</b> duration can be estimated from the growth rate of a single feather. However, predictive power was limited by the fact that <b>molt</b> duration is mainly modulated by <b>molt</b> intensity, which seems to be correlated with ecological constraints in our interspecific approach. We also discuss the implications of our results for the evolution of <b>molt</b> duration, and the potential application of ptilochronology in its study. ...|$|R

5|$|Although {{reproduction}} occurs {{around the}} year, {{there is a}} peak during the summer (November to April). <b>Molting</b> mostly occurs during autumn and winter (April to August). At one locality in Mendoza, Akodon spegazzinii occurs at an estimated density of 21 individuals per hectare (8.5 per acre) and has a home range size of about 300 m2 (3200sqft). A number of sigmodontines have been recorded as occurring with A.spegazzinii, including A.caenosus, A.simulator, Neotomys ebriosus, Abrothrix illuteus, Reithrodon auritus, Andinomys edax, and various species of Eligmodontia, Necromys, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Oxymycterus, and Phyllotis.

5|$|Birds need {{to alter}} their {{metabolism}} {{to meet the demands}} of migration. The storage of energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations. In addition, the feathers of a bird suffer from wear-and-tear and require to be moulted. The timing of this moult – usually once a year but sometimes twice – varies with some species moulting prior to moving to their winter grounds and others <b>molting</b> prior to returning to their breeding grounds. Apart from physiological adaptations, migration sometimes requires behavioural changes such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation.|$|E
5|$|Hemimetabolous insects, {{those with}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing {{a series of}} molts. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The <b>molting</b> process begins as the insect's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside the old one. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. When this stage is complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest.|$|E

5|$|Larval ticks hatch {{with six}} legs, {{acquiring}} {{the other two}} after a blood meal and <b>molting</b> into the nymph stage. In the nymphal and adult stages, ticks have eight legs, {{each of which has}} seven segments and is tipped with a pair of claws. The legs are sometimes ornamented and usually bear sensory or tactile hairs. In addition to being used for locomotion, the tarsus of leg I contains a unique sensory structure, Haller's organ, which can detect odors and chemicals emanating from the host, as well as sensing changes in temperature and air currents. When not being used for walking, the legs remain tightly folded against the body.|$|E
5|$|As in {{closely related}} insect {{groups in the}} {{superorder}} Dictyoptera, mantises go through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult (mantises are among the hemimetabolous insects). For smaller species, the eggs may hatch in 3–4 weeks as opposed to 4–6 weeks for larger species. The nymphs may be colored differently from the adult, and the early stages are often mimics of ants. A mantis nymph grows bigger as it molts its exoskeleton. <b>Molting</b> can happen five to 10 times before the adult stage is reached, depending on the species. After the final molt, most species have wings, though some species remain wingless or brachypterous ("short-winged"), particularly in the female sex. The lifespan of a mantis depends on the species; smaller ones may live 4–8 weeks, while larger species may live 4–6 months.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammal {{adaptation}} to an aquatic lifestyle varies considerably between species. Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers. Seals and sea-lions are semiaquatic; they spend {{the majority of}} their time in the water, but need to return to land for important activities such as mating, breeding and <b>molting.</b> In contrast, both otters and the polar bear are much less adapted to aquatic living. Their diet varies considerably as well; some may eat zooplankton, others may eat fish, squid, shellfish, sea-grass and a few may eat other mammals. While the number of marine mammals is small compared to those found on land, their roles in various ecosystems are large, especially concerning the maintenance of marine ecosystems, through processes including the regulation of prey populations. This role in maintaining ecosystems makes them of particular concern as 23% of marine mammal species are currently threatened.|$|E

40|$|The <b>molt</b> cycle {{influences}} a lobster’s {{life cycle}} in many ways, because a lobster is either preparing for ecdysis or recovering from it. There {{has been done}} a lot of research regarding this subject on the Homarid lobster, in order to understand and improve conservation. The <b>molt</b> cycle is divided in 5 major stages and several sub stages, which are used in this thesis and are adapted for Homarus americanus. The Homarid lobster undergoes a metamorphosis in the <b>molt</b> from the third to the fourth stage, it is now possible for the homarid lobster to settle on the ocean floor. For {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms for <b>molt,</b> hormonal control has been intensively studied. The opinions differ and change due to new research. The mechanisms that cause <b>molt</b> and the internal changes ensure alterations in the homarid lobster’s behavior. Observations have shown that alteration in aggression and the escape response occur over the <b>molt</b> cycle. Behavioral changes are seen in the mating act as well during the <b>molt</b> cycle. Females are affected by <b>molt,</b> because receptivity peaks after ecdysis and fertilization is most likely to occur during this time. More recent studies have shown that females or not that reliant on their stage in the <b>molt</b> cycle as was once thought. Sperm can be stored and batches of eggs can be fertilized in multiple years. Male homarid lobster’s are affect by <b>molt</b> during the mating season through their dominance status. A dominant male loses his status when he <b>molt,</b> but this is regained several days afterwards. It is therefore not smart for a male to <b>molt</b> during the mating season, because females prefer dominant males. ...|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} marine mammals, the sea otter has no blubber and relies on its {{exceptionally}} thick fur to keep warm. With up to 150,000 {{strands of hair}} per square centimeter (nearly one million per sqin), its fur is the densest of any animal. The fur consists of long, waterproof guard hairs and short underfur; the guard hairs keep the dense underfur layer dry. Cold water is kept completely away from the skin and heat loss is limited. The fur is thick year-round, as it is shed and replaced gradually {{rather than in a}} distinct <b>molting</b> season. As the ability of the guard hairs to repel water depends on utmost cleanliness, the sea otter has the ability to reach and groom the fur on any part of its body, taking advantage of its loose skin and an unusually supple skeleton. The coloration of the pelage is usually deep brown with silver-gray speckles, but it can range from yellowish or grayish brown to almost black. In adults, the head, throat, and chest are lighter in color {{than the rest of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Female {{cockroaches}} {{are sometimes}} seen carrying egg cases {{on the end}} of their abdomens; the German cockroach holds about 30 to 40 long, thin eggs in a case called an ootheca. She drops the capsule prior to hatching, though live births do occur in rare instances. The egg capsule may take more than five hours to lay and is initially bright white in color. The eggs are hatched from the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air. The hatchlings are initially bright white nymphs and continue inflating themselves with air, becoming harder and darker within about four hours. Their transient white stage while hatching and later while <b>molting</b> has led to claims of albino cockroaches. Development from eggs to adults takes three to four months. Cockroaches live up to a year, and the female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime; in favorable conditions, she can produce 300 to 400 offspring. Other species of cockroaches, however, can produce far more eggs; in some cases a female needs to be impregnated only once to be able to lay eggs {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
25|$|Blue crabs grow by {{shedding}} their exoskeleton, or <b>molting,</b> {{to expose}} a new, larger exoskeleton. After it hardens, the new shell fills with body tissue. Shell hardening occurs most quickly in low salinity water where high osmotic pressure allows the shell to become rigid soon after <b>molting.</b> <b>Molting</b> reflects only incremental growth, making age estimation difficult. For blue crabs, {{the number of}} molts in a lifetime is fixed at approximately 25. Females typically exhibit 18 molts after the larval stages, while postlarval males molt about 20 times. Male blue crabs tend to grow broader and have more accentuated lateral spines than females. Growth and <b>molting</b> are profoundly influenced by temperature and food availability. Higher temperatures and greater food resources decrease {{the period of time}} between molts as well as the change in size during molts (molt increment). Salinity and disease also have subtle impacts on <b>molting</b> and growth rate. <b>Molting</b> occurs more rapidly in low salinity environments. The high osmotic pressure gradient causes water to quickly diffuse into a soft, recently molted blue crab's shell, allowing it to harden more quickly. The effects of diseases and parasites on growth and <b>molting</b> are less well understood, but in many cases have been observed to reduce growth between molts. For example, mature female blue crabs infected with the parasitic rhizocephalan barnacle Loxothylacus texanus appear extremely stunted in growth when compared to uninfected mature females. Blue crab may reach maturity within one year of hatching in the Gulf of Mexico, while Chesapeake Bay crabs may take up to 18 months to mature. As a result of different growth rates, commercial and recreational crabbing occur year-round in the Gulf of Mexico, while crabbing seasons are closed for colder parts of the year in northern states.|$|E

We documented {{patterns of}} feather <b>molt</b> in nonmigratory whooping cranes in Florida during 1993 - 2005. All birds replaced flight feathers (remiges) in a synchronous (simultaneous) manner and spent time flightless. It took 38 - 46 days (mean = 44 days, n = 8) for feathers to regrow and birds to regain flight ability. When flightless due to remigial <b>molt,</b> cranes became more secretive and spent more time in wetlands during feather regrowth. Most (70 %) whooping cranes first <b>molted</b> their remiges at 3 years of age, 20 % at 2 years of age, and 10 % at 4 years of age. Birds never <b>molted</b> their flight feathers in consecutive years; instead they usually skipped 1 or 2 years between <b>molts.</b> Sets of flight feathers lasted 2 - 4 years (mean 2. 5 years, n = 41).

40|$|Postbreeding {{ecology of}} the redhead duck (Aythya americana) was studied on Lake Winnipegosis from 1974 - 1977. Daily energy expenditure, {{including}} energy for activities and <b>molt,</b> showed little seasonal variation. Expenditures for <b>molt</b> were reduced by temporally staggering <b>molt</b> in different feather tracts. Redheads conserved energy through behavioral adaptations and by compensating higher demands with reduced expenditure elsewhere. Plant material comprised 92 and 98 % of the dry aggregate weight of food consumed by males and females. Drought in 1977 influenced distribution of redheads through its' effect on submergent vegetation. Body <b>molt</b> of pennaceous feathers in tracts II, III, and IV exhibited a bimodal pattern indicative of basic and alternate feather generations in males. Tracts I and VI <b>molted</b> irregularly, and tract V <b>molted</b> once coinciding with the single down <b>molt.</b> Prebasic <b>molt</b> was advanced in most tracts with the earlier termination of breeding during drought, whereas the prealternate <b>molt</b> was unaffected. Little annual variation in timing of wing <b>molt</b> in males occurred, suggesting that this <b>molt</b> was under photoperiodic control. Upper-wing coverts were <b>molted</b> gradually to provide protection to the exposed wing. Digestive organ size in males fluctuated seasonally in response to diet quality, quantity, and innately with predictable events. Changes in the gastro-intestinal tract {{at the beginning of}} <b>molt</b> were related to enhanced protein uptake. The concept of a labile protein reserve was applicable to seasonal variability in the size of proteinaceous tissues. Greater food intake correlated with higher tissue weights, whereas lower intake and increased protein demand caused a reduction in tissues. Skeletal muscles contributed most to the reserve. Reserves were drawn on throughout the flightless period to meet protein requirements. Lipids were stored in the abdominal cavity, on mesenteries of the small intestine, and in the subcutaneous depot, which was also the largest. Total fat content in males was lowest during breeding and averaged 8 to 9 % of body weight at the onset of wing <b>molt.</b> Total fat varied inversely with body water content, and independently of fat-free carcass weight. Foraging time explained 81 % of the variation in seasonal lipid levels...|$|R

40|$|Commercial {{laying hens}} are {{typically}} induced to <b>molt</b> {{in an effort}} to cease egg production and extend their productive life for a second egg laying cycle. Furthermore, egg quality is improved and egg production is higher post-molt compared to pre-molt levels. This practice has been traditionally induced by a period of feed withdrawal ranging from 4 to 14 days accompanied by light restriction. However, there has been recent concern about the feed withdrawal method and its effects on laying hen well-being. Therefore, alternative methods have been examined. Low-energy <b>molt</b> diets are currently the most common method for inducing <b>molt</b> in laying hens, but they are not as effective at decreasing egg production during <b>molt</b> as feed withdrawal. For these reasons, we examined a 1 -wk calcium pre-molt treatment that was followed 2 low-energy <b>molt</b> diets (soybean hulls and wheat middlings) compared to a 7 d feed withdrawal. During the calcium pre-molt treatment, hens were fed either a combination of fine (0. 14 mm mean diameter) and coarse (2. 27 mm mean diameter) CaCO 3 or all-fine CaCO 3, such that only the particle size of the calcium provided in the diets differed between the 2 treatments. When calcium is given to the hen in a fine particle size, it is more readily solubilized in the digestive tract and then hen may be deficient in calcium at night when it is needed for eggshell formation. Therefore, our hypothesis was that the fine-calcium pre-molt treatment would result in a more efficient <b>molt</b> compared to the traditional coarse-calcium treatment. The objectives of our study were to evaluate the effects of the calcium pre-molt treatment and low-energy <b>molt</b> diets or feed withdrawal on the behavior, production, and physiology of laying hens. We used a total of 981 Hy-Line W- 36 laying hens (85 wk of age) that were housed 3 per cage with a 16 h photoperiod. During the calcium pre-molt treatment, hens had free access to feed and a 24 h photoperiod. During the 4 wk <b>molt</b> period, hens fed the low-energy diets had free access to feed, whereas the hens assigned to the feed withdrawal treatment had no feed for 7 d followed by restricted skip-a-day feeding (60 g/hen per feeding day). During the first 3 wk of <b>molt</b> the hens had an 8 h photoperiod and this was increased during the last week of <b>molt</b> to 12 h. Behavior was recorded for 4 h a day once during the baseline period, twice during <b>molt,</b> and twice post-molt for 2 postures (sitting and active) and 5 behaviors (feeding, drinking, non-nutritive pecking, preening, and aggression). Stress in the laying hens was assessed by a heterophil to lymphocyte ratio. Production data included egg production and related measures, feed consumption, body weight, and egg quality measures. Physiology data included measures of bone metabolism including bone-ash percentage and concentrations of plasma minerals, as well as fresh weights of the reproductive tract. Behavioral data was assessed using the PROC MIXED procedure of SAS, whereas the production and physiology data was assessed using ANOVA with JMP. A P-value ≤ 0. 05 was considered significant in all comparisons. The calcium pre-molt treatment had no carryover effects on behaviors and postures of the laying hens during or post-molt. During <b>molt,</b> the hens assigned to the feed withdrawal treatment spent less time eating and drinking and more time being active compared to the hens fed the other 2 <b>molt</b> diets. However, there were no differences among the hens during the post-molt period for these behaviors. There were no differences in aggression, non-nutritive pecking, or preening. Overall, hens spent more time in non-nutritive pecking behavior during <b>molt</b> compared to post-molt. The treatments had no effect on the heterophil to lymphocyte ratios and they did not increase compared to baseline values. Comparing the production data, the fine-calcium pre-molt treatment was more efficient at inducing <b>molt</b> compared to the coarse-calcium pre-molt treatment by lowering egg production during <b>molt</b> and increasing egg production post-molt. This fine-calcium pre-molt treatment was successful regardless of which <b>molt</b> diet was fed. The feed withdrawal <b>molt</b> diet was the most efficient at decreasing egg production during <b>molt.</b> Between the 2 low-energy <b>molt</b> diets, the soybean hulls were more effective at inducing <b>molt</b> compared to the wheat middlings <b>molt</b> diet by decreasing egg production and reproductive tract weights during <b>molt.</b> There were no differences among the treatments in egg quality, however, these measures did increase post-molt compared to baseline levels. Additionally, any changes in bone metabolism measures during the <b>molt</b> period returned to baseline levels during the post-molt period, suggesting effects of <b>molt</b> are temporary. In conclusion, the treatments did not adversely affect the behaviors or postures of laying hens. The fine-calcium pre-molt treatment was effective at inducing a more efficient <b>molt</b> when used in combination with a low-energy <b>molt</b> diet or feed withdrawal. The low-energy <b>molt</b> diets, specifically the soybean hulls, were effective at inducing <b>molt</b> and can therefore be considered as alternatives to feed withdrawal for inducing <b>molt...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Many animals display {{colorful}} {{signals in}} their integument which convey {{information about the}} quality of their bearer. Theoretically, these ornaments incur differential production and/or maintenance costs that enforce their honesty. However, the proximate mechanisms of production costs are poorly understood and contentious in cases of non-carotenoid-based plumage ornaments like the melanin-based badge and depigmented white wing-bar in house sparrows Passer domesticus. Costly life-history events are adaptively separated in time, thus, when reproduction is extended, the time available for <b>molt</b> is curtailed and, in turn, <b>molt</b> rate is accelerated. Methodology/Principal Findings: We experimentally accelerated the <b>molt</b> rate by shortening the photoperiod in order to test whether this environmental constraint is mirrored in the expression of plumage ornaments. Sparrows which had undergone an accelerated <b>molt</b> developed smaller badges and less bright wing-bars compared to conspecifics that <b>molted</b> at a natural rate being held at natural-like photoperiod. There was no difference in the brightness of the badge or the size of the wing-bar. Conclusions/Significance: These results indicate that the time available for <b>molt</b> and thus the rate at which <b>molt</b> occurs may constrain the expression of melanin-based and depigmented plumage advertisements. This mechanism may lead to the evolution of honest signaling if the onset of <b>molt</b> is condition-dependent through the timing of and/or trade-off between breeding and <b>molt...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of male ornamentation {{has long been}} the focus of sexual selection studies. However, evidence is accumulating that sexually selected traits can also be lost, although the process is ill-understood. In male fairy-wrens (Malurus spp.), early <b>molt</b> into the seasonal breeding plumage is critical for obtaining extra-pair paternity (EPP), which reaches very high levels in these socially monogamous songbirds. A notable exception is the purple-crowned fairy-wren, Malurus coronatus, which, like its congeners, breeds cooperatively, but where EPP is very rare. Nevertheless, males develop a conspicuous seasonal breeding plumage at highly variable times. Based on 6 years of <b>molt</b> data collected for 137 individuals, we investigated the adaptive significance of pre-breeding <b>molt</b> timing as a sexual signal under (near) genetic monogamy. <b>Molt</b> timing varied between and within individuals with age and climate: <b>molt</b> was completed earlier in older males and after wetter years. Despite its potential to act as a sexual signal of male quality, fitness benefits and costs of early <b>molt</b> appear limited: <b>molt</b> timing did not correlate with 1) the likelihood of gaining a breeding position; 2) female mate preference (EPP/cuckoldry, divorce); 3) female reproductive investment (breeding timing, clutch size, number of clutches); 4) breeding performance (hatching success, fledging success, fledgling survival, annual reproductive success); and 5) male survival. However, although <b>molt</b> timing did not predict which subordinates would become breeders, breeders <b>molted</b> earlier than subordinates.

Laying hens were housed 3 per cage (30. 5 cm wide × 40. 6 cm deep × 44. 5 cm high), providing 413 cm 2 per hen. Six treatments were compared in a 2 × 3 factorial design with 2 Ca (coarse and fine) pre-molt treatments and 3 <b>molt</b> diets: feed withdrawal (FW), soybean hulls (SH), and wheat middlings (WM). The Ca pre-molt treatment was defined as the period when the hens received either a combination of fine (0. 14 mm in diameter) and coarse (2. 27 mm in diameter) CaCO 3 or an all-fine CaCO 3 mixed into a commercial diet for 1 wk. Both diets were formulated to contain 4. 6 % Ca, such that only the particle size of the CaCO 3 differed between the 2 treatments. Hens had free access to feed and water and had a 24 -h photoperiod. The 3 <b>molt</b> diets were applied (FW, SH, or WM) for a total of 28 d. The hens assigned to the FW diet were deprived of feed for 7 d with free access to water followed by 21 d of skip-a-day feeding restricted to 60 g of feed/hen per feeding day. The hens fed the WM and SH <b>molt</b> diets were given free access to feed and water during the entire 28 d <b>molt</b> period. Lighting was reduced to 8 h for the first 3 wk and was then increased to 12 h {{at the start of the}} last week of <b>molt.</b> Behavior was recorded by camera once before <b>molt,</b> twice during <b>molt,</b> and twice post-molt for 2 h in the morning and 2 h at night. The acquisition of 2 postures and 5 behaviors were obtained by 2 experienced observers who viewed the recordings using 24 h mode onto the Observer software using a 1 min scan sampling technique. Postures and behaviors were not different among treatments during the baseline period. The Ca pre-molt treatment had no carryover effect during or post-molt. The hens assigned to the FW <b>molt</b> diet spent more time in active postures and feeding and drinking behaviors during <b>molt</b> compared to hens fed the other 2 <b>molt</b> diets. Post-molt, all hens, regardless of <b>molt</b> diet, spent the same amount of time in each of these behaviors. The hens assigned to the FW <b>molt</b> diet spent more time preening during <b>molt</b> compared to post-molt, whereas the hens fed the WM and SH <b>molt</b> diets did not differ between the 2 periods (Table 1). In conclusion, these low-energy <b>molt</b> diets did not adversely affect the postures and behaviors of the laying hen and are therefore acceptable dietary alternatives to FW for inducing <b>molt...</b>|$|R
