The Ancient Egyptians were the first to use lead minerals in cosmetics, an application that spread to Ancient Greece and beyond; the Egyptians may have used lead for sinkers in fishing nets, glazes, glasses, enamels, and for ornaments. Various civilizations of the Fertile Crescent used lead as a writing material, as currency, and for construction. Lead was used in the Ancient Chinese royal court as a stimulant, as currency, and as a contraceptive; the Indus Valley civilization and the Mesoamericans used it for making amulets; and the eastern and southern African peoples used lead in wire drawing.|$|E

5|$|Smelting, {{which is}} an {{essential}} part of the primary production, is often skipped during secondary production. It is only performed when <b>metallic</b> <b>lead</b> had undergone significant oxidation. The process is similar to that of primary production in either a blast furnace or a rotary furnace, with the essential difference being the greater variability of yields. The Isasmelt process is a more recent method that may act as an extension to primary production; battery paste from spent lead–acid batteries has sulfur removed by treating it with alkali, and is then treated in a coal-fueled furnace in the presence of oxygen, which yields impure lead, with antimony the most common impurity. Refining of secondary lead is similar to that of primary lead; some refining processes may be skipped depending on the material recycled and its potential contamination, with bismuth and silver most commonly being accepted as impurities.|$|E
5|$|The lead analog of the {{simplest}} organic compound, methane, is plumbane. Plumbane may be obtained in a reaction between <b>metallic</b> <b>lead</b> and atomic hydrogen. Two simple derivatives, tetramethyllead and tetraethyllead, are the best-known organolead compounds. These compounds are relatively stable: tetraethyllead only starts to decompose if heated or if exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet light. (Tetraphenyllead is even more thermally stable, decomposing at 270°C.) With sodium metal, lead readily forms an equimolar alloy that reacts with alkyl halides to form organometallic compounds such as tetraethyllead. The oxidizing nature of many organolead compounds is usefully exploited: lead tetraacetate is an important laboratory reagent for oxidation in organic chemistry and tetraethyllead was once produced in larger quantities than any other organometallic compound. Other organolead compounds are less chemically stable. For many organic compounds, a lead analog does not exist.|$|E

In contrast to previous DMFT work on multilayered systems, which was mainly {{based on the}} single-site approximation, we investigate the role of interplanar Coulomb correlations by using cellular DMFT. Accordingly, the self-energy matrix exhibits off-diagonal components in the layer index. As a model system we consider the single-band Hubbard model in a thin film geometry. The films can be either free standing or sandwiched between semi-infinite <b>metallic</b> <b>leads.</b> For isolated thin films, it is shown that the metal-insulator phase transition occurs either via a conventional mechanism, with a diverging imaginary part of the local self-energy, or via another one involving a discontinuous change of the real part of the off-diagonal self-energy. When the film is connected to <b>metallic</b> <b>leads,</b> the former phase transition disappears due to the normal-metal proximity effects, whereas the latter survives and significantly influences the electronic properties of the thin film. The leakage of metallic states into the Mott gap of the correlated film is greatly reduced compared to single-site DMFT calculations...|$|R

The main aspects related to the interplay between the half-filling Kondo effect and the antiferromagnetic correlation between the quantum dots are reviewed. Slave boson results for conductance, local density of states in the quantum dots, and the renormalized energy parameters, are presented. As a different approach to the Kondo physics in a double dot system, the Kondo cloud extension inside the <b>metallic</b> <b>leads</b> is calculated and its dependence with the inter-dot coupling is analyzed. In addition, the cloud extension permits the calculation of the Kondo temperature of the double quantum dot.

In the weak tunneling regime, where Coulomb blockade dominates, the nanotubes act as onedimensional quantum dots.

For open contacts Coulomb blockade is completely suppressed, and the low-temperature conductance remains generally high, although we often see distinct dips in the conductance versus gate voltage which {{may result from}} resonant backscattering. Experiments on single-wall carbon nanotubes have allowed the exploration of numerous quantum transport phenomena {{for the first time}} in a molecular system. 1 Until recently these phenomena were limited to the Coulomb blockade regime owing to the relatively poor (lowtransmission) contacts achieved between the nanotubes and the <b>metallic</b> <b>leads.</b> 2, 3 However, devices with good (high-transmission, or ‘open’) contacts can now be fabricated 4, 5 by evaporating metals on top of nanotubes grown by either laser ablation or chemical vapor deposition.

The tube was then bent to an angle, at about half an inch distance from the closed end; and the part between the angle and the extremity being softened, was forced upward, as in the figure, so as to form a bridge, or rather separation, producing two little depressions or basins a, b, within the tube. This arrangement was suspended by a platina wire, as before, so that the heat of a spirit-lamp could be applied to it, such inclination being given to it as would allow all air to escape during the fusion of the chloride of lead. A positive electrode was then provided, by bending up the end of a platina wire into a knot, and fusing about twenty grains of <b>metallic</b> <b>lead</b> on to it, in a small closed tube of glass, which was afterwards broken away.
