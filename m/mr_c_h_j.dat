Postmus Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia. G. P. M. Mannes, W. G. Boersma, <b>C.</b> <b>H.</b> <b>J.</b> M. Baur, P. E. Postmus. ABSTRACT: We describe a patient, {{who had no}} pre-existing disease, with bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a rare complication. In spite {{of the use of}} antibiotics and intensive treatment the mortality rate of this kind of infection remains high. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequently found micro-organ-ism responsible for community-acquired pneumonia. In 25 - 35 % of these patients pneumococcal bacteraemia is found, with a 2 - 3 times higher mor· tality rate than that for non-bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia...|$|R
