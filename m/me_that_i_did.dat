I had already used the obvious word {{hypothesis}} {{in the sequence}} hypothesis, and in addition I wanted {{to suggest that this}} new assumption was more central and more powerful. ... As it turned out, {{the use of the word}} dogma caused almost more trouble than it was worth. Many years later Jacques Monod pointed out to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not appear to understand the correct use of the word dogma, which is a belief that cannot be doubted. I did apprehend this in a vague sort of way but since I thought that all religious beliefs were without foundation, I used the word the way I myself thought about it, not as most of the world does, and simply applied it to a grand hypothesis that, however plausible, had little direct experimental support." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 14, 2013, Kid Ink {{announced}} his first project released by RCA, a digital-only EP titled Almost Home, {{which it was}} released on May 28, 2013. The EP featured artists, such as French Montana, Wale, Meek Mill, ASAP Ferg and Rico Love, among others. Upon its release, the EP debuted at number 27 on the US Billboard 200 and it has sold 15,000 copies in its first week. It {{was supported by the}} single's [...] "Bad Ass" [...] and [...] "Money and the Power" [...] both will be included on the deluxe edition of My Own Lane. Ink spoke of the EP's sound compared to the album saying, [...] "The EP was a taste for the summer, the records were directed more toward the summer. I don’t want it to feel like the album is gonna sound exactly like that, but I do think certain records on there like [...] "Bossin’ Up" [...] and [...] "Money and the Power" [...] and [...] "Fuck Sleep," [...] which are records I feel like have such a strong sound and a brand new sound for <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> drag them over– not those specific records, but those vibes." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Even, in <b>that</b> case, father. <b>I</b> {{will marry}} none without your consent, and have so {{absolute}} a confidence in your tender care of <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not even hesitate to say, I will marry him to whom you contract me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Amyas! Heaven forgive <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} the bigness of you. Your brother, sir, died like a gentleman as he was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Mr. Kendal; 'I {{have been}} telling her that she is convincing <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> wrong in {{allowing}} her to burthen herself with this charge.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks; yes, I'm sure of it. When {{you hear}} my name {{mentioned}} after I am gone, I hope that they'll say of <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> my duty as President of the republic." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{filling it}} with other distractions, I suppose you mean," [...] I answered. [...] "A fickle-minded person you must think me. But it pleases me so much to have you take an {{interest}} in <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not resent any of your advice." ...|$|R
60|$|TO {{begin with}} let <b>me</b> admit <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it on purpose. Perhaps {{it was partly}} from jealousy.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I had two {{or three}} times, at or about my {{deliverance}} from this temptation, such strange apprehensions of the grace of God, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could hardly bear up under it, it was so out of measure amazing, when I thought it could reach <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> think, if <b>that</b> sense of it had abode long upon me, {{it would have made}} me incapable for business.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} she could have told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know before," [...] he said, {{obviously}} to himself, but perfectly audible. [...] "Because I always did know it," [...] he added louder, as if in despair.|$|E
60|$|This {{so pleased}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not try to}} resist, but allowed this simple-hearted {{stranger}} to throw his arms about me and weep a few tranquilizing tears {{down the back of}} my neck. Then he went his way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ducaine," [...] he said, [...] "forgive <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not come}} to your aid. I will see {{that you do not}} suffer later on. But what in Heaven's name is the meaning of this last abstraction' from the safe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he answered, [...] "I shall {{tell her}} tomorrow. Having reposed {{confidence}} in you, {{it would be}} treating her shamefully if <b>I</b> should withhold <b>that</b> confidence from her. She has often said to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not look a day older than when I married her. I want her now to know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> need never look a day older; I shall counterfeit old age no more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I say it {{in order}} to make you {{understand}} the exact truth. A woman cannot love a man because she feels for him even the most profound respect. She will often do so when there is neither respect nor esteem. My father has so spoken of you to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> esteem you; but that has no effect in touching my heart, therefore I cannot become your wife." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} new and strange in my blood. It came to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> indeed <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not want to kill.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{did you say}} of <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not deserve? For, {{though your}} accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my {{behaviour}} to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence." ...|$|E
60|$|Now I {{must buy}} my outfit {{and take the}} trail for Penetier. This I {{resolved}} to do with as few questions as possible. I never before was troubled by sensitiveness, but the fact had dawned upon <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not like being taken for a tenderfoot. So, with this in mind, I entered a general merchandise store.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have too}} sincere {{a respect for}} Lady Harry to answer you," [...] Mountjoy said. [...] "At the same time, let me {{acknowledge}} my obligations to your lordship. You have reminded <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a foolish thing when I called here without an invitation. I {{agree with you that}} the sooner my mistake is set right the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My father {{reminded}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was {{twenty-one years}} old, last birthday--and told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> as <b>I</b> liked. I understood him, and I left the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{the young}} lord. He is bright and clever, and, coming {{from another world}} than our world, can tell <b>me</b> things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know." ...|$|R
6000|$|Malcolm's heart felt easier, but {{he still}} growled. 'Then, Sir, if you assure <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> so without {{detriment}} to my honour, I will not quit you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hardly know, mother; {{she seemed}} to be so much older than I am. Sometimes when she talked and laughed, I thought I liked her very much, and then a minute later it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{understand}} her one bit. But I do think that she would be very nice when one came to know her thoroughly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} to forgive, {{now that you have}} {{explained}} matters, Mr. Merrill" [...] said the storekeeper, and he smiled again. [...] "If my fibre had been a little tougher, this thing would never have happened. There is only one more request I have to make. And that is, to assure Mr. Duncan, from <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not detain him purposely." ...|$|E
6000|$|Did I {{pass the}} miserable hours in {{writing letters to}} Philip and then tearing them up? Or did I only fancy that I wrote to him? I have just looked at the fireplace. The torn paper in it tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> write. Why did I destroy my letters? I might have sent {{one of them to}} Philip. After what has happened? Oh, no! no! ...|$|E
6000|$|Dear Miss Plenty, {{pray for}} him and for <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> may <b>do</b> this one happy thing {{for those who have}} done so much for Your ever dutiful and loving ...|$|R
60|$|GUNNER. Oh, dont you think, because I'm a clerk, that I'm {{not one of}} the intellectuals. I'm {{a reading}} man, a {{thinking}} man. I read in a book--a high class six shilling book--this precept: Affirm your manhood. It appealed to me. Ive always remembered it. I believe in it. I feel <b>I</b> must <b>do</b> it to recover your respect after my cowardly behavior. Therefore I affirm it in your presence. <b>I</b> tell <b>that</b> man who insulted <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> give a damn for him. And neither <b>I</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "When did {{you ever}} ask <b>me</b> {{anything}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not tell you? You remember, for example, my giving you the material for your paper about {{the temple of the}} Vestals." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is no one}} {{to give it to}} us but God, poor Biddy, and {{he alone}} can say what, in his gracious mercy, it may please him to do. Ah! Biddy, I fear <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> an unwise and thoughtless thing, to bring my poor Rose to such a place as this. Were it to be done over again, the riches of Wall Street would not tempt me to be guilty of so wrong a thing!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very little. Just told me your name, {{and that}} you had arrived here. Why should I have asked for more? What could he have told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know already from my brother's letter? Three lines! And how much they meant to me! I will show them to you one day, Kirylo Sidorovitch. But now I must go. The first talk between us cannot {{be a matter of}} five minutes, so we had better not begin...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I also," [...] he said. [...] "Mine {{will come}} soon. I looked upon the radiant beauty of Issus {{nearly a year}} since. It {{has always been a}} source of keen wonder to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not drop dead at the first sight of that hideous countenance. And her belly! By my first ancestor, but never was there so {{grotesque}} a figure in all the universe. That they should call such a one Goddess of Life Eternal, Goddess of Death, Mother of the Nearer Moon, and fifty other equally impossible titles, is quite beyond me." ...|$|E
6000|$|On May 15/25 Montague {{acknowledged}} Arlington's {{letter to}} which Charles refers; {{he has been}} approached, as to Marsilly, by the Spanish resident, 'but I could not tell how to do anything in the business, never having heard of the man, or that he was employed by my Master [Charles] in any business. I have sent you also {{a copy of a}} letter which an Englishman writ to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know, in behalf of Roux de Marsilly, but that does not come by the post,' being too secret.* ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} quite shaken down yet," [...] he said, [...] "and do not press {{you to come}} over to see me until I have got {{everything}} into order. I am sure you feel thankful to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not expect you to be tramping over to see me after your long day's work here. By the time your people arrive I shall have everything in order. I am expecting the things I have written for and my own heavy baggage in a few days from Wellington." ...|$|R
60|$|The most {{surprising}} {{part of the}} whole thing to <b>me</b> was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not feel in the least alarmed. If anything, I was rather pleased to see him. It was company.|$|R
