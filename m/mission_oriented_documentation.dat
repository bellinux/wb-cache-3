40|$|According to {{the demand}} for {{condition-based}} maintenance online decision making among a <b>mission</b> <b>oriented</b> fleet, an intelligent maintenance decision making method based on Multi-agent and heuristic rules is proposed. The process of condition-based maintenance within an aircraft fleet (each containing one or more Line Replaceable Modules) based on multiple maintenance thresholds is analyzed. Then the process is abstracted into a Multi-Agent Model, a 2 -layer model structure containing host negotiation and independent negotiation is established, and the heuristic rules applied to global and local maintenance decision making is proposed. Based on Contract Net Protocol and the heuristic rules, the maintenance decision making algorithm is put forward. Finally, a fleet consisting of 10 aircrafts on a 3 -wave continuous mission is illustrated to verify this method. Simulation results indicate that this method can improve {{the availability of the}} fleet, meet mission demands, rationalize the utilization of support resources and provide support for online maintenance decision making among a <b>mission</b> <b>oriented</b> fleet. 1...|$|R

Using a combination of language and logics developed at the University of Idaho, vehicles are able to construct maps of mine-like objects and area clearance. High-resolution maps are constructed using information collected on the host vehicle and reported by others, while low-resolution maps are built from estimates formed from inferences drawn upon shared knowledge. The software modules are developed using the <b>Mission</b> <b>Oriented</b> Operating Suite and simulations are provided that demonstrate the performance of the approach. I...|$|R
