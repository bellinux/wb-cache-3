He also notes House's propensity to hire attractive women, which led him to this situation. House argues that he's [...] "not that guy"; Wilson retorts [...] "every guy is that guy".

However, the hospital used for most other exterior and a few interior shots is not in Seattle; these scenes are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills, California. The exterior of Meredith Grey's house, also known as the Intern House, is real. In the show, the address of Grey's home is 613 Harper Lane, but in real life there is no such place. The actual home is located at 303 W. Comstock St., Seattle, Washington. Most scenes are taped at Prospect Studios in Los Feliz, just east of Hollywood, where the Grey's Anatomy set occupies six sound stages. Some outside scenes are shot at the Warren G.

Due to their admiration, the network offered Ramirez a role on any ABC television series, of her choice, which ultimately led in her choosing Grey's Anatomy. Ramirez further explained that at her initial audition, the producers liked her, and had intentions to add her to the show, but did not know who to cast her as. She also said she was in awe of how the executives said, [...] "Pick a show, any show", a statement she deemed rare. Ramirez's character was given recurring status in the second season, having been conceived as a love interest for George O'Malley. At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Grey's relationship. When asked of this, Torres said: [...] "You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] Discussing Izzie Stevens' relationship with Alex Karev, Katherine Heigl described her character as naive enough to believe she can save him, assessing that: [...] "Even when Alex was a complete dirtbag to her, she forgave him and gave him another chance. And he really screwed her over." [...] Writer Stacy McKee described Izzie's moving on from Alex to patient Denny Duquette as [...] "karma", as Alex previously treated Izzie badly, yet as he begins to realize his true feelings, he is forced to watch her embark on a romance with Denny, regarded by her as [...] "undeniably handsome and totally charming". Series writer Blythe Robe commented on Izzie and Denny: [...] "I love the way Izzie lights up when she’s around him. I love their relationship because it's so pure and honest and completely game free." [...] Writer Elizabeth Klaviter noted at this time the way Izzie [...] "seems to be sacrificing her reputation because of her feelings for Denny." [...] When Izzie deliberately worsened Denny's condition to move him up the transplant list, series writer Mark Wilding questioned the morality of the actions, asking: [...] "Is Izzie bad for doing it? Is she tremendously irresponsible? She cut the wire for love so does that make her action understandable?" [...] Series creator Shonda Rhimes discussed costuming choices in the scene which saw the interns gather around Denny's deathbed, explaining: [...] "Meredith and George and Cristina and Callie and Alex are all dressed, not for a prom, but for a funeral. Everyone in dark colors, everyone dressed somberly. As if they were in mourning. Only Izzie is in happy pink. Only Izzie looks like she didn't know this was coming." ...|$|E

2500|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI), or nuclear magnetic {{resonance imaging}} (NMRI), is primarily a medical imaging technique most commonly used in radiology to visualize the structure and function of the body. Dr. Raymond Damadian, an Armenian-American scientist, who while researching the analytical properties of magnetic resonance, created the world's first magnetic resonance imaging machine in 1972. Damadian filed the first patent for an <b>MRI</b> <b>machine,</b> U.S. patent #3,789,832 on March 17, 1972, which was later issued to him on February 5, 1974. Damadian along with Larry Minkoff and Michael Goldsmith, subsequently went on to perform the first MRI body scan {{of a human being}} on July 3, 1977. Reflecting the fundamental importance and applicability of MRI in medicine, Paul Lauterbur of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Sir Peter Mansfield of the University of Nottingham were awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their [...] "discoveries concerning magnetic resonance imaging." [...] The award was vigorously protested by Damadian, founder of FONAR Corporation, who claimed that he invented the MRI and that Lauterbur and Mansfield had merely refined the technology.|$|E
2500|$|A {{magnetic}} resonance imaging instrument (MRI scanner), or [...] "nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} (NMR) imaging" [...] scanner as it was originally known, uses powerful magnets to polarize and excite hydrogen nuclei (i.e., single protons) of water molecules in human tissue, producing a detectable signal which is spatially encoded, resulting in images of the body. The <b>MRI</b> <b>machine</b> emits a radio frequency (RF) pulse at the resonant frequency of the hydrogen atoms on water molecules. Radio frequency antennas ("RF coils") send the pulse {{to the area of}} the body to be examined. The RF pulse is absorbed by protons, causing their direction with respect to the primary magnetic field to change. When the RF pulse is turned off, the protons [...] "relax" [...] back to alignment with the primary magnet and emit radio-waves in the process. This radio-frequency emission from the hydrogen-atoms on water is what is detected and reconstructed into an image. The resonant frequency of a spinning magnetic dipole (of which protons are one example) is called the Larmor frequency and is determined by the strength of the main magnetic field and the chemical environment of the nuclei of interest. MRI uses three electromagnetic fields: a very strong (typically 1.5 to 3 teslas) static magnetic field to polarize the hydrogen nuclei, called the primary field; gradient fields that can be modified to vary in space and time (on the order of 1kHz) for spatial encoding, often simply called gradients; and a spatially homogeneous radio-frequency (RF) field for manipulation of the hydrogen nuclei to produce measurable signals, collected through an RF antenna.|$|E
