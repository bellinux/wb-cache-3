40|$|Background: The {{medication}} cart can {{be filled}} using an automated system or a manual method and when using a manual method the <b>medication</b> can be <b>arranged</b> either by round time or by medication name. For the manual methods, it is {{hypothesized that the}} latter method {{would result in a}} lower frequency of medication administration errors because nurses are forced to read the medication labels, but evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the frequency of medication administration errors of two different manual medication cart filling methods, namely <b>arranging</b> <b>medication</b> by round time or by medication name. Design: A prospective, observational study with a before-after design. Participants and settings: Eighty-six patients who stayed on an orthopaedic ward in one university medical centre in the Netherlands were included. Methods: Disguised observation was used to detect medication administration errors. The medication cart filling method in usual care was to fill the cart with <b>medication</b> <b>arranged</b> by round time. The intervention was the implementation of the second medication cart filling method, where the medication cart was filled by arranging medicines by their names. The primary outcome was the frequency of medication administrations with one or more error(s) after the intervention compared with before the intervention. The secondary outcome was the frequency of subtypes of medication administration errors. Results: After the intervention 170 of 740 (23. 0 %) medication administrations with one or more medication administration error(s) were observed compared to 114 of 589 (19. 4 %) before the intervention (odds ratio 1. 24 [95 % confidence interval 0. 95 - 1. 62]). The distribution of subtypes of medication administration errors before and after the intervention was statistically significantly different (p < 0. 001). Analysis of subtypes revealed more omissions and wrong time errors after the intervention than before the intervention. Unauthorized medication errors were detected more frequently before the intervention than after the intervention. Conclusion: The frequency of medication administration errors with the medication cart filling method where the <b>medication</b> is <b>arranged</b> by name was not statistically significantly different compared to the medication cart filling method where the <b>medication</b> is <b>arranged</b> by round time.

During the mid watch on 3 May 1945, Baya rendezvoused with Lagarto and their captains discussed plans. The latter’s proposed to dive on the convoy’s track {{to make contact}} at 14:00, {{in the middle of}} the afternoon watch; Baya would be 10 to 15 mi further along the track, “if no contact was made we Baya were to intercept at 20:00 at convoy’s possible 21:30 position.” That having been arranged, the boats set course for their <b>arranged</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Exeter (St Davids) station {{had been}} built in a one-sided {{arrangement}} with separate up and down sections. The increase of traffic {{and the arrival of}} LSWR trains made this very difficult to operate; in 1862 work was started on a new conventionally <b>arranged</b> <b>station,</b> and this was opened in July 1864. Taunton station received a corresponding treatment in August 1868. At Weston-super-Mare, the terminus was modernised and expanded, and the branch line doubled, in 1866. At Bristol, the project was much more difficult; work started in March 1871 but was not completed until 1 January 1878, after amalgamation of the B&ER and the GWR; the new station was joint with the Midland Railway.|$|R
50|$|The {{double-sided}} and symmetrically <b>arranged</b> <b>station</b> building {{consisted of}} two protruding wings and a recessed central section. The neo-classical single-storey building included two 96 metres-long train sheds with arched arcades, one covering the arrival platforms and the other the departure platforms. Two other tracks ran between the train sheds that were designed for the movement of rolling stock. The two station buildings differed only with regard to a few functionally-related trifles. The departure platforms could only be accessed through an entrance hall, which contained a ticket office, baggage acceptance facilities and restaurants. In contrast, the arrival platforms were freely accessible and bigger to cope better with the surge of traffic when trains arrived.|$|R

40|$|Array {{measurements}} {{have become}} a valuable tool for site response characterization in a non-invasive way. The array design, i. e. size, geometry and number of stations, has a great influence {{in the quality of}} the obtained results. From the previous parameters, the number of available stations uses to be the main limitation for the field experiments, because of the economical and logistical constraints that it involves. Sometimes, from the initially planned array layout, carefully designed before the fieldwork campaign, one or more stations do not work properly, modifying the prearranged geometry. Whereas other times, there is not possible to set up the desired array layout, {{because of the lack of}} stations. Therefore, for a planned array layout, the number of operative stations and their arrangement in the array become a crucial point in the acquisition stage and subsequently in the dispersion curve estimation. In this paper we carry out an experimental work to analyze which is the minimum number of stations that would provide reliable dispersion curves for three prearranged array configurations (triangular, circular with central station and polygonal geometries). For the optimization study, we analyze together the theoretical array responses and the experimental dispersion curves obtained through the f-k method. In the case of the f-k method, we compare the dispersion curves obtained for the original or prearranged arrays with the ones obtained for the modified arrays, i. e. the dispersion curves obtained when a certain number of stations n is removed, each time, from the original layout of X geophones. The comparison is evaluated by means of a misfit function, which helps us to determine how constrained are the studied geometries by stations removing and which station or combination of stations affect more to the array capability when they are not available. All this information might be crucial to improve future array designs, determining when it is possible to optimize the number of <b>arranged</b> <b>stations</b> without losing the reliability of the obtained results.
