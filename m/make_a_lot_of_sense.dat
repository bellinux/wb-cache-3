25|$|Once again a free agent, Nabokov {{signed a}} {{contract}} with the Detroit Red Wings on January 20, 2011; the Red Wings were one of the top teams in the NHL at the time, and Nabokov {{signed a contract}} for just $570,000 as a result. However as he had started the season in the KHL, NHL rules required him to be placed on waivers prior to joining the Red Wings, and thus be available at that salary to any team lower than them in the standings. He was subsequently claimed by the New York Islanders, who were one of the worst teams in the NHL at the time. As he had only signed with Detroit in hopes of playing in the playoffs that year, Nabokov refused to join the Islanders, stating that he didn't <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> to him why they claimed him. The Islanders suspended Nabokov for failing to join the team, and he sat {{out the rest of the}} season.|$|E
500|$|In 1811, Mälzel {{brought the}} Turk to Milan for a {{performance}} with Eugène de Beauharnais, the Prince of Venice and Viceroy of Italy. Beauharnais enjoyed the machine {{so much that he}} offered to purchase it from Mälzel. After some serious bargaining, Beauharnais acquired the Turk for 30,000 francs – three times what Mälzel had paid – and kept it for four years. In 1815, Mälzel returned to Beauharnais in Munich and asked to buy the Turk back. Two versions of how much he had to pay exist, eventually working out an agreement. One version appeared in the France Letter Palamede. The complete story does not <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> since Mälzel visited Paris again, and he also could import his [...] "Conflagration of Moscow".|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{reviews of}} the album, published by the LA Weekly and Newsweek, were positive. Rolling Stone critic Christian Hoard wrote that [...] "Octagon's verses often feel unfocused and random, but when he bears down he can be mesmerizing, channeling his quick-tongued rhymes with streetwise brassiness and cosmic vibrations." [...] Allmusic reviewer Marisa Brown wrote that the album [...] "doesn't always <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>sense,</b> but that's the beauty of it. It's a kind of concept album that concentrates more on the actual overall sound than the concepts. Its elements are all on {{the very edge of}} control, which is both exhilarating and terrifying at the same time; if it works, it could bring us to where we've never been, protect us from what may be, but if it fails, it could kill us all." [...] Hip Hop DX reviewer B. Love wrote, [...] "This is Kool Keith's best album in years—arguably even better than his classic Octagonecologyst—and marks a fine return to form for one of rap music's most distinctive and original talents." ...|$|E

500|$|Ghost of Sparta was {{announced}} on May 4, 2010, on PlayStation.Blog. According to Sony, Ready at Dawn utilized [...] "state-of-the-art visual technologies" [...] that allowed [...] "higher quality environments and characters." [...] Ghost of Sparta offers [...] "over 25% more gameplay" [...] than Chains of Olympus, while adding more enemies on screen and more boss encounters. Development of Ghost of Sparta took 23 months to complete. Due to Weerasuriya's schedule at Ready at Dawn, {{he could not}} return to direct; Dana Jan, the lead level designer for Chains of Olympus, became director for Ghost of Sparta. At Comic-Con 2010, Jan noted that when development began in 2008, {{the goal was to}} make the game bigger than Chains of Olympus, which had apparently pushed the PSP to its functional limits. Jan stated that Ghost of Sparta has taken the PSP to its [...] "absolute capacity", with another feature being more on-screen foes. The game concept was originally used as a teaser for players who obtained the platinum trophy from God of War III. The trophy revealed a site called spartansstandtall.com, which became the official site for Ghost of Sparta on May 4. Jan stated the reason they chose to have the game take place between God of War and God of War II was because [...] "It seemed to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> to fill in that void." ...|$|E
500|$|Dana Jan {{stated the}} reason they chose to have the game take place between God of War and God of War II was because [...] "It seemed to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> to fill in that void." [...] Jan said with some scenes, [...] "the team wasn't sure how gamers would react" [...] because [...] "God of War usually doesn't slow...down" [...] and the team [...] "worried if these scenes would be {{captivating}} enough to keep player interested and still feel like God of War." [...] For puzzles, Jan stated that they {{tried to make the}} outcomes unexpected because players assume that they will have to [...] "push something, carry a body or smash something with [...] blades." [...] Hinting at a possible future installment from Ready at Dawn, Jan stated that he is [...] "intrigued" [...] by the flashbacks in God of War and God of War II and that [...] "There's definitely a back story to Kratos that nobody's touched on." [...] For the character Deimos, Jan stated that the first reference was actually in the Chains of Olympus finale. In the game, Helios states [...] "Do you think that they'll survive?" [...] and Athena says [...] "They must." [...] Jan said that this line was [...] "purposefully put" [...] in that game and that there are also references to Deimos in God of War III. He confirmed that Kratos and Deimos are not twins and that while Kratos' father is Zeus, [...] "Deimos' father is more of a mystery." [...] He confirmed that a character named Dominus appears in the game (Kratos' original name) and [...] "the scene featuring a soldier named Dominus was a nod to that." [...] He also stated that he does not know where God of War: Betrayal fits chronologically in the series.|$|E

2500|$|The {{alternate}} U.S. {{version of}} Lammy's Stage 6, however, drew mixed praise and criticism. IGN called it [...] "a far off island [...] has that Japan-idol-talk influence... So {{if you were}} expecting {{to see one of}} the levels being in hell, well, it's not in there." [...] Similarly, GameSpot's Gerstmann made a later update on his March 26, 1999, review by commenting on the U.S. alterations to Stage 6, exclaiming, [...] "It doesn't really affect the game too much, since much of the game doesn't <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> to begin with." ...|$|E
2500|$|Max has {{a history}} of cheating, which Inside Soap said would make him the most obvious person, but as he has {{recently}} reunited with his former wife Tanya Jessop (Jo Joyner), it would be the worst thing he could do. However, the magazine said that [...] "Max thrives on passion and deceipt, so getting it on with Kat behind Tanya's back would be consistent." [...] They also said he was busy with his own problems, but had form finding Slater (Kat's maiden name) women irresistible (he had an affair with Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) years earlier). They said Kat's fiery personality would appeal to Max and [...] "he loves illicit liaisons with unsuitable partners". They felt he was bound to mess up his relationship with Tanya, but thought it would more likely be something else that would do that. Soaplife said Max was [...] "least likely even though he has the track record and the matching morals of an alley cat." [...] Actor Wood had previously promised a big storyline for Max, but Soaplife did not think this would be it. Soaplife later ruled out Max, asking [...] "why would he go for hamburger (Kat) when he has steak (Tanya) at home?" [...] All About Soap called Max a [...] "love rat", but doubted that he would cheat on Tanya again, but as it's Max, [...] "all bets are off {{when it comes to the}} bedroom", and said he was the second most likely suspect. In September 2012, Richie said he thought that Max was the most likely suspect, saying [...] "I think it's Max. You can't trust him!" [...] Wood stated that [...] "It would definitely be in keeping with Max for him to be having an affair. He's got a chequered history and women are his Achilles heel. So it would <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> for it to be him. It would be bad timing, though, because he's planning to get remarried!" ...|$|E
