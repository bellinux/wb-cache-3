25|$|DMT is {{generally}} not active orally unless it is combined with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) such as a reversible inhibitor of <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> <b>A</b> (RIMA), for example, harmaline. Without an MAOI, the body quickly metabolizes orally administered DMT, and it therefore has no hallucinogenic effect unless the dose exceeds monoamine oxidase's metabolic capacity. Other means of ingestion such as vaporizing, injecting, or insufflating the drug can produce powerful hallucinations {{for a short time}} (usually less than half an hour), as the DMT reaches the brain before it can be metabolized by the body's natural monoamine oxidase.

40|$|Putrescine oxidase (PuO) from Rhodococcus erythropolis is a soluble homodimeric flavoprotein, which oxidizes small {{aliphatic}} diamines. In this study, {{we report}} the crystal structures and cofactor binding properties of wild-type and mutant enzymes.

This similarity is striking in the flavin-binding site even if PuO does not covalently bind the cofactor {{as do the}} <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidases.</b> <b>A</b> remarkable conserved feature is the cis peptide conformation of the Tyr residue whose conformation is important for substrate recognition in the active site cavity. The structure of PuO in complex with the reaction product reveals that Glu 324 is crucial in recognizing the terminal amino group of the diamine substrate and explains the narrow substrate specificity of the enzyme. The structural analysis also provides clues for identification of residues {{that are responsible for}} the competitive binding of ADP versus FAD (~ 50 % of wild-type PuO monomers isolated are occupied by ADP instead of FAD). By replacing Pro 15, {{which is part of the}} dinucleotide-binding domain, enzyme preparations were obtained that are almost 100 % in the FAD-bound form. Furthermore, mutants have been designed and prepared that form a covalent 8 α-S-cysteinyl-FAD linkage. These data provide new insights into the molecular basis for substrate recognition in amine oxidases and demonstrate that engineering of flavoenzymes to introduce covalent linkage with the cofactor is a possible route to develop more stable protein molecules, better suited for biocatalytic purposes. ...|$|R

Two distinctly different enzymes with different substrate specificity, <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidases</b> <b>A</b> and B, have been purified and characterized. The following article discusses salient features of the differences between these two enzymes. ABSTRACT The two forms of <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> (MAO), <b>A</b> and B, continue to be of major interest to biochemists, pharmacologists, neurologists, and gerontologists. Despite intensive study {{for more than half a}} century, unexpected and unique properties of these enzymes continue to come to light. Recent studies have centered on their kinetic mechanism, their unique predilection for substrates related to the neurotoxic tertiary amine MPTP, and their putative role in aging and in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases. New and potent inhibitors of MAO A and MAO B continue to be developed because of their potential use in clinical medicine. Some are effective in the picomolar range but MAO B from different mammalian species shows remarkable differences in sensitivity to these agents. - Singer, T. P., Ramsay, R. R.
