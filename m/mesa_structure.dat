40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in applications of terahertz waves requires new techniques to obtain continuous wave terahertz sources. <b>Mesa</b> <b>structures</b> fabricated from high-Tc superconductor Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 +δ (Bi 2212) single crystal have been observed as an intense, coherent, continuous electromagnetic wave source in the terahertz (THz) frequency region. However, {{in order to produce}} coherent radiation with high applicable power, we need large <b>mesa</b> <b>structures</b> that enter a collective electromagnetic state in which their oscillations are largely synchronized in phase. On the other hand, large <b>mesa</b> <b>structures</b> cause a heating problem. In this study, we report on the critical current density dependence of mesa area and the crystal inhomogeneity to understand heating problems in large area mesas for terahertz radiation. Since the doping dependence of Bi 2212 is an important parameter, the as-grown Bi 2212 crystals were heat-treated at various temperatures under vacuum conditions. We have fabricated triple <b>mesa</b> <b>structures</b> from Bi 2212 single crystal using e-beam lithography and argon ion beam etching techniques with same area and with different area on the same chip. We investigated and compared characteristics of triple mesas which are on the same chip and next to each other.
