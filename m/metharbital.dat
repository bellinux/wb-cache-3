25|$|Open-label {{case series}} have {{suggested}} that primidone is effective {{in the treatment of}} epilepsy. Primidone has been compared to phenytoin, phenobarbital, mephobarbital, ethotoin, <b>metharbital,</b> and mephenytoin. In adult comparison trials, primidone {{has been found to be}} just as effective.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metharbital</b> can be {{synthesized}} from 2,2-diethylmalonic {{acid and}} O-methylisourea.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metharbital</b> was {{patented}} in 1905 by Emil Fischer {{working for}} Merck. It was marketed as Gemonil by Abbott Laboratories. It is a barbiturate anticonvulsant, {{used in the}} treatment of epilepsy. It has similar properties to phenobarbital.|$|E

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{accurate}} method is described for the quantitative determina tion of trimethadione, paramethadione, ethosuximide, <b>metharbital,</b> methsuxim-ide, phensuximide, mephenytoin, ethotoin, primidone and diazepam in serum. Gas chromatography, with temperature programming, is employed {{and each of}} the drugs or any combination of them may be assayed on a single specimen during a single rapid determination on 3 percent OV- 17 following chloroform extraction. Retention times relative to an internal standard (methyl myristate) are given. The recovery of the drugs is from 77 to 100 percent, the instrument response is linear for each drug, and the coefficients of variation are from 3 to 9 percent...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) method has been developed for the assays of five barbiturates in human urine using a new thermoresponsive polymer separation column, which is composed of N-isopropylacrylamide polymer. According to elevating the column temperature from 10 ℃ to 50 ℃, five barbiturates, such as <b>metharbital,</b> primidone, phenobarbital, mephobarbital and pentobarbital, became well separated by this method. Five barbiturates showed good linearity {{in the range of}} 0. 2 - 10 mg/ml. Good accuracy, precision and recoveries for these drugs were obtained at 1 and 5 μg/ml urine. The method with the new-type column seems to have high potential to be extensively used in forensic toxicology for analysis of many drugs and poisons by HPLC and HPLC-mass spectrometry (MS) (-MS) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{solubility}} profiles for <b>metharbital,</b> butabarbital, thiopental and thiamylal {{were determined}} in ethanol- water solvent systems at 25 c, {{in an attempt}} to define an approximate correlation between therapeutic activity and various solubility relationships. The relative lipophilicity of a drug molecule {{is an important factor in}} the physical and chemical processes involved when the therapeutic agent is introduced into a biological system. Binary solvent mixtures aid in delineating the relative polarity, in terms of dielectric constants, of these drugs. Spectrophotometric and, where applicable, gravimetric analyses, were utilized to determine the concentration of drug, in mg. /ml., in the 41 solvent systems ranging in composition from pure ethanol to pure water. The dielectric requirement (DR) of the barbiturates investigated, and those reported for barbital and vinbarbital, illustrated an approximate inverse relationship with the number of carbon atoms in the molecule. A similar correlation was found with the solubilities in pure water, and the ratios of the solubilities in ethanol and at the DR to the solubility in water. The therapeutic indices of duration of action and the period of time involved between administration of the drug and the time when the activity is first manifested increased as the relative polarity of these barbiturates declined. The duration of these pharmacological parameters were also found to increase with a corresponding reduction in the hydrophilic nature of this series of compounds...|$|E
