25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E

He said: [...] "I came into the studios early {{every day for a}} week to sing it by myself because at first <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> too clear. I wanted it to sound as though I'd been performing it on stage all week." [...] Lennon thought he should have sung it, remarking that it was more his style.|$|E
2500|$|Rostam Batmanglij was a prior fan of Jepsen's {{work when}} {{he reached out to}} her in the summer of 2014, after {{learning}} that she was in Los Angeles writing with various people. Jepsen was [...] "over the moon" [...] and the pair developed [...] "Warm Blood" [...] until March 2015, the first verse recorded as Jepsen sat on the carpet of Batmanglij's home studio. Batmanglij announced the track's existence via Twitter on April 29, 2015. The song has been noted for its experimental vocal effects, with Batmanglij scattering distorted vocal cuts throughout, a [...] "creepy" [...] quality that the pair immediately liked. Elsewhere, sections of [...] "Warm Blood" [...] were sung in a lower pitch: [...] "I had shown up one day, and <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> a little shot. The idea was that I would come back and sing it 'properly' once I’d recovered, but we ended up getting married to how it sounded since <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> kind of smokier, so we kept it." [...] Brad Nelson of the Guardian compared Jepsen's performance to that of Ezra Koenig's [...] "machine-produced flexibility" [...] on the Vampire Weekend song, [...] "Diane Young".|$|E

2500|$|The parting of Asha Bhosle and O.P. Nayyar was bitter, and {{probably}} therefore she has hesitated to give Nayyar his due. While talking about O.P. Nayyar {{in an interview}} with The Times of India, she once remarked– [...] "Whichever composer gave me work, it was because <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> suited to his music at that point. No one musician did me any favor by asking me to sing for him." [...] She gives the credit for her first big break to B. R. Chopra, the producer of Naya Daur.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2000, Westbrook {{was photographed}} at the British Soap Awards, where {{an image of}} her missing [...] was given {{to a series of}} tabloid newspapers, {{unveiling}} her secret and highlighting her excessive drug abuse. Westbrook was checked into rehab and, six months later, she appeared on the Channel 4 show The Priory with the claim that she was clean and had been free from drugs for months. However, hosts Jamie Theakston and Zoë Ball struggled to get coherent answers from Westbrook, who was under the influence of drugs despite her claims of abstinence. Reflecting back on the event in 2002, Westbrook commented [...] "I said I was clean, but it was obvious I wasn't. I looked about 50, and <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> shaky. I should never have been allowed on. They wanted to laugh at me, rip me apart. I despise that sort of thing, but it did me the world of good because watching it I realised, 'I'm so ill.'
