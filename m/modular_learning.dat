40|$|Abstract. This chapter explores <b>modular</b> <b>learning</b> in {{artificial}} {{neural networks}} for intelligent robotics. Mainly inspired from neurobiological aspects, the modularity concept {{can be used}} to design artificial neural networks. The main theme of this chapter is to explore the organization, the complexity and the learning of modular artificial neural networks. A robust modular neural architecture is then developed for the position/orientation control of a robot manipulator with visual feedback. Simulations prove that the <b>modular</b> <b>learning</b> enhances the artificial neural networks capabilities to learn and approximate complex problems. The proposed bidirectional <b>modular</b> <b>learning</b> architecture avoids the neural networks well-known limitations. Simulation results on a 7 degrees of freedom robot-vision system are reported to show the performances of the modular approach to learn a high-dimensional nonlinear problem. <b>Modular</b> <b>learning</b> is thus an appropriate solution to robot learning complexity due to limitations on the amount of available training data, the real-time constraint, and the real-world environment. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Many {{real world}} {{classification}} problems involve high dimensional inputs {{and a large}} number of classes. Feature extraction and <b>modular</b> <b>learning</b> approaches can be used to simplify such problems. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical multiclassifier paradigm in which a C-class problem is recursively decomposed into C − 1 two-class problems. A generalized <b>modular</b> <b>learning</b> framework is used to partition a set of classes into two disjoint groups called meta-classes. The coupled problem of finding a good partition and of searching for a linear feature extractor that best discriminates the resulting two meta-classes are solved simultaneously at each stage of the recursive algorithm. This results in a binary tree whose leaf nodes represent the original C classes. The proposed hierarchical multiclassifier architecture was used to classify 12 types of landcover from 183 -dimensional hyperspectral data. The classification accuracy was significantly improved by 4 to 10 % relative to other feature extraction and <b>modular</b> <b>learning</b> approaches. Moreover, the class hierarchy that was automatically discovered conformed very well with a human domain expert’s opinion, which demonstrates the potential of such a <b>modular</b> <b>learning</b> approach for discovering domain knowledge automatically from data. ...|$|E

40|$|Learning a {{large number}} of simple local {{concepts}} is both faster and easier than learning a single global concept. Inspired by this principle of divide and conquer, a number of <b>modular</b> <b>learning</b> approaches have been proposed by the computational intelligence community. In <b>modular</b> <b>learning,</b> the classification/regression/clustering problem is first decomposed into a number of simpler subproblems, a module is learned for each of these subproblems, and finally their results are integrated by a suitable combining method.

In this paper we present a broad framework for Generalized Associative <b>Modular</b> <b>Learning</b> Systems (GAMLS).

40|$|Intelligent virtual {{characters}} play {{an important}} role in creating an engaging player experience in modern computer games. Imbuing these characters with learning capabilities curtails the need to define every nuance of their behaviour during development. For this reason, there is growing interest in introducing machine learning techniques into game agent control architectures. However, computer game environments tend to be highly complex and dynamic, which necessitates the use of large state spaces to define effective agent behaviour. Traditional learning strategies are not suited to operating under these circumstances due to the "Curse of Dimensionality". Therefore, in order for their learning to be effective, agents require architectures that can handle complex dynamic state spaces. Within this thesis it is demonstrated that <b>modular</b> reinforcement <b>learning</b> and reactive / deliberative hybridisation techniques present a powerful combination for the implementation of effective game agent architectures. A novel approach to <b>modular</b> reinforcement <b>learning</b> is presented that utilises a fine granularity of modules. This new approach necessitated the development and evaluation of new methods for action selection, reward distribution and exploration. Furthermore, a new method of hybridising modular architectures with deliberative mechanisms is proposed and evaluated. Results demonstrate that agents implemented with hybrid reactive / deliberative architecture can outperform purely reactive and purely deliberative agents, particularly in resource constrained applications.
