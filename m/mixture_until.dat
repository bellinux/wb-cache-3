2500|$|The winery {{has earned}} a {{reputation}} in the Oregon wine industry as a pioneer in [...] "sensible and sustainable" [...] viticulture with co-founder and vineyard manager Ted Casteel leading the efforts to create the Low Input Viticulture and Enology (LIVE) certification program. At the vineyard, Casteel and his daughter and viticulturist Mimi Casteel utilize elements of both organic and biodynamic viticulture practices that minimizes the use of synthetic chemicals in the vineyard. This includes using sulfur sprays (similar to the Bordeaux <b>mixture)</b> <b>until</b> post-bloom. Later in the season they do use some synthetic products for reliability and to lessen the overall environmental impact of fuel, emission and labor cost that repeated organic spraying would require.|$|E
2500|$|As engine fires {{occurred}} with the B-36's radial engines, some crews humorously changed the aircraft's slogan from [...] "six turning, four burning" [...] into [...] "two turning, two burning, two smoking, two choking, {{and two more}} unaccounted for." [...] This problem was exacerbated by the propellers' pusher configuration, which increased carburetor icing. The design of the R-4360 engine tacitly assumed {{that it would be}} mounted in the conventional tractor configuration—propeller/air intake/28 cylinders/carburetor—with air flowing in that order. In this configuration, the carburetor is bathed in warmed air flowing past the engine, and so is unlikely to ice up. However, the R-4360 engines in the B-36 were mounted backwards, in the pusher configuration—air intake/carburetor/28 cylinders/propeller. The carburetor was now in front of the engine and so could not benefit from engine heat, and also made more traditional short term carburetor heat systems unsuitable. Hence, when intake air was cold and humid, ice gradually obstructed the carburetor air intake, which in turn gradually increased the richness of the air/fuel <b>mixture</b> <b>until</b> the unburned fuel in the exhaust caught fire. Three engine fires of this nature led to the first loss of an American nuclear weapon.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{analytical}} method for predicting characteristics of building composite materials is proposed. It {{is based on}} the properties of their components and on the following key assumptions: characteristics of a composite on the contact surfaces of the matrix and the filler are not worse than the parameters of any of the components of the material; the properties of the matrix are taken as isotropic and equal over the whole volume of the environment that is provided by the technology of preparation of mixtures; the filler of the composite consists of particles-grains which size is so small that their properties can be considered isotropic, however, the particles are still not nanoscale; the material as a whole and its components obey the Hooke's law and the rule of <b>mixtures</b> <b>until</b> the destruction of any part of the composite; the elastic stage of the work material is reviewed. The approach is more close to the experimental values of the ultimate strength and elastic modulus of the material than other techniques...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to refine the {{microstructure}} of eutectic halides, candidates to polaritonic metamaterials, through the directional solidification of ternary compositions. NaCl–LiF–CaF 2 ternary composites have been solidified using Bridgman and micro-pulling-down techniques at pulling rates from 3 to 300 mm/h for the first time. The interparticle spacing is 12 % smaller for this composition than for the binary fibrous NaCl–LiF eutectic. Conditions for solidification and growth in order to generate ternary aligned microstructures are discussed. The very small amount of melt remaining in the <b>mixtures</b> <b>until</b> 580 ∘C is probably the consequence of solid solubility of LiCl in NaCl {{and the formation of}} the reciprocal salt pairs, as in NaCl–LiF. However, it does not prevent the solidification of homogenous ternary microstructures.

5000|$|Rousong {{is made by}} stewing cuts of pork in a {{sweetened}} {{soy sauce}} <b>mixture</b> <b>until</b> individual muscle fibres can be easily torn apart with a fork. This happens when the water-insoluble collagen that holds the muscle fibres of the meat together has been converted into water-soluble gelatine. The meat is teased apart, strained, and partially dried in the oven. It is then mashed and beaten while being dry-cooked in a large wok until it is nearly completely dry. Additional flavourings are usually added while the mixture is being dry-fried. Five kilograms of meat will usually yield about one kilogram of floss.|$|E
50|$|The {{cheese is}} made by heating whole milk, adding quark, and then cooking the <b>mixture</b> <b>until</b> fluffy curds {{separate}} from a clear whey. The whey is discarded when the cheese mass reaches a temperature of 72 - 77 C.

Once a solid, firm ball is formed, the cheese is placed in a muslin or cheese cloth to drain. Generally, the cheese is prepared {{a few days before}} eaten, and is allowed to ripen in a cool place before consumption.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{have studied}} the {{kinetics}} of the quaternary structure change associated with the allosteric transition of aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase) (E. coli), inducing this change by exposure to the natural substrates (carbarnyl phosphate and L-aspartate). The presence of 30 % ethylene glycol slowed the quaternary structure change sufficiently {{for it to be}} followed by stopped-flow X-ray scattering at − 5 °C. After adding substrates to the enzyme, the change occurred, with a half-life of a few seconds, yielding a mixture of the two standard quaternary structures (or, conceivably, a state intermediate between them).

40|$|Many {{consumers}} {{do not follow}} recommended food safety practices for cooking egg dishes, such as pies, quiches, and casseroles, potentially leading to foodborne illnesses such as Salmonellosis. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends cooking egg <b>mixtures</b> <b>until</b> the center reaches 71 °C (160 °F). The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine what endpoint temperature information consumers receive from egg dish recipes, and if recipes would lead to safe temperatures when followed. Egg dish recipes (n = 226) from 65 websites, 50 cookbooks, and nine magazine titles (multiple issues of each) were analyzed. Time was the most frequently used indicator, given in 92 % of the recipes, with 15 % using only time. Other indicators included: set (89), browned (76), clean toothpick/knife (60), puffed (27), and jiggled (13). Only two recipes indicated final endpoint temperatures. Three recipes (a pie, a quiche, and an egg casserole) were chosen and prepared in triplicate to see if they would reach recommended temperatures. The pie and quiche were still liquid at 71 °C, and were well over the recommended temperature when cooked according to instructions, but the egg casserole was not consistently above 71 °C, when the recipe instructions indicated it was done and the center was light brown and “jiggled” This research indicates that consumers are not receiving information on endpoint temperatures in egg recipes, but the likelihood of foodborne illness is low since most dishes probably be cooked past the recommended temperature before the consumer considers them done unless there are many inclusions that may absorb liquid and reduce the appearance of liquid in the dish...|$|R
