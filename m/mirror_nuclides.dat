We discuss here the potentialities offered by this upgrade for the measurement of the β - ν angular correlation in the β - decay of <b>mirror</b> <b>nuclides...</b>|$|E
40|$|One of {{the still}} viable {{candidates}} for the dark matter is the so-called mirror matter. Its cosmological and astrophysical implications were widely studied in many aspects, pointing out the importance to go further with research and refine the studies. In particular, the Big Bang nucleosynthesis provides a strong test for every dark matter candidate, since it is well studied and involves relatively few free parameters. The necessity of accurate studies of primordial nucleosynthesis with mirror matter has then emerged. In order to fill this lack, I present here the results of accurate numerical simulations of the primordial production of both ordinary nuclides and nuclides made of mirror baryons, in presence of a hidden mirror sector with unbroken parity symmetry and with gravitational interactions only. These elements are {{the building blocks of}} all the structures forming in the Universe, therefore their chemical composition is a key ingredient for astrophysics with mirror dark matter. The production of ordinary nuclides show differences from the standard model for a ratio of the temperatures between mirror and ordinary sectors x = T'/T > 0. 3, and they present an interesting decrease of the abundance of 7 Li. For the <b>mirror</b> <b>nuclides,</b> instead, one observes an enhanced production of 4 He, that becomes the dominant element for x < 0. 5, and much larger abundances of heavier elements.
