40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical approach {{for determining the}} <b>motive</b> <b>nozzle</b> and constant-area of an ejector as an expansion device, based on cooling capacity of the split-type air conditioner using R 22 as working fluid. The use of an ejector as an expansion device in split-type air conditioner can enhance the coefficient of performance (COP) system. Typically, the split-type air conditioner may be installed on the geographical area with moderate or high outdoor air temperature using capillary tube. For this reason, the <b>motive</b> <b>nozzle</b> and constant-area diameters of the ejector must be designed according to these conditions. The diameters of the ejector are crucial in improving the COP. The {{results showed that the}} <b>motive</b> <b>nozzle</b> diameter is constant (1. 14 mm) with variations of the condenser temperature, whereas the constant-area diameter decreases as the condenser temperature increases...|$|E
40|$|Expansion work {{recovery}} by two-phase ejector {{is known to}} be beneficial to vapor compression cycle performance. However, {{one of the biggest challenges}} with ejector vapor compression cycle is that the ejector cycle performance is sensitive to working condition changes which are common in real world applications. Different working conditions require different ejector geometries to achieve maximum performance. Slightly different geometries may result in substantially different COPs under the same conditions. Ejector <b>motive</b> <b>nozzle</b> throat diameter (<b>motive</b> <b>nozzle</b> restrictiveness) is one of the key parameters that can significantly affect COP. This paper presents a new <b>motive</b> <b>nozzle</b> restrictiveness control mechanism for two-phase ejectors used in vapor compression cycles, which has the advantages of being simple, potentially less costly and less vulnerable to clogging. The new control mechanism can possibly avoid the additional frictional losses of previously proposed ejector control mechanisms using adjustable needle. The redesigned ejector utilizes an adjustable vortex at the motive inlet to control the nozzle restrictiveness on the flow expanded in the <b>motive</b> <b>nozzle.</b> An adjustable nozzle based on this new control mechanism was designed and manufactured for experiments with R 134 a. The experimental results showed that, without changing the nozzle geometry, the nozzle restrictiveness on the two-phase flow can be adjusted over a wide range. Under the same inlet and outlet conditions, the mass flow rate through the nozzle can be reduced by 36 % of the full load. This feature could be very useful for the future application of ejector in mobile or stationary systems under changing working conditions...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} analyses have {{been devoted to}} understanding the variety of flow regimes present in steady flow ejectors. Certain regimes are more conducive to achieving high performance (i. e. high entrainment ratios). In particular, the entrainment ratio is seen to be highest when the entrained fluid reaches a choked condition in the mixing region. In addition, the expansion regime of the <b>motive</b> <b>nozzle</b> (under-, perfectly- or over-expanded) appears to influence performance. In this paper, we propose a method to model an ejector of optimal geometry, designed for a favorable flow regime. Then, rather than focusing upon the maximization of efficiency, we seek operational conditions that maximise ejector efficiency, specifically the reversible entrainment ratio efficiency. Ejector efficiency {{is found to be}} highest at low compression ratios and at low driving pressure ratios. However, at lower compression ratios, the optimal area of the mixing chamber becomes large relative to the <b>motive</b> <b>nozzle</b> throat area. United States. J.

The main reason of installing ejectors in that type of systems is the recovering of the pressure energy, lost in the classic cycles during the throttling processes. The thesis consists basically of two parts, which both of consider the topic of parallel ejector operation. In the third part conclusions are presented. The first part is a simplified feasibility study for a concept R 744 cycle with three different ejector geometries working in parallel. MS Excel spreadsheet was created for general parameters calculations and for specific <b>motive</b> <b>nozzles</b> mass flow estimations. The second part contains results of measurement procedures on the SINTEF test facility. First, single ejector operation was examined. Basing on the test results, characteristic of P 2 GGC ejector geometry has been created.

Experiments were performed using wheat grains and water. The experiments deals with the performance and choice of suitable nozzle distance ratio and area ratio (area of <b>motive</b> flow <b>nozzle</b> to area of mixing chamber) for a central-type jet pump model with the following parameter: 7. 25 mixing chamber length ratio (length of mixing chamber to mixing chamber diameter), diffuser angle of 5. 5 º and wheat concentration ratio from 5 % to 35 %. The experimental rig was constructed such a way it can be changing the driving nozzle diameter and {{the distance between the}} nozzles to throat. In this study three different diameters of driving nozzles, namely (10, 12. 7 and 16 mm) have been used with one mixing chamber of 25. 4 mm diameter (i. e. three different area ratios of R = 0. 155, 0. 25 and 0. 4). The effect of nozzle to throat spacing to nozzle diameter ratio "X " with values of 1, 1. 5 and 2, on the jet pump performance was also tested under different flow rates and motive pressures. From the experimental work, the beast and suitable nozzle distance ratio and area ratio are obtained. The effect of wheat concentration on jet pump efficiency was also measured.

40|$|An ejector is {{a device}} that entrains a {{secondary}} flow into a high speed stream that is generated by expansion of high pressure motive gas [1]. These ejectors can be broadly classified into central ejectors and annular ejectors. A large majority of applications involve central ejectors where the motive gas flow is injected along {{the centre of the}} flow passage of the secondary flow. Dutton and Carroll [2] proposed an optimization procedure for such ejectors without taking the mixed supersonic flow region into account and generated the design curves considering the constant Total temperature, Molecular weight and Specific heat ratios. However in some applications involving high temperature gases such as in ramjet/ scramjet and gas turbine test facilities, an annular supersonic ejector is more appropriate where annular injection of the motive gas at the periphery of the flow passage is desired to avoid the exposure of the <b>motive</b> gas flow <b>nozzle</b> to the high temperature combustion product gases.

40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} {{mathematical model}} of the steam-water two-phase injector is presented. This model offers a method of estimating critical conditions of steam {{at the site of}} the <b>motive</b> <b>nozzle</b> throat, based on the local sound velocity in that area. Fluid thermal properties were based on a real fluid approach, where the CoolProp database was used. A different method was adopted to formulate governing equations for all passages of the injector based on the principles of the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. The pressure profiles of the injector at different inlet steam pressure and inlet water pressure were used to validate the proposed model; they agreed well, with a maximum relative rate of error within 9. 5 ％. Based on the validated model, the influence of different area ratios and coefficients of the diverse sections on the performance of an injector used in district heating was investigated. The main inlet parameters - steam pressure and water pressure - were within the range of 0. 20 ‒ 0. 60 MPa and 0. 14 ‒ 0. 49 MPa. The exergy destruction rate for every steam-water injector component was also computed. The results illustrated that the injector discharge pressure increases with the throat area ratio of the <b>motive</b> <b>nozzle</b> and mixing chamber. The isentropic efficiency coefficients of the converging section and diverging section of <b>motive</b> <b>nozzle</b> affects the entrainment ratio and compression ratio differently. The main irreversibility occurs in steam nozzle (41. 34 %) and mixing chamber (57. 95 %). The exergy efficiency of the injector decreases with the increase of mass entrainment ratio.

The purpose of replacing the capillary tube with an ejector as an expansion device in a split-type air conditioner using HC 290 is to further improve the COP. In developing the model, conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy equations were applied to each part of the ejector. The numerical results show that the <b>motive</b> <b>nozzle</b> diameter remains constant (1. 03 mm) under varying condenser temperatures, whereas the diameter of the constant-area decreases as the condenser temperature increases. It was also found that improvement of the COP can reach 32. 90 % at a condenser temperature of 55 °C.

Jet pumps main disadvantageousis low efficiency ranging 40 % and low pumping height which significantly limits its usage. One of the way to eliminate the low pumping height is to applying second stage of motive fluid. The other way is correct design of motive nozzles.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} efficiency losses in a vaporcompression refrigeration system, especially in a transcritical CO 2 cycle, is caused by the throttling process. The most promising solution is an application of a two-phase ejector as a compressor booster. The schematic diagram of this solution is presented in Figure 1. Efficient ejector operation is mostly dependent on ejector geometry, where the converging-diverging <b>motive</b> <b>nozzle</b> plays an important role. In this nozzle, the pressure potential energy of the fluid is partly converted into kinetic energy. The lower pressure at the <b>motive</b> <b>nozzle</b> outlet, the higher motive stream velocity and the better potential of momentum exchange with the secondary stream farther downstream. For given operating conditions (inlet, outlet pressure) the maximum achievable velocity for a simple converging nozzle is fixed by the propagation velocity (the speed of sound). For a converging-diverging nozzle, the velocity at the nozzle outlet could be larger and depends on the divergent design. For two-phase flows this issue is additionally complicated by an occurrence of non-equilibrium effects: although the fluid pressure decreases below the saturation pressure, a phase change process does not occur and the flow remains single-phase (metastable liquid flow). After the pressure reaches an enough low value the phase change (flashing) starts but the formed two-phase flow is still far from equilibrium. In case of the CO 2 transcritical cycle, the described flow is even more complicated because of the fluid transition from supercritical to subcritical state. All those phenomena significantly influence the motive mass flow rate, which is a key parameter for an ejector performance. Therefore, an accurate prediction of a local speed of sound in non-equlibrium two-phase flows is a crucial issue for an ejector <b>motive</b> <b>nozzle</b> design. Aforementioned circumstances were a motivation for research of a relatively simple and accurate way to describe the sound speed in two-phase flows. For this purpose, three approaches were analysed and compared, namely: homogenous equilibrium model, relaxation equilibrium model and delayed equilibrium model. Authors found that the absence of equilibrium can be relatively simply included in speed of sound predictions by usage of the relaxation models. Moreover, calculations performed on the base of an own implementation of mentioned models were compared to available experimental data...|$|E

40|$|As an {{important}} component in transcritical CO 2 refrigeration cycle, complex flow in ejector have not been clearly elucidated. In this paper, CO 2 flow in two-phase rectangle ejector was investigated experimentally by visualization measurement. The phase transition and the relaxation phenomena in the ejector were observed. By analyze the picture and the data collected from this experiment, we study the relationship between efficiency of ejector and the phase transition position in the ejector. Firstly, the microstructure of the flow pattern in the ejector was captured by a high speed digital video camera with a microscope to analyze the mixing process in mixing chamber. It was {{found that there were}} two stages with different characteristics in mixing process,which were named fluid mixing section and fluid equilibrium section. When fluid get through mixing channel, the ejector realize the majority functions of entrainment in the first stage, and the ejector also homogenize the velocity of primary fluid and secondary flow by the way of flow core expand to almost all the channel in the second stage. Secondly, based on the comparison ofÂ pictures collected from different ejectors under different operating conditions, we found that phase transition position and the form of phase transition was mainly depended on the entrance condition of <b>motive</b> <b>nozzle.</b> For an ejector that keeps the suction nozzle under the same operation condition, when the phase transition point trend to exit of <b>motive</b> <b>nozzle,</b> in mixing channel,motive flow will occupy more space meanwhile the relaxation phenomena occurred in longer region.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the theoretical and experimental research of an ejector expansion transcritical refrigeration system for military {{environmental control unit}} (ECU) applications with carbon dioxide as refrigerant.

40|$|Typically, the {{residential}} air conditioner uses capillary tube as an expansion device. The friction between refrigerant flow and pipe wall, {{and also the}} changing of the velocity along capillary tube cause energy loss during expansion. The pressure drop from the condenser to the evaporator caused by capillary tube is considered isenthalpic process. An ejector as an expansion device can be used to recover energy loss during expansion process. Many researchers reported that the use of an ejector as an expansion device in vapor compression refrigeration cycle (VCRC) may lead to increase in the system performance. In this study, the numerical investigations were carried out on {{the residential}} air conditioners using the VCRC for various cooling capacity with R 290 as working fluid. At present, the working fluid of R 22 is widely used as refrigerant in residential air conditioners. Because R 22 has a high global warming potential (GWP), as a result it must be phased out in the near future. Researchers recommended R 290 (propane) as a substitute refrigerant for R 22. As a natural refrigerant, R 290 is abundant and relatively cheaper than that of R 22. In addition, many studies reported that retrofit from R 22 to R 290 in air conditioner may result increase in coefficient of performance (COP). As a result, this study investigates the use of R 290 for replacing R 22 in residential air conditioner for various cooling capacity, viz. 2. 5, 3. 8 and 5. 0 kW or the compressor capacity of 1, 1. 5 and 2 HP.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to reduce the {{dependence}} on fossil fuels, a variety of research initiatives has focused on increasing the efficiency of conventional energy systems. One such approach is to use waste heat recovery to reclaim energy that is typically lost {{in the form of}} dissipative heat. An example of such reclamation is the use of waste heat recovery systems that take low-temperature heat and deliver cooling in space-conditioning applications. In this work, an ejector-based chiller driven by waste heat will be studied from the system to component to sub-component levels, with a specific focus on the ejector. The ejector is a passive device used to compress refrigerants in waste heat driven heat pumps without the use of high grade electricity or wear-prone complex moving parts. With such ejectors, the electrical input for the overall system can be reduced or eliminated entirely under certain conditions, and package sizes can be significantly reduced, allowing for a cooling system that can operate in off-grid, mobile, or remote applications. The performance of this system, measured typically as a coefficient of performance, is primarily dependent on the performance of the ejector pump. This work uses analytical and numerical modeling techniques combined with flow visualization to determine the exact mechanisms of ejector operation, and makes suggestions for ejector performance improvement. Specifically, forcing the presence of two-phase flow has been suggested as a potential tool for performance enhancement. This study determines the effect of two-phase flow on momentum transfer characteristics inside the ejector while operating with refrigerants R 134 a and R 245 fa. It is found that reducing the superheat at <b>motive</b> <b>nozzle</b> inlet results in a 12 - 13 % increase in COP with a 14 - 16 K decrease in driving waste heat temperature. The mechanisms of this improvement are found to be a combination of two effects: the choice of operating fluid (wet vs. dry) and the effect of two-phase flow on the effectiveness of momentum transfer. It is recommended that ejector-based chillers be operated such that the <b>motive</b> <b>nozzle</b> inlet is near saturation, and environmentally friendly dry fluids such as R 245 fa be used to improve performance. This work provides critical methods for ejector modeling and validation through visualization, as well as guidance on measures to improve ejector design with commensurate beneficial effects on cooling system COP.

Â Most of investigations presented in literature were focused on the analysis of the whole system including ejector of assumed geometry applied. This makes unfavourable conditions for the estimation of the possibilities of the cycle efficiency improvement since they also depend on the performance of the ejector applied in the system. The last one is undoubtedly complicated and separate issue since there is lack of theoretical model of two-phase ejector that was proved experimentally and could be applied in such analysis. Authors of the paper proposed own approach based on the pure thermodynamic analysis of the compression-ejection cycle. In this method it is possible to analyse the operating parameters of the ejector that are required by the refrigeration system in order to improve system efficiency. The analysis refers to determine the requirements of the refrigeration system for the ejector operation. The analysis presented in the paper is focused on the cases which have not been discussed in previous studies, i. e. application of two-phase ejector for subcritical cycles and application of two-phase ejector as a second step compressor in wide range of operating parameters covering both subcritical and supercritical cycles.
