40|$|We {{revisit the}} {{question}} of how performance measures are used to evaluate business unit managers in response to intra-firm spillovers. Specifically, we are interested in variation in the relative incentive weightings of aggregated “above-level” <b>measures</b> (<b>e.</b> g., firm-wide net income), “own-level” business unit <b>measures</b> (<b>e.</b> g., business unit profit), and specific “below-level” <b>measures</b> (<b>e.</b> g., R&D expenses) in response to spillover arising from either the focal unit’s effect on other business units or the other units’ effect on the focal unit. Our theory highlights complementarity between above- and below-level measures and the existence of an interaction between the two directions of spillovers. Based on a survey of 122 business unit managers, we report evidence consistent with an interaction effect and with complementarity between above- and below-level measures. In particular, we show that firms increase the weighting on both of above- and below-levels measures when they are coping simultaneously with high levels of spillovers on other units and spillovers from other units...|$|R

Health-utility measures impose more structure than monetary measures, with the result that individuals’ preferences often appear inconsistent with these measures; for the same reason, health-utility measures help protect against cognitive errors and other sources of incoherence in valuation.

Peasant farmers, however, connect them with poultry depletion, telepathic omens, and traditional witchcraft. Consequently, raptors suffer human–induced persecution. Using a qualitative content analysis technique, we investigated the interaction between farmers and raptors in areas adjoining the Chembe Bird Sanctuary. Our results unravel negative perceptions, attitudes and practices that could threaten the extinction of five raptors in the study area. We propose the use of transformative cognitive <b>measures</b> (<b>e.</b> g., raising stakeholder awareness, ensuring stringent law enforcement for raptors and protecting their habitat, and strengthening relational social capital) and physical <b>measures</b> (<b>e.</b> g., providing appropriate fencing and poultry breeding of high resilient phenotypes) to improve the co–existence between farmers and raptors...|$|R

40|$|Observational data {{of natural}} systems, as {{measured}} in astrophysical, geophysical or physiological experiments are typically {{quite different from}} those obtained in laboratories. Due to the peculiarities with these data, well-known characteristics processes, such as periodicities or fractal dimension, often do not provide a suitable description. To study such data, we present here the use of measures of complexity, which are mainly basing on symbolic dynamics. We distinguish two types of such quantities: traditional <b>measures</b> (<b>e.</b> g. algorithmic complexity) which are measures of randomness and alternative <b>measures</b> (<b>e.</b> g. ffl-complexity) which relate highest complexity to some critical points. It {{is important to note}} that there is no optimum measure of complexity. Its choice should depend on the context. Mostly, a combination of some such quantities is appropriate. Applying this concept to three examples in astrophysics, cardiology and cognitive psychology, we show that it can be helpful also [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{software}} {{systems are}} increasingly being developed for deployment {{on a range of}} architectures. For this purpose, it is interesting to capture aspects of low-level deployment concerns in high-level modeling languages. In this paper, an executable object-oriented modeling language is extended with resource-restricted deployment components. To analyze model behavior a formal methodology is proposed to assess resource consumption, which balances the scalability of the method and the reliability of the obtained results. The approach applies to a general notion of resource, including traditional cost <b>measures</b> (<b>e.</b> g., time, memory) as well as concurrency-related <b>measures</b> (<b>e.</b> g., requests to a server, spawned tasks). The main idea of our approach is to combine reliable (but expensive) worst-case cost analysis of statically predictable parts of the model with fast (but inherently incomplete) simulations of the concurrent aspects {{in order to avoid the}} state-space explosion. The approach is illustrated by the analysis of memory consumption...|$|R

40|$|Elements of {{measurement}} theory {{have recently been}} introduced into the software engineering discipline.

40|$|Research {{into the}} use of partnering in {{construction}} has become ubiquitous; however, a framework is needed {{that can be used}} to identify critical success factors (CSFs) that contribute to the successful use of partnering in projects. Based on a review of the partnering literature within the management discipline, a partnering framework has been developed to identify the CSFs for construction parties implementing partnering arrangements. The framework highlights the influence of contextual characteristics and management skills on partnering success. The CSFs identified and discussed in the framework are effective communication, conflict resolution, adequate resources, management support, mutual trust, long-term commitment, coordination, and creativity. The degree of success of partnering can be determined by subjective <b>measures</b> (<b>e.</b> g., perceived satisfaction of partners' expectations) and objective <b>measures</b> (<b>e.</b> g., cost variation and rejection of work).

40|$|Risk and {{uncertainty}} can be perceived in seemingly contradicting ways. Receiving a surprise gift can be exciting, whereas {{not knowing the}} outcome of a job interview can be incredibly anxiety-provoking. Even the same uncertain event, such as gambling, can simultaneously evoke positive and negative emotions. When is uncertainty positive, and when is it negative? We find that how much people value uncertainty depends on the context, and in particular, how value is measured. Namely, when considering pricing <b>measures</b> (<b>e.</b> g., willingness-to-pay), uncertainty is evaluated negatively, whereas when considering rating <b>measures</b> (<b>e.</b> g., enjoyment), uncertainty is evaluated positively. This effect holds when the outcomes are positive or negative, and even when changing the amount of uncertainty, uncertainty remains negative with pricing measures and positive with rating measures. We explore possible explanations, such as perceived selling price of uncertain prospects, and discuss crucial implications for both theory and applications...|$|R
