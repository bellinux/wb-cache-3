2500|$|... 3. In three {{dimensions}} {{a consequence of}} the Brouwer fixed-point theorem is that, {{no matter how much you}} stir a cocktail in a glass (or think about <b>milk</b> <b>shake),</b> when the liquid has come to rest, some point in the liquid will end up in exactly the same place in the glass as before you took any action, assuming that the final position of each point is a continuous function of its original position, that the liquid after stirring is contained within the space originally taken up by it, and that the glass (and stirred surface shape) maintain a convex volume. [...] Ordering a cocktail shaken, not stirred defeats the convexity condition ("shaking" [...] being defined as a dynamic series of non-convex inertial containment states in the vacant headspace under a lid). [...] In that case, the theorem would not apply, and thus all points of the liquid disposition are potentially displaced from the original state.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1954, F. L. Jacobs Company, a {{manufacturer}} of automobile parts based in Detroit, Michigan, announced that it had acquired both Mills Industries, Inc. and Selmix Dispensers, Inc. of Long Island City, Queens (another manufacturer of equipment in the vending and dispensing industries). [...] At that time the main products of Mills Industries were commercial ice cream freezers, frozen custard and <b>milk</b> <b>shake</b> machines and all types of vending machines. During 1953 and 1954, the company had added a coin-operated coffee vending machine, a three-flavor beverage bottle vendor, a citrus fruit juice vendor, and an ice cream package vendor to its product line. The intention of F. L. Jacobs Company was to operate Mills Industries as an independent subsidiary. [...] However, component parts for the equipment were to be produced in the factories of F. L. Jacobs in Detroit, Michigan, Traverse City, Michigan and Danville, Illinois. By September 1954, the controller of Mills Industries was James A. Pound. In November 1955, Mills Industries announced a project to consolidate, {{over a number of}} years, most of its operations in Traverse City, Michigan.|$|E

50|$|A {{malfunctioning}} skutter runs amok and rewires Red Dwarfs circuitry, producing {{two thousand}} wiring faults {{and making the}} whole ship a booby trap. When Dave Lister orders a <b>milk</b> <b>shake</b> and a Toffee Crisp {{from one of the}} snack machines, he inadvertently triggers the ship's self-destruct countdown. As the auto-destruct can only be over-ridden by a senior officer, all of whom are dead, Kryten performs a mind-swap: the mind of Executive Officer Carol Brown is temporarily placed into Lister's body so she can voice-activate the shut-down procedure; but the plan fails and the auto-destruct sequence continues. Everyone braces for death as the countdown reaches zero - whereupon the food machine dispenses Lister's <b>milk</b> <b>shake</b> and candy bar. It turns out the countdown was wired only to the vending machine, not to the ship's bomb — besides which Holly got rid of the bomb ages ago and never bothered to tell anyone.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, the U.S. Agricultural Research Service {{developed}} reduced-sugar, {{low-fat milk}} shakes for lunch programs.
