5000|$|Isaac II had a brother, Absalom Funk, {{named after}} their uncle Absalom, their father's brother. The younger Absalom's daughter, Hazel Funk Holmes, who was cousin to Arthur and Lawrence, {{took over the}} family sirup {{business}} during the early 1920s; she owned the property on which the sirup operation (Funks Grove Pure Maple Sirup) is now located and was the owner when U.S. Route 66 came through the area in November 1926. Hazel {{was the one who}} modernized the operation and ensured that the family business continued well into the future. Because Hazel's primary residence was still out East, however, she rented out her land to tenants who tapped the sugar maples every spring, made the sirup, and farmed the rest of the land, and she built a new sugarhouse to house a flue-pan evaporator. [...] The little peaked cabin that Arthur and Lawrence had used as a cooking house was moved to its present location on the farm, where Hazel used it as a guesthouse and as her summer home. Hazel also protected her land for the future: in her will, she placed her timber and farmland in a trust, for use by the family maple sugaring business. In that same trust, she insisted that their product be forever called maple sirup, spelled with an 'i' -- as was the preferred spelling in Webster's at the time to indicate a pure <b>maple</b> <b>product</b> made only from boiled maple sap and untainted by other sweeeteners or additional ingredients.|$|E
40|$|The current global social {{trends and}} quick {{development}} {{of information and}} communication technology determines and provokes its application in economy and in research environments. The lack of people with university education in the Czech Republic, when compared with other EU countries calls for innovation step to be taken, in terms of content and form of education offered to students. The correct selection of software as a support tool in the education process in business school such as in mathematics course can be a deciding factor even for cultivation habits of managers in their responsibilities, creative decision making process, managing their firms and how they react {{to changes in the}} business environment. The computer system <b>Maple</b> <b>product</b> from Canadian company Maplesoft that was developed thirty years ago, still offers a sound basis for the improving, and developing its use in communication, documentary, and service in education process. Also in many science disciplines, especially in those disciplines which require the application of quantitative methods, but also in commercial sectors. Thus, it seems the system is a good support tool, not only during its application in non-traditional methods of teaching (e. g. e-learning), but especially as an outstanding support tool in application of mathematics in economic studies and a perspective of building good professional habits for the future...|$|E

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis covers many branches of the <b>Maple</b> <b>Products</b> problem. The main purpose is to identify the flavoring principle in maple syrup.

The research work concerning decolorization of dark colored syrups, preparation of nonhardening and non-mottling sugar, as well as analytical studies of <b>maple</b> <b>products</b> for the detection of adulterants produced more definite results.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} developing a historical baseline of Canadian Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal maple practices and the contribution of these activities to the well-being (WB) of communities up to approximately 1950. This research measures WB using two unique frameworks developed for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities associated with <b>maple</b> <b>products</b> and practices. In order to describe WB in historical contexts the research used archival data obtained primarily from Library and Archives Canada (LAC) and Early Canadiana Online (ECO). Results from the research showed that in Aboriginal communities, dynamics related to emotional, physical and mental WB were referenced the most often among results. In non-Aboriginal communities economic and social dynamics of WB were identified as important influences of WB. Dynamics related to resilience were {{also found in the}} non-Aboriginal results. Furthermore, the research identified dynamics related to governance as important pieces of the historical contexts of <b>maple</b> <b>products</b> within Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities. The role of early government rules and regulations associated with <b>maple</b> <b>products</b> and the impacts of the Indian Act on Aboriginal maple producers are further explored and discussed. This research concludes by outlining the areas where more research remains to be completed...|$|R
