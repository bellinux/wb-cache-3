The results show that under all three scenarios, DCs 3 and 4 which had lower establishment cost, selected to establish. Under scenarios 1 and 3, mode changing cost is low, so the node 17 selected for <b>multimodal</b> <b>terminal.</b> Under scenario 2, mode changing cost is raised to 10, 000; such a high cost caused a change in multimodal route to avoid mode change; however, route structure changes very slightly.|$|E

30|$|As a new {{branch of}} {{location}} problems, location-routing problem {{is still under}} development by various researchers. Present paper considered a location-routing problem on multimodal network. This paper aims to model and solve two problems at the same time. First problem is to select multimodal routes from supplier to potential DCs along with locating <b>multimodal</b> <b>terminals.</b> Second problem is DC location with routing tours from located DCs to retailers. An integer linear programming proposed and a genetic algorithm developed to capture the problem structure. To validate mathematical model, analyze sensitivity and demonstrate algorithm performance, two small and large size numerical instances generated based on previous papers, and different cost scenarios applied to these instances. Scenarios were different in vehicle capacity, transportation modes’ costs, and mode changing cost. According to the results, for different scenarios, different multimodal routes selected. Changing mode change cost affects on establishing <b>multimodal</b> <b>terminals.</b> High mode changing cost caused products to be transported on just one transportation mode; decreasing the cost, however, led to changes in modes, requiring <b>multimodal</b> <b>terminals</b> to be established. Changing vehicle capacity cause a change in number of established DCs and retailers orders on delivery tours. Also, by changing transportation cost on multimodal network, model makes a trade-off between distance and transportation cost and selects a multimodal route with lowest cost. In large numerical instance, due to high complexity of the model, GAMS software failed to find an optimum solution within a reasonable time. In this case, genetic algorithm run under different scenarios and ended up returning solutions equal to or better than GAMS results, revealing good performance of the algorithm.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{deals with}} the {{implementation}} of the sample rate conversion subsystems of the digital front-end, at Intermediate Frequency (IF), and of a synchronization subsystem in the framework of a Software Radio receiving terminal. A recently proposed architecture is adopted and optimized for the realization of a <b>multimodal</b> <b>terminal,</b> the main operational mode of which is UMTS, but also capable to interface with GSM or IS- 95. In particular, a class of mul-tiplierless filters in conjunction with reduced complexity FIR filters is chosen for the rate conversion. The selected approach for synchronization is a modified MAX/TC algo-rithm that exploits dedicated sync channels, for the UMTS case. Its performance in terms of acquisition probability has been studied either in a classic AWGN channel or in a mul-tipath environment. The algorithms have been optimized considering an FPGA based implementation, where power consumption and occupied area strongly constrain designer choices...|$|E
30|$|Under {{scenario}} 1, mode changing cost (cost {{of providing}} mode changing facilities at multimodal terminals) {{is much lower}} than DC establishment cost (about one hundredth). Furthermore, transportation cost on road and railway networks, compare to seaway network, are triple and twice, respectively; and considered capacity for each DC is adequate to satisfy all retailers’ demands. Result show that under this scenario, only DC 1 (with lower establishment cost) established. Because of high DC establishment cost, when one DC can answer to all the retailers demand (high vehicle capacity), just one DC establishes. In this scenario, seaway has the lowest cost and mode changing cost is negligible. So multimodal route is consists of four seaway and one railway links and <b>multimodal</b> <b>terminal</b> established at node 2. Under scenario 2, mode changing cost is raised to 10, 000 (close to that of DC establishment cost). However, no change {{is seen in the}} results, i.e., seaway transportation still presents a costly justifiable approach, and similar to scenario 1, a <b>multimodal</b> <b>terminal</b> established at node 2. In scenario 3, mode changing cost is about five times larger than DC establishment cost. The results show that change in transportation mode is no longer economic, and multimodal route products transported from supplier to potential DC 1 along the railway network. With sufficient vehicle capacity for all the demands, only one DC is established. Under scenario 4, mode changing cost set to 10, 000 and vehicle capacity decreased to 70, so that a single DC cannot answer all the demands. In this scenario, both of DCs established with a different multimodal route and delivery tour for each DC. In scenario 5, differences between transportation costs for three modes are lower than previous scenarios. Again, mode changing cost and vehicle capacity are set to 10, 000 and 70, respectively. Results show that in the multimodal network, products are transport along road (due to lower distance) and seaway (due to lower cost) networks. Since DC capacity has not changed, retailer routes are the same. Sixth scenario is similar to previous scenario with raise in mode changing cost. In this scenario model, choose a multimodal route with no changing in modes, so railway network (due to its continuity from the supplier to DCs) is preferred over road network (with lower transportation distances) and seaway network (with lower costs). The results show that a change in vehicle capacity can change the number of established DCs and affect routs to retailers.|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{the usage}} of a {{particular}} urban or regional area have immediate effects on transportation, such as {{the development of a}} new <b>multimodal</b> <b>terminal</b> within a city, or the creation of a business park in its outskirts. Thus far, this correlation has been underresearched at a national level in Greece. As a result, its effects on trip generation and passenger flows has been underestimated at the planning level, leading to the implementation of projects that are neither viable nor sustainable. This paper proposes that land use changes ought to be considered in tandem with transport-related changes at the planning stage. To this effect, we present a three-step methodology for an integrated approach to capturing future trip generation: the identification of future trip-generating poles within the study area; the development of scenarios related to the probability of these changes occurring and their potential magnitude; an estimation of future trends in passenger flows. The methodology is applied to the Metropolitan area of Thessaloniki, Greece. Using data obtained from development plans, national statistical services and research projects’ and studies’ findings, we estimate future trip-generation subsequent to land use change.

First network transfers products from supplier (with determined location) to DCs via a multimodal transportation system. On second network, products are distributed among customers via routing tours started from DCs on a single-mode network. In this problem, different questions will be answered: which multimodal route should be used to transfer products to DCs? Is there need to change mode in determined multimodal routes?

40|$|Computer based {{simulation}} models {{have often been}} used to study the multimodal freight transportation system. But these studies {{have not been able}} to dynamically couple the various modes into one model; therefore, they are limited in their ability to inform on dynamic system level interactions. This research thesis is motivated by the need to dynamically couple the multimodal freight transportation system to operate at multiple spatial and temporal scales. It is part of a larger research program to develop a systems modeling framework applicable to freight transportation. This larger research program attempts to dynamically couple railroad, seaport, and highway freight transportation models. The focus of this thesis is the development of the coupled railroad and seaport models. A separate volume (Wall 2010) on the development of the highway model has been completed. The model railroad and seaport was developed using Arena® simulation software and it comprises of the Ports of Savannah, GA, Charleston, NC, Jacksonville, FL, their adjacent CSX rail terminal, and connecting CSX railroads in the southeastern U. S. However, only the simulation outputs for the Port of Savannah are discussed in this paper. It should be mentioned that the modeled port layout is only conceptual; therefore, any inferences drawn from the model's outputs do not represent actual port performance. The model was run for 26 continuous simulation days, generating 141 containership calls, 147 highway truck deliveries of containers, 900 trains, and a throughput of 28, 738 containers at the Port of Savannah, GA. An analysis of each train's trajectory from origin to destination shows that trains spend between 24 - 67 percent of their travel time idle on the tracks waiting for permission to move. Train parking demand analysis on the adjacent shunting area at the <b>multimodal</b> <b>terminal</b> seems to indicate that there aren't enough containers coming from the port because the demand is due to only trains waiting to load. The simulation also shows that on average it takes containerships calling at the Port of Savannah about 3. 2 days to find an available dock to berth and unload containers. The observed mean turnaround time for containerships was 4. 5 days. This experiment also shows that container residence time within the port and adjacent multimodal rail terminal varies widely. Residence times within the port range from about 0. 2 hours to 9 hours with a mean of 1 hour. The average residence time inside the rail terminal is about 20 minutes but observations varied from as little as 2 minutes to a high of 2. 5 hours. In addition, about 85 percent of container residence time in the port is spent idle. This research thesis demonstrates that it is possible to dynamically couple the different sub-models of the multimodal freight transportation system. However, there are challenges that need to be addressed by future research. The principal challenge is the development of a more efficient train movement algorithm that can incorporate the actual Direct Traffic Control (DTC) and / or Automatic Block Signal (ABS) track segmentation. Such an algorithm would likely improve the capacity estimates of the railroad network. In addition, future research should seek to reduce the high computational cost imposed by a discrete process modeling methodology and the adoption of single container resolution level for terminal operations. A methodology combining both discrete and continuous process modeling as proposed in this study could lessen computational costs and lower computer system requirements at a cost of some of the feedback capabilities of the model This tradeoff must be carefully examined.

30|$|To {{determine}} {{transportation cost}} on the multimodal network (from supplier to potential DCs), the following process is applied. As a first step, the matrix {{part of the}} chromosome is decomposed into its rows and in each row the intermediate nodes used along the route are identified. In the second step, transportation mode between nodes is distinguished. In third step, distances between nodes are determined and multiplied by the corresponding transportation cost; sum of the results gives total cost for each link. Finally, total demand for each DC is calculated and multiplied by link costs. Sum of these costs form the multimodal network transportation cost. Last cost function {{is the cost of}} providing mode changing facilities at <b>multimodal</b> <b>terminals.</b> To have the cost calculated, nodes which mode changes are happened should be identified. For this mean, inbound and outbound modes are determined for each node along multimodal links. If the modes are identical, then node may host no mode change; otherwise mode changing facilities need to be established on that location. Fixed cost of providing mode changing facilities is aggregated to form the fourth cost function.|$|R
30|$|The {{maritime}} shipping industry has, for many years, applied the ‘hub-and-spoke’ or ‘nodes-and-links’ concept, integrating multiple actors in one transport chain to achieve cost- and time-effective services.

The nodes-and-links concept encompasses various types of terminals, connecting each other as well as cargo origins and destinations, such as hubs, marshalling yards, freight villages, sea ports, dry ports, intermodal, conventional and <b>multimodal</b> <b>terminals,</b> and industrial and logistics zones [16, 38]. The nodes have to be close to a production and/or large consumption area and at corridor crossing points [21]. They have to: transform the traditional transit function over normal working hours into value‐added, round the clock transit, by quick transfer between modes and/or train to train; achieve a high fill coefficient of trains or last mile transport; have a high degree of reliability for the end customer; and the ability to find the best connection to reach the end terminal through integration into the whole network [1, 15]. These represent the key elements that contribute to managing transport networks efficiently.|$|R

Within this rich environment and with <b>multimodal</b> <b>terminals</b> {{that are able to}} connect to different wireless technologies at once, users are expecting to benefit from higher throughput and enhanced QoS. However, the coexistence of several wireless systems rises different technical challenges including interface selection, packet scheduling, multi-path routing and mobility management. At the network level, recent protocols such as MTCP and mSCTP allow session continuity and offer the possibility of seamlessly adapting IP routing during a transmission session. These protocols are mainly based on the use of a set of IP addresses that can be associated to the same terminal and user session. But at the access level, efficient packet scheduling mechanisms on multiple interfaces are still required. New rules and approaches are needed to select the most suitable technology that better fits QoS requirements considering the dynamic mobile user environment. In addition, optimizing energy consumption should also be considered in order to lengthen mobile terminals' battery lifetime.

40|$|AbstractThe {{transport}} system {{is often described}} as the lifeblood system of modern society. Roads constitute a fundamental part of this system for both passenger and freight transports. Freight transport is expected to increase throughout Europe by 80 % until 2050 (EU, 2011). ITF (2015) stated that international freight transport to ports will increase fourfold until 2050. This will, ceteris paribus, result in a severe increase of congestion and incidents. In turn, incidents will worsen congestion even more. This paper, which draws on current work in CEDR and PIARC, describes the role of the road in the freight {{transport system}}. The background to this paper comes from reports that state the road network alone cannot cope with the expected increase in transport flows. Important road freight areas and issues about how to reach a more sustainable freight system are identified and discussed in this paper. These discussions include <b>multimodal</b> <b>terminals</b> and operations, autonomous vehicles, ITS, infrastructure usage, economies of scale, and behaviour/educational issues. The function of the road, from a freight perspective, is manifold. It is used for small shipments over short distances as well as their counterparts. Road freight is most often necessary in the beginning and in the end of the multimodal transport chain (first/last mile logistics). Furthermore, road freight is the only mode involved in many door-to-door freight chains, as it is usually the only mode involved. Such a chain might constitute one or several truck movements. Peak car is widely discussed but peak truck/peak freight might be {{something that needs to be}} considered for many reasons. The European climate and transport policies push for a modal shift from road to other modes of transportation. To meet this challenge the market-based transport system must develop into a truly multi-modal system. A smarter utilisation of the transport system is important from the perspective of economic, environmental, and social sustainability. However, more importantly there is a need to make road freight more sustainable in itself. Therefore one important role for the road is to try to stimulate and promote the possibilities for modal shift while another is to optimize its characteristics...|$|R
40|$|<b>Multimodal</b> {{container}} <b>terminals</b> (MMCTs) {{are very}} complex and consequently require synchronization and balancing of container transfers at each node.

When dealing with export containers, the problem would be that of the handling and travelling time of the containers from when they first arrive at the port until the ship carrying the containers departs from the port. Owing to the dynamic nature of the environment, a large number of timely decisions have been reviewed in accordance with the changing conditions of the MMCTs. The model has been run and tested with a small-size problem using CPLEX. A more realistic model is extremely difficult to solve and is in fact proven to be computationally intractable (NP-hard).

30|$|Objective {{function}} (1) {{seeks to}} minimize costs including multimodal transportation costs and location-routing costs. First and second sentences are about location-routing costs which calculate cost of routing from DCs to retailers and DCs establishment fixed cost, respectively. Third and fourth sentences, respectively, calculate cost of transportation from supplier to DC on multimodal network, {{and cost of}} providing mode changing facilities as multimodal transportation costs. Constraint set (2) defines flow conservation on multimodal network and states that product flow inters to a node should be to equal product flow exits it. Mode changing can be happened only on <b>multimodal</b> <b>terminals</b> (nodes {{that more than one}} mode inters or exits the node). For each transportation mode, if products inter to a multimodal network and leave it with the same mode, mode changing will not happen and the corresponding variable (y_v) will be zero. Same logic uses for changing modes. Constraint set (3) illustrate this for each node v ∈ V_two. As accounted for by constraint set (4), sum of products arriving at a DC should be equal to total demands raised by the assigned retailers to that DC. Based on the constraint set (5), each retailer is assigned to exactly one DC. Constraint set (6) ensures that no product can be dispatched to a non-established DC and if DC establishment variable (z_j) takes zero, all the product flows ending to that DC take zero as well. Constraint set (7) assigns each retailer to exactly one vehicle, while the constraint set (8) limits the capacity of the vehicles and ensures that summation of assigned customers demand does not pass vehicle capacity. In each product delivery tour on road network, every vehicle once entered a node will definitely exit that node and constraint set (9) guarantees that. Constraint set (10) is to ensure that each and every vehicle is allocated to at most one DC. The absence of common links between DCs is promised by constraint set (11). The constraint set (12) assures that a retailer is assigned to a DC if and only if there is a route from the DC to that retailer. Constraint sets (13) and (14) state that vehicles can be dispatched only from established DCs. Constraint set (15) relates to sub-tour elimination, and constraints (16), (17), and (18) define variables. The last three constraints determine model variables signs.|$|R

The intelligent and <b>multimodal</b> mobile <b>terminals</b> should select the best access network at any time anywhere. However, the “best” is a complex and fuzzy concept, which has different meanings to different users and even to the same user under different conditions.

In this paper, we design a generalized and flexible framework for the access network selection in heterogeneous wireless networks. The framework is generalized because it considers various factors in a comprehensive {{way to get the}} solutions.

40|$|The {{container}} transport {{is the key}} factor for globalized markets. Due to this the shipping volume in the past 20 years grew by the factor of 5. Based on this, container terminals are very important transshipment facilities in global transport chains with a high amount of annual throughput and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The transport sector is responsible for {{a large proportion of}} GHG emissions. An increase of traffic and GHG emissions for any transport mode is estimated. However, emissions are caused by transport modes and transshipment facilities and have to be reduced for both. State of the Art methods of determining transportation caused emissions consider only transportation modes. Emissions in transshipment facilities were currently rarely applied. However, for calculating emissions along the entire transport chain, the emissions from transshipment facilities have to be taken into account. Furthermore the reduction of greenhouse gases is significant for both the terminal itself and for the entire transport chain. Derived from existing standards for calculation of GHG emission a calculation tool for container terminals has been developed. Based on the energy consumption of the handling equipment and storage facilities the tool calculates the overall emissions in terminals.

40|$|<b>Multimodal</b> {{container}} <b>terminals</b> are {{an important}} part of the logistics systems in international trade. Any improvement in the terminal efficiency is likely to reduce the costs of transporting goods, and to strengthen the trading position of the nation. During the import process, containers flow from ships to the storage yard for temporary storage and then are later moved to the hinterland by rail, or by road. The export process is the reverse of the import process. From the marshalling area, it is possible for a yard machine to carry an inbound container to the storage area and back with an inbound container in one round trip. This thesis investigates the inbound and outbound container process of <b>multimodal</b> container <b>terminals</b> in a multi-ship and multi-berth environment. The aim is to develop mathematical models and analytical tools for yard operation and planning. This study concerns the yardlayout, storage locations, operation strategies as well as the sequencing and scheduling of container process. Several models are developed for the scheduling of container process, taking account of planned and unplanned disruptions, and the intermediate buffer at the marshalling area. The problem is NP-hard and real-life problems often involve large number of containers. In addition, many schedules may not be feasible due to deadlock or violation of precedence-constraints. Good results were achieved on benchmark problems using the proposed innovative. In dealing with unplanned disruptions, reactive scheduling approach was found to give the results similar to as if the disruptions were planned in advance. Numerical investigations are also presented on various factors affecting the efficiency of seaport container terminals including the number of yard machines, and the number of quay crane. As with the various yard-layouts studied, it was found that containers are best stored in rows perpendicular to the quay-line with about 10 to 14 bays in each row. For a shorter ship service time, ideally the containers should be stored as close as possible to the ship. The best storage locations, however, are scarce resources and are not always available. Another model is developed for the best storage location as well as the best schedule for the container process. From an initial best schedule with predefined storage locations, the problem is solved by iterating through the refinement of storage scheme and re-scheduling. At a seaport terminal, ships are planned to arrive and leave within a scheduled time window. Nevertheless, a ship may arrive late due to poor weather conditions or disruptions at the previous port. Such delay may also affect its departure to the subsequent port. To minimise the impact of ship delays, port operators must consider alternate arrangements including re-assignment of berths, re-sequencing of ships and rescheduling of the container process. A ship delay model is developed and the problem is solved by combining branching and Tabu Search. The models developed in this thesis establish the relationship between significant factors and the options for increasing throughput by discovering the bottlenecks. The models are applicable as decision tools for operation planning, yard layout, and cost and benefit analysis for investment in infrastructures...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{assessment}} of emissions caused by logistics operations {{in general and}} their allocation to individual customers is a major challenge for logistics service providers. Presently, numerous standards and guidelines exist (e. g. ISO 14064 - 1, ISO 14065, DIN EN 14040) for the calculation of GHG-emissions caused by logistics processes. Due to missing or incomplete approaches, the assessments as well as regular updates are quite expensive and time-consuming. This endangers in particular the competitiveness of sme logistics service providers who need to gather and provide the relevant information for their clients. To support sme-logistics services providers by calculating and allocating GHG-emissions, a CO 2 -method kit has been developed, which was implemented in MS Excel. This method kit consists of various demonstrator-tools for each mode of transport and stationary processes in logistics systems. Even complex transport chains can be illustrated with this CO 2 -method kit as well. Overall, the method kit offers a pragmatic solution for everyday business. The underlying calculation methods determine the energy consumption, CO 2 - and CO 2 - emissions, distinguished between Tank-to-Wheel and Well-to-Wheel. Based on the resulting greenhouse gas values, logistics companies can now identify and carry out appropriate measures to reduce their CO 2 -emissions. The existing method kit is currently extended to include the determination of GHG-emissions of handling operations in <b>multimodal</b> container <b>Terminals.</b> An in-depth analysis of terminal handling operations {{as well as an}} analysis of influencing factors on resource energy consumption was needed to develop the CO 2 -method kit extension. As a first step, the layout and load data were analyzed to picture existing terminal types as well as the distribution of job orders for the observed period. In addition, crane cycle were deconstructed into sub-processes and transferred into standard processes. Following, container, weight and distance classes were defined for the {{assessment of}} the power consumption data. The power consumption data was collected by measurement devices attached directly to the cranes. In course of the evaluation the measured values were accurately assigned against the crane movements and processed orders in the period under review. Finally, average energy consumption values for crane cycles were determined for the defined container and distance classes, based on selected indicators. By data analyses, average energy consumption values can be assigned to container handling operations in terminals, taking into consideration of e. g. terminal layouts, container or weight characteristics. Furthermore, the examinations show that the influence of the covered route on the total energy consumption of a crane cycle is slightly higher than the influence of the container weight. Further results and identified dependencies (e. g. influence of the container classes or terminal layout) are shown in this paper. This paper presents results of the research project “Enhancement of the CO 2 -method kit for an exact determination of environmental effects in terminals”. The aim of the research is to enhance the CO 2 -method kit with a terminal demonstrator-tool to empower sme logistic service provider to determine GHG-emissions of handling operations in <b>multimodal</b> container <b>Terminals.</b> Therefore, power consumption measurements have been carried out and terminal input data has been analyzed...|$|R
