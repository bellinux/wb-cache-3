25|$|All the {{preceding}} types have water-based electrolytes, which limits the <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage</b> per cell. The freezing of water limits low temperature performance. The lithium battery, {{which does not}} (and cannot) use water in the electrolyte, provides improved performance over other types; a rechargeable lithium ion battery {{is an essential part}} of many mobile devices.|$|E
50|$|The device's use was a {{power device}} until more {{suitable}} geometries, like the UMOS (or Trench-Gate MOS) {{were introduced in}} order to lower the maximum electric field {{at the top of}} the V shape and thus leading to higher <b>maximum</b> <b>voltages</b> than in case of the VMOS.|$|R

25|$|The oxide {{forms on}} the surface of the tantalum, but it also grows into the material. For each unit {{thickness}} of oxide growth, one third grows out and two thirds grows in. Due to the limits of oxide growth, there is a limit on the <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage</b> rating of tantalum oxide for each of the presently available tantalum powders (see Figure 3).|$|E
25|$|A large Tesla coil of {{more modern}} design often {{operates}} {{at very high}} peak power levels, up to many megawatts (millions of watts). It is therefore adjusted and operated carefully, not only for efficiency and economy, but also for safety. If, due to improper tuning, the <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage</b> point occurs below the terminal, along the secondary coil, a discharge (spark) may break out and damage or destroy the coil wire, supports, or nearby objects.|$|E
25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors {{can be applied}} {{for a short time}} with an overvoltage, also called a surge voltage. The surge voltage indicates the <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage</b> value within the temperature range that may be applied during the lifetime at a frequency of 1000 cycles (with a dwell time of 30 seconds and a pause of 5 minutes and 30 seconds in each instance) without causing any visible damage to the capacitor or a capacitance change of more than 15%.|$|E

50|$|The 807 {{is not a}} {{good choice}} of tube for typical Ultra-Linear {{amplifier}} circuits, as the <b>maximum</b> screen <b>voltage</b> at 300 V is less than half the <b>maximum</b> plate <b>voltage</b> of 750 V. A possible solution is to use an output transformer with a separate ultralinear screen winding, such as the Acrosound TO-350.|$|R
25|$|Battery {{life can}} be {{extended}} by storing the batteries at a low temperature, as in a refrigerator or freezer, which slows the side reactions. Such storage can {{extend the life of}} alkaline batteries by about 5%; rechargeable batteries can hold their charge much longer, depending upon type. To reach their <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage,</b> batteries must be returned to room temperature; discharging an alkaline battery at 250 mA at 0°C is only half as efficient as at 20°C. Alkaline battery manufacturers such as Duracell do not recommend refrigerating batteries.|$|E
25|$|As the {{particle}} bunch {{passes through the}} tube it is unaffected (the tube acts as a Faraday cage), while {{the frequency of the}} driving signal and the spacing of the gaps between electrodes are designed so that the <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage</b> differential appears as {{the particle}} crosses the gap. This accelerates the particle, imparting energy to it in the form of increased velocity. At speeds near the speed of light, the incremental velocity increase will be small, with the energy appearing as an increase in the mass of the particles. In portions of the accelerator where this occurs, the tubular electrode lengths will be almost constant.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February 2017 Toyota {{recalled}} all of {{the roughly}} 2,800 zero-emission Mirai {{cars on the road}} due to problems with the output voltage generated by their fuel cell system. According to Toyota, under unique driving conditions, such as if the accelerator pedal is depressed to the wide open throttle position after driving on a long descent while using cruise control, there was a possibility the output voltage generated by the fuel cell boost converter could exceed the <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage.</b> Toyota dealers will update the fuel cell system software at no cost to the customer, it said. The process will take about half an hour, it said.|$|E

25|$|On January 20, the NTSB {{declared}} that overvoltage {{was not the}} cause of the Boston incident, as voltage did not exceed the battery limit of 32 V, and the charging unit passed tests. The battery had signs of short circuiting and thermal runaway. Despite this, on January 24 the NTSB announced that it had not yet pinpointed the cause of the Boston fire; the FAA would not allow U.S.-based Dreamliners to fly again until the problem was found and corrected. In a press briefing that day, NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said that the NTSB had found evidence of failure of multiple safety systems designed to prevent these battery problems, and stated that fire must never happen on an aircraft. The Japan Transport Safety Board (JTSB) has said on January 23 that the battery in ANA jets in Japan reached a <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage</b> of 31 V (lower than the 32 V limit like the Boston JAL 787), but had a sudden unexplained voltage drop to near zero. All cells had signs of thermal damage before thermal runaway. ANA and JAL had replaced several 787 batteries before the mishaps. As of January 29, 2013, JTSB approved the Yuasa factory quality control while the American NTSB continues to look for defects in the Boston battery.|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternative}} {{failure mode}} can be encountered where large value resistors are used (hundreds of kilohms and higher). [...] Resistors {{are not only}} specified with a maximum power dissipation, but also for a <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage</b> drop. [...] Exceeding this voltage causes the resistor to degrade slowly reducing in resistance. [...] The voltage dropped across large value resistors can be exceeded before the power dissipation reaches its limiting value. [...] Since the <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage</b> specified for commonly encountered resistors is a few hundred volts, {{this is a problem}} only in applications where these voltages are encountered.|$|E
2500|$|As {{in other}} areas of electronics, {{volumetric}} efficiency measures the performance of electronic function per unit volume. For capacitors, the volumetric efficiency is measured with the [...] "CV product", calculated by multiplying the capacitance (C) by the <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage</b> rating (V), divided by the volume. From 1970 to 2005, volumetric efficiencies have improved dramatically.|$|E

50|$|The slash rating, {{under the}} United States National Electrical Code, {{is given to}} circuit {{interrupt}} hardware and specifies a <b>maximum</b> line-to-ground <b>voltage</b> rating in combination with a <b>maximum</b> line-to-line <b>voltage</b> rating. One common application would be for a three-phase electrical loads. For example a 120/240V rating can disqualify a circuit breaker for use with a delta system load that would otherwise work with a wye system load.|$|R
2500|$|The voltage {{standing}} wave ratio (VSWR) at a port, represented by the lower case 's', is a similar measure of port match to return loss but is a scalar linear quantity, {{the ratio of the}} {{standing wave}} <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage</b> to the standing wave minimum voltage. It therefore relates to the magnitude of the voltage reflection coefficient and hence to the magnitude of either [...] for the input port or [...] for the output port.|$|E
2500|$|In theory, the <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage</b> {{generated}} {{by such a}} cell is simply {{the difference between the}} (quasi-)Fermi level of the TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte, about 0.7V under solar illumination conditions (Voc). That is, if an illuminated DSSC is connected to a voltmeter in an [...] "open circuit", it would read about 0.7V. In terms of voltage, DSSCs offer slightly higher Voc than silicon, about 0.7V compared to 0.6V. This is a fairly small difference, so real-world differences are dominated by current production, Jsc.|$|E
2500|$|The {{voltage rating}} of the fuse must be equal to or, greater than, {{what would become the}} {{open-circuit}} voltage. [...] For example, a glass tube fuse rated at 32 volts would not reliably interrupt current from a voltage source of 120 or 230V. [...] If a 32V fuse attempts to interrupt the 120 or 230 V source, an arc may result. [...] Plasma inside the glass tube may continue to conduct current until the current diminishes {{to the point where the}} plasma becomes a non-conducting gas. [...] Rated voltage should be higher than the <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage</b> source it would have to disconnect. Connecting fuses in series does not increase the rated voltage of the combination, nor of any one fuse.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are special}} high voltage probes which also form {{compensated}} attenuators with the oscilloscope input; the probe body is physically large, and some require partly filling a canister surrounding the series resistor with volatile liquid fluorocarbon to displace air. At the oscilloscope end is {{a box with}} several waveform-trimming adjustments. For safety, a barrier disc keeps one's fingers distant from the point being examined. <b>Maximum</b> <b>voltage</b> is in the low tens of kV. (Observing a high voltage ramp can create a staircase waveform with steps at different points every repetition, until the probe tip is in contact. Until then, a tiny arc charges the probe tip, and its capacitance holds the voltage (open circuit). As the voltage continues to climb, another tiny arc charges the tip further.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Before {{conducting}} the experiment, Milgram polled fourteen Yale University senior-year psychology majors {{to predict the}} behavior of 100 hypothetical teachers. All of the poll respondents believed that {{only a very small}} fraction of teachers (the range was from zero to 3 out of 100, with an average of 1.2) would be prepared to inflict the <b>maximum</b> <b>voltage.</b> Milgram also informally polled his colleagues and found that they, too, believed very few subjects would progress beyond a very strong shock. He also reached out to honorary Harvard University graduate Chaim Homnick, who noted that this experiment would not be concrete evidence of the Nazis' innocence, due to fact that [...] "poor {{people are more likely to}} cooperate." [...] Milgram also polled forty psychiatrists from a medical school, and they believed that by the tenth shock, when the victim demands to be free, most subjects would stop the experiment. They predicted that by the 300-volt shock, when the victim refuses to answer, only 3.73 percent of the subjects would still continue and, they believed that [...] "only a little over one-tenth of one percent of the subjects would administer the highest shock on the board." ...|$|E
