2500|$|On 12 August, Morsi asked Mohamad Hussein Tantawi, {{head of the}} country's armed forces, and Sami Anan, the Army {{chief of}} staff, to resign and Morsi assumed {{legislative}} powers. Morsi's spokesman, Yasser Ali, announced that both Tantawi and Anan would remain advisers to the president. Tantawi and Anan were kept on as [...] "special counsels to the president" [...] with undisclosed roles and were given Egypt's highest state honour, the Grand Collar of the Nile. Morsi named Abdul Fatah al-Sisi, currently serving as chief of military intelligence, as Egypt's new defense minister. He also replaced Egypt Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Sami Hafez Anan with General Sedki Sobhi. General Mohamed al-Assar, {{a member of the}} Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, was named an assistant defense minister. Morsi also pushed out the chiefs of the navy, the air force and the air defense branch of Egypt armed forces. More specifically Vice Admiral Mohab Mamish, Commander of the Egyptian Navy; Lieutenant General Abd El Aziz Seif-Eldeen, Commander of the Egyptian Air Defense Forces; and Air Marshal Reda Mahmoud Hafez, Commander of the Egyptian Air Force were relieved from duty and moved on to civilian roles. Morsi said his decisions had not been intended to humiliate military. [...] "I never meant to antagonize anyone," [...] Morsi said. [...] "We go on to new horizons, with new generations, with new blood that has long been awaited." [...] "I want the armed forces to devote themselves to a mission that is holy to all of us, which is protecting the nation," [...] he said in a televised address. [...] "The decisions I took today were not meant ever to target certain persons, nor did I intend to embarrass institutions, nor was <b>my</b> <b>aim</b> to narrow freedoms," [...] he said. [...] "I did not mean to send a negative message about anyone, but <b>my</b> <b>aim</b> was the benefit of this nation and its people." [...] Morsi also announced that the constitutional amendments passed by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) [...] that had gutted the authority of his office, and replaced it with his own declaration, one that gave him broad legislative and executive powers and a decisive role in the drafting of Egypt’s still unfinished new constitution. In addition Morsi appointed a senior judge and Muslim Brotherhood favorite, Mahmoud Mekki, as his vice president. The new constitutional decree Morsy released is made up of just four articles. Among the powers Morsi assumed are the power to select a new panel to write Egypt’s constitution, if the current panel could finish its work, and the full power to author, approve, and promulgate legislation. This marked the [...] "completion of Egyptian revolution," [...] said an unidentified spokesman according to the Jerualem Post. The New York Times described the move as an [...] "upheaval" [...] and a [...] "stunning purge", given the power that SCAF had taken after the fall of Mubarak. Morsi's moves triggered support for and protest against his 12 August decisions, while legal experts questioned legitimacy of Morsi's constitutional changes and conflicting reports emerged from military officials over whether Morsi consulted with the armed forces regarding his decision to retire Tantawi and Anan. Al Jazeera described it as [...] "escalating the power struggle" [...] between the president and military.|$|E

He had {{suggested}} to Master Lyallpuri that Akali should start one of their own English newspaper so that the Akal agenda and voice could reach every nook and corner of India. Accordingly, the 'Managing Board' of The Akali newspaper held a meeting under chairmanship of Lyallpuri and decided to found an English daily. The Board assigned the task to Master Lyallpuri and S Mangal Singh Gill. However, the move received a setback when Lyallpuri was arrested under section 124 'O' for writing what the English Government thought was objectionable material in The Akali. On release from jail, Lyallpuri resumed the efforts and put an advertisement in The Akali asking for donations for five Lakhs from Sikh Sangat. In response, the Punjabi fans of Master Lyallpuri from Stockton (USA) immediately wired Rs 150,000. Another Rs 70,000 was contributed by local Sikh community with the efforts of Lyallpuri. S Mangal Singh Gill and Chanchal Singh (Jandiala, Jullundur) were made in charge of the newspaper. Pt Madan Mohan Malaviya and Master Tara Singh were members of the Managing Committee. K. S. Panikar was its first Editor. Devdas Gandhi was also on the editor's panel. The Managing chairman and Chief Patron was Master Lyallpuri himself. The opening ceremony was performed by Mahatma Gandhi on 15 September 1924. The first issue was published from Naya Bazar, Delhi [...] (Now: Swami Sharda Nand Marag). It was very unfortunate for the Sikhs that due to lack of experience, and jealousy and betrayal of the fellows like Master Tara Singh and S.
