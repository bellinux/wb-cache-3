5|$|Aside from Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, <b>master</b> gunnery {{sergeant}} (MGySgt) and {{sergeant major}} {{are the highest}} enlisted ranks in the Marine Corps; however, there are far fewer <b>master</b> gunnery sergeants than sergeants major.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, players are given an introductory level and boss to overcome. Afterward, they are given access to eight different stages, each representing one of the above-mentioned Robot Masters.

If Mega Man defeats the Robot <b>Master</b> using his primary weapon, the Robot <b>Master</b> will be captured and reprogrammed. This allows players to play through stages as one of the Robot Masters.|$|E
5|$|Benbow {{continued}} {{aboard the}} Sovereign throughout 1691, {{and by the}} summer of 1692, was again <b>master</b> of the fleet, this time under Admiral Edward Russell, then aboard the Britannia.

After the defeat, a Royal Commission was held into the circumstances that led to it.

He did not however testify during Torrington's court-martial in December that year.|$|E
