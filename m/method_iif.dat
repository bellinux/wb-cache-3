Investigations were conducted on a total of 181 cows originating from three different dairy farms. Blood and cervical mucus samples for laboratory analyses were collected on the day of the last artificial insemination. Presence of ASA was determined by indirect immunofluorescence <b>method</b> (<b>IIF)</b> using bulls' sperm cells prepared for artificial insemination by suspending in TRIS - egg yolk or "Biociphos + " extenders prior to deep freezing. Our results strongly confirm the hypothesis that immune mechanisms may be involved in reproductive disturbances due to high levels of ASA of lg A class. In the sera and cervical mucus of cows, high levels of ASA were found in animals with longer open days period.

40|$|AbstractHigh order spatial {{derivatives}} {{and stiff}} reactions often introduce severe temporal stability {{constraints on the}} time step in numerical methods. Implicit integration <b>method</b> (<b>IIF)</b> method, which treats diffusion exactly and reaction implicitly, provides excellent stability properties with good efficiency by decoupling the treatment of reactions and diffusions. One major challenge for IIF is storage and calculation of the potential dense exponential matrices of the sparse discretization matrices resulted from the linear differential operators. Motivated by a compact representation for IIF (cIIF) for Laplacian operators in two and three dimensions, we introduce an array-representation technique for efficient handling of exponential matrices from a general linear differential operator that may include cross-derivatives and non-constant diffusion coefficients. In this approach, exponentials are only needed for matrices of small size that depend only {{on the order of}} derivatives and number of discretization points, independent of the size of spatial dimensions. This method is particularly advantageous for high-dimensional systems, and it can be easily incorporated with IIF to preserve the excellent stability of IIF. Implementation and direct simulations of the array-representation compact IIF (AcIIF) on systems, such as Fokker–Planck equations in three and four dimensions and chemical master equations, in addition to reaction–diffusion equations, show efficiency, accuracy, and robustness of the new method. Such array-presentation based on methods may have broad applications for simulating other complex systems involving high-dimensional data...|$|E

The Krylov implicit integration factor method is robust in its implementation with various spatial discretization methods such as FDM, FVM, and DG methods. It also adapts to different mesh generation including triangular and quadrilateral mesh. However, at each time step the Krylov subspace method needs to be carried out at each time step, leading to a significant increase in CPU time.|$|R

The performance of two automated multi-parametric assays [Aklides (Medipan/Generic Assays) and EuroPattern (Euroimmun) ] combining IIF on cellular and purified antigen substrates was compared with two manual IIF analyses and with commercially available ELISAs for MPO- and PR 3 -ANCA Euroimmun).

40|$|Adrenocortical autoantibodies (ACA), {{present in}} 60 - 80 % of {{patients}} with idiopathic Addison's disease, are conventionally detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on frozen sections of adrenal glands. The large-scale use of IIF is limited {{in part by the}} need for a fluorescence microscope and the fact that histological sections cannot be stored for long periods of time. To circumvent these restrictions we developed a novel peroxidase-labelled protein A (PLPA) technique for the detection of ACA in patients with Addison's disease and compared the results with those obtained with the classical IIF assay. We studied serum samples from 90 healthy control subjects and 22 patients with Addison's disease, who had been clinically classified into two groups: idiopathic (N = 13) and granulomatous (N = 9). ACA-PLPA were detected in 10 / 22 (45 %) patients: 9 / 13 (69 %) with the idiopathic form and 1 / 9 (11 %) with the granulomatous form, whereas ACA-IIF were detected in 11 / 22 patients (50 %) : 10 / 13 (77 %) with the idiopathic form and 1 / 9 (11 %) with the granulomatous form. Twelve of the 13 idiopathic addisonians (92 %) were positive for either ACA-PLPA or ACA-IIF, but only 7 were positive by both methods.

30|$|The {{other type}} of {{approach}} to avoid storage of the exponentials of matrices is a compact implicit integration factor (cIIF) method [11].

Recently, based on the idea of cIIF method, an array-representation compact implicit integration (AcIIF) method [16] was proposed for efficient handling of a general linear differential operator that includes cross-derivatives and non-constant diffusion coefficients. Despite the various advantages and tremendous success, the cIIF method has its own shortcomings.

Previous researches only provided simple segmentation methods and criterions for cell segmentation and recognition, but a fully automatic framework for the segmentation and recognition of HEp- 2 cells had never been reported before. This study proposes a method based on the watershed algorithm to automatically detect the HEp- 2 cells with different patterns. The experimental results show that the segmentation performance of the proposed method is satisfactory when evaluated with percent volume overlap (PVO: 89 %). The classification performance using a SVM classifier designed based on the features calculated from the segmented cells achieves an average accuracy of 96. 90 %, which outperforms other methods presented in previous studies. The proposed method can be used to develop a computer-aided system to assist the physicians in the diagnosis of auto-immune diseases...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the diagnostic utilities of the automated connective tissues disease screening assay, CTD screen, in patients with systemic rheumatic diseases. A total of 1093 serum samples were assayed using CTD screen and indirect immunofluorescent (<b>IIF)</b> <b>methods.</b> Among them, 162 were diagnosed with systemic rheumatic disease, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and {{mixed connective tissue disease}} (MCT). The remaining 931 with non-systemic rheumatic disease were assigned to the control group. The median ratios of CTD screen tests were significantly higher in the systemic rheumatic disease group than in the control group. The positive likelihood ratios of the CTD screen were higher than those of IIF in patients with total rheumatic diseases (4. 1 vs. 1. 6), including SLE (24. 3 vs. 10. 7). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC-AUCs) of the CTD screen for discriminating total rheumatic diseases, RA, SLE, and MCT from controls were 0. 68, 0. 56, 0. 92 and 0. 80, respectively. The ROC-AUCs of the combinations with IIF were significantly higher in patients with total rheumatic diseases (0. 72) and MCT (0. 85) than in those of the CTD screen alone. Multivariate analysis indicated that both the CTD screen and IIF were independent variables for predicting systemic rheumatic disease. CTD screen alone and in combination with IIF were a valuable diagnostic tool for predicting systemic rheumatic diseases, particularly for SLE...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{subclass}} distribution of autoantibodies and their complement-fixing capacity in cicatricial pemphigoid (CP) and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) we studied the sera from 23 patients by both indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on 4 -μm cryostat sections of normal human skin and immunoblotting of epidermal or dermal extracts. Monoclonal antibodies of strict specificity for human IgG subclasses were used. Sera from 20 patients with BP served as controls. In addition, total IgG subclass levels {{were determined by}} indirect competitive ELISA in all sera. Complement binding capacity was studied by IIF using antibodies to C 3 after incubation of skin section with autoantibodies and source of fresh complement. CP autoantibodies reacting with the 230 - 240 kD and/or the 180 -kD epidermal bands showed an IgG 4 /IgG 1 subclass restriction, with a predominance of IgG 4 in 10 cases, of IgG 1 in four. In BP sera, IgG 4 and IgG 1 autoantibodies were detected with a similar frequency (100 % and 83 %, respectively). In EBA sera, autoantibodics reacting with the 290 kD and 145 kD dermal bands also showed an IgG 1 /IgG 4 restriction. Concordant results were obtained by IIF. However, the <b>IIF</b> <b>method</b> had a lower sensitivity {{for the detection of}} IgG 4 CP antibodies and IgG 1 EBA antibodies than immunoblotting. Finally, when CP antibodies were analyzed for their complement-binding activity, it was found that sera containing IgG 4 autoantibodies alone never fixed complement whereas all complement-fixing CP sera had IgG 1 autoantibodies, suggesting that only this subclass of antibodies is capable of fixing complement...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{assess the}} {{diagnostic}} value for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), of an immunoblotting assay {{based on the}} rat oesophagus epithelium antigens recognised by the so-called 'antikeratin antibodies' ('AKA'), antigens that {{have been identified as}} three non-cytokeratin proteins (referred to as A, B and C proteins). METHODS [...] After polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in non-denaturing conditions and electrotransfer of an epithelial extract, the immunoreactivities to the A, B and C proteins of a series of serum samples from 88 patients with RA and 100 patients with non-rheumatoid rheumatic diseases, were semiquantitatively evaluated. RESULTS [...] A total of 81. 8 % of RA serum samples recognised the three proteins, while 91 % of non-RA serum samples only weakly recognised the A and B proteins but not the C protein. Only in the group of RA patients, were the titres of the antibodies to the A, B and C proteins found to be significantly correlated {{with each other and with}} the titres of 'AKA' detected by the standard indirect immunofluorescence (<b>IIF)</b> <b>method.</b> For a diagnostic specificity of 99 %, the diagnostic sensitivities of the detection of the A and B proteins were 50 % and 43. 2 %, respectively, when those of the detection of 'AKA' by IIF and of IgM-rheumatoid factor by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were 42 % and 54 %, respectively. In contrast, at a same specificity of 99 %, the diagnostic sensitivity of the detection of the C protein was significantly higher with a value of 70. 5 %. CONCLUSION [...] This immunoblotting assay which is the first immunochemical method proposed for the detection of 'AKA, should be validated on larger series of patients but can already be considered as a very powerful test for the serological diagnosis of RA...|$|R
40|$|Serum anti-mitochondrial {{antibodies}} (AMA) are the serological {{hallmark of}} primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), yet up to 15 % of PBC sera are AMA negative at routine indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) while being {{referred to as}} "probable" cases. The diagnostic role of PBC-specific antinuclear antibodies (ANA) remains to be determined. We will report herein data on the accuracy of new laboratory tools for AMA and PBC-specific ANA in a large series of PBC sera that were AMA-negative at IIF. We will also provide {{a discussion of the}} history and current status of AMA detection <b>methods.</b> We included <b>IIF</b> AMA-negative PBC sera (n= 100) and sera from patients with other chronic liver diseases (n= 104) that had been independently tested for IIF AMA and ANA; sera were blindly tested with an ELISA PBC screening test including two ANA (gp 210, sp 100) and a triple (pMIT 3) AMA recombinant antigens. Among IIF AMA-negative sera, 43 / 100 (43 %) manifested reactivity using the PBC screening test. The same test was positive for 6 / 104 (5. 8 %) control sera. IIF AMA-negative/PBC screen-positive sera reacted against pMIT 3 (11 / 43), gp 210 (8 / 43), Sp 100 (17 / 43), both pMIT 3 and gp 210 (1 / 43), or both pMIT 3 and Sp 100 (6 / 43). Concordance rates between the ANA pattern on HEp- 2 cells and specific Sp 100 and gp 210 ELISA results in AMA-negative subjects were 92 % for nuclear dots and Sp 100 and 99 % for nuclear rim and gp 210. Our data confirm the hypothesis that a substantial part of IIF AMA-negative (formerly coined "probable") PBC cases manifest disease-specific autoantibodies when tested using newly available tools and thus overcome the previously suggested diagnostic classification. As suggested by the recent literature, we are convinced that the proportion of AMA-negative PBC cases will be significantly minimized by the use of new laboratory methods and recombinant antigen...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in serum is the hallmark diagnostic test for most Systemic Autoimmune Rheumatic Disease (SARD). Anti-dense fine speckled (DFS) 70 is an autoantibody {{that produces a}} characteristic dense fine speckled pattern in the ANA HEp- 2 indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assay. Its clinical significance {{is not yet clear}} however {{it has been reported that}} these antibodies are more prevalent in healthy individuals and non-SARD patients than in SARD patients. Thus it is has been proposed that the {{presence of}} anti-DFS 70 antibodies could be used to eliminate a SARD diagnosis. To date, there is no published data as to whether this can be applied to a New Zealand population, nor what the prevalence of these antibodies are in a New Zealand population. The DFS IIF pattern can be difficult to identify and most New Zealand diagnostic laboratories do not specifically test for the autoantibody, therefore it is likely that its presence is currently being under-reported. The purpose of this research was to determine if New Zealand diagnostic laboratories should be specifically testing for anti-DFS 70 antibodies and including the result in the laboratory report. Thus the principal objectives of this research were to (1) determine if current routine ANA testing methods are detecting anti-DFS 70 antibodies, (2) determine the local prevalence of anti-DFS 70 in ANA positive patients in a New Zealand public hospital population, (3) determine if the presence of anti-DFS 70 is clinically significant in terms of a SARD diagnosis. Should anti-DFS 70 prove to be a significant factor in terms of eliminating a SARD diagnosis, then a new ANA diagnostic algorithm would be proposed. Samples tested were a consecutive series of routine ANA positive patient samples at a general public hospital, consisting of 100 each of SARD and non-SARD patients. In order to ensure the likelihood of anti-DFS 70 detection, two ANA detection <b>methods</b> were used (<b>IIF</b> and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)). All positive ANA samples were tested for anti-DFS 70 by chemiluminescence immunoassay (CIA). Results showed that both the ANA IIF and ELISA assays are detecting anti-DFS 70 antibodies. The prevalence of anti-DFS antibodies in SARD patients was 1 % and in non-SARD patients was 7 % and the difference between the two was statistically significant. In non-SARD patients anti-DFS 70 was usually found in isolation with no other specific ANAs present. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of anti-DFS 70 according to ethnicity but not by age or sex. In conclusion, the presence of anti-DFS 70 antibodies, particularly when present alone without any other specific ANAs present, makes a SARD diagnosis highly unlikely. Therefore New Zealand diagnostic laboratories should be specifically testing for anti-DFS 70 antibodies and including the result in the laboratory report. An appropriate interpretative comment should be included in the report as it is imperative that clinicians are aware of the significance of the anti-DFS 70 result...|$|R
40|$|Background: Immunity status, {{individual}} {{response to}} disease {{and types of}} antibodies produced are well known to vary from person to person, place to place and probably from population to population. A broad spectrum of specific auto antibodies that have so far been associated with specific rheumatic diseases, as noted in Western literature, has been well taken as a reference standard all over the world. There is neither research work nor any data correlating the auto antibodies and their antinuclear antibody (ANA) patterns with the immunoprofile in the Indian population to date. Aims: To understand a definite association between ANA patterns and specific antibodies in the serum in the Indian study population and to document similarities / differences with the West. Settings and Design: This prospective and retrospective double blind study was undertaken on the South Indian population referred for ANA testing by Indirect Immunofluorescence method and by immunoline methods. Materials and Methods: Serum samples of patients from a random South Indian population who sought medical help for rheumatic disease were subjected for ANA testing by indirect immunofluorescence (<b>IIF)</b> <b>method</b> and line immunoassay {{during the study period}} of 27 months. Serum samples were processed in dilution of 1 : 100 using HEp - 2010 / liver biochip (Monkey) (EUROIMMUN AG). The serum samples which were further processed for line immunoassay were treated in 1 : 100 dilution on nylon strips coated with recombinant and purified antigens as discrete lines with plastic backing (EUROIMMUN AG) coated with antigens nRNP / Sm, Sm, SSA, Ro- 52, SSB, Scl- 70, PM-Scl, PCNA, Jo- 1, CENP-B, dsDNA, nucleosomes, histones, ribosomal protein-P, anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA-M 2) along with a control band. The analysis was done by comparing the intensity of the reaction with positive control line by image analysis. Results: The antinuclear antibody indirect immunofluorescence (ANA - IIF) patterns obtained were projectable to visualize a certain spectrum of specific antibodies such as homogenous (45. 5 &#x 0025;) with dsDNA, nucleosomes, histones, SSA / Ro- 52, RIB and RNP / Sm, speckled pattern (35. 6 &#x 0025;) with Sm, RNP, SSA/Ro- 52, SSB, Sm and RIB; nucleolar pattern with Scl- 70, Sm, RNP and centromere pattern with CENP-B. The methodology indicated that, cytoplasmic pattern noted in ANA also needs to be correlated with primate liver in a biochip, which should prompt further decision for a request for line immunoassay and it is preferable for two pathologists to report independently and sign out a consensus ANA report for better predictive value. Conclusions: As a definite correlation between the ANA patterns and the group of antibodies was detected by line immunoassay, one could predict presence of certain specific auto antibodies for a particular ANA pattern identified. This may restrict one from requesting for line immunoassay, which is expensive and economizes on the cost of laboratory investigations in a developing country like India. Thus, screening of sera by ANA-IIF method alone may suffice and probably reduce the expense of detailed immunological work-up with minimal loss in diagnostic accuracy.
