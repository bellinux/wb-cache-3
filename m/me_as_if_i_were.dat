25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, {{and the sound of}} their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{outside the}} Pearl, Eko sees Yemi and follows {{him into an}} open field, where Yemi tells him {{it is time for}} Eko to confess his sins. Eko says he has not sinned, having not chosen the life he was given and that Eko had only done what he needed to do to survive. An angry-looking Yemi replies, [...] "You speak to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> your brother" [...] as he retreats into the jungle. Eko follows him asking [...] "Who are you?!", and then finds the smoke monster. An arm of smoke attacks Eko, beating him into trees before he is slammed into the ground. Locke and the others rush out of the station to find a bloodied Eko. Locke {{approaches}} Eko, who whispers his dying words into Locke's ears. Sayid asks what he said, and Locke replies, [...] "We're next." ...|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people would look at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I {{began to think that}} maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I {{was in a position to}} know him. I regret that I had not a chance to know him better." ...|$|E
60|$|She started, {{and drew}} back from <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had struck {{her with a}} sudden terror.|$|R
60|$|My lady {{stared at}} <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> knew. And I didn't know. And that perplexed me afresh.|$|R
60|$|NORA. You little know Peter Keegan. He'd {{see through}} <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was a pane o glass.|$|R
2500|$|In 1954, after a {{show at the}} Copacabana with Sammy Davis Jr., Richard Nixon and {{his wife}} Pat stopped by. [...] Afterwards the then Vice President {{made his way to}} the {{dressing}} rooms to thank them for the show. [...] The papers noted Mary as saying They applauded <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> a Republican! ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1972 {{she began}} running Pepsi Cola's {{national}} mobile tennis project, which brought portable nets {{and other equipment}} to underprivileged areas in major cities. [...] She ran multiple other clinics and tennis outreach programs {{over the next three}} decades, and coached numerous rising competitors, including Leslie Allen and Zina Garrison. [...] "She pushed <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> a pro, not a junior," [...] wrote Garrison in her 2001 memoir. [...] "I owe the opportunity I received to her." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} published in ABC Film Review in November 1964, Cushing stated, [...] "People look at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{some sort of}} monster, but I can't think why. In my macabre pictures, I have either been a monster-maker or a monster-destroyer, but never a monster. Actually, I'm a gentle fellow. Never harmed a fly. I love animals, and when I'm in the country I'm a keen bird-watcher." [...] In {{an interview}} published in 1966, he added, [...] "I do get terribly tired with the neighbourhood kids telling me 'My mum says she wouldn't want to meet you in a dark alley'." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{compressed}} {{her lips}} with an angry glance at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{could help her}} wrinkles, then she sighed.|$|R
60|$|DAISY. She doesn't {{approve of}} my being alone with strange gentlemen. She looks after <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was a child of ten.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gracious <b>me!</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't {{trust you}} with {{millions}} of billions <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had them," [...] cried Rose, scandalised at the mere suggestion.|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS. Then {{get out of}} my way; for I won't {{stop for}} you. You talk about <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> a motor bus.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{have you}} been dodging round corners to avoid <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> a dun, and inventing the feeblest excuses not to come to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, doctor," [...] replied Mrs Stoutley, {{with a faint}} smile; [...] "you talk of <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{a bottle}} of physic or flat ginger-beer." ...|$|E
60|$|ROSE. I suppose so, else he wouldn't treat <b>me</b> <b>as</b> he's done. He's after that--that--He didn't {{ought to}} treat <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "They're true. You know they're true!" [...] {{the girl}} passionately retorted. [...] "You all treat <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{had no more}} soul than a telephone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Confound {{the little}} termagant!" [...] broke out Harry. [...] "What does she mean by being so pert to me? She treats <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was a fool!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Maggie, I can't {{give you}} up,--unless you are deceiving me; unless you really only care for <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> your brother. Tell me the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, sir! {{think of}} other subjects, and speak of other things, {{and in another}} strain. Don't address <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> a beauty; I am your plain, Quakerish governess." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not that I'm really sick. Mrs. Meeker, like yourself, {{persists}} in treating <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were.</b> I'm feeling fine--perfectly well, only I'm not as rugged as I want to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Upon my word,” he said, {{recovering}} {{his usual}} bearing. “It looks to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{had been asked}} there only for the daughter to talk to me.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell {{him to give}} it to her--he knows who--and--and--say it {{has kept}} me in--in heaven when {{sometimes}} it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had got into hell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{business}} is soon told," [...] said the man. [...] "I am a king's messenger, and this lady has treated <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was a baron-bailie's officer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed I will! Speak to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> little Meg again. I {{often feel}} as if I needed {{teaching}} more than ever since these babies look to me for everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] she said, as {{she burst into}} tears and took the girl into her arms, [...] "it does seem to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> your own mother!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And who are you, that orders <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> a dog?" [...] {{fiercely}} returned Sommers, who, {{since the}} day of the unsuccessful mutiny, had again become desperate, and was in consequence heavily ironed.|$|E
6000|$|... "We?" [...] I snarled at her. [...] "We?" [...] I {{repeated}} {{still more}} fiercely, and drove her back before <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had done her a bodily hurt.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} not. Mrs. Lyddell will never treat <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was at home, and I am afraid {{there is an}} honourable man that I must be {{bestowed}} on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{give you}} my word, that will be as strong a bond to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> laid {{my hand on the}} Bible. I don't require that to bind me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do talk to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> one," [...] said Lord Warburton. [...] "I don't see how {{you manage}} to get on without potatoes; you must find so few things to eat over here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On {{that subject}} I will not listen. I have felt very sore and angry ever since {{you told me}} last night {{to leave the room}} when Sholto insulted <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> the aggressor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am at my best, at my strongest,' he {{said proudly}} to himself. 'She {{ought to be}} rejoiced at me, but she is not; she rejects <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> a baboon under my clothing.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's {{all these}} fancy dogs ever have {{the matter with}} them. It looks to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> might do {{business}} with this man. I'll get his address from Mitchell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{what you}} say is <b>as</b> natural to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> felt it," [...] said Dale. [...] "I wondered. You're {{certainly}} full of fire, An', Helen, what do you say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, dear. Only, {{when you}} ask <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> mightn't perhaps know what to think, {{it seems to me}} best to let you see that I know {{perfectly}} what to think." ...|$|R
