5|$|However, Black {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion in Korematsu v. United States, which upheld Japanese internment during World War II. Black also consistently opposed the doctrine of substantive due process (the anti-New Deal Supreme Court's interpretation of this concept <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the government to enact legislation that interfered with the freedom of business owners) and believed {{that there was no}} basis {{in the words of the}} Constitution for a right to privacy, voting against finding one in Griswold v.

5|$|Shackleton {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} on 5 January 1922, while Quest was {{anchored}} at South Georgia. After his death the original programme, which had included an exploration of Enderby Land, was abandoned. Wild led a brief cruise which brought them into sight of Elephant Island. They anchored off Cape Wild, and were able to see the old landmarks, but sea conditions <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> them to land.|$|E
5|$|The Anzac Mounted Division's {{lines of}} {{communication}} were now fully extended, and the difficulties of supplying the mounted troops from Romani <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the British Empire mounted force to consider any further advance at that time. Arrangements were made to hold and garrison the country decisively won by this series of indecisive engagements, from Katia eastwards to Bir El Abd.|$|E

5|$|The couple then {{journeyed to}} Claremont in Surrey for the honeymoon, but the {{presence}} of attendants on the journey, and at meal times, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> them to talk privately. The short four-day visit did not pass without an interruption from the Queen, who was curious about her daughter's thoughts on married life. Among their wedding gifts was a maplewood desk from Queen Victoria, now at Inveraray Castle.|$|E
5|$|This {{proposed}} recognition {{meant more}} to Floyd even than trade advantages and justice; {{it was another}} step in the disenthrallment of America. It would afford relief from that political plexus which had <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> one European nation to move, even in matters relating to America, without creating a corresponding movement {{in each of the}} others. He was tired of negotiating the things which related exclusively to America in London, Paris, and Madrid.|$|E
5|$|Vestgrensa {{was part}} of Holmenkolbanen's {{operating}} network until 1975, when the municipality of Oslo bought all the company's stock. In the early 1990s, the stations on the Sognsvann Line were upgraded to metro standard, which involved a heightening and lengthening of the platforms, and installation of a third rail power supply and a new signaling system. The electrified third rail <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> passengers to cross at track level, and under- or overpasses had to be built at all stations.|$|E

5|$|Afghanistan did {{not send}} any {{delegation}} to the 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand, due to economic difficulties. Laws implemented by the Taliban government also <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> Afghan athletes to compete. For example, the International Boxing Association (AIBA) does not allow players to have beards and mustaches, but Afghan males were forbidden to cut their facial hair. Afghanistan returned to the Asian Games {{after the fall of}} the Taliban government in the midst of ongoing war. In June 2003, the IOC lifted the suspension imposed on Afghanistan during the 115th IOC Session in Prague.|$|E
5|$|Alcoholism {{and poor}} health afflicted Clark during his final years. In 1809 he {{suffered}} a severe stroke. When he fell into an operating fireplace, Clark suffered a burn on his right leg that was so severe {{it had to be}} amputated. The injury <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> Clark to continue to operate his mill and live independently. As a result, he moved to Locust Grove, a farm eight miles (13km) from the growing town of Louisville, and {{became a member of the}} household of his sister, Lucy, and brother-in-law, Major William Croghan, a planter.|$|E
5|$|Because he was {{credited}} with divine power himself, the pharaoh, as a sacred king, was regarded as Egypt's representative to the gods and its most important upholder of maat. Thus, it was theoretically his duty to perform the temple rites. While it is uncertain how often he participated in ceremonies, the existence of temples across Egypt <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> {{him to do so}} in all cases, {{and most of the time}} these duties were delegated to priests. The pharaoh was nevertheless obligated to maintain, provide for, and expand the temples throughout his realm.|$|E

5|$|Because the big {{gap between}} the ROK Capital and ROK 8th Divisions <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> ROK I Corps at Kyongju to direct {{the action of the}} 8th Division, the ROK Army {{transferred}} that division to the control of the ROK II Corps on September 7, and attached to it the ROK 5th Regiment of the ROK 7th Division. This shift of command came just as the NK 15th Division penetrated the ROK 8th Division lines to enter Yongch'on in the Taegu-P'ohang-dong corridor. From west of An'gang-ni the ROK 3rd Regiment drove toward Yongch'on, attempting to close the gap.|$|E
5|$|Cannae {{played a}} major role in shaping the {{military}} structure and tactical organization of the Roman Republican army. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed a formation similar to the Greek phalanx. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal's tactic of double envelopment since their inability to maneuver independently from the mass of the army <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> them to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.|$|E
5|$|Giron and Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz {{claimed that}} the recall defeat was due to voter {{suppression}}. The Denver Post disputed this, saying that the result wasn't caused by voter suppression {{but the fact that}} more people showed up to vote against Giron than to vote for her. Gessler said that the Democrats fared worse where more people turned out. Wasserman Schultz also stated that the money spent by the NRA and the Koch brothers <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> Democrats to win.|$|E
50|$|In early September, Swick {{stated that}} he had been mis-diagnosed with a stomach disease.

50|$|The Indonesian {{reaction}} was anticipated: Police officers {{arrived at the}} scene and apprehended Dr. Thom and other West Papuan political leaders; they were arrested and taken to military headquarters for interrogations.

5|$|In New York City, {{more than}} 90% {{of the workers}} and {{visitors}} {{who died in the}} towers had been at or above the points of impact. In the North Tower, 1,355 people at or above the point of impact were trapped and died of smoke inhalation, fell or jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames, or were killed in the building's eventual collapse. The destruction of all three staircases in the tower when Flight 11 hit <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> anyone above the impact zone to escape. 107 people below the point of impact died as well.|$|E
5|$|Operation Banner {{ended at}} midnight on 31 July 2007 after about 38 years of {{continuous}} deployment, the longest in British Army history. According {{to an internal}} document released in 2007, the British Army had failed to defeat the IRA but <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> them to win by violence. Operation Helvetic replaced Operation Banner in 2007, maintaining fewer service personnel in a more-benign environment. From 1971 to 1997, a total of 763 British military personnel were killed during the Troubles. About 300 deaths during the conflict were attributed to the British Army, including paramilitary troops and civilians.|$|E
5|$|Until 1954, the Scotland {{team was}} managed by a SFA {{selection}} committee. The role of manager was first established in May 1954 with {{the appointment of}} Andy Beattie, who took charge on a part-time basis while continuing as manager of Huddersfield Town. Beattie took the team to the 1954 FIFA World Cup, but the SFA only allowed him to select a travelling party of 13 players. Beattie, who felt this restriction <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> him to perform his duties well, resigned during the tournament. Scotland were eliminated from the tournament after a 7–0 defeat by Uruguay.|$|E

50|$|Fired: Dayana Mendoza - {{for lack}} of leadership, being unable to control her {{teammates}} and subsequently losing their respect, failing as a project manager for the second time.

5|$|At {{the time}} of Men in Black: Alien Attacks development, Universal Creative were {{installing}} two new dark ride systems at the neighbouring Islands of Adventure theme park. The first system was designed for The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man and was manufactured by Oceaneering International. It featured track-mounted motion bases with {{six degrees of freedom}} that were able to tour physical sets and allow riders to view 3D projections. The second system was developed by MTS Systems Corporation for The Cat in the Hat. This system was simpler, offering track-mounted spinning platforms, with no additional degrees of freedom. The MIB design team initially intended to utilise the Spider-Man ride system; however, when shooting tests were performed on the ride, the vast motion of the vehicles <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> riders to achieve a reasonable score. As a result, The Cat in the Hat system was selected for the MIB attraction.|$|E
5|$|By 19:30, the High Seas Fleet, {{which was}} {{by that point}} {{pursuing}} the British battlecruisers, had not yet encountered the Grand Fleet. Scheer had been considering retiring his forces before darkness exposed his ships to torpedo boat attack. He had not yet made a decision when his leading battleships encountered {{the main body of}} the Grand Fleet. This development <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> Scheer to retreat, for doing so would have sacrificed the slower pre-dreadnought battleships of the II Battle Squadron, while using his dreadnoughts and battlecruisers to cover their retreat would have subjected his strongest ships to overwhelming British fire. Instead, Scheer ordered his ships to turn 16 points to starboard, which would bring the pre-dreadnoughts to the relative safety of the disengaged side of the German battle line.|$|E
5|$|In Scotland, {{the power}} of the Protestant Lords of the Congregation was rising at the expense of Mary's mother, who {{maintained}} effective control only through the use of French troops. The Protestant Lords invited English troops into Scotland in an attempt to secure Protestantism, and a Huguenot rising in France, called the Tumult of Amboise, in March 1560 <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the French to send further support. Instead, the Guise brothers sent ambassadors to negotiate a settlement. On 11 June 1560, their sister (Mary's mother) died, and so the question of future Franco-Scots relations was a pressing one. Under the terms of the Treaty of Edinburgh, signed by Mary's representatives on 6 July 1560, France and England undertook to withdraw troops from Scotland and France recognised Elizabeth's right to rule England. However, the seventeen-year-old Mary, still in France and grieving for her mother, refused to ratify the treaty.|$|E
