Rapid credit growth has been a recent feature of financial development in all countries under review and thus constitutes the main financial stability challenge. In general, monetary authorities have responded to these challenges by tightening monetary conditions and prudential standards, with concrete measures also reflecting the different monetary and exchange rate regimes in the region. Key words: risk, profitability, candidate countries, new <b>member’s</b> <b>states,</b> Over the last years, new <b>member</b> <b>states</b> (<b>Bulgaria</b> and Romania) and candidate countries (Croatia and Turkey) have seen strong economic growth, coupled with disinflation or low inflation.
