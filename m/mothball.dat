5|$|These four {{conditions}} closely {{mirror the}} original three conditions that the Nation Defense Authorization Act of 1996 {{laid out for}} the maintenance of Wisconsin while she was in the <b>Mothball</b> Fleet.

5|$|New Jersey was {{decommissioned}} for {{the last}} time in 1991 (after serving a total of 21 years in the active fleet), having earned a Navy Unit Commendation for service in Vietnam and 19 battle and campaign stars for combat operations during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Lebanese Civil War, and service in the Persian Gulf. After a brief retention in the <b>mothball</b> fleet, she was donated to the Home Port Alliance in Camden, New Jersey, and began her career as a museum ship 15 October 2001.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to repelling or killing insects such as moths and silverfish, <b>mothballs</b> {{have been suggested}} as a repellent to keep away mice, snakes, or other pests, however this is false. <b>Mothballs</b> do not repel snakes or mice. Small farmers have been passing on the ideology of <b>mothballs</b> acting as a repellent for snakes however this has been scientifically debunked numerous times. <b>Mothballs</b> not only do not keep snakes away but when used outdoors prove to be an enormous hazard including {{but not limited to}} poisoning of household pets, livestock, children, water and other aquatic animals. Recent issues with imported and unregulated <b>mothballs</b> from China have also become a huge concern as {{there is no way to}} know what chemicals were used during the process. <b>Mothballs</b> are to be used for storing clothing in a sealed container. Older-formula <b>mothballs</b> have also been used by drag racers to enhance the octane rating of fuel, by dissolving the <b>mothballs</b> in some of the fuel and filtering out the remains with a filter paper.|$|R
50|$|Some {{have claimed}} <b>mothballs</b> are {{ineffective}} as snake repellents or as rodent repellents. <b>Mothballs,</b> however, {{continue to be}} advertised as a squirrel repellent and are an ingredient in some commercial repellent products. They are generally ineffective {{as a deterrent to}} prevent squirrels from nesting in building interiors.|$|R

5|$|The Penrhyn Quarry {{is still}} {{producing}} slate, though {{at a much}} reduced capacity from its heyday {{at the end of}} the 19th century. In 1995, it accounted for almost 50% of UK production. It is currently owned and operated by Welsh Slate Ltd (a subsidiary of Lagan Building Solutions), which also owns and carries out some operations at the Oakeley quarry at Blaenau Ffestiniog, the Pen yr Orsedd quarry in the Nantlle Vale, and the Cwt-y-Bugail quarry. In March 2010 the company announced its decision to <b>mothball</b> the Oakeley quarry because of subsidence at the site.|$|E
5|$|Wichita {{was heavily}} engaged during the {{invasion}} of Okinawa, where she provided heavy gunfire support to ground troops ashore. After the Japanese surrender, the ship served {{as part of the}} occupation force in Japan and assisted in the repatriation of American military personnel under Operation Magic Carpet. After returning to the United States, she was decommissioned and placed in the <b>mothball</b> fleet in 1946. She remained in reserve until 1959, when she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and sold for scrapping in August 1959.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1991 Gulf War and the {{subsequent}} dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States Navy began to decommission and <b>mothball</b> many of the ships it had brought out of its reserve fleet in the drive to attain a 600-ship Navy. At the height of Navy Secretary John F. Lehman's 600-ship Navy plan, nearly 600ships of all types were active within the Navy. This included fifteen aircraft carriers, four battleships and over 100submarines, along with various other types of ships the overall plan specified. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 the Navy sought to return to its traditional, 313-ship composition. While reducing the fleet created under the 600-ship Navy program, {{the decision was made}} to deactivate the four recommissioned Iowa-class battleships and return them to the reserve fleet.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, the {{decommissioned}} battleships {{were removed}} from the Naval Vessel Register (NVR) after it was determined by ranking US Navy officials that there was no place for a battleship in the modern navy. In response to the striking of the battleships from the Naval Vessel Register a movement began to reinstate the battleships, on the grounds that these vessels had superior firepower over the then-existing 5-inch guns found on the , , and s, and s. Citing concern over the lack of available gunfire to support amphibious operations, Congress demanded that the United States Navy reinstate two battleships to the naval vessel register and maintain them with the <b>mothball</b> fleet, until the Navy could certify it had gunfire support within the current fleet that would meet or exceed the battleship's capability.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the debate}} at large traces its roots {{back to the}} end of World War II, the current debate began in 1992 with the {{retirement}} of the last active Iowa-class battleship, , {{as a result of the}} reduced demand for naval artillery, the rise of ship and submarine-launched missiles and aircraft-launched precision guided munitions (such as laser-guided bombs, which can accurately strike and destroy an enemy target with a single strike). The most striking point of the debate in the United States centers on battleships: owing to the longtime maintenance and upkeep that the four completed Iowa-class battleships have undergone during their time in the navy's active and <b>mothball</b> fleets, many still view battleships as viable solutions for gunfire support, and these members have questioned if the navy can adequately replace the gunfire support provided by a battleship's main guns with the smaller guns on its current fleet of cruisers and destroyers.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 North Korea invaded South Korea, {{prompting}} the United States {{to intervene in}} the name of the United Nations. President Harry S. Truman was caught off guard when the invasion struck, but quickly ordered U.S. Forces stationed in Japan into South Korea. Truman also sent U.S. based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to Korea to support the Republic of Korea. As part of the naval mobilization New Jersey was recalled from the <b>mothball</b> fleet to provide seaborne artillery support for U.N. and South Korean troops. New Jersey was recommissioned at Bayonne on 21 November 1950, Captain David M. Tyree in command, and proceeded to the Caribbean, where she welded her crew into an efficient body which would meet the demanding requirements of the Korean War. She sailed from Norfolk, Virginia 16 April 1951 and arrived from Japan off the east coast of Korea 17 May. Vice Admiral Harold M. Martin, commanding the United States Seventh Fleet, placed his flag in New Jersey for the next six months.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mothballs</b> - Used {{primarily}} as a preservative but also will kill existing larvae if the concentration is high enough. There {{are two types of}} mothball: early twentieth century ones were often based on naphthalene, while mid twentieth century ones often used paradichlorobenzene. Both chemical crystals sublimate into a gas, which is heavier than air and needs to reach a high concentration around the protected material to be effective. Disadvantages: Vapors are toxic and carcinogenic; <b>mothballs</b> are poisonous and should not be put where they can be eaten by children or pets. Naphthalene <b>mothballs</b> are also highly flammable.|$|R

5|$|New Jersey {{remained}} in <b>mothball</b> fleet until the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act of 1999 {{passed through the}} United States Congress 18 October 1998. Section 1011 required the United States Secretary of the Navy to list and maintain Iowa and Wisconsin on the Naval Vessel Register, while Section 1012 required the Secretary of the Navy to strike New Jersey from the Naval Vessel Register and transfer the battleship to a not-for-profit entity in accordance with section 7306 of Title 10, United States Code. Section 1012 also required the transferee to locate the battleship in the State of New Jersey. The Navy made the switch in January 1999, and on 12 September, New Jersey was towed by the tug Sea Victory from Bremerton, Washington to Philadelphia, for restoration work in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in advance of her planned donation {{for use as a}} museum.|$|E

25|$|The {{remaining}} trace (<1% volume) compounds give flatus its smell. Historically, compounds such as indole, skatole, ammonia {{and short}} chain fatty acids {{were thought to}} cause the smell of flatus. More recent evidence proves that the major contribution to the smell of flatus comes {{from a combination of}} volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). It is known that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methyl mercaptan, MM (also known as methanethiol, MT), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) are present in flatus. The benzopyrrole volatiles indole and skatole have a <b>mothball</b> smell, and therefore probably do not contribute greatly to the characteristic smell of flatus.|$|E
25|$|Older mothballs {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} naphthalene, {{but due to}} naphthalene's flammability, many modern <b>mothball</b> formulations instead use 1,4-dichlorobenzene. The latter formulation may be somewhat less flammable, although both chemicals have the same NFPA 704 rating for flammability. The latter chemical is also variously labeled as para-dichlorobenzene, p-dichlorobenzene, pDCB, or PDB, making it harder to identify unless all these synonyms are known to a potential purchaser. Both of these formulations have the strong, pungent, sickly-sweet odor often associated with mothballs. Both naphthalene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene undergo sublimation, meaning that they evaporate from a solid state directly into a gas; this gas is toxic to moths and moth larvae.|$|E
25|$|The {{coal trade}} from Penarth docks {{eventually}} petered {{out and the}} docks closed in 1936, only reopening for commercial and military use during World War II. From the 1950s, and up until 1965, the basins were utilised by the Royal Navy to <b>mothball</b> dozens of destroyers and frigates from the no longer needed wartime fleet of warships, until they were sold to foreign nations or broken up. By 1967, after barely a hundred years of commercial operations, the docks lay unused and derelict, {{and much of it}} was used for landfill. The largest basin, No 2 dock at the Cogan end, is now completely filled in, grassed over and surrounded by roadways.|$|E
