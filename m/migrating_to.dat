5|$|The {{opening of}} the Houston Ship Channel in 1915 further {{challenged}} the port city. Houston and Texas City, {{as well as other}} ports, rapidly overtook Galveston as leading ports and commercial centers; by 1930 map makers were showing Houston as the major city on the Texas coast, instead of Galveston. Cotton shipping, which Galveston had thoroughly dominated on a worldwide level, began <b>migrating</b> <b>to</b> other ports in Texas and on the West Coast.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{opposing}} theories regarding {{the origins of}} ancient Filipinos. F. Landa Jocano theorizes that the ancestors of the Filipinos evolved locally. Wilhelm Solheim's Island Origin Theory postulates that the peopling of the archipelago transpired via trade networks originating in the Sundaland area around 48,000 to 5000BC rather than by wide-scale migration. The Austronesian Expansion Theory explains that Malayo-Polynesians coming from Taiwan began <b>migrating</b> <b>to</b> the Philippines around 4000BC, displacing earlier arrivals.|$|E
5|$|All whales have a {{thick layer}} of blubber. In species that live near the poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11 inches. This blubber can help with {{buoyancy}} (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through {{a thick layer}} of fat, and energy for fasting when <b>migrating</b> <b>to</b> the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} 19th century, they started <b>migrating</b> <b>to</b> other urban areas, {{especially}} Bombay, Bangalore, Calcutta, Karachi, Madras, Mysore and Poona. The Mangalorean Catholics came to Bombay out of economic necessity. The first permanent settlement of Mangalorean Catholics in Bombay {{was recorded in}} the 1890s. The first Mangalorean Catholic settlement in Madras was recorded in the 1940s. Joachim Alva, a Mangalorean Catholic politician, actively participated in uniting the Mangalorean Catholic community against the British during the Indian Independence Movement.|$|E

5|$|Flatfish are {{demersal}} fish (bottom-feeding fish) that show {{a greater degree}} of asymmetry than any other vertebrates. The larvae are at first bilaterally symmetrical but they undergo metamorphosis during the course of their development, with one eye <b>migrating</b> <b>to</b> {{the other side of the}} head, and they simultaneously start swimming on their side. This has the advantage that, when they lie on the seabed, both eyes are on top, giving them a broad field of view. The upper side is usually speckled and mottled for camouflage, while the underside is pale.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede {{also has}} polar caps, likely {{composed}} of water frost. The frost extends to 40° latitude. These polar caps were first {{seen by the}} Voyager spacecraft. Theories on {{the formation of the}} caps include the migration of water to higher latitudes and bombardment of the ice by plasma. Data from Galileo suggests the latter is correct. The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in more intense charged particle bombardment of its surface in the unprotected polar regions; sputtering then leads to redistribution of water molecules, with frost <b>migrating</b> <b>to</b> locally colder areas within the polar terrain.|$|E
5|$|Monson {{initiated}} French-speaking proselytizing {{efforts in}} Quebec. He directed increased missionary work to {{immigrants from the}} Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Italy, Soviet Union and Hungary. Jacob de Jager, a future LDS general authority, was among the immigrant converts. Monson encouraged members to remain in eastern Canada, instead of <b>migrating</b> <b>to</b> Utah or Alberta as many members had done before, to help build the church's presence. To help encourage members to stay in Canada, increase the perception of permanence, and better reach potential converts, he started a major construction program for new meetinghouses. Until then, most branches had used rented halls.|$|E

After the {{collapse}} of the Chwezi Empire of Uganda, a man named Wamoyi <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> Tiriki with his three sons (Wanga, Khabiakala and Eshifumbi).

Angulu (Wanga's nephew) <b>migrated</b> <b>to</b> Butere. His offspring founded the Abakhuli, Abashiambitsi, Abakhongo and Abaseta. Martin Shikuku was from Abarecheya. With over 40% of the population, Abamukhula is the dominant clan with several subclans and they are the “real” Abamarama. Other big clans are the Abashirotsa, Abatere, Abashieni, Abamanyulia, Abalukhoba.|$|R
5|$|Of {{the major}} groups of teleosts, the Elopomorpha, Clupeomorpha and Percomorpha (perches, tunas and many others) {{all have a}} {{worldwide}} distribution and are mainly marine; the Ostariophysi and Osteoglossomorpha are worldwide but mainly freshwater, the latter mainly in the tropics; the Atherinomorpha (guppies, etc.) have a worldwide distribution, both fresh and salt, but are surface-dwellers. In contrast, the Esociformes (pikes) are limited to freshwater in the Northern Hemisphere, while the Salmoniformes (salmon, trout) are found in both Northern and Southern temperate zones in freshwater, some species <b>migrating</b> <b>to</b> and from the sea. The Paracanthopterygii (cods, etc.) are Northern Hemisphere fish, with both salt and freshwater species.|$|E
5|$|Presque Isle is a recurved, sand spit {{that formed}} {{during the last}} glacial period, or ice age, when the Laurentide Ice Sheet {{advanced}} into the basin now occupied by Lake Erie, and, when it retreated to the north between 12,370BC and 12,790BC, left behind a moraine consisting of clay, sand, and gravel that initially formed the Presque Isle peninsula.

5|$|The {{main area}} of inhabitation of Bantu ethnic {{minorities}} in Somalia {{has historically been}} in village enclaves in the south, particularly between the Jubba and Shebelle river valleys {{as well as the}} Bakool and Bay regions.

The displacement caused by the onset of the civil war in the 1990s further increased the number of rural minorities <b>migrating</b> <b>to</b> urban areas. As a consequence of these movements, Mogadishu's traditional demographic makeup changed significantly over the years.|$|E
5|$|The pier was an {{immediate}} success and quickly {{became one of the}} most popular landmarks in Brighton. By 1911, the reading rooms had been converted into a theatre.

During World War I, the sea surrounding the pier was extensively mined to prevent enemy attacks. In the 1920s, the pier was widened, and a distinctive clock tower was added.|$|E
5|$|The {{sex ratio}} of male to female dragonflies varies both {{temporally}} and spatially. Adult dragonflies {{have a high}} male-biased ratio at breeding habitats. The male-bias ratio has contributed partially to the females using different habitats to avoid male harassment. As seen in Hine's emerald dragonfly (Somatochlora hineana), male populations use wetland habitats, while females use dry meadows and marginal breeding habitats, only <b>migrating</b> <b>to</b> the wetlands to lay their eggs or to find mating partners. Unwanted mating is energetically costly for females because it affects {{the amount of time}} that they are able to spend foraging.|$|E
