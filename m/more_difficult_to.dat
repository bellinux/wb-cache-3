5|$|By 1890, an {{alternate}} route through Glenwood Springs {{had been completed}} and the route through the Black Canyon, being <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> operate, lost importance for through trains. The route was finally abandoned in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Complicated UTIs are <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{treat and}} usually {{requires}} more aggressive evaluation, treatment and follow-up. It may require identifying and addressing the underlying complication. Increasing antibiotic resistance is causing {{concern about the}} future of treating those with complicated and recurrent UTI.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} mostly forages in the {{understory}} {{instead of}} the canopy. The large leaves and long branches in the understory affect its foraging behaviors. The black-throated blue warbler more often hovers rather than gleans its prey because it is <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> glean among thick understory foliage.|$|E

5|$|The latter {{three were}} {{canceled}} {{before reaching the}} market. By 1997, {{it was apparent that}} the IA-64 architecture and the compiler were much <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> implement than originally thought, and the delivery timeframe of Merced began slipping.|$|E
5|$|There {{were about}} 100 {{reliably}} reported deaths from spider bites in the 20th century, compared to about 1,500 from jellyfish stings. Many alleged cases of spider bites may represent incorrect diagnoses, {{which would make}} it <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> check the effectiveness of treatments for genuine bites.|$|E
5|$|Without the docking-pit, the {{caissons}} and extremities of {{the arms}} of the wheel would be immersed in water at the lower canal basin each time the wheel rotated. The buoyancy of the lower caisson would make it <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> turn the wheel.|$|E
50|$|Aggarwal and Yu (2008) {{note that}} when {{there is more than}} one {{sensitive}} field the l-diversity problem becomes <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> due <b>to</b> added dimensionalities.|$|R

5|$|A more {{indirect}} {{effect would be}} that the contracted s and p1/2 orbitals shield (take on themselves) the charge of the nucleus more effectively, leaving even less for the outer d and f electrons, which therefore move on larger orbitals. Dubnium is greatly affected by this: unlike the previous group 5 members, its 7s electrons are <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> extract from an atom than the 6d electrons, though these energy levels remain close to each other.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} traditions are upheld and {{recognised}} by choristers. Club members snap their fingers instead of clapping at each other's achievements (i.e. {{a good performance}} on a solo) because it is <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> clap with one's music in the other hand. The club hosts a banquet every spring where awards are presented.|$|E
5|$|Advanced {{methods of}} loading were not {{foreseen}} when the ships were designed. While the new processes are more efficient, loading is <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> control (it {{can take over}} an hour just to halt the operation), occasionally resulting in overloading the ship. These unexpected shocks, over time, can damage the hull's structural integrity.|$|E

5|$|Alex Parker, {{the leader}} of the team that {{performed}} the analysis of the images at the Southwest Research Institute, said that S/2015 (136472) 1's orbit appears to be aligned edge-on to Earth-based observatories. This would make it much <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> detect because it would be lost in Makemake's glare much of the time and, along with its dark surface, would contribute to previous surveys failing to observe it.|$|E
5|$|Americium {{has been}} {{produced}} in small quantities in nuclear reactors for decades, and kilograms of its 241Am and 243Am isotopes have been accumulated by now. Nevertheless, {{since it was}} first offered for sale in 1962, its price, about 1,500 USD per gram of 241Am, remains almost unchanged owing to the very complex separation procedure. The heavier isotope 243Am is produced in much smaller amounts; it is thus <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> separate, resulting in a higher cost of the order 100,000–160,000 USD/g.|$|E
5|$|An avid cyclist, Bonds {{chose the}} {{activity}} to be a {{primary means of}} keeping in shape and great passion since his playing career. Because knee surgeries, back surgeries, and hip surgeries made it much <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> run, cycling has allowed him to engage in sufficient cardiovascular activity to help keep in shape.

5|$|Batygin and Brown also {{predict a}} yet-to-be-discovered {{population}} of distant objects. These objects would have semi-major axes greater than , {{but they would}} have lower eccentricities and orbits that would be aligned with that of Planet Nine. The larger perihelia of these objects would make them fainter and <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> detect than the anti-aligned objects.|$|E
5|$|Despite Allied concerns, Tirpitz posed only {{a limited}} danger to Allied shipping. From late 1943 the {{battleship}} was unable to put to sea for crew training due {{to the threat of}} Allied attack and fuel shortages. These shortages also meant the Germans were unable to move the battleship between anchorages to make her <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> locate and attack.|$|E
5|$|During heavy rains, it {{was much}} <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> track insurgents by air, negating Portugal's air superiority, and Portuguese troops and {{vehicles}} found movement during rain storms difficult. In contrast, the insurgent troops, with lighter equipment, were able to flee into the bush (the mato) amongst an ethnically similar populace into which they could melt away. Furthermore, the FRELIMO forces were able to forage food from the surroundings and local villages, and were thus not hampered by long supply lines.|$|E

5|$|During {{the winter}} and spring, when the water levels were higher, otters had a greater {{tendency}} to prey upon crayfish (73% of scats had crayfish remains) rather than fish. However, when water levels are lower, crayfish will seek out shelter while fish become more highly concentrated and susceptible to predation. Therefore, fish are more vulnerable to being preyed upon by otters because the crayfish have become <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> obtain.|$|E
5|$|Even {{within the}} same phases, their self-assembled {{structures}} are tunable by the concentration: for example, in lamellar phases, the layer distances increase with the solvent volume. Since lyotropic liquid crystals rely on a subtle balance of intermolecular interactions, it is <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> analyze their structures and properties than those of thermotropic liquid crystals.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{a second}} hostage crisis, General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began to shift strategy. The UN began redeploying its forces to more {{defensible}} locations, {{so that they would}} be harder to attack and so that it would be <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> take UN personnel hostage. General Michael Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed land unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E
