5|$|Counting {{symmetry}} partitions valid Band1 permutations into {{classes that}} place the same completion constraints on lower bands; {{all members of}} a band counting symmetry equivalence class <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same number of grid completions since the completion constraints are equivalent. Counting symmetry constraints are identified by the Band1 column triplets (a column value set, no implied element order). Using band counting symmetry, a minimal generating set of 44 equivalence classes was established.|$|E
5|$|Although, in many areas, Scalia's {{approach}} was unfavorable to criminal defendants, {{he took the}} side of defendants in matters involving the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees defendants the right to confront their accusers. In multiple cases, Scalia wrote against laws that allowed alleged victims of child abuse to testify behind screens or by closed-circuit television. In a 2009 case, Scalia wrote the majority opinion in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, holding that defendants <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to confront lab technicians in drug cases and that a certificate of analysis {{is not enough to}} prove a substance was a drug.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} the {{implication}} graph, two literals {{belong to the same}} strongly connected component whenever there exist chains of implications from one literal to the other and vice versa. Therefore, the two literals <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same value in any satisfying assignment to the given 2-satisfiability instance. In particular, if a variable and its negation both belong to the same strongly connected component, the instance cannot be satisfied, because it is impossible to assign both of these literals the same value. As Aspvall et al. showed, this is a necessary and sufficient condition: a 2-CNF formula is satisfiable if and only if there is no variable that belongs to the same strongly connected component as its negation.|$|E
5|$|The Prime Minister of Canada is an {{official}} {{who serves as}} the primary minister of the Crown, chair of the Cabinet, and thus head of government of Canada. Officially, the prime minister is appointed by the Governor General of Canada, but by constitutional convention, the prime minister <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> confidence of the elected House of Commons. Normally, this {{is the leader of}} the party caucus with the greatest number of seats in the house. But, if that leader lacks support of the majority, the governor general can appoint another leader who has that support or may dissolve parliament and call a new election. By constitutional convention, a prime minister holds a seat in parliament and, since the early 20th century, this has more specifically meant the House of Commons.|$|E
5|$|The {{limitation}} of the argument so far is that it only shows {{the existence of a}} necessary existent, and that is different from showing the existence of God as worshipped in Islam. An atheist might agree that a necessary existent exists, but it could be the universe itself, or there could be many necessary existents, none of which is God. Avicenna is aware of this limitation, and his works contains numerous arguments to show the necessary existent <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> attributes associated with God identified in Islam.|$|E

5|$|On {{the eve of}} the marathon, all the {{entrants}} of {{the race}} except for the Finns, whose positions were known, filed a petition asking Nurmi's entry to be accepted. Edström's right-hand man Bo Ekelund, secretary general of the IAAF and head of the Swedish Athletics Federation, approached the Finnish officials and stated that {{he might be able to}} arrange for Nurmi to participate in the marathon outside the competition. However, Finland maintained that as long as the athlete is not declared a professional, he <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right to participate in the race officially. Although he had been diagnosed with a pulled Achilles tendon two weeks earlier, Nurmi stated he would have won the event by five minutes. The congress concluded without Nurmi being declared a professional, but the council's authority to disbar an athlete was upheld on a 13–12 vote. However, due to the close vote, the matter was postponed until the 1934 meet in Stockholm. Finns charged that the Swedish officials had used devious tricks in their campaign against Nurmi's amateur status, and ceased all athletic relations with Sweden. A year earlier, controversies on the track and in the press had led Finland to withdraw from the Finland-Sweden athletics international. After Nurmi's suspension, Finland did not agree to return to the event until 1939.|$|E
