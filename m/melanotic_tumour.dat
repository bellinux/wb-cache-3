40|$|Variegation in Drosophila is a {{manifest}} {{illustration of}} the important role played by chromatin structure in gene expression. We have isolated mutants of modulo (mod) and shown that this gene is a dominant suppressor of variegation. Null mutants are recessive lethal with a <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumour</b> phenotype. The mod protein directly binds DNA, which indicates that it may serve to anchor multimeric complexes promoting chromatin compaction and silencing. Using a specific monoclonal antibody we examined by immunocytochemistry the accumulation pattern of mod protein during embryogenesis. The protein is first detected before the blastoderm cellularization in all somatic nuclei, precisely when pericentromeric heterochromatin becomes visible. After the first cell division, mod protein is expressed in lineages of specific embryonic primordia. Based on its dominant phenotype, expression pattern and DNA-binding activity of its product, we propose that mod regulates chromatin structure and activity in specific cell lineages...|$|E
40|$|MELANOMA of {{the optic}} disk is rare {{so that the}} {{opportunity}} of making a histological examination seldom occurs. Historical. -Michail (1934) summarized the literature referring to 42 cases of pigmentation of the optic disk and added reports of four examples. Of these 46 cases, six had been studied histologically. FranQois (1934) also gave a full r 6 sume of the literature. Brief mention may be made of three of these reports, which have points of particular resemblance to the present case. Liebreich (1863) illustrated a pigmented optic nerve head in which the point of emergence of the retinal vessels was enclosed by intense black streaks arranged in bundles covering almost one-third of the disk. Hirschberg (1883) illustrated the striated appearance of the tumour in his case, which was, however, of a reddish colour. Palich-Szainto (1915) also remarked on striation {{comparable to that of}} opaque nerve fibres. Few reports include details of the visual fields, but Pilich-SzInto mentions the absence of any defect. Oguchi (1933), on the other hand, found a peripheral field loss, but his case (not included in the reviews mentioned above) was shown to be a <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumour</b> occupying the nasal half of the optic disk itself, which he considered to have arisen {{on the basis of a}} congenital melanoma...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} the function of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) in Drosophila melanogaster, and a potential effector of such modification, the chromatin remodelling factor dATRX. A substrate of SUMO modification, the transcriptional repressor Tramtrack 69 was verified, and the site of SUMO modification narrowed to a single lysine residue. Mutation of this prevented SUMOylation, and the functional consequence of this was analysed in a variety of assays, including transcriptional repression, subcellular localisation, degradation and overexpression in fly tissues. The ETS-domain transcription factor Pointed was also identified as a potential SUMO substrate and the functional consequences of such a modification analysed in a similar manner. The role of SUMOylation in the intact fly was analysed through clonal loss of function and overexpression phenotypes in both adult and larval fly tissues, implicating it in wing and eye development and <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumour</b> formation. The similarities to the phenotypes of mutation in dISW 1, another chromatin remodelling factor are discussed. SUMO was shown to be a strong suppressor of position effect variegation (PEV) and potential mechanisms for its action are discussed. The mechanism by which SUMOylation acts is addressed through analysis of SUMO interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid screen. This identified the chromatin remodelling complexes NuRD and dATRX and the histone methyltransferase pR-Set 7 as potential effectors of SUMO modification, which were verified by GST-pulldown assay. They were shown to interact with wild type SUMO but not a mutant form that is unable to repress transcription, suggesting a possible role in transcriptional repression by SUMO.

40|$|A LARGE {{proportion}} of the published work on skin carcinogenesis in the hamster ((Cricetus auratus) {{is concerned with the}} study of the <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumours</b> which are readily induced in the skin of this species. The subject of these tumours has been recently reviewed by Nakai and Rappaport (1963). The golden hamster has been most used for these experiments, but Illman and Ghadially (1960) showed that 7, 12 -dimethylbenzo[a]anthracene (DMBA) also induces <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumours</b> in the skin of white, but not cream, hamsters. These tumours may be induced by a single application of as little as 50,cg. of DMBA (Shubik, Pietra and Della Porta, 1960), and this efficient carcinogen has been the most widely employed (Della Porta et al., 1956; Horning, 1958; Ghadiallv and Barker, 1960; Illman and Ghadially, 1960). While in some studies <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumours</b> only have been induced by DMBA, changes in the solvent used and in the time schedule of applications may permit also the development of keratoacanthomas (Ghadially. 1959) and squamous cell papillomas and carcinomas (Maltoni and Prodi, 1957) ...|$|R
40|$|IT {{has been}} shown that {{multiple}} cutaneous <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumours</b> are readily produced in the Syrian hamster (Cricetus auratus) by painting with chemical carcinogens (Della Porta et al., 1956; Shubik et al., 1956; Horning, 1958; Ghadially, 1959) and that these tumours arise from a network of melanocytes surrounding some of the pilosebaceous follicles (Ghadially and Barker, 1960; Ghadially, 1960). In Syrian white hamsters amelanotic and hypomelanotic melanomas have been produced and these are believed to arise from amelanotic melanocytic networks around some of their pilosebaceous follicles (Illman and Ghadially, 1960; Rappaport et al., 1961; Quevedo et al., 1961).

40|$|The {{case of a}} 2 -month-old healthy infant without {{relevant}} medical history. The {{patient was}} referred due to the aggravation of a swelling occupying the left half of the anterior maxilla. This lesion became visible approximately one month ago; it involved the buccal gingiva and alveolar bone, including the deciduous tooth germs 6. 1 and 6. 2. The swelling had dimensions of 20 mm x 20 mm. The surgical excision was performed under general anesthesia. The tooth buds of 6. 1 and 6. 2 were {{closely related to the}} tumour and so were removed. The lesion was entirely enucleated. The pathology of the lesion confirmed a <b>melanotic</b> neuroectodermal <b>tumour</b> of infancy. The <b>melanotic</b> neuroectodermal <b>tumour</b> of infancy (MNTI) {{has been described as a}} rare benign pigmented painless swelling that usually occurs in the anterior region of the maxilla and in the incisor region. The histological examination showed small basophilic cells, many containing melanin pigmentation within the cytoplasm, with a second population of larger cubical cells with abundant cytoplasm, arranged in alveolar or adenoid clusters. According to Krompecher this tumour derives from epithelial nests evolved at the time of embryonic fusion of the facial processes. It has also been suggested that the tumour arises from the retinal anlage by a pinching-off process of neuroepithelium during the formation of embryonic eye.

40|$|SUMMARY. -Suckling Syrian golden hamsters were {{injected}} subcutaneously with 10 % saline {{solution of}} urethane, at {{a dose of}} 1 mg. /g. of body weight, {{once a week for}} 6 weeks. The majority of the animals, which survived more than 52 weeks, developed nodular hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex and of the pancreatic islet. Eight adrenal cortical tumours, including two metastasizing ones, and a:-cell tumour of the pancreatic islet were also found in the 28 treated hamsters. The histology of the adrenal lesions suggests that there are possible progressive steps from the hyperplastic nodules {{to the development of the}} tumours. URETHANE has been found to be a multipotential carcinogen in several strainis of mice. Tumours of various organs including the lung, liver, ovary, thymus, lymph node, Harderian gland and others, are induced (Tannenbaum and Silverstone, 1958; Della Porta et al., 1967; Vesselinovitch and Mihailovich, 1967; Matsuyama and Suzuki, 1968). Urethane also has a broad spectrum of action in rats inducing pulmonary adenomas, hepatomas, brain tumours, mammary fibroadenomas, and uterine sarcomas (Jaffe, 1947; Tannenbaum et al., 1962; Vesselinovitch and Mihailovich, 1968 a and b). The target organs for this carcinogen in Syrian hamsters differ from those in mice and rats. <b>Melanotic</b> <b>tumours</b> of the skin and papillomas of the forestomach are induced when this chemical is administered to hamsters in the drinking water (Pietra and Shubik, 1960; Toth, Tomatis and Shubik, 1961).

40|$|Summary. -In a {{previous}} report {{we have shown}} that a few substances, especially thiouracil, are incorporated as false precursors into melanin during its synthesis.

A relatively linear increase in uptake with dose was found, indicating that the melanin incorporation of thiouracil is non-saturable up to subtoxic levels. METASTASES from malignant melanomas are known to be difficult to localize and treat successfully (Comis & Carter, 1974). However, Hornsey (1978) has found that melanomas respond relatively well to radiotherapy if proper doses and time intervals for the treatment are chosen. This makes techniques for a selective irradiation of melanomas attractive. In our group, we have for some time been interested in finding new methods for diagnosing and treating melanomas by using radioactively labelled substances which are selectively incorporated into growing melanin as false melanin precursors. In a preliminary report, we earlier showed that thiouracil strongly accumulates in growing melanin, for example in the eyes of young animals and in melanotic melanomas. Thiouracil is apparently used as a false precursor in the synthesis of melanin (Dencker et al., 1979; 1981). The mechanism for this uptake is thus different from that of many polycyclic amines (e. g. chloroquine, chlorpromazine), which bind to preformed * To whom all correspondence should be addressed...|$|R
40|$|Myeloproliferative {{neoplasms}} (MPNs) of the Philadelphia-negative class comprise polycythaemia vera, essential thrombocythaemia {{and primary}} myelofibrosis (PMF). They {{are associated with}} aberrant numbers of myeloid lineage cells in the blood, {{and in the case}} of overt PMF, with development of myelofibrosis in the bone marrow and failure to produce normal blood cells. These diseases are usually caused by gain-of-function mutations in the kinase JAK 2. Here, we use Drosophila to investigate the consequences of activation of the JAK 2 orthologue in haematopoiesis. We have identified maturing haemocytes in the lymph gland, the major haematopoietic organ in the fly, as the cell population susceptible to induce hypertrophy upon targeted overexpression of JAK. We show that JAK activates a feed-forward loop, including the cytokine-like ligand Upd 3 and its receptor, Domeless, which are required to induce lymph gland hypertrophy. Moreover, we present evidence that p 38 MAPK signalling plays a key role in this process by inducing expression of the ligand Upd 3. Interestingly, we also show that forced activation of the p 38 MAPK pathway in maturing haemocytes suffices to generate hypertrophic organs and the appearance of <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumours.</b> Our results illustrate a novel pro-tumourigenic crosstalk between the p 38 MAPK pathway and JAK signalling in a Drosophila model of MPNs. Based on the shared molecular mechanisms underlying MPNs in flies and humans, the interplay between Drosophila JAK and p 38 signalling pathways unravelled in this work might have translational relevance for human MPNs.
