40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a framework for}} constructing network services for accessing media objects. The framework, called end-to-end <b>media</b> <b>paths,</b> provides a new approach for building multimedia applications from component pieces. Based on input from the user and resource requirements from the media object, the system first discovers the sequence of nodes (end-to-end path) that both connect the source device to the sink device and possess sufficient resources to play the object. It then configures the individual nodes along this path with the modules (path segment) that implement the service...|$|R

5000|$|SBCs {{can extend}} {{the length of}} the <b>media</b> <b>path</b> (the way of media packets through the network) significantly. A long <b>media</b> <b>path</b> is undesirable, as it {{increases}} the delay of voice packets and the probability of packet loss. Both effects deteriorate the voice/video quality. However, many times there are obstacles to communication such as firewalls between the call parties, and in these cases SBCs offer an efficient method to guide media streams towards an acceptable path between caller and callee; without the SBC the call media would be blocked. Some SBCs can detect if the ends of the call are in the same subnetwork and release control of the media enabling it to flow directly between the clients, this is anti-tromboning or media release. Also, some SBCs can create a <b>media</b> <b>path</b> where none would otherwise be allowed to exist (by virtue of various firewalls and other security apparatus between the two endpoints). Lastly, for specific VoIP network models where the service provider owns the network, SBCs can actually decrease the <b>media</b> <b>path</b> by shortcut routing approaches. For example, a service provider that provides trunking services to several enterprises would usually allocate each enterprise a VPN. It is often desirable to have the option to interconnect the VPN through SBCs. A VPN-aware SBC may perform this function {{at the edge of the}} VPN network, rather than sending all the traffic to the core.|$|E

5000|$|Anti-tromboning (also {{referred}} to as anti-hairpinning or media release) is a feature employed in telecommunication networks, such as voice over IP networks, that optimises {{the use of the}} access network and reduces excess processing and traffic. A network border node, such as a Session Border Controller, handling calls as they pass from the access network to the core network can examine the IP address or domains of both the caller and called parties and if they reside in the same part of the network the <b>media</b> <b>path</b> can be released allowing media to flow directly between the two parties without entering the access network. [...] The benefits of this action are twofold: 1) the caller is not paying for any bandwidth usage on the carrier network (but may be arbitrarily paying for the carrier's handoff service) and 2) The carrier's network is less congested.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to common criticisms against Digital Rights Management schemes, {{there has been}} speculation that this scheme has been motivated {{by the fact that}} it would affect official free/open source graphics driver support by manufacturers. The scheme relies on the internals of graphics cards to tell whether the hardware is trustworthy (permitted to play copy-protected content). This could be subverted if an attacker knows certain details about the hardware's operation, which could be disclosed by hardware documentation or open source device drivers. However, this will not affect platform independency, as the scheme is provided with no charge. Microsoft has frequently been accused of adding the Protected <b>Media</b> <b>Path</b> feature to Vista to block customers from copying rightfully owned media content (a practice believed to be protected by Fair Use provisions of the Copyright Act), and the feature is widely quoted as an example of Microsoft's uncompromising adherence to DRM.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{the media}} {{pipeline}} components are not connected; rather {{they are just}} presented as discrete components. An application running in the Control layer has to choose which source types, transforms and sinks are needed for the particular video processing task at hand, {{and set up the}} [...] "connections" [...] between the components (a topology) to complete the data flow pipeline. For example, to play back a compressed audio/video file, the pipeline will consist of a file source object, a demultiplexer for the specific file container format to split the audio and video streams, codecs to decompress the audio and video streams, DSP processors for audio and video effects and finally the EVR renderer, in sequence. Or for a video capture application, the camcorder will act as video and audio sources, on which codec MFTs will work to compress the data and feed to a multiplexer that coalesces the streams into a container; and finally a file sink or a network sink will write it to a file or stream over a network. The application also has to co-ordinate the flow of data between the pipeline components. The control layer has to [...] "pull" [...] (request) samples from one pipeline component and pass it onto the next component in order to achieve data flow within the pipeline. This is in contrast to DirectShow's [...] "push" [...] model where a pipeline component pushes data to the next component. Media Foundation allows content protection by hosting the pipeline within a protected execution environment, called the Protected <b>Media</b> <b>Path.</b> The control layer components are required to propagate the data through the pipeline at a rate that the rendering synchronizes with the presentation clock. The rate (or time) of rendering is embedded {{as a part of the}} multimedia stream as metadata. The source objects extract the metadata and pass it over. Metadata is of two types: coded metadata, which is information about bit rate and presentation timings, and descriptive metadata, like title and author names. Coded metadata is handed over to the object that controls the pipeline session, and descriptive metadata is exposed for the application to use if it chooses to.|$|E

The ZRTP protocol is <b>media</b> <b>path</b> keying because it is multiplexed on the same port as RTP and does not require support in the signaling protocol. ZRTP does not assume a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or require the complexity of certificates in end devices. For the media session, ZRTP provides confidentiality, protection against man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, and, in cases where the signaling protocol provides end-to-end integrity protection, authentication. ZRTP can utilize a Session Description Protocol (SDP) attribute to provide discovery and authentication through the signaling channel. To provide best effort SRTP, ZRTP utilizes normal RTP/AVP (Audio-Visual Profile) profiles. ZRTP secures media sessions that include a voice media stream and can also secure media sessions that do not include voice by using an optional digital signature.

40|$|Existing {{standard}} protocols for {{the web and}} Internet telephony fail {{to deliver}} real-time interactive communication from within a web browser. In particular, the client-server web protocol over reliable TCP is not always suitable for end-to-end low latency <b>media</b> <b>path</b> needed for interactive voice and video communication. To solve this, we compare the available platform options using the existing technologies such as modifying the web programming language and protocol, using an existing web browser plugin, and a separate host resident application that the web browser can talk to. We argue that using a separate application as an adaptor is a promising short term as well as long-term strategy for voice and video communications on the web. Our project aims at developing the open technology and sample implementations for web-based real-time voice and video communication applications. We describe the architecture of our project including (1) a RESTful web communication API over HTTP inspired by SIP message flows, (2) a web-friendly set of metadata for session description, and (3) an UDP-based end-to-end <b>media</b> <b>path.</b> All other telephony functions reside in the web application itself and/or in web feature servers. The adaptor approach allows us to easily add new voice and video codecs and NAT traversal technologies such as Host Identity Protocol. We want to make web-based communication accessible to millions of web developers, maximize the end user experience and security, and preserve the huge global investment in and experience from SIP systems while adhering to web standards and development tools as much as possible.
