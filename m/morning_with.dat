5|$|Like many {{scientists}} {{working on the}} project, Woods affected a casual attitude towards the danger posed by radiation. After a <b>morning</b> <b>with</b> Willard Libby soldering a canister containing a mixture of radium salt and beryllium metal, Woods absorbed about 200 roentgens, and her {{white blood cell count}} halved. The doctors gave her a lecture on how a woman has only a fixed number of egg cells, a proposition that Woods was skeptical of. She considered that the important thing was that the solder was done correctly. When the team moved to their new home at Argonne, Woods had a dormitory all to herself.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the French Republic {{in the early spring}} of 1793, the French Revolutionary Wars were already a year old. The French Navy was already suffering from the upheavals of the French Revolution and the consequent dissolution of the professional officer class, while the Royal Navy had been at a state of readiness since the summer of 1792. During the early months of the war the French Navy focused heavily on raiding and disrupting British commerce and deployed frigates on raiding operations against British commercial shipping. In the English Channel, two of the most successful raiders were the frigates Réunion and Sémillante, based in Cherbourg on the Cotentin Peninsula. These frigates would make short cruises, leaving Cherbourg in the early evening and returning in the <b>morning</b> <b>with</b> any prizes they had encountered during the night.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War Wodehouse and his wife {{remained}} at their Le Touquet house, where, during the Phoney War, he worked on Joy in the <b>Morning.</b> <b>With</b> the advance of the Germans, the nearby Royal Air Force base withdrew; Wodehouse was offered the sole spare seat in one of the fighter aircraft, but he turned down the opportunity as it would have meant leaving behind Ethel and their dog. On 21 May 1940, with German troops advancing through northern France, the Wodehouses decided to drive to Portugal and fly from there to the US. Two miles from home their car broke down, so they returned and borrowed a car from a neighbour; with the routes blocked with refugees, they returned home again.|$|E

Johnston ended with 4/40 from 27.3 overs while Lindwall took 3/50 from 25 overs. Miller claimed 2/22 while Ring bowled the most overs, 28, to finish with 1/44. Given the time lost to inclement weather on the first day, Australia had won the match {{in less than three}} days of playing time.|$|E
5|$|Having {{observed}} the sessions and received {{feedback from the}} drivers and the teams about the circuit conditions, the series' president of competition Brian Barnhart and course designer Tony Cotman opted to postpone the qualification session to race <b>morning,</b> <b>with</b> the running of a third practice session and a Sunday morning warm-up instead of it. Power topped this extra session, ahead of Kanaan and Ryan Hunter-Reay, with Justin Wilson—a new arrival at Dreyer & Reinbold Racing—in fourth position. After the session, track officials started grinding down the concrete {{in order to provide}} a track surface that was suitable for racing the following day. Hunter-Reay topped the Sunday morning warmup before qualifying, setting the fastest lap time by over half a second ahead of second-year driver Mike Conway in another Dreyer & Reinbold car.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} keep up {{pressure}} on the whole front, the 19th Indian Brigade was ordered to attack Villa Grande and exploit any gains {{as far as the}} Arielli river which ran from the mountains through Tollo to the Adriatic. The attack went in at 05:30 on 22 December but failed in desperate fighting. The 1/5th Battalion, Essex Regiment renewed their attack the following <b>morning</b> <b>with</b> more success. After a counterattack by German paratroops had been repulsed at midday, the Essex advanced to mop up the remainder of the village. However, deadly small scale house-to-house battles continued throughout the rest of 23 December and for the next two days as the determined parachute soldiers clung on. To the south of Villa Grande, the 3rd/15th Punjabis had taken Vezzano on 23 December and a continuous brigade line had been established.|$|E
