5|$|The most {{significant}} {{of the new}} contacts was Busoni. The great pianist and composer became Szigeti's mentor during these formative years, and the two would remain close friends until Busoni's death in 1924. By Szigeti's own admission, before meeting Busoni his life was characterized by a certain laziness and indifference {{brought on by the}} then-typical life of a young prodigy violinist. He had grown accustomed to playing crowd-pleasing salon miniatures and dazzling virtuosic encores without much thought. He knew little of the works of the great masters; he could play them, but not fully understand them. As Szigeti put it, Busoni—particularly through their careful study of Bach's Chaconne—"shook <b>me</b> <b>once</b> and for all out of my adolescent complacency".|$|E

25|$|Upon its release, Kiss <b>Me</b> <b>Once</b> {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} most music critics. The {{majority of them}} complimented Minogue's charm and vocal delivery, alongside her return to contemporary pop music. However, critics were polarised towards the content and production; some felt the material was fun, but majority dismissed its memorability and felt it lacked innovation on Minogue's behalf. Commercially, the album performed moderately worldwide, and reached the top 10 in regions like Australia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, France, New Zealand, and Canada. The lack of commercial success for Kiss <b>Me</b> <b>Once</b> prompt Minogue to leave the company, citing artistic differences.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, [...] "Crazy for You" [...] {{is set in}} the time signature of common time, with a medium tempo of 104 beats per minute. It {{is set in the}} key of E major with Madonna's voice spanning between the high note of C5 to the low note of G3. The song has a basic sequence of E–A–B–A as its chord progression. Unlike her previous singles, the chord sequence does not repeat itself and the chorus slowly unravels to the climax of the song. Lyrically, the song talks about extreme love for one another. It contains innuendos similar to The Crystals' 1963 song [...] "Then He Kissed Me". According to scholar Dave Marsh, the lyrics talk about frank sexual desire among two teenagers.
