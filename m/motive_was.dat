5|$|In June 2004, Williamson {{was murdered}} in his {{apartment}} by an acquaintance, Dwight Hayden, whom he had been aiding with financial handouts. Police believed that Hayden's <b>motive</b> <b>was</b> robbery, although J-FLAG also suggested that homophobia {{may have played a}} part in the killing. Hayden was subsequently sentenced to life in prison. Upon learning of the murder, a crowd assembled in New Kingston to celebrate Williamson's death, chanting homophobic slogans and lyrics. Conversely, the Jamaican LGBT community held a secret memorial for him, while protests against the killing were held by LGBT rights groups in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{crash of}} National Airlines Flight 2511 came {{shortly after the}} crash of another National Airlines plane. National Airlines Flight 967 {{exploded}} over the Gulf of Mexico on November 16, 1959.

Spears was heavily insured, and the FBI indicated that his <b>motive</b> <b>was</b> insurance fraud. Similarly, Julian Frank was covered by almost $900,000 in life insurance policies, including some purchased the day of the crash.|$|E
40|$|Aims This study {{examined}} whether parental drinking <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> associated with young adults' drinking motives, and {{their association with}} young adults' drinking behaviors. Methods: The sample consisted of 290 18 -year-old and 289 20 -year-old drinking young adults and their parents. Results: For the younger group, stronger maternal coping <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> related to stronger social and enhancement motives, while stronger paternal coping <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> associated with stronger young adult coping motives. For the older group, stronger maternal coping <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> related to stronger social motives and stronger paternal enhancement <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> associated with stronger overall young adult drinking motives. For the younger group, both enhancement and conformity <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> predictive of their alcohol use. For the older group, only higher social <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> predictive of higher alcohol use. Both groups' higher coping and enhancement <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> associated with more drinking problems. Conclusions: While, concerning content, there are some differences due to parent gender and adolescent age, stronger parental drinking <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> indeed associated with stronger adolescent drinking motives, which in turn are quite consistently related to more adolescent alcohol use and alcohol-related problems...|$|R

50|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} ways a defendants <b>motive</b> can <b>be</b> pertinent {{to his or}} her criminal liability. <b>Motive</b> can <b>be</b> fully inculpatory or exculpatory or only partially inculpatory or exculpatory. When one has acted with a specific motive, lawful behavior becomes illegal, and this <b>is</b> when <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> fully inculpatory. If illegal activity with a particular motive does not hold a defendant responsible than that <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> fully exculpatory. When a motive supplies inadequate defense to a crime, the <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> partially exculpatory. When a motive says the kind of infraction for which the defendant <b>is</b> responsible, the <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> partially inculpatory.|$|R
5|$|While Damageplan was {{promoting}} the album {{at a concert}} on December 8, 2004, at the Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio, a man named Nathan Gale climbed on stage and killed lead guitarist Darrell and three others, and wounding another seven, before being shot dead by a police officer. Although no <b>motive</b> <b>was</b> found, some witnesses claimed Gale blamed the brothers for Pantera's breakup and believed that they had stolen his lyrics. The band's manager confirmed there are unreleased Damageplan recordings, although they have not surfaced, and the band has been inactive since the incident. Abbott and Zilla have joined the band Hellyeah, and Lachman joined The Mercy Clinic.|$|E
5|$|After the {{standoff}} entered its fourth hour, Valencia {{succeeded in getting}} Saldívar to confess that she had intended to shoot herself. Saldívar said when she placed the gun to her own head, Selena {{tried to tell her}} not to kill herself. When Selena opened the door to leave, Saldívar said she told her to close it. She also said the gun went off when Selena left. During the sixth hour, Saldívar agreed to give herself up, but when she saw a police officer pointing a rifle at her, she panicked, ran back to her truck, picked up the revolver, and pointed it at her head again. Saldívar surrendered after more than nine hours. By then, hundreds of Selena's fans had gathered at the scene; many wept as police took Saldívar away. A press conference was called within hours of Selena's murder; Saldívar had not yet been named in media reports. Assistant Police Chief Ken Bung and Quintanilla, Jr. told the press the possible <b>motive</b> <b>was</b> Selena's intention to terminate Saldívar's employment.|$|E
5|$|Detective Ybarra (Kelly) {{travels to}} a ranch in Wineville, Riverside County, {{to arrange the}} {{deportation}} of 15-year-old Sanford Clark (Eddie Alderson) to Canada. The boy's uncle, Gordon Northcott (Harner), has fled after a chance encounter with Ybarra, who mentions his business there being a juvenile matter. Clark tells Ybarra that Northcott forced him to help kidnap and murder around twenty children, and identifies Walter as one of them. Jones tells Briegleb that Christine is in protective custody following a mental breakdown. Jones orders Clark's deportation, but Ybarra takes Clark to the murder site and tells him to dig where the bodies are buried. Clark hesitates, but soon uncovers body parts. Briegleb secures Christine's release by showing Steele a newspaper story about the Wineville killings that names Walter as a possible victim. Under interrogation by Ybarra, Walter's impostor reveals his <b>motive</b> <b>was</b> to secure transport to Los Angeles to see his favorite actor, Tom Mix, and says the police told him to lie about being Christine's son. The police capture Northcott in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Christine's attorney (Pierson) secures a court order {{for the release of}} other unjustly imprisoned women who the police wanted to silence.|$|E
40|$|Although episodic {{volunteers are}} a {{critical}} resource for many organisations, their <b>motives</b> for volunteering <b>are</b> poorly understood. A systematic review {{was conducted to}} describe empirical evidence about motives for episodic volunteering (EV) across sectors (sport, tourism, events, health and social welfare). Identified EV <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> then categorised using core functions from the Volunteer Functions Inventory (VFI) for comparison across studies. Twelve databases (1990 –December 2014) were searched. Thirty-three English language studies included results describing EV <b>motives.</b> Studies <b>were</b> predominantly cross-sectional, quantitative, event-based and originating in North America. Measurement of <b>motives</b> <b>was</b> also inconsistent. Common <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> helping others and socialising. Physical challenge and healing <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> specific to sport-based events and charity sport events, respectively. Over 80 % of <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> classified using VFI functions, particularly enhancement, values and social functions.

5|$|With the {{approval}} of Diệm, Nhu used the declaration of martial law to order armed men into the Buddhist pagodas. Nhu chose {{a time when he}} knew the American Embassy was leaderless. Frederick Nolting had returned to the United States and his successor Lodge was yet to arrive. As the high command of the ARVN worked closely with American military advisers deployed in the country, Nhu used the combat police and Tung's Special Forces, who took their orders directly from him. The men were dressed in standard army uniforms, such as paratroop attire, to frame the regulars for the raids. Nhu's <b>motive</b> <b>was</b> to avoid responsibility for a violent operation— which would anger the Vietnamese public and the American leadership. In falsely implicating the army in the attacks, Nhu intended to dent the confidence of the Vietnamese populace and the Americans in the senior officers who were plotting against him. Nhu evidently hoped the Buddhist majority and the Americans would blame the army for the raids and become less inclined to support a coup by the generals. In the past, Nhu's tactics in playing the generals against one another had kept conspirators off-balance and thwarted coup attempts. The raids were not unexpected, as the Buddhists had prepared themselves for the attacks, as had journalists, who were watching military installations for signs of movement.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) offers free family {{portraits in}} the office, and {{many members of}} the office take {{advantage}} of the opportunity, including Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) with his very elderly parents, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) with his teenaged daughter Sasha, Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) with her teenaged son, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) with Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), a desperate Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) trying to win back Kelly's affection yet again, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) with a reluctant Jim (John Krasinski) and their children Cecelia and Philip. Senator Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) later comes by with his and Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) son Philip to also get a family portrait. Jim suspects that Dwight's motive for giving away family portraits was to get revenge on Jim for a prank involving a fake Velcro suit, but Dwight's real <b>motive</b> <b>was</b> to try to get some of Philip Lipton's DNA to run a test to determine who Philip's actual father is. Angela is very much against this idea and tries to ensure that Dwight does not get the opportunity. After taking the pictures, Robert notices that Philip's diaper is full, so he goes to change him. After doing so Dwight goes into the bathroom to retrieve the diaper, but Angela chases after him as he makes a break for the hospital to run the DNA test. Dwight and Angela then take part in a high-speed car chase until Dwight calls his cousin Mose (Michael Schur) to take her off his trail with a duplicate Trans Am. Angela later finds him in the hospital waiting area, where he confirms {{he is going to be}} there for the entire 72-hour waiting period for the DNA results. After she sits down, holding his hand, Dwight begins kissing her and Angela briefly demurs before passionately kissing him in return.|$|E

5000|$|A motive, in law, {{especially}} criminal law, is {{the cause}} that moves people to induce a certain action. [...] <b>Motive,</b> in itself, <b>is</b> not an element of any given crime; however, the legal system typically allows <b>motive</b> to <b>be</b> proven {{in order to make}} plausible the accused's reasons for committing a crime, at least when those <b>motives</b> may <b>be</b> obscure or hard to identify with.

40|$|Extract:Motive can {{be defined}} as the emotional, psychological, and {{material}} needs that impel and are satisfied by behavior. In a criminal prosecution, the determination of <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> not necessary. Yet, while this is a legal reality, the failure to make the determination of <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> a significant investigative shortcoming, and any investigation that has failed to yield the motive behind the crime is subsequently incomplete. Determinations of <b>motive</b> <b>are</b> not made directly, as {{it is not possible to}} read the mind of any criminal. Nor are confessions regarding motivation reliable without corroboration. This <b>is</b> because <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> not always the product of deliberate thought; they can subconscious and therefore not directly perceived or understood by those experiencing them...|$|R

40|$|Drinking <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> {{among the}} most {{proximal}} factors for drinking behavior {{and serve as a}} mechanism through which more distal factors are mediated. However, it is less clear whether drinking <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> precursors of drinking or, in contrast, shaped by previous drinking experiences (reciprocal effects), or both. Moreover, in adults it is unclear whether drinking motives, usually shaped in adolescence, influence each other over time. In this longitudinal study (N = 2440, 47 % women, average age 53 years), drinking motives and drinking behavior (i. e., number of drinks on the heaviest drinking day and number of drinking days; both during the past week) were assessed at 2 time points, separated by 3 months. Full cross-lagged regression models revealed that drinking <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> positively associated with drinking behavior over time and that drinking <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> shaped by the number of drinking days (i. e., reciprocal effects). Furthermore, coping and enhancement motives, as well as social and conformity motives, positively reinforced each other. Moreover, social <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> positively associated with enhancement motives over time. In conclusion, drinking motives influence each other over a 3 -month period in adulthood and predict drinking behavior over time, making them important candidates for prevention efforts. Drinking <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> likely to be modifiable and might be used to stimulate drinking decrease...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{structure}} and endorsement of drinking motives and their links to alcohol use among 11 - to 19 -year-olds from 13 European countries. Method: Confirmatory factor analysis, latent growth curves, and multiple regression models were conducted, based on a sample of 33, 813 alcohol-using students from Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Scotland, Slovakia, Switzerland, and Wales who completed the Drinking Motives Questionnaire Revised Short Form (DMQ-R SF). Results: The findings confirmed the hypothesized four-dimensional factor structure. Social <b>motives</b> for drinking <b>were</b> most frequently indicated, followed by enhancement, coping, and conformity motives, in that order, in all age groups in all countries except Finland. This rank order was clearest among older adolescents and those from northern European countries. The results confirmed that, across countries, social <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> strongly positively related to drinking frequency, enhancement <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> strongly positively related to frequency of drunkenness, and conformity <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> negatively related to both alcohol outcomes. Against our expectations, social <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> more closely related to drunkenness than <b>were</b> coping <b>motives,</b> particularly among younger adolescents. Conclusions: The findings reveal striking cross-cultural consistency. Health promotion efforts that are based on, or incorporate, drinking <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> likely to be applicable across Europe. As social <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> particularly closely linked to drunkenness among young adolescents, measures to impede the modeling of alcohol use and skills to resist peer pressure are particularly important in this age group...|$|R
