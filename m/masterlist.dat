40|$|Executive summary In 1999, the National Disease Surveillance Centre (NDSC) {{was asked}} by the Department of Health and Chil dren to review the list of {{notifiable}} diseases and to make recommendations regarding additions or amendments to the current list. It was also asked to review the operation of the no tification system, to co nsider the need for case definitions, and whether laboratories should be required to notify the listed diseases. A sub-com m ittee of the NDSC was established to complete this task. In drawing up the report the sub-committee cons ulted widely with a ll professional grou ps involved in notification of infectious diseases. The main points highlighted in the report are as follows: • A new national system for surveillance of infectious diseases of public health importance should be established. In this system there will be four categories of notifiers, namely GPs, hospital clinic i ans, laboratory directors and public healt h doctors. Each notifier will be required to notify the Director of Public Health listed dis e ases or isolates that they enc ount er during the course of their work. As each c a tegory of notifier is likely to regularly identify only a subset of the total list of diseases, separate lists will be pr esented for each category, as w e ll as one <b>masterlist</b> of al l notifiable diseases. • The report recomme nds that th e term Me dical Officer of Health, which was abolished in law in 1998, be reintroduced, and that the Medical Officer of Health be the Director of Public Health. • There is litt l e advantage in hav ing an appro p riate list of diseases for notification if there is no formal 24 -hour a day, 7 -da ys per week system for responding to urgent notifications that require public health action. The report recommends that this issue be addressed as a matter of urgency. Page 4 • The changes propos ed are wide ranging. In order that the new system envisaged in the report group can be estab lished, a s i gnificant investment of resources will be required. This need for resources will arise in primary care, public healt h, in laboratories and at NDSC. • There is an urgent need to develop a nd support initiatives to introduce electronic communication between all partners in the system. Finally, the sub-committee are of the opinio n that establishing an implementation group would help the ordered, phased intr oduction of th e proposed new system...|$|E
