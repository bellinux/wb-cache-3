25|$|For instance, {{courts of}} law <b>make</b> <b>judgments</b> about whether {{individuals}} are acting {{under their own}} free will under certain circumstances without bringing in metaphysics. Similarly, political liberty is a non-metaphysical concept. Likewise, some compatibilists define free will as freedom to act according to one's determined motives without hindrance from other individuals. So for example Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics, and the Stoic Chrysippus.|$|E
25|$|Research {{instruments}} are also often insufficiently sensitive {{to discriminate between}} independent, true dual pathology, and substance-induced symptoms. Structured instruments, as Global Appraisal of Individual Needs - Short Screener-GAIN-SS and Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders for DSM-IV-PRISM, {{have been developed to}} increase the diagnostic validity. While structured instruments can help organize diagnostic information, clinicians must still <b>make</b> <b>judgments</b> on the origin of symptoms.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{interactive}} {{models have}} been developed that respond to actions taken by a student or physician. Until recently, these simulations were two dimensional computer programs that acted more like a textbook than a patient. Computer simulations {{have the advantage of}} allowing a student to <b>make</b> <b>judgments,</b> and also to make errors. The process of iterative learning through assessment, evaluation, decision making, and error correction creates a much stronger learning environment than passive instruction.|$|E

25|$|In {{regards to}} the mere-exposure effect and {{decision}} making, Zajonc states {{that there has been}} no empirical proof that cognition precedes any form of decision making. While this is a common assumption, Zajonc argues that the opposite is more likely: decisions are made with little to no cognitive process. He equates deciding upon something with liking it, meaning that more often we cognize reasons to rationalize a decision instead of deciding upon it. Therefore, we <b>make</b> <b>judgments</b> first, and then seek to justify those judgments by rationalization.|$|E
25|$|Listeners' {{ratings in}} Barron-Lutzross's {{experiment}} of {{likelihood that a}} speaker is a lesbian correlated with several different phonological variables. Lower median pitch, a wider pitch range, a lower second formant, and more use of creaky voice correlated positively with listeners perceiving a voice as lesbian-sounding. Despite this, Barron-Lutzross {{did not find any}} direct correlations between these phonetic variables and sexual orientation. She stated that this could mean that listeners were using additional features which were not tested for to <b>make</b> <b>judgments</b> about the speakers' sexuality.|$|E
25|$|When asleep, {{a person}} is unable to <b>make</b> <b>judgments</b> as they do when they are awake Due to the senses not {{functioning}} normally during sleep, {{they are unable to}} help a person judge what is happening in their dream. This in turn leads the person to believe the dream is real. Dreams may be absurd in nature but the senses are not able to discern whether they are real or not. So, the dreamer is left to accept the dream because they lack the choice to judge it.|$|E

25|$|Convergent {{thinking}} is also linked to knowledge as it involves manipulating existing knowledge {{by means of}} standard procedures. Knowledge is another important aspect of creativity. It {{is a source of}} ideas, suggests pathways to solutions, and provides criteria of effectiveness and novelty. Convergent {{thinking is}} used as a tool in creative problem solving. When an individual is using critical thinking to solve a problem they consciously use standards or probabilities to <b>make</b> <b>judgments.</b> This contrasts with divergent thinking where judgment is deferred while looking for and accepting many possible solutions.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of Autonomy {{is the ability}} of an individual to make a rational, un-influenced decision. Therefore, {{it can be said that}} autonomy is a general indicator of health. The progression of many terminal diseases are characterized by loss of autonomy, in various manners. For example, dementia almost always results in the loss of autonomy. Dementia is a chronic and progressive disease that attacks the brain and affects the ability to <b>make</b> <b>judgments,</b> can induce memory loss, cause a decrease in rational thinking and affect orientation. This makes autonomy an indicator for both personal well-being, and for the well-being of the profession.|$|E
25|$|According to Kant, {{we think}} of {{ourselves}} as having free will. This lets us <b>make</b> <b>judgments</b> such as “you ought to have done that thing that you did not do.” Kant argues that this notion of freedom cannot be derived from our experience. We can be sure that this concept of freedom doesn't come from experience because experience itself contradicts it. Our experience is of everything in the sensible world and in the sensible world, everything that happens does so in accord with the laws of nature and {{there is no room for}} a free will to influence events.|$|E

25|$|It is {{expected}} {{for children to}} develop gender-typed behavioural cues given that children often use gender-related information to <b>make</b> <b>judgments.</b> Society often rewards shared traditional behaviours, especially for men, and thus having progressed to a cross-gender development can lead to unwanted criticisms and punishment. Therefore, when children undergo atypical gender development, due to both genetic and environmental contributors, it can drastically alter normal development from a person’s sense of self-worth, self-esteem, to feelings of acceptance. When the child identifies as the opposite sex, {{he or she is}} then diagnosed with gender dysphoria (often termed gender identity disorder or GID).|$|E

Upon the stool, the Chief is sacred, the holy intermediary between people and ancestors. His powers theoretically are more apparent than real. His powers hinge on his attention to the advice and decisions of the Council of Elders. The chief can be impeached, de-stooled, if the Elders and the people turn against him. He can be reduced to man, subject to derision for his failure.|$|E

The Prince was being treated for breathing, kidney, and heart trouble. On 31 March 2005, the Palace of Monaco announced that Hereditary Prince Albert would take over the duties of his father as regent since Rainier was no longer able to exercise his functions as sovereign. This decision was reached by the Crown Council of Monaco, a body made up of notable local figures with residual powers to <b>make</b> <b>judgments</b> about certain constitutional matters.

25|$|There is also {{a drastic}} lack of {{education}} given to governments, farmers, and the community about the science behind GM crops, as well as suitable growing practices. In most relief programs, farmers are given seeds with little explanation and little {{attention is paid to}} the resources available to them or even laws that prohibit them from distributing produce. Governments are often not advised on the economic and health implications that come with growing GM crops, and are then left to <b>make</b> <b>judgments</b> on their own. Because they have so little information regarding these crops, they usually shy away from allowing them or do not take the time and effort required to regulate their use. Members of the community that will then consume the produce from these crops are also left in the dark about what these modifications mean and are often scared off by their 'unnatural' origins. This has resulted in failure to properly grow crops as well as strong opposition to the unknown practices.|$|E

500|$|Not {{everything}} she encounters is beautiful, however, and she juxtaposes her distaste for the German working class with her delight with French servants. Although politically liberal, Mary Shelley is aesthetically repelled by the Germans and therefore excludes them. Unlike the non-discriminating Claire Clairmont, Shelley feels free to <b>make</b> <b>judgments</b> {{of the scenes}} around her; Shelley writes that Claire [...] "on looking at this scene...exclaimed, 'Oh! this is beautiful enough; let us live here.' This was her exclamation on every new scene, and as each surpassed the one before, she cried, 'I am glad we did not stay at Charenton, but let us live here'". Shelley also compares herself positively to the French peasants who are unaware that Napoleon has been deposed.

40|$|The {{ability to}} <b>make</b> reality-status <b>judgments</b> {{requires}} {{an individual to}} distinguish between what is real and what is fantasy. While researchers have explored how this ability develops in typically developing (TD) children and adults, there is a paucity of literature that examines factors that influence the ability to <b>make</b> reality-status <b>judgments.</b> However, new directions include the role of affect, context, evidence, language ability and false-belief These new directions will be explored in TD children and adults across 5 experiments. Furthermore, when considering the role of false-belief, this raises the question ofhow children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), who have difficulty in understanding false-beliefs, <b>make</b> reality-status <b>judgments.</b> In an exploratory experiment, we aim to see whether children with ASD <b>make</b> reality-status <b>judgments</b> differently to TD children. Our research aims to explore what influences how TD children, children with ASD and adults <b>make</b> reality¬status <b>judgments.</b> Across 6 experiments we showed that affect, evidence and context (both local and between- and within-world) all {{play a role in}} children's reality-status judgments that show clear developmental progression. In one of the experiments, we additionally show that children with ASD show similar patterns of response to matched TD children, though they differ in their justifications. The implications of these findings are a) the potential role of affect in children's decision-making and b) the use of context and evidence as part of children's early years learning...|$|R

40|$|In {{contemporary}} moral psychology, an often-heard {{claim is}} that knowing how we <b>make</b> moral <b>judgments</b> {{can help us}} <b>make</b> better moral <b>judgments.</b> Discussions about moral development and improvement are often framed {{in terms of the}} question of which mental processes {{have a better chance of}} leading to good moral judgments. However, few studies elaborate on the question of what <b>makes</b> a moral <b>judgment</b> a good moral judgment. This article examines what is needed to answer questions of moral improvement and development. It distinguishes 3 types of claims that are at stake: descriptive claims, metaethical claims, and normative claims. To find out what <b>makes</b> certain moral <b>judgments</b> better than others, one needs to have insight in the psychological processes and capacities underlying moral judgment formation. However, one also needs to address the question of what <b>makes</b> a moral <b>judgment</b> justified, and this in turn requires a view on the nature of moral goodness and on the question of what <b>makes</b> a <b>judgment</b> moral at all. The author discusses possible ways in which philosophical theories in the areas of metaethics and normative ethics can contribute to the answering of such questions. Also, she provides concrete suggestions for doing interdisciplinary research that is able to address those questions in moral psychology that have both normative and descriptive aspects...|$|R
