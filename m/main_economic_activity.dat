25|$|El Quirambal {{is located}} between the {{municipal}} seat and Escanela.

25|$|After the Mexican War of Independence, Tláhuac {{became part}} of the State of Mexico.

Agriculture remained the <b>main</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> In the late 19th century, the Santa Fe hacienda was known for its cattle {{and the size of the}} vegetables grown there. In 1856, the Mexico City-Tlahuac causeway flooded completely. In 1895, a project was started to drain Lake Chalco. Soon after, the Chalco-Tlaltenco road was constructed over the former lake bed, followed by a rail line that passed through half of the current territory of the borough. In the latter 19th century, steamships traveling between Mexico City and Chalco passed by.|$|E

The Ministry of Defence estate and facilities are managed by the infrastructure support provider Interserve Defence. Serco runs the airport services and Sodexo provides catering and domestic facilities. A former feature of Ascension was a 70,000 tonne tanker permanently moored offshore that was operated by Maersk as a bulk fuel facility. In December 2002, this was replaced by an on-shore Petroleum Supply Depot under military management, with fuel still being delivered by a chartered tanker, the Maersk Rapier, which operates on an MOD resupply contract for both Ascension and the Falkland Islands every two months. Fuel for the island is transferred via a floating hose, which {{is connected to the}} on-shore depot at the island's pier head and to the ship at anchor.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of gold {{was met with}} great enthusiasm by Portugal, which had an economy in disarray following years of wars against Spain and the Netherlands. A gold rush quickly ensued, with people {{from other parts of}} the colony and Portugal flooding the region in the first half of the 18th century. The large portion of the Brazilian inland where gold was extracted became known as the Minas Gerais (General Mines). Gold mining in this area became the <b>main</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> of colonial Brazil during the 18th century. In Portugal, the gold was mainly used to pay for industrialized goods (textiles, weapons) obtained from countries like England and, especially during the reign of King John V, to build magnificent Baroque monuments like the Convent of Mafra. Apart from gold, diamond deposits were also found in 1729 around the village of Tijuco, now Diamantina. A famous figure in Brazilian history of this era was Xica da Silva, a slave woman who had a long term relationship in Diamantina with a Portuguese official; the couple had thirteen children and she died a rich woman. She has been the subject of a Brazilian feature film by Carlos Diegues, Xica and a telenovela Xica da Silva.|$|E
