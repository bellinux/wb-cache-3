5|$|Fossorial creatures live in {{subterranean}} environments. Many fossorial mammals {{were classified}} under the, now obsolete, order Insectivora, such as shrews, hedgehogs and moles. Fossorial mammals have a fusiform body, thickest at {{the shoulders and}} tapering off at the tail and nose. Unable {{to see in the}} dark burrows, most have degenerated eyes, but degeneration varies between species; pocket gophers, for example, are only semi-fossorial and have very small yet functional eyes, in the fully fossorial <b>marsupial</b> <b>mole</b> the eyes are degenerated and useless, talpa moles have vestigial eyes and the cape golden mole has a layer of skin covering the eyes. External ears flaps are also very small or absent. Truly fossorial mammals have short, stout legs as strength is more important than speed to a burrowing mammal, but semi-fossorial mammals have cursorial legs. The front paws are broad and have strong claws to help in loosening dirt while excavating burrows, and the back paws have webbing, as well as claws, which aids in throwing loosened dirt backwards. Most have large incisors to prevent dirt from flying into their mouth.|$|E

25|$|Some animals {{move through}} solids such as soil by {{burrowing}} using peristalsis, as in earthworms, or other methods. In loose solids such as sand some animals, {{such as the}} golden mole, <b>marsupial</b> <b>mole,</b> and the pink fairy armadillo, are able to move more rapidly, 'swimming' through the loose substrate. Burrowing animals include moles, ground squirrels, naked mole-rats, tilefish, and mole crickets.|$|E
40|$|<b>Marsupial</b> <b>moles</b> (genus Notoryctes) are {{the most}} highly {{specialised}} burrowing marsupials. The specialisations of the appendicular musculo-skeletal system of the <b>marsupial</b> <b>moles</b> are extensive and widespread; the major alterations are concentrated in, but not restricted to, the forelimb. Many of the derived features of the muscular system appear to be adaptations for improving the mechanical advantage of the limbs for burrowing. A number of the specialisations of the muscular system of the <b>marsupial</b> <b>moles</b> are convergent with those previously documented in other fossorial mammals, including golden moles, rodents and armadillos. There are, however, a number of unique specialisations of the musculo-skeletal system of Notoryctes. The functional morphology of the locomotor apparatus of <b>marsupial</b> <b>moles</b> is interpreted {{on the basis of}} the descriptions of the anatomy of the skeletal and muscular systems. The burrowing technique of the <b>marsupial</b> <b>moles</b> is a modified form of the parasagittal digging method that is used by other fossorial mammals, such as golden moles, armadillos and some rodents including pocket gophers. Differences in the functional morphology of the hindlimb between <b>marsupial</b> <b>moles</b> and other fossorial mammals are a reflection of the fact that <b>marsupial</b> <b>moles</b> do not construct permanent open burrow systems, but instead constantly dig through loose soil, backfilling as they progress. The functional morphology of the tail is uniquely specialised in the <b>marsupial</b> <b>moles</b> to function as the fifth limb during the pentapedal burrowing locomotion of <b>marsupial</b> <b>moles.</b> Phylogenetic affinities of <b>marsupial</b> <b>moles</b> within the Marsupialia have long been enigmatic. While specialisation of the musculo-skeletal system have been so widespread as to obscure almost any phylogenetically relevant patterns, there is some evidence to support an association between notoryctids and peramelid bandicoots. Interspecific differences between the two species of <b>marsupial</b> <b>moles,</b> Notoryctes typhlops and N. caurinus, are minor...|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{on the basis of}} morphological evidence that they may still be extant in the form of <b>marsupial</b> <b>moles.</b> However, a molecular study places <b>marsupial</b> <b>moles</b> within Euaustralidelphia, though several problems with this assessment have been addressed.|$|R

50|$|Historical records {{suggest that}} the {{southern}} <b>marsupial</b> <b>mole</b> was relatively common in the late 19th century and early 20th century. There was a large trade in <b>marsupial</b> <b>mole</b> skins in the Flike River region between 1900 and 1920. Large numbers of aborigines arrived at the trading post with 5-6 pelts each for sale to trade for food and other commodities. It is estimated that hundreds to several thousand skins were traded at these meetings, and {{that at the time}} the mole was relatively common.|$|E

50|$|Unlike other <b>{{marsupial}}s,</b> <b>marsupial</b> <b>moles</b> have a true cloaca, a {{fact that}} has been argued against a marsupial identity for these mammals.|$|R
50|$|However, a {{more recent}} study showscases that it lacked many of the synapomorphies {{associated}} with <b>marsupial</b> <b>moles,</b> and may belong to a previously unknown lineage of metatherians.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, {{molecular}} data suggests that Notoryctemorphia separated from other marsupials around 64 million years ago. Although {{at this time}} South America, Antarctica and Australia were still joined the order evolved in Australia for at least 40-50 million years. The Riversleigh fossil material suggests that Notoryctes was already well adapted for burrowing and probably lived in the rainforest that covered much of Australia at that time. The increase in aridity {{at the end of}} Tertiary was likely one of the key contributing factors {{to the development of the}} current highly specialized form of <b>marsupial</b> <b>mole.</b> The <b>marsupial</b> <b>mole</b> had been burrowing long before the Australian deserts came into being.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>marsupial</b> <b>mole</b> {{resembles the}} Namib Desert golden mole and other specialized fossorial animals {{in having a}} low and unstable body temperature, ranging between 15-30 Â°C. It {{does not have an}} unusually low resting metabolic rate, and the metabolic rate of burrowing is 60 times higher than that of walking or running. Because it lives underground, where the temperature is considerably lower than at the surface, the southern <b>marsupial</b> <b>mole</b> {{does not seem to have}} any special adaptations to desert life. It is not known whether it drinks water or not, but due to the infrequence of rain it is assumed that it does not.|$|E
50|$|Several {{threatened}} {{species of birds}} and other animals have been recorded on Newhaven. These include the grey falcon, night parrot, princess parrot, striated grasswren, grey honeyeater, mulgara, black-flanked rock-wallaby, greater bilby, <b>marsupial</b> <b>mole</b> and great desert skink.|$|E
50|$|Most marsupials, {{except for}} the two largest species of {{kangaroos}} and <b>marsupial</b> <b>moles</b> (assuming the latter are true marsupials), have a bifurcated penis, separated into two columns, so that the penis has two ends corresponding to the females' two vaginas.|$|R
50|$|A {{morphological}} {{study has}} suggested that <b>marsupial</b> <b>moles</b> might be living meridiolestidans rather than marsupials, noting inconsistency in genetic studies as well as morphological nigh-similarity with Necrolestes. This same study also claims Yalkaparidon is a meridiolestidan, albeit not exploring this in depth.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the lack}} of any field studies {{regarding}} the <b>marsupial</b> <b>moles,</b> there is little known about their behavior. Observations of captive animals are limited since most of the moles do not survive more than a little over a month after capture.|$|R
50|$|Animals {{occurring}} in the region include feral camels, dingos, goannas (including the large perentie) and numerous species of lizard and birds. Other animal inhabitants include bilbies, mulgara, <b>marsupial</b> <b>mole,</b> rufous hare-wallaby, thorny devils, bearded dragons, and the red kangaroo.|$|E
50|$|Leonardus is an extinct mammal genus {{from the}} Late Cretaceous (Late Santonian to Maastrichtian) of South America. It is a meridiolestidan dryolestoid, {{closely related to}} the also Late Cretaceous Cronopio and the Miocene Necrolestes, and {{potentially}} also modern <b>marsupial</b> <b>mole.</b>|$|E
50|$|The mulgara, {{the only}} mammal listed as vulnerable, is mostly {{restricted}} to the transitional sand plain area, a narrow band of country that stretches from the vicinity of Uluru to the northern boundary {{of the park and}} into Ayers Rock Resort.

50|$|Biomixing {{refers to}} the kind of soil bioturbations {{typically}} caused by surface-, shallow-, and intermediate-burrowing vertebrates, such as rodents (pocket gophers, tuco-tucos, mole-rats), insectivores (moles), mustelids (badgers), canids (wolves, coyotes, foxes), <b>marsupials</b> (<b>marsupial</b> <b>moles,</b> wombats), aardvarks, armadillos, pigs, and other similar organisms. Though animal bioturbations are dominant, tree uprooting is still an important process.|$|R
50|$|Golden moles {{are common}} {{throughout}} southern Africa. There are 7 genera and 18 species known. They {{appear in the}} Talpidae (true <b>moles)</b> and Notoryctidae (<b>marsupial</b> <b>moles).</b> Two subfamilies may be recognized: the Chrysochlorinae, in which the malleus bone {{of the middle ear}} is enlarged with a spherical or club-like shape and the Amblysominae, in which the malleus is not expanded and has the typical mammalian shape (i.e. Amblysomus).|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>marsupial</b> <b>mole</b> (Notoryctes typhlops) is a mole-like marsupial {{found in}} the western central deserts of Australia. It is extremely adapted to a burrowing way of life. It has large, shovel-like forepaws and silky fur, which helps it move easily. also lacks complete eyes as it has little need for them. It feeds on earthworms and larvae.|$|E
50|$|The mulgara, {{the only}} mammal listed as vulnerable, is mostly {{restricted}} to the transitional sandplain area, a narrow band of country that stretches from the vicinity of Uluru, to the northern boundary of the park, and into Ayers Rock Resort.

5000|$|The order Dasyuromorphia (meaning [...] "hairy tail") {{comprises}} {{most of the}} Australian carnivorous marsupials, including quolls, dunnarts, the numbat, the Tasmanian devil, and the thylacine. In Australia, {{the exceptions}} include the omnivorous bandicoots (order Peramelemorphia) and the <b>marsupial</b> <b>moles</b> (which eat meat but are very different and are now accorded an order of their own, Notoryctemorphia). Numerous South American species of marsupials (orders Didelphimorphia, Paucituberculata, and Microbiotheria) are also carnivorous.|$|R
50|$|Like most {{burrowing}} mammals {{with similar}} habits, the Chrysochloridae have short legs with powerful digging claws, very dense fur that repels dirt and moisture, and toughened skin, {{particularly on the}} head. Their eyes are non-functional and covered with furred skin. The external ears are just tiny openings. In particular, golden moles bear a remarkable resemblance to the <b>marsupial</b> <b>moles</b> of Australia, family Notoryctidae, which they resemble so suggestively that at one time, the marsupial/placental divide notwithstanding, some workers argued that they were related. Considerations that influenced the debate might have included {{the view that the}} Chrysochloridae are very primitive placentals {{and the fact that they}} have many mole-like specializations similar to specializations in marsupial moles.The rhinarium is a greatly enlarged, dry leathery pad that protects their nostrils while the animal digs. In this respect too, they resemble the <b>marsupial</b> <b>moles.</b> Some authors claim that their primary sense is that of touch, and they are particularly sensitive to vibrations that may indicate approaching danger. Note below however, the observations on the malleus in the middle ear.|$|R
40|$|<b>MARSUPIAL</b> <b>moles</b> (Notoryctes spp.) remain one of {{the great}} enigmas of the Australian fauna.

Their small size, cryptic habits, remote distribution and wariness have led to few reported sightings. In addition, the difficulty of keeping captive Notoryctes has restricted the collection of basic biological information (How...|$|R
