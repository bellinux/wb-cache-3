50|$|This melaleuca is {{regarded}} as a serious environmental weed in some locations especially in Victoria. It replaces local species and increases fuel loads <b>making</b> <b>areas</b> more prone to bushfires. After a bushfire, the problem is increased because of the plants' releasing large numbers of seeds after fire. In South Australia, it is a problem in the Mount Lofty Ranges, Adelaide Hills, and Kangaroo Island. In Western Australia, the problems occur in coastal areas of the south-west of that state.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} VSA {{proposal is}} represented in the following figure, derived from Beer's first conceptualization of the decision <b>making</b> <b>area</b> and operating structure. Basically, VSA advances upon Stafford Beer's proposal, based upon the distribution of numerous managerial and operative decisions within the operating structure area. The management system can limit the real decision making to strategic and high level issues, involving every decision maker. In a similar way, we may say that the operating area {{of a human being}} involves the decision of going to jog, requiring the person to wear a sport outfit and running shoes; on the other hand, the decision about pursuing higher education, starting a new venture, or practicing within an existing business, may be relegated within the higher control system.|$|E
5000|$|Chiocchio is {{a village}} (frazione) of the comune of Greve in Chianti, Italy. It is located 7.7 km by road {{north of the}} town of Greve in Chianti. Population 592 (2001).

50|$|Less {{controlling}} {{than the}} exploitative authoritative system, under this system motivation {{is based on}} the potential for punishment and partially on rewards. The decision <b>making</b> <b>area</b> is expanded by allowing lower-level employees to be involved in policy-making but is limited by the framework given to them from upper-level management. Major policy decisions are still left to those at the top, who have some awareness of the problems that occur at lower levels. This creates mainly downward communication from supervisors to employees with little upward communication, causing subordinates to be somewhat suspicious of communication coming from the top. The managers at the top feel more responsibility towards organizational goals than those employees at the bottom, who feel very little responsibility. This contrast in feelings toward responsibility can result in a conflict and negative attitudes with the organization's goals. Subordinates in this system can become hostile towards each other because of the competition that is created between them. Satisfaction among workers is low to moderately-low and productivity is measured at fair to good.|$|E

5000|$|This {{practice}} was implemented {{on a large}} scale in Washington, D.C. and its suburbs in Maryland and Virginia. Until 1991, the entire region was a single local calling area, and it was possible for anyone living in the metro area to dial a number in D.C. or the Maryland and Virginia suburbs with only seven digits. This setup was possible because the entire Washington metropolitan area is a single local access and transport area (LATA). Every number in Maryland's area code 301 and northern Virginia's 703 was given a [...] "hidden" [...] phone number consisting of the same number in the D.C.'s area code 202, essentially <b>making</b> <b>area</b> code 202 an overlay for the entire region. This meant a Virginia number, such as 703-931-xxxx, could also have been dialed as 202-931-xxxx, while a Maryland number, such as 301-585-xxxx, could also be dialed as 202-585-xxxx. However, this meant that a central office code could only be duplicated in areas a safe distance from the metro area such as southwestern Virginia or the Eastern Shore of Maryland. By 1991 the use of 202 as a de facto overlay was discontinued due to growing demand for numbers, and callers in the area dialing an out-of-area-code number had to dial the full 10 digit number.|$|E
