5|$|The {{first film}} {{screening}} in Turkey was at Yıldız Palace in 1896, {{a year after}} the technology publicly debuted in Paris. Movie theaters rapidly cropped up in Beyoğlu, with the greatest concentration of theaters being along the street now known as İstiklal Avenue. Istanbul also became the heart of Turkey's nascent film industry, although Turkish films were not consistently developed until the 1950s. Since then, Istanbul has been the most popular location to film Turkish dramas and comedies. The Turkish film industry ramped up {{in the second half of}} the century, and with Uzak (2002) and <b>My</b> <b>Father</b> <b>and</b> <b>My</b> Son (2005), both filmed in Istanbul, the nation's movies began to see substantial international success. Istanbul and its picturesque skyline have also served as a backdrop for several foreign films, including Topkapi (1964), The World Is Not Enough (1999), and Mission Istaanbul (2008).|$|E

25|$|Yeşilçam {{suffered}} due to {{the spread}} of television and the widespread political violence {{at the end of the}} 1970s. Yeşilçam totally ended after the 1980 Turkish coup d'état.

2500|$|Sauron {{was killed}} again by Gil-galad and Elendil {{at the end}} of the Last Alliance. The Ring was cut from Sauron's hand by Elendil's son, Isildur, on the slopes of Mount Doom. Though counselled to destroy the Ring, he was swayed by its power and kept it safe instead, [...] "as weregild for <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> brother". [...] A few years later, Isildur was ambushed by orcs by the River Anduin near the Gladden Fields; he put on the Ring to escape, but it slipped from his finger as he swam across the river, and, {{suddenly}} visible, he was killed by the orcs. Since the Ring indirectly caused Isildur's death, it was known in Gondorian lore as [...] "Isildur's Bane".|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, in November 2004 {{an issue}} of Point de Vue had {{announced}} that henceforth the magazine would accord the Bonapartist title of pretence, [...] "the Prince Napoleon", to Jean-Christophe, whereas since 1997 that title had been attributed to Charles. This decision followed receipt by the magazine of a protest from Jean-Marc Varaut, prompted by publication in an earlier issue of a reference to Charles as [...] "head of the Imperial house". Point de Vue, which sometimes gazettes monarchist announcements, published Varaut's re-assertion of the dynastic exclusion of Charles along with the prince's response: [...] "...the title of 'head of family' among the Bonapartes devolves, at {{the death of the}} father, upon his eldest son. That rule is not susceptible to modification by the titleholder, a fortiori when the motives involved are petty and contrary to the Civil Code. I have the honour of bearing this charge since the death of <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> son will assume it in turn upon my death." ...|$|E

As was acknowledged by both parties, Carolyn had to physically force her to leave the FLDS when she was thirteen. Since returning to the FLDS, Betty has openly disputed the claims in Carolyn's book, particularly those alleging that Merril Jessop was abusive, saying [...] "it just makes me want to laugh." [...] She describes her years outside of the sect as traumatic, explaining that public school was a shock and that the task of caring for her siblings fell to her due to her mother's health problems: [...] "With the responsibility landing on me so hard every morning, I was an emotional wreck, and after a while, I hardened into a frazzled bundle of nerves." [...] She added, [...] "I was such a representation of everything [...] hated so much. I just couldn't deny what was in my heart -- my belief in my religion and my love for <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> family. I spent four years , and there is nothing there for me." ...|$|E

[...] According to La Toya, Michael knew that she was forced to attack him in the press against her will and he did not blame her. [...] "He never held any of that against me, I remember when I'd got away from this total hell I'd been through where I'd been beaten, abused, controlled and forced to say those terrible things about Michael, which I didn't for a moment believe, he held out his arms and just hugged me.
