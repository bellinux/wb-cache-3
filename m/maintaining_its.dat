5|$|After <b>maintaining</b> <b>its</b> {{intensity}} for 24 hours, Rachel made landfall at {{peak intensity}} near {{the southern tip}} of Baja California Sur. Strong wind shear prevented additional intensification, despite moving into the warm waters of the Gulf of California. After weakening slightly, Rachel made a second landfall midway between Las Mochis and Culiacán. Upon moving inland, the system rapidly weakened as the forward speed increased. Rachel dissipated several hours later on October3. By that time, the winds had decreased to 30mph (45km/h). The remnants of Rachel entered the United States, and were last noted over Texas.|$|E

5|$|The storm's {{convection}} {{organized around}} a central core, {{and the system}} became a tropical storm on November23 and received the name Delta. An eye-like feature appeared near the storm's circulatory center several times that day. The larger-scale deep-layered cyclonic circulation within which it was embedded steered it on a slow southward and then south-southwesterly track. Strong wind shear prevented immediate development and the system added an eastward component to its drift. Moving out of the high-shear environment on November24, Delta gained organization. Outflow and convective banding increased and an eye feature became well defined. This eye signaled the storm's peak strength of 70mph (110km/h), just below hurricane status. However, the official forecast at the time predicted Delta to strengthen further and become a minimal hurricane. Delta's motion stalled as it reached the southern base of a large cyclonic trough over the northern Atlantic within which it was embedded. <b>Maintaining</b> <b>its</b> intensity, Delta remained motionless for half a day until, that evening when it began a slow southward drift at 6mph (9km/h). <b>Maintaining</b> <b>its</b> intensity, Delta remained motionless for half a day Convection broke down in the storm's western semicircle early on November25; the decreased organization caused slight weakening. <b>Maintaining</b> <b>its</b> intensity, Delta remained motionless for half a day The southward motion slowed and the weakening trend continued into the evening. Cooling cold tops were counteracted by wind shear which exposed most of the low-level center. The storm's southward motion stopped and it began moving east at 6mph (9km/h). Some of the computer models suggested the weakening tropical storm could be absorbed by a developing low to the west, which {{a few days later}} became Hurricane Epsilon. This did not occur, and Tropical Storm Delta began to move to the northeast.|$|E
5|$|This {{tropical}} storm was previously unidentified {{and was not}} considered a {{tropical storm}} until research by José Fernández-Partagás in 1997. The storm {{is believed to have}} originated west of the Canary Islands in the northeastern Atlantic on September 22. The tropical storm moved west-southwestward for several days, <b>maintaining</b> <b>its</b> peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h); however, the storm began to curve early on September 26 and traveled directly westward before curving northward during the afternoon. The tropical storm continued to change course, turning west-northwestward by September 28. The transitioned to an extratropical system on October 1, and reached England on October 3.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{situation}} in the North Sea in late 1918 remained much as it had been for the previous four years—with the Grand Fleet <b>maintaining</b> <b>its</b> endless watch over the High Seas Fleet—the war on the Western Front was rapidly drawing to a close. Operation Michael, the last German offensive, had been stopped in late summer, and with the aid {{of hundreds of thousands of}} American doughboys, the Allies had begun to overwhelm the German Army. On 3 October, Prince Max of Baden replaced Georg von Hertling as Chancellor of Germany, and immediately asked President Woodrow Wilson to arrange an armistice.|$|E
5|$|When {{the medieval}} churches of Kiev were rebuilt {{in the late}} seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries in the Ukrainian Baroque style, the cathedral was {{enlarged}} and renovated dramatically.

Six domes {{were added to the}} original single dome, but the added pressure on the walls was counteracted by the construction of buttresses. The remaining medieval walls, characterised by alternative layers of limestone and flat brick, were covered with stucco. Ivan Hryhorovych-Barskyi was responsible for window surrounds and stucco ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm {{was present in}} the east-central Atlantic on October17. It moved northwestward at first before turning to the northeast on October19, when it was already a small, compact tropical cyclone. The storm steadily intensified as it tracked toward the Azores, and it reached a peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h) on October21. <b>Maintaining</b> <b>its</b> peak strength for 30hours, the storm began a steady weakening trend before crossing through the southern Azores. It turned to the southeast, weakening to tropical depression status on October24. Subsequently, the system turned {{to the south and}} quickly dissipated. This {{tropical storm}} {{was not included in the}} Monthly Weather Reviews summary of the 1950 hurricane season, and it was added to the Atlantic hurricane database in 1959.|$|E

5|$|After <b>maintaining</b> <b>its</b> peak {{intensity}} for about 24hours, Kyle began weakening on September27 as increased upper-level shear restricted outflow and distorted the convection envelope; drier air {{also contributed to}} the weakening. On September 28, after turning west-northwestward, the hurricane weakened to tropical storm status, and by the next day the center had become devoid of deep convection. A trough passing to its north and a developing ridge to its west left the storm nearly stationary for several days. The weakening rate of Kyle was temporarily halted when thunderstorms redeveloped on September29 and again early the next day, though late on September30 the storm weakened to tropical depression status. The circulation had become elongated from northeast to southwest. The northeastern portion became associated with the approaching frontal zone, and was briefly monitored for signs of development. However, the southwestern portion redeveloped convection and became the dominant circulation.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from its}} vertebrae, Acrocanthosaurus had a typical allosauroid skeleton. Acrocanthosaurus was bipedal, with a long, heavy tail {{counterbalancing}} {{the head and}} body, <b>maintaining</b> <b>its</b> center of gravity over its hips. Its forelimbs were relatively shorter and more robust than those of Allosaurus but were otherwise similar: each hand bore three clawed digits. Unlike many smaller fast-running dinosaurs, its femur was longer than its tibia and metatarsals, suggesting that Acrocanthosaurus was not a fast runner. Unsurprisingly, the hind leg bones of Acrocanthosaurus were proportionally more robust than its smaller relative Allosaurus. Its feet had four digits each, although as is typical for theropods, the first was {{much smaller than the}} rest and did not make contact with the ground.|$|E
5|$|Early on September1, Hurricane Luis {{strengthened}} into a Category3 hurricane with {{winds of}} 115mph (185km/h); upper-level outflow continued to improve throughout the day, allowing further intensification. <b>Maintaining</b> <b>its</b> structure, Luis further intensified to a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 135mph (215km/h). Subsequent to doing so, its intensity remained steady for 42hours while it tracked nearly due west. Early on September3, satellite intensity estimates {{indicated that the}} storm strengthened slightly, attaining its peak winds of 140mph (220km/h) at around 0600UTC. Continuing on a westward track, the forward motion of the hurricane decreased to 13mph (20km/h) later on September3. When Luis was about 690mi (1,110km) east of the Lesser Antilles, a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance flight into the storm confirmed satellite intensity estimates. Flight level winds around the eye of Luis were recorded at 165mph (270km/h), which corresponds to surface winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 944mbar (27.87inHg).|$|E

5|$|<b>Maintaining</b> <b>its</b> peak {{intensity}} {{for over a}} day, the hurricane gradually slowed its forward motion and weakened. By September13, Debbie's motion became influenced by the Westerlies, causing the system to accelerate east-northeastward. The system passed over the western Azores as a minimal hurricane on September15. At this point, there is uncertainty as {{to the structure of}} Debbie, whether it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone or maintained its identity as a tropical system. Regardless of which took place, the system deepened as it neared Ireland, skirting the coast of Western Ireland on September16. Shortly thereafter, the system was confirmed to have become extratropical as it continued towards the northeast. The remnants of the storm later turned eastward, striking Norway and Russia, before dissipating on September19.|$|E
5|$|On May 16, {{the first}} {{tropical}} {{depression of the}} season formed to the southwest of Baja California, out of a tropical disturbance that had developed during May 5 within the vicinity of Panama. During May 16 the depression gradually developed, before early {{the next day the}} National Hurricane Centre declared it a tropical storm and named it Andres. The newly named tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity of 60mph (95km/h), later that day. After <b>maintaining</b> <b>its</b> peak intensity for 24 hours, Andres started to gradually weaken as upper level windshear over the system increased before it dissipated during May 20. Throughout its life as a tropical cyclone, Andres moved very little and slowly executed a cyclonic loop, while remaining well away from any land.|$|E
