Some IDBs may also have other duties, powers and responsibilities under specific legislation for the district (for instance the Middle Level Commissioners are also a navigation authority). IDBs are responsible to Defra from whom all legislation/regulations affecting them are issued. The work of an IDB is closely linked with that of the Environment Agency which has a range of functions providing a supervisory role over them.|$|E

2500|$|The third {{aspect of}} Alfred's society is the working man. Helena Hamerow suggest the {{prevailing}} model of working life and settlement, {{particularly for the}} early period, as one of shifting settlement and building tribal kinship. The mid-Saxon period saw diversification, the development of enclosures, {{the beginning of the}} toft system, closer management of livestock, the gradual spread of the mould-board plough, 'informally regular plots' and a greater permanence, with further settlement consolidation thereafter foreshadowing post-Conquest villages. The later periods saw a proliferation of 'service features' including barns, mills and latrines, most markedly on high-status sites. Throughout the Anglo-Saxon period as Helena Hamerow suggests: [...] "local and extended kin groups remained...the essential unit of production". This is very noticeable in the early period. However, by the tenth and eleventh centuries, the rise of the manor and its significance in terms of both settlement and the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> which becomes very evident in the Domesday Book.|$|E

Using the theoretical and empirical literature on planning, this article considers institutional arrangements and processes to support the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> indigenous <b>lands</b> by their indigenous owners. The article examines recent calls for policy decentralization and community-based planning {{as a response to}} contemporary environmental management issues. The utility of three institutional models [...] (1) centralized institutional regulatory, (2) community-based planning, and (3) reticulist (facilitated process) approaches [...] are interrogated. The article develops a hybrid approach that integrates the positive features of different approaches. The hybridized model provides institutional arrangements that enable collaborative planning between indigenous peoples and state institutions. It overcomes the deficiencies of community-based approaches by retaining an active, albeit limited, role for state agencies. Marcus B. Lan...|$|R
