40|$|Abstract. For {{distributed}} systems, {{the ability}} to accurately monitor the bus traffic is {{required in order to}} enable fault removal and fault forecasting for system verification, enhancement and evaluation. Typically, modern communication systems have high data throughput, and monitoring the bus for hours produces large amounts of data at high rates. In the expected operating environment of the monitoring tool, non-volatile memories are often <b>mandatory</b> as <b>data</b> storage. The required frequent access to these memories, however, results in high processor load. To that aim, this paper presents an approach that illustrates the improvements that can be achieved when several memory access functionalities are transferred from software to hardware. To quantify the results, the different approaches implemented in an FPGA were subjected to an experimental evaluation. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Future {{embedded}} systems {{are expected to}} use chip-multiprocessors to provide the execution power for increasingly demanding applications. Multi-processors increase {{the pressure on the}} memory bandwidth and processor local caching is <b>mandatory.</b> However, <b>data</b> caches are known to be very hard to inte-grate into the worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis. We tackle this issue from the computer architecture side: provide a data cache organization that en-ables tight WCET analysis. Similar to the cache splitting between instruction and data, we argue to split the data cache for different data areas. In this paper we show cache simulation results for the split-cache organization, propose the mod-ularization of the data cache analysis for the different data areas, and evaluate the implementation costs in a prototype chip-multiprocessor system. ...|$|R
