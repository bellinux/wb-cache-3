25|$|<b>MPS</b> <b>II,</b> Hunter {{syndrome}} or iduronate sulfatase deficiency, {{is caused}} by lack of the enzyme iduronate sulfatase. Hunter syndrome has two clinical subtypes and (since it shows X-linked recessive inheritance) {{is the only one}} of the mucopolysaccharidoses in which the mother alone can pass the defective gene to a son.

25|$|When the {{national}} government officially adopted Tongyong Pinyin in 2002, local governments were {{to make their own}} choices. Consequently, Taipei, adopted Hanyu Pinyin. Taipei replaced its earlier signage, most of which had used a modified version of Wade-Giles influenced by the Postal Office. Elsewhere in Taiwan, signs tend to a mix of systems, with Tongyong being common, but still having many signs left over from the <b>MPS</b> <b>II</b> (or even the GR) era.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 1 in 25,000 babies born in the United States will {{have some form of}} the mucopolysaccharidoses. It is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that only individuals inheriting the defective gene from both parents are affected. (The exception is <b>MPS</b> <b>II,</b> or Hunter syndrome, in which the mother alone passes along the defective gene to a son.) When both people in a couple have the defective gene, each pregnancy carries with it a one in four chance that the child will be affected. The parents and siblings of an affected child may have no sign of the disorder. Unaffected siblings and select relatives of a child with one of the mucopolysaccharidoses may carry the recessive gene and could pass it to their own children.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAmphipols (APols) are amphipathic {{polymers}} {{with the}} ability to substitute detergents to keep membrane proteins (MPs) soluble and functional in aqueous solutions. APols also protect MPs against denaturation. Here, we have examined the ability of APol-trapped MPs to be analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS). For that purpose, we have used ionic and non-ionic APols and as model proteins i) the transmembrane domain of Escherichia coli outer membrane protein A, a β barrel, eubacterial <b>MP,</b> <b>ii)</b> Halobacterium salinarum bacteriorhodopsin, an α helical archaebacterial MP with a single cofactor, and iii-iv) two eukaryotic MP complexes comprising multiple subunits and many cofactors, cytochrome b 6 f from the chloroplast of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and cytochrome bc 1 from beef heart mitochondria. We show that these MP/APol complexes can be readily analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS; most of the subunits, some lipids and cofactors were identified. APols alone, even ionic ones, had no deleterious effects on MS signals and were not detected in mass spectra. Thus, the combination of MP stabilization by APols and MS analyses provides an interesting new approach to investigating supramolecular interactions in biological membranes...|$|R

40|$|Formation {{of neural}} {{precursors}} in Drosophila {{is determined by}} proneural genes. The distinctive pattern of expression of some genes of the achaete-scute complex in the embryonic neuroectoderm has prompted the speculation that they could also function in the specification of neural precursor identity in the CNS. To test this hypothesis, we have analysed the capacity of different proneural proteins to promote {{the development of a}} particular CNS precursor, the MP 2 precursor. Our results indicate that: (i) all known proneural proteins are similarly able to support the formation of a neural precursor at the position of <b>MP</b> 2; (<b>ii)</b> different proneural proteins promote the expression of different characteristics of MP 2; and (iii) a totally normal specification of the MP 2 fate can only be attained by the proneural genes achaete or scute...|$|R
