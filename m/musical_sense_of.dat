40|$|Newfoundland {{has been}} {{described}} as “the most Irish place outside of Ireland” (McGinn 2000, 8). As a North Atlantic island and a former British colony, Newfoundland shares many ethnic, geographic and economic similarities with Ireland. The actual musical culture in Newfoundland is a blend of western European immigration and musical technological flows. However, the Irish connection is privileged in discourses of musical cultural heritage. This dissertation examines how interactions both live and meditated by radio, television, and recordings between Irish and Newfoundland musicians have contributed to the construction <b>of</b> <b>musical</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> place as having an Irish foundation. Using three case studies of Irish musicians throughout the 20 th and 21 st centuries, this dissertation examines the construction of Irishness in Newfoundland music, particularly in relation to instrumental (fiddle/accordion) music and musicians. [...] The first case study examines an Irish-American group, The McNulty Family (1920 s- 1960 s). Newfoundland businessman, J. M. Devine (1876 - 1959) both featured them on weekly radio shows (ca. 1944 - 1974) and sponsored their 1953 tour of the island. Their music was heard regularly during the development of the Newfoundland recording industry and was highly influential in the establishment of local recorded repertoire. [...] The second case study examines Ryan’s Fancy, a trio of Irishmen who moved to Newfoundland during the cultural revival of the 1970 s. They became {{an integral part of the}} community and their (inter) national television show (1975 - 1977) highlighted rural Newfoundland musical traditions through a folklore-based documentary approach. [...] The final case study examines the interactions between Irish fiddler Séamus Creagh and local St. John’s instrumentalists from the late 1980 s into the early 21 st century. In 2003, Creagh released a joint CD project entitled Island to Island: Traditional Music from Newfoundland and Ireland. This chapter explores how some St. John’s musicians perceive Irish music in relation to Newfoundland music. [...] This work demonstrates that Irish music introduced by electronic mass media is a major component of the Newfoundland recording repertoire and construction <b>of</b> <b>musical</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> place. However, there is also a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Newfoundland music as a related, but separate, entity.

From that period, he was familiar with Harley Granville-Barker's famous essay arguing that Love's Labour's Lost could be treated as highly stylised, with the dialogue and action treated with an almost <b>musical</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> rhythm. Branagh took this insight a step further and turned the play into a musical, going much further in his adaptation of the play than he had ever done in his Shakespeare films, and risking the alienation of both audiences and serious critics.

50|$|That same evening a Nonetto by Bertini for piano, viola, cello, oboe, flute, horn, bassoon, trumpet and bass, was performed. It is a {{great and}} {{beautiful}} composition in which each instrument contributes to the whole according to its importance and idiomatic qualities, without trying to stand out individually. The piano itself is only entrusted those parts which contribute to the <b>musical</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the moment, and makes no effort toward brilliance for brilliance's sake. Beethoven himself followed this philosophy in his immortal trios. Amongst other movements, this Nonetto includes an adagio entitled La Melancolie which provides more than its title might indicate; it is so grandiose, at times so majestically sombre, that the sentiment of melancholy one expects is overshadowed by ideas of a much higher and rare order. In no way do I mean to quibble with the title, God forbid; all I wish {{to say is that}} this admirable work is not only melancholic, but also much more. In the Scherzo and Finale one finds details of graceful melancholy as well as vivacious charm, but the Adagio rises up in the centre of the work like the Mont Blanc among its neighbouring peaks; it dominates all; it is a sublime and profound meditation which provides an almost painful impression that cannot be forgotten.|$|E

The contour lines played a linking role. The vital element in his art was rhythm, namely the rhythm of colours and lines, and the composition of his pictures was based on these main traits. He consciously endeavoured to obtain musical effects; many of his pictures could have borne the title ‘Improvisation’, also in the <b>musical</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the word.’ In fact, he played the violin and piano wonderfully; as relaxation, {{he was able to}} improvise music for hours. In 1969 with an interview given to Aliz Torday he said the following that can be considered as his ars poetica. He was an artist of few words: ‘For me art is not a logical or speculative world,’ he once declared ‘but is emotional, like poetry. The truth of the artwork is different from everyday truth. At the same time truth - authenticity, in the sense of similitude - is not important. Every work of art has its own laws. The condition for creation is, however, always humane: it comes from a ‘pure wellspring’. He then quotes the classical concept: ‘The picture is always a complete whole.’ One must never take out one part and look at it separately. It is like an orchestral work, in which one does not listen to the instruments separately, but together, and only in this way do they produce the desired effect ... There is no life without music and colour, as the sound and colour are one of the appearing forms of the existence." ...|$|E

Additionally, Schaller was able to supplement archival and manuscript material with missing elements in the score by drawing on his experience as a conductor, and of applying Bruckner’s compositional techniques to the recordings of the complete cycle of all the composer’s eleven symphonies; so that even passages without continuous original material are in a recognisably Brucknerian style.

What differentiated it from punk was its sound: a decidedly pop emphasis on short, melodic song structures and seemingly simple instrumentation. In embracing independent production, indiepop staked a claim for subculture authenticity over the inauthentic mass products of the mainstream music industry.

Furthermore, it is shown that the investigation of musical patterns with which Heraclitus was clearly acquainted offered him a significant analogical ground for his reflection on the order and rationality of kosmos. He was not apparently interested in the numerical definition of musical patterns, and thus {{there is no need to}} assume any influence of earlier Pythagorean research on his theory of cosmic harmony: the other way round, this theory was likely food for thought for Philolaus...|$|E

Jöde's music pedagogy focused on character formation, while Adorno emphasized the specialization of music in his pedagogy. This difference was based on their differing views on the cultivability of music. Second, Jöde and Adorno had differing opinions regarding how students should understand music.
