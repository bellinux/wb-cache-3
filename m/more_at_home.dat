5|$|The {{absence of}} any {{reference}} to a Davidic son-ship in the gospel text suggests that Jesus has been elected to be the end-time prophet, the Chosen One, sent to abolish the Jewish sacrifices. The Prophet-Christology of the gospel text quoted by Epiphanius is <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> with the Clementine literature than the Christology of the Ebionites known to Irenaeus. According to scholars Richard Bauckham and Petri Luomanen, Jesus is understood in this gospel as having come to abolish the sacrifices rather than substituting for them; thus {{it is unlikely that}} it contained the same institution of the Eucharist as practiced by Nicene orthodox Christianity. However, scholars have yet to reach a consensus over the sacrificial significance of Jesus' mission as depicted in the Ebionite gospel.|$|E

He was criticised for his failure to support Indian cricket, and his nephew Duleepsinhji later represented England in Test matches.

25|$|After a {{disastrous}} fire leveled {{much of the}} downtown core in 1904, the fledgling municipal government passed an ordinance requiring all buildings {{in the area to}} be built of 'fireproof' materials like brick and stone. Consequently, a new city centre rose from the ashes sporting brick buildings along broad avenues that would have looked <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in a sedate and refined Victorian city than a rough-and-tumble frontier coal town. They were short-lived, however, as a second, larger inferno swept through the city on August 1, 1908. Whipped up by sudden winds, a nearby forest fire burnt its way into a lumber yard {{on the edge of the}} community and sparked a Dresden-style firestorm that melted brick and mortar and essentially erased the entire city in an afternoon. There were few casualties, however, and for a second time a stately brick downtown core rose from the ashes. Today, these historic buildings, most of which still stand, are a treasured and distinctive feature of the community.|$|E

500|$|As {{with many}} Protestant churches, the General Synod was {{split on the}} issue of the American Civil War in the 1860s.

As the importance of the Lutheran Confessions grew among American Lutherans, Samuel Schmuckerwho was once seen confessionally conservativefound himself on the outside of the consensus of other Lutherans. In 1855, Schmucker, along with two other theologians from the Gettysburg seminary, penned the Definite Synodical Platform.

[...] He and Pollock played a match at the Montreal Chess Club in December 1894 and January 1895; each won six games, with five draws. This was an {{impressive}} result for Gossip [...] "in view of Pollock's undoubted strength". Later in 1895, Pollock finished 19th out of 22 players, scoring 8 out of 21 (including wins over Tarrasch and Steinitz), at Hastings 1895, arguably at that time the strongest tournament in history. Diggle writes that Gossip's drawn match with Pollock vindicates the BCMs 1889 observation that Gossip would be <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in a match than a tournament.|$|E

The couple had three children, but his wife did not enjoy the overseas postings. They divorced in 1984 and Penfold travelled to Kampala alone. While in Uganda, Penfold met his second wife-to-be, Celia, who was working for the World Bank. They married while Penfold was Governor of the British Virgin Islands, making Penfold the first British governor to get married in-post.

500|$|January saw Arsenal's title {{challenge}} falter; {{the team}} {{went on a}} four-match winless run. At home, they only merited draws to Wimbledon, Aston Villa and QPR – the latter two were scoreless. Arsenal were beaten 2–0 by Liverpool on 29 January 1992; journalist Derek Hodgson said this was in spite of playing [...] "crisper" [...] and more confident football. A draw against Manchester United on 1 February 1992 came before a win away to Notts County. A crowd of 22,352 witnessed Arsenal draw once <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> this time against Norwich City. Rockets were launched on the pitch during the match by Arsenal supporters, in protest of the club's bond scheme. Arsenal recorded their biggest win of the season, scoring seven past Sheffield Wednesday, on 15 February 1992. Campbell, who began the match as a substitute, came on and scored two goals; six of Arsenal's goals came in the second half. Arsenal ended February with a 1–1 draw away to Tottenham. After 30 games, the team were in sixth position, 18 points behind Manchester United in first.|$|E

Weiler, writing in The New York Times, praised Grant's performance, remarking that the actor [...] "was never <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> than in this role of the advertising-man-on-the-lam" [...] and handled the role [...] "with professional aplomb and grace". Grant wore one of his most iconic suits in the film which became very popular, a fourteen-gauge, mid-gray, worsted wool one custom-made on Savile Row. Grant finished the year playing a U. S. Navy Rear Admiral aboard a submarine opposite Tony Curtis in the comedy Operation Petticoat. The reviewer from Daily Variety saw Grant's comic portrayal as a classic example of how to attract the laughter of the audience without lines, remarking that [...] "In this film, most of the gags play off him. It is his reaction, blank, startled, etc., always underplayed, that creates or releases the humor". The film was major box office success, and in 1973, Deschner ranked the film as the highest earning film of Grant's career at the US box office, with takings of $9.5 million.|$|E
500|$|The {{historian}} Peter Hunter Blair summarises Wilfrid's life as follows: [...] "Wilfrid left {{a distinctive}} {{mark on the}} character of the English church in the seventh century.

[...] R. W. Southern, another modern historian, says that Wilfrid was [...] "the greatest papal enthusiast of the century". James Campbell, a historian specialising in the Anglo-Saxon period, said of him [...] "He was certainly one of the greatest ecclesiastics of his day. Ascetic, deemed a saint by some, the founder of several monasteries according to the rule of St Benedict, he established Christianity in Sussex and attempted to do so in Frisia. At the same time, his life and conduct were in some respects like those of a great Anglo-Saxon nobleman." ...|$|E
500|$|Sophie Blanchard {{was born}} Marie Madeleine-Sophie Armant to Protestant parents at Trois-Canons, near La Rochelle. Little {{is known of}} her life before her {{marriage}} to Jean-Pierre Blanchard, the world's first professional balloonist. The date of her marriage is unclear; sources quote dates as early as 1794 [...] or 1797, but most state 1804, the year of her first ascent. Blanchard had abandoned his first wife, Victoire Lebrun, and their four children to travel round Europe pursuing his ballooning career, and she later died in poverty. Variously described as Blanchard's [...] "small, ugly, nervous wife", [...] "small with sharp bird-like features" [...] and later as [...] "small and beautiful", Sophie was <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in the sky than on the ground, where her nervous disposition meant she was easily startled. She was terrified of loud noises and of riding in carriages, but was fearless in the air. She {{and her husband were}} in an accident on a joint flight in 1807 (her 11th ascent, possibly his 61st), in which they crashed and he sustained a head injury.

500|$|Critics {{observed}} the film's adherence to {{conventions of the}} spy thriller genre; Ebert called it [...] "a James Bond plot" [...] and David Denby pointed out the [...] "usual tropes of the genre—surveillance shots from drones, S.U.V.s tearing across the desert, explosions, scenes of torture" [...] but praised Scott's superior management of space and timing. While Todd McCarthy in Variety praised the initial set-up and conceit of the plot device, he criticised the formulaic approach leading to a [...] "cornball denouement". A. O. Scott in The New York Times writes that director Scott's [...] "professionalism is, as ever, present in every frame and scene, {{but this time it}} seems singularly untethered from anything like zeal, conviction or even curiosity." [...] Joe Neumaier writes in the New York Daily News that the film [...] "aims to be up-to-the-moment – yet feels same-old, same-old." [...] Kennedy called the love story between DiCaprio and Farahani contrived, saying that while DiCaprio seemed <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in those scenes, it made the film seem [...] "foolish". Ebert thought the cultural context of their relationship was well established, but that it essentially existed as a convenience of the plot, to set up the unlikely conclusion. Scott would have preferred the psychological tensions linking the three leading men were allowed develop further.|$|E
500|$|Nirvana {{released}} its first single, {{a cover of}} Shocking Blue's [...] "Love Buzz", in November 1988 on the Seattle independent record label Sub Pop. They did their first ever interview with John Robb in Sounds [...] who also made the release single of the week. The following month, the band began recording its debut album, Bleach, with local producer Jack Endino. Bleach was highly influenced by the heavy dirge-rock of the Melvins and Mudhoney, 1980s punk rock, and the 1970s heavy metal of Black Sabbath. Novoselic said in a 2001 interview with Rolling Stone that the band had played a tape in their van while on tour that had an album by The Smithereens {{on one side and}} an album by the extreme metal band Celtic Frost on the other, and noted that the combination probably played an influence as well. The money for the recording sessions for Bleach, listed as $606.17 on the album sleeve, was supplied by Jason Everman, who was subsequently brought into the band as the second guitarist. Though Everman did not actually play on the album, he received a credit on Bleach because, according to Novoselic, they [...] "wanted to make him feel <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in the band". Just prior to the album's release, Nirvana insisted on signing an extended contract with Sub Pop, making the band the first to do so with the label.|$|E
500|$|Included on the UK {{edition of}} Are You Experienced were two tracks that {{represented}} the music Hendrix {{had played in}} the US before {{the formation of the}} Experience: the blues track [...] "Red House" [...] and the rhythm and blues song [...] "Remember". The album's psychedelic title track, which author Sean Egan described as impressionistic, featured the post-modern soundscapes of backwards guitar and drums that pre-date scratching by 10 years. Musicologist Ritchie Unterberger considers the lyrics to [...] "I Don't Live Today" [...] to be <b>more</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in a gothic rock setting than in psychedelia, however; he describes the music as being [...] "played and sung with an ebullience that belies the darkness of the lyrics." [...] The song's tribal rhythms served as a platform for Hendrix's innovative guitar feedback improvisations. Whereas [...] "Fire" [...] is a funk and soul hybrid driven by Mitchell's drumming, [...] "May This Be Love" [...] and [...] "The Wind Cries Mary" [...] are soft ballads that demonstrate Hendrix's ability to write thoughtful lyrics and subtle melodies. The influence of raga rock can be heard in his sitar-like guitar solo on [...] "Love or Confusion". [...] "Can You See Me" [...] is an uptempo rocker that features Hendrix's double tracked vocals and his use of a one-note bend in the style of Hank Marvin. Although [...] "Hey Joe" [...] is a folk song, and the only cover on the album, it would become one of Hendrix's most requested tracks.|$|E
