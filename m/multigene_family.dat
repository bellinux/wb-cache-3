25|$|Although {{some of the}} {{properties}} of PfEMP1 were firmly established, the protein was difficult to isolate due to its low occurrence. Five years after its discovery, {{one of the original}} researchers Irwin Sherman began to doubt the existence of PfEMP1 as a unique protein. He argued that the antigen could be merely a surface protein of RBCs that changes upon infection with malarial parasites. A consensus was achieved in 1995 following the identification (by cloning) of the gene for PfEMP1. The discovery of the genes was independently reported by Howard's team and two other teams at NIH. Howard's team identified two genes for PfEMP1, and recombinant protein products of these genes were shown to have antigenic and adhesive properties. They further affirmed that PfEMP1 is the key molecule in the ability of P. falciparum to evade the host's immune system. Joseph D. Smith and others showed that PfEMP1 is actually a large family of proteins encoded by a <b>multigene</b> <b>family</b> called var. The gene products can bind to a variety of receptors including those on endothelial cells. Xin-Zhuan Su and others showed that there could be more than 50 var genes which are distributed on different chromosomes of the malarial parasite.|$|E

40|$|Concerted {{evolution}} is often invoked {{to explain the}} diversity and evolution of the <b>multigene</b> <b>families</b> of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes and immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. However, this hypothesis has been controversial because the member genes of these families from the same species are not necessarily {{more closely related to}} one another than to the genes from different species. To resolve this controversy, we conducted phylogenetic analyses of several <b>multigene</b> <b>families</b> of the MHC and Ig systems. The results show that the evolutionary pattern of these families is quite different from that of concerted evolution but is in agreement with the birth-and-death model of evolution in which new genes are created by repeated gene duplication and some duplicate genes are maintained in the genome for a long time but others are deleted or become nonfunctional by deleterious mutations.

40|$|Many variant {{proteins}} encoded by Plasmodium-specific <b>multigene</b> <b>families</b> are exported into {{red blood}} cells (RBC). P. falciparum-specific variant proteins encoded by the var, stevor and rifin <b>multigene</b> <b>families</b> are exported {{onto the surface of}} infected {{red blood cells}} (iRBC) and mediate interactions between iRBC and host cells resulting in tissue sequestration and rosetting. However, the precise function of most other Plasmodium <b>multigene</b> <b>families</b> encoding exported proteins is unknown. To understand the role of RBC-exported proteins of rodent malaria parasites (RMP) we analysed the expression and cellular location by fluorescent-tagging of members of the pir, fam-a and fam-b <b>multigene</b> <b>families.</b> Furthermore, we performed phylogenetic analyses of the fam-a and fam-b <b>multigene</b> <b>families,</b> which indicate that both families have a history of functional differentiation unique to RMP. We demonstrate for all three families that expression of family members in iRBC is not mutually exclusive. Most tagged proteins were transported into the iRBC cytoplasm but not onto the iRBC plasma membrane, indicating that they are unlikely to play a direct role in iRBC-host cell interactions. Unexpectedly, most family members are also expressed during the liver stage, where they are transported into the parasitophorous vacuole. This suggests that these protein families promote parasite development in both the liver and blood, either by supporting parasite development within hepatocytes and erythrocytes and/or by manipulating the host immune response. Indeed, in the case of Fam-A, which have a steroidogenic acute regulatory-related lipid transfer (START) domain, we found that several family members can transfer phosphatidylcholine in vitro. These observations indicate that these proteins may transport (host) phosphatidylcholine for membrane synthesis. This is the first demonstration of a biological function of any exported variant protein family of rodent malaria parasites...|$|R

Results The location of major rDNA was coincident with the previous analysis for this species. On the other hand, the 5 S rDNA mapped in almost all chromosomes of the standard complement (except in the pair 11) and in the B chromosome, showing a distinct result from other populations previously analyzed. Besides the spreading of 5 S rDNA in the genome of R. brasiliensis it was also observed multiple sites for H 3 histone genes, being located in the same chromosomal regions of 5 S rDNAs, including the presence of the H 3 gene in the B chromosome. Conclusions Due to the intense spreading of 5 S rRNA and H 3 histone genes in the genome of R. brasiliensis, their chromosomal distribution was not informative in the clarification of the origin of B elements.
