5|$|Due to {{the extreme}} nature of the {{original}} NES Battletoads difficulty, almost all future ports went to measures to tone it down to varying degrees, seeking to make the game <b>more</b> <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> casual players. The Mega Drive version of Battletoads features toned down difficulty, {{as well as providing}} higher definition and more colourful graphics as opposed to the NES version. The Game Gear port features downscaled graphics, also removing three levels and the two-player mode.|$|E

The game also features training and fitness modes that monitor players' progress in the sports.|$|E

5|$|The post-Chalukya {{period is}} characterised by the {{popularity}} of Shaiva and Vaishnava devotional writings, though secular and courtly topics written in native metres continued to flourish. Native metres in vogue were the shatpadi (six-line verse), the tripadi, the ragle (rhymed couplets) and the sangatya (compositions meant to be sung to the accompaniment a musical instrument). Overall, Kannada writings began to change from marga ("formal", due to Sanskritic influence) to desi ("vernacular") and become <b>more</b> <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> the common man.|$|E

5|$|Berge Meere und Giganten was {{published}} in 1924 by the Fischer Verlag. In 1931 Döblin began working on a radically simplified and shortened version, {{in order to make}} the difficult work <b>more</b> <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> a wider audience; the new version {{was published}} by the Fischer Verlag in May 1932 under the title Giganten (Giants). 2006 saw the release of a new critical edition of Berge Meere und Giganten by the Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag (Munich), edited by Gabriele Sander. The original manuscript and Döblin's extensive notes for the novel are preserved in the German literary archive in Marbach am Neckar. As of 2017, there is no English translation available.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens {{have been}} {{observed}} calling wolves {{to the site of}} dead animals. The wolves open the carcass, leaving the scraps <b>more</b> <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> the birds. They watch where other common ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also been observed pretending to make a cache without actually depositing the food, presumably to confuse onlookers.|$|E
5|$|Developers {{working on}} Oblivion focused on {{providing}} a tighter storyline, with fewer filler quests and more developed characters. The developers {{sought to make}} information in the game world <b>more</b> <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> players, making the game easier {{to pick up and}} play. Oblivion features improved AI (courtesy of Bethesda's proprietary Radiant AI), improved physics (courtesy of the Havok physics engine), and impressive graphics, taking advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines like high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the creation of Oblivions terrain, leading to landscapes that are more complex and realistic than those of past titles, with less of a drain on Bethesda's staff.|$|E

5|$|From the 1970s to {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the Thayer School saw {{expansion}} into new fields such as nanotechnology and biochemical engineering, as well as collaboration with such nearby institutions as Dartmouth Medical School, the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, and the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory. In the early first decade of the 21st century, the core curriculum for undergraduates was revamped under Dean Lewis Duncan (1998–2004), making the school's offerings <b>more</b> <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> non-major Dartmouth students. The MacLean Engineering Sciences Center (ESC), completed in 2006, was a $21million project to expand the school's classrooms and research centers.|$|E
5|$|In 1899, Pope Leo XIII {{declared}} him a Doctor of the Church. He is {{the only}} native of Great Britain to achieve this designation; Anselm of Canterbury, also a Doctor of the Church, was originally from Italy. Bede was moreover a skilled linguist and translator, and his work made the Latin and Greek writings of the early Church Fathers much <b>more</b> <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> his fellow Anglo-Saxons, which contributed significantly to English Christianity. Bede's monastery had access to an impressive library which included works by Eusebius, Orosius, and many others.|$|E
5|$|In a {{departure}} from previous titles in the Myst series, End of Ages replaces pre-rendered environments with worlds rendered in real-time 3D graphics, allowing players to freely navigate the Ages. The faces of actors were digitally mapped onto three-dimensional character models to preserve realism. Cyan paid attention to making the game <b>more</b> <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> new players {{by the addition of}} multiple methods of navigation and an in-game camera. Myst creator Rand Miller decided to give players the ability to decide the fates of the game's characters as a gift to Myst fans.|$|E

At the same time, Psygnosis sought to make the game <b>more</b> <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> new players of the fast-paced racer, and kept early courses easier for these players; the difficulty was adjusted for later courses so that experts still experienced a challenge. Wipeout 3 was the first Wipeout game {{to take advantage of}} PlayStation controllers with analogue sticks, used to offer smoother control of the player's craft.|$|E
5|$|Jennings {{continued}} to promote internal infrastructure improvements throughout his term in Congress. He introduced legislation {{to build more}} forts in the northwest, to grant federal funding for improvement projects in Indiana and Ohio, and led the debate in support of using federal funds to build the nations longest canal, Wabash and Erie Canal, through Indiana. He introduced a legislative amendment that made a provision to locate and survey the National Road to the west, toward the Mississippi River, so {{the people living in}} Indiana and Illinois would have some assurance that the road's large federal appropriation would benefit them directly. Jennings helped secure appropriation of funds to survey the Wabash River and make it <b>more</b> <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> year-round steamboat travel.|$|E

London has the largest wheelchair accessible network in the world and, from the 3rd quarter of 2007, became <b>more</b> <b>accessible</b> <b>to</b> hearing and visually impaired passengers as audio-visual announcements were introduced.
