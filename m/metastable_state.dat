5|$|Bohrium has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Twelve different isotopes of bohrium have been reported with atomic masses 260–262, 264–267, 270–272, 274, and 278, one of which, bohrium-262, has a known <b>metastable</b> <b>state.</b> All of these but the unconfirmed 278Bh decay only through alpha decay, although some unknown bohrium isotopes are predicted to undergo spontaneous fission.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{tantalum}} {{consists of}} two isotopes: 180mTa (0.012%) and 181Ta (99.988%). 181Ta is a stable isotope. 180mTa (m denotes a <b>metastable</b> <b>state)</b> is predicted to decay in three ways: isomeric transition to the ground state of 180Ta, beta decay to 180W, or electron capture to 180Hf. However, radioactivity of this nuclear isomer has never been observed, and only a lower limit on its half-life of 2.0×1016years has been set. The ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of only 8 hours. 180mTa is the only naturally occurring nuclear isomer (excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short-living nuclides). It is also the rarest isotope in the Universe, {{taking into account the}} elemental abundance of tantalum and isotopic abundance of 180mTa in the natural mixture of isotopes (and again excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short-living nuclides).|$|E
5|$|The RIKEN team {{produced}} a further atom on 2 April 2005, although the decay data were slightly {{different from the}} first chain, perhaps due to either {{the formation of a}} <b>metastable</b> <b>state</b> or an alpha particle escaping from the detector before depositing its full energy. In 2004, the RIKEN team also studied the 205Tl(70Zn,n)274Rg reaction, retaining the zinc beam and impinging it on a thallium rather than a bismuth target, in an effort to directly produce 274Rg in a cross-bombardment as the immediate daughter of 278Nh. However, the thallium target was weak compared to the more commonly used lead and bismuth targets, and it deteriorated significantly and became non-uniform in thickness; hence no atoms of 274Rg were observed. This reaction was repeated in 2010 with upgraded equipment, but again without success. The reasons for this weakness are still unknown, given that thallium has a higher melting point than bismuth.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{calculate}} {{the mean number}} of <b>metastable</b> <b>states</b> for spin glasses on so called random thin graphs with couplings taken from a symmetric binary distribution ± J. Thin graphs are graphs where the local connectivity of each site is fixed to some value c. As in totally connected mean field models we find that the number of <b>metastable</b> <b>states</b> increases exponentially with the system size. Furthermore we find that the average number of <b>metastable</b> <b>states</b> decreases as c in agreement with previous studies showing that finite connectivity corrections of order 1 /c increase the number of <b>metastable</b> <b>states</b> with respect to the totally connected mean field limit. We also prove that the average number of <b>metastable</b> <b>states</b> in the limit c→∞ is finite and converges to the average number of <b>metastable</b> <b>states</b> in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. An annealed calculation for the number of <b>metastable</b> <b>states</b> N_MS(E) of energy E is also carried out giving a lower bound on the ground state energy of these spin glasses.

Under any given conditions one phase will be thermodynamically more stable than the other; therefore, this phase will form when thermodynamic equilibrium is established. However, kinetic factors may favor the formation the unfavorable precipitate (e.g. aragonite), which is then said to be in a <b>metastable</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E

25|$|In physics, the {{standard}} {{definition of a}} glass (or vitreous solid) is a solid formed by rapid melt quenching, although the term glass {{is often used to}} describe any amorphous solid that exhibits a glass transition temperature Tg. For melt quenching, if the cooling is sufficiently rapid (relative to the characteristic crystallization time) then crystallization is prevented and instead the disordered atomic configuration of the supercooled liquid is frozen into the solid state at Tg. The tendency for a material to form a glass while quenched is called glass-forming ability. This ability can be predicted by the rigidity theory. Generally, a glass exists in a structurally <b>metastable</b> <b>state</b> with respect to its crystalline form, although in certain circumstances, for example in atactic polymers, there is no crystalline analogue of the amorphous phase.|$|E
