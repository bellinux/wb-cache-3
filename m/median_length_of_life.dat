40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis compares {{characteristics of}} length {{of life in}} the Czech Republic, Norway and Spain in the period 1960 - 2014. The aim is to analyse the mortality process using life expectancy and <b>median</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> at selected ages 0, 65 and 80 years and modal age at death. Decreasing infant mortality and better death rates for older persons positively still affect growth of lengths of life after completion of demographic transition. However, it leads to ageing population when people are dying at older age and number of these people is growing. This has the effect of assimilation of examined characteristics. Long-term different development of mortality through age structure has divided Europe into regions, consequently has occurred higher within-country gender difference. Women live longer than men. The new trend is reduction of gender difference at almost every age. It also researches these changes and differentials to prove or disprove convergence between men and women and selected characteristics of length of life...|$|E
40|$|We give simple {{upper and}} lower bounds on life {{expectancy}}. In a life-table population, if e(0) is the life expectancy at birth, M is the <b>median</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> and e(M) is the expected remaining life at age M, then (M+e(M)) / 2 &# 8804;e(0) &# 8804;M+e(M) / 2. In general, for any age x, if e(x) is the expected remaining life at age x, and &# 8467;(x) is the fraction of a cohort surviving to age x at least, then (x+e(x)) &# 8804;l(x) &# 8804;e(0) &# 8804;x+l(x) &# 8729;e(x).

These inequalities give bounds on e(0) without detailed knowledge of the course of mortality prior to age x, provided &# 8467;(x) can be estimated.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundIn 1992 France {{set up a}} {{national}} cystic fibrosis observatory (Observatoire national de la mucoviscidose, ONM) to monitor the state of health of patients on an annual basis. Using the ONM data, this study estimates the main indicators for life expectancy and assesses {{the total number of}} cystic fibrosis patients. MethodsThe data for the years 1994 to 2003 are divided into 3 -year periods. Life tables are drawn up for these periods, from which mean and median lengths of life are determined. Using the most recent life table, the number of births in 2003 and the incidence of the disease, the total population of patients can be estimated, assuming a stationary population. ResultsIn 2001 – 2003, life expectancy at birth of patients registered with the ONM was 39. 1  years and <b>median</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> was 36. 4  years. These results, substantially better than those of 1994 – 1996, are linked to improved conditions of patient inclusion in the ONM database, to improvements in their healthcare, but also to the limitations of the life tables. Based on the 2003 data, the total theoretical number of patients is 6490, and coverage by the ONM database is thus 63. 2 %. ConclusionsThese provisional results demonstrate the need to convert the ONM observatory into a registry providing exhaustive coverage of all patients...|$|E
40|$|Long-term dietary {{restriction}} {{programs which}} retard aging processes in rodents usually involve meal eating {{rather than the}} nibbling pattern of food intake of ad libitum fed rodents. Thus, the possibility arises that the antiaging action may {{at least in part}} result from an altered temporal pattern of food intake. This possibility was investigated using male F 344 rats maintained on the following dietary regimens: Group A rats fed ad libitum; Group B rats fed 60 % the ad libitum intake in a single meal at 1500 h; Group B- 2 rats fed 60 % of the ad libitum intake in two meals (0700 h and 1500 h). The diurnal pattern of plasma corticosterone concentration differed among the groups as did that of the plasma glucose concentration. The <b>median</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and age of tenth percentile survivors were similar for Group B and B- 2 rats and much greater than those for Group A rats. Both modes of dietary restriction influenced age-associated disease processes in a similar fashion. Thus, although the temporal pattern of food intake influenced circadian rhythms of food-restricted rats, it did not significantly affect the antiaging action. RESTRICTING food intake of mice and rats (referred toas dietary restriction, or DR) below that of ad libitum fed animals increases life span and retards aging processes (Weindruch and Walford, 1988). Current evidence points to a reduction in energy intake as the major factor underlying this antiaging action (Masoro, 1988). However, DR in...|$|E
40|$|Background : Recent {{evidence}} from health and demographic surveillance sites (HDSS) {{has shown that}} increasing access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is reducing mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, due to limited vital statistics registration {{in many of the}} countries most affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, there is limited evidence of the magnitude of ART's effect outside of specific HDSS sites. This paper leverages longitudinal household/family roster data from the Malawi Longitudinal Survey of Families and Health (MLSFH) to estimate the effect of ART availability in public clinics on population-level mortality based on a geographically dispersed sample of individuals in rural Malawi. Objective : We seek to provide evidence on the population-level magnitude of the ART-associated mortality decline in rural Malawi and confirm that this population is experiencing similar declines in mortality as those seen in HDSS sites. Methods : We analyze longitudinal household/family-roster data from four waves of the MLSFH to estimate mortality change after the introduction of ART to study areas. We analyze life expectancy using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and examine how the mortality hazard changed over time by individual characteristics with Cox regression. Results : In the four years following rollout of ART, life expectancy at age 15 increased by 3. 1 years (95 Š CI 1. 1, 5. 1), and <b>median</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> rose by over ten years. Contribution : Our observations show that the increased availability of ART resulted in a substantial and sustained reversal of mortality trends in SSA and assuage concerns that the post-ART reversals in mortality are not occurring at the same magnitude outside of specific HDSSs...|$|E

In this paper, we estimate and compare within-group and between-group inequalities in <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> for population groups in Ethiopia in 2000 and 2011. Methods: We used data from the 2011 and 2000 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey and the Global Burden of Disease study 2010, and the MODMATCH modified logit life table system developed by the World Health Organization to model mortality rates, <b>life</b> expectancy, and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> for Ethiopian population groups stratified by wealth quintiles, gender and residence.

Results: <b>Length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> inequality has decreased and life expectancy has increased for all population groups between 2000 and 2011. <b>Length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> inequality within wealth quintiles is about three {{times larger than the}} between-group inequality of 9 years.
