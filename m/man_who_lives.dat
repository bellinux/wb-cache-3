5|$|In the Main Story, Nero {{is a young}} <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>lives</b> in the castle-town of Fortuna on {{a mysterious}} island, {{isolated}} {{from the rest of}} the world. Fortuna is home to The Order of the Sword, a sect of holy knights who worship the demon Sparda as their God. Their leader, is the High Priest Sanctus, who leads the congregation as a benevolent spiritual leader, despite Nero's clear lack of faith. With the white hair and attitude not unlike a descendant of Sparda, his true parentage remains a mystery. Discovered on the island as a baby, Nero was sent to live with Credo, The Captain of the Holy Knights, who raised Nero to fight demons alongside his peaceful younger sister Kyrie, whom Nero eventually develops feelings for. Though Nero does not believe in The Order’s worship of Sparda, and openly subverts convention by using firearms, and customizing his own sword with a motorcycle handle that shoots flames, he truly believes in protecting the innocent.|$|E

The episode also contained the first mention of Newman, as a suicidal <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>lives</b> in Jerry and Kramer's apartment building, who would later become a popular recurring character.

500|$|The Hesses set {{the series}} {{towards the end}} of the Napoleon Dynamite film; Scully said they {{transferred}} the characters and premise, but not the events of the film. In the film, set in the small town of Preston, Idaho, Napoleon (Jon Heder) is an awkward 16-year-old boy who loves practicing ninja moves, dancing and drawing pictures of a liger, an animal he says is bred for its skills in magic. He also makes up stories about himself about hunting wolverines in Alaska and a gang wanting him to join because of his skill with a bo staff. His brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) is an unemployed 32-year-old; flimsy and gawky, he is the target of Napoleon's outlashes, although he often brags of his wrestling abilities and overall coolness; he spends his days in an internet chat room talking to a woman named Lafawnduh. The two live with their grandmother, Carlinda (Sandy Martin), who enjoys riding all-terrain vehicles. Deborah [...] "Deb" [...] Bradshaw (Tina Majorino) is a shy, quiet, sweet, and artistically inclined girl who is infatuated with Napoleon upon first meeting him. Napoleon's uncle Rico (Jon Gries) is a middle-aged <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>lives</b> in a camper van and is obsessed with his failed football career and with attempts at get rich quick schemes.

500|$|The season {{introduced}} several {{characters who}} returned {{later on the}} show. The episode [...] "The Pony Remark" [...] featured the second appearance of Helen and Morty Seinfeld, both of whom had previously appeared in the season 1 episode [...] "The Stake Out". In [...] "The Stakeout", Morty was portrayed by Phil Bruns; however, David and Seinfeld wanted the character to be harsher, and re-cast him with Barney Martin, who auditioned for the part on October 15, 1990 at 12:45pm. Martin was unaware that another actor had already established the part. Helen was portrayed by Liz Sheridan, who had played her in [...] "The Stake Out" [...] The same episode introduced Jerry's uncle Leo, portrayed by Len Lesser, who {{was known for his}} acting in gangster films such as The Outlaw Josey Wales and Kelly's Heroes. When Lesser auditioned for the part on October 22, 1990, he incited laughs from David, Seinfeld, and casting director Marc Hirschfeld, but did not understand why, because he did not think his lines were funny. Herschfield stated that when Lesser had auditioned {{it was clear that he}} was the right actor for the part. [...] "The Revenge" [...] features the first appearance by Newman (voiced by David), a suicidal <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>lives</b> in Jerry's apartment building. In [...] "The Revenge", Newman remained out of sight, although he appeared in a deleted scene. Before this scene was cut, William Thomas, Jr. had been cast for the part. Although the writing staff never intended for Newman to return to the show, the idea of having Wayne Knight as a neighbor appealed to them. Therefore, Knight was re-cast in the role of Newman for the season 3 episode [...] "The Suicide".|$|E
500|$|The {{show has}} {{received}} critical acclaim, sustaining positive reviews across its first three series. Series one holds a Metacritic score of 85/100, based on 17 reviews, and series two scored 91/100, based on 24 reviews, while series three holds {{a score of}} 88/100, based on 22 reviews. The first series holds a 100% rating at critical aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, the second holds a 93% rating, and the third series has a 96% approval rating. The fourth series holds a rating of 61%. The first episode rated highly on the Appreciation Index. The Observer said the show was [...] "a cross between Withnail and I and The Bourne Ultimatum, {{there is also a}} hint of Doctor Who about the drama; hardly surprising, since it has been written and created by Doctor Who writers Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat." [...] The Guardians Dan Martin said, [...] "It's early days, but the first of three 90-minute movies, 'A Study in Pink', is brilliantly promising. It has the finesse of Spooks but is indisputably Sherlock Holmes. The deduction sequences are ingenious, and the plot is classic Moffat intricacy." [...] Tom Sutcliffe for The Independent wrote, [...] "Sherlock is a triumph, witty and knowing, without ever undercutting the flair and dazzle of the original. It understands that Holmes isn't really about plot but about charisma ... Flagrantly unfaithful to the original in some respects, Sherlock is wonderfully loyal to it in every way that matters." [...] The lead actors were commended. Critic Victoria Thorpe said, [...] "Freeman's dependable, capable Watson unlocks this modern Holmes, a man who now describes himself as 'a high-functioning '." [...] Following the second series' opening episode, Sarah Crompton, for The Telegraph, asserts that [...] "Cumberbatch is utterly credible as a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>lives</b> entirely in his cerebellum with little regard for the world outside, mak Sherlock the perfect depiction of Holmes for our times".|$|E
