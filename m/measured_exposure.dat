40|$|The use of {{exposure}} modelling tools for estimating chemical airborne exposure has increased since the European Union's REACH legislation for safe use of industrial chemicals came into force. Two tools that European Chemicals Agency recommends are Stoffenmanager® and the Advanced REACH Tool (ART). The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the validity of these two exposure modelling tools by comparing the lack of agreement between estimated and <b>measured</b> <b>exposure.</b> We examined the airborne chemical exposure at companies in seven different types of industries: wood, printing, foundry, spray painting, flour milling, chemical industry, and plastic moulding industry. The inhalable exposure of liquids or powders at two to three situations at each company was modelled with both tools and measured. To study the validity of the tools, the mean differences and precisions (lack of agreement) {{of exposure}}s from both situations handling liquids and powders were calculated by using the 50 th percentile outcome of the tools and the geometric mean of the <b>measured</b> <b>exposure</b> (all data were ln transformed). For Stoffenmanager, the mean difference and precision of the situations concerning liquids were 0. 22 ± 1. 0 and for powders - 0. 024 ± 0. 66.

If pair members are not independent, {{this is not necessarily}} true. It has been shown previously that the usual matched-pair estimate remains consistent if the exposure of interest is correlated within the pairs.

We examine the effect of wfthin-pair correlation of unmeasured risk factors independent of the <b>measured</b> <b>exposure.</b> This is done {{within the context of a}} simple matched-pair case-control study. We compare the large-sample expectation of the usual matched-pair estimate to the population odds ratio. Results. We show that the usual estimate may be inconsistent in the presence of this correlation. However, if the disease is rare, the magnitude of the bias will be negligible. Conclusions.

40|$|In {{the scope}} of a Dutch {{programme}} to reinforce the working conditions policy on hazardous substances, an internet-based tool was developed to help small- and medium-sized companies to handle hazardous substances with more care. The heart of this tool, called the Stoffenmanager, is a risk banding scheme. It combines a hazard banding scheme {{similar to that of}} COSHH Essentials and an exposure banding scheme based on an existing exposure model that has been modified to allow non-expert users to understand and use the model. Exposure scores are calculated based on categorization of determinants of emission, transmission and immission. These exposure scores are assigned to exposure bands. The comparison of exposure bands and hazard bands leads to a risk band or priority band. Following the evaluation of the priority of tasks done with products, generic exposure control measures can be evaluated for their possibility to lower the risks. Relevant control measures can be put into an action plan and into workplace instruction cards. The tool has several other functionalities regarding registration and storage of products. The exposure model in the Stoffenmanager leads to exposure scores. These have been compared with <b>measured</b> <b>exposure</b> levels.

The authors investigated this potential association using personal dosimeters. Methods A 24 -hour exposure profile of 1484 children and 1508 adolescents was generated in a population-based cross-sectional study in Germany between 2006 and 2008 (participation 52 %). Personal interview data on socio-demographic characteristics, self-reported exposure and potential confounders were collected. Acute symptoms were assessed twice during the study day using a symptom diary. Results Only few of {{the large number of}} investigated associations were found to be statistically significant. At noon, adolescents with a <b>measured</b> <b>exposure</b> in the highest quartile during morning hours reported a statistically significant higher intensity of headache (Odd Ratio: 1. 50; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 03, 2. 19). At bedtime, adolescents with a <b>measured</b> <b>exposure</b> in the highest quartile during afternoon hours reported a statistically significant higher intensity of irritation in the evening (4 th quartile 1. 79; 1. 23, 2. 61), while children reported a statistically significant higher intensity of concentration problems (4 th quartile 1. 55; 1. 02, 2. 33). Conclusions We observed few statistically significant results which are not consistent over the two time points. Furthermore, when the 10 % of the participants with the highest exposure are taken into consideration the significant results of the main analysis could not be confirmed. Based on the pattern of these results, we assume that the few observed significant associations are not causal but rather occurred by chance. </p...|$|E

Methods: This study examines the validity of self-reports of exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) compared to objectively <b>measured</b> <b>exposure</b> among children and adults in outdoor recreation settings in 4 regions of the United States. Objective UVR exposures of 515 participants were measured using polysulfone film badge UVR dosimeters on 2 days. The same subjects provided self-reported UVR exposure data on surveys and 4 -day sun exposure diaries, for comparison to their objectively <b>measured</b> <b>exposure.</b> Results:Dosimeter data showed that lifeguards had the greatest UVR exposure (24. 5 % of weekday ambient UVR), children the next highest exposures (10. 3 % ambient weekday UVR), and parents had the lowest (6. 6 % ambient weekday UVR). Similar patterns were observed in self-report data. Correlations between diary reports and dosimeter findings were fair to good and were highest for lifeguards (r 0. 38 – 0. 57), followed by parents (r 0. 28 – 0. 29) and children (r 0. 18 – 0. 34). Correlations between survey and diary measures were moderate to good for lifeguards (r 0. 20 – 0. 54) and children (r 0. 35 – 0. 53). Conclusions: This is the largest study of its kind to date, and supports the utility of self-report measures of solar UVR exposure.
