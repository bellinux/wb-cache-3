40|$|Universal in most {{climate change}} {{scenarios}} for the 21 st century is {{the increase of}} the global mean temperature. By {{the end of the}} century the increase may be 1 - 6 oC depending on the chosen emission scenario. Climate scenarios for Sweden point to a warmer and more humid climate in future. It can be expected that the building parts, which are already susceptible for <b>moisture</b> <b>load,</b> will degrade more in future. In Sweden, a ventilated cold attic is a typical representative of a moisture-sensitive construction part. This paper investigates numerically the hygro-thermal response of a typical ventilated attic to a possible future climate load in Sweden. The hygro-thermal conditions in the attic are assessed by a mould growth index (MGI). The results showed the increment of MGI in future for all test cases. The analysis showed that the orientation of a roof and the <b>moisture</b> <b>load</b> to the attic from a dwelling underneath are the influencing parameters on MGI. Since the latter is governed mainly by the ventilation system in a house, the type of the ventilation system is important design parameter for the prevention of future moisture problems in ventilated attics...|$|E

Hemp and Stone Wool insulations were installed in timber frame wall panels without vapour barrier. The comparison was made in terms of heat transfer properties, likelihood of mould growth and condensation. Step changes in internal relative humidity were performed to explore the effect of high and normal internal <b>moisture</b> <b>load</b> on the wall panels. No {{significant difference between the}} average equivalent thermal transmittance (U-values) of the panels incorporating Hemp and Stone Wool insulations was observed. The average equivalent U-values of the panels were closer to the calculated U-values of the panels based on the manufacturers’ declared thermal conductivity of Hemp and Stone Wool insulations. It was observed that the placement of heat flux sensor along the depth of the insulation had significant influence on the measured equivalent U-value of the panels during high internal <b>moisture</b> <b>load.</b> The frequency and likelihood of condensation was higher in the interface of Stone Wool and Oriented Strand Board (OSB). In terms of the parametric assessment of mould germination potential, relative humidity, temperature and exposure conditions in the insulation-OSB interfaces were found to be favourable to germination of mould spore. However, when the insulations were dismantled, no mould was visually detected...|$|E

40|$|The {{infiltration}} of rainwater {{can result from}} envelope defects that allow water to infiltrate into the stud cavity behind the exterior sheathing, i. e. the back wall. Once rainwater migrates into the stud space, it cannot easily evacuate and is thus likely to accumulate, leading to potential degradation of the wood studs and exterior sheathing, depending on the temperature conditions. Therefore, studying the drying potential of wood-frame wall assemblies that {{have been subjected to}} a <b>moisture</b> <b>load</b> like rain infiltration can provide valuable information with respect to the assembly's hygrothermal performance. The primary objectives of the research project were: (1) To evaluate the wetting and drying performance of hygroscopic components in wood-frame wall assemblies wetted by rain infiltration; (2) To investigate the impact of several parameters on the hygrothermal response of the various monitored components such as the sheathing material, the type of vapor retarder, and the presence of foam insulation on the exterior side of the assembly, (3) To develop a framework for large-scale envelope testing of wall assemblies subjected to wind-driven rain infiltration. The role of the vapor retarder, the exterior insulation, an added exterior insulation, the wall height, the presence of hygroscopic cladding was studied and the effect of varying the <b>moisture</b> <b>load</b> was also investigated. The research was primarily experimental but also included some simulation work. The moisture content results from the experiments show that the sheathing material had the most significant impact on the drying response of the wall components, with the lowest and highest drying rate occurring when OSB and fiberboard sheathings were employed, respectively. Increasing the vapor permeability of the vapor retarder within the range allowed by the National Building Code of Canada increased the drying rate of the wetted components within the walls when OSB sheathing was employed. Comparison of the experimental and numerical results highlighted the difficulties in simulating a three-dimensional problem in a two-dimensional domain, the need for accurate and complete material properties, and the need to include of all relevant transport phenomena like air transport in hygrothermal envelope models to increase the accuracy of the simulation result...|$|E

The heating load for conservation heating when applied in a Nordic climate was characterized in order to investigate if and how air-to-air heat pumps can be used for conservation heating. Heating for conservation results in indoor temperatures that follow the seasonal variation of the outdoor temperature. Depending on the season and <b>moisture</b> <b>load</b> on the building, the indoor temperature will be 0 - 10 °C higher than the ambient temperature. The heating load is much smaller and more stable over the year as compared to heating for comfort. In the south of Sweden conservation heating is motivated mainly by preservation aspects, whereas in northern Sweden the potential for energy saving is considerable. Heat pumps in general and air-to air heat pumps in particular, have properties that match the requirements of conservation heating and can provide a cost effective solution.

40|$|As amethod to {{mitigate}} greenhouse gas emissions, electric vehicles (EVs) {{are regarded as}} an alternative to conventional cars. TheHVAC system is the most energy-consuming auxiliary systems in EVs. The HVAC system is made up of three functions, heating, cooling, and dehumidification, providing a comfortable driving environment. To be more specific, the AC system aims for cooling and dehumidifying the airflow to the passenger compartment. The heating system takes care of the heating demand in car by circulating hot coolant. In winter time, the cold outside air is heated up to high supply temperature, which consumes large amounts of energy and accelerates batteries depleting. Cabin air can be recirculated to increase the driving range, but the high moisture in it is the main issue. Therefore, alternative dehumidification methods having good performance at lower ambient temperatures are required. Meanwhile, energy consumption in AC system should also be as small as possible to extend driving range. For fully recirculating cabin air, an alternative dehumidification should have a capability of removing the moisture from human respiration and other internal moisture loads. In literature review, several methods of dehumidification have been introduced based on their mechanisms and characteristics. Due to the high requirements of compact and compatibility of automotive HVAC system, the scope of study narrows down to two technologies, AC system with head pressure regulating valve and desiccant wheel system. The AC system can usually be operated above 0 ±C. With a head pressure regulating valve implemented, the modified AC system can also work in winter time as a dehumidifier. When the ambient temperature goes down to - 20 ±C, the new system can reduce heating power by 34. 5 %. The additional cooling power depends on the different level of <b>moisture</b> <b>load.</b> High <b>moisture</b> <b>load</b> can increase the energy consumption in the AC system. Recirculated air can mix with cold outside air with variable recirculation ratio, to cut down energy consumption further. A desiccant wheel gives better performance in term of reducing energy consumption than mechanical dehumidification. The heating power is reduced by 50 % after implementing a desiccant wheel, when the ambient temperature is - 20 ±C. Instead ofmechanical dehumidification gaining benefit only under an extreme cold weather, a desiccant wheel reduces power consumption in HVAC system on a wider scale...|$|E

This was used to inform the design and synthesis of two new mesoporous silica (MS) materials suitable for specific applications. To validate the technique, the new materials were experimentally assessed using gravimetric dynamic vapour sorption (DVS). The experimental isotherms closely matched the optimised isotherm predictions from the design stage, and a positive correlation was observed between the rate of change in adsorbed water content, Δw and the time taken to exceed the permissible upper limit of humidity, φi,U in a closed environment. A positive non-linear correlation was determined between the interior volumetric <b>moisture</b> <b>load,</b> ωml and the mass of adsorbent required to fully achieve humidity buffering between specified lower/ upper limits (φi,L and φi,U). The kinetics of water vapour sorption/ desorption were found to have general agreement when using the current hygrothermal numerical model. Current hygrothermal models appear to significantly underestimate the rate of adsorption/ desorption in rapid-response mesoporous silica type materials. This is perhaps largely due to the current lack of consideration for scanning curve prediction within hysteresis loops and so is a priority for future research...|$|E

Hygrothermal simulations {{were prepared for}} several common approaches to High R-value wall construction in six cities (Houston, Atlanta, Seattle, St. Louis, Chicago, and International Falls) representing a range of climate zones (2, 3, 4 C, 4, 5 A, and 7, respectively). The simulations are informed by experience gained from past {{research in this area}} and validated by field measurement and forensic experience. The modeling program was developed to assess the moisture durability of the wall assemblies based on three primary sources of moisture: construction moisture, air leakage condensation, and bulk water leakage. The peak annual moisture content of the wood based exterior sheathing was used to comparatively analyze the response to the <b>moisture</b> <b>loads</b> for each of the walls in each given city. Walls which experienced sheathing moisture contents between 20 % and 28 % were identified as risky, whereas those exceeding 28 % were identified as very high risk. All of the wall assemblies perform well under idealized conditions. However, only the walls with exterior insulation, or cavity insulation which provides a hygrothermal function similar to exterior insulation, perform adequately when exposed to <b>moisture</b> <b>loads.</b> Walls with only cavity insulation are particularly susceptible to air leakage condensation. None of the walls performed well when a precipitation based bulk water leak was introduced to the backside of the sheathing, emphasizing the importance of proper flashing details...|$|R

Because of the different characteristics of pastes, it is impossible to recommend a universal type of dryer for all of these materials. Some of the dryers available provide only indirect contact with the drying agent (heat) and also maintain constant moisture with a system of rotating paddles. We evaluated the performance of this type by studying the dryer kinetics curves for ground coffee under a variety of operational conditions of <b>moisture</b> <b>load</b> of material, temperature of the heating plate, intensity of the mechanical mixing of the moisture material, and initial moisture. The effects of these parameters (except for moisture) were studied using a 2 3 factorial design. According the analyses of the kinetics drying curves, was observed that the increase in the temperature of the plate and rotation as well as the decrease in the load facilitates more effective removal of moisture. In statistical analysis was determined that the load of the material and the heating plate temperature influence the final moisture content of the material and plate temperature modifies the final temperature of the solid.

It is concluded that the modeling approach may be useful for estimating the magnitude of the human induced heat and moisture source loads. The case study is not usable for estimating the buffering capacity of the interior objects due to the weak dependency on the quantity of moisture storage material (there is almost no hygroscopic material present). However, the present approach has the side effect that it may be usable to indicate the effect of wet clothing. This study shows that the moisture source load of wet clothing per person can be of the same order as the moisture produced per person.

A study is presented here on the correlation between wind driven rain (WDR) as the moisture source and the relative proportions of water penetration at intended defects (openings) at the interface of windows and walls. In this field investigation, eight full-scale exterior wall panels with vinyl sidings and concealed barrier stucco claddings were built and installed on a field testing station, subjected to real BC climate. From November 1, 2013 – June 19, 2014, rainwater was collected and measured instantaneously from vulnerable detail locations, such as at window sill and at missing sealant defect locations, and then synchronized to the weather data to estimate the potential rain load that may contribute to a leakage into the wood framing assembly. Leakage amounts of approximately 0. 5 % and 1. 5 % of WDR were estimated from the sill corner locations of vinyl sidings and stucco-clad test walls, respectively. Although high solar exposures on these South East facing walls facilitated the drying process, the sheathing membranes on the stucco-clad walls were found to experience high amounts of moisture loads.
