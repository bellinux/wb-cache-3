40|$|Introduction: The need of {{desks and}} chairs at school which {{appropriate}} with student 2 ̆ 7 s anthropometry are very important. Desks and chairs which not suit with student 2 ̆ 7 s anthropometry {{will lead to}} fatigue. At Kabupaten Gresik, the provision of desks and chairs which suit with student 2 ̆ 7 s anthropometry still less in number. This study was aimed to provide recomendation for an ergonomic desk and chair prototype to improve seating position on senior high school students at Kabupaten Gresik. Method: This was preexperiment research with one group pre post test design. Research subjects were students at SMAN 1 Menganti and SMAN 1 Cerme, Kabupaten Gresik, 139 students were involved. Result: The recomendation of ergonomic desks and chairs specifi cation according to student 2 ̆ 7 s anthropometry were: 1) Prototypechair N, length = 48 cm, wide = 43 cm, cushion base 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>height</b> from floor surfaces = 47 cm, bag keeper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>height</b> from floor surfaces = 3 cm, bag keeper 2 ̆ 7 s wide= 43 cm, bag keeper 2 ̆ 7 s length = 47 cm, cushion 2 ̆ 7 s wide = 41 cm, cushion 2 ̆ 7 s length = 46 cm, handrest 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>height</b> = 22 cm, handrest 2 ̆ 7 s length = 30 cm, backrest 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>height</b> = 38 cm, backrest 2 ̆ 7 s wide = 43 cm, cushion 2 ̆ 7 s foam thickness = 4 cm, backrest 2 ̆ 7 s foam thickness = 4 cm; 2) Prototype desk N, length = 50 cm, wide = 66 cm, back section 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>height</b> = 85 cm, front section 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>height</b> = 75 cm, footrest from fl oor surfaces = 10 cm, drawer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>height</b> = 10 cm, front bamper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>height</b> = 40 cm, and table 2 ̆ 7 s angle = 10 o. Discussion: An ergonomic desks and chairs are very important for students at school, it will help teaching learning process run well and comfortable. The measurement of desk and chair must be reviewed after fi ve years, because of student 2 ̆ 7 s anthropometric development. So then students will feel no fatigue...|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigated}} South African <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement {{and the possible}} influences of {{various factors such as}} demographic characteristics, expenditure on clothing, the frequency of clothing purchases, store patronage and <b>men</b> <b>s</b> work dress code. A survey was conducted across Gauteng which is the largest retail hub in South Africa with mainly urban areas. Most consumers in Gauteng have access to different clothing retailers. Consulta Research, a professional research company assisted with data collection. Data was collected by means of convenient sampling. Online questionnaires were distributed to their data base and a total of 479 usable questionnaires were completed. Data analysis consisted of descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, ANOVA s, Chi square tests and other post hoc tests. The study confirmed that men clothing involvement is not equally strong for all four dimensions of clothing involvement that are distinguished in literature. Previous studies suggested that involvement should be studied from an age ordering perspective, and therefore respondents demographic characteristics were vital in terms of the analysis of the data. Certain demographic characteristics seemed to be good indicators of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement, namely age and marital status while factors such as work dress code surprisingly {{do not seem to be}} useful to predict <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement. The majority of the sample spent less than 5 % of their monthly household income on clothing for themselves and indicated that they purchase clothing sporadically when necessary. Findings nevertheless indicated that expenditure on their clothing and frequency of clothing purchases are useful indicators of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement. Although younger men (generation Y) were more inclined to patronise specialised <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing retailers, irrespective of their work dress code, the majority of men patronised general retailers and department stores when purchasing their clothing. Findings confirm that consumption- and purchase involvement are the prevalent forms of clothing involvement that are relevant in terms of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing behaviour. Indications are that <b>men</b> <b>s</b> advertising involvement is not particularly strong, which implies that they gain their product information and fashion information from alternative sources that rather relates to purchase involvement which tested high in most cases. This has implications for retail because <b>men</b> <b>s</b> stronger purchase involvement probably means that the physical retail environment is more important in terms of fashion information and to inspire <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing purchases. Therefore retailers should focus more on factors that make in-store decisions easier for males such as displays and placement of clothing. Male apparel is a potentially lucrative and growing market that can be even more profitable. Younger men spend more on their clothing therefore this group should therefore take preference but the older men should not be forgotten. Based on the findings of this study various recommendations are made with a large focus to either expand this study or build onto this existing research. Topics related to male clothing and involvement of clothing can definitely be built on and studied more in the apparel industry to fill a gap on knowledge that is lacking and should be explored further.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} Indian {{middle class}} <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear {{of violence in}} public spaces. It attempts to broaden {{the perspective of the}} implications of fear of violence. Both the public and academic discourses on violence in public spaces in India are centered on the notion of the female victim. In this thesis I argue that we need to open up a strict binary understanding of only women as vulnerable and affected by the fear of crime in public spaces. I discuss the gendered implications of different types of violence, and how different identity categories that cut across gender, have an impact on middle class <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear. In addition to this I assess how the fear for others safety and the masculine ideal of being a protector has an impact on <b>men</b> <b>s</b> personal fear of violence. Because there is no research on <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear of crime in an Indian context I have supported my analyses with three theoretical frameworks, all relevant in different ways. This is the research on masculinity in India, the research on men and fear from the West, and the research on middle class women and fear of crime in India. My own research consists of data collected through a survey where 98 men and women participated, and interviews with men who are involved in initiatives for safer cities. To understand how fear of violence in public spaces is affecting lives in India, it is necessary to not restrict ourselves to only women s narratives. This thesis is an attempt at putting <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear of violence on the agenda, and hopefully it contributes to a widening of the understanding of fear of violence in public spaces...|$|R

The first stage was to delimit forest stands using eCognition and a digital canopy height model (DCHM) derived from lidar data. The polygons were then clustered (k-means algorithm) into forest structure types based on the DCHMdata within forest stands. Hypsographs of each polygon and field data validated the separability of structure types. In the study area, 112 polygons of Pinus sylvestris were segmented and classified into five forest structure types, ranging from high dense forest canopy (850 trees ha_ 1 and Lorey´ <b>s</b> <b>height</b> of 17. 4 m) to scarce tree coverage (60 tree ha_ 1 and Lorey´ <b>s</b> <b>height</b> of 9. 7 m). Our {{results indicate that the}} best variables for the definition and characterization of forest structure in these forests are the median and standard deviation (S.

In semi-precast concrete column, difference in compressive strength exists between the cast-in-place and precast concrete. This research aims to investigate the behaviour of semi-precast concrete column by varying the compressive strength of the precast concrete. The semi-precast concrete columns were modeled in finite element analysis software as the connection between column and fondation models. The height of the column models were half of the real column 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>height,</b> based on the consideration that the elastic inflection point occurs at half the column 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>height.</b> For all column models, the compressive strength of the cast-in-place concrete was 20 MPa.

The column models were given constant axial loads and inclined lateral loads. The outputs of the finite element analysis software were lateral load-deflection relationship and crack pattern. Based on the analysis results, {{the magnitude of the}} lateral load and deflection of the column were proportional to the increment of concrete compressive strength.
