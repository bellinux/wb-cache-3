40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{process of}} <b>manure</b> <b>spreading</b> is an {{important}} step in cultivating land for agricultural production. For this rea-son, the technical process of <b>manure</b> <b>spreading</b> was studied using various methods of scientific research and analysis. The focus was primarily on improving the working principles of <b>manure</b> <b>spreading,</b> using so−called wide−angle manure spreaders. Results of the analysis of material transport along the rotor revealed the most relevant parameters of <b>manure</b> <b>spreading.</b> It was found that friction is not the most important parameter. The initial position of pieces of manure and the rotational frequen-cy of the rotor are far more important. The coefficient of friction between the rotor and pieces of manure has a minimum influ-ence on the tangential speed of a piece on the rotor, which in turn also means a minimum influence on the range of spreading. The initial position of the piece on the rotor has an influence on the tangential speed and travel of the piece on the rotor. The tangential speed of the piece as it departs from the rotor is influenced by the size of rotor and the rotational frequency of the rotor. Included are recommendations regarding the process of constructing a new spreading device or improving existing methods of spreading manure...|$|E
40|$|A need {{exists to}} improve the {{utilization}} of manure nutrients by minimizing NH 3 emissions from land application of manure. Management strategies to reduce NH 3 emissions are available; however, few have been validated under Canadian conditions. A well tested and accurate simulation model, however, can help overcome this challenge by determining appropriate management strategies for a given set of field conditions. The Volt'Air simulation model was utilized to estimate NH 3 volatilization from <b>manure</b> <b>spreading</b> for various <b>manure</b> <b>spreading</b> considerations under a range of atmospheric conditions typically encountered in eastern Canada. Considerations included: (i) soil liming, (ii) time of day of <b>manure</b> <b>spreading,</b> (iii) rainfall (timing and amount) and (iv) manure incorporation (timing, depth and manure coverage). Results demonstrated that liming to increase soil pH, increased NH 3 emissions by 3. 3 kg ha- 1 for each increment of 0. 1 pH (up to a 1. 5 total increase), over no liming at 34. 6 kg ha- 1. For each hour delay in <b>manure</b> <b>spreading</b> past 0800 h, NH 3 losses were reduced by 1. 5 kg ha- 1. Rainfall (10 mm) at least 20 h after manure application reduced losses, with increased reductions at higher rainfall amounts. Incorporation soon (1 h) after application was best for NH 3 mitigation. Increasing the depth of incorporation by 5 cm reduced NH 3 emissions by 4. 4 kg ha- 1; also increasing manure coverage by incorporation reduced losses by 2 kg ha- 1 for each 10 % increase in coverage, compared to surface application at 34. 6 kg ha- 1. This investigation using Volt'Air yielded valuable information about simulating manure management strategies and the magnitude of their effects on NH 3 emissions...|$|E

Animal manures are also commonly collected from barns and concentrated feeding areas for efficient re-use of many nutrients in crop production, sometimes after composting.

40|$|Livestock {{and poultry}} manure can provide {{valuable}} organic material and nutrients for crop and pasture growth. However, nutrients contained in animal manure can degrade water quality {{if they are}} overapplied to land and enter water resources through runoff or leaching. The nutrients of greatest water quality concern are nitrogen and phosphorus. Animal waste {{is a source of}} both. The past several decades have seen a shift in the livestock and poultry industry toward fewer, larger operations with a reduced amount of available cropland per animal on livestock and poultry farms (Gollehon et al., 2001). Concerns have consequently arisen that crops and other vegetation are not fully assimilating nutrients in manure, and that excess nutrients are increasingly likely to degrade nearby water resources. The land application rate—the quantity of <b>manure</b> <b>spread</b> on an acre of land—is believed to be the single most important manure management decision affecting the potential for contamination of water resources by manure nutrients (Mulla et al., 1999).

Both the retardation and the number of microorganisms transported into the subsurface are strongly conditioned by the interaction with soil and aquifer. This interaction often produces significant differences between microorganisms, due to differences in their properties for attachment to solid surface within both media.
