5|$|Mozart had a pet common {{starling}} {{which could}} sing {{part of his}} Piano Concerto in G Major (KV. 453). He had bought it from a shop after hearing it sing a phrase from a work he wrote six weeks previously, which {{had not yet been}} performed in public. He became very attached to the bird and arranged an elaborate funeral for it when it died three years later. It has been suggested that his A Musical Joke (K. 522) might be written in the comical, inconsequential style of a starling's vocalisation. Other people who have owned common starlings report how adept they are at picking up phrases and expressions. The words have no meaning for the starling, so they often <b>mix</b> <b>them</b> up or use them on what to humans are inappropriate occasions in their songs. Their ability at mimicry is so great that strangers have looked in vain for the human they think they have just heard speak.|$|E

[...] "I actually wasn't in [...] that much because they created an entire head. They did a live cast of {{me from the}} shoulders up. They created me and then put the teeth in", stated Fox. [...] "To save my face, they had a photo double that {{would come in and}} do most of the crazy monster makeup - they would do that on her.

500|$|In January 1981, {{the song}} [...] "Mr. Frump in the Iron Long" [...] was recorded. The song, an {{audience}} favorite from Yankovic's days playing in coffeehouses at Cal Poly, describes the rather lopsided {{relationship between the}} narrator and the eponymous [...] "Mr. Frump" [...] in his iron lung, until the latter's death. The final song, recorded on January 19, 1981, was [...] "Happy Birthday". A morbidly depressing birthday song detailing ails of the world, including poverty, nuclear holocaust, and eventual solar cataclysm, the song {{is based on the}} music of artist Tonio K. Only seeing two popular birthday songs at the time"Happy Birthday to You" [...] by Patty and Mildred J. Hill, and [...] "Birthday" [...] by The BeatlesYankovic decided to write his own [...] "severely twisted version of one". [...] "Happy Birthday' was recorded in the garage of Richard [...] "Bopcat" [...] Bennett, the brother of Schwartz who would go on to be a noted Nashville studio musician and record producer. All of the tracks, sans [...] "Another One Rides the Bus" [...] were recorded on a 4-track Portastudio; because only four tracks were available for mixing and recording, Yankovic had to carefully plan which parts of the songs he wanted to record at a time, and then <b>mix</b> <b>them</b> down before adding more song elements.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to exploration, combat is another major element to the gameplay, and the player must fight the various monsters that appear. In {{contrast to the}} more naïve everyman protagonists of previous games, combat in Homecoming takes into account Alex's experience as a soldier. The player is able to perform light and heavy attacks, or <b>mix</b> <b>them</b> to perform combinations, and may also perform a variety of finishing moves {{to ensure that the}} monsters are dead, a gameplay mechanic first featured in a rudimentary form in [...] Attacking enemies also leaves wounds in them that match the motion carried out by Alex in inflicting the attack. In terms of controlling Alex, the player may also perform new maneuvers such as targeting the enemy before attacking them, dodging enemy attacks, and performing counter-attacks. As well as melee weapons, pistols, rifles and shotguns are available as firearms, which can be upgraded to stronger versions later in the game: firearm handling is also rendered in a more realistic manner, with Alex having to shoulder long guns and suffering aim effects like recoil. In {{addition to}} the changes in combat, and unlike previous entries in the series, the player is also able to fully control and rotate the camera as they choose; one analog stick controls player movement, and the other controls the camera.|$|E

500|$|Amor Prohibido was {{recorded}} in its entirety at record producer Manny Guerra's studio in San Antonio, Texas and was engineered by house engineer Brian [...] "Red" [...] Moore. Pérez, wrote that the singer [...] "never complained about her mix or the sound onstage" [...] calling this [...] "rare" [...] among singers. He added that he never heard her say: [...] "I don't want to do that." [...] He said it was common for her {{to arrive at the}} studio during the album's production, [...] "hum her part a little", telling them not to worry about her because she will [...] "know what to do when [...] are ready to record", and then [...] "go off to shop at the mall." [...] Pérez said the band never [...] "had to ask [...] to change something in the studio" [...] as she [...] "track her vocals by herself, and she would be the one who would request a second take" [...] in order to [...] "add little harmonies she'd create" [...] during recording. Former keyboardist of the group, Rena Dearman provided several songs she wrote to A.B., who requested some material from her. A.B. favored [...] "I'll Be Alright" [...] and wanted Selena to record the song for Amor Prohibido, which was rejected by EMI Latin because [...] "it didn't fit the mood of the album." [...] for which A.B. later told her it could be included in Selena's next Tejano recording. The band's production sequence remain unchanged for Amor Prohibido. Selena and the band recorded their parts in the studio after they had first perfected them during pre-production. A.B. would then arrange and <b>mix</b> <b>them.</b> It took two weeks for Selena to record the album's ten tracks.|$|E
500|$|Telegraph Avenue, {{adapted from}} {{an idea for}} a TV series pilot that Chabon was asked to write in 1999, is a social novel set on the borders between Oakland and Berkeley in the summer of 2004 that sees a [...] "large cast of {{characters}} grapple with infidelity, fatherhood, crooked politicians, racism, nostalgia and buried secrets." [...] Chabon said upon publication {{in an interview with the}} San Francisco Chronicle that the novel concerns [...] "the possibility and impossibility of creating shared community spaces that attempt to transcend the limits imposed on us by our backgrounds, heritage and history." [...] Five years in gestation, Telegraph Avenue had a difficult birth, Chabon telling the Guardian newspaper, [...] "I got two years into the novel and got completely stymied and felt like it was an utter flop.... I had to start all over again, keeping the characters but reinventing the story completely and leaving behind almost every element." [...] After starting out with literary realism with his first two novels and moving into genre-fiction experiments from The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay onward, Chabon feels that Telegraph Avenue is a significant [...] "unification" [...] of his earlier and later styles, declaring in an interview, [...] "I could do whatever I wanted to do in this book and it would be OK even if it verged on crime fiction, even if it verged on magic realism, even if it verged on martial arts fiction.... I was open to all of that and yet I didn't have to repudiate or steer away from the naturalistic story about two families living their everyday lives and coping with pregnancy and birth and adultery and business failure and all the issues that might go into making a novel written in the genre of mainstream quote-unquote realistic fiction, that that was another genre for me now and I felt free to <b>mix</b> <b>them</b> all in a sense." [...] The novel has been optioned by film producer Scott Rudin (who previously optioned and produced Wonder Boys), and Cameron Crowe is adapting the novel into a screenplay, according to Chabon.|$|E

2500|$|Mary Henle {{noted in}} her presidential address to Division 24 {{at the meeting}} of the American Psychological Association (1975): [...] "What Perls has done has been to take a few terms from Gestalt psychology, stretch their meaning beyond recognition, <b>mix</b> <b>them</b> with notions—often unclear and often incompatible—from the depth psychologies, existentialism, and common sense, and he has called the whole mixture gestalt therapy. His work has no {{substantive}} relation to scientific Gestalt psychology. To use his own language, Fritz Perls has done 'his thing'; whatever it is, it is not Gestalt psychology" [...] With the [...] however, she restricts herself explicitly to only three of Perls' books from 1969 and 1972, leaving out Perls' earlier work, and Gestalt therapy in general.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his first}} opera, Huang Ruo {{has sought to}} develop the {{synthesis}} of Chinese and Western elements already found in his previous works; his aim {{is not so much}} to <b>mix</b> <b>them</b> as to achieve an organic unity, and—to the extent that here he has composed for Western-style operatic voices singing Mandarin words—he succeeds. His vocal lines are apparently influenced not by traditional Chinese opera but by (local to Hong Kong) Cantonese narrative singing, with one syllable to one note, departing from standard Western vocalism. But the most obvious musical feature of Dr. Sun is the scoring for traditional Chinese instruments (Huang [...] Ruo has made two versions, with an alternative for Western orchestra), realised here with subtlety by the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra under the conductor Yan Huichang. Some of the Chinese reviewers are said to have dismissed this as a gimmick, but this colourful soundworld did not distract from the substance of the work.|$|E

2500|$|Del Toro {{has said}} the film has strong {{connections}} in theme to The Devil's Backbone and {{should be seen as}} an informal sequel dealing with some of the issues raised there. Fernando Tielve and Íñigo Garcés, who played the protagonists of The Devil's Backbone, make cameo appearances as unnamed guerrilla soldiers in Pan's Labyrinth. Some of the other works he drew on for inspiration include Lewis Carroll's Alice books, Jorge Luis Borges' Ficciones, Arthur Machen's The Great God Pan and The White People, Lord Dunsany's The Blessing of Pan, Algernon Blackwood's Pan's Garden and Francisco Goya's works. In 2004, del Toro said: [...] "Pan is an original story. Some of my favourite writers (Borges, Blackwood, Machen, Dunsany) have explored the figure of the god Pan and the symbol of the labyrinth. These are things that I find very compelling and I am trying to <b>mix</b> <b>them</b> and play with them." [...] It was also influenced by the illustrations of Arthur Rackham.|$|E
2500|$|DJs use {{equipment}} that can play {{at least two}} sources of recorded music simultaneously and <b>mix</b> <b>them</b> together. This allows the DJ to create seamless transitions between recordings and develop unique mixes of songs. Often, this involves aligning the beats of the music sources so their rhythms do not clash when they are played together, either so two records can be played at the same time, or to enable the DJ to make a smooth transition from one song to another. An important tool for DJs is the specialized DJ mixer, a small audio mixer with a crossfader [...] and cue functions. The crossfader enables the DJ to blend or transition from one song to another. The cue knobs or switches allow the DJ to pre-listen to a source of recorded music in headphones before playing it for the live club or broadcast audience. Previewing the music in headphones helps the DJ pick the next track they want to play and cue up the track to the desired starting location so it will mix well with the currently playing music. DJs may also use a microphone {{to speak to the}} audience; effects units such as reverb to create sound effects; and electronic musical instruments such as drum machines and synthesizers.|$|E
