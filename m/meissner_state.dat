50|$|It {{has been}} {{predicted}} that when two different bands of electrons yield two quasiparticles, {{one of which}} has a coherence length that would indicate type I superconductivity and one of which would indicate type II, then in certain cases, vortices attract at long distances and repel at short distances. In particular, the potential energy between vortices is minimized at a critical distance. As a consequence there is a conjectured new phase called the semi-Meissner state, in which vortices are separated by the critical distance. When the applied flux is {{too small for the}} entire superconductor to be filled with a lattice of vortices separated by the critical distance, then there are large regions of type I superconductivity, a <b>Meissner</b> <b>state,</b> separating these domains.|$|E
5000|$|Superconductors in the <b>Meissner</b> <b>state</b> exhibit perfect diamagnetism, or superdiamagnetism, {{meaning that}} the total {{magnetic}} field {{is very close to}} zero deep inside them (many penetration depths from the surface).

Diamagnetics are defined by the generation of a spontaneous magnetization of a material which directly opposes the direction of an applied field. However, the fundamental origins of diamagnetism in superconductors and normal materials are very different. In normal materials diamagnetism arises {{as a direct result of}} the orbital spin of electrons about the nuclei of an atom induced electromagnetically by the application of an applied field. In superconductors the illusion of perfect diamagnetism arises from persistent screening currents which flow to oppose the applied field (the Meissner effect); not solely the orbital spin.|$|E

40|$|Using a perturbative {{approach}} to the infinitely degenerate Bogomolnyi vortex state for a superconductor with kappa = 2 ^(- 1 / 2), T -> T_c, we calculate the interaction of vortices in a superconductor with kappa close to 2 ^(- 1 / 2). We find, numerically and analytically, that depending on the material the interaction potential between the vortices varies with decreasing kappa from purely repulsive (as in a type-II superconductor) to purely attractive (as in a type-I superconductor) in two different ways: either vortices form a bound state and {{the distance between them}} changes gradually from infinity to zero, or this transition occurs in a discontinuous way {{as a result of a}} competition between minima at infinity and zero.

50|$|Type-II superconductors, {{besides the}} <b>Meissner</b> <b>state,</b> possess another state: a {{sufficiently}} strong {{applied magnetic field}} can produce currents {{in the interior of}} superconductor due to formation of quantum vortices. The vortices also carry magnetic flux through the interior of the superconductor. These quantum vortices repel each other and thus tend to form uniform vortex lattices or liquids. Formally, vortex solutions exist also in models of type-I superconductivity, but the interaction between vortices is purely attractive, so a system of many vortices is unstable against a collapse onto a state of a single giant normal domain with supercurrent flowing on its surface. More importantly, the vortices in type-I superconductor are energetically unfavorable. To produce them would require the application of a magnetic field stronger than what a superconducting condensate can sustain. Thus a type-I superconductor goes to non-superconducting states rather than forming vortices. In the usual Ginzburg-Landau theory, only the quantum vortices with purely repulsive interaction are energetically cheap enough to be induced by applied magnetic field.|$|E
5000|$|Type-1.5 superconductors are {{multicomponent}} superconductors {{characterized by}} two or more coherence lengths, {{at least one of}} which is shorter than the magnetic field penetration length , and at least one of which is longer.

They allow magnetic field to pass through superconductors due to a vortex-like circulation of superconducting particles (electronic pairs). In type-1.5 superconductors these vortices have long-range attractive, short-range repulsive interaction. As a consequence type-1.5 superconductor in magnetic field can form a phase separation into domains with expelled magnetic field and clusters of quantum vortices which are bound together by attractive intervortex forces. The domains of the <b>Meissner</b> <b>state</b> retain the two-component superconductivity, while in the vortex clusters one of the superconducting components is suppressed. Thus such materials should allow coexistence of various properties of type-I and type-II superconductors.|$|E
