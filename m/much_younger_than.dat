5|$|In Madison Park, Seattle, {{a family}} are {{gathered}} around the television. The mother leaves to go to bed, and {{the atmosphere in the}} room grows tense. The older of two sisters, Connie Bangs (Michelle Joyner) takes her sister Sara—who is clearly <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> she is—to her bedroom and locks her in, warning her not to let her father inside. Connie runs out of the house, fighting off her father, and is later found wandering the streets confused. She is taken to clinical social worker Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher), and admits that her father has been sexually abusing her for years.|$|E
5|$|It {{was long}} assumed that Vulcanodon lived during the {{lowermost}} (earliest) {{part of the}} Jurassic (the Hettangian stage) or at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, approximately 200 million years ago. Therefore, it was regarded as the earliest sauropod known, until {{the discovery of the}} even older Late Triassic Isanosaurus was announced in 2000. Adam Yates (2004) has recently shown that Vulcanodon is actually <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> previously thought, dating to the uppermost (latest) part of the Lower Jurassic during the Toarcian stage, approximately 175–183 million years ago. – thus, it is contemporary to the closely related Tazoudasaurus. Although the locality of Vulcanodon itself cannot be dated radiometrically because of weathering of the lavas, it would roughly be a contemporary to Karoo lavas from other localities, as the entire sequence of volcanic eruptions was finished within one million years.|$|E
25|$|Captive {{killer whales}} often give birth at a <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> age <b>than</b> in the wild, {{sometimes}} {{as young as}} age seven. The young mothers may have difficulty raising their offspring. The calves have a relatively low survival rate, though some have lived into adulthood.|$|R
6000|$|That word [...] "Youth," [...] as {{the reader}} has perhaps already guessed, was my wife's pet name for me. It was gently satirical, but also affectionate. I had certain mental and {{material}} peculiarities and customs proper to a <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> person <b>than</b> I was.|$|R

This draws the attention of Tenjin, who has a fetish for [...] "little sister" [...] types. Unfortunately for Tenjin, his unusual and over-enthusiastic advances only frighten Sanae away. It is implied that Sanae begins to develop feelings for Yuusuke after he helps her.|$|R
5|$|John Stainer was {{the eighth}} of nine {{children}} born to William Stainer and his wife Ann (née Collier) on 6 June 1840. At least three of the children died in infancy, and John was <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> his brother, William, and his three sisters, Ann, Sarah and Mary. The family lived in Southwark, London, where {{his father was a}} cabinet maker and later a vestry clerk and registrar of births. He was also an untaught musician and player of the piano, violin and flute. He built a small chamber organ at home on which the precocious John used to accompany him when he played hymn tunes on the violin. His sister Ann also used it – she was the regular organist at Magdalen Hospital, Streatham. It was a happy family, and young John seems to have been spoiled by his elders. He was precocious and could play Bach's Fugue in E major at the age of seven.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{appears to}} have been unimpressed by this plan. She felt that marrying the son of a count diminished her {{imperial}} status and was probably also unhappy about marrying someone so <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> she was; Matilda was 25 and Geoffrey was only 13. Hildebert, the Archbishop of Tours, eventually intervened to persuade her {{to go along with the}} engagement. Matilda finally agreed, and she travelled to Rouen in May 1127 with Robert of Gloucester and Brian Fitz Count where she was formally betrothed to Geoffrey. Over the course of the next year, Fulk decided to depart for Jerusalem, where he hoped to become king, leaving his possessions to Geoffrey. Henry knighted his future son-in-law, and Matilda and Geoffrey were married a week later on 17 June 1128 in Le Mans by the bishops of Le Mans and Séez. Fulk finally left Anjou for Jerusalem in 1129, declaring Geoffrey the Count of Anjou and Maine.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2004 {{arrival of}} the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft, the rings of Saturn were widely thought to be <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> the Solar System and were not {{expected}} to survive beyond another 300million years. Gravitational interactions with Saturn's moons were expected to gradually sweep the rings' outer edge toward the planet, with abrasion by meteorites and Saturn's gravity eventually taking the rest, leaving Saturn unadorned. However, data from the Cassini mission led scientists to revise that early view. Observations revealed 10km-wide icy clumps of material that repeatedly break apart and reform, keeping the rings fresh. Saturn's rings are far more massive than the rings of the other giant planets. This large mass {{is thought to have}} preserved Saturn's rings since it first formed 4.5billion years ago, and is likely to preserve them for billions of years to come.|$|E
50|$|Two recent {{epidemiologic}} {{studies in}} the United States (PROS and NMANES III) highlighted a recent unexpected advance in sexual maturation in girls. American, European and Asian studies suggest breast development in girls occurs at a <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> age <b>than</b> a few decades ago, irrespective of race and socioeconomic conditions. Environmental chemical exposure {{is one of the}} factors implicated in the recent downward trend of earlier sexual maturation.|$|R

This was located in the Galleria Passarella and targeted a <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> clientele <b>than</b> was typical for Italian retailing of the time. Fiorucci stocked London designers such as Ossie Clark, {{as well as the}} typical hippie uniform of Afghan coat. The store became an eclectic mix of eccentricities - everything from rag rugs and kettles to hair products and clothing.|$|R
5|$|Six {{months after}} the last series, Rachel returns from London and tells Adam that she aborted the baby, and their {{relationship}} seems over for good. They both start seeing other people—he one of Pete's colleagues (Rosie Cavaliero) and she a man <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> her (Hugh Dancy)—but reconcile after Adam is diagnosed and treated for testicular cancer in Episode 5. David is made redundant at work and decides to be a stay-at-home dad for Josh. After some interference from Karen, he takes a new job. Their relationship improves from the first series; they spend their wedding anniversary in Paris and Karen announces in Episode 6 that she is pregnant. Pete and Jenny's marriage deteriorates when she reveals she {{had a crush on}} Adam. Pete later sleeps with a co-worker— with whom Adam was also briefly involved—and Jenny tells him {{to move out of the}} house. They decide to give their marriage another chance when Adam's cancer puts things into perspective. In Episode 6, all three couples see in the new millennium on a trip to Lindisfarne, where Pete and Jenny's relationship worsens again as the others' improve.|$|E

60|$|To her surprise, Miss Fosbrook {{received}} {{a very pleasant}} civil greeting from a <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> man <b>than</b> she had expected to see, looking perhaps more stern about the mouth and sharp about the eye than his elder brother, and his clerical dress very precise; but somehow he was so curiously like his niece, Elizabeth, that she thought that his particularity might spring from the same love of refinement.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Kennedy was a <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> woman <b>than</b> Grandmother Newbury. She was {{certainly}} {{no more than}} fifty and, {{in spite of her}} grey hair, looked almost girlish, so bright were her dark eyes, so clear-cut and fresh her delicate face, and so smart her general appearance. Frances, although not given to sudden likings, took one for Mrs. Kennedy. She thought she had never seen so charming a face.|$|R
60|$|The {{events of}} such a day might have worn out the body and spirit of a <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> man <b>than</b> he, but he sat in deep and painful {{meditation}} until the morning was bright. Nor did he even then seek any prolonged repose, but merely slumbered in his chair, until seven o'clock, when Mr Tapley had appointed to come {{to him by his}} desire; and came--as fresh and clean and cheerful as the morning itself.|$|R
25|$|The age of Ithaca Chasma is {{estimated}} to be either 4.0 or 0.4–3.3 billion years depending on chosen impact chronology. The crater counts indicate that the chasma is slightly older than Odysseus crater but <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> the cratered plains.|$|E

Tackleton tells John Peerybingle that his wife Dot has cheated on him, and shows him a clandestine scene in which Dot embraces the mysterious lodger; the latter, who is in disguise, is {{actually}} a <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> man <b>than</b> he seems. John is cut to the heart over this as he loves his wife dearly, but decides after some deliberations to relieve his wife of their marriage contract.|$|R
50|$|In the 1957 screen {{adaptation}} of Miller's piece, he was depicted by Yves Brainville. In the 1996 {{film version of}} the play, he was portrayed by Rob Campbell, as a <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> man <b>than</b> would have been historically accurate, as Hale was fifty-six {{at the time of}} the trials. His wife is accused by Abigail Williams once she begins to suspect him of doubting her claims. This is quickly dismissed by Danforth, leading to Abigail escaping from the village. He then later sadly witnessed the hanging of Rebecca Nurse, Martha Corey and John Proctor.|$|R
25|$|The Indigenous {{population}} of Australia is <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> the non-Indigenous population, {{with an estimated}} median age of 21 years (37 years for non-Indigenous), due to higher rates of birth and death.

By this time, the original age discrepancies were reversed, with Ralph married to a <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> Alice <b>than</b> himself. Gleason {{was one of several}} big names in entertainment determined to break the curse of the blacklist as many rejected the Red Scare of the 1950s as straight hysteria.|$|R

50|$|The {{region is}} formed from Late Cambrian {{sandstone}} deposited 500 {{million years ago}} at the bottom of shallow inland seas. During the Wisconsin glaciation between 20,000 and 10,000 years ago a glacial lobe passed just east of the park. Dell Creek, a tributary of the Wisconsin River {{is believed to have been}} blocked by outwash sediments and diverted northeast. Over time it cut a deep, narrow ravine into the easily eroded sandstone. The steep cliffs indicate that this section of Dell Creek is <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> geologically <b>than</b> upstream, where the banks have eroded longer and are more gently sloping.|$|R
25|$|Amsterdam is <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> Dutch {{cities such}} as Nijmegen, Rotterdam, and Utrecht. In October 2008, {{historical}} geographer Chris de Bont suggested that the land around Amsterdam was being reclaimed {{as early as the}} late 10th century. This {{does not necessarily mean that}} there was already a settlement then, since reclamation of land may not have been for farming—it may have been for peat, for use as fuel.|$|E

He is <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> his middle-aged boyfriend {{and as such}} Colin's role is almost paternal. Barry is open about his sexuality to everyone except his volatile father — and when he is finally told he takes the news so badly that Barry turns straight just to appease him — although he is never very successful at it.|$|E

Newman did, though, warn readers that the novel was not autobiographical and that no identification of characters should be made.|$|E
50|$|The {{unique design}} of the LEA tests and their special optotypes allow for {{pediatric}} low vision to be diagnosed in children at <b>much</b> <b>younger</b> ages <b>than</b> standard vision tests allow. This is especially important in young children who possess other physical disabilities or mental disabilities and are entitled to receive early special education benefits. More than half of children who suffer from low vision also have other impairments or disabilities.
