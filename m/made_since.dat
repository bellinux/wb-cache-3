5|$|Attempts at {{forming an}} alumni {{association}} had been <b>made</b> <b>since</b> 1896; a charter {{was applied for}} by J. B. McCrary and William H. Glenn on June 28, 1906 and was approved by Fulton County on June 20, 1908. The Georgia Tech Alumni Association published its first annual report in 1908, but the group was largely dormant during World War I. The organization {{played an important role}} in the 1920s Greater Georgia Tech Campaign, which consolidated all existing alumni clubs and funded a significant expansion of Georgia Tech's campus.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} a clause both of whose {{variables}} are already set, {{in a way that}} falsifies the clause, then the algorithm backtracks to its most recent choice point, undoing the assignments it <b>made</b> <b>since</b> that choice, and reverses the decision made at that choice. If there is no choice point, or if the algorithm has already backtracked over the most recent choice point, then it aborts the search and reports that the input 2-CNF formula is unsatisfiable.|$|E

5|$|It is {{reported}} that this {{problem with the}} CL contributed to the bankruptcy of the cable company in 1888. However, electric motor traction had been considered all along, and much engineering progress had been <b>made</b> <b>since</b> the tunnel's construction had begun in 1886. So, CL chairman Charles Grey Mott decided to switch to electric traction. Other cable-operated systems using the Hallidie patents continued to be designed, such as the Glasgow Subway which opened in 1896.|$|E
5|$|Mississippi Highway 350 (MS 350) is {{a highway}} in extreme {{northern}} Mississippi. Its western terminus is at MS 2 near Corinth. The road travels near the Tennessee state line to its eastern terminus at MS 25. The route was designated in 1981, and no significant {{changes have been}} <b>made</b> <b>since.</b>|$|E
5|$|On November 19, 2009, John Green, one of {{the fans}} who helped begin the brawl, {{appeared}} on ESPN First Take, where {{he talked about the}} incident and the changes he had <b>made</b> <b>since</b> then. Green recounted that he had an alcohol problem at the time and had since made an effort to deal with that. He also said that Ron Artest had apologized to him several months earlier, and wished to work together in some type of community service in Detroit.|$|E

5|$|Proposals for {{the line}} have been <b>made</b> <b>since</b> the {{extension}} to Østerås. The current municipal master {{plan calls for}} the line to be extended to Bekkestua Station, where it would again intersect with the Kolsås Line. One possibility is also that the service be continued along the Kolsås Line and a new branch be built to Sandvika, the municipal center of Bærum. However, an extension {{has not been a}} priority for the municipal politicians, although the right-of-way has been secured, which will simplify construction.|$|E
5|$|Renewed popular {{interest}} in Old Polish cuisine {{has resulted in}} reprints being <b>made</b> <b>since</b> {{the turn of the}} 21st century, including a limited bibliophile edition of 500 numbered leather-bound volumes published in 2002 in Jędrzejów. In 2009, the Wilanów Palace Museum in Warsaw published a critical edition with a broad introduction by food historian Jarosław Dumanowski presenting Czerniecki's life and work.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{progress}} in Big Bang cosmology has been <b>made</b> <b>since</b> the late 1990s {{as a result}} of advances in telescope technology as well as the analysis of data from satellites such as COBE, the Hubble Space Telescope and WMAP. Cosmologists now have fairly precise and accurate measurements of many of the parameters of the Big Bang model, and have made the unexpected discovery that {{the expansion of the universe}} appears to be accelerating.|$|E

5|$|The first {{change to}} the highway's {{alignment}} occurred on November 1, 1966, when SH-51 was straightened between Stillwater and Yale; SH-108 was realigned to continue to concur with SH-51. Around the same time, the remainder of SH-108 was paved. The final change to SH-108 was made on June 4, 1974, when a straightening of SH-33 resulted in a slight extension of SH-108 to continue to meet the new highway. No changes have been <b>made</b> <b>since.</b>|$|E
5|$|U.S. Route 5 was {{designated}} in 1926 along the Route 2 alignment. Between 1926 and 1932, U.S. Route 5 and Route 2 were co-signed throughout {{the length of}} the route. In the 1932 state highway renumbering, the Route 2 designation was removed, leaving only the US 5 designation. Only a small number of changes have been <b>made</b> <b>since</b> then, the most prominent being in the cities of New Haven and Hartford.|$|E

5|$|Upon death, the Slugcat {{returns to}} the last {{hibernation}} save point and loses any map progress <b>made</b> <b>since.</b> The player also loses a karma point, which are indicated {{at the bottom of}} the screen. The player needs to meet a karmic threshold to reach specific areas of the game. Karma is restored upon reaching a new hibernation area, and the player can shield their current karma level by eating a yellow flower. The flower appears at the start of each area and is re-planted wherever the Slugcat dies.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the awards in 1975, seven {{categories}} were presented: Best Novel, Best Short Fiction, Best Collection, Best Artist, Special Award—Professional, Special Award—Non-professional, and Life Achievement. Only a few categories have changed since then, and no changes have been made to the rules. 1978 saw the addition of the Convention Award, a special award given for general contributions to the genre, and the only award not given every year since the beginning. The Short Fiction award was split into Short Story and Novella awards in 1982, and in 1988 the multi-author anthologies, previously eligible for the Collection award, were split into their own Best Anthology category. No changes have been <b>made</b> <b>since.</b>|$|E
5|$|By May 2015, {{the games}} were under a {{particularly}} dark cloud because of the 2015 FIFA corruption case, allegations and criminal charges of bribery, fraud and money laundering to corrupt the issuing of media and marketing rights (rigged bids) for FIFA games, with FIFA officials accused of taking bribes totaling more than $150 million over 24 years. In late May, the U.S. Justice Department announced a 47-count indictment with charges of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy against 14 people. Arrests of over a dozen FIFA officials were <b>made</b> <b>since</b> that time, particularly on May 29 and December 3. By the end of May 2015, a total of nine FIFA officials and five executives of sports and broadcasting markets had already been charged on corruption. At the time, FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced he would relinquish his position in February 2016.|$|E

5|$|Dishonored 2 was {{released}} {{to a positive}} reception. Praised were the improvements <b>made</b> <b>since</b> the first game: the more challenging stealth, the adaptability of Emily and Corvo's abilities to both play styles, the art direction, the creative design of individual missions, {{the realization of the}} game's world as well as the replay-value and the artificial intelligence. Criticism was directed at the lack of focus of the overarching narrative. Aside from this, technical blunders as well as issues with the PC version were received unfavorably. Dishonored 2 won the award for Best Action/Adventure Game at The Game Awards 2016 and for Costume Design at the 2017 NAVGTR Awards.|$|E
5|$|Further {{investments}} beyond {{construction of}} the new terminal were planned since 2007 for bulk cargo terminal equipment worth €80M, cargo terminal equipment worth €11million, replacement of equipment in pre-2007 port facilities valued at €26million and re{{construction of the}} liquid cargo terminal worth €70million. These investments were originally scheduled for 20072014, but the pace of development is slower than expected, and delays of a year to two had been observed by 2010. The required superstructure is planned to be funded through build-operate-transfer contracts and public–private partnerships. The investments <b>made</b> <b>since</b> 2007 and those planned as of 2011 are aimed at increasing the port's throughput from 8 to 10million tonnes of cargo per year.|$|E
5|$|Hubble {{has helped}} resolve some long-standing {{problems}} in astronomy, {{as well as}} raising new questions. Some results have required new theories to explain them. Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to Cepheid variable stars more accurately than ever before, and thus constrain {{the value of the}} Hubble constant, the measure of {{the rate at which the}} universe is expanding, which is also related to its age. Before the launch of HST, estimates of the Hubble constant typically had errors of up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in the Virgo Cluster and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of ±10%, which is consistent with other more accurate measurements <b>made</b> <b>since</b> Hubble's launch using other techniques. The estimated age is now about 13.7 billion years, but before the Hubble Telescope scientists predicted an age ranging from 10 to 20 billion years.|$|E
