The adaptive control system begins from a "baseline " dynamic model of the plant, which is updated as the system is operated. This allows the control inputs to be tailored to the observed behavior of the system {{across a range of}} variables, while accounting for uncertainty. In an aircraft wing, for example, this would include flight conditions, weight distribution, and failure characteristics as well as uncertainty in structural dynamics and aerodynamics. An MRAC scheme was implemented in Python and tested for several simple wing problems, showing superb tracking in each case.

40|$|Abstract We {{introduce}} a new method to determine the magnitude of completeness <b>M</b> <b>c</b> and its uncertainty. Our method models the entire magnitude range (EMR method) consisting of the self-similar complete part of the frequency-magnitude distribution and the incomplete portion, thus providing a comprehensive seismicity model. We compare the EMR method with three existing techniques, finding that EMR shows a superior performance when applied to synthetic test cases or real data from regional and global earthquake catalogues. This method, however, {{is also the most}} computationally intensive. Accurate knowledge of <b>M</b> <b>c</b> is essential for many seismicity-based studies, and particularly for mapping out seismicity parameters such as the b-value of the Gutenberg-Richter relationship. By explicitly computing the uncertainties in <b>M</b> <b>c</b> using a bootstrap approach, we show that uncertainties in b-values are larger than traditionally assumed, especially when considering small sample sizes. As examples, we investigated temporal variations of <b>M</b> <b>c</b> for the 1992 Landers aftershock sequence and found that it was underestimated on average by 0. 2 with former techniques. Mapping <b>M</b> <b>c</b> on a global scale, <b>M</b> <b>c</b> reveals considerable spatial variations for the Harvard Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT) (5. 3 � <b>M</b> <b>c</b> � 6. 0) and the International Seismological Centre (ISC) catalogue (4. 3 � <b>M</b> <b>c</b> � 5. 0) ...|$|R

The spectra of the reduced enzyme show a strong negative c. d. band peaking at 1100 nm arising from low-spin ferrous haem a and a positive <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. peak at 780 nm assigned to high-spin ferrous haem a 3. Addition of cyanide ion doubles the intensity of the low-spin ferrous haem c. d. band and abolishes reduced carbonmonoxy derivative the haem a 32 +-CO group shows no <b>c.</b> d. or <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. bands at wavelengths longer than 700 nm. A comparison of the <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. spectra of the oxidized and cyanide-bound oxidized forms enables bands characteristic of the high-spin ferric form of haem a 33 + to be identified between 700 and 1300 nm. At wavelengths longer than 1300 nm a broad positive <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. spectrum, peaking at 1600 nm, is observed. By comparison with the <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. spectrum of an extracted haem a-bis-imidazole complex this <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> d. peak is assigned to one low-spin ferric haem, namely haem a 3 +.

Pigs showed migrating myoelectric complexes (<b>m.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> s) {{in the small}} intestine both when fasted and after feeding. The <b>m.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> s were modified by feeding; quiescence was much reduced in duration and irregular spiking activity (i. s. a.) was prolonged; <b>m.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> s were not disrupted and phases of regular spiking activity (r. s. a.) were still seen after feeding. The r. s. a. phase could be recognized {{on the screen and}} in spot films from both fasting and fed pigs as a band of intense rhythmic contractions pinching off the intestine and propelling all intestinal contents ahead of it. The r. s. a. moved caudad clearing the small intestine of digesta and leaving an empty quiescent intestine behind it. It was particularly characteristic in the fasted pig where it was usually associated with the progression of a gas bubble. The pattern of <b>m.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> s in both fasted and fed animals along with the intermittent nature of stomach emptying, divided digesta into batches which progressed through the small intestine. Each batch [...] propelled by a <b>m.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> [...] normally took 180 - 190 min to pass through the small intestine. <b>M.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> s had a cycle length of 70 - 115 min {{in different parts of the}} small intestine. Usually two or three <b>m.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> s and batches of intestinal contents were present in the small intestine at any one time. 22 - 33 % of the <b>m.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> s faded out in the proximal ileum. Batches of digesta propelled by these <b>m.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> s had transit times increased by one <b>m.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> duration and fused with the subsequent batch. Sometimes new <b>m.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>c.</b> s were generated in the terminal ileum. Two patterns of transport into the large intestine were seen. Usually digesta was transported by peristaltic rushes starting 100 - 200 cm from the ileo-caecal junction. The rush then continued through 1 - 1 1 / 2 turns of the spiral colon; occasionally the terminal ileum emptied by slow peristalsis. In this case there was no colonic rush and digesta went into the caecum...|$|R
