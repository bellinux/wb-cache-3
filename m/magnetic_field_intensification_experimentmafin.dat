40|$|Recent spectro-polarimetric {{observations}} {{have provided}} detailed measurements of <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> velocity and intensity during events of <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> <b>intensification</b> {{in the solar}} photosphere. We consider the temporal evolution of the relevant physical quantities for three cases of <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> <b>intensification</b> in a numerical simulation. We determine {{the evolution of the}} intensity, magnetic flux density and zero-crossing velocity derived from the synthetic Stokes parameters by taking into account the spectral and spatial resolution of the spectropolarimeter (SP) on board Hinode. The three events considered show a similar evolution: advection of magnetic flux to a granular vertex, development of a strong downflow, evacuation of the magnetic feature, increase of the field strength and the appearance of the bright point. We find that synthetic and real observations are qualitatively consistent and, for one of the cases considered, agree very well also quantitatively. The effect of finite resolution (spatial smearing) is most pronounced in the case of small features, for which the synthetic Hinode/SP observations miss the bright point formation and also the high-velocity downflows during the formation of the smaller magnetic features.

Cyclonic and anti-cyclonic convection vortices, which rotate, respectively, in the same and opposite directions of the system rotation, are generated and play a primary role in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> <b>intensification.</b> The <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is enhanced through the stretching of magnetic lines of force in four particular places of the convection fields, namely, inside anti-cyclones, between cyclones and their western neighbouring anti-cyclones at middle as well as low latitudes, and between anti-cyclones and the outer boundary.

40|$|Solar <b>{{magnetic}}</b> <b>fields</b> span a {{wide range}} of spatial scales from sunspots and plages to magnetic bright points. A clear understanding of the physical processes underlying the evolution of these magnetic features requires high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of solar active regions and comparisons with synthetic data from simulations. This thesis is based on observations with the Swedish 1 -m Solar Telescope (SST) and the CRISP imaging spectropolarimeter which, processed with a sophisticated image restoration technique, produce data of unsurpassed quality. The Fe I 630. 25 nm line is used for all the spectropolarimetric observations. It appears likely that present telescopes resolve the fundamental scales of penumbral filaments. However, the penumbrae of sunspots are still not fully understood, with various theoretical models competing to explain their fine structure and flows. We analyze spectropolarimetric observations with a resolution close to the SST diffraction limit of 0. 16 arcsecond. Using inversion techniques, we map the line-of-sight velocities and the magnetic-field configuration of dark-cored penumbral filaments. Over the past decade, sunspots and quiet sun <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> have received considerable attention, with intermediate plage regions being somewhat neglected. We perform a detailed analysis of a plage region and present the first observational evidence of a small-scale granular magneto-convection pattern associated with a plage region. Magnetic bright points are believed to be formed due to <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> <b>intensification</b> caused by flux-tube collapse involving strong downflows. Although magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations agree with this view, only a few observations with adequate spatial resolution exist in support of the simulations. We present several cases of bright-point formation associated with strong downflows, which qualitatively agree with simulations and past observations.

Theoretical models, numerical calculations, and simulations describing the formation of these features have existed for a few decades, but {{there are only a}} few observational studies in direct support of the simulations. In this study we present the evolution of small-scale magnetic features with a spatial resolution close to 0. 15 arcsecond and compare these observations with those predicted by numerical simulations and also with previous observational work of a similar nature. We analyze a 40 min time sequence of full Stokes spectropolarimetric 630. 25 nm data from a plage region near the Sun center. We use line-of-sight velocities and <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> measurements obtained using Milne-Eddington inversion techniques with and without stray-light compensation along with measured continuum and line minimum intensities. We discuss the results in relation to earlier observations and simulations. We present eight cases involving strong downflows and <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> <b>intensification.</b> All cases studied are associated with the formation of a bright point in the continuum. In three out of the eight cases we find the presence of weak opposite polarity field in close proximity to the downflow. Our data are consistent with earlier simulations describing flux tube collapse, but the transition to a state with stronger field appears transient and short-lived, rather than resulting in a permanent <b>field</b> <b>intensification.</b> Three cases of weak opposite polarity field found adjacent to the downflows do not appear related to reconnection but may be related to overturning convection pulling down some field lines and leading to up/down "serpentine" field, as seen in some simulations.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the problem of molecules and the horizontal balance of forces in sunspots. Sunspots are quasi-static features on the solar surface and can be considered to be in a state of equilibrium. The weaker gas pressure of the cool sunspot interior is horizontally supported against the higher pressure of the hotter quiet-Sun by a strong vertical <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> However, some sunspots show a rapid increase in magnetic pressure relative to the temperature of the gas in the coolest regions of the sunspot, implying that an isothermal decrease in the gas pressure must have occurred. The current model of sunspots is unable to describe this deviation from the assumed equilibrium state of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and thermal gas pressure observed in these sunspots. Another method of altering the pressure of the gas must be occurring. The formation of molecules in sunspots may be the key to solving this puzzle. The sunspot interior provides a cool environment where molecules can form in abundance. As atoms become bound into molecules the total particle number of the gas is decreased. A sufficiently large molecular fraction could significantly alter the properties of the sunspot plasma, and specifically provide a mechanism for concentrating the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> by non-thermally lowering the gas pressure. I have investigated the equilibrium condition of sunspots of different sizes and in a variety of evolutionary phases through a Milne-Eddington inversion of spectropolarimetric observations of the Zeeman-split Fe I lines at 6302 and 15650 A to obtain their thermal and magnetic topology. I carried out a calculation of the detailed radiative transfer and chemical equilibrium of model sunspot atmospheres to determine the molecular gas fraction. Several sunspots show unambiguous cases of isothermal <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> <b>intensification,</b> which can only be explained by the formation or destruction of a large molecular population. All sunspots with <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> stronger than 2500 G and temperatures cooler than 5800 K consistently show a signature of <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> over-concentration, consistent with molecular hydrogen formation of a few percent of the total gas fraction.

There is a maximum frequency of AC sinusoidal <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> for a given <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> strength, and a minimum strength of AC sinusoidal <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> for a given frequency of AC sinusoidal <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> to realize the MR effect. When the frequency of AC sinusoidal <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is over the maximum frequency or the applied strength of AC sinusoidal <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> {{is less than the}} minimum strength of AC sinusoidal <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> the MR activity almost completely disappears and the dynamic behavior of the disk-type MR fluid dampers under AC <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is the same as that without <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> Since the AC sinusoidal <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> applied in the disk-type MR fluid damper results in the amplitude-modulated phenomenon in the rotor motion, it is better to use the DC <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> than to use the AC sinusoidal <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> to control the dynamic behavior of the disk-type MR fluid dampers in the rotor vibration control of view.

According to {{researching the}} spin {{traveling}} wave pump, {{the relationship of}} the characteristics of magnetic fluid and the press is investigated under the spin <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> by the theory method. The relationship of moving, <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and press is investigated by the decoupled computation between the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and force. The method is scientificity and rationality by the testing. The distributing shape of magnetic fluid in the pump is affected by the adding <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> under the spin <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> when the <b>magnetic</b> fluid is filled in the pump. At the same time, the adding <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is affected by magnetic particles of magnetic fluid. The magnetic fluid can be moved by the effect of the adding <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> in the pump. The flux of magnetic fluid increases with the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field...</b>|$|R
