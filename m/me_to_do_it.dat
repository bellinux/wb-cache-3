She derided her choreography skills, and elaborated: [...] "I was so nervous that day. I had to keep eating bread and toast because my stomach was so sick. But {{it was an interesting}} experience. It was definitely a challenge for me. Of course if they ask <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again, I would do it again. But I’m not going to go begging them for it." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{cast the}} series, Jeremy Simmons and Thairin Smothers posted to LGBT Internet forums and {{electronic}} mailing lists, and visited college campuses. In August 2004 they {{traveled around the}} country to meet the shortlisted candidates. Smothers said that their main casting goal was diversity. Diverse representation was also important to T.J. Jourian, one of the four students cast for the show: [...] "What pushed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> was the idea of showing trans people of color, pushing beyond the American image of a gay white man." [...] "I didn’t want to be in anything where I was representing the whole community.… What I want to do is just give another example of a way to be." ...|$|E
500|$|Williamson's first {{professional}} work {{may have been}} helping Hogarth pencil some Tarzan Sunday pages in 1948, although Williamson, who had initially believed so, reconsidered in a 1983 interview and recalled that his Tarzan work had come after his first two pieces of comic-book art: providing spot illustrations for the story [...] "The World's Ugliest Horse" [...] in Eastern Color's seminal series Famous Funnies #166 (May 1948), and a two-page Boy Scouts story, his first comics narrative, in New Heroic Comics #51 (Nov. 1948). (Williamson is also identified as co-penciler, with Frank Frazetta, of a three-page crime story, [...] "The Last Three Dimes", in Standard Comics' Wonder Comics #20 [...] ) Williamson explained that while Hogarth had offered him Tarzan work, Williamson [...] "just couldn't do it. ... I couldn't get it into my little brain that he wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> exactly {{the way that he}} did it," [...] and instead successfully recommended Celardo, artist of the Tarzan-like feature [...] "Ka'a'nga" [...] in Fiction House's Jungle Comics. As Williamson recalled: ...|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} and mixing of [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] {{took place in}} summer and autumn of 2008. After Rowland heard the instrumental of [...] "When Love Takes Over"—a piano loop-based melody with throbbing percussion—she asked Guetta if she could take the demo and several other tracks to work on. She wrote the lyrics and recorded the vocals in London, within a day. She was aided by Australian songwriters and producers Miriam and Olivia Nervo (The Nervo Twins). However the song remained unfinished until Guetta rediscovered the track while compiling his One Love album. After getting selected for the album, [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] was given to Frédéric Riesterer who, aside from producing the song with Guetta, was tasked the final audio mixing of the song. However Riesterer decided to give the track to French mixing engineer Veronica Ferraro, who would later go {{on to say that}} [...] "Reisterer was supposed to mix it, but he wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> and see how it turned out. The first time I heard the track I immediately knew it would be a huge hit." [...] The track was mixed in September 2008, at Ferraro's Super Sonic Scale studio near Paris, the day after her birthday.|$|E
500|$|DreamWorks {{announced}} Burton's {{appointment in}} August 2006, and Johnny Depp was cast as Todd. Christopher Lee, Peter Bowles, Anthony Head, {{and five other}} actors were set to play the ghost narrators, but their roles were cut (Head does appear in an uncredited cameo as a gentleman who congratulates Depp after the shaving contest). According to Lee, these deletions were due to time constraints caused by a break in filming during March 2007, while Depp's daughter recovered from an illness. Burton's domestic partner Helena Bonham Carter was cast in October 2006, as well as Sacha Baron Cohen. In December 2006, Alan Rickman was cast. In January 2007, Laura Michelle Kelly was cast as Lucy Barker. Timothy Spall {{was added to the}} cast, and said he was urged to audition by his daughter, who wanted him to work with Depp. He recalled, [...] "I really wanted this one – I knew Tim was directing and that Johnny Depp {{was going to be in}} it. My daughter, my youngest daughter, really wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for that reason – Johnny Depp was in it. (She came on set to meet Depp) and he was really delightful to her, she had a great time. Then, I took her to the junket – and (Depp) greeted her like an old pal when he saw her. I've got plenty of brownie points at the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|As an {{openly gay}} man {{throughout}} his career, Sylvester {{came to be}} seen as a spokesman for the gay community. He informed a journalist that [...] "I realize that gay people have put me on a pedestal and I love it. After all, of all the oppressed minorities, they just have to be the most oppressed. They have all the hassles of finding something or someone to identify with [...] and they chose me. I like being around gay people and they've proven to be some of my closest friends and most loyal audiences." [...] Elsewhere, he nevertheless remarked that he felt his career had [...] "transcended the gay movement. I mean, my sexuality has nothing to do with my music. When I'm fucking I'm not thinking about singing and vice versa." [...] He was openly critical of what he perceived as divisive tendencies within the gay community itself, noting that [...] "I get this conformist shit from queens all the time. They always want to read me. They always want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> their way. I am not going to conform to the gay lifestyle as they see it and that's for sure". He was particularly critical of [...] "clones" [...] gay men who dressed alike with boots, boot-cut jeans, checked shirts and handlebar mustaches [...] stating that all too often they judged those gay people who were flamboyant or extravagant.|$|E

"When {{they asked}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> a second time, I said, 'Certainly,' and {{everybody}} thought I {{was out of}} my mind," [...] Burr told Tom Shales of The Washington Post. [...] "But it wasn't the large sum of money. It was the fact that, first of all, I kind of liked 'Godzilla,' and where do you get the opportunity to play yourself 30 years later? So I said yes to both of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|His long-serving deputy at the Treasury, Joel Barnett, in {{response}} to a remark by a third party that [...] "Denis Healey would sell his own grandmother", quipped, [...] "No, he would get <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for him". On 14 June 1978, Healey likened being attacked by the mild-mannered Sir Geoffrey Howe in the House of Commons to being [...] "savaged by a dead sheep". Nevertheless, Howe appeared and paid warm tribute when Healey was featured on This Is Your Life in 1989. The two remained friends for many years, and Howe died only six days after Healey.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1983 season, Boros gained {{note for}} his {{pioneering}} use of [...] "sabermetrics" [...] {{and a computer}} to help guide his managerial decisions. In his book on baseball innovations, historian Peter Morris wrote that Boros was [...] "the first manager to make extensive use of computers in his decision-making process." [...] After every game, Boros had pitch-by-pitch data fed into a mainframe computer at Digital Equipment Corporation in Philadelphia. He would retrieve the data before the next game, analyzing how each pitcher and hitter matched up. Jay Alves, a [...] "sabermetrician" [...] hired by Boros to run the computer system, later recalled: [...] "With Steve, we tracked (on paper) virtually every pitch and where it was hit. Then I'd type it into the computer after the game, but that would {{take a couple of}} hours. That's how long it takes <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with pencil and paper." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gooch's {{commitment}} to England cricket and {{passion for the}} game remains. When commenting on the new England coaching role he said: [...] "It {{came out of the}} blue. I met Andy at Trent Bridge when I was working for radio and I was a bit surprised when he asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> But you spend your career trying to do your bit for England and when you're asked to help again the call of your country is special.". He has since remained as England's batting coach on a permanent basis, continuing this role for the 2010 series against Bangladesh and Pakistan, and the winter Ashes series against Australia in Australia. Double-centurion Alastair Cook (at the first test at the Gabba in Brisbane) hailed Gooch's influence on England's and his own batting prowess. Gooch subsequently has supervised England's batting (or 'run-scoring', as Ian Bell has noted Gooch refers to it) throughout their rise to number 1 in the Test cricket ICC Rankings. Prior to Gooch taking over, English batsmen had scored 6 test double-centuries in 15 years. 15 months after he became the batting coach, England had already beaten that total.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of November 28, 1994, Dahmer left his cell to conduct his {{assigned}} work detail. Accompanying him were two fellow inmates: Jesse Anderson and Christopher Scarver. The trio was left unsupervised in the showers of the prison gym for approximately 20minutes. At approximately 8:10a.m. Dahmer was discovered {{on the floor of}} the bathrooms of the gym suffering from extreme head and facial wounds; he had been severely bludgeoned about the head and face with a 20-inch (51cm) metal bar. His head had also been repeatedly struck against the wall in the assault. Although Dahmer was still alive and was rushed to a nearby hospital, he was pronounced dead one hour later. Anderson had also been beaten with the same instrument, and died two days later from his wounds. Scarver, who was serving a life sentence for a murder committed in 1990, informed authorities he had first attacked Dahmer with the metal bar as he (Dahmer) was cleaning a staff locker room, before attacking Anderson as he (Anderson) cleaned an inmate locker room. According to Scarver, Dahmer did not yell or make any noise as he was attacked. Immediately after attacking both men, Scarver returned to his cell and informed a prison guard: [...] "God told <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Jesse Anderson and Jeffrey Dahmer are dead." [...] Scarver was adamant he had not planned the attacks in advance, although he would later divulge to investigators he had concealed the 20-inch iron bar used to kill both men in his clothing shortly before the killings.|$|E
