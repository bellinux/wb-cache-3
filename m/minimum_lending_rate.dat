40|$|The {{endogenous}} {{theory of}} money, developed by Basil Moore, {{argues that the}} supply of central bank money in modern economies is not {{under the control of}} the central bank. According to this view, a central bank typically supplies cash reserves automatically on demand at its <b>minimum</b> <b>lending</b> <b>rate,</b> resulting in a clearly horizontal money supply function. While the paper agrees with Moore that the supply of central bank money cannot be determined exogenously by the central bank, it wonders whether the supply is determined completely by the demand of the commercial banks. The paper suggests that the central bank has some exogenous power to control the quantity of its supply by rationing. More importantly, the central bank is forced to do so! The central bank cannot not merely exist as an automat responding to the wishes of the commercial banks. Part I discusses the cause why the central bank has to restrict its supply, while part II demonstrates how the supply of central bank money can be controlled by looking at the monetary policy operations of the Eurosystem. In accordance with this analysis, the paper offers a modified horizontal or “staircase ” supply function of central bank money...|$|E
40|$|Any {{world in}} {{transition}} is not short {{of things to}} argue about {{and we are now}} in transition. How our arguments are settled, whatsoever may be the virtue of the settlements, may be important. It has recently been suggested, for example, that 10 British governments have made over thirty fiscal interventions in the conduct of manufacturing industry since the Second World War, in addition to such general economic encouragements as tinkering with the <b>minimum</b> <b>lending</b> <b>rate</b> and the exchange value of the currency. A few of these ups-and-downs are the result of policies argued about during general election campaigns, to be sure, but even they, as well as all the others, are largely based on the advice of experts of one kind or another. But when we ask ourselves from where these experts seek the foundations of their advice, we discover a professional world no less short of its internal dissensions; when successive governments take sides with the different schools of experts, we may expect to find our transitional world also in violent oscillation. Expert controversy then may become mere intellectual brawling; this can be noticed within the professions and even lead to some soul searching [...] . As Johnson observed, after his efforts to secure the reprieve of a well-known preacher had failed: "Depend upon it, Sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in fortnight, it concentrates his attention wonderfully". There is much concentrating of the attention just now. But we need to ask what to concentrate it on; nothing is as bad as the ill-conceived plan efficiently carried out, with its insistence on answering the wrong questions rather than in identifying the right ones. In the regenerative confusion of these iron times, our first need is to recognise the most discriminating questions obscured beneath the distractions of constant change; it is a need no less imperative for a profession like operational research than for the most quick-witted and evasive of party politicians. The doubts thrown on the credentials of our trade by Russell Ackoff's two recent papers are no more than the sentiment of the music hall song: "All dressed up but nowhere to go!" It is, in other words, easy to arm oneself with technique [...] indeed, with an arsenal of different techniques [...] but much more difficult {{to know what to do}} with it. There is no general theory of search, because if you do not know what you are looking for you do not know how to sample your experience. You must therefore start to guess. Decisions about the future, whether or not taken on the advice of experts, call for intelligent conjecture (if they are to be thought out) or just for simple guesswork (if they need not be). But since experts do not like risking their reputations, they are averse to guessing; they prefer to bank on the certainties of the elapsed past rather than to grope blindfold into the future. This paper suggests that action learning may be one means of concentrating attention upon the questions dying to be asked. ...|$|E

40|$|I {{examine the}} effects of {{corruption}} and government control of the banking system for 18 Western hemisphere countries on the sensitivity of commercial <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> to changes in international financial conditions and find that most countries' <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> are insensitive to these conditions. Only the least corrupt nations exhibit a significant positive relation between <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> and international financial conditions. The responsiveness of these <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> is nonlinearly related to corruption and government control of the banking sector. The findings suggest that both corruption and government control of banks need to be considered when analyzing international credit markets. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} bank <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> and their cost of funds in New Zealand. Our results show that on average mortgage rates respond more quickly {{to changes in the}} cost of funds than base business <b>lending</b> <b>rates.</b> We also find an asymmetry in the initial (short-run) response of banks to changes in funding costs; in particular, our results show banks adjust mortgage rates downwards faster than upwards. The speed to which <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> revert back to their equilibrium relationship with funding costs varies across the lending markets. We find the adjustment speed is faster when mortgage rates are below equilibrium, whereas it is slower when business <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> are above long-run levels in relation to funding costs. Our analysis suggests that banks prefer the plain-vanilla type of lending such as mortgages in comparison to small business lending consistent with asymmetric information associated with business loans. <b>Lending</b> <b>rate</b> Cost of funds Small and medium enterprises Information asymmetry Error-correction models...|$|R

Thus, the paper provides further evidence on the relationship between structural financial policies and monetary policy, {{as well as on the}} relevance of credit markets for the monetary policy transmission mechanism.
