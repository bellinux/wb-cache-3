Using a variety of neuroanatomical techniques including anterograde and retrograde tracing, immunocytochemistry and intracellular filling, we have demonstrated convergence of these inputs on to medium-sized spiny neurons. The terminals of the basolateral amygdala projection make asymmetrical synapses predominantly on the heads of spines which also receive on their necks or adjacent dendrites, symmetrical synaptic input from the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> system.

40|$|The {{development}} of successful pharmacotherapeutics {{for the treatment}} of alcoholism is predicated upon understanding the biological action of alcohol. A limitation of the alcohol research field has been examining the effects of alcohol only and ignoring the multiple biological active metabolites of alcohol. The concept that alcohol is a ‘pro-drug’ is not new. Alcohol is readily metabolized to acetaldehyde within the brain. Acetaldehyde is a highly reactive compound that forms a number of condensation products, including salsolinol and iso-salsolinol (acetaldehyde and dopamine). Recent experiments have established that numerous metabolites of ethanol do have direct CNS action, and could, in part or whole, mediate the reinforcing actions of alcohol within the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> system. The <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> system originates in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and projects to forebrain regions that include the nucleus accumbens (Acb) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and is thought to be the neurocircuitry governing the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse. Within this neurocircuitry there is convincing evidence that; 1) biologically active metabolites of alcohol can directly or indirectly increase the activity of VTA dopamine neurons, 2) alcohol and alcohol metabolites are reinforcing within the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> system, 3) inhibiting the alcohol metabolic pathway inhibits the biological consequences of alcohol exposure, 4) alcohol consumption can be reduced by inhibiting/attenuating the alcohol metabolic pathway in the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> system, 5) alcohol metabolites can alter neurochemical levels within the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> system, and 6) alcohol interacts with alcohol metabolites to enhance the actions of both compounds.

Thus the debate continues {{over the role of}} dopamine in reward.

We previously found evidence for a functional interaction between the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> system and circulating vasopressin and the present study was performed to test the hypothesis that <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> stimulation modulates the cardiovascular effects of vasopressin. Sprague-Dawley rats were stereotaxically implanted with a guide cannula into the region of origin of the mesolimbic system, the ventral tegmental area, and instrumented with catheters into the abdominal aorta and jugular vein. One week later, separate groups of conscious rats were injected intravenously with 1, 3 or 10 [*]ng[*]kg− 1 of arginine-vasopressin or other vasopressor drugs before and after intra-ventral tegmental area injection of 10 [*]nmol of neurotensin. Intra-ventral tegmental area injections of neurotensin had no significant effect on mean arterial pressure and heart rate but significantly potentiated the pressor response to intravenous administration of vasopressin when compared to saline-injections. However, the vasopressin-induced bradycardia was unaffected. Intravenous pretreatment with raclopride blocked the ability of neurotensin, injected into the ventral tegmental area, to potentiate the vasopressin-induced pressor response. Intra ventral tegmental area injections of neurotensin had no effect on the pressor response and bradycardia induced by intravenous angiotensin II or methoxamine. In conclusion, these results suggest that the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> system, in addition to its well-known role in the regulation of behaviour, modulates cardiovascular control by potentiating the effects of vasopressin on mean arterial pressure...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to clarify whether tobacco smoke inhalation would affect dopaminergic projections differently from the reported activation after the systemic administration of nicotine. For this purpose, tobacco smoke from cigarettes containing 1. 0 or 0. 1 mg nicotine was delivered by inhalation to rats, while recording from antidromically identified nigrostriatal and <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> neurons. Smoke inhalation from 1. 0 mg nicotine cigarettes caused a peculiar abrupt increase: of discharge activity of <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> neurons while nigrostriatal cells were less responsive. This activation was promptly antagonized by mecamylamine (2. 0 mg/kg, i. v.). In contrast, smoke delivered from 0. 1 mg nicotine cigarettes was ineffective. These findings suggest that the boosting activation of <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> neurons by inhaled nicotine might be relevant for the rewarding properties Of tobacco smoking and also for the effectiveness of new treatments to stop smoking.

5000|$|The mesolimbic pathway is {{activated}} trans-synaptically by normal rewards (food, water, copulation) {{but it can}} also be activated directly by the induced rewards of intravenous drugs or electrical or chemical brain stimulation. The mesolimbic pathway is one of the dopaminergic pathways in the brain that modulates behavioral responses to rewarding stimuli. It originates in the VTA and connects to the limbic system via the nucleus accumbens, the amygdala, and the medial prefrontal cortex.

50|$|The lateral {{hypothalamus}} and medial forebrain bundle {{has been}} the most-frequently-studied brain-stimulation reward site, particularly in studies {{of the effects of}} drugs on brain stimulation reward. The neurotransmitter system that has been most-clearly identified with the habit-forming actions of drugs-of-abuse is the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> system, with its efferent targets in the nucleus accumbens and its local GABAergic afferents. The reward-relevant actions of amphetamine and cocaine are in the dopaminergic synapses of the nucleus accumbens and perhaps the medial prefrontal cortex. Rats also learn to lever-press for cocaine injections into the medial prefrontal cortex, which works by increasing dopamine turnover in the nucleus accumbens. Nicotine infused directly into the nucleus accumbens also enhances local dopamine release, presumably by a presynaptic action on the dopaminergic terminals of this region. Nicotinic receptors localize to dopaminergic cell bodies and local nicotine injections increase dopaminergic cell firing that is critical for nicotinic reward. Some additional habit-forming drugs are also likely to decrease the output of medium spiny neurons as a consequence, despite activating dopaminergic projections. For opiates, the lowest-threshold site for reward effects involves actions on GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, a secondary site of opiate-rewarding actions on medium spiny output neurons of the nucleus accumbens. Thus GABAergic afferents to the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> neurons (primary substrate of opiate reward), the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> neurons themselves (primary substrate of psychomotor stimulant reward), and GABAergic efferents to the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> neurons (a secondary site of opiate reward) form the core of currently characterized drug-reward circuitry.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanisms}} underlying ethanol-induced {{activation of}} the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> system are not fully understood, but increased extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (nAc) {{has been shown to}} involve nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Basal activity of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is under the influence of GABAergic neurotransmission, and the aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the involvement of nAChRs in mediating acute ethanol effects on GABAergic activity in subregions of the brain reward system. Multi-electrode in vivo recordings were made in the VTA and nAc of awake and behaving C 57 BL 6 /J mice receiving intraperitoneal injections of saline or ethanol (2. 0  g/kg), combined with, or without, pre-injection of the non-competitive nAChR antagonist mecamylamine (1. 0  mg/kg). Ethanol significantly decreased the activity of quinpirole-insensitive slow-spiking and fast-spiking units in both the VTA and the nAc as compared to saline injection. Pre-treatment with mecamylamine inhibited the rate-inhibiting properties of ethanol in the VTA, but not in the nAc. The data presented here show that ethanol depresses the activity of quinpirole-insensitive, putative GABAergic neurons, in the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> system of mice, and that nAChRs contribute to this modulation. This finding, taken together with previous microdialysis studies, supports an involvement of GABAergic neurons and nAChRs in ethanol's interaction with the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> system...|$|R
40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} peptide glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP- 1) {{is known}} to regulate consummatory behavior and is released in response to nutrient ingestion. Analogues of this peptide recently emerged as novel pharmacotherapies for treatment of type II diabetes since they reduce gastric emptying, glucagon secretion as well as enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion. The findings that GLP- 1 targets reward related areas including <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> areas indicate that the physiological role of GLP- 1 extends beyond food intake and glucose homeostasis control to include reward regulation. The present series of experiments was therefore designed to investigate {{the effects of the}} GLP- 1 receptor agonist, Exendin- 4 (Ex 4), on established nicotine-induced effects on the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> system in mice. Specifically, we show that treatment with Ex 4, at a dose with no effect per se, attenuate nicotine-induced locomotor stimulation, accumbal dopamine release as well as the expression of conditioned place preference in mice. In accordance, Ex 4 also blocks nicotine-induced expression of locomotor sensitization in mice.

40|$|Conventionally, cocaine {{is thought}} to exert its {{rewarding}} and reinforcing effects on the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> pathway, which is {{commonly referred to as}} the reward circuitry of the brain. Cocaine increases dopamine levels within the NAc by blocking dopamine reuptake by antagonizing dopamine transporters (DATs) on the VTA dopaminergic axon terminals. Traditionally, it is believed that with repeated cocaine use, this neuronal action causes neuroadaptations that underlie addiction. However, developments within the last two decades indicate that glial cells within the central nervous system’s immune system act as non-neuronal modulators of drug reward. It was recently found that cocaine interacts with the TLR 4 /MD- 2 complex to produce a proinflammatory response, and that this interaction is necessary for cocaine reward. The present investigation proceeds to demonstrate that cocaine can directly activate microglia cells through TLR 4, causing them to upregulate mRNA of the proinflammatory cytokine, IL- 1 β, within the VTA. Furthermore, cocaine-induced dopamine increases in the NAc depend on cocaine-induced IL- 1 β signaling within the VTA. TLR 4 and IL- 1 β are also important aspects underlying cocaine-primed reinstatement to drug seeking in a self-administration paradigm. In this self-administration model, repeated exposure to cocaine appeared to induce glial priming, and led to the expression of additional proinflammatory markers throughout the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> pathway, providing new targets for further investigation into cocaine reinforcement. The investigation was expanded to include another commonly abused psychostimulant, methamphetamine (meth), which has also been recently shown to interact with the TLR 4 /MD- 2 complex. Here, it is shown that the meth-induced neuroinflammation revealed within the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> pathway is TLR 4 dependent; however, unlike cocaine, meth reward and reinforcement may be driven by mechanisms other than IL- 1 β signaling. Comparisons between cocaine-induced and meth-induced neuroinflammation suggest that IL- 6 may also be an important molecule in mediating <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> pathway functionality. The present studies provide evidence that the rewarding and reinforcing effects of psychostimulants arise from synergistic mechanisms involving both direct neuronal actions and neuroimmune interactions...|$|R

40|$|The {{ventral tegmental area}} {{contains}} a high density of dopaminergic perikaryon which present ascending axonal projections notably to the nucleus accumbens. This system, referred as the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> system has been demonstrated to display moderate to high density of enkephalin-containing fibers. This topographical analogy led us to evaluate the properties of kelatorphan, a new potent inhibitor of multiple enkephalin-degrading enzymes, on this mesolimbic system. Intracranial self-stimulation behavior served to estimate this mesolimbic dopaminergic function. Kelatorphan was injected either into the lateral ventricle or into the nucleus accumbens. Kelatorphan elicited opposite behavioral profiles, i. e. an intracranial self-stimulation increase when intracerebroventricularly injected (70 nmol) and a decreased self-stimulation behavior when directly administered into the nucleus accumbens (35 nmol). The results thus suggest that kelatorphan which protects endogenous enkephalins against enzymatic degradation seemed {{to act on the}} regulation of the <b>mesolimbic</b> <b>dopamine</b> system. © 1988.

40|$|Reward cues {{have been}} found to {{increase}} the investment of effort in tasks even when cues are presented suboptimally (i. e. very briefly), making them hard to consciously detect.

To provide further support for this assumption, we performed two studies investigating whether these effort responses vary with individual differences in markers of striatal dopaminergic functioning. Study 1 investigated the relation between physical effort responses and resting state eye-blink rate. Study 2 examined cognitive effort responses in relation to individually averaged error-related negativity. In both studies effort responses correlated with the markers only for suboptimal, but not for optimal reward cues.
