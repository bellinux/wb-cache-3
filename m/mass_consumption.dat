5|$|By the 1960s, the bikini {{swimsuit}} influenced panty {{styles and}} {{coincided with the}} cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants. In the seventies, {{with the emergence of}} skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline {{and the rise of the}} leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure. From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein, particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for <b>mass</b> <b>consumption,</b> and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness. Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech skin-tight garments, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Heinze's first book, Adapting to Abundance: Jewish Immigrants, <b>Mass</b> <b>Consumption,</b> and the Search for American Identity, was {{published}} in 1990. It was the first full-length study {{of the impact of}} American consumer culture on an immigrant group. Hasia Diner, Professor of History at New York University, said about Heinze: “Historians of immigration and Jewish history will be indebted to him for opening up whole areas of behavior which they previously shrugged off as irrelevant.” The Journal of Consumer Affairs remarked upon the variety of topics that the book explored: the rise of ad campaigns for major American products in the foreign-language press; the rise of the summer vacation among working people; installment-buying as a way for working families to obtain expensive furnishings such as pianos; the role of Jewish women as agents of assimilation through their control over family purchases; and the way that American abundance altered religious rituals, especially holidays such as Chanukah and Passover. Adapting to Abundance established Heinze's reputation as part of a scholarly vanguard that produced the first histories of <b>mass</b> <b>consumption</b> in Europe and America. It is widely referenced in books, articles and syllabi around the world.|$|E

One of the alternatives is using waste as feed that will be converted into chemical compound and fuel. Solid waste from pulp and paper manufacturing that contains lignocellulose which is a biomass has potency to be processed for chemical compounds, such as sugar solution (D-glucose), Furfural, and Acetone-Buthanol-Ethanol (ABE).

25|$|About {{five years}} after the disco era came to a close in the late 1970s, rave culture began to emerge from the acid house scene. Rave culture {{incorporated}} disco culture's same love of dance music played by DJs over powerful sound systems, recreational drug and club drug exploration, sexual promiscuity, and hedonism. Although disco culture started out underground, it eventually thrived in the mainstream by the late 1970s, and major labels commodified and packaged the music for <b>mass</b> <b>consumption.</b> In contrast, the rave culture started out underground and stayed underground. In part this was to avoid the animosity that was still surrounding disco and dance music. The rave scene also stayed underground to avoid law enforcement attention that was directed at the rave culture due to its use of secret, unauthorized warehouses for some dance events and its association with illegal club drugs like Ecstasy.|$|E

This is contrary to the clear requirement for decreased complexity, <b>mass,</b> and power <b>consumption</b> to fit the needs of small, maneuverable, low-cost spacecraft. To address this need, AeroAstro and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Space Systems Laboratory are developing a coarse star tracker, which strikes an appropriate balance between accuracy, power <b>consumption,</b> <b>mass</b> and cost. The coarse star tracker is targeted for small spacecraft, addressing requirements {{of a wide range of}} applications, including orbit transfer and rendezvous missions. This market is presently inadequately served, because higher accuracy star trackers simply do not fit within the mass, power, and cost constraints of small spacecraft missions. The design described herein is a 300 -gram unit that consumes less than 1 Watt of power. With a pointing accuracy of better than 100 arc-seconds, the star tracker will enable a cost-effective three-axis stabilized spacecraft to attain pointing accuracies to better than 0. 25 degree, more than adequate for most low-earth orbit (LEO) missions.
