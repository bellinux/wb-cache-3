500|$|In an {{interview}} with Locus, Clarke explains why and how she integrated the theme of [...] "Englishness" [...] into Jonathan Strange: [...] "I wanted to explore <b>my</b> <b>ideas</b> of the fantastic, as well as <b>my</b> <b>ideas</b> of England and my attachment to English landscape....Sometimes it feels to me as though we don't have a fable of England, of Britain, something strong and idealized and romantic. I was picking up on things like Chesterton and Conan Doyle, and the sense (which is also in Jane Austen) {{of what it was}} to be an English gentleman at the time when England was a very confident place". In particular, [...] "it's the sort of Englishness which is stuffy but fundamentally benevolent, and fundamentally very responsible {{about the rest of the}} world", which connects Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes to Clarke's Jonathan Strange.|$|E
500|$|Was it his ambitious poetry, {{which was}} written to win you, that stopped my ability to think? Did it cause all of <b>my</b> <b>ideas</b> to die {{as soon as they}} were born? Was it his heaven given ability, writing [...] which was blessed by the gods, that stopped me in my tracks? Neither he nor his companions who helped him were able to stop my poetic ability. Neither he nor the Muse which aids him each night can claim to have silenced me. For I am not afraid. However, when your beauty was gifted to him then I was lost and destroyed.|$|E

6000|$|Distinctly, he was uneasy--though as yet perhaps but vaguely--at what I {{might be}} coming to.

500|$|Except {{for when}} Hagström needs a soloist, he and Thordendal rarely record together. Both play guitar and bass while composing. Haake says about his songwriting, [...] "Sometimes I'll sample guitar parts, cut them up, pitch-shift and tweak them until I've built the riffs I want, just for demoing purposes. But {{most of the}} time I'll just present the drums, and explain <b>my</b> <b>ideas</b> {{for the rest of the}} song, sing some riffs." [...] The band uses Cubase to record the tracks, and the guitars are routed through {{software}} amplifier modeling, because it allows them to change the amp settings even after the song was fully recorded.|$|E
500|$|Emma Thomas has co-produced all of {{his films}} (including Memento, in which she is {{credited}} as an associate producer). He regularly works with his brother, Jonathan Nolan (creator of Person of Interest and Westworld), who describes their working relationship in the production notes for The Prestige: [...] "I've always suspected that {{it has something to}} do with the fact that he's left-handed and I'm right-handed, because he's somehow able to look at <b>my</b> <b>ideas</b> and flip them around in a way that's just a little bit more twisted and interesting. It's great to be able to work with him like that". When working on separate projects the brothers always consult each other.|$|E
500|$|As for the criticisms, she said, [...] "I am who I am and I will {{continue}} to be." [...] She portrayed some of her views on her life in a 1968 interview aboard a campaign plane with Gloria Steinem: [...] "Now, I have friends in all {{the countries of the}} world. I haven’t just sat back and thought of myself or <b>my</b> <b>ideas</b> or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don’t have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I’ve never had it easy. I’m not like all you ... all those people who had it easy." ...|$|E

500|$|Crane's poems, {{which he}} {{preferred}} to call [...] "lines", are typically not given as much scholarly attention as his fiction; no anthology contained Crane's verse until 1926. [...] Although it is not certain when Crane began to write poetry seriously, he once said that his overall poetic aim was [...] "to give <b>my</b> <b>ideas</b> {{of life as a}} whole, so far as I know it". [...] The poetic style used in both of his books of poetry, The Black Riders and Other Lines and War is Kind, was unconventional for the time in that it was written in free verse without rhyme, meter, or even titles for individual works. [...] They are typically short in length; although several poems, such as [...] "Do not weep, maiden, for war is kind", use stanzas and refrains, most do not. [...] Crane also differed from his peers and poets of later generations in that his work contains allegory, dialectic and narrative situations.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Smith {{released}} his debut album, Boomin' Words from Hell, in 1989. Of the album, Smith stated, [...] "It was the crack era, [...] and that's where all that really came from. It was all an expression about [...] Young Boys Incorporated, Mayor Coleman Young, the city we lived in and just the turmoil that our city was going through at the time. We referred {{to the streets of}} Detroit as 'Hell' on that record. So that's where <b>my</b> <b>ideas</b> came from." [...] In 1990, Esham and James H. Smith founded the independent record label Reel Life Productions, which reissued his debut album with an alternate track listing and artwork. Esham found it difficult to develop a fanbase, because many wrote off the dark content of his lyrics and imagery as shock value, while hip hop fans did not connect to Esham's albums because of his heavy metal influences.|$|E

500|$|Santiago and Thompson {{shared a}} room {{at the start of the}} second semester. Santiago soon {{introduced}} his new roommate to 1970s punk and the music of David Bowie. He later recalled their time together in college: [...] "Charles and I had a suite at the college dorm. We'd go to shows, I remember seeing Black Flag and Angst. Initially, I think we just liked each other. I did notice right away that he was playing music... He'd write 'em , and I'd throw <b>my</b> <b>ideas</b> on the guitar." [...] In their second year of college, Thompson traveled to Puerto Rico as an exchange student. After six months there living with a [...] "weird, psycho roommate," [...] Thompson sent Santiago a letter with the words [...] "We gotta do it, now is the time, Joe, we gotta chase our dreams"; Santiago replied, saying [...] "Yes, now's the time." [...] Upon receiving this reply, Thompson decided to return to Amherst to start a rock band with Santiago.|$|E
500|$|While {{recording}} for her thirteenth studio album, Madonna enlisted American DJ {{and producer}} Diplo {{to work with}} her on some songs. In May 2014, she posted three photos on her Instagram account, which revealed she was working the producer. She called him [...] "a slave driver" [...] in the studio. Diplo commented that he met Madonna because of her kids and then she invited him to a party, and they ended up writing seven songs together. He continued: [...] "I do not usually feel pressured to write hits, but when it’s an artist of this cailber, it’s obvious that I want to push the bounderies a little bit further and surpass myself."

500|$|During {{his tenure}} at UC Davis, he trained more than 30 {{graduate}} students in genetics, developmental biology and agricultural science. In 1973, Stebbins gave his last lectures at UC Davis and was made professor emeritus. Following his retirement, he travelled widely, taught, and visited colleagues for the next 20 years. His last paper, [...] "A brief summary of <b>my</b> <b>ideas</b> on evolution", {{was published in the}} American Journal of Botany in 1999. [...] The same year he was co-recipient with Ernst Mayr of the Distinguished Service award from the American Institute of Biological Sciences. A colloquium was held by the National Academies of Science in 2000 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the publication of Variation and Evolution in Plants. Stebbins died in his home in Davis the same year from a cancer-related illness. Stebbins was honored at a Unitarian memorial servicehe had been active in the church in his later years following his 1958 marriage to his second wife, Barbara Monaghan Stebbins. His ashes were scattered at Stebbins Cold Canyon Reserve.|$|E

500|$|Many {{commentators}} {{have noted the}} disjunction between the experimental works before the 1936 denunciation and the more conservative ones that followed; the composer told Flora Litvinova, [...] "without 'Party guidance'... I would have displayed more brilliance, used more sarcasm, I could have revealed <b>my</b> <b>ideas</b> openly {{instead of having to}} resort to camouflage." [...] Articles published by Shostakovich in 1934 and 1935 cited Berg, Schoenberg, Krenek, Hindemith, [...] "and especially Stravinsky" [...] among his influences. Key works of the earlier period are the First Symphony, which combined the academicism of the conservatory with his progressive inclinations; The Nose ("The most uncompromisingly modernist of all his stage-works"); Lady Macbeth. which precipitated the denunciation; and the Fourth Symphony, described in Grove's Dictionary as [...] "a colossal synthesis of Shostakovich's musical development to date". The Fourth Symphony was also the first in which the influence of Mahler came to the fore, prefiguring the route Shostakovich was to take to secure his rehabilitation, while he himself admitted that the preceding two were his least successful.|$|E
500|$|Pound came {{to believe}} that the cause of World War I was finance capitalism, which he called [...] "usury", that the {{solution}} lay in C.H. Douglas's idea of social credit, and that fascism was the vehicle for reform. He had met Douglas in the New Age offices and had been impressed by his ideas. He gave a series of lectures on economics, and made contact with politicians in the United States to discuss education, interstate commerce and international affairs. Although Hemingway advised against it, on 30 January 1933 Pound met Benito Mussolini. Olga Rudge played for Mussolini and told him about Pound, who had earlier sent him a copy of Cantos XXX. During the meeting Pound tried to present Mussolini with a digest of his economic ideas, but Mussolini brushed them aside, though he called the Cantos [...] "divertente" [...] (entertaining). The meeting was recorded in Canto XLI: [...] "'Ma questo' / [...] said the boss, 'è divertente.'" [...] Pound said he had [...] "never met anyone who seemed to get <b>my</b> <b>ideas</b> so quickly as the boss".|$|E
500|$|In February 2014, Madonna {{announced}} that she had begun working on her thirteenth studio album, saying [...] "I'm {{right now in the}} process of talking to various co-writers and producers and talking about where I want to go with my music".

Two months later, Madonna posted a selfie where she talked about working with American DJ Diplo. Madonna had invited him to her annual Oscar party, but he was unable to attend. They eventually started talking about music through texts and decided to collaborate on the album.

500|$|Early in 1848, Smetana {{wrote to}} Franz Liszt, {{whom he had}} not yet met, asking him to accept the {{dedication}} of a new piano work, Six Characteristic Pieces, and recommend it to a publisher. He also requested a loan of 400gulden, to enable him to open a music school. Liszt replied cordially, accepting the dedication and promising to help find a publisher, but he offered no financial assistance. This encouragement {{was the beginning of a}} friendship that was of great value to Smetana in his subsequent career. Despite Liszt's lack of financial support, Smetana was able to start a Piano Institute in late August 1848, with twelve students. After a period of struggle the Institute began to flourish and became briefly fashionable, particularly among supporters of Czech nationalism in whose eyes Smetana was developing a reputation. Proksch wrote of Smetana's support for his people's cause, and said that he [...] "could well become the transformer of <b>my</b> <b>ideas</b> in the Czech language." [...] In 1849 the Institute was relocated to the home of Kateřina's parents, and began to attract distinguished visitors; Liszt came regularly, and the former Austrian emperor Ferdinand, who had settled in Prague, attended the school's matinée concerts. Smetana's performances in these concerts became a recognised feature of Prague's musical life. In this time of relative financial stability Smetana married Kateřina, on 27August 1849. Four daughters were born to the couple between 1851 and 1855.|$|E
500|$|... "Living for Love" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Madonna, Diplo and Ariel Rechtshaid, with additional writing from MoZella and Toby Gad.

She had invited him for her annual Oscar party, {{and he could not}} make it. So he began texting with her about music and sent some music. Madonna replied with a 20-page text containing her anecdotes on the music. Following this they started collaborating for the album.

500|$|American singer Gloria Estefan, {{whose husband}} Emilio Estefan was {{managing}} Shakira at that time, felt that Shakira {{had the potential}} to crossover into the mainstream pop industry. However, Shakira was initially hesitant to record songs in English as it was not her first language, so Estefan offered to translate [...] "Ojos Así" [...] into English in order to show her that [...] "it could translate well." [...] Shakira then began translating the song herself and showed it to Estefan, who responded [...] "Quite honestly, I can't do this better!." [...] As Shakira wanted to have full control over her recordings, she decided to learn English better to enable her to write her own songs. Wanting to [...] "find a way to express <b>my</b> <b>ideas</b> and my feelings, my day-to-day stories in English", Shakira bought rhyming dictionaries, started analysing the lyrics of songs by Bob Dylan, reading poetry and the work of authors like Leonard Cohen and Walt Whitman and took English lessons from a private tutor. [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] became the first song Shakira wrote in English and in an interview with Faze, she talked about the writing process of the song, saying [...] "I prayed and asked God to send me a good song today, and I remember I started writing the song [...] a couple of hours after. I wrote the music and lyrics at the same time, and when that happens it's really magical to me."
