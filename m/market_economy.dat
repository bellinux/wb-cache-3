5|$|Globalization at {{this time}} was {{hindered}} by war, diseases and population growth in certain areas. The Corn Laws were established to regulate imports and exports of grains in England, thus restricting trade {{and the expansion of}} globalization. The Corn Crop Laws hindered the <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> and globalization based on tariffs and import restrictions. Eventually, the Ricardian theory of economics became prominent and allowed for improved trade regulations, specifically with Portugal.|$|E

5|$|Marketplaces are {{difficult}} to identify archaeologically. However, the Spanish reported a thriving <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> when they arrived in the region. At some Classic period cities, archaeologists have tentatively identified formal arcade-style masonry architecture and parallel alignments of scattered stones as the permanent foundations of market stalls. A 2007 study analysed soils from a modern Guatemalan market and compared the results with those obtained from analysis at a proposed ancient market at Chunchucmil. Unusually high levels of zinc and phosphorus at both sites indicated similar food production and vegetable sales activity. The calculated density of market stalls at Chunchucmil strongly suggests that a thriving <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> already existed in the Early Classic. Archaeologists have tentatively identified marketplaces at {{an increasing number of}} Maya cities by means of a combination of archaeology and soil analysis. When the Spanish arrived, Postclassic cities in the highlands had markets in permanent plazas, with officials on hand to settle disputes, enforce rules, and collect taxes.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} development in India followed socialist-inspired politicians {{for most of its}} independent history, including state-ownership of many sectors; India's per capita income increased at only around 1% annualised rate in the three decades after its independence. Since the mid-1980s, India has slowly opened up its markets through economic liberalisation. After more fundamental reforms since 1991 and their renewal in the 2000s, India has progressed towards a free <b>market</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{failure of}} {{uncovered}} interest rate parity (UIP) {{is a well-known}} phenomenon of the last thirty years. UIP failure is more prominent in advanced economies than in emerging <b>market</b> <b>economies.</b> Typically, UIP estimation for an advanced economy generates a negative coefficient, meaning that a higher interest rate in advanced economy A {{will result in the}} appreciation of economy A's exchange rate. For emerging <b>market</b> <b>economies,</b> higher interest rates usually correspond to future depreciation, although this depreciation is not sufficient for UIP to hold. This paper shows that UIP holds in Russia better than in other emerging <b>market</b> <b>economies</b> when the UIP equation accounts for a constant risk premium. Consequently, there is no forward premium puzzle for Russian data for 2001 – 2014. To determine the results for Russia and to compare them with the results for other countries, we estimate UIP first for Russia and then for advanced and emerging <b>market</b> <b>economies</b> using seemingly unrelated regressions and panel data analysis. By comparing the profitability of static and dynamic carry trade strategies, we also confirm that in emerging <b>market</b> <b>economies,</b> risk premiums are often constant, whereas in advanced economies, risk premiums are almost always volatile. This may explain why UIP holds better in emerging <b>market</b> <b>economies.</b> It also enables us to formulate a hypothesis that macroeconomic policies of emerging <b>market</b> <b>economies</b> (e. g., the accumulation of large foreign exchange reserves) stabilize risk premiums...|$|R

5|$|The {{congress}} is noteworthy {{because of the}} extent of democratization which took place within the party.

5|$|Malaysia is a {{relatively}} open state-oriented and newly industrialised <b>market</b> <b>economy.</b> The state plays a significant but declining role in guiding economic activity through macroeconomic plans. Malaysia has {{had one of the}} best economic records in Asia, with GDP growing an average 6.5 per cent annually from 1957 to 2005. Malaysia's economy in 2014–2015 {{was one of the most}} competitive in Asia, ranking 6th in Asia and 20th in the world, higher than countries like Australia, France and South Korea. In 2014, Malaysia's economy grew 6%, the second highest growth in ASEAN behind the Philippines' growth of 6.1%. The economy of Malaysia in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) at purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2014 was $746.821billion, the third largest in ASEAN behind more populous Indonesia and Thailand and the 28th largest in the world.|$|E
5|$|Modern Japan's {{economic}} growth {{began in the}} Edo period. Some of the surviving elements of the Edo period are roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers. During the Meiji period from 1868, Japan expanded economically with the embrace of the <b>market</b> <b>economy.</b> Many of today's enterprises were founded at the time, and Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia. The period of overall real {{economic growth}} from the 1960s to the 1980s {{has been called the}} Japanese post-war economic miracle: it averaged 7.5 percent in the 1960s and 1970s, and 3.2 percent in the 1980s and early 1990s.|$|E
40|$|The {{paper by}} Arminio Fraga, Ilan Goldfajn and Andre Minella is a {{thoughtful}} and very important paper on inflation targeting in emerging <b>market</b> <b>economies.</b> Not {{only does it}} add substantially to the literature on how to conduct monetary policy in these economies, but as I will argue below, it has important lessons for monetary policy in advanced economies. Because I have so little to be critical about, my comments will focus on expanding some themes that {{are discussed in the}} paper. Specifically, I will first examine why emerging <b>market</b> <b>economies</b> are so different from advanced economies and why this affects thinking about monetary policy. Then I will address several issues for inflation targeting in emerging <b>market</b> <b>economies</b> discussed in the paper: target bands, transparency and formality, response to shocks and IMF conditionality.

Curtis was the original author of the 1898 Curtis Act, which dissolved the tribal governments of the five civilized tribes, including the Cherokee, and promoted the allotment of formerly communal tribal lands to individuals, {{with a view to}} encouraging the assimilation of Indians into mainstream US society and the <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> (though the bill was heavily amended in committee, to the point where Curtis himself had reservations about the legislation in its final form).

5|$|Ryzhkov's Plan and The 500 Days Programme were broadly similar, {{with both}} {{supporting}} price liberalisation, decentralisation and privatisation. The main {{difference between the}} two was Ryzhkov's desire to retain much of the social security system, free education for all and the continuance of a strong central government apparatus. The 500 Days Programme did not mention political union with the other Soviet republics, but instead weakened the authority of the central government by establishing a <b>market</b> <b>economy.</b> In other words, they left the question of continuing or dissolving the Soviet Union open. On 17 September in a meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev openly supported the 500 Days Programme, claiming it would not lead to the reestablishment of capitalism, but instead to a mixed economy where private enterprise played an important role.|$|E
5|$|The Comanches {{operated}} as {{an autonomous}} power inside the area claimed by Spain but not controlled by it. The Comanches used their military power to obtain supplies and labor from the Mexicans, and Indians through thievery, tribute, and kidnappings, and the Spanish could {{do little to}} stop them because the Comanches controlled most of the horses {{in the region and}} thus had more wealth and mobility. Although powered by violence, the Comanche empire was primarily an economic construction, rooted in an extensive commercial network that facilitated long-distance trade. Dealing with subordinate Indians, the Comanche spread their language and culture across the region. In terms of governance, the Comanches created a centralized political system, based on a foraging <b>market</b> <b>economy,</b> and a hierarchical social organization.|$|E

Of particular practical importance was Mikołajczyk's People's Party, because it was legally recognized by the communists and thus able to function within the political arena. The People's Party wanted to prevent the communists from monopolizing power and eventually establish a parliamentary polity with a <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> by winning the promised elections.

5|$|The delegates {{approved}} the general secretary's Political Report, Report on Orientations and Tasks for Socio-Economic Development for the 2006–10 Period, and the Report on Party building and amendments {{made to the}} party statute. These reports' main objectives were to accelerate the reform process and strengthen the socialist-oriented <b>market</b> <b>economy.</b> The congress allowed existing party members to engage in private ownership. This was a controversial amendment and was a break with the theory of exploitation of man by man. While the amendment was approved, the third plenum of the 10th Central Committee restricted the change to party members who had worked in state-owned enterprises which have been privatized.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} England in the Middle Ages, from the Norman {{invasion}} in 1066, {{to the death}} of HenryVII in 1509, was fundamentally agricultural, though even before the invasion the <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> was important to producers. Norman institutions, including serfdom, were superimposed on an existing system of open fields and mature, well-established towns involved in international trade. Over the next five centuries the economy would at first grow and then suffer an acute crisis, resulting in significant political and economic change. Despite economic dislocation in urban and extraction economies, including shifts in the holders of wealth and the location of these economies, the economic output of towns and mines developed and intensified over the period. By the end of the period, England had a weak government, by later standards, overseeing an economy dominated by rented farms controlled by gentry, and a thriving community of indigenous English merchants and corporations.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally a pro-market {{economy and}} pro-EU centre-right party, the NCP were the largest {{party in the}} {{parliament}} {{for the first time}} in its history, though losing seats since the 2007 election. Although leading in the opinion polls for several years, it started to see some loss of support after the rise of the True Finns. Despite being founded as a primarily conservative party, an analysis on the party's programmes made by an NCP-affiliated think tank concluded that in the 2000s the liberal wing had gained the upper hand and had started to change the party's political ideology. At the party conference in 2010, the NCP delegates voted in favour of legalising same-sex marriage. The party's supporters are also generally very supportive of <b>market</b> <b>economy,</b> nuclear power and Finland's admission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.|$|E
5|$|Following {{research}} of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists {{have reached a}} consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization. Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy fiscal policy, robust bank regulations, and strong legal protection of property rights. Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment, liberalizing domestic equity capital, and embracing capital outflows and short-term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework. An emerging <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> must develop a credible currency {{in the eyes of}} both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at higher interest rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a credible currency, it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights and sudden stops, which carry serious economic and social costs.|$|E
5|$|In December 2000, the IMF stopped aid {{disbursements}} due {{to corruption}} concerns, and many individual donors followed suit, {{resulting in an}} almost 80% drop in Malawi's development budget.

40|$|Extract] In {{developed}} <b>market</b> <b>economies</b> pediculosis causes angst {{which is}} far {{out of proportion to}} its clinical significance. Control has used a biomedical approach, based on the biology of head lice, dispelling myths with evidence and unifying recommendations. Topical insecticides have been the major intervention until the last decade when use of hair conditioner and physical removal of lice using fine tooth combs has been promoted. However, the anxiety provoked by head lice in developed <b>market</b> <b>economies</b> has not been addressed in a systematic way at the population level. Since the socio-emotional area is arguably the major impact of pediculosis in developed <b>market</b> <b>economies,</b> failure to deal with this aspect is a major deficiency in control strategies. The most prominent differences between head lice control in developing countries and developed <b>market</b> <b>economies</b> are that in the former emotional reactions to head lice are far less important...|$|R
