500|$|Smart {{also said}} of the opening scene that: [...] "It encapsulates that {{character}} in one moment and says so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> impulsiveness.

500|$|... he lyric is very <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>her.</b> She {{talks about}} being {{surrounded}} by friends but she's alone: 'How can the silence seem so loud?' and then 'There's only us when the lights go down'. I think that's probably the most personal line on the whole album about her and Jay, because they are very real, and they're very much in love, {{and it must be}} pretty tough to have that love when you're incredibly famous.|$|E

Richard Polwhele targeted her in particular in his anonymous long poem The Unsex'd Females (1798), a defensive reaction to women's literary self-assertion: Hannah More is Christ to Wollstonecraft's Satan. His poem was [...] "well known" [...] among the responses A Vindication. One reviewer comments this [...] "ingenious poem" [...] with its [...] "playful sallies of sarcastic wit" [...] against [...] "our modern ladies," [...] though others found it [...] "a tedious, lifeless piece of writing." [...] Critical responses largely fell along clear-cut political lines.|$|E
