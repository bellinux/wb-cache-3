5|$|In 1964 Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson serendipitously {{discovered}} the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal in the <b>microwave</b> <b>band.</b> Their discovery provided substantial {{confirmation of the}} big-bang predictions by Alpher, Herman and Gamow around 1950. Through the 1970s the radiation {{was found to be}} approximately consistent with a black body spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1978.|$|E
25|$|Dust {{is widely}} {{present in the}} galaxy.

25|$|Early {{conventional}} tube {{systems were}} limited to the high frequency bands, and although very high frequency systems became widely available in the late 1930s, the ultra high frequency and microwave regions were well beyond the ability of conventional circuits.

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{satellite}} communication for global coverage has apparently indicated {{a renewed interest}} in the studies of radio wave propagation through the atmosphere, in the VHF, UHF and <b>microwave</b> <b>bands.</b> The extensive measurements of atmosphere constituents, dynamics and radio meterological parameters during the Middle Atmosphere Program (MAP) have opened up further the possibilities of studying tropospheric radio wave propagation parameters, relevant to Earth/space link design. The three basic parameters of significance to radio propagation are thermal emission, absorption and group delay of the atmosphere, all of which are controlled largely by the water vapor content in the atmosphere, particular at <b>microwave</b> <b>bands.</b> As good emitters are also good absorbers, the atmospheric emission as well as the absorption attains a maximum at the frequency of 22. 235 GHz, which is the peak of the water vapor line. The group delay is practically independent of frequency in the VHF, UHF and <b>microwave</b> <b>bands.</b> However, all three parameters exhibit a similar seasonal dependence originating presumably from the seasonal dependence of the water vapor content. Some of the interesting results obtained from analyses of radiosonde data over the Indian subcontinent collected by the India Meteorological Department is presented...|$|R
500|$|A {{waveguide}} filter is {{an electronic}} filter that is constructed with waveguide technology. [...] Waveguides are hollow metal tubes inside which an electromagnetic wave may be transmitted. [...] Filters are devices used to allow signals at some frequencies to pass (the passband), {{while others are}} rejected (the stopband). [...] Filters are a basic component of electronic engineering designs and have numerous applications. [...] These include selection of signals and limitation of noise. [...] Waveguide filters are most useful in the <b>microwave</b> <b>band</b> of frequencies, where they are a convenient size and have low loss. [...] Examples of microwave filter use are found in satellite communications, telephone networks, and television broadcasting.|$|E
500|$|At {{microwave}} frequencies, none of {{the transfer}} matrices based on port voltages and currents are convenient to use in practice. [...] Voltage is difficult to measure directly, current next to impossible, and the open circuits and short circuits required by the measurement technique cannot be achieved with any accuracy. [...] For waveguide implementations, circuit voltage and current are entirely meaningless. [...] Transfer matrices using different sorts of variables are used instead. [...] These are the powers tranmitted into, and reflected from a port which are readily measured in the transmission line technology used in distributed-element circuits in the <b>microwave</b> <b>band.</b> [...] The most well known and widely used of these sorts of parameters is the scattering parameters, or s-parameters.|$|E
500|$|A {{distributed}} element filter is {{an electronic}} filter in which capacitance, inductance and resistance (the {{elements of the}} circuit) are not localised in discrete capacitors, inductors and resistors {{as they are in}} conventional filters. Its purpose is to allow a range of signal frequencies to pass, but to block others. Conventional filters are constructed from inductors and capacitors, and the circuits so built are described by the lumped element model, which considers each element to be [...] "lumped together" [...] at one place. That model is conceptually simple, but it becomes increasingly unreliable as the frequency of the signal increases, or equivalently as the wavelength decreases. The distributed element model applies at all frequencies, and is used in transmission line theory; many distributed element components are made of short lengths of transmission line. In the distributed view of circuits, the elements are distributed along the length of conductors and are inextricably mixed together. The filter design is usually concerned only with inductance and capacitance, but because of this mixing of elements they cannot be treated as separate [...] "lumped" [...] capacitors and inductors. There is no precise frequency above which distributed element filters must be used but they are especially associated with the <b>microwave</b> <b>band</b> (wavelength less than one metre).|$|E

2500|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory {{developed}} a maser to provide ultra-low-noise amplification of S-band microwave signals received from deep space probes. This maser used deeply refrigerated hydrogen to chill the amplifier {{down to a}} temperature of four kelvin. Amplification was achieved by exciting a ruby comb with a 12.0 gigahertz klystron. In the early years, it took days to chill and remove the impurities from the hydrogen lines. Refrigeration was a two-stage process with a large Linde unit on the ground, and a crosshead compressor within the antenna. The final injection was at [...] through a [...] micrometer-adjustable entry to the chamber. The whole system noise temperature looking at cold sky (2.7 kelvins in the <b>microwave</b> <b>band)</b> was 17 kelvins. This gave such a low noise figure that the Mariner IV space probe could send still pictures from Mars back to the Earth even though the output power of its radio transmitter was only 15 watts, and hence the total signal power received was only -169 decibels {{with respect to a}} milliwatt (dBm).|$|E
2500|$|During {{the past}} century, {{astronomy}} has been revolutionized {{by the use}} of new methods for observing the universe. Astronomical observations were originally made using visible light. Galileo Galilei pioneered the use of telescopes to enhance these observations. However, visible light is {{only a small portion of}} the electromagnetic spectrum, and not all objects in the distant universe shine strongly in this particular band. More useful information may be found, for example, in radio wavelengths. Using radio telescopes, astronomers have found pulsars, quasars, and other extreme objects that push the limits of our understanding of physics. Observations in the <b>microwave</b> <b>band</b> have opened our eyes to the faint imprints of the Big Bang, a discovery Stephen Hawking called the [...] "greatest discovery of the century, if not all time". Similar advances in observations using gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet light, and infrared light have also brought new insights to astronomy. As each of these regions of the spectrum has opened, new discoveries have been made that could not have been made otherwise. Astronomers hope that the same holds true of gravitational waves.|$|E

30|$|Unlike other space {{geodetic}} techniques {{based on}} <b>microwave</b> <b>bands</b> and automatic data acquisition, {{the operation of}} SLR is dependent on weather conditions and often relies on human resources at a ground station.

Hence, it is too optimistic to expect horizon-to-horizon coverage of all possible passes.|$|R

50|$|Microwaves {{are widely}} used for {{point-to-point}} communications because their small wavelength allows conveniently-sized antennas to direct them in narrow beams, which can be pointed directly at the receiving antenna. This allows nearby microwave equipment {{to use the same}} frequencies without interfering with each other, as lower frequency radio waves do. Another advantage is that the high frequency of microwaves gives the <b>microwave</b> <b>band</b> a very large information-carrying capacity; the <b>microwave</b> <b>band</b> has a bandwidth 30 times that of {{all the rest of the}} radio spectrum below it. A disadvantage is that microwaves are limited to line of sight propagation; they cannot pass around hills or mountains as lower frequency radio waves can.|$|E

40|$|Microwave {{vegetation}} index (MVI) is a vegetation index {{defined in}} <b>microwave</b> <b>bands.</b> It {{has been developed}} based on observations from AMSR-E and widely used to monitor global vegetation. Recently, our study found that MVI {{was influenced by the}} atmosphere, although it was calculated from <b>microwave</b> <b>bands.</b> Ignoring the atmospheric influence might bring obvious uncertainty to the study of global vegetation. In this study, an atmospheric effect sensitivity analysis for MVI was carried out, and an atmospheric correction algorithm was developed to reduce the influence of the atmosphere. The sensitivity analysis showed that water vapor, clouds and precipitation were main parameters that had an influence on MVI. The result of the atmospheric correction on MVI was validated at both temporal and spatial scales. The validation showed that the atmospheric correction algorithm developed in this study could obviously improve the underestimation of MVI on most land surfaces. Seasonal patterns in the uncorrected MVI were obviously related to atmospheric water content besides vegetation changes. In addition, global maps of MVI showed significant differences before and after atmospheric correction in the northern hemisphere in the northern summer. The atmospheric correction will make the MVI more reliable and improve its performance in calculating vegetation biomass...|$|R
