5|$|Little {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} and most successful practitioners of <b>market</b> <b>manipulation,</b> making his fortune by leveraging both short sales and short sellers. In the former, he would sell stocks to other traders under contract to purchase it at a later date, betting that the market value would go down in the future and he could pocket the difference (trade rules have changed, and short selling is more complicated than this today). In the latter he would execute the opposite maneuver, corner a market by buying up all of the bonds of a particular company or sector, up-ticking the price so as to make a profit at the expense of any short sales based on those stocks. Hardworking, highly ambitious, and with his eyes set on the very top from the very beginning, Little commonly spent twelve hours a day working on such maneuvers in his office and a further six during the evening engaged in currency speculation.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} market started with comic book stores, and hobby shops displaying and selling cards, with the cards' values determined somewhat arbitrarily {{by the employees}} of the store. With {{the expansion of the}} internet, prices of cards were determined by the amount of tournament deck lists a given card would appear in. If a card was played in a tournament more frequently, the cost of the card would be higher (in addition to the market availability of the card). When eBay, Amazon, and other large online markets started to gain popularity, the Magic {{secondary market}} evolved substantially. Buying and selling Magic cards online became a source of income for people who learned how to manipulate the market. Today, the secondary market is so large and complex, it has become an area of study for consumer research, and some people make a career out of <b>market</b> <b>manipulation,</b> creating mathematical models to analyze the growth of cards' worth, and predict the market value of both individual cards, and entire sets of cards.|$|E

5|$|Little was not {{the first}} to gain and lose his fortune in the stock market, but he was a {{pioneering}} speculator, the first to rely on his ability to predict market fluctuations to inform his speculations instead of bidding with what would today be considered insider information. He was the first Great Bear; before his rapid rise speculation and <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> was virtually unknown in the stock market, as no one before him had had the still nerve and financial foresight necessary to profit from such risky endeavors, and many market historians consider him the first modern stock market tycoon. His ability to gain and lose fortunes on a day-by-day basis was a microcosm of the meteoric possibilities and insecurities of speculation, and after his death and even during his life many other investors tried to imitate his success, with little success. His victory over the Erie Railroad scheme (and market cornering activities in general) inspired similar plots in the years thereafter; in 1863 the industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt successfully cornered the Harlem Railroad {{in much the same way}} that Little had done almost thirty years earlier, and fell into a corner trap formed by Daniel Drew and others himself in the later Erie War. This did much to give credence to convertible bonds, then still a novelty.|$|E

25|$|However, {{competitive}} {{markets are}} not without limitations. Basic economic theory dictates that for competition to exist, {{a large number of}} market participants are required. Experience with deregulation in the United States and the United Kingdom, however, has shown that competitive markets can lead to market power concentration and <b>market</b> <b>manipulation.</b> In these jurisdictions, the market has been threatened by the strategic behaviour of incumbents and new entrants that have too large a market share. The case of Enron in California is a prime example. For a competitive market to function, firms cannot significantly influence prices by adjusting or shutting down supply individually.|$|E
25|$|The {{remuneration}} of generators in {{the spot}} market did not generate interest from private producers to obtain high returns and therefore install new capacity.

In order to address this problem, in 2003 and 2004, the Government instituted rules for allowing competitively bid long-term contract prices to be reflected in consumer tariffs and empowered the regulator to shift to a cost-based market if evidence of <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> emerged.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{subsequent}} Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's investigation and report, numerous energy trading companies, many based in Texas, such as Enron Corporation, illegally restricted their {{supply to the}} point where the spikes in power usage would cause blackouts. Rolling blackouts affecting 97,000 customers hit the San Francisco Bay area on June 14, 2000 and San Diego Gas & Electric Company filed a complaint alleging <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> by some energy producers in August 2000. On December 7, 2000, suffering from low supply and idled power plants, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), which manages the California power grid, declared the first statewide Stage 3 power alert, meaning power reserves were below 3 percent. Rolling blackouts were avoided when the state halted two large state and federal water pumps to conserve electricity.|$|E

In developing what would become Standard Oil, Rockefeller, a manager of extraordinary abilities, and Flagler, an exceptional marketer, recognized that the costs {{and control of the}} shipment of crude oil would be key elements in competition with other refiners. With its combination of clever <b>market</b> <b>manipulation,</b> and hard-nosed dealings with the powerful Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), the South Improvement scheme was an example of the type of business tactics which Rockefeller and his associates used to become successful.

40|$|Barrier {{options are}} the most common path-dependent options traded in {{financial}} markets. They are particularly attractive to investors, because not only are they cheaper than vanilla options but they also offer different choices of investment, which allow investors to bet their views on the movement of the underlying asset prices. The “one-touch” breaching barrier however is prone to <b>market</b> <b>manipulations</b> which can be made by influential agents in order to free them from their liabilities to the option holders. Aiming to prevent such <b>market</b> <b>manipulations,</b> Parisian options were introduced, with an extended trigger clause, which makes the knock-in or knock-out feature much harder to be activated. Pricing Parisian options has become an increasingly important problem from both financial and mathematical perspectives. Financially, the introduction of Parisian options, which makes the market fairer {{in the sense that it}} protects the holder of Parisian options from deliberate action taken by the writer, requires an efficient way to precisely evaluate the option prices. On the other hand, due to the presence of the newly-added trigger clause, the valuation of Parisian options becomes a three-dimensional problem, a challenging problem, which has hindered the application of various mathematical methods. In this thesis, we explore the integral equation method and the “moving window” technique to price different types of Parisian options under the Black-Scholes framework...|$|R
