The dispersion of the fabricated photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) {{is as high as}} – 600 ps/nm·km at 1550 nm. By employing PCFs to increase the dispersion, the TTD module size can be proportionally reduced. The time delay is continuously tunable from- 31 picosecond to 31 picosecond between adjacent delay lines by tuning the laser wavelength continuously from 1528 nm to 1560 nm. The far field radiation patterns of a 1 × 4 subarray were measured from – 45 o to 45 o scanning angles. Squint-free operation is experimentally confirmed. Wavelength conversion is also demonstrated to confirm that time delay information can successfully transferred from one wavelength to the other without being changed, which is suitable to be implemented in 2 -D phased array antenna systems.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study has been}} made of the navigation performance which might be achieved for the high cross-range space shuttle orbiter during final approach and landing by using an optimally augmented inertial navigation system. Computed navigation accuracies are presented for an on-board inertial navigation system augmented (by means of an optimal filter algorithm) with data from two different ground navigation aids; a precision ranging system and a <b>microwave</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> landing guidance system. These results show that augmentation with either type of ground navigation aid is capable of providing a navigation performance at touchdown which should be adequate for the space shuttle.

40|$|Currently, laser {{perfusion}} imaging (LDPI) {{is undergoing}} a technology shift from <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> perfusion imagers to whole field systems. The latter can be subdivided in laser Doppler methods systems based on high speed CMOS cameras, and laser speckle contrast analysis (LASCA) technologies using slow imaging arrays, mostly CCD-based. In <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> systems, a collimated laser <b>beam</b> <b>scans</b> the tissue with diffusely back reflected light being captured with a single detector. In whole field systems a large tissue area is illuminated, and the reflected light is imaged onto an array and captured at once. Unlike <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> systems, both whole field methods enable perfusion imaging at video rate. In this study we experimentally compare the <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> LDPI principle with whole field LDPI, using Intralipid phantoms. For the tissue phantoms, the Monte Carlo simulation technique {{will be used as}} a reference. From measurements on Intralipid phantoms compared to Monte Carlo, we conclude that in whole field LDPI the flux image, representing the first order moment of the power spectrum of photocurrent fluctuations is much closer related to real perfusion than for <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> systems. This difference can be explained in terms of the different behaviour of dynamic speckle patterns generated in both methods, in response to varying tissue optical propertie...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the first}} Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) was {{demonstrated}} in a dilute atomic gas [1], rotating BECs {{have been of}} interest to researchers due to their quantized circulation. We propose a new method of creating controlled vortices in a BEC. Atoms are held in {{the focus of a}} <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> that rapidly <b>scans</b> to produce a time-averaged potential [2]. We have made theoretical calculations to measure the heating caused by a <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> trap and to find the regime where a <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> produces a time-averaged potential. The <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> splits the BEC into four parts then imprints a relative phase on each part such that, when the parts recombine, a vortex forms. We have simulated such a system using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and have demonstrated the laser scanning pattern using a two-dimensional acousto-optic modulator (AOM). The optics for the <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> trap have been designed and the experimental trap dimensions are used in our simulations. To carry out the experimental part of this project, we are currently building and testing an all-optical BEC apparatus: we have made a magneto-optical trap (MOT) which cools the 87 Rb atomsto 30 uK.

40|$|A {{series of}} Global Positioning System (GPS) flight tests were {{performed}} on a National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Shuttle Training Aircraft (STA). The objective of the tests was to evaluate the performance of GPS-based navigation during simulated Shuttle approach and landings for possible replacement of the current Shuttle landing navigation aid, the <b>Microwave</b> <b>Scanning</b> <b>Beam</b> Landing System (MSBLS). In particular, varying levels of sensor data integration would be evaluated to determine the minimum amount of integration required to meet the navigation accuracy requirements for a Shuttle landing. Four flight tests consisting of 8 to 9 simulation runs per flight test were performed at White Sands Space Harbor in April 1991. Three different GPS receivers were tested.

Data obtained from flight testing at Shuttle landing sites reveal MSBLS distance measuring equipment performance to be very good, with elevation errors found at very low elevation angles and azimuth errors as a function of aircraft attitude. The Precision Laser Tracking System has thus proven to be a satisfactory instrument for determining MSBLS performance, and an ideal instrument for its calibration...|$|E

Updates are periodically received from ground tracking stations. IMU continues attitude information, and additional references are made with an automated startracker device. Information can also be gathered by optical alignment, and future systems will include radar tracking in an approach mode. Deorbit is accompanied by IMU altitude measurements as well as calculations of altitude based on drag measurements. Barometric measurements begin at about 80, 000 ft altitude.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore the performance of a VTOL aircraft landing approach navigation system that receives data (1) from either a <b>microwave</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> (MSB) or a radar-transponder (R-T) landing guidance system, and (2) information data-linked from an aviation facility ship. State-of-the-art low-cost-aided inertial techniques and variable gain filters were used in the assumed navigation system. Compensation for ship motion was accomplished by a landing pad deviation vector concept that is a measure of the landing pad's deviation from its calm sea location. The results show that the landing guidance concepts were successful in meeting all of the current Navy navigation error specifications, provided that vector magnitude of the allowable error, rather than the error in each axis, is a permissible interpretation of acceptable performance. The success of these concepts, however, is strongly dependent on the distance measuring equipment bias. In addition, the 'best possible' closed-loop tracking performance achievable with the assumed point-mass VTOL aircraft guidance concept is demonstrated...|$|E

50|$|The first fully {{functional}} low-velocity <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> tube, the CPS Emitron, {{was invented}} and {{demonstrated by the}} EMI team {{under the supervision of}} Isaac Shoenberg. In 1934, the EMI engineers Blumlein and McGee filed for patents for television transmitting systems where a charge storage plate was shielded by a pair of special grids, a negative (or slightly positive) grid lay very close to the plate, and a positive one was placed further away. The velocity and energy of the electrons in the <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> were reduced to zero by the decelerating electric field generated by this pair of grids, and so a low-velocity <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> tube was obtained.
