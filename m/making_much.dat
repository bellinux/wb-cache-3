5|$|The U2 360° Tour was the highest-grossing tour of 2009, with {{earnings}} of over $311million for the year's 44 shows, and around 3million ticket sales. Due {{to the high}} costs to operate the tour, U2's profits were minimal. Sales of No Line on the Horizon had been slow, meaning the group was not <b>making</b> <b>much</b> money from that either. Through November 2010, the tour's first 66 shows had grossed $443million and sold 4.3million tickets. At the 2010 Billboard Touring Awards, U2 were honored for the year's Top Tour and Top Draw for U2 360°.|$|E

In his first match back, he took five Orange Free State wickets for 53 runs (and three more in the second innings).

25|$|The newer concentric-float {{fill valve}} {{consists}} of a tower which is encircled by a plastic float assembly. Operation is otherwise {{the same as a}} side-float fill valve, even though the float position is somewhat different. By virtue of its more compact layout, interference between the float and other obstacles (tank insulation, flush valve, and so on) is greatly reduced, thus increasing reliability. The concentric-float fill valve is also designed to signal to users automatically when there is a leak in the tank, by <b>making</b> <b>much</b> more noise when a leak is present than the older style side-float fill valve, which tends to be nearly silent when a slow leak is present.|$|E

25|$|From {{an early}} stage in 1984, before the {{official}} announcement of the councils to be rate-capped, Basildon had worked {{on the assumption that}} it would have its budget restricted. In March, prior to the capping list being announced, the council leadership invited the Audit Commission to independently investigate its spending, hoping that it would vindicate the council's decisions. The report found that the council's high spending was not the result of inefficiency but of policy decisions, and the fact that as a new town it had higher interest payments and higher spending on managing housing. The council duly published the report after it was capped, <b>making</b> <b>much</b> {{of the fact that the}} Audit Commission had exonerated it.|$|E
25|$|The {{estimates}} on {{the number}} of participants in the Labour Day celebrations on Taksim Square in 1977 is usually given as 500,000 citizens. Many participants and in particular the Maoist bloc had not even entered the square when shots were heard. Most witnesses stated that they came from the building of the water supply company (Sular İdaresi) and Intercontinental Hotel (now the Marmara Hotel), the tallest building in Istanbul in 1977. Subsequently the security forces intervened with armoured vehicles <b>making</b> <b>much</b> noise with their sirens and explosives. They also hosed the crowd with pressurized water. People tried to escape through Kazancı Yokuşu, the nearest exit from the square, however a track blocked escape route. Most casualties were caused by the panic that police intervention created.|$|E
25|$|Educated at Taunton School, {{where he}} was an {{outstanding}} schoolboy cricketer, Marshall played in six Somerset matches in the 1914 season. After war service, {{he went back to}} Taunton School as a schoolmaster and stayed there until his retirement in 1955, playing much club cricket in the Taunton area. He reappeared in the Somerset side for a few games in the 1922, 1923 and 1926 seasons, without <b>making</b> <b>much</b> impact. His highest score was 37 in the match against Leicestershire at Leicester in 1922. In 1927, he played nine matches, and at times batted as high as No 4 in the batting order, but without success: he did, however, achieve his best bowling figures with three wickets for 51 runs in a rain-affected game against Glamorgan at Bath.|$|E

It is now 2014 and they have not met their goal.|$|E
25|$|His {{successor}} at the Lyceum was Theophrastus, {{who wrote}} valuable books describing {{plant and animal}} life. His works are regarded as the first to put botany and zoology on a systematic footing. He also produced {{one of the very}} first works on mineralogy, with descriptions of ores and minerals known to the world at that time. He made some shrewd observations of their properties. For example, he made the first known reference to the phenomenon of pyroelectricity, noting that the mineral tourmaline becomes charged when heated. Pliny the Elder makes clear references to his use of the work in his Naturalis Historia of 77 AD, while updating and <b>making</b> <b>much</b> new information available on minerals himself. From both these early texts was to emerge the science of mineralogy, and ultimately geology. Both authors describe the sources of the minerals they discuss in the various mines exploited in their time, so their works should be regarded not just as early scientific texts, but also important for the history of engineering and the history of technology. Pliny is especially significant because he provides full bibliographic details of the earlier authors and their works he uses and consults. Because his encyclopedia survived the Dark Ages, we know of these lost works, even if the texts themselves have disappeared. The book {{was one of the first}} to be printed in 1489, and became a standard reference work for Renaissance scholars, as well as an inspiration for the development of a scientific and rational approach to the world.|$|E
