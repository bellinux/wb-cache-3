2500|$|The Current Population Survey (CPS) is {{a monthly}} survey of about 60,000 U.S. {{households}} conducted monthly by the United States Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The BLS uses {{the data to}} publish reports early each month called the Employment Situation. This report provides estimates of the unemployment rate and the numbers of employed and unemployed people in the United States based on the CPS. A readable Employment Situation Summary is provided monthly. [...] Annual estimates include employment and unemployment in large metropolitan areas. Researchers can use some CPS <b>microdata</b> to investigate these or other topics.|$|E

50|$|DUALabs (National Data Use and Access Laboratories) was {{the name}} of an American company that created and disseminated <b>microdata</b> and {{aggregate}} data files for the 1960 and 1970 censuses. The DUALabs 1960 census <b>microdata</b> file was noteworthy because it was designed to compatible with data from the 1970 census, allowing easy analysis of economic and demographic change between 1960 and 1970. The compatible DUALabs <b>microdata</b> inspired the Integrated Public Use <b>Microdata</b> Series which provides compatible census <b>microdata</b> for the period since 1850.|$|E

50|$|For this reason, some {{statistical}} organizations allow {{access to}} <b>microdata</b> for research purposes. Controls are generally imposed {{to limit the}} risk that this data may be abused or lead to loss of privacy. For example, the Integrated Public Use <b>Microdata</b> Series requires researchers to implement security measures, avoid redistribution of <b>microdata,</b> use <b>microdata</b> only for noncommercial research/education purposes, and not make any attempt to identify the individuals recorded. Names and fine-level geographical data are removed, some data items are altered as necessary to {{make it impossible to}} identify individuals, and small ethnic categories are merged.|$|E

PUMS data contain responses to every question from a sample of respondents. To protect respondent privacy, PUMS data are anonymized and only available down to areas containing 100,000 people or more known as Public Use <b>Microdata</b> Areas (PUMAs). The analysis of all ACS <b>microdata</b> without the sampling and anonymization in PUMS is restricted to qualified researchers at secure Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDCs).|$|E

50|$|In 1976, CMC {{merged with}} <b>Microdata</b> Corporation, a California-based {{computer}} company, whose 1973-released Reality operating and database environment product CMC was also distributing. The companies {{continued to use}} separate trading names in their respective regions until 1981. The Reality name was given to Microdata's computer system and the operating systemâ€”a version of the Pick operating system. At the time, <b>Microdata</b> owned rights to the Pick Operating system in parallel with Dick Pick - who had developed it with <b>Microdata.</b> CMC Leasing Limited (the official trading name) then {{changed its name to}} <b>Microdata</b> UK limited, aka MUK. The company then started UK manufacture of the Reality range of computer systems in its manufacturing factory in Maxted Road, Hemel Hempstead. <b>Microdata</b> was purchased by McDonnell Douglas Corporation in 1985 and the company was re-branded as McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Limited (MDIS).|$|E

50|$|Mow {{earned a}} BSEE from Rensselaer Polytechnic, an MSEE from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn and a Ph.D. from Purdue University. After earning his Ph.D., Mow spent {{the years from}} 1967 to 1969 working for Litton Industries as a program manager before forming his first {{business}} in 1969. It was a computer-controlled instrumentation firm called <b>Microdata.</b> <b>Microdata</b> designed new ways to test large-scale integrated computer chips. By 1974, <b>Microdata</b> had annual sales of $12 million. In the mid-1970s, Mow sold <b>Microdata</b> to Cutler-Hammer, a conglomerate located in Milwaukee. He remained on as chairman and CEO, but resigned after the new owners accused him of concealing $2 million worth of losses. Later, in 1988, a California court cleared Mow of any accusations and found that Cutler-Hammer had actually been responsible for concealing the sales loss.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{machine was}} a <b>Microdata</b> 800 microcomputer first made in 1969. This computer was licensed to the French company Intertechnique who sold it in Europe {{under the name}} Multi-8. It was particularly in use in nuclear power stations, research applications (such as crystallography and biology) and process control. Later this evolved into the <b>Microdata</b> 1600, {{an updated version of}} the 800 processor (commercialized under the name Multi-4 by Intertechnique). The original development of Reality was done on <b>Microdata</b> 800. The first Reality system was based on the 1600 and was sold commercially in 1973. The unique feature of the early <b>Microdata</b> processors was that the microcode was accessible to the user and allowed the creation of custom assembler level instructions. The Reality system design made extensive use of this capability.|$|E
