40|$|The UOP Co-Processing {{scheme is}} a {{single-stage}} slurry catalyzed {{process in which}} petroleum vacuum resid and coal are simultaneously upgraded to a high-quality synthetic oil. A highly active dispersed catalyst has been developed which enables {{the operation of the}} co-processing unit at relatively moderate and high temperatures and relatively high pressure. Under the current contract, a multi-year research program was undertaken to study the technical and economic feasibility of this technology. All the contractual tasks were completed. Autoclave experiments were carried out to evaluate dispersed vanadium catalysts, molybdenum catalysts, and a less costly UOP-proprietary catalyst preparation technique. Autoclave experiments were also carried out in support of the continuous pilot plant unit operation and to study the effects of the process variables (pressure, temperature, and metal loading on the catalyst). A total of 24 continuous pilot plant runs were made. Research and development efforts during the pilot plant operations were concentrated on addressing the cost effectiveness of the UOP single-stage slurry catalyzed co-processing concept based on UOP experience gained in the previous DOE contract. To this end, effect of catalyst metal concentration was studied and a highly-active Mo-based catalyst was developed. This catalyst enabled successful long-term operation (924 hours) of the continuous bench-scale plant at highly severe operating conditions of 3, 000 psig, 465 {degree}C temperature, and 2 : 1 resid-to-MAF (moisture- <b>and</b> <b>ash-free)</b> <b>coal</b> ratio with 0. 1 wt % active metal. The metal loading of the catalyst was low enough to consider the catalyst as a disposable slurry catalyst. Also, liquid recycle was incorporated in the pilot plant design to increase the, reactor back mixing and to increase the flow of liquid through the reactor (to introduce turbulence in the reactor) and to represent the design of a commercial-scale reactor...|$|R

40|$|Torrefaction {{tests were}} carried out on {{miscanthus}} samples {{in order to understand}} the changes in chemical composition at temperatures of 250 – 350 °C and residence times of 30 – 120 minutes. The raw material chemical composition was moisture content 7. 97 %, moisture-free carbon (C) 47. 73 %, hydrogen (H) 5. 85 %, nitrogen (N) 0. 28 %, sulphur (S) 0. 02 %, volatiles (V) 83. 29 % for volatiles, <b>and</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> <b>ash-free</b> (MAF) calorific value (CV) 8423 BTU/lb (19. 59 MJ/kg). Torrefaction at temperatures of 250 °C and residence time of 30 minutes resulted in a significant decrease in moisture by about 82. 68 %, but the other components, C, H, N, S, and V changed only marginally. Increasing the torrefaction temperature to 350 °C and residence time to 120 minutes further reduced the moisture to a final value of 0. 54 % (a 93. 2 % reduction compared to original) and also resulted in a significant decrease in the other components, H, N, and V by 58. 29 %, 14. 28 %, and 70. 45 %, respectively. The carbon content at 350 °C and 120 minutes increased by about 4 % and sulfur values were below detection limits. The calorific values increased by about 5. 59 % at 250 °C and 30 minutes, whereas at 350 °C and 120 minutes, the increase was much greater (about 75. 61 %) and resulted in a maximum degree of carbonization of 1. 60. The H/C ratio decreased with an increase in torrefaction temperature, where a minimum value of 0. 6 was observed at 350 °C and 120 minutes. The regression equations developed with respect to torrefaction temperature and times have adequately described the changes in chemical composition. The surface plots developed based on the regression equations indicate that torrefaction temperatures of 300 – 350 °C and residence times of 30 – 120 minutes residence time can help to increase carbon content, calorific value, and degree of carbonization to > 49. 4 %, > 11, 990 BTU/lb (27 MJ/kg), and 1. 4, <b>and</b> reduce <b>moisture,</b> nitrogen, volatile, <b>and</b> the H/C ratio to 0. 525 – 0. 725, 2. 9 – 3. 9, 0. 225 – 0. 235, and < 1. 4...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} heat {{treatment}} {{on the structure}} of an Australian semi-anthracite char was studied in detail in the 850 - 1150 degreesC temperature range using XRD, HRTEM, and electrical resistivity techniques. It was found that the carbon crystallite size in the char does not change significantly during heat treatment in the temperature range studied, for both the raw <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> its <b>ash-free</b> derivative obtained by acid treatment. However, the fraction of the organized carbon in the raw coal chars, determined by XRD, increased with increase of heat treatment time and temperature, while that for the <b>ash-free</b> <b>coal</b> chars remained almost unchanged. This suggests the occurrence of catalytic ordering during heat treatment, supported by the observation that the electrical resistivity of the raw coal chars decreased with heat treatment, while that of the <b>ash-free</b> <b>coal</b> chars did not vary significantly. Further confirmatory evidence was provided by high resolution transmission electron micrographs depicting well-organized carbon layers surrounding iron particles. It is also found that the fraction of organized carbon does not reach unity, but attains an apparent equilibrium value that increases with increase in temperature, providing an apparent heat of ordering of 71. 7 kJ mol(- 1) in the temperature range studied. Good temperature-independent correlation was found between the electrical resistivity and the organized carbon fraction, indicating that electrical resistivity is indeed structure sensitive. Good correlation was also found between the electrical resistivity and the reactivity of coal char. All these results strongly suggest that the thermal deactivation {{is the result of a}} crystallite-perfecting process, which is effectively catalyzed by the inorganic matter in the coal char. Based on kinetic interpretation of the data it is concluded that the process is diffusion controlled, most likely involving transport of iron in the inter-crystallite nanospaces in the temperature range studied. The activation energy of this transport process is found to be very low, at about 11. 8 kJ mol(- 1), which is corroborated by model-free correlation of the temporal variation of organized carbon fraction as well as electrical resistivity data using the superposition method, and is suggestive of surface transport of iron.

To minimise {{the loss of}} carbon in the residue stream, {{it is necessary to}} have a low-ash feed. Typically the coal should be <10% ash by weight.

Our study explored how the relative balance of autotrophic and heterotrophic constituents in stream biofilms influences nutrient limitation at sixteen sites in three urban watersheds in Utah. We measured nutrient limitation with nutrient diffusing substrates containing nitrogen (NH 4 -N), phosphorus (PO 4 -P), both nitrogen and phosphorus, or no nutrients. Biofilm responses to nutrient additions were measured as chlorophyll a (autotrophs) <b>and</b> <b>ash-free</b> dry mass (autotrophs + heterotrophs). Nutrient additions affected chlorophyll levels at ten sites. Most commonly, autotrophs were co-limited by N and P (three sites) or primarily limited by N and secondarily limited by P (three sites). Nutrient additions suppressed chlorophyll levels at four sites. Nutrient additions affected ash-free dry mass at only three sites, suppressing biomass at two sites, and increasing biomass at one site. At a given site, chlorophyll a <b>and</b> <b>ash-free</b> dry mass never had the same response to nutrient additions.

40|$|Coal topping {{gasification}} {{refers to}} a process that extracts the volatiles contained in coal into gas and tar rich in chemical structures in advance of gasification. The technology can be implemented in a reactor system coupling a fluidized bed pyrolyzer and a transport bed gasifier in which coal is first pyrolyzed in the fluidized bed before being forwarded into the transport bed for gasification. The present article is devoted to investigating the pyrolysis of lignite and bituminite in a fluidized bed reactor. The {{results showed that the}} highest tar yield appeared at 823 to 923 K for both coals. When coal ash from CFB boiler was used as the bed material, obvious decreases in the yields of tar and pyrolysis gas were observed. Pyrolysis in a reaction atmosphere simulating the pyrolysis gas composition of coal resulted in a higher production of tar. Under the conditions of using CFB boiler ash as the bed material and the simulated pyrolysis gas as the reaction atmosphere, the tar yields for pyrolytic topping in a fluidized bed reactor was about 11. 4 wt. % for bituminite and 6. 5 wt. % for lignite in dry <b>ash-free</b> <b>coal</b> base.

40|$|Biochar was {{produced}} by fixed-bed slow pyrolysis from various feedstock biomasses under a range of process conditions. Feedstocks used were pine wood, wheat straw, green waste and dried algae. Process conditions varied were the highest treatment temperature (HTT) and residence time. The produced chars were characterized by proximate analysis, CHN-elemental analysis, pH in solution, bomb calorimetry for higher heating value, N 2 adsorption for BET surface area and two biological degradation assays (oxygen demand, carbon mineralization in soil). In proximate analysis, {{it was found that}} the fixed carbon content (expressed in wt% of dry <b>and</b> <b>ash-free</b> biochar) in the biochar samples strongly depended on the intensity of the thermal treatment (i. e. higher temperatures and longer residence times in the pyrolysis process). The actual yield in fixed carbon (i. e. the biochar fixed carbon content expressed as wt% of the dry <b>and</b> <b>ash-free</b> original feedstock biomass weight) was practically insensitive to the highest treatment temperature or residence time. The pH in solution, higher heating value and BET surface positively correlated with pyrolysis temperature. Finally, soil incubation tests showed that the addition of biochar to the soil initially marginally reduced the C-mineralization rate compared against the control soil samples, for which a possible explanation could be that the soil microbial community needs to adapt to the new conditions. This effect was more pronounced when adding chars with high fixed carbon content (resulting from more severe thermal treatment), as chars with low fixed carbon content (produced through mild thermal treatment) had a larger amount of volatile, more easily biodegradable, carbon compounds...|$|R

It is based on over 29, 000 analyses of the volatile matter moisture- <b>and</b> <b>ash-free</b> (Vdaf) from surface and underground boreholes drilled in 1946 – 1989. Vitrinite reflectance (Rmax) cannot be used as a measure of coalification in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin: the number of reflectance measurements is small and their distribution over the basin area is very uneven. Statistical data on Vdaf for the individual stratal units were processed. Modelling of the trends in the volatile matter moisture- <b>and</b> <b>ash-free</b> (Vdaf) depending on “stratigraphic depth” proved the general applicability of Hilt's law. The distribution of this parameter in selected boreholes and segments of the basin was also studied, and coalification gradients were calculated. Coalification in specific examples (boreholes) is, however, highly variable and shows numerous deviations from Hilt's law even within individual boreholes, which is documented on a real example. The causes of some of the deviations are relatively well known (e. g., effect of elevated pressure in tectonically deformed areas, effect of effusive rocks or paleoweathering zones) while others can be presumed (heat flows due to Variscan and Carpathian orogenies affected by the lithology of the Carboniferous massif).
