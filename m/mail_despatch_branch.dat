50|$|An Army Post Office {{was set up}} in the Headquarters in Brussels {{with two}} clerks. <b>Mails</b> were <b>despatched</b> to and from the {{headquarters}} via Ostend (Belgium) where the British Post Office Agent was Charles Sevright. Army Post Offices operated in France until the withdrawal of British troops in 1817.|$|R
60|$|On {{the next}} day about noon the post did pass them, {{consisting}} of three strong men carrying great weights on their backs, suspended by bands from their foreheads. They travelled much quicker than our friends, and would reach {{the banks of the}} river that evening. In their ordinary course they would start down the river close upon daybreak on the following day; but, after some consultation with the guides, they agreed to wait till noon. Poor Mrs. Arkwright knew nothing of hours or of any such arrangements now, but her husband greatly doubted their power of catching this <b>mail</b> <b>despatch.</b> However, it did not much depend on their exertions that afternoon. Their resting-place was marked out for them, and they could not go beyond it, unless indeed they could make the whole journey, which was impossible.|$|R
5000|$|The {{telephone}} {{was connected}} in 1907, and by 1949 the Toodyay (telephone) Exchange serviced about 120 local connections. At {{this time the}} staff comprised three postal assistants and four telephonists. Nine <b>mails</b> were <b>despatched</b> weekly to Perth and ten were received via a taxi service ("Miss Toodyay" [...] operating out of the Toodyay Garage) or by rail.|$|R
50|$|By May 1854, a {{new deal}} over the transit cost was struck with the French postal {{authorities}} and this partly solved the problem of holding unpaid <b>mail.</b> <b>Mail</b> was <b>despatched</b> from Britain as before but on its arrival in Constantinople British officers handled it, but unfortunately they had no experience in postal matters and there was soon a buildup of undelivered letters.|$|R
50|$|Six days later, {{she herself}} bombarded Morro Island. Several {{times during the}} summer, she {{returned}} to Key West to load <b>mail,</b> stores, and <b>despatches</b> for the squadron off Havana, and on 14 August she returned to Charleston, S.C.. Foote was out of commission at New York from 28 October 1898 to 9 November 1900, then operated in the Newport-Boston area until placed in reserve at Norfolk 6 March 1901. In 1908 she moved to Charleston.|$|R
50|$|There {{are very}} few covers {{addressed}} to transatlantic destinations before 1872 using Uruguayan stamps. This {{was the result of}} illicit actions by the foreign consulates in Montevideo, who received and <b>despatched</b> <b>mail</b> using ships flying the flags of their own states, with no involvement of any kind by the Uruguayan Mail Service. The British consulate in Montevideo used British stamps between 1862 and 1872 which may be identified by the cancel 'C28'. Overseas correspondence was franked with Uruguayan stamps from the end of 1872 onwards, following the so-called Montevideo Postal Incident in which the government prohibited all non-Uruguay mail inside Uruguay.|$|R
5000|$|Initially it {{was decided}} that the normal {{civilian}} postal service to Turkey and the Black Sea was sufficient and therefore no British Post Office representative was sent to handle the Army's <b>mails.</b> <b>Mail</b> was <b>despatched</b> from London via the French 'overland route' and onto Constantinople (now Istanbul). There it was handed to the French Consular Postal Service who in turn, passed it to the French Army Post Office for distribution to the British Army.Mail from the British Army was despatched on the French packets from Constantinople to Malta. At Malta it was transferred via the British Post Office agent onto vessels bound for Southampton. The outbound system from Britain proved to be both expensive and inadequate. William Howard Russell, The Times correspondent reported: There is always something wrong about our letters. At present the French Post Office here is a receptacle of several hundred letters addressed to the generals, staff officers and officers of every Regiment which the French postmaster refuses to give up until some chivalrous person pays £12 (300 francs) for the whole bundle and to take the chance of being repaid by the various persons.....to whom they are addressed.|$|R
60|$|The {{next few}} days were {{employed}} in repairing the breaches, and putting the place again {{in a state of}} defence, as it was probable that Marmont might come up and besiege it. The French marshal, however, when hurrying to the relief of the town, heard the news of its fall, and as the weather was very bad for campaigning, and provisions short, he fall back again to his winter quarters, believing that Wellington would, content with his success, make no fresh movement until the spring. The English general, however, was far too able a strategist not to profit by the supineness of his adversary, and, immediately Ciudad Rodrigo was taken, he began to make preparations for the siege of Badajos, a far stronger fortress than Ciudad, and defended by strong detached forts. Three days after the fall of Rodrigo General Hill came up with his division; to this the Norfolk Rangers now belonged, and the Scudamores had therefore the delight of meeting all their old friends again. They saw but little of them, however, for they were constantly on the road to Lisbon with <b>despatches,</b> every <b>branch</b> of the service being now strained to get the battering-train destined for the attack on Badajos to the front, while orders were sent to Silviera, Trant, Wilson, Lecca, and the other partisan leaders, to hold all the fords and defiles along the frontier, so as to prevent the French from making a counter-invasion of Portugal.|$|R
6000|$|To {{go round}} the lights, even to-day, is to visit past centuries. The tide of {{tourists}} that flows yearly in Scotland, vulgarising all where it approaches, is still defined by certain barriers. It {{will be long}} ere there is a hotel at Sumburgh or a hydropathic at Cape Wrath; it will be long ere any char-à-banc, laden with tourists, shall drive up to Barra Head or Monach, the Island of the Monks. They are farther from London than St. Petersburg, and except for the towers, sounding and shining all night with fog-bells and the radiance of the light-room, glittering by day with the trivial brightness of white paint, these island and moorland stations seem inaccessible to the civilisation of to-day, and even {{to the end of}} my grandfather’s career the isolation was far greater. There ran no post at all in the Long Island; from the light-house on Barra Head a boat must be sent for letters as far as Tobermory, between sixty and seventy miles of open sea; and the posts of Shetland, which had surprised Sir Walter Scott in 1814, were still unimproved in 1833, when my grandfather reported on the subject. The group contained at the time a population of 30,000 souls, and enjoyed a trade which had increased in twenty years seven-fold, to between three and four thousand tons. Yet the <b>mails</b> were <b>despatched</b> and received by chance coasting vessels at the rate of a penny a letter; six and eight weeks often elapsed between opportunities, and when a mail was to be made up, sometimes at a moment’s notice, the bellman was sent hastily through the streets of Lerwick. Between Shetland and Orkney, only seventy miles apart, there was ‘no trade communication whatever.’ ...|$|R
