25|$|In the {{psychology}} of visual perception and motor control, the term response priming denotes a special form of visuomotor priming effect. The distinctive feature of response priming is that prime and target are presented in quick succession (typically, less than 100 milliseconds apart) and are coupled to identical or alternative motor responses. When a speeded <b>motor</b> <b>response</b> is performed to classify the target stimulus, a prime immediately preceding the target can thus induce response conflicts when assigned to a different response as the target. These response conflicts have observable effects on motor behavior, leading to priming effects, e.g., in response times and error rates. A special property of response priming is its independence from visual awareness of the prime: For example, response priming effects can increase under conditions where visual awareness of the prime is decreasing.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} {{cortical}} stimulation mapping {{dates back to}} the late 19th century. Neurologists David Ferrier and Victor Horsley were some of the first to utilize this technique. Ferrier and Horsley employed CSM to further grasp the structure and function of the pre-Rolandic and post-Rolandic areas, also known as the pre central gyrus and post central gyrus. Prior to the development of more advanced methods, in 1888 C.B. Nancrede utilized a battery operated bipolar probe in order to map the motor cortex. In 1937, Wilder Penfield and Boldrey were able to show that stimulating the precentral gyrus elicited a response contralaterally; a significant finding given that it correlated to the anatomy based on which part of the brain was stimulated. In the early 1900s Charles Sherrington began to use monopolar stimulation in order to elicit a <b>motor</b> <b>response.</b> This technique allowed Sherrington to determine that the precentral gyrus (pre-Rolandic area) is a motor cortex and the postcentral gyrus (post-Rolandic area) is a sensory cortex. These findings, which were repeated by Harvey Cushing through the early 1900s, show that the Rolandic fissure is the point of separation between the motor and sensory cortices. Cushing's work with CSM moved it from an experimental technique to one that became a staple neurosurgery technique used to map the brain and treat epilepsy. Cushing took work that had previously been done on animals, specifically chimpanzees and orangutans, and was able to utilize cortical stimulation mapping to account for the differences between these species and humans. Cushing's work dramatically increased the effectiveness of the treatment utilizing cortical stimulation mapping, as neurosurgeons were now utilizing a more updated picture of the brain.|$|E

Pharyngeal <b>motor</b> <b>responses</b> were more easily elicited in older subjects and palatal responses were more easily elicited in women.

40|$|Microstimulation of the rostral {{portion of}} the corpus callosum (CC) was carried out on 21 awake kittens {{ranging in age from}} 45 to 105 days to {{determine}} the age at which <b>motor</b> <b>responses</b> first appeared and that at which they assumed functional adult-like properties. <b>Motor</b> <b>responses</b> to microstimulation first appeared over an interval ranging from 78 - 86 days postnatally. As in adults, they consisted of discrete, well-localized contractions of shoulder, whisker, and eyelid muscles according to the stimulated sites. In the first days after their appearance, <b>motor</b> <b>responses</b> differed markedly from those in adults because: (a) they exhibited higher thresholds; (b) they did not faithfully follow pulse trains delivered at 10 s intervals; (c) they had variable and longer latencies. Thereafter, <b>motor</b> <b>responses</b> gradually became stable, faithfully followed suprathreshold stimulation delivered at 0. 1 /s frequency, and acquired lower thresholds and shorter latencies, until they exhibited adult-like properties at 93 - 100 days of age. Single-unit recordings were obtained from 138 fibres isolated in the same callosal region submitted to microstimulation in order to study the response properties of the callosal fibres to somatic stimuli in immature animals. On the basis of their reactivity to peripheral stimulation, fibres were classified into three main types: (1) unreactive units (58 fibres), which could not be driven by somatic stimuli. (2) Adult-like units (55 fibres), which were readily driven by somatic stimuli and were endowed with fixed and small receptive fields (RFs) indistinguishable from those of adults. (3) Immature units (25 fibres), which were unsteadily driven by somatic stimuli applied over large areas at the periphery. Neither the RFs nor the adequate stimuli could be reliably determined. This type of units was not found in the adult cat (Spidalieri et al. 1985). The proportion of unreactive units was the highest before the appearance of <b>motor</b> <b>responses</b> and gradually decreased, approaching the adult level after attaining adult-like <b>motor</b> <b>responses.</b> Conversely, the proportion of adult-like units was lowest before the appearance of <b>motor</b> <b>responses</b> and gradually increased, approaching the adult level after <b>motor</b> <b>responses</b> had acquired adult-like properties...|$|R

2500|$|Although the {{simplest}} reflexes may be mediated by circuits lying entirely within the spinal cord, more complex responses rely on signal processing in the brain. For example, when {{an object in}} {{the periphery of the}} visual field moves, and a person looks toward it many stages of signal processing are initiated. [...] The initial sensory response, in the retina of the eye, and the final <b>motor</b> <b>response,</b> in the oculomotor nuclei of the brain stem, are not all that different from those in a simple reflex, but the intermediate stages are completely different. [...] Instead of a one or two step chain of processing, the visual signals pass through perhaps a dozen stages of integration, involving the thalamus, cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, superior colliculus, cerebellum, and several brainstem nuclei. [...] These areas perform signal-processing functions that include feature detection, perceptual analysis, memory recall, decision-making, and motor planning.|$|E
2500|$|If an {{individual}} experiences impaired or damaged cognitive inhibition abilities, the psychological {{results can be}} extremely debilitating. Patients with obsessive compulsive disorder can experience the effects of reduced cognitive inhibition. [...] "Failures of inhibition were identified in treatment of adults with OCD. In Go/No-Go tasks, subjects {{have to make a}} simple <b>motor</b> <b>response</b> (such as pressing a button) as quickly as possible when target stimuli are presented, and withhold the <b>motor</b> <b>response</b> when non-target stimuli are presented. Bannon et al. (2002) found that OCD patients made signiﬁcantly more commission errors than matched panic disorder control subjects in a computerized task necessitating the inhibition of responses on a proportion of trials— OCD patients tended to make inappropriate motor responses to non-target stimuli". Evidently, the cognitive inhibition that OCD patients experience can have such effects as impairing response time to significant stimuli and decreasing the ability to shut out irrelevant stimuli. This may be why OCD responses to certain stimuli can be difficult to control. Suicidal behavior may also be related to cognitive inhibition impairment. In one meta-analysis involving 164 studies, it was discovered that executive dysfunction and higher cognitive inhibition deficit is positively correlated and more frequently found among patients with suicidal behaviors. In attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), studies of cognitive control have not emphasized the ability to actively suppress pre-potent mental representations. This indicates that people diagnosed with ADHD experience an impaired cognitive inhibition ability and find it difficult to suppress irrelevant stimuli. The result is decreased mental representation control and perhaps a degree of working memory deficit. Finally, there are age-related effects on {{an individual}}'s ability to execute cognitive inhibition, which mostly include language impairment. [...] "In language production, older adults' increased word-finding deficits have been explained under inhibitory deficit theory as a consequence of their reduced ability to inhibit irrelevant words (competitors) that impair retrieval of the target". When speaking, many older adults experience difficulty [...] "finding" [...] the words they want to use, which is evidence of cognitive inhibition skills not functioning properly. Because they are not omitting synonyms or replacements entirely from their working memory (which can be considered irrelevant stimuli), they exhibit similar types of mental representation degradation that patients with depression, ADHD, or OCD indicate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{different}} types and administration techniques for anesthesia {{have been shown}} to affect cortical stimulation mapping. CSM can be done performed on awake patients, called an awake craniotomy or in patients who have been placed under general anesthesia. If the patient is under general anesthesia, the depth of the anesthesia can affect the outcome because if the levels of muscle relaxation are too high due to neuromuscular blocking drugs, then the results from the mapping can be incorrect. For the awake procedure there are different considerations for patient care that the anesthesiologist must take into account. Rather than simply ensuring that the patient is asleep, the doctor can follow what is called the asleep-awake-asleep technique. In this technique the patient is anesthetized using a general anesthesia during the opening and closing portions of the procedure, but during the interim the patient is maintained utilizing local anesthesia. The local anesthesia techniques can be either a local field block or a regional nerve block of the scalp. [...] The more common technique for the awake craniotomy is conscious sedation. In conscious sedation, the patient is only sedated during the opening and closing process, but never fully anesthetized, eliminating the need for breathing tubes, lessening the chances of complications, and lessening the chances of problems with <b>motor</b> <b>response.</b> Patients who undergo the procedure with an awake craniotomy instead of general anesthesia have better preservation of language function, a prediction of their seizure-free outcome based on corticography, a shorter hospitalization (which corresponds to a reduced cost of care), a decreased usage of invasive monitors, and decreased number of postoperative complications due to anesthesia such as nausea and vomiting.|$|E

Subjects were divided into 2 groups according to the timing of voluntary finger movements. It appeared that these movements occurred at relatively regular intervals of approximately 10 s in 5 subjects (group A); while 4 subjects showed random or very short inter-movement intervals (group B). Two remarkable results were obtained: first, the phase coupling (COH 2) between BP and RRI showed a significant (p = 0. 0061) interaction between activity (rest vs. movement) and group (A vs. B), with an increased (p = 0. 0003) coupling in group A. Second, the COH 2 between BP and Hb oscillations showed a significant (p = 0. 034) interaction between activity and group, with a decreased (p = 0. 079) coupling in group B. These results suggest that subjects able to initiate self-paced, voluntary movements at relatively regular intervals of ∼ 10 s show an entrainment potential between physiological oscillations and <b>motor</b> <b>responses.</b> This also provides the first evidence that not only physiological oscillations can be entrained to <b>motor</b> <b>responses,</b> but also <b>motor</b> <b>responses</b> (voluntary movements) can be entrained to slow intrinsic oscillations...|$|R
