As plans were being made to enter the studio to write and record its first album in nearly five years, the band postponed the recording because of the departure of bassist Jason Newsted. He left Metallica on January 17, 2001, stating his departure was due to [...] "private and personal reasons and the physical damage I have done to <b>myself</b> <b>over</b> the years while playing the music that I love." [...] Uncomfortable with immediately writing and recording with a new bassist, Metallica opted to include Bob Rock as bassist. The band stated they would find another bass player upon the album's completion.|$|E

During a Playboy interview with Metallica, Newsted {{said he wanted to}} release an album with his side project, Echobrain. Hetfield was opposed to the idea and said, [...] "When someone does a side project, it takes away from the strength of Metallica", and that a side project is [...] "like cheating on your wife in a way". Newsted said Hetfield had recorded vocals for a song used in the film , and appeared on two Corrosion of Conformity albums. Hetfield replied, [...] "My name isn't on those records. And I'm not out trying to sell them", and pondered questions such as, [...] "Where would it end? Does he start touring with it? Does he sell shirts? Is it his band?" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{book also}} found early success with book buyers {{and the general}} public. It sold 6,000 copies {{in its first year}} and 1,600 in its second. Frances Chrystie, the {{juvenile}} buyer for FAO Schwarz, wrote to Bennett Cerf, Geisel's publisher, [...] "I've been sitting alone in my apartment reading Horton aloud to <b>myself</b> <b>over</b> and over again... It's the funniest book I've ever seen... merchandise manager thinks he can find an elephant in the store, and we can make a tree and lay an egg and have a very fine window for Book Week." [...] Mary Stix of James Book Store in Cincinnati, Ohio, noted the book's popularity with adults as well as children. Numerous booksellers invited Geisel to hold autographing events at their stores, and Cerf sent him on a tour across several U.S. cities to promote the book. However, the book was less well received in England, where it was rejected by seven publishers before Hamish Hamilton finally published it, to modest success, in 1947. This mirrored a general trend, as Dr. Seuss books were slow to catch on in England.|$|E
500|$|In Olajuwon's {{college career}} and {{early years in}} the NBA, he was often undisciplined, talking back to officials, getting in minor fights with other players and {{amassing}} technical fouls. Later, Olajuwon took an active interest in spirituality, becoming a more devout Muslim. On March 9, 1991, he altered his name from Akeem to the more conventional spelling of Hakeem, saying, [...] "I'm not changing the spelling of my name, I'm correcting it". He later recalled, [...] "I studied the Qur'an every day. At home, at the mosque...I would read it in airplanes, before games and after them. I was soaking up the faith and learning new meanings each time I turned a page. I didn't dabble in the faith, I gave <b>myself</b> <b>over</b> to it." [...] "His religion dominates his life", Drexler said in 1995. Olajuwon was still {{recognized as one of}} the league's elite centers despite his strict observance of Ramadan (i.e., abstaining from food and drink during daylight hours for about a month), which occurred during the playing season throughout his career. Olajuwon was noted as sometimes playing better during the month, and in 1995 he was named NBA Player of the Month in February, even though Ramadan began on February 1 of that year.|$|E

When the other band members rejected Newsted's proposals, he chose to quit the band. On January 17, as plans were being made for the band to enter the recording studio to record its eighth studio album, Newsted announced his departure.

Does he sell shirts? Is it his band? Newsted's departure from Metallica, along with Hetfield's decision to go to rehab a few months later, almost led to a breakup of the band. After Hetfield rejoined Metallica, the band finished recording St. Anger, with record producer Bob Rock filling the bass slot. Robert Trujillo became the band's new bassist in 2003.|$|E
