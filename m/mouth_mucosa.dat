25|$|Fentanyl {{lozenges}} (Actiq) are a solid {{formulation of}} fentanyl citrate {{on a stick}} {{in the form of}} a lollipop that dissolves slowly in the mouth for transmucosal absorption. These lozenges are intended for opioid-tolerant individuals and are effective in treating breakthrough cancer pain. It has also been used for breakthrough pain for patients with nonmalignant (not cancer related) pain, but this application is controversial. The unit is a berry-flavoured lozenge on a stick swabbed on the mucosal surfaces inside the mouth—inside of the cheeks, under and on the tongue and gums—to release the fentanyl quickly into the system. It is most effective when the lozenge is consumed within 15 minutes. About 25 % of the drug is absorbed through the oral mucosa, resulting in a fast onset of action, and the rest is swallowed and absorbed in the small intestine, acting more slowly. The lozenge is less effective and acts more slowly if swallowed as a whole, as despite good absorbance from the small intestine there is extensive first-pass metabolism, leading to an oral bioavailability of about 33 % as opposed to 50 % when used correctly, (25 % via the <b>mouth</b> <b>mucosa</b> and 25 % via the gut).|$|E

30|$|The present {{work was}} carried out with {{following}} objectives: (1) facile synthesis and characterization of ZnO–CTS NPs with different stabilizers using nano spray drying and precipitation method. Various organic compounds, such as CA, glycerol, starch and whey powder, were used as capping agents to stabilize the NPs formulation and; (2) application of ZnO–CTS NPs as antimicrobial and antibiofilm forming agents against pathogenic microbial strains, e.g., Candida albicans, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus. These strains were selected due to their widespread occurrence and resulting health hazards. C. albicans is a causal agent of opportunistic oral and genital infections in humans [22]. Systemic fungal infections (fungemias) by C. albicans have emerged as major causes {{of morbidity and mortality}} in immuno-compromised patients. Candida albicans forms biofilms on the surface of implantable medical devices, as a consequence hospital-acquired infections by C. albicans have become a cause of major health concerns. Micrococcus luteus is a Gram-positive, spherical, saprotrophic bacterium that belongs to the family Micrococcaceae. Micrococcus luteus is found in soil, dust, water and air, and as part of the normal flora of the mammalian skin. It also colonizes the human <b>mouth,</b> <b>mucosae,</b> oropharynx and upper respiratory tract. Micrococcus luteus shows higher potential for biofilm formation. Staphylococcus aureus is a facultative anaerobic Gram-positive coccal pathogenic bacterium belonging to Staphylococcaceae family. Staphylococcus aureus is the prevalent cause of food intoxication and can cause a wide range of illnesses, from minor skin infections to life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, bacteremia and sepsis. It is one of the five most common causes of nosocomial infections and is often the cause of postsurgical wound infections [23].|$|R

DATA SOURCES: Medline database 1966 - 97 using the following subject headings and keywords: nicotine, absorption, <b>mouth</b> <b>mucosa,</b> skin, hydrogen-ion concentration, smokeless tobacco, biological transport, and membranes; computer database of the tobacco bibliography maintained by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Office on Smoking and Health; bibliographies of pertinent journal articles, books, and governmental reports; personal communications with experts in nicotine pharmacology and addiction; and Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation documents in the Tobacco Control Archives of the University of California, San Francisco. STUDY SELECTION: Included all relevant animal studies, in-vitro studies, nicotine replacement therapy trials, and human observational studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: We found {{that the effects of}} pH on drug absorption have been well established in animal models for nicotine and many other acidic or basic compounds. Increased alkalinity promotes the absorption of nicotine and increases its physiological effects. Human studies, which are more limited, confirm these processes. For example, nicotine absorption {{is directly related to the}} pH when nicotine is delivered in either tobacco smoke or nicotine polacrilex gum. CONCLUSIONS: Although other factors could influence the rate of nicotine absorption from oral tobacco, manipulating tobacco pH appears to be the primary means by which the speed of nicotine absorption is determined in moist-snuff products. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Acrylic resin {{as basic}} {{material}} for denture {{will stay on}} oral mucosa {{for a very long}} time. The polymerization of acrylic resin can be performed by conventional method and microwave, both produce different residual monomer at different toxicity. Acrylic resin can absorb solution, porous and possibly absorb disinfectantt as well, that may have toxic reaction with the tissue. Sodium Hypochlorite as removable denture disinfectant can be expected to be biocompatible to human body. The problem is how biocompatible acrylic resin which has been processed by conventional method and microwave method after being soaked in sodium hypochlorite solution. Purpose: The aim {{of this study was to}} understand in vitro biocompatibility of acrylic resin which has polimerated by conventional method and microwave after being soaked in sodium hypochlorite using tissue culture. Methods: Four groups of acrylic resin plate were produced, the first group was acrylic resin plate with microwave polymeration and soaked in sodium hypochlorite, the second group was acrylic resin plate with microwave polymeration but not soaked, the thirdwas one with conventional method and soaked and the last group was one with conventional method but not soaked, and in 1 control group. Each group consists of 7 plates. Biocompatibility test was performed in-vitro on each material using fibroblast tissue culture (BHK- 21 cell-line). Result: The percentage between living cells and dead cells from materials which was given acrylic plate was wounted. The data was analyzed statistically with T test.

RESULT: the most frequently found alterations in oral lichen planus were: an increase in the nucleus/cytoplasm relation (93. 33 %), nucleus membrane thickness (86. 67 %) and bi-nucleus or multinucleous (86. 67 %). The Student t test (alpha= 5 %) revealed a statistically significant difference between the average number of cell alterations in oral lichen planus (5. 87 ± 1. 57) and in epidermoid carcinoma (7. 60 ± 1. 81). As to the types of alterations, the chi-squared test also revealed statistically significant differences among the lesions assessed in relation to the following cell alterations: nuclear excess chromatism, atypical mitoses, cellular pleomorphism and abnormal cell differentiation (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that in some cases, some pathologists may make mistakes in the histopathological diagnosis of oral lichen planus, the results obtained in this study show that the alterations present in oral lichen planus differ considerably from those seen in epidermoid carcinoma, thus showing how distinct these two diseases are...|$|E
30|$|Oral submucous {{fibrosis}} is a {{precancerous lesion}} {{in the oral}} <b>mucosa.</b> <b>Mouth</b> opening limitation due to fibrous contracture is a major clinical feature. Abnormal sensation of oral mucosa is also an accompanying symptom of oral submucous fibrosis [46]. As chewing areca nut {{is reported to be}} a potential etiology, oral submucous fibrosis is prevalent in India [46 – 49] and Taiwan [50]. Complete cure for oral submucous fibrosis has barely been achieved [50]. Accordingly, functional restoration has been the main goal of the treatment.|$|R
40|$|Schwannoma is a {{relatively}} uncommon, slow-growing benign tumor that is derived apparently from the Schwann cells. The tongue {{is the most common}} site, followed by the palate, floor of <b>mouth,</b> buccal <b>mucosa,</b> lips, and jaws. It can present itself at any age. Usually, this lesion is not taken into account during clinical practice and the differential diagnosis includes numerous benign neoformations based on epithelial and connective tissues. Immunohistochemical features can be useful in determining the neural differentiation. Anti-S 100 protein is probably the most used antibody to identify this lesion. The schwannoma is usually a solitary lesion, and can be multiple when associated with neurofibromatosis. In the current study, authors report a case of an intraoral schwannoma situated at the vestibule with 20 years of evolution treated by complete surgical excision. The diagnosis was established based on clinical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical aspects. The patient is under clinical control, with no signs of recurrence even after four years...|$|R
40|$|Benign mucous {{membrane}} pemphigoid (MMP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic vesiculo-bullous eruptions, predominantly on {{mucous membrane}}s but occasionally on the skin. The diagnosis {{is hard to}} achieve due to similarity in clinical picture with other vesiculo-bullous lesions such as pemphigus or bullous pemphigoid, thereby, posing a diagnostic dilemma for the clinician. Histopathology can confirm the diagnosis; however, corticosteroids can be started to relieve the symptoms while confirmatory reports are not available as it is common treatment for most mucosal lesions. After histopathology report, if diagnosis of MMP is established, anti-leprotic drug can be started along with corticosteroids. We report a case of MMP in a 43 year-old female who presented with difficulty in eating and pain in her <b>mouth</b> (buccal <b>mucosa).</b> Skin lesions were also present on legs and shoulder. Oral mucosal lesions were managed with anti-leprotic drug (dapsone), and topical and systemic corticosteroids. Such approaches not only result in immediate relief of symptoms and improved clinical outcomes but also provide {{a better quality of}} life for patients...|$|R
