Fluorescence measurements on dibucaine in presence of phospholipid vesicles containing various amounts of cholesterol yielded a pattern of variation of wavelength at emission maximum and steady-state anisotropy which indicated that the microenvironment of dibucaine is more polar and flexible in membranes that contain cholesterol than in membranes without cholesterol. Experiments on quenching of fluorescence from membrane-associated dibucaine by potassium iodide showed a marked increase in quenching efficiency as the cholesterol content of the vesicles was increased, demonstrating increased accessibility of the iodide quenchers to dibucaine {{in the presence of}} cholesterol, when compared to that in its absence. Total emission intensity decay profiles of dibucaine yielded two lifetime components of ∼ 1 ns and ∼ 2. 8 – 3. 1 ns with mean relative contributions of ∼ 25 and ∼ 75 %, respectively. The mean lifetime in vesicles was 20 – 30 % smaller than in the aqueous medium and showed a moderate variation with cholesterol content. Fluorescence measurements at two different temperatures in DMPC SUVs, one at 33 °C, above the phase transition temperature and another at 25 °C, around the main phase transition, indicated two different mode of dibucaine localization. At 25 °C dibucaine partitioned differentially in presence and absence of cholesterol. However, at 33 °C the apparent partition coefficients remained unaltered indicating differences in the microenvironment of dibucaine in presence and absence of cholesterol in the phospholipid membranes...|$|R

The condensing heat transfer coefficients were obtained by means of the Wilson graphical method as modified by Beatty and Katz. Data secured for this method of obtaining condensing heat transfer coefficients were overall heat transfer coefficients at a series of cooling water velocities for constant condenser temperature, constant methane concentration in the vapor, and an average cooling water temperature that varied within the narrow range 82 to 84 F.

Diffusion couples of vitreous materials were prepared and annealed. Best success in preparation was achieved by using electron-bombardment heating in vacuum to melt the less refractory glass and let it solidify around {{some of the more}} refractory material. Annealing was done with the protection of flowing argon at about 885 ° C for times up to 350. 3 hours. Diffusion profiles were measured by neutron-induced autoradiography, but before this could be done, it was necessary to establish practical conditions for using the technique, and to calibrate it for lithia-silica compositions. This was the first known application of its sort for the method of neutron-induced autoradiography, and problems were encountered. This work represents a basis for improving several technical aspects. Results of the work completed can be considered only tentative, but it is believed that evidence of a liquid-liquid miscibility gap was observed for the lithia-silica compositions studied.

Addition of cholesterol therefore has opposite effects on the hydrocarbon and polar regions of membranes: although cholesterol makes the hydrocarbon region gel-like, with an increased probability of trans conformations, the conformation of the polar head groups is very similar to that found in the liquid crystalline phase of pure phospholipid bilayers...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePristine and co-doped ZnO with doping of Cu and Al nano {{particles}} {{have been}} successfully synthesized by chemical co-precipitation method without using any capping agent and annealed in air ambient at 500 0 C for one hour. Here, the Al concentration is fixed at 5 <b>mol</b> <b>percent</b> and copper concentration is increasing from 1 to 5 <b>mol</b> <b>percent.</b> The Crystallanity, structure and crystallite size of pure and co-doped ZnO nano particles are determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in range from 20 0 to 80 0. XRD pattern reveals that the samples possess hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO and the estimated particle size of pure and co-doped ZnO nano particles is 20 - 22 nm. Morphological and compositional analysis is done by SEM and EDS. Photoluminescence studies reveals the origin of PL emission in the visible region. PL spectrum shows the blue emission peaks appeared at 435, 448 and 468 nm and green emission peak at 536 nm. Introduction. ZnO is a promising (II-V) semi conductor with wide direct band gap (3. 32 eV) and large binding energy (60 MeV). It have attracted {{a lot of attention}} due to its significant properties such as room temperature luminescence, good transparency and high electron mobility. Also, it has practical applications in various fields such as solar cells, light emitting diodes, gas sensors, etc. Preferentially ZnO is in the hexagonal wurtzite structure[1 - 3]. Electronic structure, optical and electrical properties of the host lattice ZnO can be varied by adding of different type of metal ions such as Ca, Al, Mg, Ni and Fe[4 - 10]. The magnetic properties of ZnO also tuned by doping of metal ions such as Co, N, Ru and Cu[11 - 13]. There are different methods for the synthesis of ZnO nano particles such as solution combustion method [14], vapor phase oxidation[15], chemical vapor deposition, sol-gel[16], chemical co-precipitation method[17 - 19]. Among these methods chemical co-precipitation method is used for the preparation of large quantity of pure and doped ZnO nano particles because it is simple, cost effective and high yield rate. The structural, compositional and optical properties of the synthesized nano particles are presented...|$|E
40|$|The solid {{inner core}} of the Earth is {{predominantly}} composed of iron alloyed with several percent Ni and some lighter elements, Si, S, O, H, and C being the prime candidates. There have been {{a growing number of}} papers investigating C and H as possible light elements in the core, but the results are contradictory. Here, using ab initio simulations, we study the Fe-C and Fe-H systems at inner core pressures (330 - 364 GPa). Using the evolutionary structure prediction algorithm USPEX, we have determined the lowest-enthalpy structures of possible carbides (FeC, Fe 2 C, Fe 3 C, Fe 4 C, FeC 2, FeC 3, FeC 4 and Fe 7 C 3) and hydrides (Fe 4 H, Fe 3 H, Fe 2 H, FeH, FeH 2, FeH 3, FeH 4) and have found that Fe 2 C (Pnma) is the most stable iron carbide at pressures of the inner core, while FeH, FeH 3 and FeH 4 are stable iron hydrides at these conditions. For Fe 3 C, the cementite structure (Pnma) and the Cmcm structure recently found by random sampling are less stable than the I- 4 and C 2 /m structures found here. We found that FeH 3 and FeH 4 adopt chemically interesting thermodynamically stable structures, in both compounds containing trivalent iron. The density of the inner core can be matched with a reasonable concentration of carbon, 11 - 15 <b>mol.</b> <b>percent</b> (2. 6 - 3. 7 wt. percent) at relevant pressures and temperatures. This concentration matches that in CI carbonaceous chondrites and corresponds to the average atomic mass in the range 49. 3 - 51. 0, in close agreement with inferences from the Birch's law for the inner core. Similarly made estimates for the maximum hydrogen content are unrealistically high, 17 - 22 <b>mol.</b> <b>percent</b> (0. 4 - 0. 5 wt. percent), which corresponds to the average atomic mass in the range 43. 8 - 46. 5. We conclude that carbon is a better candidate light alloying element than hydrogen.

40|$|Nitrogen {{and noble}} gases are {{important}} tracers in geochemistry and chosmochemistry. Compared to noble gases, however, physicochemical properties of nitrogen, such as solubility in melt or melt/silicate partition, {{are not well}} known. Solubility of nitrogen in basalt melt depends on redox condition of the atmosphere. For example, solubility of nitrogen in E chondrite melt under reducing conditions {{is as high as}} 2 <b>mol</b> <b>percent</b> at 1500 C, suggesting that nitrogen is chemically dissolved in silicate melts, i. e., being dissolved as free anions or replacing oxygen sites in silicate network. However, the solubility and the dissolution mechanism of nitrogen under oxidizing conditions are not well investigated. To obtain nitrogen solubility in silicate melts under various redox conditions and to understand its mechanism, we are conducting experiments by using (15) N(15) N-labeled nitrogen gas. This makes it easy to distinguish dissolved nitrogen from later contamination of atmospheric nitrogen, and hence enables us to measure the nitrogen solubility accurately. As a preliminary experiment, we have measured solubility of nitrogen in basalt melt under the atmospheric oxygen pressure...|$|E
