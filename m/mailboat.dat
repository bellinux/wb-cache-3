He had volunteered, and been accepted, for medical {{service in the}} Cuban War of Independence. The <b>mailboat</b> left on September 3 and arrived in Barcelona, which was under martial law, on October 3, 1896. After a brief confinement at Montjuich prison, Rizal was told by Captain-General Eulogio Despujol {{that he would not}} be going on to Cuba, but would be sent back to the Philippines instead. Upon his return, he was imprisoned in Fort Santiago.|$|E
25|$|Six {{islands are}} {{connected}} to the mainland by bridges (Black Cat, Governors, Long, Oak, Christmas (or Plummers) in Paugus Bay, and Worcester), and another eight (Bear, Birch, Cow, East Bear, Jolly, Loon, Three Mile, and Sandy) are served by the U.S. <b>mailboat</b> M/V Sophie C.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, he {{launched}} Margaritaville Records, with distribution through MCA Records. His MCA record deal {{ended with the}} release of 1996's Christmas Island and he took Margaritaville Records over to Chris Blackwell's Island Records for a two-record deal, 1998's Don't Stop The Carnival and 1999's Beach House on the Moon. In the fall of 1999, he started up <b>Mailboat</b> Records to release live albums. He entered into a partnership with RCA Records for distribution in 2005 and 2006 for the two studio albums License To Chill and Take The Weather With You.|$|E

5000|$|Built in 1947, Loch Seaforth was {{the delayed}} {{second of two}} <b>mailboats</b> ordered in 1938; the first, [...] had entered service in 1939. Larger and faster than her predecessors, she rapidly became a success at Stornoway.|$|R
2500|$|Andros is {{connected}} to Nassau by Sea-Link ferry, which runs daily to Morgan's Bluff on {{the north end of}} the island and Fresh Creek in central Andros. It is also reachable by <b>mailboat</b> from Nassau and for inter-island travel with stops at numerous Andros settlements.|$|E
2500|$|On September 21, 2011, <b>Mailboat</b> Records {{released}} , a double-CD telling Mark Twain's life in {{spoken word}} and song, {{including a new}} song by Paisley titled [...] "Huck Finn Blues". Paisley's website {{announced that he was}} a fan of Twain, prompting his collaboration on the project with Clint Eastwood, Jimmy Buffett, Sheryl Crow, Vince Gill, and others.|$|E
2500|$|Buffett partnered in a {{duet with}} the Zac Brown Band on the song [...] "Knee Deep": {{released}} on Brown's 2010 album You Get What You Give, it became a hit country and pop single in 2011. Also in 2011, Buffett voiced Huckleberry Finn on , which was released on <b>Mailboat</b> Records. The project is {{a benefit for the}} Mark Twain Boyhood Home & Museum and includes Clint Eastwood as Mark Twain, Garrison Keillor as the narrator, and songs by Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, Ricky Skaggs, Vince Gill, Emmylou Harris, and others.|$|E
5000|$|Lochiel was {{the first}} of two <b>mailboats</b> ordered in 1938; the second, [...] was delayed until 1947. Built in 1939, she was the fourth MacBrayne's vessel named Lochiel. The earlier Lochiels had been {{single-screw}} steamers, two serving Islay.|$|R

60|$|The skipper was {{understood}} {{to say that}} his ship was not a several adjectived hospital, but Austin only smiled, for he was acquainted {{with that kind of}} man, and aware that he was, at least, as likely to do him a kindness as an elaborately got up <b>mailboat's</b> skipper.|$|R
2500|$|On September 21, 2012, <b>Mailboat</b> Records {{released}} , an Americana double-CD {{that tells}} the life of fellow Missourian Mark Twain in spoken word and song. The project was {{a benefit for the}} Mark Twain Boyhood Home & Museum in Hannibal, Missouri. Crow sang the only period piece song on the project, Stephen Foster's [...] "Beautiful Dreamer." [...] The song was sung a cappella and accompanied the narrative describing the early days of Mark Twain's young family in Hartford, Connecticut. Other performers that joined the project, produced by Carl Jackson, included Jimmy Buffett, Clint Eastwood, Garrison Keillor, Brad Paisley, Emmylou Harris, Vince Gill, Ricky Skaggs, and others. AirPlay Direct reported the project as its most downloaded Americana album.|$|E

50|$|Ferries (boats) provide water {{travel around}} Nassau to the {{surrounding}} islands, namely Paradise Island. Prince George Wharf is the main port {{in the city that}} serves cruise ships with ports of call in Nassau. Transportation and shipping around the Family Islands is primarily through <b>mailboats</b> based at Potters Cay. International shipping is done through the Arawak Port Department on Arawak Cay. High speed excursions to Exuma, Spanish Wells and Harbour Island are available daily.|$|R
60|$|Austin {{thanked him}} profusely, {{and felt a}} good deal easier when he and the <b>mailboat's</b> doctor, who arrived {{presently}} and gave him good advice, went away. Then, with a blast of her whistle, the Cumbria steamed on to the West again, and it was {{three or four days}} later, and she was plunging along with dripping forecastle at a little over six knots against the trades, when Austin had trouble with Jefferson. He was asleep in his room, aft, and, awakening suddenly, wondered {{for a moment or two}} what was wrong, until it dawned on him that it was the unusual quietness which had roused him. Then he sprang from his berth and hastened out on deck, for it was evident that the engines had stopped.|$|R
60|$|They {{left the}} hotel and shortly {{afterwards}} reached the mole, which sheltered the shallow harbor where the cargo lighters were unloaded. The long, smooth swell broke in flashes of green and gold phosphorescence against the concrete wall, and the moon threw a broad, glittering track across the sea. There was a rattle of cranes and winches and a noisy tug was towing a row of barges towards the land. The measured thud of her engines broke through the splash of water flung off the lighters' bows as they lurched across the swell, and somebody on board was singing a Spanish song. Farther out, a <b>mailboat's</b> gently swaying hull blazed with electric light, and astern of her the reflection of a tramp steamer's cargo lamp quivered upon the sea. By and by, Dick, who ascertained that Fuller had not landed, hailed a steam launch, which came panting towards some steps.|$|R
6000|$|... "If the port-guard saw us, he'd reckon we {{meant to}} board the <b>mailboat,</b> but it's {{possible}} he didn't pick us out from the others," [...] Wyndham remarked. [...] "Well, the breeze is freshening. Let's put up the mast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To the town. I don't {{expect him}} until he calls for his man--the one I've just hove out--when the West-coast <b>mailboat</b> comes in. She won't stop {{more than half an}} hour, but there's no sign of her yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{nothing that}} quite fits the thing here, {{and from what}} the West-coast <b>mailboat</b> men told me, craw-craw must be different," [...] he said. [...] "In the meanwhile, it wouldn't do any harm to soak myself in black coffee." ...|$|E
60|$|It was a sunny {{afternoon}} {{when the little}} West Coast <b>mailboat's</b> engines ceased their throbbing off the mole of Santa Cruz, Teneriffe. Clear skies had hung over her as she rolled northward in no great hurry, and the fresh breezes which curl the sparkling sea between Morocco and the fever coast had brought new life to her sickly passengers. Dane felt his heart grow lighter as each league of deep blue water rolled astern, and {{the shadow of the}} dark land had almost fallen from him when the Canaries rose out of the sea. He had youth on his side, besides a comparatively clean conscience and a sound constitution; and a little chest consigned by him to a British bank was locked in the steamer's specie room. Though he would gladly have flung its contents into the sea to undo the past, regrets were futile. So, with a courage which sprang rather from humility than pride, he had determined to ask Lilian Chatterton to either share his struggles or await his prosperity.|$|R
5000|$|Jennings {{continued}} to sail for the wrecks in Florida after his raids on the French, stopping ships such as Spanish <b>mailboats</b> along the way. In April 1716, the Spanish salvagers {{had left the}} site of Jennings' first two attacks, and Jennings returned again to the site, this time leading efforts to recover more sunken treasure. After political pressure, Hamilton issued proclamations in April 1716 forbidding all commissioned vessels in Jamaica from fishing the Florida wrecks for plunder. It {{was one of his}} last acts as governor before Hamilton was himself arrested, and overall he declared all passes issued to treasure hunters null and void, meaning that henceforth, any captain attacking Spanish forts or vessels in peacetime was a pirate. [...] On his third trip to the wrecks, Jennings intercepted a Spanish vessel as it returned from the salvage site, and reappeared off Port Royal with 30,000 pieces of eight he’d forcibly taken from the Spanish vessel. Hamilton made it clear that Jennings would be arrested if the Bersheba entered Kingston harbor, and the sloop and the cargo impounded. Jennings and his crew chose to sail away with their cargo.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] {{said the}} other lady, with caressing intelligence. [...] "That is just the way with--" [...] She stopped, {{and looked at the}} young man whom the head steward was {{bringing}} up to take the vacant place next to March. He came forward, stuffing his cap {{into the pocket of his}} blue serge sack, and smiled down on the company with such happiness in his gay eyes that March wondered what chance at this late day could have given any human creature his content so absolute, and what calamity could be lurking round the corner to take it out of him. The new-comer looked at March as if he knew him, and March saw at a second glance that he was the young fellow who had told him about the mother put off after the start. He asked him whether there was any change in the weather yet outside, and he answered eagerly, as if the chance to put his happiness into the mere sound of words were a favor done him, that their ship had just spoken one of the big Hanseatic <b>mailboats,</b> and she had signalled back that she had met ice; so that they would probably keep a southerly course, and not have it cooler till they were off the Banks.|$|R
60|$|Eyes, pale {{as the sea}} {{the wind}} had freshened, paler, firm and prudent. The seas' ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the <b>mailboat</b> vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy moodily {{returned}} to his duty. He thought his fault was small, {{but there was no}} appeal. He would have no further opportunity for serving his present employers; and <b>mailboat</b> berths are not readily picked up. He kept his watch, and afterward went to sleep with a heavy heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "My husband must {{certainly}} know at once, {{but it is}} twenty odd miles to Oratava alone, and several more {{from there to the}} sugar-mill," [...] she said. [...] "The telegraph office is closed, and you say the <b>mailboat</b> should sail early to-morrow. It is very unfortunate, but what can we do?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Completed in October, trials soon {{showed that}} she was too slow. Castalia was {{returned}} to her makers for new boilers and paddles to be fitted. A debenture of £16,000 being sought by the English Channel Steamship Company to finance the improvements. On her delivery voyage from Gravesend, Kent to Dover on 15 September 1874, trouble was experienced with priming of her boilers, necessitating a reduction to half-power, although a speed of [...] was attained. On arrival at Dover, large crowds {{came to see the}} novel ship. Castalia made a trial run between Dover and Calais on 21 July 1875. The voyage had begun at Gravesend with the intention that she would sail to Calais, but the Board of Trade inspector on board ordered her into Dover as she approached the North Foreland. A protruding bolt on the Admiralty Pier at Dover caused some minor damage, which was quickly repaired. Although her steering gear had failed, there was no difficulty in manoeuvering the ship, attributed {{to the fact that the}} engines drove each paddle wheel independently. Castalia then made the crossing to Calais. She made a public trial crossing of the Channel on 2 August. The Times commented {{that she was}} underpowered, having [...] for a gross register tonnage of 1,533. <b>Mailboats</b> then in service had [...] for a tonnage of [...]|$|R
6000|$|... "Hallo! Here's Elliot," [...] he exclaimed. [...] "S'pose he {{came across}} on the <b>mailboat.</b> I heard her whistle not long since. Thought {{he was going to}} stop and see if they could salve Deva. Anyhow, I'd like to hear about the {{collision}} and it looks as if he was making for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] I said. [...] "It's {{getting so}} desperate that I had {{thought for a}} moment, since we can't make our way south, whether I wouldn't try to steer west and make an attempt to reach the <b>mailboat</b> track. We could always get some quinine from her, at least. What do you think?" ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{towards the}} end of the {{afternoon}} when the skipper of the West-coast <b>mailboat,</b> peering through his glasses, made out two palms that rose apparently straight out of the sea. He watched them for some minutes, and then took their bearing carefully upon the compass, before he rang for half speed and called Austin to the bridge.|$|E
60|$|Aynsley {{saw that}} she was on her guard. Girls, he understood, often had a {{partiality}} for <b>mailboat</b> officers who were generally men of prepossessing appearance and manners. However, he kept his thoughts to himself, for he was usually diffident with Ruth. Although he had long admired her, he knew that he would not gain anything by an attempt to press his suit.|$|E
60|$|Austin {{drew the}} lanyard, {{and when the}} ensign blew out on the hot air Union down, the <b>mailboat</b> stopped, and, {{considering}} that they were steamboat men, her crew had a white gig over in a very creditable time. She came flying towards the Cumbria with four negroes at the oars, and when she slid alongside a young mate in trim white uniform came up a rope.|$|E
6000|$|... "After all," [...] said Ellams, [...] "there was no {{theatrical}} climax. One day {{a launch}} brought us a cablegram. Wyndham was wanted at home, the ebb tide was running and a <b>mailboat</b> {{was due to}} call at Takana lagoon. In an hour Columbine dropped down stream and my notion is {{it was a relief}} to Wyndham the cablegram arrived. If it had not arrived, he would have stayed. He was that kind of man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “That’s {{what they}} seemed to be doing, but I’ve had my suspicions about it since. If they caught anything, it would be a long way from a market, and, though they were dirty and ragged enough, two of them hadn’t the look of regular fishermen. One rather amusing fellow was very much of the kind you’d meet at a {{sporting}} club, and the other had the stamp of a navy or first-class <b>mailboat</b> man. He was English.” ...|$|E
60|$|It was, however, {{rather more}} than three weeks later when, as a yellow-funnelled <b>mailboat</b> slid into Las Palmas harbour, Austin, leaning down from her rail, saw Jacinta and Mrs. Hatherly in one of the {{crowding}} boats below. The little lady discreetly remained where she was, and when Jacinta came up the ladder Austin met her at the head of it. She flashed a swift glance into his face, and then for a moment turned hers aside.|$|E
