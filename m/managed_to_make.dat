5|$|By {{the terms}} of his parole, Mallory was not {{permitted}} to hold public office, so he made a living by reopening his old law practice. Nominally excluded from politics, he <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his views known by writing letters and editorials for Florida newspapers. At first he urged acceptance of the reconstituted Union and acquiescence in the policies of Reconstruction, but he soon came out in opposition, particularly against black suffrage.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 25 March, the prisoners enacted their plan. Serious {{problems}} arose immediately. The tunnel hatch proved difficult to open and the tunnel exit was several metres short of the relatively safe forested area. These problems led to delays and only 76 POWs <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their break for freedom. As originally intended, Marcinkus {{was one of the}} first ten to escape.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 18th century, Charles Messier {{compiled}} a catalog containing the 109 brightest celestial objects having nebulous appearance. Subsequently, William Herschel assembled a catalog of 5,000 nebulae. In 1845, Lord Rosse constructed a new telescope and was able to distinguish between elliptical and spiral nebulae. He also <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> out individual point sources in some of these nebulae, lending credence to Kant's earlier conjecture.|$|E

5|$|According to Bradman, Fingleton and O'Reilly, Lindwall's {{performance}} in the final Test at The Oval {{was one of the}} best they had ever seen from any player. English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, surprising most observers. The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the players to keep their grip. Along with the rain, humidity assisted the bowlers, particularly Lindwall, who <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of systems that developed, only one {{tropical}} cyclone, the second hurricane, <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> landfall during the season. It severely impacted areas of the Greater Antilles, particularly the Dominican Republic, before making subsequent landfalls on Cuba and the U.S. states of Florida and North Carolina, with less severe effects. The estimated 2,000 to 8,000deaths caused by the storm in the Dominican Republic alone ranked it as one of the deadliest Atlantic hurricanes in recorded history. No other storms affected any landmasses during the year, although the first storm damaged a cruise ship in open waters.|$|E
5|$|Geißhardt, who {{was flying}} Fw 190 A-4 (Werknummer 7051—factory number) in Priller's Schwarm, was {{severely}} wounded in combat with United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-17 Flying Fortress of the 306th Bomb Group on 5 April 1943. He {{had been hit}} by the defensive fire from the bombers. He was bleeding profusely from an abdominal wound but <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a smooth landing on the airfield at Sint-Denijs-Westrem, Belgium. He succumbed to his injuries early the next morning on 6 April 1943.|$|E

5|$|Group C was {{the only}} group without a Korean team seeded first. Its two qualifiers were both {{considered}} championship favorites, since H2K-Gaming was a strong European team and EDward Gaming was a strong Chinese team. Despite a 1–2 showing in the first week, H2K <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the quarterfinals {{at the top of}} its group by winning four straight matches, including a tiebreaker against EDward Gaming, to become the only European team to move on.|$|E
5|$|In June 2002, when Jiang Zemin visited Iceland, Icelandic {{authorities}} {{complied with}} requests from the Chinese government to deny entry to Falun Gong practitioners {{who sought to}} enter the country to protest. Using a blacklist provided by China, hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners were turned away by the national airline or detained if they <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it to the country. The blacklisting ignited protests by Icelandic citizens and members of parliament. In 2011, Iceland's foreign minister Össur Skarphéðinsson issued an apology for violating Falun Gong practitioners' freedom of expression and movement.|$|E
5|$|Keith Richards as Edward Teague: Keeper of the Pirata Codex for the Brethren Court and Jack Sparrow's father. The other pirate lords are visibly {{terrified of}} him. Richards, who {{partially}} inspired Depp's portrayal of Sparrow, {{was meant to}} appear in Dead Man's Chest, {{but there was no}} room for him in the story, as well as his being tied up with a Rolling Stones tour. He almost missed filming a scene in At World's End, following injuries sustained by falling out of a tree. In June 2006, Verbinski finally <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> room in Richards' schedule to shoot that September.|$|E

5|$|Montfort's {{support was}} now dwindling, and Edward retook Worcester and Gloucester with {{relatively}} little effort. Meanwhile, Montfort {{had made an}} alliance with Llywelyn and started moving east to join forces with his son Simon. Edward <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a surprise attack at Kenilworth Castle, where the younger Montfort was quartered, {{before moving on to}} cut off the earl of Leicester. The two forces then met at the second great encounter of the Barons' War, the Battle of Evesham, on 4August 1265. Montfort stood little chance against the superior royal forces, and after his defeat he was killed and mutilated on the field.|$|E
5|$|When fit, Gibbs {{had been}} Watford's first choice right-back since 1985, with the {{exception}} of 1994–95, where Gerard Lavin's form kept a recovering Gibbs in the reserves. A combination of Gibbs' age, and a desire to acquire more strength in depth for the Premier League, prompted Taylor to sign right-backs Des Lyttle and Neil Cox in 1999. Despite the competition, Gibbs <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> 20 appearances in 1999–2000, and his Premier League experience included victories over Chelsea, Coventry City and Southampton, although these were not enough to prevent relegation back to the First Division.|$|E
5|$|After France surrendered, Marcinkus <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{his way to}} the French {{colonies in}} Africa (Morocco and Algeria). He decided to go to Great Britain and {{continue}} fighting, but the French army's terms of armistice at Compiègne and tensions between Britain and France made this difficult. On 12 August 1940 he was finally demobilized from the French army. Marcinkus and some of his associates concocted a daring plan to commandeer several aircraft without authorization and fly to England. The plan was not executed due to increased security at airfields and other circumstances. He finally received the necessary documents enabling him to go to Britain in autumn of 1940.|$|E

5|$|As {{the wine}} {{business}} began to prosper, Schnaufer also gave thought to alternative employment possibilities in peacetime aviation. With his wartime friend Hermann Greiner, he traveled from Weil am Rhein to Bern in Switzerland to meet South American diplomats; the two {{hoped to find}} employment as pilots in South America. To get to Bern, they crossed the Swiss-German border illegally. The meeting was a failure. As they returned to Germany, they were caught by Swiss border guards attempting to make a second illegal border crossing. The Swiss handed {{them over to the}} French occupation authorities and they were imprisoned in Lörrach, where they remained until Schnaufer <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> contact with a French general, who was a customer of the Schnaufer winery and had them released. This misadventure kept him away from his business for about half a year.|$|E
5|$|During {{the week}} of 22 May, United had a bye week from league play, which allowed the club to {{schedule}} a home friendly against the defending Dutch champions, AFC Ajax of Amsterdam. The previous week, Ajax had tallied a 3–1 win over Twente to secure the Dutch title for an unprecedented 30th time, their first since 2004. The Amsterdamers notched an early strike in the 10th minute thanks to forward, and Serbian international, Miralem Sulejmani. The Black-and-Red <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up for the early setback thanks to a 58th-minute cross from Ngwenya to newly drafted Blake Brettschneider, leveling the match at one apiece. However, the match ended in Ajax's favor over United as the Amsterdammers tallied a final goal in the 87th minute courtesy of midfielder Vurnon Anita.|$|E
5|$|Forest Hill {{was a new}} air base, {{and roads}} and {{buildings}} were still under construction when its first course of flying training commenced with Avro Ansons on 29July 1940. One of the Ansons crashed in August, killing its instructor and a student. Later that month the second flying course began, on CAC Wirraways. The school was then reorganised into Initial and Advanced Squadrons. On 29September, two Ansons collided in mid-air and became locked together. Both navigators bailed out, to be followed shortly afterwards by the injured pilot of the lower aircraft. The pilot of the upper Anson, however, {{found that he was}} able to control the interlocked aircraft using his ailerons and flaps, coupled with the engine power of the Anson underneath. He then <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a successful emergency landing in a paddock near the town of Brocklesby.|$|E

5|$|Laird {{began his}} {{football}} {{career as a}} trainee at Plymouth Argyle, progressing through the club's centre of excellence. He spent a total of eight years on the club's books, but only <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> one first–team appearance for the club. In 2006, he was loaned out to Tiverton Town, playing a total of 20 games for the club, scoring four times. He was later loaned to Torquay United in September 2007, making two appearances for the side. Another loan spell followed, this time to Stevenage in late 2007. Laird impressed under manager Peter Taylor and signed on a permanent basis {{at the start of}} February 2008 for an undisclosed fee.|$|E
5|$|Schlachtgeschwader 4 and Jagdgeschwader 2 (SG 4 and JG 2) were {{to strike}} at Sint-Truiden airfield. JG 2 was {{commanded}} by Kurt Bühligen. I./JG 2's ground crews <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> ready 35 of 46 Fw 190s, 29 of which were Fw 190D. Only 33 pilots were fit for operations. So the Gruppe reported only 33 Fw 190s ready. II./JG 2 could field 20 of 29 Bf 109s. Stab./JG 2 had three Fw 190s ready for the mission. It {{is not clear whether}} Bühligen took part in the mission. III./JG 2 reported 40 Fw 190s operational, 34 of them Fw 190Ds. However, only 28 of the 43 pilots in the unit were fit for operations and the formation fielded only 28 fighters. In total, 84 aircraft were ready on 31 December, including 28 Fw 190D-9s.|$|E

Immediately after the surrender of Port Arthur, Sevastopol was scuttled to prevent her capture by the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Japanese never raised her.
