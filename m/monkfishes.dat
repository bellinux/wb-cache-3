40|$|Summary. This {{developmental}} project involves {{design and}} {{test of a}} <b>monkfish</b> grid to reduce juvenile <b>monkfish</b> catch in the trawls targeting <b>monkfish</b> and other groundfish species in the Gulf of Maine. Excessive undersize <b>monkfish</b> catch and subsequent discard in trawls {{is contrary to the}} sustainable exploitation of the resource. A Nordmore grid-style device will be tested to exclude small <b>monkfish</b> passing through a 90 mm spacing grid. Successful result of use this or similar grid will lead to comprehensive test in trawls targeting for <b>monkfish</b> (the large mesh sector). The grid design utilizes information obtained from a previous research on grids for separating fish species and sizes. The preliminary grid will be 90 mm grid spacing and installed at 48 to 60 degrees. The alternating tow method will be used to evaluate the design in terms of juvenile <b>monkfish</b> reduction, retention of legal size <b>monkfish</b> and other commercial groundfish species, and operational aspects for handling the grid with existing deck equipment.

40|$|The use of fish {{closures}} as {{a management}} tool to protect juvenile fish habitat and adult spawning grounds {{has become increasingly}} popular, although knowledge of the direct effects of marine closures on juvenile fish populations is limited. Given that <b>monkfish</b> land-ings account for a considerable percentage of the monetary value derived from the groundfish fishery in new England, investigating {{the factors that influence}} <b>monkfish</b> population dynamics will assist managers in sustaining this important natural resource. We conducted bottom-trawl surveys {{to determine the effects of}} closure status [inside vs. outside the Western Gulf of Maine Closure Area (WGMCA) ] and habitat type (mud bottom in isolation from gravel or cobble bottom vs. mud that is next to these more complex habitats) on the distribution, abundance, and diet composition of <b>monkfish</b> (Lophius americanus) in the Gulf of Maine. Surprisingly, the abundance of adult <b>monkfish</b> did not differ in vs. out of the closure, and juvenile <b>monkfish</b> were more abundant outside of the WGMCA, where they also exhibited higher feeding intensity and consumed more prey biomass. <b>Monkfish</b> diet and condition results implied that the boulder and ledge bottom is essential <b>monkfish</b> habitat and that these effects were independent of the WGMCA...|$|R

40|$|The American <b>monkfish,</b> Lophius americanus, {{supports}} important {{commercial fisheries}} in the Northwest Atlantic. Although life history {{information is available}} for smaller L. americanus, the biology of large <b>monkfish</b> (. 70 cm) is poorly understood because relatively few large fish are caught in standard resource surveys. Between 2006 and 2008, 699 L. americanus of 71 – 118 cm total length were collected from commercial gillnet fishers operating in the mid-Atlantic Bight (n = 689) and in the Gulf of Maine (n = 10) to investigate growth rates, reproductive biology, and feeding habits of large <b>monkfish.</b> All those collected were mature females {{ranging in age from}} 7 to 13 years. Growth was linear at an average annual rate of 7. 6 cm. Hepatosomatic indices peaked in February and gonadosomatic indices between February and April. Postovulatory follicles and vitellogenic oocytes were observed in the same ovaries, evidence that <b>monkfish</b> spawn over a protracted period and possibly more than once annually. Food habits were similar to those reported for smaller benthic phase <b>monkfish,</b> but cannibalism was more prevalent in large fish (5. 6 % frequency of occurrence). Frequencies of feeding and canni-balism were greatest in females in the final stage of oocyte maturation...|$|R
40|$|Two <b>monkfish</b> {{species are}} caught {{off the coast}} of Namibia. These are Lophius vomerinus Valenciennes (1837) and L. vaillanti Regan (1903). L. vomerinus is the more {{abundant}} of the two and contributes approximately 99 % to the total Namibian <b>monkfish</b> landings. The Namibian <b>monkfish</b> fishery {{is one of the largest}} and most valuable of its kind in the world. Two fishing fleets harvest the resource, viz. the <b>monkfish</b> and sole fleet and the hake directed fleet. In 1998 and 1999, <b>monkfish</b> were also harvested by one gillnet vessel that had an experimental right. In this study, the biology, abundance and exploitation patterns of <b>monkfish</b> were investigated and used as inputs into a stock assessment framework as a contribution towards the development of a management procedure for this species. Ground and sectioned otoliths and sectioned illicia were used to age Lophius vomerinus. The illicia provided more precise estimates of age, and growth was subsequently modelled using these age estimates. Growth in length and weight was best described by the threeparameter specialised von Bertalanffy model as Lt (cm TL) = 72. 29 (1 -e⁻°·¹⁴⁽t⁺°·³°⁾) and Wt (kg) = 3. 96 (1 -e⁻°·¹⁸⁽t⁺°·¹°⁾) ²·⁹⁹ for males, and Lt (cm TL) = 111. 98 (1 -e⁻°·°⁸⁽t⁺°·³⁶⁾) and Wt (kg) = 6. 92 (1 -e⁻°·¹⁸⁽t⁻°·⁶⁴⁾) ³·°³ for females. L. vomerinus is a slow-growing species with a life span in excess of 10 years. Reproductive activity was shown to occur throughout the year, with a slight peak during the winter months. The adult sex ratio of fish > 37 cm TL was biased towards females. Length-at- 50 % sexual maturity was attained at 32. 1 cm TL for females and 23. 7 cm TL for males. The rate of natural mortality was estimated at 0. 15 year⁻¹, while fishing mortality rates during the 1970 s, 1980 s and 1990 s were estimated at 0. 01 year⁻¹, 0. 04 year⁻¹ and 0. 14 year⁻¹, respectively. Gillnetting for <b>monkfish</b> (300 mm stretched mesh) was highly efficient with a moderate bycatch of around 20 % during the two years of operation. The main bycatch species were red crab, spider crab, squalid sharks, rays and Cape and Deep-water hake. The mean length of the <b>monkfish</b> caught in gillnets (67 cm TL) was significantly larger than the <b>monkfish</b> landed by the trawlers (38 cm TL) and less than 1 % of immature fish were landed. Gillnet catch-per-unit-effort for <b>monkfish</b> fluctuated between 0. 03 and 0. 67 kg. day⁻¹. 50 m net panel⁻¹, with a soak time of between one and sixteen days. More than 50 % (by weight) of <b>monkfish</b> landed by <b>monkfish</b> and sole trawlers, consisted of fish below 36 cm TL. There was a significant increase in catches of juvenile <b>monkfish</b> during 1997 and 1998 in comparison to the period 1994 to 1996. Various types of rigid sorting grids were tested to release juvenile <b>monkfish</b> below 32 cm TL. Five grid designs were tested. These included an “Ex-it” grid with horizontal bars spaced at 55 mm, single grids with vertical and horizontal bars spaced at 55 mm and grids with circular openings of 110 and 168 mm in diameter. The most efficient design was the grid with circular openings of 110 cm in diameter, which ensured the escape of 66 % of <b>monkfish</b> smaller than 31 cm TL. However, studies need to be undertaken to quantify the survival of released fish and to test the feasibility of using grid sorters on commercial <b>monkfish</b> and sole trawling gear. The <b>monkfish</b> resource was assessed by means of length cohort analyses, the Thompson and Bell predictive model and by way of a deterministic age-structured production modelling approach. The length cohort analysis models were sensitive to the rate of natural mortality and insensitive to changes in the terminal fishing mortality rate. These biases may, however, not be serious provided that estimates of abundance are used to reflect relative changes. Fish ranging between 26 and 59 cm TL are the most heavily exploited. The Thompson and Bell model predicted that the <b>monkfish</b> resource is exploited above MSY -levels and a reduction of approximately 40 % in fishing effort would provide a higher yield. Yield-per-recruit ranged between 10 000 and 14 000 tonnes. Results should, however, be treated with caution, as the condition of steady state was not satisfied. The age-structured production model was tuned using trends in catch-per-unit-effort data, estimated by Generalised Linear Modeling, as well as relative abundance indices calculated from hake biomass surveys. The model was found to be sensitive to both the ‘steepness’ parameter h and estimates of natural mortality. The ‘depletion’ level of the <b>monkfish</b> resource is currently estimated to be 49 %. Estimated coefficients of variation were high (> 63 %) due to the lack of a consistent trend within the abundance indices to tune the model. Overall productivity of the <b>monkfish</b> resource was estimated to be approximately 16 %, similar to other southern African demersal resources. Results of the risk analyses suggest that catches in excess of 7 000 tonnes may be unsustainable and that catches of 5 000 or 6 000 tonnes would decrease the risk of stock collapse and possibly lead to a recovery in the stock. <b>Monkfish</b> management strategies were reviewed and these were considered in relation to the results of this study. The following management recommendations were made: to follow the precautionary approach and implement a total allowable catch for monkfish; to implement rigid sorting grids as these would be the most appropriate way in which to reduce catches of juvenile monkfish; to restrict soak time, depth of operation and implement means to reduce ‘ghost fishing’ by gillnetting and finally, to develop a management procedure for Namibian <b>monkfish</b> with the main objective being the sustainable exploitation of the resource...|$|R
