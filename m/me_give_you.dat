Protection is but the law of nature, the law of self-preservation, of self-development, of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man. [...] that protection is immoral.... Why, if protection builds up and elevates 63,000,000 [...] of people, the influence of those 63,000,000 of people elevates {{the rest of the}} world.

Of course, that applies to labor as to everything else. Let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a maxim that is a thousand times better than that, and it is the protection maxim: 'Buy where you can pay the easiest.' And that spot of earth is where labor wins its highest rewards.|$|E

We're taking away the hard work the athlete puts in and saying he became great just because of steroids. Let <b>me</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a perfect example.
