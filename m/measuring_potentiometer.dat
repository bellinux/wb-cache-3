40|$|Walking {{is one of}} the {{principal}} and complex movements of the human body. The human locomotion with two legs is a periodic physical activity occurring by driving of the bones by muscles, which are stimulated by electrical signals transferred by neurons from the brain. In this paper a kinematical analysis is firstly made using a simple mathematical model and mechanical equations, which describe the physical events, that cause normal walking procedure. Lagrange’s method and equations are used for the kinematical solution of motion. After this theoretical application, in contrary to many previous, generally model based mathematical studies; real measurements of both hip and knee angles of a healthy human being during bipedal walking under various circumstances are registered to make a certain decision of normal walking conditions. Using a special designed prophase, equipped with angle position <b>measuring</b> <b>potentiometers,</b> a series of experiments are made.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the amount of fluoride uptake by enamel of deciduous teeth from 3 types of self cured glass ionomers: Fuji II (GC Japan), Riva self-cure(SDI Australia) and SDS(Iran). Materials and Methods: This experimental study was conducted on thirty primary molars which were randomly divided into 3 groups. Each tooth was divided into buccal and lingual halves. Fuji II Glass-ionomer (GC Japan), Riva self-cure (SDI Australia) and SDS (Iran) were placed randomly on the surfaces of teeth in case group. All subjects were stored in artificial saliva (without fluoride) for a month and samples were obtained from each subject using Acid etch biopsy technique. The amount of fluoride and calcium in sample solutions were <b>measured</b> by <b>potentiometer</b> and atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The results were analyzed by t-test and ANOVA statistical tests.

40|$|Space {{structures}} such as {{the solar}} panels or antenna, when deployed in space, have large dimensions, low mass to size ratio, large inertias and relatively low structural rigidity. Due to space restrictions, these structures are originally in stowed configurations and are deployed into their full size in space. Typically, these systems {{at the end of}} deployment undergo locking at the joints and lose their rotational degrees of freedom at the joints. In addition, during locking vibrations are induced in these light-weight, flexible mechanisms which have to be actively or passively damped. In this paper a mathematical model with an experiment is presented for a two-link flexible system, which undergoes locking during motion. The structural flexibility is modelled by the finite element method, and the equations of motion are derived using the Lagrangian formulation. The locking at the joints is modelled by the momentum balance method, which enables one to predict the rigid body as well as the elastic motion of the system after locking. The experimental setup consists of two flexible aluminum links with a revolute joint {{at the end of each}} link, and has a locking mechanism for each joint. The links lock as a predefined angle. The links are instrumented with strain gages and the joint rotations are <b>measured</b> by <b>potentiometers.</b> The sensor readings are acquired and stored on a PC based data acquisition system. The simulation results such as the locking time, response of each joint and the strain at the base of each link match very well with the experimental results. Thus, the momentum balance method is capable of predicting fairly accurately the dynamics of a flexible system which undergo locking during motion...|$|R

40|$|The Potentiophotometer {{is a new}} {{instrument}} for measuring the absorption characteristics of solutions. A brief de-scription of its construction and theory of operation is presented, with illustrations of its use in the colorimetric quantitative analysis for inorganic phosphorus and total protein in serum. The potentiophotometric results correlate well (r = 0. 97 to 0. 98) with measurements made of the same solutions with either of two conventional spectro-photometers, the Gilford 300 N and the Coleman Jr. II. Additional Keyphrases: inorganic phosphorus and total protein measurements. absorptiometry The Potentiophotometer is a simple instrument, consisting of focused light source, cuvet holder, photo-voltaic cell, constant power source, two potentiometers, and a metering device. The photovoltaic cell and con-stant power source are arranged in series opposition (i. e., with like pole to like pole) so that {{the output of the}} photovoltaic cell is subtracted from the output of the constant power source. The two potentiometers (voltage dividers) appropriately expand the output of the dif-ference between the constant power source and the photovoltaic cell. Because the photovoltaic cell output varies logarithmically and inversely with the concen-tration of the substance being measured, and the power source output is constant, the operation may be ex-pressed as K- log T, where K is a constant and T is transmittance. This constitutes the electrical analog solution to Beer’s law, C 2 - log %T, where C is the concentration of the substance being <b>measured.</b> The <b>potentiometers,</b> when appropriately set, multiply the Beer’s law equation so that it is properly proportioned and C = k(2 - log %T), where the values of k and 2 are determined by the potentiometer settings.

40|$|Normal {{subjects}} and Parkinsonian patients performed a bimanual load lifting task. In this task, one "postural" forearm, {{held in a}} horizontal position while supporting a 1 kg weight, was unloaded either by the experimenter's hand (imposed unloading) or by the subject's other hand {{in response to a}} tone burst (voluntary unloading). The variables recorded were reaction time (RT: time interval between the tone and beginning of unloading) and movement time (MT: duration of the change in force measured by a force platform on the "postural" forearm). Elbow angle changes were also <b>measured</b> with a <b>potentiometer.</b> The EMG activity from brachioradialis of the "postural" arm and that from the biceps of the "active" arm were recorded. The Parkinsonian patients showed an increase in both RT and MT and an impairment of the co-ordination between movement and posture which was reflected in an increase in amplitude of the elbow rotation after voluntary unloading. Moreover, the decrease in EMG activity in the brachioradialis of the postural arm during unloading was less in Parkinsonian patients than in the normal group. This disorder of postural command was often accompanied by a lack of anticipatory EMG changes. Comparison between treated and non-treated patients showed that dopamine agonists brought about recovery of both RT and MT but did not improve postural co-ordination. The co-ordination was less impaired when the voluntary unloading was performed by the preferred hand. Several hypotheses are discussed concerning the mechanism underlying this impaired co-ordination...|$|R
40|$|Gyroscopes {{have played}} an {{important}} role in the science community with uses ranging from simple classroom demonstrations to cutting edge technological advancements. They offer a unique source of torque that has been proven useful in a wide range of applications. One common educational demonstration calls for a person to stand on a pivoting platform, and hold a spinning bicycle wheel with one hand on each side of the axle. As the person rotates their arms, causing precession of the bicycle tire, they begin to spin on the platform. This is due to the dynamic effect of the gyroscope and is a perfect example of a control moment gyro. This paper presents the use of control moment gyros as a compact way of dynamically controlling an inverted pendulum. The dynamic characteristics are derived for a dual-gyroscope configuration that generates torque proportional to the velocity about the gimbal axis. Classical control theory is used to design a controller that not only stabilizes the pendulum, but also controls the gyroscopes to return to a neutral steady state position. Control gains are adjusted to account for noise effects and to compensate for parameter errors, and an accelerometer is used to replace the <b>potentiometer</b> <b>measuring</b> the vertical angle. With the theory and background in place, experimental results are presented to verify the predicted response and validate the control approach. The end result is a stable system that is resilient to a broad range of external influences and erroneous measurements...|$|R

However, not all fluoride dentifrices are equally effective Purpose: The {{objective of this}} experimental study was to compare fluoride uptake from Pooneh pediatric toothpaste and an ADA-approved pediatric dentifrice, in sound enamel of primary teeth. Materials and Methods: In an in vitro randomized controlled trial, 20 sound primary canines were divided into 2 groups according to the experimental dentifrices. Each tooth was sectioned longitudinally into experimental and control halves. The test groups were treated with dentifrice slurries for 1 hour. All specimens were then suspended in 5 ml artificial saliva for 24 hours at 37 °C and were etched twice for 30 seconds with a 1 ml solution of 0. 5 M percholoric acid. Fluoride and calcium concentrations were <b>measured</b> by a <b>potentiometer</b> and an atomic absorption spectrophotometer,respectively. The collected {{data were analyzed using}} repeated measurement ANOVA and Tukey's test. Results: The mean fluoride concentrations in the Aqua fresh group (4098. 44 and 3755. 25 ppm in first and both layers respectively) were higher than Pooneh (first layer 2420. 51 ppm and both layers 2242. 73 ppm), and both were higher than the controls (P< 0. 05). No significant difference was observed between the control groups.

40|$|Background: Fluoride {{has been}} widely used in the {{prevention}} of dental caries for a long time. To prevent dental caries, fluoride must be induced in low amount at high frequency. Inducing it through implantation process even make slow release of small concentration of fluoride. Purpose: The aim of this research was to analyze whether the induction of monofluorophosphate (MFP) implant into the white rat mothers affects the level of fluoride in the incisors of their young babies. Method: The objects of the research were twenty white rat mothers in two days of pregnancy which then were divided into four groups (n= 5). First, those mothers have been induced with implant under their back skin until their born young babies in the age of 35 days (n= 5). The level of fluoride in the incisors of those young babies then is <b>measured</b> with <b>Potentiometer.</b> The obtained data were finally analyzed with One-Way ANOVA test and continued by with LSD test (p= 0. 05). Result: The result of this research showed that the means of the fluoride level in the incisors of those babies divided into those four groups in series were about 11956. 16 ± 201. 35 ppb (K), 27328. 04 ± 234. 56 ppb (P 1), 37267. 21 ± 248. 86 ppb (P 2), and 18103. 50 ± 267. 11 ppb (P 3). The result of ANOVA test then showed that the induction of various MFP implant levels significantly affected the level of fluoride in the incisors of the babies. The mean differences among the treatment groups after being tested with LSD 0. 05 were also significant. Conclusion: The finding confirm that the significant increasing of the optimal fluoride retention in the incisors of white rat babies can be achieved with the induction of fluoride with MFP ions implant in about 52. 98 mg.
