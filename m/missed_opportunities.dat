5|$|The distant {{ships were}} in fact the remains of Linois's squadron, which had put to sea on 13 March 1803 and {{operated}} in the Indian Ocean ever since. There Linois conducted a string of commerce raids that achieved minimal success, hampered by both the lack of naval stores at Île de France and Linois's hesitation {{in the face of}} the enemy. The squadron had <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> at Pulo Aura and the Battle of Vizagapatam in 1804 and against a conovy escorted by Sir Thomas Troubridge in 1805. Much reduced by detachments and shipwreck, Linois's squadron now consisted only of his ship of the line Marengo and the frigate Belle Poule. At 03:00 on 13 March, lookouts on Marengo sighted sails to the southwest and despite his officers' misgivings Linois ordered Marengo to investigate, in the hope that he had discovered another merchant convoy.|$|E
5|$|The {{collapse}} left Barnett and captain Yardley {{as the new}} men at the crease. Both players {{attacked the}} bowling but could not get their shots through the field for runs. Soon after, Lindwall {{was forced to leave}} the field due to a groin injury and did not bowl again. Barnett hit one four before Johnston bowled him for eight off the inside edge as he leaned onto the front foot. This brought Evans to the crease with the score at 60/6, and he attempted to disrupt the Australians' line and length by counter-attacking with a series of shots in front of the wicket. He drove the ball forward of point to the boundary for four, and was then given two lives. He hit Johnston hard to cover, but the catch went through Bradman for another boundary. The second chance of a catch went through Bradman's hand and struck the Australian captain in the abdomen. However, the <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> cost the tourists little; Evans hit a ball strongly but it was caught at close range at short leg by Morris. Without further addition to the score, Toshack trapped Yardley, who had lingered at the crease for 26 minutes in accumulating three runs, leg before wicket (lbw) with a ball that straightened after pitching, leaving the score at 74/8.|$|E

The most frequent reason for <b>missed</b> <b>opportunity</b> of vaccination was found as and ldquo;not being asked for vaccination status while the patient visited health institution for a any cause and rdquo; (37. 2 %).

25|$|The Germans {{appreciated}} that constant patrols by destroyers was both wasteful {{of time and}} resources of those ships, and left them open to attack. Instead, they designed defensive minefields to prevent enemy ships approaching and freed up the destroyers for duties escorting larger ships.

British ships were criticised for having fired considerable ammunition and torpedoes with little effect: this criticism later proved counter-productive when at the Battle of Dogger Bank, ships became excessively cautious of wasting ammunition and thus <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> to damage enemy vessels.|$|E

The senior quarterback threw for over 300 yards against the Big Ten's worst passing defense and led scoring drives of 79, 80, 99, 85 and 61 yards as the Trojans held a 16-minute advantage in time of possession.

The two teams met in Miren, a small town in the Primorska region near the Italian border, and Maribor won 2–0 with plenty of <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities.</b> They then faced another third division side, Zavrč, in the quarter-final. The match was played over two legs, the first leg being played in Zavrč. Maribor quickly found themselves in trouble when they faced a surprising two goal deficit within 28 minutes of play. They then fought back and with the goal from Željko Filipović they finished the first half, losing 2–1. Zavrč scored their third goal {{at the start of the}} second half to take a 3–1 lead before Maribor staged a comeback with goals from Etien Velikonja and Dragan Jelić, for the final score 3–3. In the second leg, in front of 4,500 spectators, Maribor dominated throughout the match, but only managed to score once for the final score 1–0, thus qualifying in the semi-final with the score 4–3 aggregate.|$|E

Paris Saint-Germain reached the last-32 and received a tough draw being given Bundesliga side Wolfsburg. Giant striker Guillaume Hoarau marked his return by scoring two late goals as the side from the French capital finished over the top of German outfit Wolfsburg. Paris Saint-Germain walloped Wolfsburg in Germany for a convincing aggregate victory in the last-32. Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Mickaël Landreau made a number of good saves to deny before Péguy Luyindula put an end to Wolfsburg's hopes of a fightback by netting a penalty. Jérôme Rothen doubled the lead on the hour with a terrific strike. Wolfsburg's Japanese star Makoto Hasebe reduced the arrears with a fine solo goal three minutes later, but Luyindula netted his sixth goal of the competition with a header from Clément Chantôme's cross. Paris Saint-Germain, UEFA Cup Winners' Cup winners, marched into the last-16 where they faced Portuguese side Sporting Braga.|$|E
25|$|The {{second quarter}} would {{be full of}} <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> and poor play from both teams. On the first play, a high snap from Bucs center Tony Mayberry went over quarterback Shaun King's head and into the end zone. King managed to knock {{the ball out of}} the end zone to prevent a touchdown, but it gave the Rams a safety and a 5–3 lead. Az-Zahir Hakim {{returned}} the free kick 15-yards to the Rams 40-yard line. Hakim also caught a 14-yard pass and ran for six as the team drove to the Bucs 26, but the drive was halted there and Wilkins missed a 44-yard field goal attempt. Following a punt from each team, Tampa Bay also got good field position from a good return, a 14-yard punt return from Karl Williams that gave them a first down on the Rams 45. Although they would drive to the St. Louis 26, they would ultimately fair no better than the Rams did. On third down, King lost a fumble while being sacked by Charlie Clemons. King recovered the ball, but the 13-yard loss pushed the team out of field goal range. The next time Tampa Bay had the ball, King threw a pass from the Rams 41 that went right into the arms of St. Louis defensive back Todd Lyght. A few plays later, the half ended with the score still 5-3, despite the Rams 159–75 advantage over the Buccaneers in total yards.|$|E
