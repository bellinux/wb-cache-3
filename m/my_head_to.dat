500|$|Björk {{chose the}} title Post for two reasons. Firstly, {{it refers to}} the fact that all the songs on the album were written after her move to England, while the songs on Debut were songs she had written during the {{previous}} ten years of her life in Iceland. In a 1996 interview, Björk said: [...] "I always knew it would be two albums and that's why I called them Debut and Post. Before and after". Secondly, the title was inspired by the singer's desire to communicate with friends and family back in Iceland, giving Post the additional meaning of [...] "mail". Talking with Raw in 1996, Björk stated: [...] "I called the record Post, because I always address my songs back in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> Iceland in a letter. Because it was such a big jump for me to move away from all my relatives, all my friends, everything I know".|$|E
500|$|By now Blenheim {{was under}} assault from every side by three British generals: Cutts, Churchill, and Orkney. The French had repulsed every attack with heavy slaughter, but many had seen what had {{happened}} on the plain and what its consequences to them would be; their army was routed and they were cut off. Orkney, attacking from the rear, now tried a different tactic – [...] "...it came into <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> beat parley", he later wrote, [...] "which they accepted of and immediately their Brigadier de Nouville capitulated with me to be prisoner at discretion and lay down their arms." [...] Threatened by Allied guns, other units followed their example. However, {{it was not until}} 21:00 that the Marquis de Blanzac, who had taken charge in Clérambault's absence, reluctantly accepted the inevitability of defeat, and some 10,000 of France's best infantry had laid down their arms.|$|E

500|$|The new couple {{lived in}} Godwick Manor, their peace {{disturbed}} in 1776 when Wenman's health began to fail. He finally died on 10 April after [...] "a constipation which medicine could not remove", leaving Coke {{in charge of}} a 30,000 acre estate at the age of 22. Soon after his father's death, Harbord and other senior Whigs visited Coke and asked him to stand for Norfolk in his father's stead. Coke was not enthusiastic, not seeing himself as a politician and hoping to enjoy his new estates and wealth, but after his visitors pointed out a Tory might otherwise replace him [...] "my blood chilled all over me from <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> my foot, and I came forward". On 12 April he issued a manifesto to the Norfolk electorate, soon returning to campaign, and after being unanimously nominated on 27 April he was elected in May.|$|E
500|$|... "Close My Eyes" [...] is a downtempo piano led song, {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of four minutes and 19 seconds. The lyrical {{content of the}} song speaks indirectly about Carey's relationship with Mottola, and reflects on times in her life where she has had personal struggles and troubles. Her past {{is presented in the}} lyrics [...] "I was a wayward child, with {{the weight of the world}} that I held deep inside" [...] and [...] "Life was a winding road, and I learned many things little ones shouldn't know." [...] As described by David Browne for Entertainment Weekly, Carey [...] "paints herself" [...] in the lyrics as [...] "A wayward child, with the weight of the world". He also noted that the singer seems concerned that she had to grow up quicker than was perhaps necessary, in order to live her life in a controlled environment, [...] "Maybe I grew up a little too soon." [...] During the chorus, Carey lightens the mood of the song by singing about having courage to face times of adversity, [...] "But I closed my eyes, steadied my feet on the ground, raised <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the sky. And though times rolled by, still I feel like a child as I look at the moon. Maybe I grew up a little too soon." [...] Jon Pareles for The New York Times wrote that Carey [...] "coos" [...] the lyrics [...] "Maybe I grew up a little too soon" [...] and [...] "That woman-child inside was on the verge of fading/ Thankfully I woke up in time." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the height}} of the {{fighting}} on May 3, Hooker suffered an injury when at 9:15a.m. a Confederate cannonball hit a wooden pillar he was leaning against at his headquarters. He later wrote that half of the pillar [...] "violently ... in an erect position from <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> my feet." [...] He likely received a concussion, which was sufficiently severe to render him unconscious for over an hour. Although clearly incapacitated after he arose, Hooker refused to turn over command temporarily to his second-in-command, Maj. Gen. Darius N. Couch, and, with Hooker's chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Daniel Butterfield, and Sedgwick out of communication (again due to the failure of the telegraph lines), there was no one at headquarters with sufficient rank or stature to convince Hooker otherwise. This failure may have affected Union performance over the next day and may have directly contributed to Hooker's seeming lack of nerve and timid performance {{throughout the rest of the}} battle.|$|E

2500|$|Clarkson co-wrote seven tracks {{from the}} album, and collaborated with other {{artists such as}} Ester Dean and Bonnie McKee for the first time. Clarkson stated that the new music will be {{different}} from her previous albums, describing it as [...] "like Garbage-meets-pop-meets-Muse." [...] Claude Kelly remarked that the songs he wrote [...] "were in true Kelly Clarkson form; singer records that showcase her voice, but also show her edge and her attitude and her personality." [...] He also explained that [...] " [...] always up-tempo for me {{when it comes to}} Kelly. I like to hear her in kick-butt mode. She has an edge to her voice that you want to hear her sing high and get in your face". Darkchild then remarked that he and Lauren Christy wrote a song [...] "that's just crazy pop-rock", and [...] "The first person who came into <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> do it was Kelly Clarkson." [...] Clarkson stated that the album ended up going in a different direction than what they were originally going for.|$|E
2500|$|The {{program was}} first advertised by Network Ten in December 2005, with promos {{depicting}} Wedgedale, a stereotypical Australian urban sprawl suburb. The show’s pilot debuted on Network Ten on 30 May 2006. It is a sketch based format similar to Fast Forward or The Comedy Company. The {{difference is that}} nearly all the sketches {{take place in the}} same town, so the transition from sketch to sketch often involves a reference to the previous one. Most transitions involve a timelapse shot that takes the audience from one location to another, but sometimes the reference is more direct and seamless. This is used so often, that a sketch based on it was made. In one episode, the character, Sandra Sultry said [...] "Next up, I'll turn <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the TV behind me; it's a clever transitional device which will put you through to the next item..."The first season finale was broadcast on 21 November 2006. [...] "Sounds Funny" [...] is the show's theme. [...] Hunter Kaine was recommended as the singer by a production team member's friend.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the campaign, Sun Quan had two boxes made to {{hold the}} heads of Huang Zu and Su Fei (蘇飛). After Huang Zu's defeat, Su Fei was also {{captured}} and he immediately asked someone to inform Gan Ning. Gan Ning said, [...] "If Su Fei did not speak up, I'd have forgotten about him." [...] Later, when Sun Quan and his officers were celebrating the victory, Gan Ning left his seat and knelt down before his lord. He kowtowed until his face was covered in blood and with tears in his eyes, he pleaded with Sun Quan, [...] "I owe Su Fei a favour. If not for him, I'd have been dead and my body abandoned in a ravine. I'd {{not have been able}} to serve under you. Now, even though Su Fei's actions warrant death, I still hope you can spare him." [...] Sun Quan was moved and he asked, [...] "What if he leaves after I spare his life?" [...] Gan Ning replied, [...] "Su Fei will be grateful if he is spared from death. He'll not leave even if you try to chase him away. Why would he still seek his own doom? If he really does that, I'm willing to use <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> replace his in the box." [...] Sun Quan then pardoned Su Fei.|$|E
