40|$|The rudder {{effect of}} a sport {{airplane}} at high angles of attack was to be improved. This made it necessary to make a cut-out {{in the center of}} the continuous elevator so as to enlarge the rudder downward. This cut-out which reduced the rudder area by 12. 5 percent changed the static stability of the airplane as well as the elevator effect. Flight measurements showed the stability zone with locked elevator to be 1. 8 percent less at full throttle and at idling to be 1. 3 percent less than the <b>mean</b> <b>wing</b> <b>chord.</b> The effect of the cut-out on the control forces could not be determined owing to insufficient instrumental accuracy at the extremely low existing forces.

40|$|Tabulated {{results of}} a wind-tunnel {{investigation}} of the aerodynamic loads on a canard airplane model with a single vertical tail are presented for Mach numbers from 0. 70 to 2. 22. The Reynolds number for the measurements was 2. 9 x 10 (exp 6) based on the <b>wing</b> <b>mean</b> aerodynamic <b>chord.</b> The results include local static pressure coefficients measured on the wing, body, and vertical tail for angles of attack from - 4 deg to + 16 deg, angles of sideslip of 0 deg and 5. 3 deg, vertical-tail settings of 0 deg and 5 deg, and nominal canard deflections of 0 deg and 10 deg. Also included are section force and moment coefficients obtained from integrations of the local pressures and model-component force and moment coefficients obtained from integrations of the section coefficients. Geometric details of the model and {{the locations of the}} pressure orifices are shown. An index to the data contained herein is presented and definitions of nomenclature are given...|$|R
40|$|Flat-plate flaps with no wing cutouts and flaps having Clark Y {{sections}} with corresponding cutouts made in wing {{were tested}} for various flap deflections, chord-wise locations, and gaps between flaps and airfoil contour. The drag was slightly lower for wing with airfoil section flaps. Satisfactory aileron effectiveness was obtained with flap gap of 20 % <b>wing</b> <b>chord</b> and flap-nose location of 80 percent <b>wing</b> <b>chord</b> behind leading edge. Airflow {{was smooth and}} buffeting negligible...|$|R
