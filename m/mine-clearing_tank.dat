5000|$|In {{the light}} of {{operations}} during the US landing on Omaha beach, Bradley's decision has been criticised as {{it was felt that}} use of the range of [...] "funnies" [...] would have saved American lives. After D-Day, American forces did make limited use of the Sherman Crab <b>mine-clearing</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|E
50|$|On 17 June {{the assault}} {{began with a}} {{bombardment}} from the Royal Artillery’s 7.2 in guns and ships off-shore. Under their new commander, Lt. Col Palmer, 41 Commando and forty-four armoured engineering vehicles attacked from the north while other tanks created a diversion from the southwest. Sherman Crabs (a <b>mine-clearing</b> <b>tank),</b> cleared {{the way through the}} minefields while the AVREs battered the bunkers with their guns. The effect of such fire was devastating on the German defenders. When the commandos entered the entrenchment and opened fire, {{it was clear that the}} station could no longer be defended. The two hundred and twenty seven remaining Luftwaffe force surrendered and the last of the 4th Special Service Brigade’s D-Day objectives was finally achieved.|$|E

50|$|At 06:00, before dawn, on 18 November, giant {{searchlights}} ("canal defence lights") of the 357th Searchlight Battery, Royal Artillery provided hazy {{indirect light}} for the <b>mine-clearing</b> flail <b>tanks</b> supporting the infantry. These tanks {{moved toward the}} German mine field between Geilenkirchen and Immendorf, but, on the wet ground, mud lessened the flails′ effectiveness and so engineers followed with mine detectors.|$|R
2500|$|On 17 June at 4:30p.m. {{the assault}} {{began with a}} {{bombardment}} from Royal Artillery [...] howitzers and Royal Navy ships just offshore. Under their new commander, Lieutenant Colonel Eric Palmer, 41 Commando and forty-four armoured engineering vehicles attacked from the north, while other tanks created a diversion from the south-west. After {{half an hour of}} continuous bombardment, the armour advanced with 28 Sherman Crabs (<b>mine-clearing</b> <b>tanks)</b> of the 22nd Dragoons, that cleared the way through the minefields. The 26th Assault Squadron's 17 Churchill tank AVREs with their spigot mortar demolition guns followed behind. At the same time the remainder of the squadron gave covering fire in particular against the supposed targets of the five anti-tank guns. While the Crabs were successful in clearing the minefields, AVRES with their [...] "Flying Dustbin" [...] high explosive bombs caused severe destruction; one hit a 50mm gun and another an open emplacement at [...] range. The effect of such fire was devastating to the German defenders.|$|R
50|$|On 17 June, {{a massive}} {{offensive}} by the British 41 Commando, Royal Marines - preceded by an artillery bombardment {{and supported by}} <b>mine-clearing</b> and anti-bunker <b>tanks</b> of 79th Armoured Division - secured the surrender of the garrison.|$|R
50|$|Operation Infatuate II was the amphibious {{landing at}} Westkapelle, also {{conducted}} {{on the morning of}} November 1. Air support was limited due to the weather conditions. After a heavy naval bombardment by the Royal Navy (a battleship and two monitors plus a support squadron of landing craft carrying guns), troops of 4th Special Service Brigade (Nos. 41, 47, and 48 Royal Marines Commando and No. 10 Inter Allied Commando, consisting mainly of Belgian and Norwegian troops) supported by the specialized armoured vehicles (amphibious transports, <b>mine-clearing</b> <b>tanks,</b> bulldozers, etc.) of the 79th Armoured Division were landed {{on both sides of the}} gap in the sea dyke, using large landing craft as well as amphibious vehicles to bring men and tanks ashore. Heavy fighting ensued here as well before the ruins of the town were captured. Part of the troops moved south-east toward Vlissingen, while the main force went north-east to clear the northern half of Walcheren and link up with the Canadian troops who had established a bridgehead on the eastern part of the island. Fierce resistance was again offered by some of the German troops defending this area, so that fighting continued until November 7.|$|R
50|$|In November 2013 Polish Defense Ministry {{acquired}} 119 tanks {{from the}} German Army. These include 105 Leopard 2A5 tanks and 14 2A4 variants, and stated {{they want the}} Leopard {{to be the main}} tank operated by the Polish Army. “The version which we are acquiring will remain operational {{for many years to come}} without the need to be modernized,” a Polish Defense Ministry official said. Deliveries are scheduled from 2014 to 2015. The contract is worth €180 million (US $243 million), according to the Polish MoD. The procurement also covers related military equipment, including transportation vehicles, machine guns, training and radio location systems. In 2003 Poland obtained 128 of these Leopard tanks from Germany for the bargain basement price of $21.6 million along with 23 MiG-29 fighters for only $30 million. The tanks were selected by Polish tank experts from among the three hundred Leopard 2s recently placed in storage after being taken out of service by the downsized German Army. The original 128 Leopards still had at least 75 percent of their operational life remaining. That deal included 8 Buffel armored recovery vehicles, four Biber bridgelayers, four Keiler <b>mine-clearing</b> <b>tanks,</b> and ten M577 command post vehicles. The Polish military is aiming to overhaul these 128 Leopard 2A4 tanks it already operates.|$|R
25|$|The Battle of Douvres Radar Station was {{military}} {{engagement of}} World War II {{as part of}} the Invasion of Normandy, that took place the on 17 June 1944. The attack was by British 41 Commando, Royal Marines, the station and area were defended mainly by Luftwaffe ground forces. Preceded by an artillery bombardment and supported by <b>mine-clearing</b> and anti-bunker <b>tanks</b> of 79th Armoured Division, the Marines were able to secure the surrender of the garrison.|$|R
50|$|Tanks {{have often}} been {{modified}} for special purposes. The most common is armoured recovery vehicles, used during combat for recovery or repair of battle-damaged and inoperable armoured fighting vehicles. Another common use is to provide armoured capability for combat engineers. These include tanks carrying large-calibre demolition guns, with flails or ploughs for <b>mine-clearing,</b> or flame <b>tanks</b> armed with flamethrowers. The tank occasionally may lose its weapons and the chassis alone may be used, as in bridge-laying tanks.|$|R
