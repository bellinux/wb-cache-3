40|$|We use UK {{survey data}} on {{variation}} in business optimism by <b>manufacturing</b> <b>size</b> group {{to estimate the}} determinants of optimism using OLS and SURE. There are similarities across the size groups but also some differences: the medium-size group {{seems to have been}} unusually affected by real interest rates in recent years. We also model investment authorisations, conditional on business optimism. Again, there are similarities across the size groups. However, the largest-size group, and possibly also the medium-size group, seem to be investing less in recent years in relation to reported optimism. By contrast, capital investment by smaller-sized firms has been stable in relation to business optimism. Some tentative explanations for these findings are explored.

40|$|Within {{pharmaceutical}} <b>manufacturing,</b> <b>size</b> {{reduction is}} one of the most extensively used and vital unit operations. Size reduction is a process of reducing large solid unit masses into small unit masses, coarse particles or fine particles. Size reduction process is also termed as Comminution or Diminution or Pulverizations. There are many types of size-reduction equipment, which are often developed empirically to handle specific materials and then are applied in other situations. Knowing the properties of the material to be processed is essential. Probably the most important characteristic governing size reduction is hardness because almost all size-reduction techniques involve somehow creating new surface area and this requires adding energy proportional to the bonds holding the feed particles together. Size Reduction is an important operation in many pharmaceutical applications. The important reasons for size reduction are easy handling, increase in surface area per unit volume and separation of entrapped components...|$|E
40|$|Within {{pharmaceutical}} <b>manufacturing,</b> <b>size</b> {{reduction is}} one of the most extensively used and vital unit operations. Size reduction in tablet production is achieved primarily through milling procedures, which allows for attaining product uniformity, optimizing product solubility, and improving bioavailability. Additionally, powders with a narrow range of size distribution can obviate problems in downstream processing as pertains to blending, compression, and coating as well as improve drug performance 1. The purpose this study was to characterize the effect of various size reduction parameters as a result of the pharmaceutical milling process on a lactose wet granulation formulation and chemically active extruded lentils. Variations in sizing as a result of milling conditions were assessed using samples of extrudated lentils (extrudate) and lactose granules. Lactose granules and extrudate were milled and compared using the L 1 A Fitz mill based on blade orientation, mill speed, and screen size. Additionally, the 197 Comil was evaluated as a potential substitute for extrudate milling by comparing resulting PSD, morphology, and angle of repose using extrudate milled on both the 197 Comil and L 1 A Fitz mil. For lactose granules, data showed that fine particle sizing occurred at 9000 RPM, while only larger particles were reduced at 1000 RPM, 4000 RPM, and 6600 RPM. Large particles were reduced much more effectively as speed increased from 1000 RPM to 4000 RPM, however less change was seen from 4000 RPM and 6600 RPM. For both extrudate and granules, particle size decreased as mill speed was increased and smaller screens were utilized. Resulting data for milled extrudate provides support for obtaining analogous particle properties between the two mill types. Because of a lack of direct correlation between milling conditions on the Comil and Fitz Mill, processes should be developed independently in order to achieve desired properties...|$|E

40|$|International {{markets for}} food {{products}} {{have shown a}} strong growth in recent years. Trade flows between countries are increasing and {{can be seen as}} a reflection of a higher degree of competition in both domestic and international markets. At the same time, consumers show a growing interest in product attributes associated with the geographical origin of the product and/or specific production methods. This paper studies the region specialization in food industries and uses a shift share analysis to identify regions with comparative advantages in food production in Sweden. The Swedish food sector is of significant size in the domestic economy, and is the fourth largest industry in the Swedish manufacturing sector. The food sector hosts both small and large firms, and is represented in all (geographical) parts of the country. As in many European countries, the food sector is important with respect to employment in rural areas and therefore an obvious target for rural policies. Recent studies of food industries indicate that differences in regional characteristics, such as concentration of firms in the industry (clusters) and concentration of food exporters partly explain the export behavior of firms in the Swedish food industry and food processing firms in France. These findings indicate that location specific factors impact on firms 2 Ì† 019 competitiveness in international markets. This paper explores this issue further in an empirical analysis of regional comparative advantages in food processing. The purpose of this study is to analyze what type of regional characteristics that stimulate regional specialization in food industries. Of particular interest is the importance of unique regional food specialties, smallscale <b>manufacturing,</b> <b>size</b> of the local market and accessibility to foreign customers in shaping regional comparative advantages in food manufacturing...|$|E
40|$|The Joint {{harmonized}} Manufacturing {{survey for}} Italy, {{carried out by}} the Institute of Studies and Economic Analysis (ISAE, formerly ISCO), has a long history: it began on a quarterly basis in 1959, becoming monthly in 1962. The survey was then broadly modified in several occasions; in particular, in 1986 it was re-designed in order to provide data also at the regional level, adopting a new stratified random sample, the strata represented by the sector, region and size of the firm. In 1998, the sample was upgraded further, using an optimal allocation of the reporting units to the sample strata (Cochran, 1977). These changes satisfied the demand for more detailed and, at the same time, better harmonized data. However, at this stage, the processing of the results was still based on a very detailed industry grid based on the old NACE 1970 classification, re-codified to obtain harmonized data for the Main Industrial Groups and total <b>manufacturing.</b> <b>Size</b> weights were used in the processing of the results, but there were still some differences in the elaboration of the data at the national and regional level, resulting in a not fully-fledged comparability between local and national data. For these reasons, in 2003 ISAE started a re-thinking of the manufacturing survey processing phase. The resulting re-engineering process recently implemented by ISAE is described in this paper. It has reached two main relevant goals: i. The underlying industrial structure for the aggregation of survey results is now based on the NACERev 1. 1 classification, at the 3 -digit level, adapted to take into consideration the structure of Italian economy. ii. The weighting scheme is now based on a coherent system of size weights, based on a four-stage method in which, firstly, the balance Ba,j for question a, firm j, is aggregated in each strata, using the j-firm employees as weights; in the following stages, the result for each strata is progressively aggregated to calculate the Industry total, using value added weights, provided by an external source (i. e., the National Institute for Statistics, ISTAT). The main consequence is that now results at the regional and dimensional level are fully comparable to the ones for the entire industry. Historical data up to 1991 have been recalculated accordingly to the new aggregation scheme and are presented here as a conclusion of the paper. ...|$|E
40|$|The Office of Chief Technologist, NASA {{identified}} {{the need for}} research and technology development in part from NASAs Strategic Goal 3. 3 of the NASA Strategic Plan to develop and demonstrate the critical technologies that will make NASAs exploration, science, and discovery missions more affordable and more capable. Furthermore, the Game Changing Development Program is a primary avenue to achieve the Agencys 2011 strategic goal to Create the innovative new space technologies for our exploration, science, and economic future. The National Research Council (NRC) Space Technology Roadmaps and Priorities report highlights six challenges and they are: Mass to Surface, Surface Access, Precision Landing, Surface Hazard Detection and Avoidance, Safety and Mission Assurance, and Affordability. In order for NASA to meet these challenges, the report recommends immediate focus on Rigid and Flexible Thermal Protection Systems. Rigid TPS systems such as Avcoat or SLA are honeycomb based and PICA {{is in the form}} of tiles. The honeycomb systems are manufactured using techniques that require filling of each (38 cell) by hand, and in a limited amount of time all of the cells must be filled and the heatshield must be cured. The tile systems such as PICA pose a different challenge as the low strain-to-failure and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>size</b> limitations require large number of small tiles with gap-fillers between the tiles. Recent investments in flexible ablative systems have given rise to the potential for conformal ablative TPS. A conformal TPS over a rigid aeroshell has the potential to solve a number of challenges faced by traditional rigid TPS materials. The high strain-to-failure nature of the conformal ablative materials will allow integration of the TPS with the underlying aeroshell structure much easier and enable monolithic-like configuration and larger segments (or parts) to be used. By reducing the overall part count, the cost of installation (based on cost comparisons between blanket and tile materials on shuttle) should be significantly reduced. The conformal ablator design will include a simplified design of seams between gore panels, which should eliminate the need for gap filler design, and should accommodate a wider range of allowable carrier structure imperfections when compared to a rigid material such as PICA. The Conformal TPS development project leverages the past investments made by earlier projects with a goal to develop and deliver a TRL 5 conformal TPS capable of 250 Wcm 2 for missions such as MSL or COTS missions. The capabilities goal for the conformal TPS is similar to an MSL design reference mission (250 Wcm 2) with matching pressures and shear environments. Both conformal and flexible carbon-felt based materials were successfully tested in stagnation aerothermal environments above 500 Wcm 2 under earlier programs. Results on a myriad of materials developed during FY 11 were used to determine which materials to start with in FY 12. In FY 12, the conformal TPS element focused on establishing materials requirements based on MSL-type and COTS Low Earth orbit (LEO) conditions (q 250 Wcm 2) to develop and deliver a Conformal Ablative TPS. In FY 13, development and refining metrics for mission utilization of conformal ablator technology along with assessment for potential mission stakeholders will be carried out...|$|E

Using a large scale survey of 149 firms across three States in Brazil, this paper examines the competitive capabilities of small and medium <b>sized</b> <b>manufacturing</b> companies; and the link between their capabilities and performance. Our results show that the best-performing firms are those that lead on capabilities like quality and innovativeness rather than on cost. Much of the available literature on manufacturing strategy emphasizes only four key competitive priorities: cost, flexibility, quality and delivery. Consequently, our results confirm innovativeness as an important, fifth capability for small and medium sized firms in Brazil to maintain or develop.
