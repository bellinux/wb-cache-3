5|$|At the lek, {{males have}} been {{observed}} to break up into pairs, performing “confrontation displays”. This consists of facing each other while bowing, jumping, and flapping their wings, sometimes even snapping their bills, {{and at the same}} time giving off various squawking and grunting calls. When the female approaches, it becomes even <b>more</b> <b>intense.</b> The display turns into a cacophony of bright color and a frenzied activity filling the air with very strange sounds.|$|E
5|$|Based on Béla Bánáthy's {{original}} work, {{the program}} is still organized into three phases, each consisting of a candidate, youth staff, and an adult staff level. This structure allows youth to develop their leadership skills over several years through gradually <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> and more advanced levels of instruction. Each level is tailored {{to the needs of}} youth at specific ages and maturity levels.|$|E
5|$|Children with high-functioning autism {{suffer from}} <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> and {{frequent}} loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief {{that children with}} autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may {{affect the quality of}} life more deeply.|$|E

50|$|Especially {{interesting}} is today The Threepenny Opera (1930), directed by G.W. Pabst. Andrejew built for this film huge sets of the imaginary London. These decors artistically continue German Expressionism of the 1920s, but {{bring it to}} another level, creating the world far <b>more</b> realistic, <b>intense</b> and somber.|$|R
5|$|Florida mice breed {{throughout}} the year with a peak between July and December, a lesser peak in January and February, and a lull or cessation in April and May. Unlike most murids, copulatory behavior lacks intravaginal thrusting, the intromission thrust is <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> than the dismount, there is no lock, and ejaculation occurs with every thrust.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that aposematism and mimicry is less evident in marine invertebrates than terrestrial insects because predation is a <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> selective force for many insects, which also disperse as adults rather than as larvae and have much shorter generation times. Further, {{there is evidence that}} fish predators such as blueheads may adapt to visual cues more rapidly than do birds, making aposematism less effective.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting on his {{stint in}} first season of Indian Super League, Chopra {{admitted}} that ISL {{turned out to}} be much <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> and competitive than he had anticipated.

40|$|Al-LiBH 4 {{composite}} materials were {{prepared by the}} mechanical ball milling. The results of the hydrogen-production curves and X-ray diffraction patterns show that when the reaction temperature is higher, the mutual promotion effect between aluminum and LiBH 4 will be <b>more</b> <b>intensed,</b> and the generation of hydrogen will be more. The milled materials have good properties of hydrogen generation in water at room temperature, especially for the Al- 25 % LiBH 4 (mass fraction of LiBH 4 is 25 %) material milled for 5 h with a ball/material ratio of 30 : 1, which can produce 720 mL/g hydrogen. At 90 degrees C, the Al- 25 % LiBH 4 material can produce 2026 mL/g hydrogen with the hydrogen yield of 95 % while the Al- 30 % LiBH 4 material can produce 2211 mL/g hydrogen with the hydrogen yield of 96 %...|$|R
25|$|However, such {{retrospective}} {{studies were}} subject to certain biases that may have affected the results. For example, the participants could {{have been influenced by}} a number of memory biases such as a possible selective memory bias for events that were <b>more</b> emotionally <b>intense,</b> or a possible bias to more easily recall more recent events.|$|R
5|$|Rolling {{stock on}} the New York City Subway {{produces}} {{high levels of}} noise that exceed guidelines set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In 2006, Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health found noise levels averaged 95 decibel (dB) inside subway cars and 94dB on platforms. Daily exposure to noise at such levels {{for as little as}} 30 minutes can lead to hearing loss. Noise on one in 10 platforms exceeded 100dB. Under WHO and EPA guidelines, noise exposure at that level is limited to 1.5 minutes. A subsequent study by Columbia and the University of Washington found higher average noise levels in the subway (80.4dB) than on commuter trains including Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) (79.4dB), Metro-North (75.1dB) and Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) (74.9dB). Since the decibel scale is a logarithmic scale, sound at 95dB is 10 times <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> than at 85dB, 100 times <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> than at 75dB, and so forth. In the second study, peak subway noise registered at 102.1dB.|$|E
5|$|Slow second movement, {{in a key}} {{different}} from the tonic, and in A–B–A (ternary) or A–B–A–B–A form.

5|$|The 1821 Norfolk and Long Island Hurricane {{was one of}} four known {{tropical}} cyclones {{that have}} made landfall in New York City. Another, even <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> hurricane in pre-Columbian times (sometime between 1278 and 1438) left evidence that was detected in southern New Jersey by paleotempestological research. The third was the 1893 New York hurricane, and the fourth was Hurricane Irene in 2011.|$|E

5|$|The hawksbill {{sea turtle}} {{has been shown}} to be biofluorescent and is the first reptile {{recorded}} with this characteristic. It is unknown if this is derived from the turtle's diet, which includes biofluorescent organisms like the hard coral Physogyra lichtensteini. Males have <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> pigmentation than females, and a behavioural role of these differences is speculated.|$|E
5|$|The minimum central {{pressure}} of these storms is, {{for the most}} part, estimated from satellite imagery using the Dvorak technique. In the case of Kenna, Ava, and Patricia, the central pressure was measured by hurricane hunter aircraft flying into the storm. Because of the estimation of central pressures, {{it is possible that}} other storms <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> than these have formed.|$|E
5|$|According to Liz Tynan from James Cook University, the Maralinga {{tests were}} a {{striking}} {{example of what}} can happen when the popular media are unable to report on activities that the government may be trying to hide. Maralinga was an example of extreme secrecy, but by the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged, whistle-blowers such as Avon Hudson spoke out and political scrutiny became <b>more</b> <b>intense.</b> The investigative journalist Brian Toohey ran a series of stories in the Australian Financial Review in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission.|$|E

50|$|Louis {{destroyed}} many of {{his paintings}} between 1955 and 1957. He resumed work on the Veils in 1958-59. These were followed by Florals and Columns (1960), Unfurleds (1960-61)—in which rivulets of <b>more</b> opaque, <b>intense</b> color flow {{from both sides of}} large white fields of raw canvas—and finally the Stripe paintings (1961-62). Between summer 1960 and January/February 1961, he created about 150 Unfurleds, generally on mural-size canvases.|$|R
50|$|The series can be loosely {{considered}} a magical girl story. However, this series deviates from more conventional magical girl themes {{in that it}} addresses topics that are for a more mature audience, such as child abuse, eating disorders, and possibly misanthropy. Nevertheless, it illustrates the main character's coming of age with each episode, becoming more and <b>more</b> emotionally <b>intense</b> as the story goes on.|$|R
5|$|Following a brief {{absence from}} television, The Miz {{returned}} to SmackDown! to host an interview segment named Miz TV. After the unsuccessful segment, The Miz returned to in-ring competition with a <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> style {{and began to}} pick up wins once again. On the June 11, 2007 episode of Raw, Mizanin faced off against Snitsky in a match to determine a draft pick for SmackDown!. Snitsky easily defeated The Miz to give ECW the draft pick, but after constantly assaulting The Miz after the match, the referee reversed the decision and awarded the match to Miz, thus allowing SmackDown! a draft pick. SmackDown!'s pick was then revealed to be Chris Masters.|$|E
5|$|From January to April 1916, Kippenberger {{underwent}} {{basic training}} at Trentham Military Camp {{as part of}} the 12th Reinforcement of the NZEF. On 1 May, he embarked for Europe to join the New Zealand Division. However, during transit his transport ship was unexpectedly diverted to Egypt. For two months, his contingent was based at the training camp of the Australian Imperial Force at Tel-el-Kebir but had {{very little to do with}} only a few hours of training each day. The 12th Reinforcement left in July for Sling Camp in England, where it underwent <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> training.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede {{also has}} polar caps, likely {{composed}} of water frost. The frost extends to 40° latitude. These polar caps were first {{seen by the}} Voyager spacecraft. Theories on {{the formation of the}} caps include the migration of water to higher latitudes and bombardment of the ice by plasma. Data from Galileo suggests the latter is correct. The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in <b>more</b> <b>intense</b> charged particle bombardment of its surface in the unprotected polar regions; sputtering then leads to redistribution of water molecules, with frost migrating to locally colder areas within the polar terrain.|$|E
30|$|The trivial {{synthetic}} UMN logo inversion {{problem is}} the only case where a competing method matches the residual RMS produced by the TNT-NN solution. For the <b>more</b> computationally <b>intense</b> natural samples, only the small inversions of the Hawaiian basalt and ferromanganese crust were attempted using an alternative method. Other scenarios were considered {{large enough to be}} intractable and computational tactics violating physicality (piecewise inversion and dipole thresholding) were undesirable.|$|R
