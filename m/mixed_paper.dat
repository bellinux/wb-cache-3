50|$|There {{are three}} {{categories}} of paper {{that can be used}} as feedstocks for making recycled paper: mill broke, pre-consumer waste, and post-consumer waste. Mill broke is paper trimmings and other paper scrap from the manufacture of paper, and is recycled internally in a paper mill. Pre-consumer waste is material that was discarded before it was ready for consumer use. Post-consumer waste is material discarded after consumer use such as old magazines, old telephone directories, and residential <b>mixed</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|E

50|$|Companies {{have adapted}} by {{implementing}} new creative ideas related to sustainability, such as preparing upgraded technology that can transform the product rather than throwing away old materials. New solutions that improve {{recycling and waste}} redirecting can ultimately reduce costs and increase profits. For example, Wal-Mart has redirected more than 64 percent of the waste generated by stores and Sam’s Club facilities. In 2009 alone, they recycled more than 1.3 million pounds of aluminum, 120 million pounds of plastics, 11.6 million pounds of <b>mixed</b> <b>paper</b> and 4.6 billion pounds of cardboard. Annually, they expect to save around $20 million and prevent 38 million pounds of waste being sent to landfills.|$|E

50|$|A clean MRF accepts {{recyclable}} comingled {{materials that}} have already been separated at the source from municipal solid waste generated by either residential or commercial sources. There are a variety of clean MRFs. The most common are single stream where all recyclable material is mixed, or dual stream MRFs, where source-separated recyclables are delivered in a mixed container stream (typically glass, ferrous metal, aluminum and other non-ferrous metals, PET No.1 and HDPE No.2 plastics) and a <b>mixed</b> <b>paper</b> stream including corrugated cardboard boxes, newspapers, magazines, office paper and junk mail.

The program, also sponsored by the Pike County Board of Education and funded through Litter Abatement funds, sends a representative to local schools to educate children about becoming litter free.The board will also emphasize recycling efforts in the county. Pike County Solid Waste officials reported that the county's recycling program diverted more than 450 tons of garbage from the landfill last year. More {{than half of the}} diverted material—254 tons—was cardboard. Approximately 158 tons of newspaper, 23 tons of <b>mixed</b> <b>paper,</b> 14 tons of plastic, three tons of phone books and one ton of white paper were also recycled instead of filling up the landfill.|$|E
50|$|Republic owns or {{operates}} 67 recycling centers. These facilities generate revenue {{through the}} processing {{and sale of}} old corrugated cardboard (OCC), old newspaper (ONP), aluminum, glass and other materials, which accounted for approximately 4% of their revenue during 2015. Approximately 70% of its recycling center volume relates to OCC, ONP and other <b>mixed</b> <b>paper.</b> Of the 5.1 million tons they sold during 2015, 2.5 million moved through its recycling centers and 2.6 million they collected and delivered to third parties. In partnership with the Alabama Coastal Foundation (ACF) Republic Services is launching an oyster shell collection program in 28 restaurants. Funded by a two-year grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, {{the goal of the}} collection program is to create sustainable oyster habitats and to teach the public about the importance of oyster shell recycling.|$|E

The recycling program has 100 percent tenant participation, and has reduced solid waste disposed by the complex by 40 percent since inception, with an estimated accumulated savings of $250,000.

5000|$|By 1989, the City {{had begun}} {{a series of}} new {{curbside}} pilot programs, collecting <b>mixed</b> <b>paper</b> and containers (glass, aluminum and plastic). [...] This program was fully operational by 1991, and contributed to San Francisco's achievement of 27 percent diversion in 1990. By 1997, the program had led to an additional 15,500 tons of recyclables diverted, yet, a 1996 waste characterization study illustrated additional opportunities for reaching AB939 goals. According to the study, 60,000 tons of unrecovered recyclables remained in the waste stream, 26 percent of which were food residuals. Because San Francisco is a dense city, yard waste was found to make up only 5 percent of the residential waste stream. These findings, in conjunction with AB939 diversion requirements, prompted San Francisco to develop new curbside recycling pilots that included the collection of food residuals.|$|E

Afterwards, more promising usage could be considered and developed such as repeated data collection using a same GPs' sample, long-term recording studies, usage of larger GPs' samples, etc...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} it is {{presented}} an equilibrium model, capable to predict {{the composition of the}} generated gas, its Lower Heating Value (LHV), the gasification efficiency, the ratio air/biomass and the  ratio gas/biomass in a downdraft gasifier. The model describes the influence of  the moisture content of the biomass and the gasification temperatures on the composition and properties of the produced gases, like the low heating value (LHV). It is assumed that all the chemical reactions taking place  in the gasification area are in thermodynamic equilibrium. The model doesn't considered tar formation. It is not considered formation of other hydrocarbons (CxHy) than methane. The types of biomass used for modelling are: sugarcane bagasse, paddy husk, pine sawdust, <b>mixed</b> <b>paper</b> waste and municipal solid waste. The effect of gasification temperature and moisture content of biomass over the gas composition has been also investigated. Also an exergo-economic analysis of cogeneration system forming by a downdraft gasifier associated to an internal combustion engine was carried out, using sugar cane bagasse, rice husk, and pine sawdust, as fuel in gasification processes. At 700 °C the highest amount of CO and CH 4 are produce. The amount of CH 4 and CO decrease with the temperature when the gasification temperature is increased from 700 °C to 1000 °C. The amount produced H 2 does change so much between the gasification at 700 °C and 1000 °C. But the amount produced hydrogen is somewhat higher at 800 °C. The lower heating value (LHV) of the synthesis gas from gasification of sugarcane bagasse the LHV of the produced gas is 4, 09 MJ/Nm 3; for gasification of pine the LHV of the produced gas is 5, 32 MJ/Nm 3; for gasification of rice husk the LHV of the produced gas is 3, 14 MJ/Nm 3, for gasification of <b>mixed</b> <b>paper</b> waste the LHV of the produced gas is 4, 51 %, and for gasification of municipal solid  waste the LHV of the produced gas is 3, 95 MJ/Nm 3. The cold and hot efficiency of gasification process at 800 °C for bagasse with 20 % moisture content are  55, 32 % and 84, 90 % respectively...|$|E
