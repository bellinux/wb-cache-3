40|$|Evaporative light-scattering {{detection}} (ELSD) {{is widely}} {{applied in the}} HPLC analysis of organic compounds lacking a UY chromophore. However, this detection method is generally unsuitable for determination of enantiomeric ratios (er). The er calculated from a UV trace and an ELS trace of the same compound differs significantly. Because of the nonlinear concentration response of the ELS detector, a compound with an er of 95 : 5 appears to be enantiomerically pure by ELS detection. It is possible to obtain a calibration curve and to calculate a correction factor, but this procedure is time consuming and therefore not very practical for routine analyses. In contrast, a charged <b>aerosol</b> <b>detector</b> allows a very accurate determination of the enantiomeric ratios. Like the ELS detection, the CA detection is independent of the chromophore properties of the substrate. Therefore, we recommend the use of CA instead of ELS detection for determination of the enantiomeric ratios of non-UV active compounds. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

In the discharge zone of the ionizer, the highest ion concentrations were found to be about 1. 71 × 1014 and 5. 09 × 1014 ions/m 3 for positive and negative coronas, respectively. At the outlet of the ionizer, it was found that the highest ion concentration was about 1. 95 × 1013 and 1. 91 × 1013 ions/m 3 for positive and negative coronas, respectively.

With the purpose of evaluating the applicability of CAD {{for the analysis of}} TCMs, an HPLC-CAD method for simultaneous determination of saponins in Radix et Rhizoma Notoginseng ("Sanqi'' in chinese) was established in this contribution, which was successfully applied for quantitation of seven saponins, notoginsenoside R- 1, ginsenosides Rg(1), Re, Rb- 1, Rg(2), Rh- 1, and Rd, in thirty batches of Sanqi samples. Meanwhile, the LODs and LOQs of UV, ELSD and CAD were compared and the results showed that the CAD method exhibited a lower LOD (0. 01 similar to 0. 15 mu g) and LOQ (0. 04 similar to 0. 41 mu g) than UV and ELSD. Furthermore, the CAD exhibited a steadier baseline in gradient elution compared with UV at 203 nm. Also, the HPLC-CAD method presents many apparent advantages of high sensitivity, steady baseline in gradient elution, easy operating, and it was expected to be a sensitive and universal method for analysis of TCMs containing weak UV absorption compounds. It was demonstrated that the content of seven saponins in Radix et Rhizoma Notoginseng did not significantly correlate with the original work nor with the conventional quality standard...|$|R
40|$|Recently a new {{detection}} method, {{based upon}} aerosol charging (the charged <b>aerosol</b> <b>detector</b> (CAD)) {{has been introduced}} {{as an alternative to}} evaporative light-scattering detector (ELSD), chemiluminescent nitrogen detector and refractive index detector for detection of non-ultraviolet and weakly ultraviolet active compounds and for UV-absorbing compounds in the absence of standards. The content of this review article includes description of operation principle, advantages and disadvantages of CAD system, and short reports of selected applications of this detector. The main advantages of CAD detector are unique performance characteristics: better sensitivity than ELSD system, a dynamic range of up to 4 orders of magnitude, ease of use and constancy of response factors. Both detectors are mass dependent and the response generated does not depend on the spectral or physicochemical properties of the analyte. This attractive feature of a detection technique generating universal response factors is the potential use of a single, universal standard for calibration against which all other compounds or impurities can be qualified. CAD also has the same limitation as ELSD, namely,the response is affected by mobile-phase composition. This problem has been resolved by using inverse gradient compensation as is done for high pressure liquid chromatography and supercritical fluid chromatography. CAD has been applied for the analysis of structurally diverse compounds used in the pharmaceutical, chemical, food, and consumer products industries and in life science research. They include nonvolatile and semivolatile neutral, acidic, basic, and zwitterionic compounds, both polar and nonpolar (e. g. lipids, proteins, steroids, polymers, carbohydrates, peptides) ...|$|R
40|$|Sanhuang Tablet (SHT) is a Chinese {{patented}} drug {{commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} inflammations of the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and skin. It contains a special medicinal composition including the single compound berberine hydrochloride, extracts of Scutellariae Radix and Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, as well as the powder of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma. Despite advances in analytical techniques, quantitative evaluation of a Chinese patented drug like SHT remains a challenge due to the complexity of its chemical profile. In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was used to simultaneously quantify 29 non-sugar small molecule components of SHT (11 flavonoids, two isoflavonoids, one flavanone, five anthraquinones, two dianthranones, five alkaloids, two organic acids and one stilbene). Three major saccharide components, namely fructose, glucose, and sucrose, were also quantitatively determined using high performance liquid chromatography-charged <b>aerosol</b> <b>detector</b> (HPLC-CAD) on an Asahipak NH 2 P- 50 4 E amino column. The established methods were validated in terms of linearity, sensitivity, precision, accuracy, and stability, and then successfully applied to analyze 27 batches of commercial SHT products. A total of up to 57. 61 % (w/w) of SHT could be quantified, in which the contents of the determined non-saccharide small molecules varied from 5. 91 % to 16. 83 % (w/w) and three saccharides accounted for 4. 41 % to 48. 05 % (w/w). The results showed that the quality of the commercial products was inconsistent, and only four of those met Chinese Pharmacopoeia criteria...|$|R
