5|$|Boron {{is rare in}} the Universe {{and solar}} system due to trace {{formation}} in the Big Bang and in stars. It is formed in minor amounts in cosmic ray spallation nucleosynthesis and may be found uncombined in cosmic dust and <b>meteoroid</b> materials.|$|E
5|$|It is {{suspected}} that comet impacts have, over long timescales, also delivered significant quantities {{of water to}} the Earth's Moon, {{some of which may}} have survived as lunar ice. Comet and <b>meteoroid</b> impacts are also thought to be responsible for the existence of tektites and australites.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meteoroids</b> in a {{retrograde}} {{orbit around the}} Sun hit the Earth with a faster relative speed than prograde <b>meteoroids</b> and tend to burn-up in the atmosphere {{and are more likely}} to hit the side of the Earth facing away from the Sun (i.e. at night) whereas the prograde <b>meteoroids</b> have slower closing speeds and more often land as meteorites and tend to hit the sun-facing side of the Earth. Most <b>meteoroids</b> are prograde.|$|R
40|$|The vast {{majority}} of <b>meteoroids</b> either {{fall to the ground}} as meteorites or ablate completely in the atmosphere. However, large <b>meteoroids</b> have been observed to pass through the atmosphere and reenter space in a few instances. These atmosphere-grazing <b>meteoroids</b> have been characterized using ground-based observation and satellite-based infrared detection. As these methods become more sensitive, smaller atmospheregrazing <b>meteoroids</b> will likely be detected. In anticipation of this increased detection rate, we compute the frequency with which centimeter-sized <b>meteoroids</b> graze and exit Earth's atmosphere. We characterize the post-atmosphere orbital characteristics of these bodies and conduct numerical simulations of their orbital evolution under the perturbing influence of the Sun and Moon. We find that a small subset of aerocaptured <b>meteoroids</b> are perturbed away from immediate atmospheric reentry and become temporary natural Earth satellites...|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{observations}} of meteors {{carried out in}} Dushanbe by the method of instantaneous exposure have shown clearly that <b>meteoroids</b> entering the Earth's atmosphere are subjected to different types of fragmentation. The quasi-continuous fragmentation of <b>meteoroids</b> is mostly widespread. Using the physical theory of meteors which {{takes into account the}} quasi-continuous fragmentation of <b>meteoroids</b> and on the basis of light curves of meteors the densities of <b>meteoroids</b> of different streams have been determined. The results enable us to conclude that the densities of <b>meteoroids</b> are over an order of magnitude higher than they have been assumed before. Moreover they are close to the densities of carbonaceous and ordinary chondrites...|$|R
5|$|The MESA {{failed to}} provide a stable work {{platform}} and was in shadow, slowing work somewhat. As they worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits, the integrated thermal <b>meteoroid</b> garment.|$|E
5|$|The <b>meteoroid</b> was not {{dangerous}} {{to life on}} Earth. Even if it had headed towards lower parts of the atmosphere it would have heated {{so much that it}} would have exploded high above the ground and only some small particles (meteorites) eventually might have made it to Earth's surface.|$|E
5|$|On 13 October 1990, <b>meteoroid</b> EN131090, with an {{estimated}} mass of 44kg, entered the Earth's atmosphere above Czechoslovakia and Poland and, after a few seconds, returned to space. Observations of such events are quite rare; {{this was the second}} recorded using scientific astronomical instruments (after the 1972Great Daylight Fireball) and the first recorded from two distant positions, which enabled the calculation of several of its orbital characteristics. The encounter with Earth significantly changed its orbit and, to a smaller extent, some of its physical properties (mass and structure of its outer layer).|$|E
40|$|Fragmentation {{characteristics}} {{for four}} artificial <b>meteoroids</b> of high density and {{high tensile strength}} with varying size, velocity, and material are investigated. The <b>meteoroids</b> analyzed were lifted to natural meteor altitude by a rocket vehicle system. The <b>meteoroids</b> were then accelerated back into the Earth's atmosphere at natural meteor velocities. Anomalous deceleration of high density meteors was studied. It is shown that anomalies in the deceleration are due to progressive fragmentation of the <b>meteoroids.</b> These anomalies in the deceleration of high density <b>meteoroids</b> {{are similar to the}} anomalies that occur in the deceleration of natural meteors, which are generally assumed to be porous and of weak structure...|$|R
25|$|Asteroids are {{differentiated}} from comets and <b>meteoroids.</b> In {{the case}} of comets, the difference is one of composition: while asteroids {{are mainly composed of}} mineral and rock, comets are composed of dust and ice. In addition, asteroids formed closer to the sun, preventing the development of the aforementioned cometary ice. The difference between asteroids and <b>meteoroids</b> is mainly one of size: <b>meteoroids</b> have a diameter of less than one meter, whereas asteroids have a diameter of greater than one meter. Finally, <b>meteoroids</b> can be composed of either cometary or asteroidal materials.|$|R
40|$|The {{spatial and}} orbital {{distributions}} of <b>meteoroids</b> of mass less than 10 to the - 8 g are discussed. Pioneer 8 and 9, HEOS- 2 and Helios 1 {{observations of the}} smallest <b>meteoroids</b> leaving the solar system in hyperbolic orbits due to radiation pressure (beta particles), intermediate mass particles arriving from the heliocentric spacecraft apex direction (alpha <b>meteoroids)</b> and the largest micrometeoroids observed with no preferred directionality (sporadic <b>meteoroids)</b> are reviewed, and evidence for the three groups of dynamically different micrometeoroids in lunar microcrater statistics is indicated. The collisional model {{of the origin of}} dust particles from the dispersion of sporadic <b>meteoroids</b> of cometary origin due to the Poynting-Robertson effect and collisions is then applied to account for the dynamics of the beta and alpha micrometeoroids...|$|R
5|$|The <b>meteoroid</b> grazed Earth's {{atmosphere}} quite gently (in comparison to, for example, the 1972Great Daylight Fireball {{above the}} United States and Canada). It became visible north of Uherský Brod, Czechoslovakia, at {{a height of}} 103.7km, approaching the Earth's surface to 98.67km northeast of Wrocław, Poland, and disappearing from sight at a height of 100.4km north of Poznań, Poland. It would probably still have been visible until it reached a height of 110km above the southern Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|A giant <b>meteoroid</b> {{approaches}} the earth, spotted from an observatory by Professor Decimus Phostle, while a self-proclaimed prophet, Philippulus, predicts {{the end of}} the world. The <b>meteoroid</b> misses the earth, but a fragment of it plunges into the Arctic Ocean. Phostle determines that the object is made of a new material which he names Phostlite, and sets off to find it with a crew of European scientists. Accompanied by Tintin and Snowy, their ship, the Aurora, is helmed by Tintin's friend Captain Haddock. Meanwhile, another team has set out aboard the polar expedition ship Peary, backed by the financier Mr. Bohlwinkel; wherefore, the expedition becomes a race to land on the meteorite. On the day of departure, Bohlwinkel has a henchman plant a stick of dynamite on the Aurora, but it is found and thrown overboard. In the North Sea, the Aurora is almost rammed by another of Bohlwinkel's ships, but Haddock steers out of the way. Further setbacks occur at the Icelandic port of Akureyri, when Haddock is informed that there is no fuel available. He and Tintin then come across an old friend of his, Captain Chester, who reveals that there is plenty of fuel and that the Golden Oil Company (which has a fuel monopoly) is owned by Bohlwinkel. The three then secretly run a hose from Chester's ship, Sirius, to the Aurora, and thus trick Golden Oil into providing the fuel they need.|$|E
5|$|Although entries of meteoroids into Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{are very}} common, recording a similar flight through the upper {{layers of the}} atmosphere is quite rare. Probably the first one reliably verified happened on 20 July 1860 above the American state of New York. The Czechoslovak–Polish fireball is sometimes compared to the 1972Great Daylight Fireball above Utah, the United States, and Alberta, Canada, {{which is the first}} scientifically observed and studied event of this type. The 1972 fireball was more than a thousand times as massive and it got 40km closer to Earth's surface. Observational data from both of them helped to develop a method for computing the grazing trajectories of such bodies, which was later used when calculating the trajectory of another Earth-grazing <b>meteoroid,</b> observed on 29 March 2006 above Japan.|$|E
40|$|The {{concentration}} of <b>meteoroids</b> of mass about 0. 01 microgram in interplanetary space, in the asteroid belt, and near Jupiter has been measured. The data confirm the Pioneer 10 {{observation that the}} asteroid belt is not highly populated with small <b>meteoroids,</b> suggest that the high {{concentration of}} small particles around Jupiter {{is the result of}} gravitational focusing, and provide an indication of the mass distribution of <b>meteoroids</b> in interplanetary space...|$|R
40|$|<b>Meteoroids</b> {{originating}} {{from the local}} interstellar medium, traverse the solar system. This has been proven by in situ measurements by interplanetary spacecraft as well as highly sensitive radar measurements. Early attempts to detect interstellar <b>meteoroids</b> using the instruments on board the Pioneer 8 and 9 spacecraft failed. More sensitive detectors on board the joint ESA/NASA mission Ulysses {{as well as on}} board the NASA spacecraft Galileo, however, unambiguously detected <b>meteoroids</b> of interstellar origin. This discovery has started efforts to compare the results from the in situ measurements with highly sophisticated models of interstellar dust properties derived from astronomical absorption and extinction measurements. It was found that, at least locally, is more mass locked up in <b>meteoroids</b> than expected from the astronomical measurements. So far the in situ measurements only allow to derive composition information indirectly via the <b>meteoroid’s</b> dynamics. Key words: dust; interstellar; in-situ measurements...|$|R
40|$|Operational {{spacecraft}} in Earth orbit or on interplanetary trajectories {{are exposed}} to high-velocity particles that can cause damage to sensitive on-board instrumentation. Asteroids and Comets produce small solid particles as they disintegrate. The <b>meteoroids</b> stay on bound orbits around the Sun if they are larger than a few micrometres in size. Because of their high velocities they create different kinds of hazards to operational spacecraft. Here we discuss the impact hazards that lead to surface degradation, hull penetration, and plasma discharge. Surface degradation is mainly caused by <b>meteoroids</b> in the 0. 01 to 0. 1 mm range, hull penetration by <b>meteoroids</b> above 1 mm, and plasma discharge by <b>meteoroids</b> between 1 and 10 μm...|$|R
5|$|Cassini {{photographs}} {{have led}} to other significant discoveries. They have revealed a previously undiscovered planetary ring, outside the brighter main rings of Saturn and inside the G and Erings. The source of this ring is hypothesized to be the crashing of a <b>meteoroid</b> off Janus and Epimetheus. In July 2006, Cassini images provided evidence of hydrocarbon lakes near Titan's north pole, the presence of which were confirmed in January 2007. In March 2007, additional images near Titan's north pole revealed hydrocarbon seas, the largest of which is almost {{the size of the}} Caspian Sea. In October 2006, the probe detected an 8,000km diameter cyclone-like storm with an eyewall at Saturn's south pole.|$|E
5|$|The <b>meteoroid</b> was a typeI fireball, i.e. an {{ordinary}} chondrite. When it entered Earth's atmosphere its mass was about 44kg, which was estimated {{on the basis}} of the measured values of its absolute magnitude and velocity. It lost approximately 350g during the encounter. Computer simulations showed that it started losing mass approximately at the moment it became visible to the cameras of the European Fireball Network, at a height of 100.6km. It lost mass for 25 seconds, until it reached a height of 215.7km. Its surface melted and solidified again after leaving, which means its surface became a typical meteoritic fusion crust.|$|E
5|$|Reported {{details about}} the event, such as water boiling in the muddy crater for ten minutes from {{the heat of the}} impact, {{presented}} a problem for experts. Because the impact site is at a high altitude of more than , the <b>meteoroid</b> may not have been slowed down as much as it ordinarily would have been by passage through the Earth’s denser lower atmosphere, and kinetic energy at impact may have been unusually high for a terrestrial impact of an object of this size and mass. Most larger meteorites are cold in their bulk mass when they land on Earth, since their heated outer layers ablate from the objects before impacting. It was later confirmed that the meteorite contained a large amount of iron and possessed magnetic properties common to similar metallic objects, which contributed to its capacity to retain heat during atmospheric entry.|$|E

[...] Some <b>meteoroids</b> ejected from the Moon get launched into orbits around the Sun. [...] These <b>meteoroids</b> remain in space longer, but eventually intersect the Earth's orbit and land.|$|R
40|$|Hypervelocity {{impact tests}} were {{conducted}} to simulate the damage that <b>meteoroids</b> will produce in the Shuttle Orbiter leading edge structural subsystem material.

5|$|The {{survey work}} {{leading to the}} {{discovery}} of Styx was in preparation for the mission of the unmanned New Horizons spaceprobe, which flew by the Pluto system on 14 July 2015. The discovery of another small Plutonian moon heightened concerns that this region of space may harbor more bodies too small to be detected, and that the probe could be damaged by an uncharted body or ring as it traversed the system at a speed of over 13km/s; tiny moons, such as Saturn's moon Pallene, tend to be associated with tenuous rings or arcs, because their gravity is unable to hold on to material ejected by <b>meteoroid</b> impacts; such diffuse material represents the chief navigational hazard. However, the New Horizons probe did not detect any smaller moons or rings, and passed through the Pluto system safely.|$|E

40|$|Opportunities for {{transfer}} of twenty Geminid <b>meteoroids</b> from Phaethon were found by integrating the {{equations of motion}} back in time along with Phaethon. Examination of the conditions {{for transfer}} show that the <b>meteoroids</b> could have been ejected under circumstances (location, speed and directions of ejection) that are possible or even expected during cometary activity. Phaethon's active period {{would be no more}} than 2000 years ago and may have been within the last 600 years.

40|$|By {{analyzing}} high-accuracy Leonid orbits {{obtained from}} multiple-station meteor observations during the 1998 outburst and 1999 storm, we have detected {{the presence of}} <b>meteoroids</b> with peculiar orbits. These <b>meteoroids</b> are characterized by having a geocentric radiant nearly identical {{to the members of}} the storm that appeared with them but showing different orbital elements owing to their lower geocentric velocities. The changes in some orbital elements are significant and allow us to interpret the cause of such differences. Mainly, the semimajor axis and the eccentricity of these anomalous orbits are lower than expected for members of the dust trail or members coming from the background component linked to the annual stream. From these characteristics it is likely that these peculiar <b>meteoroids</b> suffered some perturbations on very short timescales. We have investigated several causes, including planetary perturbations, collisions, and radiative effects in order to explain the observed orbital changes. We conclude that these orbital changes can be explained by the loss of orbital energy close to the ecliptic plane. Such an effect can only be explained clearly by collisions of the original <b>meteoroids</b> with dust particles associated with the zodiacal dust cloud. We have applied this hypothesis in order to constrain some physical properties of 55 P/ Tempel-Tuttle cometary <b>meteoroids.</b> Subject heading: meteors, <b>meteoroids</b> — comets: individual (55 P/Tempel-Tuttle) 1...|$|R
