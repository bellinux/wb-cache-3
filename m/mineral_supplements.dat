5|$|The average modern horse on good hay or pasture {{with light}} work usually {{does not need}} supplements; however, horses {{subjected}} to stress due to age, intensive athletic work, or reproduction may need additional nutrition. Extra fat and protein are sometimes added to the horse's diet, along with vitamin and <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements.</b> There are hundreds, if not thousands of commercially prepared vitamin and <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements</b> on the market, many tailored to horses with specialized needs.|$|E
5|$|Other than forage, {{the other}} staple feed for sheep is hay, often {{during the winter}} months. The ability to thrive solely on pasture (even without hay) varies with breed, but all sheep can survive on this diet. Also {{included}} in some sheep's diets are minerals, either in a trace mix or in licks. Feed provided to sheep must be specially formulated, as most cattle, poultry, pig, and even some goat feeds contain levels of copper that are lethal to sheep. The same danger applies to <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements</b> such as salt licks.|$|E
5|$|First {{reported}} in 2003, {{the idea of}} using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (approximately 1:1) {{does not need to be}} consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10g per day in children or 20g per day in adults, and are increased to 20–30g per day after a month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements</b> and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} encountered in livestock farming in the area aside from the high rainfall is that limestone grassland is low in some minerals necessary for grazing animals in the winter such as copper, selenium, phosphorus and magnesium. Throughout the winter months, the cattle are kept indoors and fed on a diet of silage, hay and some <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements.</b>|$|E
25|$|After surgery, {{patients}} feel fullness after ingesting {{only a small}} {{volume of}} food, followed soon thereafter {{by a sense of}} satiety and loss of appetite. Total food intake is markedly reduced. Due to the reduced size of the newly created stomach pouch, and reduced food intake, adequate nutrition demands that the patient follow the surgeon's instructions for food consumption, including the number of meals to be taken daily, adequate protein intake, and the use of vitamin and <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements.</b> Calcium supplements, iron supplements, protein supplements, multi-vitamins (sometimes pre-natal vitamins are best), and vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) supplements are all very important to the post-operative bypass patient.|$|E
25|$|While {{a healthy}} diet is beneficial, the effect of {{antioxidant}} supplementation (vitamin E, vitamin C, etc.) or vitamins has not been shown to protect against cardiovascular disease {{and in some cases}} may possibly result in harm. <b>Mineral</b> <b>supplements</b> have also not been found to be useful. Niacin, a type of vitamin B3, may be an exception with a modest decrease in the risk of cardiovascular events in those at high risk. Magnesium supplementation lowers high blood pressure in a dose dependent manner. Magnesium therapy is recommended for people with ventricular arrhythmia associated with torsades de pointes who present with long QT syndrome {{as well as for the}} treatment of people with digoxin intoxication-induced arrhythmias. There is no evidence to support omega-3 fatty acid supplementation.|$|E

500|$|In most single-tablet, over-the-counter, daily vitamin and <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements,</b> zinc is {{included}} in such forms as zinc oxide, zinc acetate, or zinc gluconate.

[...] As such, it may protect against accelerated aging of the skin and muscles of the body; studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc also helps speed up the healing process after an injury. Zinc deficiency compromises the human immune system.|$|E
500|$|Donkeys do {{best when}} allowed to consume {{small amounts of}} food over long periods, as is natural for them in an arid climate. They can meet their {{nutritional}} needs on 6 to 7 hours of grazing per day on average dryland pasture that is not stressed by drought. If they are worked long hours or {{do not have access}} to pasture, they require hay or a similar dried forage, with no more than a 1:4 ratio of legumes to grass. [...] They also require salt and <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements,</b> and access to clean, fresh water. [...] Like ponies and mules, in a lush climate, donkeys are prone to obesity and are at risk of laminitis.|$|E
500|$|Many feed {{manufacturers}} combine various {{grains and}} add additional vitamin and <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements</b> {{to create a}} complete premixed feed that is easy for owners to feed and of predictable nutritional quality.

Grain mixes with added molasses are usually called [...] "sweet feed" [...] in the United States and [...] "coarse mix" [...] in the United Kingdom. Pelleted or extruded feeds (sometimes referred to as [...] "nuts" [...] in the UK) may be easier to chew and result in less wasted feed. Horses generally eat pellets as easily as grain. However, pellets are also more expensive, and even [...] "complete" [...] rations do not eliminate the necessity for forage.|$|E

2500|$|A horse or pony needs {{approximately}} 1.5% to 2.5% of {{its body}} weight in food per day, depending on its age and level of work. This may include forages such as grass or hay and concentrates such as grain or commercially prepared pelleted feeds. Best practice is to feed horses small quantities multiple times daily, unless they are on full-time pasture. Fresh, clean water should be provided free choice at all times, {{unless there is a}} specific reason to limit water intake {{for a short period of}} time. [...] Some horse owners add vitamin or <b>mineral</b> <b>supplements,</b> some with nutraceutical ingredients that offer many different benefits.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to verify the effect of low-intake supplementation on performance of Nellore young bulls kept on Marandu grass pasture. The experiment was divided in two periods: the dry and rainy seasons. Treatments during the dry period were composed of mineral salt with urea and <b>mineral</b> <b>supplement</b> enriched with true protein and additive. In the rainy period treatments were mineral salt and enriched <b>mineral</b> <b>supplement</b> only. Pastures were evaluated and animals were weighed in both evaluation phases. The variables studied were evaluated in a completely randomized design in a split-plot arrangement, where plots were treatments and subplots were the periods within each phase, considering the types of supplementation as treatments. During the dry season there was no effect of supplement type in the first and second periods of assessment on weight gain of animals, which was of 0. 307 and 0. 113 kg/day, respectively. In the third period of this phase there was effect of the type of supplementation on animal performance; animals which received enriched <b>mineral</b> <b>supplement</b> gained 0. 600 kg/day vs. 0. 517 kg/day for those which received mineral salt with urea. In the rainy season, animals receiving enriched <b>mineral</b> <b>supplement</b> gained more weight than animals receiving mineral supplement: 0. 800 and 0. 696 kg/day, respectively. Mineral supplementation with addition of protein and additives provides increases in the weight gains of animals kept at a grazing regime of 15 %...|$|R
