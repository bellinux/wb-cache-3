5000|$|Beta {{attenuation}} monitoring (BAM) is {{a widely}} used air <b>monitoring</b> <b>technique</b> employing the absorption of beta radiation by solid particles extracted from air flow. This technique allows {{for the detection of}} PM10 and PM2.5, which are monitored as standards by most air pollution regulatory agencies. The main principle is based on a kind of Bouguer (Lambert-Beer) law: the amount by which the flow of beta radiation (electrons) is attenuated by a solid matter is exponentially dependent on its mass and not on any other feature (such as density, chemical composition or some optical or electrical properties) of this matter. So, the air is drawn from outside of the detector through an [...] "infinite" [...] (cycling) ribbon made from some filtering material so that the particles are collected on it. There are two sources of beta radiation placed one before and one after the region where air flow passes through the ribbon leaving particles on it; and there are also two detectors {{on the opposite side of}} the ribbon, facing the detectors. The sources' intensity and detectors' sensitivity being the same (or corrected with appropriate calibration lookup table), the intensity of beta rays detected by one of detectors is compared to that of the other. Thus one can deduce how much mass has the ribbon acquired upon being exposed to air flow; knowing the drain velocity, actual particle mass concentration in air could be assessed.|$|E

5000|$|The voltage-frequency {{relationship}} for the chip {{can also be}} determined by using another approach in which a critical path monitor tries to model the critical path of the chip.The critical path of the system can be duplicated using a ring oscillator or by a fanout of four Ring oscillator or a delay line. This critical path replica (delay line [...] )provides the closest behavior to the actual critical path except for the intra-die variations and cross coupling capacitances which are hard to duplicate. This delay line adapts to environmental and process variations. As the actual performance of the core and {{the speed of the}} delay line are directly related, a closed-loop adaptive voltage scaling system is obtained to automatically adjust the supply voltage such that the minimum needed voltage is supplied so as to perform the target task.The delay chain consists of inverters, NAND gates, wire segments,etc., and the output can be tapped from one of the points, thus allowing tuning of the delay to match chips critical path. A reconfigurable delay chain can also be used in a critical path <b>monitoring</b> <b>technique.</b> It is during the manufacturing test, the exact setting of the delay chain is determined. During the AVS operation, in order to measure the delay launch an edge {{at the start of the}} clock cycle and then capture the edge at the end of the clock cycle at the output of delay chain and a set of buffers. Then the buffer outputs that are captured are analyzed to determine the exact positioning of the rising edge. Now the feedback employed by the AVS system continually adjusts the supply voltage such that the delay chain and critical path meet the timing constraints with adequate margins. The adjustment of supply voltage is done such that the launched rising edge makes it to a specified buffer stage which ensures the timing of delay line.|$|E

The required information about dynamic behaviors of the formal specification and concrete implementation of a target system is obtained from the animator and the debugger.
