However, for {{mobile computing}} to be successful, an obvious layer, the MAC layer, <b>must</b> <b>be</b> efficient <b>in</b> channel <b>access</b> and reservation. Therefore, in-depth understanding is needed of the wireless MAC layer if wireless computing is to takeoff. Many random access wireless MAC protocols have been proposed and even standardized. However, there has yet been an attempt to understand why certain designs are used and what makes certain protocols better than others. In this paper, we survey several popular, contemporary, wireless, random access MAC protocols and determine the effects behind the design choices of these protocols...|$|R

In this context, {{the use of}} femtocells, i. e., cells with very limited coverage area, has <b>been</b> proposed. <b>In</b> this paper, a femtocell network with hybrid access control mode is considered. The activity profile of the Femtocell Users (FUs) is modeled to compute the maximum achievable throughput and the consumed energy per successfully transmitted data bit by the Macrocell Users (MUs), depending on which set of channels <b>are</b> operated <b>in</b> open <b>access</b> mode, i. e., which channels {{can be used by}} MUs. Thus, it is identified how many and which channels <b>must</b> <b>be</b> operated <b>in</b> open <b>access</b> mode, depending on the physical capacities of the channels and the amount of time these channels are not occupied by FUs. The results motivate the need for novel resource management schemes which can dynamically adapt the set of open access channels to the network conditions. I...|$|R

40|$|Hash {{tables are}} {{fundamental}} components of several network processing algorithms and applications, including route lookup, packet classification, per-flow state management and network monitoring. These applications, which typically {{occur in the}} data-path of high-speed routers, must process and forward packets {{with little or no}} buffer, making it important to maintain wire-speed throughout. A poorly designed hash table can critically affect the worst-case throughput of an application, since the number of memory accesses required for each lookup can vary. Hence, high throughput applications require hash tables with more predictable worst-case lookup performance. While published papers often assume that hash table lookups take constant time, there <b>is</b> significant variation <b>in</b> the number of items that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>accessed</b> <b>in</b> a typical hash table search, leading to search times that vary by a factor of four or more.

Web click stream analysis and detection of network intrusions are two examples.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} model-checking {{algorithm}} {{which can be}} used to evaluate access control policies, and a tool which implements it. The evaluation includes not only assessing whether the policies give legitimate users enough permissions to reach their goals, but also checking whether the policies prevent intruders from reaching their malicious goals. Policies of the access control system and goals of agents <b>must</b> <b>be</b> described <b>in</b> the <b>access</b> control description and specification language introduced as in our earlier work. The algorithm takes a policy description and a goal as input and performs two modes of checking. In the assessing mode, the algorithm searches for strategies consisting of reading and writing steps which allow the agents to achieve their goals no matter what states the system may be driven into during the execution of the strategies. In the intrusion detection mode, a weaker notion of strategy is used, reflecting the willingness of intruders to guess the value of attributes which they cannot read...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Harvard architecture computer, the Harvard Mark I, employed entirely separate memory {{systems to}} store instructions and data. The CPU fetched the next instruction and loaded or stored data simultaneously and independently. This <b>is</b> <b>in</b> {{contrast to a}} Von Neumann architecture computer, in which both instructions and data <b>are</b> stored <b>in</b> the same memory system and (without the complexity of a CPU cache) <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>accessed</b> <b>in</b> turn. The physical separation of instruction and data memory is sometimes held to be the distinguishing feature of modern Harvard architecture computers. With microcontrollers (entire computer systems integrated onto single chips), the use of different memory technologies for instructions (e.g. flash memory) and data (typically read/write memory) in von Neumann machines is becoming popular. The true distinction of a Harvard machine is that instruction and data memory occupy different address spaces. In other words, a memory address does not uniquely identify a storage location (as it does in a Von Neumann machine); {{you also need to}} know the memory space (instruction or data) to which the address belongs.|$|R

The distribution and sharing by the Web of information that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>accessed</b> <b>in</b> a selective way requires the definition and enforcement of security controls, ensuring that information will be accessible only to authorized entities.

40|$|Bitmap {{indexing}} is {{a common}} technique for indexing high-dimensional data in data warehouses and scientific applications. Though efficient for low-cardinality attributes, query processing can be rather costly for high-cardinality attributes due to the large storage requirements for the bitmap indices. Binning {{is a common}} technique for reducing storage costs of bitmap indices. This technique partitions the attribute values {{into a number of}} ranges, called bins, and uses bitmap vectors to represent bins (attribute ranges) rather than distinct values. Although binning may reduce storage costs, it may increase the access costs of queries that do not fall on exact bin boundaries (edge bins). For this kind of queries the original data values associated with edge bins <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>accessed,</b> <b>in</b> order to check them against the query constraints. In this paper we study the problem of finding optimal locations for the bin boundaries in order to minimize these access costs subject to storage constraints. We propose a dynamic programming algorithm for optimal partitioning of attribute values into bins that takes into account query access patterns as well as data distribution statistics. Mathematical analysis and experiments on real life data sets show that the optimal partitioning achieved by this algorithm can lead to a significant improvement <b>in</b> the <b>access</b> costs of bitmap indexing systems for high-cardinality attributes...|$|R

The distribution and sharing of information via the Web that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>accessed</b> <b>in</b> a selective way, such as electronic commerce transactions, require the definition and enforcement of security controls, ensuring that information will be accessible only to authorized entities. Different approaches have been proposed that {{address the problem of}} protecting information in a Web system. However, these approaches typically operate at the file-system level, independently of the data that have to be protected from unauthorized accesses. Part of this problem is due to the limitations of HTML, historically used to design Web documents. The extensible markup language (XML), a markup language promoted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W 3 C), is de facto the standard language for the exchange of information on the Internet and represents an important opportunity to provide fine-grained access control. We present an access control model to protect information distributed on the Web that, by exploiting XML’s own capabilities, allows the definition and enforcement of access restrictions directly on the structure and content of the documents. We present a language for the specification of access restrictions, which uses standard notations and concepts, together with a description of a system architecture for access control enforcement based on existing technology.

5000|$|Another {{topic that}} has been given some {{attention}} <b>is</b> differences <b>in</b> processing of homophones. Verdonschot et al. examined differences {{in the time it}} took to read a homophone out loud when a picture that was either related or unrelated [...] to a homophonic character was presented before the character. Both Japanese and Chinese homophones were examined. Whereas word production of alphabetic languages (such as English) has shown a relatively robust immunity to the effect of context stimuli, [...] Verdschot et al. found that Japanese homophones seem particularly sensitive to these types of effects. Specifically, reaction times were shorter when participants were presented with a phonologically related picture before being asked to read a target character out loud. An example of a phonologically related stimulus from the study would be for instance when participants were presented with a picture of an elephant, which <b>is</b> pronounced ‘zou’ <b>in</b> Japanese, before being presented with the character 造, which is also read 'zou'. No effect of phonologically related context pictures were found for the reaction times for reading Chinese words. A comparison of the logographic languages Japanese and Chinese is interesting because whereas the Japanese language consists of more than 60% homographic heterophones (characters that can be read two or more different ways) most Chinese characters only have one reading. Because both languages are logographic the difference in latency in reading aloud Japanese and Chinese due to context effects cannot be ascribed to the logographic nature of the languages. Instead, the authors hypothesize that the difference <b>in</b> latency times <b>is</b> due to additional processing costs in Japanese, where the reader cannot rely solely on a direct orthography to phonology route, but information on a lexical-syntactical level <b>must</b> also <b>be</b> <b>accessed</b> <b>in</b> order to choose the correct pronunciation. This hypothesis is corroborated by studies finding that Japanese Alzheimer’s patient whose comprehension of characters was deteriorated still could read the words out loud with no particular difficulty.|$|R
