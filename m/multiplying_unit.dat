MethodsA prospective study. The subjects were members of Internet panels in the United States (US) and Germany. 10, 816 individuals (United States: n = 5410; Germany: n = 5406) aged 30 – 70 years with BMI scores between 20 and 35 kg/m 2 were recruited and grouped by category: healthy weight (BMI 20 – 24. 9 kg/m 2), overweight (BMI 25 – 29. 9 kg/m 2), and obese (BMI 30 – 35 kg/m 2). Within the overweight and obese categories, the individuals were stratified by sex and within those subgroups, characterized as above or below the median WC. The subjects self-reported weight, WC, and health-care resource use at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months using online questionnaires. Over 65 % of the recruited subjects completed all surveys. Resource utilization was translated into health-care costs by <b>multiplying</b> <b>unit</b> costs from national sources in each country. Annualized health costs were summarized for subjects with low and high WC within the overweight and obese categories. A two-part model generated predicted annual costs because of the WC difference controlling for BMI, demographic, and lifestyle variables among the overweight and obese subjects. ResultsWhen BMI and other characteristics are constant, annual health-care costs are 16 % to 18 % higher in Germany and 20 % to 30 % higher in the United States for the subjects with a high WC compared with subjects with a low WC. ConclusionsTargeting people with a high waist circumference for weight management whether they are overweight or obese may maximize cost-efficacy...|$|E

Such damage requires renovation in order to restore the building performance and function. This research analyzed the renovation cost analysis for Panti Rapih Nursing Academy in Sleman Regency, Yogyakarta. This research related to building advisability after shaked by earthquacke based on the Condition Index. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) {{was used for the}} analysis. Based on this method, the building Condition Index depends on two parameters. The first parameter is building component and sub component weight. The second is the damage degree and quantity, which was obtained by onsite visual assessment. This research included the analysis of renovation cost completed with factors influencing the cost based on the degree of the damage. The renovation cost was calculated by <b>multiplying</b> <b>unit</b> cost and quantity of works, which was obtained from onsite results of the direct survey. The unit cost used refered to official cost in Regency of Sleman, Yogyakarta. Finally, the result obtained were then compared to the cost computed by contractor. Analysis results showed that the Condition Index of Nursing Academy Building was 93, 5394 %, which was within low damages category. In theory, the cost to restore the building Condition Index (back to 100 %) was Rp. 73. 160. 000, 00. This amount was lower than the real cost of Rp 97. 680. 000, 00 calculated by the contractor. Such difference {{may be due to the}} different method used when calculating the quantity and unit cost of works...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background While South Africa spends {{approximately}} 7. 4 % of GDP on healthcare, only 43 % {{of these}} funds are {{spent in the}} public system, which is tasked with the provision of care {{to the majority of}} the population including a large proportion of those in need of antiretroviral treatment (ART). South Africa is currently debating the introduction of a National Health Insurance (NHI) system. Because such a universal health system could mean increased public healthcare funding and improved access to human resources, it could improve the sustainability of ART provision. This paper considers the minimum resources that would be required to achieve the proposed universal health system and contrasts these with the costs of scaled up access to ART between 2010 and 2020. Methods The costs of ART and universal coverage (UC) are assessed through <b>multiplying</b> <b>unit</b> costs, utilization and estimates of the population in need during each year of the planning cycle. Costs are from the provider’s perspective reflected in real 2007 prices. Results The annual costs of providing ART increase from US$ 1 billion in 2010 to US$ 3. 6 billion in 2020. If increases in funding to public healthcare only keep pace with projected real GDP growth, then close to 30 % of these resources would be required for ART by 2020. However, an increase in the public healthcare resource envelope from 3. 2 % to 5 %- 6 % of GDP would be sufficient to finance both ART and other services under a universal system (if based on a largely public sector model) and the annual costs of ART would not exceed 15 % of the universal health system budget. Conclusions Responding to the HIV-epidemic is one of the many challenges currently facing South Africa. Whether this response becomes a “resource for democracy” or whether it undermines social cohesiveness within poor communities and between rich and poor communities will be partially determined by the steps that are taken during the next ten years. While the introduction of a universal system will be complex, it could generate a health system responsive to the needs of all South Africans. </p...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{low-power}} synthesis {{technique is}} presented {{for the design}} of folded or time-multiplexed programmable-coefficient FIR filters where storage area is traded-off for lowering power consumption. A systematic technique is developed for low power mapping of FIR filters to architectures with arbitrary number of multipliers and adders. Power consumed in multipliers is reduced by reducing switching activity at both the data-input as well as the coefficient input. In order to increase common inputs to multipliers the transpose-form representation of the FIR filter is used. As opposed to the direct-form the transpose-form representation exposes common data inputs of a filter in an explicit manner. Switching activity at the data-input is reduced by first unfolding the FIR filter and then mapping the words with same input signal to a <b>multiplier</b> <b>unit.</b> Within each <b>multiplier</b> <b>unit</b> the switching activity for the coefficient input is further reduced by using a traveling salesperson problem (TSP) [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master thesis work is {{to reduce}} the leakage power of the FlexCore {{processor}} by applying {{one of the most effective}} leakage reduction techniques, power gating. The main principle of this technique is inserting transistors named power switches, to cut off voltage supply of the functional units when they are not in use. In the context of this thesis, <b>multiplier</b> <b>unit</b> of the FlexCore processor, a novel architecture for embedded systems, is selected to be power gated. This is because, initial studies show that the multiplier, due to its relatively large size and significant idle time leads to it being a major contributor to the leakage power dissipation. A process of applying power gating onto the FlexCore's multiplier is divided into two parallel branches, software analysis and hardware implementation, and concluded in an integration phase. The software analysis phase, using FlexTools tool-chain, involves profiling of two EEMBC benchmarks and extending of the Native Instruction Set Architecture (N-ISA) to adopt control bits that are enable to activate or deactivate the <b>multiplier</b> <b>unit</b> on demand. The hardware implementation phase focuses on the implementation of the power gating technique by using power specification which is defined in the Common Power Format (CPF) at both RTL level and physical level. In the final phase, the extended N-ISA instruction is applied on the FlexCore processor with power gated <b>multiplier</b> <b>unit</b> to estimate the power reduction at a small area cost. During the physical implementation phase, the optimal power savings were estimated taking in to account the overhead from the switches.
