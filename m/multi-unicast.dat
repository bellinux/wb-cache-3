As such, given {{maximum transmission unit}} limitations, Xcast cannot be used for multicast groups with many destinations. The Xcast model generally assumes that stations participating in the communication are known ahead of time, so that distribution trees can be generated and resources allocated by network elements in advance of actual data traffic.|$|E
50|$|The {{explicit}} <b>multi-unicast</b> (Xcast) is {{a variation}} of multicast that supports {{a great number of}} multicast sessions with a small number of recipients in each. It adds all the destination IP addresses in the IP header, instead of using a multicast address. The traditional multicast schemes over Internet Protocol (IP) scale to multicast groups with many members, but they have scalability problems for a great number of groups.Multicast schemes can be used to minimize the bandwidth consumption. Xcast minimizes bandwidth consumption for small groups, by eliminating the signaling protocols and state information for every session of the standard IP multicast scheme..|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Network coding is {{considered}} as a promising tech-nique to improve diversity gain and network throughput in multi-source relay systems. This paper presents an opportunistic network coded cooperation scheme in wireless <b>multi-unicast</b> system with non-ideal source-relay channels. In the conventional network-coding-based cooperation schemes, the relay merges the messages received from multiple sources and always forwards them to the destinations without checking their reception status. The destinations recover the sources ’ messages either from the direct transmissions or from the relay forwarding. Such mode is easy to implement, but may lead to error propagation {{in the event of}} decoding failures at relay. In contrast to these works, the proposed scheme is opportunistic, where the relay forwarding is determined by the quality of S → R channels, that is, the relay does not assist transmission unless it has correctly decoded the received sources ’ messages. Systematic performance analysis in the form of outage probability and spectral efficiency is performed in this paper. Comparisons with the conventional network coded <b>multi-unicast</b> and Incremental Relaying protocol are made under a fixed system energy constraint. The outage results show that the proposed scheme performs better than the conventional network-coded schemes when source-relay links has poor quality. Comparing with Incremental Relaying protocol, the opportunistic scheme achieves a reduced system outage probability as well as a higher spectral efficiency. This scenario can be extended to general multi-user environment without much cost.

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of network {{applications}} {{require the use of}} reliable multicast protocols to disseminate data from one source to a potentially large number of receivers simultaneously. We focus on multicast in single channel multi-access wireless networks and consider Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) based error control algorithms. We propose a simple NACK based method, called overlapped NACKs, that exploits the physical nature of the transmitted NACK signals in order to achieve a high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) even in the presence of NACK collisions. As an example, we apply the proposed method to Bluetooth, quantify its reliability and compare the achievable throughput with respect to the <b>multi-unicast</b> case and to an ACK based protocol. Results show that the overlapped NACK method has the potential to substantially increase the throughput over the ACK based protocol and provides good reliability...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Comparing {{with the}} unicast technology, {{multiple}} {{flows from the}} same source in multicast scenario can be aggregat-ed even if their destinations are different. This paper evaluates such distinction by the multicast gain on per-node capacity and delay, which are defined as the per-node capacity and delay ratios between <b>multi-unicast</b> and multicast (m destinations for each multicast session). Particularly, the restricted mobility model [1] is proposed, which is a representative mobility model characterizing a class of mobility models with different average moving speeds. The theoretical analysis of this model indicates that the mobility significantly decreases the multicast gain on per-node capacity and delay, though the per-node capacity of both unicast and multicast can be enhanced by mobility. This finding suggests that mobility weakens the distinction between multicast and unicast. Finally, a general framework of multicast study is constituted by analyzing the upper-bound (Θ(m)), the lower-bound (Θ(1)) and the main determinants of the multicast gain on both per-node capacity and delay regardless of mobility model...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Currently, IP {{multicast}} and Explicit <b>Multi-Unicast</b> (Xcast) are {{two approaches}} for multicast communications. IP multicast {{is designed for}} large groups but is not scalable {{in terms of the}} group number because every router in a multicast tree needs to store the forwarding state for each group. In contrast, Xcast is designed for small groups and is not scalable in terms of the group size because each packet’s header can include only the addresses of a few receivers. Therefore, the two approaches are designed for different scenarios and address different problems. However, the selection of IP multicast or Xcast is left to end users who will choose the corresponding API in the applications. In other words, the scalability of the network relies on the end users, and is not guaranteed by the protocol itself. In this paper, we address the above issues and propose a multicasting protocol that is scalable and adaptive in terms of both group number and group size. We avoid the disadvantages of IP multicast and Xcast by choosing only a few routers to store the forwarding states, and multicast packets are delivered via Xcast among these routers. The main advantage of our protocol is that the assignment of forwarding states is optimal and performed in a fully distributed manner. We show that IP multicast and Xcast are two extreme and special cases of our approach. We prove that the overhead of our protocol is limited. In addition, the assignment of forwarding states in our protocol is adaptive to the dynamic group membership and the change in network topology. Moreover, our protocol is simple and can be extended from existing multicast routing protocols...|$|E
40|$|Living in an {{increasingly}} networked world, with an abundant number of services available to consumers, the consumer electronics market is enjoying a boom. The average consumer {{in the developed world}} may own several networked devices such as games consoles, mobile phones, PDAs, laptops and desktops, wireless picture frames and printers to name but a few. With this growing number of networked devices comes a growing demand for services, defined here as functions requested by a client and provided by a networked node. For example, a client may wish to download and share music or pictures, find and use printer services, or lookup information (e. g. train times, cinema bookings). It is notable that a significant proportion of networked devices are now mobile. Mobile devices introduce a new dynamic to the service discovery problem, such as lower battery and processing power and more expensive bandwidth. Device owners expect to access services not only in their immediate proximity, but further afield (e. g. in their homes and offices). Solving these problems is the focus of this research. This Thesis offers two alternative approaches to service discovery in Wide Area Networks (WANs). Firstly, a unique combination of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the OSGi middleware technology is presented to provide both mobility and service discovery capability in WANs. Through experimentation, this technique is shown to be successful where the number of operating domains is small, but it does not scale well. To address the issue of scalability, this Thesis proposes the use of Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) service overlays as a medium for service discovery in WANs. To confirm that P 2 P overlays can in fact support service discovery, a technique to utilise the Distributed Hash Table (DHT) functionality of distributed systems is used to store and retrieve service advertisements. Through simulation, this is shown to be both a scalable and a flexible service discovery technique. However, the problems associated with P 2 P networks with respect to efficiency are well documented. In a novel approach to reduce messaging costs in P 2 P networks, multi-destination multicast is used. Two well known P 2 P overlays are extended using the Explicit <b>Multi-Unicast</b> (XCAST) protocol. The resulting analysis of this extension provides a strong argument for multiple P 2 P maintenance algorithms co-existing in a single P 2 P overlay to provide adaptable performance. A novel multi-tier P 2 P overlay system is presented, which is tailored for service rich mobile devices and which provides an efficient platform for service discovery...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we propose}} {{a suite of}} schemes for {{wireless}} multiuser relay networks, where multiple source nodes (SNs) and relay nodes (RNs) share the spectral resources and hence we take into the account the co-channel interference (CCI). Our objective is to deal with both the channel fading and CCI {{in order to improve}} the attainable outage performance. Firstly, we consider the opportunistic relay selection (ORS) design in the scenario, where multiple RNs are available for assisting the transmission of a single SN, while CCI is imposed by other SNs in the network. We design the single-user-detection-aided (SUD-aided) and multi-user-detection based successive interference-cancellation-aided (MUD-SIC-aided) systems, where multiple-user detection (MUD) receivers using successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the destination node (DN) are adopted to combat co-channel interference. In SUD-aided system, we employ single-user detection (SUD) at the RNs and MUD SIC at the DN. In MUD-SIC-aided system, we employ MUD-SIC at both the RNs and DN. We present the outage analysis of both systems based on an outage-optimised ORS scheme, implying that the proposed ORS scheme provides the best outage performance. We show that the traditional ORS scheme proposed for SUD receivers based on the highest SNR criterion is not outage-optimal, when employing MUD-SIC in the presence of CCI. Hence, we propose a novel ORS scheme based on a best-effort detection (BED) criterion that outperforms the traditional ORS scheme. Furthermore, considering the effects of the outdated channel state information (CSI), an improved BED-ORS is proposed for enhancing the robustness towards CSI imperfections. Then, we study the scenario, where multiple SNs are coordinated to share a RN. In this case, network coding (NC) may be invoked at the RN, which treats the CCI from other SNs as useful messages and superimposes them to reduce the time slots required for relaying, therefore achieving higher spectral efficiency. However, NC systems may not always be beneficial in cooperative communications, where the detrimental interference of the undesired SNs, often referred to as network coding noise (NC noise), may outweigh the benefits of NC. In previous works, the outage performance was only evaluated numerically for several case studies. Against this background, we propose a systematically analytical framework for evaluating the outage performance for a <b>multi-unicast</b> NC-aided network, where each DN extracts the information of the desired SN from the NC signal forwarded by the RN. As our main contribution, we present the outage analysis of this system in the presence of NC noise and the closed-form analytical outage probability expressions are derived for an arbitrary number of SN-DN pairs. We show that if NC is employed, the quality of the worst SN-DN link may dominate the outage performance of every SNs. We then consider a two-hop network, where multiple SNs transmit to a DN {{with the aid of a}} RN and we assume the direct link between the SNs and the DN is weak. In this scenario, we show that the NC-aided relaying is not preferred and hence the buffer-aided relaying (BAR) is advocated for improving the uplink. The RN is equipped with a buffer, which is capable of storing multiple frames received from the SNs. During each time slot, the proposed protocol activates either the SNRN hop or the RN-DN hop, depending on the channel quality of each hop and the buffer state at the RN. In order to optimise the hop selection for the network, we design a hop quality metric (HQM) and propose a multi-user buffer-aided-relaying uplink (MU-BR-UL) protocol. The benefits of the proposed protocol is analysed in terms of the end-to-end outage probability and the end-to-end transmission delay. Then, the optimal power allocation is proposed for minimizing the end-to-end outage probability under the total power constraint. Furthermore, the impact of the buffer size, the number of users and the relay position on the achievable outage performance are characterized. The results indicate that the outage performance is significantly improved when theproposed power allocation is utilized in the MU-BR-UL protocol. Finally, we consider a new family of networks, in which the SNs and RNs have energy harvesting (EH) capability, which allows the nodes to harvest energy from the environments and convert it to electrical energy for wireless transmissions. The EH removes the constraints of relying on a battery for constant power supply, but also demands novel energy usage policy (EUP) design for effectively utilizing the random power supply gleaned from the EH system. We start with the point-to-point (P 2 P) network and by effectively exploiting the statistics of the energy arrival rates, we propose novel search algorithms for designing the EUP, which achieve a significantly better outage performance than the state-of-the-art designs reported in the literature. Based on the proposed methods in P 2 P network, we design novel EUPs for spacedivision- multiple-access (SDMA) and SDMA-based relay sharing networks. We show that the proposed EUPs significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of outage performance. <br/...|$|E
