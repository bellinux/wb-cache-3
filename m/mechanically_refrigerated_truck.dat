40|$|An {{improper}} {{air distribution}} within <b>refrigerated</b> <b>truck</b> chambers {{is the major}} cause of inadequate road transport of perishable products under controlled temperature.

This paper presents a computational model to predict, and visualize, the temperature conditions (e. g. velocity, temperature and relative humidity) in <b>refrigerated</b> <b>truck</b> chambers. The model consists of a computer procedure, in which the general equations describing the airflow pattern and the heat/mass transfer in a refrigerated room are solved using the finite volume method. The effect of turbulence is described by the k-ε turbulence model. The computer model was experimental validated by measurements taken from a reduced-scale model designed to provide similarity with a prototype. The model was applied to calculate the indoor cold conditions provided by different types of air supply systems used in compartments of long road vehicles...|$|R

40|$|A <b>refrigerated</b> <b>truck</b> chamber {{is always}} under {{variable}} conditions. Not only weather changes but also {{loading and unloading}} processes can make the chamber behaviour dependent on time. A prediction of relevant properties distributions (velocity, temperature and relative humidity) in refrigerated chambers requires the simultaneous solution, by an iteration process, of the three-dimensional non-linear differential equations for the momentum and heat/mass transport. Basically, these two transport phenomena are coupled by the buoyancy force due to natural convection. However, especially for non-steady state thermal conditions, the high computations times become unattractive the simultaneous integration. For the majority of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>truck</b> chambers, in which the air flow is mainly dominated by forced convection, the equations can be decoupled and the two transport phenomena can be treated separately. Therefore, {{in the case of}} dynamic (transient) simulation, this strategy makes the problem much simpler and can strongly reduce the computation time. In this study the simulation method described here was applied in a case study modelling (steady and transient) and was validated by measurements taken from an experimental reduced-scale model.

The model consists of a computer procedure, in which the general equations describing the airflow pattern and the heat/mass transfer in a refrigerated room are solved using the finite volume method. The computer model was experimentally validated by measurements taken from a reduced-scale model designed to provide similarity with a prototype. The computational model was applied to calculate the cold quality, for example the temperature distribution, provided by different types of air supply systems used in compartments of long-haul vehicles. The results of the numerical solutions demonstrate how the model can be profitably used in practice to study and develop the design of refrigerated chambers...|$|R
