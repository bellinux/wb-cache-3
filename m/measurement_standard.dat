2500|$|According to tradition, the qin {{originally}} had five strings, representing the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire and earth. Later, in the Zhou dynasty, Zhou Wen Wang added a sixth string to mourn his son, Bo Yihou. His successor, Zhou Wu Wang, added a seventh string to motivate his troops into {{battle with the}} Shang. The thirteen hui on the surface represent the 13 {{months of the year}} (the extra 13th is the 'leap month' in the lunar calendar). The surface board is round to represent Heaven and the bottom board flat to represent earth. The entire length of the qin (in Chinese measurements) is 3 chi, 6 cun and 5 fen; representing the 365 days of the year (though this is just a standard since qins can be shorter or longer depending on the period's <b>measurement</b> <b>standard</b> or the maker's preference). Each part of the qin has meaning, some more obvious, like [...] "dragon pool" [...] and [...] "phoenix pond".|$|E
40|$|<b>Measurement</b> <b>standards</b> {{are like}} {{institutional}} facts – they enable the travel of information across different domains: geographical, social, institutional or contextual. Uncovering the reasons underlying {{how and why}} <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> are adopted can provide insights into how ‘well’ such facts travel. Using the example of measurements in the London coal trade c 1830, I explore how <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> travel across different domains and why groups switch from one standard to another. In this specific example, I investigate how standardized measurements replaced the customary practice of heaped measures and, and argue that <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> replaced the system of public measurements as a mechanism to ensure transparency in transactions. I further argue that <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> were embedded in an institutional ‘package’ of artefacts, regulations and customary practices making this a process of negotiated change. Institutional facts are bounded by other institutional structures. In this case of <b>measurement</b> <b>standards,</b> facts appear to have travelled well when a change was made to the entire institutional context {{and not just the}} measurement artefact...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} ensure a {{reliable}} calibration of surface topography measuring instruments the use of practical calibration strategies is required. This requirement can be fulfilled when <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> with a defined surface structure in accordance to the later obsessed application are used. Different examples for the design and manufacturing of accordant <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> have been investigated by the authors. Within this publication a generic reverse engineering approach {{for the design of}} geometrical <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> is deducted from these results. The physical effects that occur because of the manufacturing with an ultraprecision turning machine and the sampling of the <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> are mathematically inversed and considered. The practical abilities of the approach are illustrated exemplarily. These theoretical considerations for the design can be verified experimentally by the manufacturing of the samples with an ultra-precision turning process. In doing so, the high precision of the new design approach can be validated. The examinations confirm the universality of the reverse engineering approach for the design of <b>measurement</b> <b>standards...</b>|$|R

2500|$|A-frequency-weighting is {{mandated}} by the international standard IEC 61672 to be fitted to all sound level meters. The old B- and D-frequency-weightings have fallen into disuse, but many sound level meters provide for C frequency-weighting and its fitting is mandated [...] at least for testing purposes [...] to precision (Class one) sound level meters. D-frequency-weighting was specifically designed for use when measuring high level aircraft noise {{in accordance with the}} IEC 537 <b>measurement</b> <b>standard.</b> The large peak in the D-weighting curve is not a feature of the equal-loudness contours, but reflects the fact that humans hear random noise differently from pure tones, an effect that is particularly pronounced around 6kHz. This is because individual neurons from different regions of the cochlea in the inner ear respond to narrow bands of frequencies, but the higher frequency neurons integrate a wider band and hence signal a louder sound when presented with noise containing many frequencies than for a single pure tone of the same pressure level. Following changes to the ISO standard, D-frequency-weighting should now only be used for non-bypass engines and as these are not fitted to commercial aircraft [...] but only to military ones [...] A-frequency-weighting is now mandated for light civilian aircraft measurements, while a more accurate loudness-corrected weighting EPNdB is required for certification of large transport aircraft ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Division of Acoustics and Vibration (DIAVI) of INMETRO establishes, validates and {{maintains}} the Brazilian national <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> {{used for the}} realization of the units of physical quantities related to the field of acoustics and vibration. The basic vibration quantity realized by DIAVI is translational acceleration, from which the other motion quantities, i. e., velocity and displacement can be derived. Acoustical physical quantities include sound pressure and sound power. The national <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> comprise both absolute (primary) and comparison (secondary) calibration set-ups, which are used to cover the wide range of calibration and testing services demanded by the Brazilian society, trade, industry and science.
