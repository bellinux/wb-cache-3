The northern sculptor and the southern slaveholder had already clashed over a liberty cap in the interior decoration of the Capitol.Davis sent his aide, Captain Montgomery Meigs, with orders to remove the cap, saying that [...] "its history renders it inappropriate to a people who were born free and would not be enslaved".
