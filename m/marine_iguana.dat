[...] These represent the major taxons of mammals (e.g., beaver, otter, polar bear), birds (e.g., penguins, ducks), reptiles (e.g., anaconda, bog turtle, <b>marine</b> <b>iguana)</b> and amphibians ( [...] e.g., salamanders, frogs, newts).|$|E

50|$|Lava lizards may scurry over <b>marine</b> <b>iguanas</b> when hunting flies, and Darwin's finches and mockingbirds {{sometimes}} feed on mites and ticks {{that they}} pick off their skin. <b>Marine</b> <b>iguanas</b> typically ignore these visits.|$|R
50|$|Introduced predators, {{to which}} they have little or no protection, include animals such as pigs, dogs, cats and rats. Dogs may take adult <b>marine</b> <b>iguanas,</b> while the others may feed on their young or eggs. This {{inhibits}} reproduction and the long-term survival of the species. Among the few natural predators are Galápagos hawks, short-eared owls, lava gulls, herons and Galápagos racer snakes that may take small <b>marine</b> <b>iguanas.</b> Of the native predators, the hawk is likely the most important, but <b>marine</b> <b>iguanas</b> have anti-predator strategies that reduce its impact.|$|R

5000|$|Island Population: The <b>Marine</b> <b>Iguana</b> is en {{endemic species}} of the Galapagos Islands, but it evolved from a {{mainland}} ancestor of land iguana.

50|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>iguanas</b> {{are sexually}} dimorphic with adult males {{weighing}} about 70% more than adult females.

Large body size in males is selected sexually, but can be detrimental during El Niño events when resources are scarce. This results in large males suffering higher mortality than females and smaller adult males. The mortality rates of <b>marine</b> <b>iguanas</b> are explained through the size difference between the sexes.|$|R

50|$|The first hybrid iguana was {{discovered}} in 1981. In 1997, high ocean temperatures during a severe El Niño season caused failure of the seaweed beds around the Galapagos Islands and about half the <b>marine</b> <b>iguanas</b> starved to death. Others searched inland for plants to eat. They also mated with the land iguanas, which produced an unusual number of hybrid iguanas. As of 2003, twenty had been found. DNA testing by a German researcher revealed that <b>marine</b> <b>iguanas</b> were the fathers and land iguanas the mothers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>iguanas</b> have sharp {{claws and}} are able to grip rock under {{seawater}} and eat seaweed, whereas land iguanas lack sharp claws making them unable to climb on the cacti which are their staple foods. Due to decreased quantities of seaweed, <b>marine</b> <b>iguanas</b> will often seek food on the land, taking over the food source from the colonies of land iguanas.Hybrid iguanas have sharp claws and can climb on cacti and also eat seaweed underwater. It is held that the hybrid iguana can survive in both sea and land environments. Despite their long separation time and there being two distinct species from different genera, the offspring are viable, although likely sterile. The hybrid iguanas have a laterally compressed tail like that of the <b>marine</b> <b>iguanas,</b> but they have not been seen swimming. They also have sharp claws like their marine fathers, which enable them to climb for food rather than waiting for it to drop from a cactus as the land iguanas do.|$|R
50|$|The <b>marine</b> <b>iguana</b> (Amblyrhynchus cristatus), {{also known}} as the Galápagos <b>marine</b> <b>iguana,</b> is a species of iguana found only on the Galápagos Islands (Ecuador) that has the ability, unique among modern lizards, to forage in the sea, making it a marine reptile. This iguana feeds almost {{exclusively}} on algae and large males dive to find this food source, while females and smaller males feed during low tide in the intertidal zone. They mainly live in colonies on rocky shores where they warm after visiting the relatively cold water or intertidal zone, but can also be seen in marshes, mangrove and beaches.|$|E

50|$|The hybrid iguana {{is a first}} {{generation}} hybrid, the result of intergeneric breeding between a male <b>marine</b> <b>iguana</b> (genus Amblyrhynchus) and a female land iguana (genus Conolophus) on South Plaza Island in the Galapagos Islands where the territories of the two species overlap.|$|E
