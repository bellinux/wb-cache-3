5000|$|The {{manufacture}} of candles became an industrialised mass {{market in the}} mid 19th century. In 1834, Joseph Morgan, a pewterer from Manchester, England, patented a machine that revolutionised candle making. It allowed for continuous production of molded candles by using a cylinder with a <b>moveable</b> <b>piston</b> to eject candles as they solidified. This more efficient mechanized production produced about 1,500 candles per hour, (according to his patent [...] "[...] with three men and five boys machine will manufacture two tons of candle in twelve hours"). This allowed candles to become an easily affordable commodity for the masses.|$|E

Candlemakers also began to fashion wicks out of tightly braided (rather than simply twisted) strands of cotton. This technique makes wicks curl over as they burn, maintaining {{the height of the}} wick and therefore the flame. Because much of the excess wick is incinerated, these are referred to as [...] "self-trimming" [...] or [...] "self-consuming" [...] wicks.|$|E
40|$|As a {{hydraulic}} actuator is used over time, the piston seal that closes {{the gap between}} the <b>moveable</b> <b>piston</b> and the cylinder wall wears. This results in the fluid to eventually being able to flow across the piston and between the cylinder chambers. Although no fluid is lost from the circuit, the dynamic performance of the system is affected since only a portion of the flow delivered to the actuator is available to move the piston against the load. Leakage across the piston introduces a flow deadband, which can lead to servoing errors. This paper presents an approach based on the cross-correlation time-series analysis to determine the health of hydraulic actuator internal seals. Pressure signals obtained directly from routine operations are analyzed using the cross-correlation function. The method presented in this paper is shown to be capable of detecting leakages as small as 0. 069 l/min...|$|E
50|$|Melt {{filtration}} {{is typically}} used to remove contaminants from polymer melts during the extrusion process. There is a mechanical {{separation of the}} contaminants within a machine called a ‘screen changer’. A typical system will consist of a steel housing with the filtration medium contained in <b>moveable</b> <b>pistons</b> or slide plates that enable the processor to remove the screens from the extruder flow without stopping production. The contaminants are usually collected on woven wire screens which are supported on a stainless steel plate called a ‘breaker plate’ -- a strong circular piece of steel drilled with large holes to allow {{the flow of the}} polymer melt. For the recycling of polyester it is typical to integrate a screen changer into the extrusion line. This can be in a pelletizing, sheet extrusion or strapping tape extrusion line.|$|R
50|$|A wall can {{be fixed}} (e.g. a {{constant}} volume reactor) or <b>moveable</b> (e.g. a <b>piston).</b> For example, in a reciprocating engine, a fixed wall means the piston is locked at its position; then, a constant volume process may occur. In that same engine, a piston may be unlocked and allowed to move in and out. Ideally, a wall may be declared adiabatic, diathermal, impermeable, permeable, or semi-permeable. Actual physical materials that provide walls with such idealized properties are not always readily available.|$|R
40|$|A {{moveable}} valve {{for controlling}} flow of a pressurized working fluid was designed. This valve {{consists of a}} hollow, <b>moveable</b> floating <b>piston</b> pressed against a stationary solid seat, and can use the working fluid to seal the valve. This open/closed, novel valve is able to use metal-to-metal seats, without requiring seat sliding action; therefore there are no associated damaging effects. During use, existing standard high-pressure ball valve seats tend to become damaged during rotation of the ball. Additionally, forces acting on the ball and stem create large amounts of friction. The combination of these effects can lead to system failure. In an attempt to reduce damaging effects and seat failures, soft seats in the ball valve have been eliminated; however, the sliding action of the ball across the highly loaded seat still tends to scratch the seat, causing failure. Also, in order to operate, ball valves {{require the use of}} large actuators. Positioning the metal-to-metal seats requires more loading, which tends to increase the size of the required actuator, and can also lead to other failures in other areas such as the stem and bearing mechanisms, thus increasing cost and maintenance. This novel non-sliding seat surface valve allows metal-to-metal seats without the damaging effects that can lead to failure, and enables large seating forces without damaging the valve. Additionally, this valve design, even when used with large, high-pressure applications, does not require large conventional valve actuators and the valve stem itself is eliminated. Actuation is achieved {{with the use of a}} small, simple solenoid valve. This design also eliminates the need for many seals used with existing ball valve and globe valve designs, which commonly cause failure, too. This, coupled with the elimination of the valve stem and conventional valve actuator, improves valve reliability and seat life. Other mechanical liftoff seats have been designed; however, they have only resulted in increased cost, and incurred other reliability issues. With this novel design, the seat is lifted by simply removing the working fluid pressure that presses it against the seat and no external force is required. By eliminating variables associated with existing ball and globe configurations that can have damaging effects upon a valve, this novel design reduces downtime in rocket engine test schedules and maintenance costs...|$|R
40|$|The {{second case}} for this {{workshop}} builds upon the isolated synthetic jet of Case 1 {{by adding a}} crossflow, with no streamwise pressure gradient, for the developing jet to interact with. Formally, Case 2 examines the interaction of a single, isolated, synthetic jet and a fully turbulent zero-pressure gradient boundary layer. The resulting flow has many of the characteristics {{that need to be}} modeled with fidelity if the results of the calculations are to {{serve as the basis for}} research and design with active flow control devices. These include the turbulence in the boundary layer, the time-evolution of the large vortical structure emanating from the jet orifice and its subsequent interaction with and distortion by the boundary layer turbulence, and the effect of the suction cycle on the boundary layer flow. In a synthetic jet, the flow through the orifice and out into the outer flowfield alternates between an exhaust and a suction cycle, driven by the contraction and expansion of a cavity internal to the actuator. In the present experiment, the volume changes in the internal cavity are accomplished by replacing one of the rigid walls of the cavity, the wall opposite the orifice exit, with a deformable wall. This flexible wall is driven by a bottom-mounted <b>moveable</b> <b>piston.</b> The piston is driven electro-mechanically. The synthetic jet issues into the external flow through a circular orifice. In the present experiment, this orifice has a diameter of 0. 250 inches (6. 35 mm). The flow is conceptually similar to that documented in Schaeffler [1]. To document the flow, several measurement techniques were utilized. The upstream boundary conditions (in-flow conditions), and several key phase-averaged velocity profiles were measured with a 3 -component laser-Doppler velocimetry system. Phase-averaged velocity field measurements were made with both stereo digital particle image velocimetry and 2 -D digital particle image velocimetry as the primary measurement system. Surface pressure measurements were made utilizing an electronically scanned pressure system...|$|E
