Due to the environmental issue, it is a need to reduce the application of cement and/or to replace partially the cement with other environmental-friendly compounds. One of these compounds is rice husk ash (RSA), which is agricultural wastes. The objective {{of this paper is to}} study the influence of RSA and clay as partial replacement to cement in soil stabilization of silt soil with high plasticity (MH) using cement. The cement used was ordinary Portland cement, while the RHA was obtained by burning rice husk at temperature of 250 °C. The <b>MH</b> <b>soil</b> is stabilized with 4 % cement, 4 % cement and 3 % rice husk ash and 4 % cement, 3 % RHA and 3 % clay. The various tests were conducted on the pure and stabilized soils. Results have indicated that application of 4 % cement, 3 % RHA and 3 % clay as silt soil stabilization is more favorable in increasing soil strength and reducing brittle behaviour of soil...|$|E
40|$|An {{innovative}} {{technique of}} electro osmosis coupled with vertical surcharge loading {{to accelerate the}} consolidation and stiffen Kaolin (China Clay Grade E) was investigated in this study. The geotechnical properties of this China Clay Kaolin Grade E and the design of electro osmotic consolidation chamber are discussed together with {{an explanation of the}} procedural concept of the electro osmotic consolidation chamber (i. e., the preparation of the apparatus and the clay sample, assembling of the electro osmotic consolidation chamber; and the experimental work). The plastic limit, liquid limit and plasticity index were 35 %, 53 % and 18 % respectively. Therefore, China Clay Kaolin Grade E is classified as <b>MH</b> <b>soil,</b> and it is predominantly a silt with high plasticity. The specific gravity of the soil is 2. 65. To ensure the kaolin is saturated, all samples were prepared in a similar manner with deaired water to produce a slurry at 150 % of the liquid limit (initial moisture content of 79. 5 %). The electro osmotic consolidation chamber was cylindrical and consisted of the body, the base and the top cap. The body and the base of the chamber were constructed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tube with a wall thickness of 10. 9 mm, 345 mm high and 251 mm inner diameter. The electro osmotic consolidation chamber was assembled together with a 45 mm thick flange and collar. The top cap of this chamber was based on that of a Rowe cell of similar diameter. Twenty one tests were performed in this study with an applied voltage and one test was a control test. The test samples in the twenty one tests were all consolidated to three different phases. In Phases 1 and 2, the samples were consolidated at 15 kPa while in the Phase 3, 50 kPa was used. The electro osmotic process was only performed during Phase 2. The time of treatment, numbers of electrodes, the arrangement of electrodes, and the applied voltages were investigated in these tests. Results from these tests indicated that the China Clay Kaolin Grade E in a 79. 5 % slurry form responded well to electro osmotic treatment and that electro osmotic process increased the overall stiffness of the soil as indicated by the reduced relative settlement in Phase 3 with a pressure of 50 kPa. The water content around the anodes was less than that at the cathode creating zones of higher average constrained stiffness. The tests demonstrated that the longer the time of treatment, the greater the numbers of anodes, the shorter distance between the electrodes and the higher the applied voltages associated with electro osmosis increased the average stiffness of the soil mass confirming the concept of an electro osmotic pile.

40|$|Landslide hazard {{assessment}} of densely forested, remote, {{and difficult to}} access areas can be rapidly accomplished with airborne {{light detection and ranging}} (lidar) data. An evaluation of geomorphic change by lidar-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) coupled with geotechnical soils analysis, aerial photographs, ground measurements, precipitation data, and numerical modeling can provide valuable insight to the reactivation process of unstable landslides. A landslide was selected based on previous work by Mickleson (2011) and Burns et al. (2010) that identified the Madrone Landslide with significant volumetric changes. This study expands on previous work though an evaluation of the timing and causation of slope failure of the Madrone Landslide. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate landslide morphology, precipitation data, historical aerial photographs, ground crack measurements, geotechnical properties of soil, numerical modeling, and elevation data (with multi-temporal lidar data), to determine the conditions associated with failure of the Madrone Landslide. To evaluate the processes involved and timing of slope failure events, a deep seated potentially unstable landslide, situated near the contact of Eocene sedimentary and volcanic rocks, was selected for a detailed analysis. The Madrone Landslide (45. 298383 /- 123. 338796) is located in Yamhill County, about 12 kilometers west of Carlton, Oregon. Site elevation ranges from 206 meters (m) North American Vertical Datum (NAVD- 88) near the head scarp to 152 m at the toe. The landslide is composed of two parts, an upper more recent rotational slump landslide and a lower much older earth flow landslide. The upper slide has an area of 2, 700 m 2 with a head scarp of 5 - 7 m and a volume of 15, 700 m 3. The lower earth flow has an area of 2300 m 2, a head scarp of 15 m, and a volume of 287, 500 m 3. Analysis of aerial photographs indicates the lower slide probably originated between 1956 and 1963. The landslide is located at a geologic unit contact of Eocene deep marine sedimentary rock and intrusive volcanic rock. The landslide was instrumented with 20 crack monitors established across ground cracks and measured periodically. Field measurements did not detect ground crack displacement over a 15 month period. Soil samples indicate the soil is an <b>MH</b> <b>soil</b> with a unit weight of 12 kN/m 3 and residual friction angle of 28 φ 2 ̆ 7 r which were both used as input for slope stability modeling. Differential DEMs from lidar data were calculated to generate a DEM of Difference (DoD) raster to identify and quantify elevation changes. Historical aerial photograph review, differential lidar analysis, and precipitation data suggest the upper portion of the landslide failed as a result of the December 2007 storm...|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: Ipswich City {{is located}} in {{south-east}} Queensland and is underlain by predominantly impermeable subsoils which cause periodic subsurface water-logging and typically classified as expansive, CH and <b>MH</b> <b>soils.</b> Council has battled with effective pavement design and construction due to poor subgrade behaviour. Unbound pavements are historically the dominant design used in Ipswich and are typically based on the AUSTROADS and Department of Transport and Main Roads manuals and experience. The subgrade of any foundation {{plays an important role}} in load bearing and support of traffic and pavement construction over expansive clays requires a suitable working platform to enable machinery to operate. Studies show the use of safe bearing capacity for subgrade assessment does not suit CH soils. Subgrade treatment needs to be a mandatory consideration coupled with using the lowest CBR readings to provide the maximum pavement thickness. The most effective method of subgrade treatment currently appears to be geosynthetics placed on the subgrade. The latest Austroads and Department of Transport and Main Roads manuals align with current world best practice for pavement design and it is recommended the latest versions continue to be used for new pavements. The Ipswich Planning Scheme Policy should refer directly to these documents and be specific for Ipswich soils, i. e. the greater depth pavement should be chosen based on a low CBR value and realistic design ESA's number. On expansive soils, a flexible surface should be constructed on an impermeable membrane or layer since flexible bases experience fatigue which can be easily maintained whereas rigid bases can crack rapidly and to the detriment of the entire foundation. Identification of the cause of pavement failure is necessary to determine the appropriate rehabilitation method for a failed pavement. Council should consider sustainable rehabilitation methods that maintain a flexible pavement with asphalt surfacing...|$|R

40|$|The binding {{mechanism}} of the herbicide maleic hydrazide (<b>MH)</b> to mineral <b>soil</b> clay surfaces has been studied by adsorption isotherms at different pH, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results showed different mechanisms depending of the surface characteristics of the minerals. For hydroxylated (variable charge) surfaces such as lepidocrocite and sepiolite, the adsorption of MH occurred at external surfaces whereas for phyllosilicates of negative permanent charge, such as montmorillonite, MH penetred also in the interlamellar spaces, as shown by XRD results. FT-IR spectra of MH-mineral complexes showed that MH was bonded to surface hydroxyl on lepidocrocite and sepiolite and to exchangeable cation, directly or through water-bridge, on montmorillonite by C= 0 groups of the herbicide molecule.

40|$|Due to its low permeability, a clay liner is {{the main}} {{material}} used in solid waste disposal landfills. It is exposed there to various chemical, biological, and physical events, and the clay liner {{is affected by the}} resulting leachate. For this reason, when attempting to define the geotechnical characteristics of clay liners, the use of distilled water or tap water is far from being representative of the in-situ conditions. In this study, the effects of 4 different salt solutions on the consistency limits of clays were experimentally investigated. The salt solutions used as leachate compounds were ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl), potassium chloride (KCl), copper(II) sulfate (CuSO 4), and iron(II) sulfate (FeSO 4). Consistency limit tests were conducted on low plasticity (CL-class) and high plasticity (CH-class) commercial clays using both distilled water and these salt solutions. The experimental results indicated that the liquid limit increased when the salt concentration for the CL clay was increased. Moreover, the liquid limit was found to decrease when the salt concentration for the CH clay was increased. The plastic limit of the CL clay increased as the salt concentration increased to a certain value. However, the plastic limit of CH clay decreased at low salt concentrations and increased at high salt concentrations. In addition, the test results indicated that salt solutions at high concentrations changed the soil class of clays. In other words, for the conditions investigated, CL and CH class clays were transformed into low plasticity silt (ML) and high plasticity silt (<b>MH)</b> class <b>soils,</b> respectively, according to the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) ...|$|R

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2005 This {{study is}} part of the FROSTFIRE experiment, a {{controlled}} bum of black spruce (BS) and mixed hardwood (MH) forest in the boreal zone of Interior Alaska in 1999. As part of the examination of post-burn changes in soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics, this study reports on active soil C and net N mineralization and nitrification in-situ over one year (beginning the year after the burn) in BS and <b>MH</b> stands. Total <b>soil</b> C and N concentrations and pools were higher in burned BS (BS-B) than in controls (BS-C), whereas MH stands (MH-B and MH-C) showed no fire effect. MH stands exhibited substantially higher net N mineralization and nitrification rates than equivalent BS stands. Annual net N mineralization was lower and annual net nitrification was much higher in MH-B stands than in controls, whereas it did not differ between BS-B Band BS-C. Potentially mineralizable soil C was substantially higher in BS than in MH and was lower in burned soils relative to controls. Findings indicate that post-fire soil N dynamics in Interior Alaska are highly dependent on forest type and that MH stands, but not BS, may be a large source of soil nitrate (NO₃⁻) after fire...|$|R
40|$|Residual soils with {{extensive}} weathering of parent materials can yield collapsible soil deposits. In Malaysia, residual granite and sedimentary rock soils occur extensively, i. e. cover more than 80 % of the country’s land area. These types of soil {{have a high}} possibility to collapse when wetted. This paper described a study that had been carried out to {{examine the effect of}} wetting on the collapsibility and shear strength of the tropical residual soils. Odometer tests (single and double) and double shear box tests were carried out on selected soil samples. In addition Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) test and X-Ray Diffraction Analysis were also carried out. From the result obtained, both types of soils were found to collapse upon wetting (inundation). The finer granitic residual <b>soil</b> (<b>MH)</b> apparently showed a slightly higher collapse potential compared with the relatively coarser sedimentary residual soil (SM). The SEM analysis indicated that the soil structure became more compacted and voids between the structures became smaller upon collapse. The shear strength tests showed that the shear strength of both soil reduced significantly upon collapse, in particular the soil apparent cohesion, with the granitic residual soil showing more strength reduction compared with the sedimentary residual soil...|$|R
30|$|Kelley’s ratio (KR) {{indicates}} balance among Na+, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ions in water. KR of {{more than}} 1 indicates an excess level of Na+ in water. Kelley (1963) suggested that the ratio for irrigation water should not exceed 1. Only G 4 water exceeds such standard (Table  5). Magnesium adsorption ratio (MAR) causes harmful effect to soil when it exceeds 50 (Gupta and Gupta 1987). Highest MAR observed {{in the study area}} is 30.39 for G 2 that ensures no such effect to soil. Moreover, at the same level of salinity and SAR, adsorption of Na+ by soil and clay minerals is more at higher Mg:Ca ratio. Because the bonding energy of Mg 2 + is less than that of Ca 2 + that allows more Na+ adsorption and it happens when the ratio exceeds 4 (Michael 1992). Richards LA (US Salinity Laboratory) (1954) named this ratio as magnesium hazard (<b>MH).</b> Additionally, <b>soil</b> containing high levels of exchangeable Mg 2 + causes infiltration problem (Ayers and Westcot 1985). The study area have low Mg:Ca ratios than 4 (Table  5) that shows no threat of infiltration problem for soil from the groundwater. Similar to Mg:Ca ratio, Na:Ca ratio also indicates possible threat to infiltration problem arising from used irrigation water. Presence of excessive Na+ in irrigation water promotes soil dispersion and structural break down when Na:Ca ratio exceeds 3. Infiltration problem will occur from such high ratio primarily due to lack of sufficient Ca 2 + to counter the dispersing effect of Na+. Excessive Na+ also create problems in crop water uptake, poor seedling emergence, lack of aeration, plant and root diseases, etc. (Ayers and Westcot 1985). Present study area has Na:Ca ratio less than 3 (Table  5) which demonstrates that there is no possibility of infiltration problem occurring in the groundwater. Considering pH, EC, SAR and TH the groundwater of the study area is suitable for irrigation as found in Pabna district (Sarkar and Hassan 2006) and Bogra district (Islam and Shamsad 2009) which are situated at the southeast and northeast of the study area, respectively. Although in these studies KR and SSP are found to be suitable for irrigation, current research does not reveal suitability for all water types.|$|R

Phytoextraction, {{which is one of}} the plant-based technologies, has attracted the most attention for the bioremediation of soils polluted with these contaminants. The aim of this study was to determine whether the multiple-tolerant bacterium, Brevibacterium casei MH 8 a isolated from the heavy metal-contaminated rhizosphere soil of Sinapis alba L., is able to promote plant growth and enhance Cd, Zn and Cu uptake by white mustard under laboratory conditions. Additionally, the ability of the rifampicin-resistant spontaneous mutant of MH 8 a to colonize plant tissues and its mechanisms of plant growth promotion were also examined. In order to assess the ecological consequences of bioaugmentation on autochthonous bacteria, the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was used. The MH 8 a strain exhibited the ability to produce ammonia, 1 -amino-cyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid deaminase, indole 3 -acetic acid and HCN but was not able to solubilize inorganic phosphate and produce siderophores. Introduction of MH 8 a into soil significantly increased S. alba biomass and the accumulation of Cd (208 %), Zn (86 %) and Cu (39 %) in plant shoots in comparison with those grown in non-inoculated soil. Introduced into the <b>soil,</b> <b>MH</b> 8 a was able to enter the plant and was found in the roots and leaves of inoculated plants thus indicating its endophytic features. PLFA analysis revealed that the MH 8 a that was introduced into soil had a temporary influence on the structure of the autochthonous bacterial communities. The plant growth-promoting features of the MH 8 a strain and its ability to enhance the metal uptake by white mustard and its long-term survival in soil as well as its temporary impact on autochthonous microorganisms make the strain a suitable candidate for the promotion of plant growth and the efficiency of phytoextraction...|$|R
40|$|Os solos tropicais altamente intemperizados tendem a acumular residualmente óxidos de ferro e alumínio. Entre os óxidos e hidróxidos de ferro presentes na fração argila, a goethita (Gt) e a hematita (Hm) são os mais abundantes e estudados. No entanto, há poucos estudos acerca da identificação e quantificação da maghemita (Mh), um mineral ferrimagnético que está na fração argila dos solos, principalmente naqueles desenvolvidos de rochas máficas. A Mh e a magnetita (Mt) são responsáveis pela magnetização espontânea dos solos. Esse atributo mineralógico pode ser medido nos solos e sedimentos pela susceptibilidade magnética por unidade de massa (&# 967;BF), cuja {{magnitude}} é proporcional à concentração dos minerais ferrimagnéticos e é objeto de estudos em todo mundo. O objetivo deste trabalho foi identificar e quantificar, por &# 967;BF, os minerais ferrimagnéticos de 32 amostras do horizonte B de solos do Estado do Paraná. As formas minerais presentes na fração argila concentrada de óxidos de ferro foram identificadas e semiquantificadas por difratometria de raios-X (DRX). Nessa fração, os minerais mais abundantes são a Gt e a Hm. A Mh foi detectada em 31 amostras por &# 967;BF e em apenas 17 por DRX. Os valores de &# 967;BF variaram de 16 a 8. 077 na TFSA, de 12 a 7. 953 na fração argila e de 0 a 18. 737 x 10 - 8 m³ kg- 1 na fração argila, após concentração dos óxidos de ferro. A Mh dos solos estudados apresentou valor médio de &# 967;BF em 62. 728 x 10 - 8 m³ kg- 1 e sua presença nos difratogramas de raios-X só foi verificada em amostras com valores de &# 967;BF acima de 1. 000 x 10 - 8 m³ kg- 1. Highly weathered tropical soils tend {{to accumulate}} iron and aluminum oxy-hydroxides. Among the iron oxy-hydroxides {{found in the}} clay fraction, goethite (Gt) and hematite (Hm) are the most abundant and studied. A smaller number of investigations have been publish to identify and to quantify maghemite (Mh), a ferrimagnetic mineral present in the clay size fraction of the soils, mainly in those developed from mafic rocks. Maghemite, along with magnetite (Mt) {{is responsible for the}} spontaneous magnetic behavior of the soils. This mineralogical attribute can be easy measured, in soils and sediments by mass magnetic susceptibility (&# 967;LF), which magnitude is proportional to the concentration of ferrimagnetic minerals and it has been object of studies worldwide. The purpose of this research was to identify and quantify, by &# 967;LF, the ferrimagnetic minerals of 32 samples from B-horizons of Paraná state soils. The mineral species present in the iron oxides concentrated clay size fractions were identified and semiquantified by x-rays diffraction (XRD). In this fraction the most abundant minerals are Gt and Hm. Maghemite was detected in 31 samples by &# 967;LF and in only 17 samples by XRD.
