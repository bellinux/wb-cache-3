40|$|In {{the last}} years, blooms of Planktothrix rubescens were {{observed}} in several lakes undergoing re-oligotrophication. Lake Ledro (zmax= 48 m) is a mesotrophic, hardwater lake (650 m a. s. l.) located in SW Trentino (Eastern Italian Alps). It is an impacted lake exploited for hydropower production. In the 70 s and the 80 s the lake suffered from eutrophication, {{but in the past}} two decades water quality improved most likely as consequence of the introduction of a waste water treatment plant. Despite this, the cyanobacteria contribution increased and a very intense bloom of Planktothrixrubescens was observed during the 2009 fall and subsequent winter and spring. In an attempt to solve this problem, the Autonomous Province of Trento funded a multidisciplinary research project to study the environmental and biotic factors promoting the development of Planktothrix populations. The annual nutrient load from the catchment area was calculated from water balance and surface and groundwater nutrient inputs, with the identification of the possible sources of nutrients. Environmental variables were acquired on discrete samples and in situ by multiparameter probes and instrumentations fixed on the principal inlet, in piezometers and on a platform, equipped with <b>meteorological</b> 59 <b>instrumentation,</b> moored to the lake bottom.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Snowpack {{evolution}} models {{developed in}} Europe require <b>meteorological</b> and radiation <b>instrumentation</b> rarely used in North America. In contrast, SAWLEM uses a spreadsheet {{to model the}} evolution of persistent weak layers and the overlying dry slabs using weekly manual snow profiles in a study plot and daily measurements or long-term average values of snowfall. The shear strength of a persistent weak layer, dependent on the grain type, is estimated based on parameters such as slab load, grain size, thickness of the weak layer, thickness of the slab, snowpack height and temperature just below the weak layer from a detailed manual profile in a study plot. The calculated shear strength is adjusted daily based on the most recently measured snow profile parameters and recent snowfall rates or average long-term snowfall values in the area according to previously published empirical models. Slab load, ski penetration and skier stress {{at the base of}} the slab and subsequently skier stability indices based on the ratio of shear strength to shear stress such as Sk 38 are calculated. For daily calculations of Sk 38 the slab settles according to the long-term average and the 24 hour snowfall is added to the slab thickness in order to calculate the slab load on days without snowprofile observations. We summarize comparisons of the estimated and measured shear strength as well as correlations of Sk 38 with skier-triggered avalanche activity in the Columbia Mountains...|$|R

40|$|A case is {{made for}} the {{detection}} of melting snow or ice using multispectral remote sensing from earth satellites. Snow and thick ice are highly reflective in both the visible and the near-infrared portions of the clectrornagnetic spectrum. During thaw conditions, however, near-infrared radiation is absorbed strongly, while reflection of visible radiation is only slightly affected. Simultaneous visible and near-infrared imagery from the Nimbus 3 satellite illustrates how these reflectance differences can be used to obtain information of hydrologic usefulness. Two examples of such use arc presented. Hydrologic information from earth satellites has been increased by the addition to the Nimbus 3 <b>meteorological</b> satellite of <b>instrumentation</b> to obtain solar reflectance imagery from the near-infrared.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the energy balance and hydrology of a glacier at the ice surface interface during the melt season. Experimental sub-catchments were established on the ablation area of the Peyto Glacier, Alberta, Canada, during the summers of 1994, 1995 and 1997. These sub-catchments were equipped with <b>meteorological</b> and hydrological <b>instrumentation</b> to examine relationships in the surface layer. Specifically, the development of a phenomenon known as the weathering crust is followed by examining the ratio between potential surface lowering (calculated from energy available for melt) and actual surface lowering (as measured in the field). This enables an indirect division of weathering crust development into growth and decay stages. Weathering crust growth is driven by K* while decay is driven by positive inputs of QH + QE + L*. Analysis was undertaken within periods of weathering crust growth, crustal decay and when little or no apparent melt was occurring. Actual differences between measured and potential surface lowering were also calculated. Further, associated stage records for the 1997 field season were examined for periods of weathering crust growth and decay in order to examine lags within the system. This analysis led to the simulation of ice densities at increasing depths within an ice column, based on weathering crust processes. The simulation was driven by data collected in the field. An addition to the simulation which allows for re-freezing of water within the crust indicates that the effect of re-freezing of ice during the melt season is virtually negligible. Further, subsurface priming is indicated under daytime conditions when there is a net energy loss at the surface. It is proposed that the results from the simulations produce a suitable surrogate for indicating the resultant changes in ice density given weathering crust development, thus providing an insight into events in the field. It is concluded that the weathering crust phenomenon is a complex relationship between energy inputs, initial crustal conditions and mechanical thresholds. Daytime weathering crust decay is the most complicated to analyse, as growth and decay are occurring simultaneously, even though decay is the dominant process. Daytime growth and nocturnal decay are the most straightforward cases. Weathering crust development appears to dampen catchment response by increasing storage in the lower density ice in the late morning. Further, the storage capacity of a highly developed weathering crust can result in drainage from the system overnight. This overnight drainage can be compounded by nocturnal crustal decay...|$|R

Analysis of alternative hypotheses demonstrates that none of these are viable candidates.

The inflow was monitored with a planar array of five high-resolution sonic anemometers and supporting <b>meteorological</b> <b>instrumentation</b> located 1. 5 diameters upwind of the turbine. The structural response of the turbine was measured using strain gauges circuits and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The former was used to monitor root bending moments and the low-speed shaft torque, while the latter were used to monitor {{the motion of the}} tower and the nacelle. Auxiliary gauges measured blade pitch, rotor teeter, nacelle yaw and generator power. A total of 3299 10 -minute records were collected for analysis. From this set, 1044 records are used to examine the influence of various inflow parameters on fatigue loads. Long-term fatigue loads and extreme loads are also examined...|$|E
