40|$|Abstract — Transmitter side {{information}} enables {{techniques such as}} beamforming, power control, and rate control in fading channels. It is commonly accepted in the literature that the addition of transmitter information (CSIT) to receiver information (CSIR) provides better performance than receiver information alone. In this work, we examine {{the performance of a}} symmetric, single-input, multiple-output (SIMO) channel in which CSIT is acquired through the use of training symbols, and we have a genie-aided receiver. We give a closed form expression for outage probability at high SNR while accounting for the resources consumed by training. We also analyze the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff and find that, though the diversity falls far below that of systems with perfect CSIT, it is still sufficiently superior to that achieved by CSIR-only systems to justify the cost of training. We show that, at zero <b>multiplexing,</b> <b>transmitter</b> training doubles the diversity order of a CSIR-only system and offers nonzero diversity at all achievable multiplexing gains. I...|$|R

30|$|To {{address the}} {{increasing}} data rate demands for future wireless networks, a dense deployment of base stations or access points {{is the most}} promising approach; however, doing so may cause high intercell interference (ICI). Numerous interference coordination (IC) approaches have been proposed to reduce ICI. Conducting 5 G communication on millimeter wave (mmWave) bands is more complex because of its higher propagation losses and greater attenuation variance, all of which depend on environment change. Massive antenna arrays with beamforming techniques {{can be used to}} overcome high propagation loss, reduce interference, deliver performance gains of coordination without a high overhead, and deliver high network capacity with <b>multiplex</b> <b>transmitters.</b> The central challenge of a massive antenna array that uses beamforming techniques is coordinating the users and beams for each transmitter within a large network. To address this challenge, we propose a novel two-level beamforming coordination approach that partitions a large network into clusters. At the intracluster level, this approach performs intracluster coordination similar to the user selection algorithms in a multiuser multiple input and multiple output (MU-MIMO); doing this maximizes the utility function or minimizes the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) function within a cluster. A dynamic time domain IC approach is employed at the intercluster level, collecting interference information for cluster-edge user equipment (UE) and allocating the UE dynamically among the clusters to reduce the intercluster interference for a switched-beam system (SBS). Simulation results show that the proposed two-level IC approach achieves a higher edge user performance or cell capacity than with the current uncoordinated/coordinated approaches.|$|R
