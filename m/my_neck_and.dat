2500|$|It {{is unclear}} whether {{at that time the}} plague had already arrived in Zealand's northeastern port of Helsingør (Elsinore), where the Sound Dues were {{collected}} from entering ships and where a suspicious series of deaths was reported by the local health commission, allegedly starting with the death in the town on 1 October 1710 of a Dutch passenger arriving from Stockholm. According to Persson (2001), it is [...] "difficult to determine whether their cases have actually been a matter of plague, even if the progress in my eyes seems very suspicious;" [...] while Frandsen (2009) says that [...] "I will risk <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> postulate that the disease in Elsinore in the autumn of 1710 was not the plague but (as the barbers indicate) a form of typhus or spotted fever." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ishida and Abe {{returned}} to Ogu, where they remained until his death. During their love-making this time, Abe put the knife {{to the base}} of Ishida's penis, and said she would make sure he would never play around with another woman. Ishida laughed at this. Two nights into this bout of sex, Abe began choking Ishida, and he told her to continue, saying that this increased his pleasure. She had him do it to her as well. On the evening of May 16, 1936, Abe used her obi sash to cut off Ishida's breathing during orgasm, and they both enjoyed it. They repeated this for two more hours. Once Abe stopped the strangulation, Ishida's face became distorted, and would not return to its normal appearance. Ishida took 30 tablets of a sedative called Calmotin to try to soothe his pain. According to Abe, as Ishida started to doze, he told her, [...] "You'll put the cord around <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> squeeze it again while I'm sleeping, won't you... If you start to strangle me, don't stop, because it is so painful afterward." [...] Abe commented that she wondered if he had wanted her to kill him, but on reflection decided he must have been joking.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{they were}} gone I threw my arms round <b>my</b> comrade's <b>neck,</b> <b>and,</b> resting <b>my</b> head on his shoulder, bemoaned our sad lot.|$|R

60|$|I nearly broke <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> over benches <b>and</b> bats {{getting to}} Whit with that message. He gulped once.|$|R
60|$|She {{clasped her}} arms round <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> laid her cheek fondly against mine.|$|E
60|$|Minnie flung {{her arms}} around <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> kissed me over and over again.|$|E
60|$|Her cheek grew burning hot against <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> {{her arms}} trembled and {{tightened}} round me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{would wait}} {{a little longer than}} to-morrow--there is no knowing what may happen," [...] said Lydgate, with bitter irony. [...] "I may get <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> broken, <b>and</b> that may make things easier to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will excuse my calling so late," [...] she began, and then, {{suddenly}} {{losing her}} self-control, she ran forward, {{threw her arms}} about <b>my</b> wife's <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> sobbed upon her shoulder. [...] "Oh, I'm in such trouble!" [...] she cried; [...] "I do so want a little help." ...|$|R

60|$|So the Lily {{fell upon}} <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> sobbed there, and I {{remember}} that I also wept.|$|E
60|$|Whereon {{she laid}} her kind arms about <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and,</b> despite my manhood, I wept no less than she.|$|E
60|$|She did not answer. One of her arms, {{which was}} hanging over my shoulder, stole round <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> clasped it gently.|$|E
6000|$|... "`Matter!' she exclaimed, `a pretty {{telegraph}} {{yours is}} to be sure! wuss than the old carrier by a long way. Here 'ave I bin standin' for full 'alf-an-hour with <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> nigh broke, <b>and</b> there's no sign of it yet.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you are thinking," [...] she laughed gaily. [...] "That if I were a man you'd wring <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> for me. <b>And</b> I deserve it, too. I'm so sorry. I ought not to keep on hurting your feelings." ...|$|R

60|$|She {{raised her}} eyes to mine, and then her smooth, brown arms encircled <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> drew my lips down to hers.|$|E
60|$|When we {{were again}} in the Mother's Room she threw her arms about <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> burst into a tempest of tears.|$|E

6000|$|And {{the man who}} {{had been}} the child saw his daughter, newly lost to him, a {{celestial}} creature among those three, and he said, 'My daughter's head is on my sister's bosom, and her arm is around <b>my</b> mother's <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> at her feet there is the baby of old time, and I can bear the parting from her, GOD be praised!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You {{can send}} twenty hunters with me,” Subienkow went on. “You see, I must get the berries and the roots {{with which to}} make the {{medicine}}. Then, when you have brought the two sleds and loaded on them the fish and the beaver skins and the rifle, {{and when you have}} told off the six hunters who will go with me—then, when all is ready, I will rub the medicine on <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> so, <b>and</b> lay <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> there on that log. Then can your strongest hunter take the axe and strike three times on <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> You yourself can strike the three times.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Senator Stuart Symington then {{suggested}} that, as with Rob Hall, {{the case}} against Moss might {{be a matter of}} mistaken identity. Moss immediately agreed, saying there were three women named Annie Lee Moss in Washington, D.C. Symington said, [...] "I may be sticking <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> out <b>and</b> I may be wrong, but I've been listening to you testify this afternoon and I think you're telling the truth." [...] Again there was loud and prolonged applause.|$|R

60|$|There was one dreadful {{moment of}} silence. He still held his arms round <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> on {{a sudden he}} put his lips close to my ear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{play the}} fool," [...] I replied sternly. [...] "Come, put {{your right arm}} round <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> hop on your left leg as you never hopped before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have I?" [...] said Mary, {{kneeling}} down on {{the ground}} at her friend's feet. [...] "If I humble myself very low; if I kneel through the whole evening in a corner; if I put <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> down <b>and</b> let all your cousins trample on it, and then your aunt, would not that make atonement? I would not object to wearing sackcloth, either; and I'd eat a little ashes--or, at any rate, I'd try." ...|$|R
60|$|My Aunt Frances {{had dressed}} {{me in my}} best white frock and my crimson sash, with much lamenting over <b>my</b> skinny <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> arms, and bade me behave prettily, as became my {{bringing}} up. So I slipped in a corner, my hands and feet cold with excitement, for I think every drop of blood in my body had gone to my head, and my heart beat so hardly that it even pained me.|$|R
2500|$|In September 2009, it was {{reported}} that Collins could no longer play drums, due to a recent operation to repair dislocated vertebrae in his neck. However, a statement from Collins on the Genesis band website said, [...] "There isn't any drama regarding my 'disability' and playing drums. Somehow, during the last Genesis tour, I dislocated some vertebrae in <b>my</b> upper <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> that affected <b>my</b> hands. After a successful operation on <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>my</b> hands still can't function normally. Maybe in a year or so it will change, but for now it is impossible for me to play drums or piano. I am not in any 'distressed' state, stuff happens in life." ...|$|R
60|$|Obediently she {{followed}} {{me from the}} room, and down the ladder. As we drove away from the grounds she threw her arms about <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> sobbed pitifully.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rise early, and be by {{me all the}} day. There will be {{much work}} on my hands, and I shall be hurt between <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> my shoulder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lazzaro!" [...] It was {{the cry of}} a {{breaking}} heart. Her arms went round <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> in a passion of grief her kisses burned on my lips.|$|E
60|$|I am {{partial to}} a white hat, and I like a shawl round <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> wore loose <b>and</b> easy. Sitting down is my {{favourite}} posture. If I have a taste in point of personal jewelry, it is mother-of-pearl buttons. There you have me again, as large as life.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I 'm {{afraid you}} 'll slip and get hurt.'" [...] 'Don't care if I do; I 'll have those plums if I break <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> doing it,' <b>and</b> half sliding, half walking I {{went down the}} sloping roof, till the boughs of the tree were within my reach.|$|R
60|$|BARBARA. O sir! I don't know, and yet I don't like it.

Why that? It frightens me, Mr. Anthony, it frightens me.|$|R
