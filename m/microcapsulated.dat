40|$|The present {{research}} work was undertaken to formulate and evaluate sustained release coated microcapsules of Phenylephrine HCl for 24 hours. Phenylephrine HCl is sympathomimetic vasoconstrictor {{that has been}} used as a nasal decongestant, having a half life of 2. 5 ± 0. 5 hours and enhance frequent dosing is required to maintain therapeutics plasma concentration. Therefore, sustained release <b>microcapsulated</b> dosage form of Phenylephrine HCl having a release profile upto 24 hours, decrease the frequent dosing and will maintain steady state therapeutics plasma concentration which will also greatly improve patient compliance. Phenylephrine HCl was complexed with cationic resin that is Amberlite IR- 120 and then coated with ethylcellulose to obtain microencapsulated resinate which will be having a release profile up to 24 hours. Chitosan coating was further given to <b>microcapsulated</b> resinate to increase the transit time of the dosage form in the GIT. The optimized formulation was achieved with the ratio 1 : 2. 5 of drug-resin complex and coat/core ratio of 1 : 2 having 6 % w/v ethylcellulose.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{focuses on}} the {{optimizing}} the microstructure to improve the efficiency for healing interfacial debonding in fiber-reinforced polymers (FRPs). Healing is accomplished by incorporating a <b>microcapsulated</b> healing agent and catalytic chemical trigger within a coating layer {{on the surface of}} the fiber strands. Self-healing is demonstrated on flat tensile specimens of unidirectional FRPs. The effects of microcapsule diameter and concentration, and number of filaments in the fiber strand on tensile strength of virgin and healed specimens are discussed. Microstructure of the fracture surfaces of specimens was also examined by a scanning electron microscope. Additionally, finite element analyses were performed to predict the microcapsule-matrix debonding process during uniaxial tensile loading...|$|E
40|$|Cisplatin (CDDP) was <b>microcapsulated</b> with ethylcellulose. Sustained {{release of}} CDDP from the microcapsule, {{particularly}} non-protein-bound CDDP, {{which should have}} antitumour activity, was demonstrated by an in vitro test.

40|$|Drying {{is one of}} the {{standard}} unit operations in the pharmaceutical industry and it is important to become aware of the circumstances that dominate during the process. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test <b>microcapsulated</b> thermochromic pigments as heat indicators in a fluid bed drying process. The indicator powders were manually granulated with α-lactose monohydrate resulting in three particle-size groups. Also, pellets were coated with the indicator powders. The granules and pellets were fluidized in fluid bed dryer to observe the progress of the heat flow in the material and to study the heat indicator properties of the indicator materials. A tristimulus colorimeter was used to measure CIELAB color values. Color indicator for heat detection can be utilized to test if the heat-sensitive API would go through physical changes during the pharmaceutical drying process. Both the prepared granules and pellets can be used as heat indicator in fluid bed drying process.

40|$|A prototypical {{machine with}} control of temperature, {{pressure}} and fluid level {{was set up}} to make <b>microcapsulated</b> artificial diets for mass rearing of Mallada basalis Walker. The best conditions to make microcapsules were obtained by maintaining the temperatures of diet and wax tank at 50 ± 5 ? and 125 ± 5 ?, a pressure of diet tank at 0. 7 - 0. 8 kg/cm 2, and keeping the needle-tip within 1 mm below the wax surface. Under these conditions microcapsules about 465 ?m in diameter and 10 ?m in thickness were produced with 90 % success. When M. basalis larvae were reared with the microencapsulated artificial diets modified from Hassan and Hagen's formula, 90 % of individuals reached the adult stage in 20. 7 days and the females deposited 348. 5 eggs on average. The results were comparable with those from rearing with eggs of Corcyra cephalonica or Aphis glycines.

The {{efficacy}} of any bioartificial liver device requires both rapid production and proper bioactivity {{of the cells}} for the bioreactor. The goal {{of this study was}} to observe the effect of spinner speed and cell density on the proliferation of microencapsulated immortalized human hepatocytes (HepLL) and human hepatoma (HepG 2) cells. Materials and Methods. Alginate-chitosan <b>microcapsulated</b> HepG 2 and HepLL cells were randomly divided into 2 groups, and each group was further divided into 8 subgroups according to embedded cell density and spinner speed. The growth, metabolism, and functions of the encapsulated cells in each group were evaluated. Results. In each group, the cell number, ammonium removal, albumin synthesis, and diazepam clearance increased significantly with the spinner speed, whereas embedded cell density had no impact. Albumin synthesis, removal of ammonium, and diazepam clearance were significantly higher in the microencapsulated HepLL groups than in HepG 2 cells at any time point, without any significant difference in cell numbers. Conclusions. Spinner culture significantly promoted microencapsulated HepLL and HepG 2 cell bioactivity. Wrapped cells had optimal function on day 10 in rolling culture groups. These data show that HepLL cells would be a promising candidate for cell-based liver support therapy...|$|E
40|$|Nanotechnology {{processes}} are present into the textile field. One {{of these processes}} involves encapsulated nanoparticles or nanoproducts, know as microcapsules. Microencapsulation technology is used into textiles to confer new properties and added value. There {{are a lot of}} different active core microcapsules used in the textile industry such as durable fragrances, skin softeners, insect repellents, dyes, vitamins, antimicrobials, phase change materials, etc. The effect of microcapsules is usually measured by the presence of a property such as odour measurements when flavors are encapsulated. Neverthless, some properties such as hydration, antibacterial, insect repellents, etc., can´t be tested without analytical methods. <b>Microcapsulated</b> products can be applied on fabrics by impregnation, bath exhaustion, foam, spraying and coating. The most extended industrial application is by padding. Microcapsules useful life can be affected by fabrics testing and maintenance to which they are subjected during their lifetime. This work studies flavour microcapsules behaviour on plain and knitting fabrics applied by impregnation when these fabrics are subjected an abrasion test. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been used in order to determinate the quantity of microencapsulated products that remains on fabrics after abrasion tests. We concluded that the abrasion resistance test destroy the microcapsules deposited on fabrics.

40|$|Gelatin-starch syrup (food grade) microcapsulation {{was applied}} for {{toxicology}} studies of bromodichloromethane (BDCM). BDCM concentrations were stable for 120 days in the microcapsules and for 9 months when incorporated in the powder diet. BDCM concentration in the blood following the administration of microcapsules in olive oil suspension was retained at higher levels than when BDCM was administered as olive oil solution. Subsequently, the microcapsules were mixed in powder diet and were given at concentrations of <b>microcapsulated</b> BDCM of 0, 0. 024, 0. 072, and 0. 215 % to groups of 7 male Wistar rats for 1 month. For comparison, BDCM dissolved in olive oil was administered by gavage to groups of 7 male rats for 1 month at dosage levels adjusted {{to those in the}} feeding study (0, 20, 60, and 180 mg/kg body weight). Suppression of body weight gain was seen in the high-dosage groups in both the feeding and the gavage studies and was more severe in the former. Similar histopathologic lesions in the liver were shown in both studies, including vacuolization, swelling, and single necrosis of liver cells. Hepatic cord irregularity and bile duct proliferation were observed in the feeding study but not the gavage study. Serum biochemical changes, such as decreases in glucose, triglyceride, and cholinesterase levels, which reflected the histopathologic findings in the liver, were also observed in both studies. Accordingly, the microcapsulation process was proved to pose no qualitative toxic effects on toxicity of BDCM in short-term toxicity studies.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{study the}} preparative method of {{controlled}} release microspheres incorporating {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF) and the bioactivities of bFGF, which were released from bFGF microspheres, on the cultured Schwann cells. MethodsbFGF was <b>microcapsulated</b> with the multiple emulsion encapsulative method using polylactic-coglycolic acid (PLGA) as coating material. Its morphology, particle size distribution, drug loading, enveloping rate and in vitro release property were studied. The cultured Schwann cells were grouped {{according to the}} different ingredients being added to the culture medium of bFGF group or bFGF-PLGA group. Then the cytometry, cytoactivity detection and mitotic cycle analysis of Schwann cells were performed. ResultsThe morphology and the particle size distribution of the bFGF-PLGA microspheres were even and good. The drug loading and enveloping rate of microspheres were (27. 18 × 10 − 3) % ± (0. 51 × 10 − 3) % and 66. 43 % ± 1. 24 %. The release property of microspheres in vitro was good and the overall release rate was 72. 47 % in 11 days. The in vitro cellular study showed that: at the first 2 days of plate culture, the cell number and viability of the bFGF group were statistically higher than the bFGF-PLGA group; at the 3 rd and 4 th days of plate culture, the cell number and viability of bFGF and bFGF-PLGA groups showed no difference; at the 6 th and 8 th days of the plate culture, the cell number and viability of the bFGF-PLGA group were statistically higher than the bFGF group. By flow cytometry examination, at the 2 nd day of plate culture, the G 2 /M + S percentage of bFGF group was statistically higher than the bFGF-PLGA group, at the 4 th and 8 th days of plate culture, the G 2 /M + S percentage of the bFGF-PLGA group was statistically higher than the bFGF group. ConclusionsIt is practical to prepare the bFGF-PLGA microspheres with the multiple emulsion encapsulative method. bFGF-PLGA microspheres can preserve the bioactivities of bFGF effectively and promote the proliferation of Schwann cells in a long period because of the controlled release of bFGF from the microspheres...|$|E
