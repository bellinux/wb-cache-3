5000|$|Having {{multiple}} file {{systems on}} a single system has the additional benefit that {{in the event of}} a corruption of a single partition, the remaining file systems will frequently still be intact. This includes virus destruction of the system partition or even a system that will not boot. File system utilities which require dedicated access can be effectively completed piecemeal. In addition, defragmentation may be more effective. Several system maintenance utilities, such as virus scans and backups, can also be processed in segments. For example, it is not necessary to backup the file system containing videos along with all the other files if none have been added since the last backup. As for the image files, one can easily [...] "spin off" [...] differential images which contain only [...] "new" [...] data written to the <b>master</b> (<b>original)</b> image. Differential images can be used for both safety concerns (as a [...] "disposable" [...] system - can be quickly restored if destroyed or contaminated by a virus, as the old image can be removed and a new image can be created in matter of seconds, even without automated procedures) and quick virtual machine deployment (since the differential images can be quickly spawned using a script in batches).|$|E
