5|$|Euler {{was one of}} {{the most}} eminent mathematicians of the 18th century and is held to be one of the {{greatest}} in history. He is also widely considered to be the most prolific mathematician of all time. His collected works fill 60 to 80 quarto volumes, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> in the field. He spent most of his adult life in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and in Berlin, then the capital of Prussia.|$|E
5|$|The Gepids were a major Germanic {{people in}} what is now eastern Hungary, western Romania, and {{northern}} Serbia. Although the details of his early life are not known, Thurisind is believed to have risen to power in about 548. After the death of Elemund, the previous king, he seized the throne in a coup d'état and forced Elemund's son Ostrogotha into exile. Ostrogotha and his followers found refuge among the Gepids' neighbours and enemies, the Lombards, another Germanic people who had just settled {{in the western part of}} the Pannonian Basin. The Gepids had inhabited parts of the basin since the 3rd century. They reached prominence in the 5th century when, under King Ardaric, they played a key role in destroying the Hunnic Empire. Ardaric and his people benefited <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> else from this victory, gaining the former Roman province of Dacia.|$|E

25|$|Few, {{even in the}} Labour Party, gave Robinson {{much chance}} of winning the presidency, not least because of an {{internal}} party row over her nomination. With the Labour Party the first name for a possible candidate was an elderly former minister for Health, and hero to the left, Noel Browne. Browne was a household name for having done <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> else in Ireland for tackling Tuberculosis in the 1950s. However Browne's relationship with the Labour Party had been stormy. He was critical of its ties with Fine Gael and had co-founded the short lived Socialist Labour Party in 1977 after leaving the Labour Party. Although he was supported by left wing members within Labour such as Michael D. Higgins, he {{had little or no}} contact with Dick Spring and therefore had to live in hope of being nominated without the endorsement of the party leadership. The possibility that Browne might be nominated raised the possibility of an internal argument within the party. The fact that Browne was enthusiastic for candidacy, in a contest where Labour never before contested, now acted as pressure for Labour to find a candidate. Spring did not feel that he could control Browne {{for the duration of the}} election, given Browne's history of defying party policy to such a degree that Browne had to leave several political parties. In these circumstances the decision to propose Robinson proved to be politically inspired. Robinson had an advantage in being the first candidate nominated for the election (and the first female), in that she could cover more meetings, public addresses and interviews. However she refused to be drawn on specifics in case she would alienate possible support. Robinson also received the backing of the Irish Times newspaper, and this proved hugely advantageous.|$|E
25|$|The 1958-59 Ashes {{series was}} {{the end of an era}} in English cricket; after losing 4–0 in Australia Trevor Bailey, Godfrey Evans, Frank Tyson and Barrington's Surrey {{teammates}} Jim Laker and Peter Loader all retired from Test cricket. The team needed to be rebuilt and a solid batsman was needed to shore up the top order. Peter May took leave to get married and Arthur McIntyre took over as wicketkeeper-captain of Surrey. An earlier attempt to turn Barrington into an opener had failed, but McIntyre promoted him to number 3 in the order to stop him getting nervous while pacing around the dressing room waiting to bat. He made 97 against Cambridge University soon followed by 186 and 118 not out against Warwickshire at Edgbaston; 85 and 59 not out against the Indians at the Oval and 113 not out against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. This earned him a recall to the England cricket team against a weak Indian side, perfect for playing a batsman into a Test career. In the First Test at Trent Bridge he joined his Surrey and England captain Peter May at 63/3 and was told not to worry about scoring as long as he fought it out. Barrington took 20 minutes to get off the mark, but hit two sixes off Chandu Borde to bring up his 50 and was out for 56 in a stand of 175 as England won by an innings. In the Second Test at Lord's England were 100/7 when Barrington top-scored with 80, adding 126 for the last three wickets to set up another big win. The Third Test at Headingley saw him making 80 again, this time adding 193 runs with Colin Cowdrey in an 8 wicket victory. The Fourth Test at Old Trafford gave him 87 as his missed out on another century, but captain Colin Cowdrey gave him the ball and he took 3/36 with his leg-spin. In the second innings he was told to go for quick runs and hit 46 in 36 minutes with 6 fours and a six, then wrapped things up with 2/75 and a catch as England won by 171 runs. Back home at the Oval for the Fifth Test Barrington was out for 8, but England completed the 5–0 whitewash with an innings victory. Barrington made 357 runs (59.50) in the series – <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> else – and had had his most prolific summer with 2,499 first-class runs (54.32), but Surrey failed to win the County Championship for the first time in 8 years, coming third. His consistent run-making won him the honour of being named one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year and he was an automatic choice for the forthcoming tour of the West Indies in 1959–60.|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{nonetheless}} {{became the}} target of rough physical play by opponents (particularly the Cardinals). At one time, he received a seven-inch gash in his leg from Enos Slaughter. On April 22, 1947, during a game between the Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies, Phillies players and manager Ben Chapman called Robinson a [...] "nigger" [...] from their dugout and yelled that he should [...] "go back to the cotton fields". Rickey later recalled that Chapman [...] "did <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> to unite the Dodgers. When he poured out that string of unconscionable abuse, he solidified and united thirty men." ...|$|E

500|$|West was an {{all-around}} combo {{guard who}} could take the playmaking roles of a point guard and score like a shooting guard, while being equally strong on offense and on defense. He had a jump shot with a release the NBA lauded as [...] "lightning quick", and was known for making baskets late in the game, earning him the nickname [...] "Mr. Clutch". Having played forward early in his career, West was also a capable rebounder, and gifted with long arms, quick hands and strong defensive instincts, West was also once described {{as one of the}} best ball hawks, man-to-man defenders and shot blockers among NBA guards: when the All-Defensive Teams were introduced in 1969, West made every one of them until his career ended in 1974. [...] "He stole <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody,</b> although they didn't keep records on it then", said Sharman. However, contemporaries were most impressed by West's work ethic, obsessively practicing and shooting and rarely being satisfied with himself.|$|E

He voiced Mermaid Man, {{until his death}} in 2012. Following his death, Nickelodeon honored him with a two-hour SpongeBob SquarePants marathon featuring his character. Borgnine had found a renewed fanbase among children through his work on the show. Borgnine's former McHale's Navy co-star Conway has made over 15 guest appearances as Barnacle Boy, Mermaid Man's sidekick. Actress Marion Ross first appeared as Grandma SquarePants in the season two episode [...] "Grandma's Kisses," [...] and has since appeared in three other episodes. Actor John O'Hurley provides the voice of King Neptune, who first appeared in the first-season episode [...] "Neptune's Spatula," [...] while John Rhys-Davies made his first appearance as Man Ray, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's nemesis, in the second-season episode [...] "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III."

500|$|Several guest {{stars have}} made {{multiple}} appearances on the show, often as recurring characters. Actor Phil Hartman guest-starred in 52 episodes, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> else, although his initial {{role in the}} second season episode [...] "Bart Gets Hit By a Car" [...] in 1991 {{was intended to be}} a one-off. He voiced the recurring characters Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz as well as numerous other one-time characters, until his death in 1998. McClure and Hutz were subsequently retired from the show. Actor Kelsey Grammer first appeared as Sideshow Bob in the first-season episode [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] while actor Joe Mantegna made his first appearance as Fat Tony in the third season episode [...] "Bart the Murderer". The two have appeared in 14 and 25 episodes respectively; Mantegna also appeared in the film. Both roles were originally written for other actors: Bob was originally to be voiced by James Earl Jones, who later guest starred three times on the show, while Fat Tony was written for Sheldon Leonard.

500|$|Stone Rollin expands on the Motown-inspired {{material}} of Saadiq's previous album and includes various other R styles. Along with mid-tempo soul songs, Stone Rollin features styles such as early R rock and roll, rock-inspired funk, Chess Records-blues, {{and the more}} expansive orchestral sound of post-Detroit Motown and 1970s Philadelphia soul. Disc jockey Chris Douridas described Saadiq's sound as [...] "a hybrid form that's rooted in these familiar elements from classic soul but recontextualized with a modern sound". Nick Butler of Sputnikmusic called the album's songs [...] "belters" [...] and [...] "guitar-heavy", and wrote of its musical influences, [...] "While Prince informs the sound of this <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody,</b> it's a very early-'70s sounding album on the whole [...] but there are influences that go back even further than that - Ray Charles and Little Richard in particular inform some of this record's more energetic moments." [...] Los Angeles Times journalist Mikael Wood said of the album's sound and production, [...] "Where Saadiq's previous efforts luxuriated in the layering and the fine-tuning made possible by modern recording gear, Stone Rollin presents a rawer, rowdier soul-rock sound modeled after his energetic stage show".|$|E
500|$|The lyrics for {{the album}} were all written by Radke during his imprisonment. He has {{often called the}} album a breakup record, but with a band and not a girl. Radke said that, [...] "I would think all day, for days and days, [...] what people would want to hear. I would dissect my old album and read all the fan letters and the reasons why they loved my band and why they listened to it. And I wrote about that, but in {{different}} ways. I don’t know why these kids love the tragedies that I write about. I guess they can relate to it." [...] Also on the writing process, Radke said that his lyrics were much more evolved than his past works and that he felt this was a high-point for the post-hardcore genre, owing success to being incarcerated and writing lyrics for two years with no other musical influences. The title, The Drug in Me Is You, came from Radke's experiences concerning his previous self-destructive behavior, which Radke explained that, [...] "We named it that because ... It's me, looking in the mirror, saying, 'I am my own worst [...] I do the worst damage to myself — <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> else can to do me.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Rivera is well {{respected}} throughout baseball for his professionalism. Fellow closer Joe Nathan said, [...] "I {{look up to}} how he's handled himself {{on and off the}} field... You never see him show up anyone and he respects the game. I've always looked up to him and it's always a compliment to be just mentioned in the same sentence as him." [...] Michael Young said of Rivera, [...] "I respect Mo <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> in the game. The guy goes out there, gets three outs and shakes [...] Posada's hand. You appreciate someone who respects the game like he does, respects the people he plays with and against, and obviously his results speak for themselves." [...] In a Sports Illustrated cover story about Rivera that was published in the final week of his career, Verducci said of the pitcher, [...] "Few players in any sport have retired with more reverence from his peers." [...] Rivera was the last MLB player to wear the uniform number 42 on a regular basis; {{at the time of his}} retirement, he was the only active player still grandfathered by the league to wear Jackie Robinson's retired number. Speaking about Rivera's connection to her husband, Robinson's widow Rachel said, [...] " [...] carried himself with dignity and grace, and that made carrying the number a tribute to Jack... I've always been proud and pleased that Mariano was the one chosen to wear that number because I think he brought something special to it." [...] Presenting him with the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award, Selig said: [...] "Throughout his illustrious career, he has represented his family, his country, the Yankees and all of Major League Baseball with the utmost class and dignity. It is wholly appropriate that Mariano was the last Major League player to wear Jackie Robinson's sacred number 42." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Los Angeles Times critic {{wrote that}} Morrissey [...] "patented the {{template}} for modern indie rock" [...] {{and that many}} bands playing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival [...] "would not be there—or at least, would not sound the same—were it not for him". Similarly, the critic Steven Wells called Morrissey [...] "the man who more or less invented indie" [...] and an artist [...] "who <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> else personifies" [...] indie culture. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic writes that the Smiths and Morrissey [...] "inspired every band of note" [...] in the Britpop era, including Suede, Blur, Oasis, and Pulp.

2500|$|In {{his short}} story {{collection}} A Century of Great Suspense Stories, editor Jeffery Deaver noted that King [...] "singlehandedly made popular fiction grow up. While {{there were many}} good best-selling writers before him, King, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anybody</b> since John D. MacDonald, brought reality to genre novels. He has often remarked that 'Salem's Lot was [...] "Peyton Place meets Dracula. And so it was. The rich characterization, the careful and caring social eye, the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again. Before King, many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious blue-penciled by their editors. ‘Stuff like that {{gets in the way}} of the story,' they were told. Well, it's stuff like that that has made King so popular, and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing. He is a master of masters." ...|$|E

Then Allah's Apostle {{got up and went}} away, and I too, followed him till he reached the door of 'Aisha's room.
