40|$|Two new Finnish {{mitigation}} guides {{have been}} issued. The first guide gives basic information and practical examples on all mitigation {{methods and results}} achieved. The second guide is a detailed guide for design and implementation of sub-slab-depressurization (SSD) in low-rise residential houses. The presentation includes many examples from the guide for SSD and radon well and other methods. The most efficient methods are SSD and radon well, typical radon concentration reduction factors being 70 - 90 %. Radon well is effective only on soils where air permeability is high enough; e. g., on gravel and in esker areas. A single radon well can reduce radon concentration in many dwellings at a distance up to 20 - 30 <b>meters.</b> <b>Sealing</b> entry routes and ventilation or pressure-reduction-based measures resulted in lower reduction factors but {{play an important role}} in mitigation practices. The national prevention guide and results achieved are presented. The guide is based on the following measures: use of bitumen felt in the joint of foundation wall and floor slab, sealing of penetrations and installation of radon piping.

40|$|Application of sealing {{materials}} {{is done in}} order to prevent water leakage into cavities of the car body, and to reduce noise. The complexity of the sealing spray process is characterised by multi-phase and free surface flows, multi-scale phenomena, and large moving geometries, which poses great challenges for mathematical modelling and simulation. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a novel framework that includes detailed process simulation and automatic generation of collision free robot paths. To verify the simulations, the resulting width, thickness and shape of applied material on test plates as a function of time and spraying distance have been compared to experiments. The agreement is in general very good. The efficient implementation makes it possible to simulate application of one <b>meter</b> of <b>sealing</b> material in less than an hour on a standard computer, and it is therefore feasible to include such detailed simulations in the production preparation process and off -line programming of the sealing robots...|$|R

Iron sulfides and iron oxides significantly damage components from {{the origin of the}} pipeline to the final product delivery because prior to precipitation, they are at and below sub-micron levels, therefore undetectable when passing through sensors and meters.

5000|$|Torricelli's chief {{invention}} was {{the mercury}} barometer. [...] "This instrument is named from two Greek words, signifying two measures of weight, since by it {{a column of}} air is weighed against a column of mercury." [...] The barometer arose from the need to solve a practical problem. Pump makers of the Grand Duke of Tuscany attempted to raise water to a height of 12 meters or more, but found that 10 meters was the limit with a suction pump (as recounted in Galileo's Dialogue). Torricelli employed mercury, thirteen times more dense than water. In 1643 he created a tube approximately one <b>meter</b> long, <b>sealed</b> at the top, filled it with mercury, and set it vertically into a basin of mercury. The column of mercury fell to about 76 cm, leaving a Torricellian vacuum above. As we now know, the column's height fluctuated with changing atmospheric pressure; {{this was the first}} barometer. The discovery of the principle of the barometer has perpetuated his fame ("Torricellian tube", [...] "Torricellian vacuum"). The torr, a unit of pressure used in vacuum measurements, is named after him. [...] "12 years before Torricelli's observations, Descartes, the French philosopher, had made the same observation, although he {{does not appear to have}} turned it to any account." ...|$|R
