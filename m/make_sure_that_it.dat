Miller designed the liner notes and packaging, which included English translations {{of the language}} found in the game. Whereas the music to Myst was, at first, only available by mail-order from Cyan, Virgin Records had bought the rights to release it initially, prompting Miller to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could stand alone in CD form. The compact disc was released on February 24, 1998, with 54minutes of music.|$|E
5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. When writing the episodes, Takumi ranked each after its importance: the first episode was the most important, to make sure that the player likes the game; the second episode was the second most important, to solidify the player's interest; and the finale was the third most important. In general, each scenario was finished before anything else was done; after this, characters were designed based on the scenarios, and then Takumi adjusted dialogue as needed to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> fit the designs. At this point, it was also decided what scenes were going to have specific cut-in illustrations made for them; Takumi drew rough sketches of them, and also drew the storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consist of series of detailed drawings that show what is happening.|$|E

25|$|Several BFS {{personnel}} were honoured for their work. Jack Owen, a BFS officer and former Royal Marine, was awarded an MBE in 1963 following a tense incident at Bohldamm near Lüchow in Lower Saxony. The border ran along a stream, but its precise location was disputed. The West Germans considered {{the far side}} of the stream to be the location of the border, while the East Germans regarded the border as lying in the middle of the stream. An overgrown cobbled footbridge crossed the stream but was blocked by the East Germans with a movable barbed wire trestle barrier situated at the far end of the bridge. One day in 1962 the East Germans moved the barrier to the middle of the bridge, despite protests from West German border guards and customs officials. The situation escalated when the East Germans warned that they would shoot anyone who touched the trestle and backed up their warning by emplacing machine guns and armoured cars on their side of the stream. The West Germans called up a BFS platoon and a British Army section to back them up. Owen called the East Germans' bluff by walking onto the bridge with two British soldiers and carrying the trestle back to the eastern side of the stream. He then stood by it for the next eight hours to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would not be moved again.|$|E

500|$|Development on {{the level}} editor began in May 1995. The first-person view was {{developed}} in September 1995, and the creatures had shadows added, which was believed impossible at the time. Around that time, Barnes left the project to complete a degree at the University of East Anglia, and returned in July 1996. In November 1995, Barrie Parker began writing levels, and developed content for the script language. Bullfrog {{tried to get a}} version out for Christmas 1995: it was originally scheduled for release in November 1995, and Molyneux, until September, believed that it would be ready by Christmas. He explained that it was mostly complete, but wanted to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "absolutely brilliant". It was then the development team realised the game should focus on a living world created by the player.|$|E

According to him, the band had no deadline, which allowed them not to feel pressured into finishing something. Once a proper deadline was imposed onto the band, they became more productive than in previous sessions. At this juncture, the band had written [...] "about 14 or 15 songs". Martin added that {{the reason why they}} ended up late was that they [...] "...kept [...] finishing [...] the record until it was way too late... don't listen to it at the moment, because [...] just find something to go back and change." ...|$|E

She enlisted then-playwright Phyllis Nagy to write the screenplay at the recommendation of her London agent. Nagy, who was a friend of Highsmith, wrote the first draft of the script in 1997. Highsmith had suggested to Nagy she adapt one of her novels. According to Nagy, Highsmith was not confident that the novel could be made into a [...] "satisfying" [...] film because of its [...] "intense, subjective point of view". Nagy decided to adapt the script to ensure its fidelity to the source material, remarking, [...] "I felt a strange responsibility to take it, and to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> wasn't screwed up in some fundamental way, because she so disliked many of the screen adaptations of her work." ...|$|E

Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh, and Christopher Finnegan animated it at Screen Novelties, while Caballero and Walsh served as the directors. Screen Novelties was chosen by the show's executives to execute the animation because they had already worked with them before in other several smaller projects. These include the revamping of the opening title sequence of the show for 2009's SpongeBob's Truth or Square. Walsh explained, [...] "They dug one of our shorts that we'd done a while back, which was called Graveyard Jamboree with Mysterious Mose, and wanted to have us apply our sensibilities to SpongeBob ...

500|$|During the localization, Bateman had to {{keep track}} of the {{numerous}} plot points throughout the game, as the script had not been written in chronological order due to the numerous endings. Localizing the game took roughly two months. Another big challenge was getting the localization done in time: Nobara Nakayama, the game's translator, worked on it for 30 days, and the editing process took two months. Because of this, Bateman had to do most of the work [...] "on the fly". Nakayama had started playing the game prior to starting work on the localization, but did not finish playing it until she was more than halfway through translating it; after learning that the plot hinged on a Japanese pun, they had to halt the localization, discuss it with Uchikoshi, come up with a solution, and go through the whole game to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> still made sense.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} the story was that while each case is a {{standalone}} episode, they are also all interlinked, forming a larger mystery, with each episode revealing {{a piece of the}} puzzle. Because Edgeworth is portrayed as a genius prosecutor, whereas Phoenix Wright is a rookie attorney, the development team felt that they needed to come up with incidents that were larger in scale for Ace Attorney Investigations, to match Edgeworth's skill level; therefore, the opponents were made [...] "more formidable" [...] compared to the ones in previous games in the series. Eshiro saw the story as {{the most important part of}} the game, and said that, while time consuming, it was important to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> works. This was accomplished through a lot of trial and error, and several rewrites and revisions: Yamazaki would come up with an idea, which was tested to see if players had a hard time understanding it. Based on feedback from the testers, Yamazaki would rewrite and reorder some parts, and add hints. When creating the game's story, the development team took into account that some players might not have played any Ace Attorney games before. Because of this, they tried to make the game as accessible as possible, and make it playable without first having played any of the previous titles; for instance, the first part of the game is a tutorial that introduces the game and the characters. They did however add in-jokes for players who had played previous Ace Attorney games. Kay Faraday was the first new character that was created for the game, and was cited by Eshiro as one of his favorite characters.|$|E
