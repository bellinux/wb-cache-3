5|$|There {{are five}} major {{pathways}} {{in the brain}} connecting other brain areas with the basal ganglia. These are known as the motor, oculo-motor, associative, limbic and orbitofrontal circuits, with names indicating the main projection area of each circuit. All of them are affected in PD, and their disruption explains many of the symptoms of the disease, since these circuits {{are involved in a}} wide variety of functions, including movement, attention and learning. Scientifically, the <b>motor</b> <b>circuit</b> has been examined the most intensively.|$|E
5|$|The basal ganglia—the part of {{the brain}} most {{prominently}} affected in early HD—play a key role in movement and behavior control. Their functions are not fully understood, but current theories propose that they are {{part of the}} cognitive executive system and the <b>motor</b> <b>circuit.</b> The basal ganglia ordinarily inhibit a large number of circuits that generate specific movements. To initiate a particular movement, the cerebral cortex sends a signal to the basal ganglia that causes the inhibition to be released. Damage to the basal ganglia can cause the release or reinstatement of the inhibitions to be erratic and uncontrolled, which results in an awkward start to motion or motions to be unintentionally initiated, or a motion to be halted before, or beyond, its intended completion. The accumulating damage to this area causes the characteristic erratic movements associated with HD. The spontaneous and erratic physical movements associated with HD are classified as a type of hyperkinetic dysarthria. Because of the basal ganglia's inability to inhibit movements, individuals affected by it will inevitably experience a reduced ability to produce speech and swallow foods and liquids (dysphagia).|$|E

25|$|The Brooklands <b>motor</b> <b>circuit</b> (or race track) was {{the brainchild}} of Hugh F. Locke King, and was the first {{purpose-built}} banked motor race circuit in the world. Following the Motor Car Act 1903, Britain was subject to a blanket 20mph (32km/h) speed limit on public roads: at a time when nearly 50% of the world's new cars were produced in France, there was concern that Britain's infant auto-industry would be hampered by the inability to undertake sustained high speed testing.|$|E
25|$|By 1971, the {{ownership}} of Brands Hatch was {{in the hands of}} <b>Motor</b> <b>Circuit</b> Developments (MCD), which saw the arrival of another MCD-inspired single-seater formula in the shape of Formula Atlantic. The BOAC 1000 saw Alfa Romeo take their first major success in 20 years, with the chequered flag being taken by the 33TT3 of Andrea de Adamich and Henri Pescarolo, who completed the 235 laps at a speed of 97.17mph. They were followed home by the Ferrari 312PB of Jacky Ickx and Clay Regazzoni, with the Porsche 917 of Jo Siffert and Derek Bell a further three laps down in third.|$|E
40|$|Distinctive cortico-striatal <b>circuits</b> {{that serve}} <b>motor</b> and {{cognitive}} functions have been recently mapped based on resting state connectivity. It {{has been reported}} that age differences in cortico-striatal connectivity relate to cognitive declines in aging. Moreover, children in their early teens (i. e., youth) already show mature motor network patterns while their cognitive networks are still developing. In the current study, we examined age differences in the frontal-striatal ?cognitive? and ?<b>motor?</b> <b>circuits</b> in children and adolescence, young adults (YAs), and older adults (OAs). We predicted that the strength of the ?cognitive? frontal-striatal circuits would follow an inverted ?U? pattern across age; children and OAs would have weaker connectivity than YAs. However, we predicted that the ?<b>motor?</b> <b>circuits</b> would show less variation in connectivity strength across the lifespan. We found that most areas in both the ?cognitive? and ?<b>motor?</b> <b>circuits</b> showed higher connectivity in YAs than children and OAs, suggesting general inverted ?U?-shaped changes across the lifespan for both the cognitive and motor frontal-striatal networks...|$|R
40|$|Action and {{perception}} are functionally linked in the brain, but a hotly debated {{question is whether}} perception and comprehension of stimuli depend on <b>motor</b> <b>circuits.</b> Brain language mechanisms are ideal for addressing this question. Neuroimaging investigations have found specific motor activations when subjects understand speech sounds, word meanings and sentence structures. Moreover, studies involving transcranial magnetic stimulation and patients with lesions affecting inferior frontal regions of the brain have shown contributions of <b>motor</b> <b>circuits</b> to the comprehension of phonemes, semantic categories and grammar. These data show that language comprehension benefits from frontocentral action systems, indicating that action {{and perception}} circuits are interdependent...|$|R

25|$|In October that year, rumours {{started to}} {{circulate}} regarding {{the future of}} <b>Motor</b> <b>Circuit</b> Developments; {{at the time the}} property of Eagle Star Holdings which had been sold to British American Tobacco.

He was the Chairman of Atlantic Computers plc and a staunch enthusiast and Historic and Thundersports racer. His bid of £5.25m secured the future of Brands Hatch, Oulton Park and Snetterton for 'the foreseeable future'. Early in 1987, he added Cadwell Park to his fold which was now known as the Brands Hatch Leisure Group.|$|E
500|$|A {{particular}} {{conceptual model}} of the <b>motor</b> <b>circuit</b> and its alteration with PD has been of great influence since 1980, although some limitations have been pointed out which have led to modifications. In this model, the basal ganglia normally exert a constant inhibitory influence {{on a wide range}} of motor systems, preventing them from becoming active at inappropriate times. When a decision is made to perform a particular action, inhibition is reduced for the required motor system, thereby releasing it for activation. Dopamine acts to facilitate this release of inhibition, so high levels of dopamine function tend to promote motor activity, while low levels of dopamine function, such as occur in PD, demand greater exertions of effort for any given movement. Thus, the net effect of dopamine depletion is to produce hypokinesia, an overall reduction in motor output. [...] Drugs that are used to treat PD, conversely, may produce excessive dopamine activity, allowing motor systems to be activated at inappropriate times and thereby producing dyskinesias.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{new style}} of psychology, later dubbed {{functional}} psychology, had a practical emphasis on action and application. In Dewey's article [...] "The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology" [...] {{which appeared in}} Psychological Review in 1896, he reasons against the traditional stimulus-response understanding of the reflex arc {{in favor of a}} [...] "circular" [...] account in which what serves as [...] "stimulus" [...] and what as [...] "response" [...] depends on how one considers the situation, and defends the unitary nature of the sensory <b>motor</b> <b>circuit.</b> While he does not deny the existence of stimulus, sensation, and response, he disagreed that they were separate, juxtaposed events happening like links in a chain. He developed {{the idea that there is}} a coordination by which the stimulation is enriched by the results of previous experiences. The response is modulated by sensorial experience.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} for {{identification}} of <b>motor</b> equivalent <b>circuit</b> parameters is proposed based on motor nameplate and {{particle swarm optimization}} (PSO). That is effective solution to the present problems of <b>motor</b> equivalent <b>circuit</b> parameters identification method. An accurate <b>motor</b> equivalent <b>circuit</b> is built by introducing an equivalent stray-loss resistance, mechanical loss, and slip loss of ring brushes contact for wound motor. The identification accuracy of <b>motor</b> equivalent <b>circuit</b> parameters is improved. An identification optimization model of equivalent circuit is established based on motor nameplate parameters and <b>motor</b> equivalent <b>circuit’s</b> calculating parameters. With PSO for solving optimization model is achieved a higher probability optimization goals. Finally, a group of equivalent circuit parameters {{to achieve the objective}} function value is randomly selected. The motor electrical parameters is calculated at different speeds with the equivalent circuit identified parameters and compared with the measured values. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed parameter identification method based on motor nameplate parameters and combining PSO optimization method is effective...|$|R
