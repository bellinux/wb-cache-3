25|$|The {{cause of}} {{executive}} dysfunction is heterogeneous, as many neurocognitive processes {{are involved in}} the executive system and each may be compromised by a range of genetic and environmental factors. Learning and development of long-term <b>memory</b> <b>play</b> a role in the severity of executive dysfunction through dynamic interaction with neurological characteristics. Studies in cognitive neuroscience suggest that executive functions are widely distributed throughout the brain, though a few areas have been isolated as primary contributors. Executive dysfunction is studied extensively in clinical neuropsychology as well, allowing correlations to be drawn between such dysexecutive symptoms and their neurological correlates.|$|E

50|$|<b>Memory</b> <b>plays</b> a {{major role}} in the tellability of a story, as {{memories}} are constantly changing and the lack of memory can often impede on the tellability of a story.

They explain that as people grow older their memories of the past change and therefore the very means by which the story changes. Some stories lose tellability as they are forgotten, others lose tellability in how the memory of them are so fragmented that they cannot be told as a story. In other instances people grow so far away from these certain memories that they no longer seem applicable or important to tell.|$|R

The management of concurrent access to message queues is {{an important aspect of}} design for shared memory messagepassing systems.

The paper presents a new lock-free algorithm that provides many of the advantages of nonblocking algorithms while avoiding the overhead of true non-blocking behavior. The lock-free algorithm couples synchronization tightly to the data structure and demonstrates application performance superior to all others studied. The success of this algorithm implies that other practical problems might also benefit from a reexamination of the nonblocking literature. 1.

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} now demonstrates that working <b>memory</b> <b>plays</b> an important role in controlling the extent to which irrelevant visual distractors are processed during visual selective attention tasks (e. g., Lavie, Hirst, De Fockert, & Viding, 2004). Recently, {{it has been shown that}} the successful selection of tactile information also depends on the availability of working memory (Dalton, Lavie, & Spence, 2009). Here, we investigate whether working <b>memory</b> <b>plays</b> a role in auditory selective attention. Participants focused their attention on short continuous bursts of white noise (targets) while attempting to ignore pulsed bursts of noise (distractors). Distractor interference in this auditory task, as measured in terms of the difference in performance between congruent and incongruent distractor trials, increased significantly under high (vs. low) load in a concurrent working-memory task. These results provide the first evidence demonstrating a causal role for working memory in reducing interference by irrelevant auditory distractors...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{role that}} our long-term <b>memories</b> <b>play</b> in guiding perception is increasingly recognized, but the functional and neural mechanisms {{are just beginning}} to be explored. Although experimental approaches are being developed to investigate the influence of long-term memories on perception, these remain mostly static and neglect their temporal and dynamic nature. Here, we show that our long-term memories can guide attention proactively and dynamically based on learned temporal associations. Across two experiments, we found that detection and discrimination of targets appearing within previously learned contexts are enhanced when the timing of target appearance matches the learned temporal contingency. Neural markers of temporal preparation revealed that the learned temporal associations trigger specific temporal predictions. Our findings emphasize the ecological role that <b>memories</b> <b>play</b> in predicting and preparing perception of anticipated events, calling for revision of the usual conceptualization of contextual associative memory as a reflective and retroactive function...|$|R
