2500|$|For {{control of}} fascioloidosis in wild ruminants, {{successful}} application of anthelminthics in feed is necessary. The drug {{has to have}} flavour and smell that do not prevent animals from eating <b>medicated</b> <b>feed.</b> In addition, there should adequate therapeutic scope, i.e. span between therapeutic and minimal toxic dose. Therefore, only some of anthelminthics that are efficient in domestic ruminants have been tested in wild ruminants infected with F. magna. Several drugs, namely oxyclozanide, rafoxanide, albendazole, diamphenetide, closantel, clorsulon, and triclabendazole, {{have been used in}} control of F. magna infection in cervids. However, the results have differed between different authors. In the same way as for F. hepatica, triclabendazole seems to be the most effective against F. magna. Fascioloidosis of cervids was successfully controlled with triclabendazole in USA, and [...] triclabendazole with levamizole in Hungary, Canada, Austria, and Croatia. In contrast, rafoxanide is commonly used in treatment in Czech Republic [...] Slovakia [...] and Hungary. Nevertheless, recent studies suggested that use of rafoxanide in control of F. magna infection should be considered. Unfortunately, rafoxanide in a commercial drug called Rafendazol Premix is the only registered drug for wild ruminants. Triclabendazole and others are produced as drugs for domestic animals and it can be used in free-living animals only with special permit. In some cases, {{it may be difficult to}} determine if F. magna or a different fluke such as Fasciola hepatica or Fasciola gigantica is causing pathology since all these flukes will have the same clinical signs. In the case that the identity of the trematode cannot be determined, the drug triclabendazole can be used since this will deal with all three parasites.|$|E
5000|$|Extensive cuniculture {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of keeping rabbits at a lower density and a lower production level than intensive culture. Specifically as relates to rabbits, this type of production was nearly universal prior to germ theory understanding of infectious parasites (especially coccidia) and the role of nutrition in prevention of abortion and reproductive loss. The most extensive rabbit [...] "keeping" [...] methods would be the harvest of wild or feral rabbits for meat or fur market, such as occurred in Australia prior to the 1990s. Warren-based cuniculture is somewhat more controlled, as the animals are generally kept to a specific area and a limited amount of supplemental feeding provided. Finally, various methods of raising rabbits with pasture as the primary food source have been developed. Pasturing rabbits within a fence (but not a cage) also known as colony husbandry, has not been commonly pursued due to the high death rate from weather and predators. More commonly (but still rare in terms of absolute numbers of rabbits and practitioners) is the practice of confining the rabbits to a moveable cage with an open or slatted floor so that the rabbits can access grass but still be kept at hand and protected from weather and predators. This method of growing rabbits does not typically result in an over-all reduction for the need for supplemented feed. The growing period to market weight is much longer for grass fed rather than pellet fed animals, and many producers continue to offer small amounts of complete rations {{over the course of the}} growing period. Hutches or cages for this type of husbandry are generally made of a combination of wood and metal wire, made portable enough for a person to move the rabbits daily to fresh ground, and of a size to hold a litter of 6 to 12 rabbits at the market weight of 4 to 5 pounds. Protection from sun and driving rain are important health concerns, as is durability against predator attacks and the ability to be cleaned to prevent loss from coccidious. Medical care and the use of <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> are less common.|$|E

In particular, the lipid vehicle was developed in order to deliver oxytetracycline hydrocloride to rainbow trout (RT) and European sea bass (ESB) so as to improve the drug’ s oral bioavailability. The developed formulation was assessed in comparison to an aqueous solution working with two fish species (one fresh-water and one salt-water), after oral administration with a gastric probe. Results indicated an enhancement of bioavailability of 5. 86 and 5. 41 times over the aqueous solution, in RT and ESB, respectively. SES was then used to prepare <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> containing the formulation. The pharmacokinetic of this feed was evaluated after oral administration and compared to that of commercial OTC <b>medicated</b> <b>feed.</b> The bioavailability of OTC delivered in SES was 3. 2 times higher in RT and 2. 7 times higher in ESB, than OTC supplied by commercial <b>medicated</b> <b>feed.</b> This bioavailability enhancement was confirmed when RT were fed by classical administration in fish tanks of single and repeated administration of OTC delivered in SES and commercial <b>medicated</b> <b>feed,</b> attesting to better absorption of the SES formulation...|$|E

40|$|The {{cross-contamination}} of non-medicated feed with residues of antimicrobials causes {{an animal}} {{and public health}} concern associated {{with the potential for}} the selection and dissemination of resistance in commensal bacteria and potentially zoonotic bacteria. To identify the extent of this situation, we built a risk model that provides a way to estimate the percentage of cross-contaminated feed in total and at the different levels at which cross-contamination may occur (i. e. the feed mill, the transport truck, the farm), for different levels of antimicrobial <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> produced in a country per year. The model, estimated that when antimicrobial <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> represents a hypothetical x(i) = 2 % of the total feed produced in a country per year, then 5. 5 % (95 % CI = 3. 4 %; 11. 4 %) of the total feed produced in a year could be cross-contaminated with different levels of antimicrobials due to practices related to <b>medicated</b> <b>feed.</b> In detail, 1. 80 % (95 % CI = 0. 2 %; 7. 7 %) of the total feed produced in such a country would be cross-contaminated due to antimicrobial carryover occurring at the feed mill level, 1. 83 % (95 % CI = 1. 3 %; 2. 0 %) at the transport truck level and 1. 84 % (95 % CI = 1. 2 %; 2. 0 %) at the farm level. The model also demonstrated that even in cases where antimicrobial <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> would be produced in end-of-line mixers or a fine dosing system on trucks, the risk of cross-contamination would not be negligible; the percentage of cross-contaminated feed produced in a country (where x(i) = 2 %) per year would be 3. 7 % (95 % CI = 2. 9 %; 4. 0 %) and 2. 4 % (95 % CI = 1. 6 %; 2. 7 %), respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT Frequently, {{publications}} {{pertaining to}} waterfowl state that <b>medicated</b> <b>feeds</b> {{should not be}} fed to ducklings and goslings. In some localities, producers and hobbyists who raise {{a small number of}} ducklings and goslings can purchase only medicated chick, turkey, or gamebird starter and grower feeds. Because of the lack of documented information on this subject and the numer-ous requests for advice on this matter, anticoccidial drugs, zoalene, sulfaquinoxaline, and ampro-lium, were mixed in mash feed and fed to Khaki Campbell male ducklings to 4 weeks of age. No significant differences in mean body weight, mortality, and anatomical development were observed among the treatments. Medicated commercial crumble turkey and chick starter feeds produced significantly better feed conversion than the mash <b>medicated</b> or nonmedicated <b>feeds.</b> These differences can be attributed to greater feed spillage with the mash feed. Some ducklings in all treatments showed unsteadiness of gait and shaky legs. These conditions disappeared when the ducklings were moved from the battery brooder to an outside pen.

40|$|A {{ranking system}} for {{veterinary}} medicinal products and <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> additives has been developed {{as a tool to}} be applied in a risk-based approach to the residue testing programme for foods of animal origin in the National Residue Control Plan. In the context of food sampling and residue testing for the National Residue Control Plan, there is firstly, the risk to human health from residues of chemical substances in food and secondly, the issue of non-compliance with regulations relating to residues in food due to improper farm practices; both these elements are included in the developed risk-ranking of substances. Three characteristics of substances that may occur as residues in food are included in the developed risk-ranking system: ‘Potency’, as measured by the acceptable daily intake value assigned to each substance; ‘Usage’, as measured by the three factors of number of doses, use on individual animals or for group treatment, and withdrawal period; ‘Residue Occurrence’, as measured by non-compliant samples in the National Residue Control Plan. The risk-ranking system for substances has been developed using a scoring system applied to the various parameters to give an overall score. It is a relatively simple system, designed to provide a basis for selecting the {{veterinary medicinal products}} and <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> additives that might be prioritised for residue testing. However, a number of limitations are associated with the system and this risk-ranking of substances represents only one component of a total risk-based approach to designing the residue testing programme.

Since erythromicin is normally given {{in the form of}} <b>medicated</b> <b>feed,</b> in this study 3 new types of feed formulation were developed. A self-emulsifying system and two types of double microemulsions (O/W/O) were prepared, characterised and adsorbed on a commercial extruded diet for fish. The emulsified systems were based on saturated polyglycolized glycerides and mono- and diglycerides of medium chain fatty acids (as oily phase), Tweenr 80 (as surfactant) and, in the case of double microemulsions, distilled water. The systems differed in percentage composition and for the amount and position of erythromycin in different phases. The three <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> were then administered orally by means of a gastric probe to rainbow trout and their relative bioavailability was estimated in comparison to that obtained after oral administration of feed with erythromycin powder.

However, small quantities of specialized feeds are often needed for experimental purposes, feeding difficult-to maintain aquarium fishes, larval or small juvenile fishes, brood fish conditioning, or administering medication to sick fish. Small ornamental fish farms with an assortment of fish require small amounts of various diets with particular ingredients. It is not cost effective for commercial manufacturers to produce very small quantities of specialized feeds.

40|$|Different {{compound}} feeds {{have to be}} manufactured in the same production line. As a consequence, traces of the first produced feed may remain in the production and get mixed with the next feed batches. This "carry-over" is unavoidable, and so non-medicated feed can be contaminated with veterinary drugs like antibiotics added to the previous batch of <b>medicated</b> <b>feed.</b> To monitor the carry-over of antibiotics in the Netherlands, 21 feed mills were visited and 140 samples of flushing feeds were collected and analysed for containing residues of antibiotics. Results show that 87 % of all samples contain concentrations of antibiotics {{in the range of}} 0. 1 - 154 mg/kg. It is expected that these levels - which are in the same range as previously found for the nowadays banned antimicrobial growth promoters (AMGPs) - {{have an effect on the}} occurrence of microbial resistance. Analysis of a second set of samples collected at four different feed mills directly after the production of oxytetracycline-medicated feed demonstrated that the first part of a flushing feed has much higher contamination than the last part of the batch.

Oxytetracycline residues were detectable, however, in egg albumen during the 5 th d of treatment and the 1 st d of <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> withdrawal. These concentrations were close to the limit of the assay's sensitivity (117 ppb). These data indicate that illegal or unintentional dosing of laying hens with feed medicated at the doses allowed for breeder hens or meat-type poultry should not produce consistently detectable levels of residues of OTC in eggs...|$|E
40|$|The {{bitterness}} of racemic praziquantel (PZQ) currently constrains its {{use as an}} infeed treatment against monogenean flukes in finfish aquaculture. In an effort to increase the palatability of diets containing racemic PZQ for yellowtail kingfish, the palatability and efficacy of 2 forms of racemic PZQ (powder or powder within microcapsules) against natural infestations of skin and gill flukes were compared using 2 different dietary application methods (incorporated within the pellet mash prior to extrusion or surface-coated after extrusion) at active dietary inclusion levels of 8, 16 and 25 g kg- 1 in large (3. 5 - 4 kg) yellowtail kingfish. There was no clear benefit of incorporating PZQ into diets prior to extrusion. PZQ microcapsules improved the palatability of PZQ-containing diets but did not completely mask the bitter flavour. At the lowest active dietary inclusion level of 8 g kg- 1, ingestion of the diet containing PZQ microcapsules was equal to the control and significantly better than that containing PZQ powder. At an inclusion level of 16 g kg- 1, ingestion of the PZQ microcapsule diet was significantly better than that containing the same inclusion of PZQ powder but {{significantly lower than the}} control. Consumption of the diet containing 25 g kg- 1 of PZQ microcapsules was poor. All fish consuming <b>medicated</b> <b>feeds</b> had a significant reduction in flukes relative to control fish; however, efficacy data and blood serum analysis suggested that diets containing PZQ microcapsules had lower bioavailability than those containing PZQ powder...|$|R

40|$|A liquid chromatographic tandem {{mass spectrometric}} method for the {{determination}} of sulfa drugs in beeswax was developed. When performing residue control on beeswax intended for the fabrication of wax foundations, residues of sulfonamides were found. A migration test {{was set up to}} study whether sulfonamide-containing beeswax could lead to the contamination of honey. The higher the concentration of sulfamethazine doped in the wax, the higher was the concentration of sulfamethazine found in the honey. The maximum transfer was 15. 6, 56. 9, and 29. 5 % of the initial amount spiked in the wax foundation. In a second experiment, the percentage of sulfamethazine migrating from <b>medicated</b> winter <b>feed</b> to beeswax in relation to the concentration in the syrup and the contact time was studied. The maximum transfer of sulfamethazine from medicated sucrose syrup to beeswax was 3. 1 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis summarises {{the experience with}} the use of selected anthelmintics against both mouflon muelleriosis and dicrocoeliosis. All experimental studies were carried out in the game enclosure of Vlkov, Czech Republic in 1996 - 2003. Anthelmintics were administered orally and the intensity of the infection was evaluated. Intra-vital diagnostics were carried out {{with the use of}} coprological methods (modified Breza method, modified Baermann method), post-mortem diagnostics on the basis of helminthological organ control (lungs, liver). A long-term effect of repeatedly administered anthelmintics on the actual parasitostatus of the mouflon population was monitored. Two benzimidazoles (flubendazole, albendazole) were tested; both anthelmintics adminitered in the form of <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> were found as high effective against muelleriosis, a lower effectivity was determined against dicrocoeliosis. Albendazole was highly effective against dicrocoeliosis after individual administration {{in the form of an}} oral suspension. Closantel in combination with flubendazole (<b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> was used only) reached a minimal effect against dicrocoeliosis. The total state of the studied parasitoses in the treated mouflon herd has an improving character namely in muelleriosis.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the current status {{on the use of}} probiotics, disinfectants and antimicrobials in hatcheries, nurseries and grow-out farms producing Pangasius catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 83 aquaculture enterprises (15 hatcheries, 32 nurseries and 36 grow-out farms). Farmers reported use of a total of 24 different antimicrobials, e. g. for treatment of bacillary necrosis and motile aeromonad septicaemia, and a variety of disinfectants, probiotics and nutritional supplements. In contrast to small-scale farmers, all large-scale grow-out farmers studied were certified and therefore had higher levels of formal education and specialized aquaculture training to diagnose and treat diseases. All farmers prepared their own <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> with a high risk of treatment failure, negative environmental impact from released antimicrobials and resistance development. Small-scale farmers were at particular occupational health risks when handling antimicrobials and other chemicals, e. g. mixing <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> with bare hands. There is an urgent need to improve knowledge and use innovative approaches, e. g. private-public partnerships, to assure a prudent use of chemicals, to improve capacity and access to disease diagnosis, particularly for small-scale grow-out farmers and nurseries. Efforts to control use of antimicrobials in aquaculture should be coordinated with the livestock and human health sectors taking an One-Health approach. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{low level}} intake of drugs {{resulting}} from the ingestion of contaminated feed may lead to residue problems in food animals. Sulfadimidine (SDD) {{was used as a}} model to determine the residue risk at various doses in laying hens. The drug was administered as a single intravenous injection (100 mg kg- 1 body weight, BW), as a single oral dose (100, 30, 10, 3, 1 mg kg - 1 BW) and via <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> for seven consecutive days (30, 10, 3 mg kg - 1 BW). Drug levels were determined with HPLC-UV for plasma, yolk and albumen. Pharmacokinetic values, which were calculated using a first-order one compartment model, residue levels and transfer rates into the eggs, were found to be dose-dependent. Even low doses at 3 and 1 mg kg - 1 BW resulted in measurable residues in yolk and albumen one day after a single oral administration. After ingestion of <b>medicated</b> <b>feed</b> at 3 mg kg - 1 BW mean drug levels at 0. 14 ± 0. 01 µg g- 1 were found in albumen and at 0. 09 ± 0. 01 µg ml- 1 in plasma. Generally, the residue levels in albumen and plasma were higher than in yolk. These findings demonstrate a residue risk for the consumer even after low level intake of drugs...|$|E
40|$|A {{randomized}} {{intervention study}} was conducted to determine if discontinuing use of calf milk replacer medicated with oxytetracycline results in increased tetracycline susceptibility in Salmonella and Campylobacter spp. and Escherichia coli in dairy calves over a 12 -month period. Dairy herds with enteric bacteria with known low tetracycline susceptibility were enrolled for the study. Fecal samples from preweaned calves and environmental samples were collected from eight dairy herds in Michigan and New York State. Samples were collected monthly for 3 months prior to and 12 months after four of the eight herds discontinued <b>medicated</b> milk replacer <b>feeding.</b> Salmonella and Campylobacter spp. and E. coli were isolated, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted using automated broth microdilution. A total of 804 intervention and 1, 026 control calf fecal samples and 122 intervention and 136 control environmental samples were collected for testing. No differences in owner-reported morbidity and mortality between treatment groups were seen. The intervention was significantly associated with increasing tetracycline susceptibility in E. coli and Salmonella. Tetracycline susceptibility increased in intervention herds for the first 3 months after switching to nonmedicated milk replacer but declined in subsequent months. Discontinuing the practice of <b>feeding</b> <b>medicated</b> milk replacers to calves increased tetracycline susceptibility in E. coli and Salmonella on dairy farms, without increasing cattle disease, but declines in effectiveness after 3 months suggest that other factors contribute to decreasing susceptibility on the farm...|$|R

Reduction in fecal shedding and prevention of new Salmonella infections in livestock during the late finishing/marketing phase of production are critical control points associated with human food safety. The objectives of this research were to compare the effects of various treatments on the shedding of Salmonella during the late finishing phase of production in littermate swine reared nnder different management conditions. The treatments compared were: 1) multi-site segregated early weaning (SEW) versus continuous flow (CF) rearing of swine, 2) growth promotant antibiotics (<b>medicated)</b> versus no <b>feed</b> antibiotics (unmedicated), 3) 24 hour fasting versus full- feeding...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the effects of a gluco-oligosaccharide (GOS), as an alternative to growth promoters in piglets, on: growth performance, blood parameters and morphological characteristics of the intestinal tract. Four week old weaned piglets (n= 128) (7. 2 ± 1. 04 kg l. w.) were divided into four groups and fed for 77 days on different diets as follows: 1. - Basal diet (CTR); 2. - Basal diet supplemented with a 2 % GOS; 3. - Basal diet supplemented with chlortetracycline and spiramicine at 1000 and 400 mg/ kg, respectively, for 14 days and then fed the CTR basal diet (CTRM); or 4. -a GOS diet supplemented and administered as in group 3 (GOSM). Animals were individually weighed 5 times, on days 0, 14, 35, 56 and 77. At the same time, the feed intake and average daily gains (ADG) were recorded and the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was calculated. On days 0 and 77, plasma was sampled from 6 piglets/treatment group, whereas on 77 th day, 4 piglets/treatment were slaughtered to assess the morphological characteristics of parts of their gastro-intestinal tracts (ileum and caecum). The results showed no effects of the medications on the ADG in all the experimental periods. However, from days 57 to 77 of the trial period, the ADG was found to be higher in the GOS-fed animals (P= 0. 0747). During the first 14 days of the trial, the piglets on the medicated diets showed a higher intake than the animals in the normal diet groups, but no differences were detectable in the FCR. The globulin concentration and the albumin/globulin ratio was found to be reduced by GOS treatment (P < 0. 01). The urea concentration in the blood was decreased (P< 0. 05), whereas the plasma concentration of phosphorous was increased (P< 0. 01), by GOS supplementation. We found that the heights of the villi in the ileum was higher in the piglets on the GOSM diet compared to CTRM diet: (188. 66 mm vs 255. 74 mm; P< 0. 01). We also observed that supplementing these diets with GOS lead to a higher caecum epithelial cell height (11. 7 μm vs 14. 7 μm; P 0. 068) compared with animals on the non-supplemented diets. Our current data indicate that the growth performance did not differ between piglets fed on control, antibiotic- supplemented or GOS-supplemented diets. A dietary supplementation of GOS does increase the villus length, but only in animals previously fed with <b>medicated</b> <b>feeds.</b> The use of GOS seems to exert anti-inflammatory effects upon these animals...|$|R
