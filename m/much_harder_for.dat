5|$|Royal {{government}} in England had traditionally centred on several great offices of state, filled by powerful, independent {{members of the}} baronage. Henry abandoned this policy, leaving the post of justiciar vacant and turning the position of chancellor into a more junior role. A small royal council was formed but its role was ill-defined; appointments, patronage, and policy were decided personally by Henry and his immediate advisers, rather than through the larger councils that had marked his early years. The changes made it <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> those outside Henry's inner circle to influence policy or to pursue legitimate grievances, particularly against the King's friends.|$|E

Climate zones also extend for thousands of miles, which facilitated the spread of agriculture, domestication of animals, and the diseases associated with domestication. The Americas extend mainly north and south, which, according to the environmental determinist theory popularized by Jared Diamond in Guns, Germs, and Steel, meant that it was <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> cultivated plant species, domesticated animals, and diseases to migrate.|$|E

25|$|Cabinet Committees {{will often}} discuss matters {{referred}} to them by Cabinet itself, and then report back {{the results of their}} deliberation. This can sometimes become a powerful tool for advancing certain policies, as was demonstrated in the Lange government. Roger Douglas, Minister of Finance, and his allies succeeded in dominating the finance committee, enabling them to determine what it recommended to Cabinet. The official recommendation of the finance committee was <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> his opponents to fight than his individual claims in Cabinet would be. Douglas was able to pass measures that, had Cabinet deliberated on them itself rather than pass them to Committee, would have been defeated.|$|E
25|$|Bolivia, {{like much}} of Latin America, is a highly class-segregated society, in this case along ethnic lines: European-Indio. European {{descendants}} tend to monopolize political and economic power {{and in fact the}} republican institutions are drawn along the lines of European schools of thought with little or no adjustment to the indigenous tradition. This makes it <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> the indigenous to integrate into society and to achieve personal success. Since the late 1990s, the indigenous communities have become radicalized throughout the Andes, pressing for political reform in Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia, loosely coordinated in the Pachacuti movement. The Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) is perhaps the strongest political expression of this movement in Bolivia, coordinating a wide range of community-based organizations mostly reflecting Aymara political aspirations.|$|E
25|$|Eyes are {{internal}} {{liberties of}} a group of stones that, like external liberties, prevent the group's capture, but unlike external liberties are <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> an opponent to fill due to the only way to kill a group with an eye is to fill all of its liberties before calling atari. The presence or absence of eyes in a group determine life or death of that group. A group with no eyes, or only one eye, will die unless its owner can develop them. Conversely, a group with two or more eyes will live. An opponent cannot capture such a group because it is impossible to remove all liberties of the group by playing one stone, without violating the suicide rule.|$|E

25|$|England {{was under}} the firmest control of all the lands in the Angevin Empire, due {{to the age of}} many of the offices that governed the country and the traditions and customs that were in place. England was divided in shires with sheriffs in each {{enforcing}} the common law. A justiciar was appointed by the king to stand in his absence {{when he was on the}} continent. As the kings of England were more often in France than England they used writs more frequently than the Anglo-Saxon kings, which actually proved beneficial to England. Under William I's rule, Anglo-Saxon nobles had been largely replaced by Anglo-Norman ones who couldn't own large expanses of contiguous lands, because their lands were split between England and France. This made it <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> them to revolt against the king and defend all of their lands at once. Earls held a status similar to that of the continental counts, but there were no dukes at this time, only ducal titles that the kings of England held.|$|E
500|$|Thio Li-ann {{has noted}} {{that it is not}} clear whether the Court of Appeal was laying down [...] "intentional and {{arbitrary}} discrimination" [...] as the sole test for whether executive acts comply with Article 12(1) of the Constitution, or whether it is only one possible test and that executive acts can also be challenged if they fail a reasonable classification test. This is because [...] "rbitrariness implies the lack of any rationality", and it is <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> a plaintiff to prove that executive action is irrational than to show that there is no reasonable classification in the action.|$|E
500|$|Influenced by his {{television}} and film scripting background, Martin {{tries to keep}} readers engrossed by ending each Ice and Fire chapter with a tense or revelational moment, a twist or a cliffhanger, similar to a TV act break. Scriptwriting has also taught him the technique of [...] "cutting out the fat and leaving the muscle", which is {{the final stage of}} completing a book, a technique that brought the page count in A Dance with Dragons down almost eighty pages. Dividing the continuous Ice and Fire story into books is <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> Martin. Each book shall represent a phase of the journey that ends in closure for most characters. A smaller portion of characters is left with clear-cut cliffhangers to make sure readers come back for the next installment, although A Dance with Dragons had more cliffhangers than Martin originally intended. Both one-time and regular POV characters are designed to have full character arcs ending in tragedy or triumph, and are written to hold the readers' interest and not be skipped in reading. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not rely on the hero to come through unscathed and will instead feel the character's fear with each page turn.|$|E

2500|$|Under {{the terms}} of {{resulting}} Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement, all duties imposed during {{the previous five years}} were lifted but Ireland was still entitled to impose tariffs on British imports to protect new Irish [...] "infant" [...] industries. Ireland was to pay a one-off £10 million sum to the United Kingdom (as opposed to annual repayments of £250,000 over 47 more years). Arguably the most significant outcome, however, was the return of so-called [...] "Treaty Ports", three ports in Ireland maintained by the UK as sovereign bases under {{the terms of}} the Anglo-Irish Treaty.

2500|$|Henry II didn't treat his territories as a {{coherent}} empire as the term [...] "Angevin Empire" [...] would suggest, but as private, individual possessions {{that he planned}} to distribute to his children. Henry, 'The Young King', was crowned King of England in 1170 (though he never ruled); Richard became Duke of Aquitaine in 1172; Geoffrey became Duke of Brittany in 1181; John became Lord of Ireland in 1185; Eleanor was promised to Alfonso VII with Gascony as dowry during the campaign against Toulouse in 1170.

2500|$|Attempts to link shell-hole {{positions}} failed, {{because they}} were visible from the air and British reconnaissance aircraft directed artillery onto them. Trenches were abandoned during an attack in preference for shell-holes further forward.

Back-lines and switch-trenches were dug as soon as manpower was available, on reverse slopes with artillery observation posts moved [...] further back. In early September the relief of the defenders of Ginchy by Bavarian Infantry Regiment 19 was rushed, giving the regiment no time to study the ground.

In recent years this aspect of the game seems to have passed its peak in England though it has by no means disappeared completely.

2500|$|Academics such as Diamond (2005) Wirthlin (2009) take {{exception}} {{to the role of}} [...] "hot lesbian" [...] in advertisements, and what has turned lesbianism into a commodity. As Diamond (2005) states, [...] "media representations signal a new appreciation and celebration of women's sexual freedom and diversity. On the other hand this is not necessarily the case...by portraying it as a fashionable 'add on' to otherwise conventional heterosexuality" [...] (p.105). They argue that women view these advertisements and images as a true reflection of {{what it is to be}} lesbian, thus making it <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> real lesbians to acknowledge their sexuality. Furthermore, Wirthlin (2009) points out that, [...] "In order to resist this we must first recognize the ubiquitous presence of [...] "fad" [...] lesbian images and then problematize their use in popular culture. Next, there needs to be an active resistance against these images through counterculture advertisements and the performative act of resistance, such as through the act of writing as oneself, by utilizing multiple voices and subjectivities" [...] (p.113). In both academics view, lesbian or bi-sexual women must be sure of what media means to them, and call into question things that do not appear [...] "authentic". Lesbians must also be educated on the topic of the [...] "hot lesbian", and ensure they do not fall into the [...] "heteronormative appropriation" [...] of advertising's effects.|$|E

50|$|Shock {{hardening}} is {{a process}} used to strengthen metals and alloys, wherein a shock wave produces atomic-scale defects in the material's crystalline structure. As in cold work, these defects interfere with the normal processes by which metallic materials yield (plasticity), making materials stiffer, but more brittle. When compared to traditional cold work, such an extremely rapid process results in a different class of defect, producing a <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> material <b>for</b> a given change in shape. If the shock wave applies too great a force for too long, however, the rarefaction front that follows it can form voids in the material due to hydrostatic tension, weakening the material and often causing it to spall. Since voids nucleate at large defects, such as oxide inclusions and grain boundaries, high-purity samples with a large grain size (especially single crystals) are able to withstand greater shock without spalling, and can therefore be made <b>much</b> <b>harder.</b>|$|R
