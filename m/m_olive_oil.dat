30|$|EEC Regulation 2568 / 91 [1] and International Olive Council (IOC) [2] have {{established}} both analytical and organoleptic criteria {{to define the}} quality grade of an <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> According {{to the results of}} chemical and sensory analyses, an <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> can be classified as extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (EVOO), virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> or lampante <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> Each category has a completely different commercial and nutritional value. Extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (EVOO) is a natural fruit juice with peculiar nutritional, healthy [3] and sensory [4] qualities as well as it represents a fundamental component of Mediterranean diet which is very rich in mono-unsaturated fatty acids [5] and polyphenols [6].
