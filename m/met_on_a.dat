5|$|All German {{officers}} {{were required to}} obtain official permission to marry; however, this was usually a bureaucratic formality. When Lent decided to marry Elizabeth Petersen, his admirer from Hamburg whom he had <b>met</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> blind date, his case was more complicated. 'Elisabeth Petersen' was in fact Helene (Lena) Senokosnikova, born in Moscow in April 1914. She had been afraid to reveal her true identity, since Russians were not popular in the Third Reich, but after a thorough investigation into her background and racial ancestry, she received her German citizenship on 15 March 1941. They were married on 10 September 1941 in Wellingsbüttel, Hamburg. The marriage produced two daughters. Christina was born on 6 June 1942; the second, Helma, was born on 6 October 1944, shortly after her father's fatal crash.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} Air Force, Barr {{remained}} in Mildura with his wife, Dorothy (Dot). They had <b>met</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> blind date in 1938 and been married {{only a few}} weeks when Nicky joined the RAAF. During the war she was told on three occasions that her husband was dead. The couple had two sons, born in 1945 and 1947. Barr's injuries prevented him from returning to a rugby career, and he took up yachting as a sport. He also briefly assisted fellow No.3 Squadron veteran Bobby Gibbes in an airline venture in New Guinea, before going into business as a company manager and director with civil engineering and pharmaceutical firms. Barr rejoined the RAAF on 20March 1951 as a pilot in the active Citizen Air Force (CAF), with the acting rank of wing commander. On 15April 1953, he transferred to the CAF reserve. A member of the Royal Air Forces Escaping Society, Barr began travelling to Italy with his wife on a regular basis in the late 1950s to seek out and offer assistance to those who had helped him during his wartime escape attempts.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, Australian {{universities}} faced unprecedented demand for international student places, which Monash <b>met</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> larger scale than most. Today, around 30% {{of its students}} are from outside Australia. Monash students come from over 100 different countries, and speak over 90 different languages. The increase in international students, combined with the university's expansion, meant that Monash's income greatly increased throughout the 1990s, {{and it is now}} one of Australia's top 200 exporters.|$|E

25|$|Berg {{was born}} as Shraga Feivel Gruberger in Brooklyn, to an Orthodox Jewish family. His first wife was named Rivkah {{with whom he}} had eight children. It was Rivka's uncle, Rabbi Yehuda Brandwein, dean of a Yeshiva named Kol Yehuda, whom Berg first <b>met</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> trip to Israel in 1962, and who would become his Kabbalistic mentor. There is some {{disagreement}} over who succeeded Rabbi Brandwein as dean of Yeshiva Kol Yehuda - Berg has claimed to have replaced Rabbi Brandwein in that role, but that claim is disputed by Brandwein's son Avraham, who is the current dean.|$|E

Later, back in their home town of Wolverhampton, the musicians met again and this time Holder agreed to join the group.

Lea, who also played the piano and guitar, had been in the Staffordshire Youth Orchestra and had gained first class honours in a London music-school practical exam.|$|E
25|$|A {{few years}} later, Speck's religious, {{teetotaler}} mother {{fell in love}} with a traveling insurance salesman from Texas, Carl August Rudolph Lindberg, whom she <b>met</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> train trip to Chicago. The hard-drinking, peg-legged Lindberg, with a 25-year criminal record that started with forgery and included several arrests for drunk driving, was the opposite of Speck's sober, hardworking father. Speck's mother married Lindberg on May 10, 1950 in Palo Pinto, Texas. Speck and his younger sister Carolyn stayed with their married sister Sara Thornton in Monmouth for a few months so Speck could finish second grade, before joining their mother and Lindberg in rural Santo, Texas, 40 miles west of Fort Worth, Texas, where Speck attended third grade.|$|E

Before he married Ingaret, he had become engaged to Fleur Kohler-Baker, {{the daughter of a}} prominent farmer and businessman, who was 17 years old; they had <b>met</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> ship and had had an intense but brief affair of love letters; she was shocked when he broke off the relationship. He went on a honeymoon with Ingaret to Switzerland, where his new wife introduced him to Carl Jung. Jung was to have probably a greater influence upon him than anybody else, and he later said that he had never met anyone of Jung's stature. He continued to work on a travel book about his Nyasaland adventures called Venture to the Interior, which became an immediate best-seller in the US and Europe on its publication in 1952.|$|E
25|$|Capello {{was born}} in San Canzian d'Isonzo near Gorizia, in {{north-eastern}} Italy, {{in what was then}} the Allied-occupied Zone A of the Julian March. His parents were Guerrino and Evelina Capello. Capello is a devout Catholic who prays twice a day. His father, a schoolteacher, played football, and his uncle Mario Tortul was also a football player; for Triestina, Padova, Sampdoria and the Italy national team during the 1960s. Capello has spent his entire adult life working in football. He has been married to his wife Laura, whom he first <b>met</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bus as a teenager, for over 40 years. He is represented by his son Pier Filippo, who acts as his agent. In January 2008, Italian police announced that they were launching an investigation into tax irregularities by Capello. The probe, however, has been dismissed as routine by Capello's spokesmen, who said this was part of a wider investigation into a number of wealthy Italians. The FA revealed that they had known about the upcoming probe when they had appointed Capello, and expected no charges to be brought.|$|E
25|$|Aldo Leopold is {{generally}} credited with first describing {{the mechanism of}} a trophic cascade, based on his observations of overgrazing of mountain slopes by deer after human extermination of wolves. Nelson Hairston, Frederick E. Smith and Lawrence B. Slobodkin are generally credited with introducing the concept into scientific discourse, although they {{did not use the}} term either. Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin argued that predators reduce the abundance of herbivores, allowing plants to flourish. This {{is often referred to as}} the green world hypothesis. The green world hypothesis is credited with bringing attention to the role of top-down forces (e.g. predation) and indirect effects in shaping ecological communities. The prevailing view of communities prior to Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin was trophodynamics, which attempted to explain the structure of communities using only bottom-up forces (e.g. resource limitation). Smith may have been inspired by the experiments of a Czech ecologist, Hrbáček, whom he <b>met</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> United States State Department cultural exchange. Hrbáček had shown that fish in artificial ponds reduced the abundance of zooplankton, leading to an increase in the abundance of phytoplankton.|$|E
