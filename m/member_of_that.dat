5|$|A group {{consists}} {{of a set of}} elements and a single operation which combines a first and a second element and returns a third. The operation must satisfy certain constraints for it to determine a group: It must be closed (when applied to any pair of elements of the associated set, the generated element must also be a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> set), it must be associative, there must be an identity element (an element which, when combined with another element using the operation, results in the original element, such as adding zero to a number or multiplying it by one), and for every element there must be an inverse element.|$|E

5|$|Alsace {{in general}} is a stronghold of the French right. The main French right-wing party, The Republicans, {{currently}} holds a large majority in the council (26 councillors).

Voters in Sélestat generally favour right-wing candidates at other elections as well, although Sélestat was governed by the Socialist Party between 1989 and 2001.|$|E

5|$|The {{record is}} {{primarily}} based on DeLonge's post-hardcore influences, such as Fugazi and Refused. The recording sessions were particularly difficult for him, {{as he had}} recently undergone back surgery. The record is a concept album detailing {{the end of the}} world, and features dark, moody tracks mulling over confusion. Blink-182 bassist Mark Hoppus—the only <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> band not involved in the project—felt betrayed over his lack of inclusion, which evolved into tensions between him and DeLonge. It contributed to the band's 2005 breakup.|$|E
5|$|These were no easy years, again, {{as former}} Afrikaner compatriots {{found each other}} on {{two sides of the}} {{political}} fence, in a rapidly changing world. As in his earlier life, Reitz remained a man of outspoken convictions, which he aired freely. As such, he came into conflict with the Smuts government, and in 1920 he was not re-appointed as president of the Senate. He did remain a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> House until 1929, however.|$|E

The Whig Party had {{practically}} dissolved by this time, {{and he joined}} many of his fellow Kentuckians in associating with the Know Nothing Party. Although he {{did not agree with}} all of the party's principles, he would not associate with the Democrats, the party he had spent much of his career denouncing, nor would he associate with the new Republican Party because of their stance against slavery. Despite his misgivings about some of the party platform, he campaigned on behalf of Millard Fillmore, the party's candidate in the 1856 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|After {{examining}} the holotype in London, Hershkovitz instead placed the {{species in the}} genus Oryzomys in 1948. He remarked {{that it was an}} especially distinctive <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> genus, and hence classified it in its own subgenus Micronectomys. J. Hernández-Camacho described a second species of Micronectomys, Oryzomys (Micronectomys) borreroi, from Colombia in 1957. In 1970, Hershkovitz treated O.dimidiatus in another publication and conceded that his name Micronectomys was a nomen nudum ("naked name") because he had not explicitly mentioned characters differentiating it from other taxa in his 1948 publication. Nevertheless, he did not do anything to rectify the situation, and Micronectomys remains a nomen nudum. Hershkovitz also noted that while O.dimidiatus resembles a juvenile Nectomys in external anatomy, it is otherwise similar to the marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris). He accepted O.borreroi as an Oryzomys, but did not think it closely related to O.dimidiatus. Six years later, Alfred Gardner and James Patton instead suggested that O.borreroi was a Zygodontomys, and in his 1991 review of that genus Robert Voss confirmed that it is the same as Zygodontomys brunneus.|$|E
5|$|Former University of Belize athlete Tricia Flores participated {{on behalf}} of Belize at the Beijing Olympics as a long jumper. She was the only female to compete as a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> year's Belizean delegation. Flores' {{participation}} at the Beijing Olympics marked her first appearance at any Olympic Games. Flores participated in the first qualifying heat on 18 August, where she competed against 21 athletes that included Brazil's Maurren Higa Magi, the United States' Grace Upshaw, and Sweden's Carolina Klüft. Flores ranked 19th in the heat, finishing last ahead of Slovakia's Jana Veldakova and Ukraine's Liudmyla Blonska, whose scores were not ranked. Overall, 42 athletes competed in women's long jump qualifiers and 38 completed the event. Flores ranked 38th and did not advance to semifinals, having jumped 5.25meters.|$|E
5|$|Gilligan {{was born}} in Denmark Hill, an area of Camberwell in London. He was the second of three sons, all of whom played {{first-class}} cricket, to Willie Austin Gilligan and Alice Eliza Kimpton. The family had a strong connection with Sussex; Gilligan followed Sussex County Cricket Club as a child, and later played club cricket there. After attending Fairfield School, he was educated at Dulwich College from 1906 until 1914 where he established a sporting reputation in athletics and cricket. In the latter sport, {{he played in the}} school first eleven, as did his brothers; in 1913, all three boys played in the team. Gilligan played in the eleven between 1911 and 1914 and captained the side in his final two years. In 1914, he came top of the school batting and bowling averages. Selected to play representative schools cricket at Lord's Cricket Ground in 1914, he took ten wickets in total and scored one fifty in the two matches. By the standards of school cricket, his pace was impressive, and Surrey invited him to play for their second eleven during the school holidays of 1913 and 1914; his father was a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> county's committee, and Gilligan qualified to play through his London birth.|$|E

Most recently they include Iain Balshaw and Kyran Bracken, who both played for England when they won the 2003 Rugby World Cup, whilst another <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> team, Will Greenwood, went to Stonyhurst Saint Mary's Hall, where his mother taught maths until 2007. Current pupils of the school have won places to represent Spain, Mexico (under 19s) the Irish Exiles and the Welsh Exiles (under 19s). Old boys have also played at varsity level and have won blues for Oxford or Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|The unranked group Isostylis, {{with its}} one species, was {{reclassified}} as a {{section in the}} 1856 arrangement of Carl Meissner, and 1870 arrangement of George Bentham. In his 1981 revision of the genus, Alex George reclassified {{the group as a}} subgenus—Banksia subg. Isostylis—defined by the dome-shaped flower heads, with B.ilicifolia joined by newly described species B.cuneata and later B.oligantha. Banksia ilicifolia is the only common <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> subgenus; the two other species are rare and threatened, and are protected under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Relationships between B.ilicifolia and the other members of B.subg. Isostylis still remain unclear. Although DNA studies found B.cuneata to be the most basal of the three species, a 2004 study of genetic divergence within the subgenus yielded both other possibilities: some analyses suggested B.ilicifolia as basal, while others suggested B.oligantha. Biogeographical factors suggest that B.ilicifolia would be the most basal of the three species: it occurs in the High Rainfall Zone where relictual species are most common, whereas the others are restricted to the Transitional Rainfall Zone, where more recently evolved species are most common.|$|E
5|$|Under Kentucky's first {{constitution}} (1792), the Speaker of the Kentucky Senate became acting governor {{upon the}} death, resignation, or {{removal of the}} sitting governor from office, until a new election could be held. The 1799 constitution created the office of lieutenant governor, who acted as Speaker of the Senate, but was not otherwise considered a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> body. The lieutenant governor was to become governor {{in the event of}} the sitting governor's death, resignation, or removal from office and was to act in a gubernatorial capacity any time the governor was out of the state. Whenever the lieutenant governor became acting governor, the Senate was to elect one of its members to act as Speaker; that individual then became next in the line of gubernatorial succession. A provision of the 1850 constitution added that, if the governor's term had more than two years remaining {{at the time of his}} death, resignation, or removal from office, a special election would be called to fill the office; the lieutenant governor would be acting governor in the interim.|$|E
