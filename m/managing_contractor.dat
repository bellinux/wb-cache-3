40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Energy (DOE) has been investigating Yucca Mountain, Nevada, as a possible repository for highly radioactive nuclear waste.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry has higher accident rates than normal manufacturing. Very high accident rates were found amongst contractors {{in parts of}} the Norwegian offshore industry. The term contractor includes individual workers, small firms, and large construction companies with many employees. The contractor is exposed to process risks and diverse occupational risks while doing maintenance or construction work. Clients have legal obligations to inspect contractors ' safety performance. They are also accountable for contractors ' accidents. A certain model used in the Norwegian offshore industry for <b>managing</b> <b>contractor</b> safety, the integration model, was developed from quality management principles. Contractors are hired for short-term and long-term construction projects, and during this time their safety programs are reviewed and adapted to the programs of clients.

40|$|Purpose: To provide {{recommendations}} for construction clients who design and implement financial incentive mechanisms (FIMs) on projects. [...] Methodology: Four large Australian building projects commissioned by government clients under <b>managing</b> <b>contractor</b> contracts and completed between 2001 and 2005 were examined {{to explore the}} ‘drivers’ that promoted motivation toward financial incentive goals. The results were triangulated across data sources, projects and stakeholder types. [...] Findings: FIM design should incorporate: 1. 	flexibility to modify goals and measurement procedures over time, 2. 	multiple goals covering different project areas, 3. 	distribution of rewards across all the key organizations contributing to team performance (e. g. potentially not just the contractor, but the subcontractors and consultants) and a reward amount sufficient to be valued by potential recipients. FIM benefits are maximized through the following complementary procurement initiatives: 4. 	equitable contract risk allocation, 5. 	early contractor involvement in design, 6. 	value-driven tender selection, 7. 	relationship workshops, and 8. 	future work opportunities. [...] Research Limitations: This paper provides practical recommendations to industry and hence does not emphasize theoretical aspects. [...] Practical Implications: The uptake of these recommendations {{is likely to increase}} the impact of FIMs on motivation and improve project and industry outcomes. Although the study focuses on government clients of building projects, all the recommendations would seem to apply equally to private-sector clients and to non-building projects.

40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} This {{research}} aims {{to examine the effects}} of inadequate documentation to the cost management & tendering processes in <b>Managing</b> <b>Contractor</b> Contracts using Fixed Lump Sum as a benchmark. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was conducted with industry practitioners to solicit their views on documentation quality issues associated with the construction industry. This is followed by a series of semi-structured interviews with a purpose of validating survey findings. Findings and value The results showed that documentation quality remains a significant issue, contributing to the industries inefficiency and poor reputation. The level of satisfaction for individual attributes of documentation quality varies. Attributes that do appear to be affected by the choice of procurement method include coordination, build ability, efficiency, completeness and delivery time. Similarly the use and effectiveness of risk mitigation techniques appears to vary between the methods, based on a number of factors such as documentation completeness, early involvement, fast tracking etc. Originality/value of paper This research fills the gap of existing body of knowledge in terms of limited studies on the choice of a project procurement system has an influence on the documentation quality and the level of impact. Conclusions Ultimately research concludes that the entire project team including the client and designers should carefully consider the individual projects requirements and compare those to the trade-offs associated with documentation quality and the procurement method. While documentation quality is definitely an issue to be improved upon, by identifying the projects performance requirements a procurement method can be chosen to maximise the likelihood that those requirements will be met. This allows the aspects of documentation quality considered most important to the individual project to be managed appropriately...|$|E

40|$|After {{a tumultuous}} year {{discovering}} serious lapses in environment, {{safety and health}} management at Brookhaven National Laboratory, the Department of Energy established a new management contract. It called for implementation of an IS 0 14001 Environmental Management System and registration of key facilities. Brookhaven Science Associates, the <b>managing</b> <b>contractor</b> for the Laboratory, designed and developed a three-year project to change culture and achieve {{the goals of the}} contract. The focus of its efforts were to use IS 0 14001 to integrate environmental stewardship into all facets of the Laboratory's mission, and manage its programs in a manner that protected the ecosystem and public health. A large multidisciplinary National Laboratory with over 3, 000 employees and 4, 000 visiting scientists annually posed significant challenges for IS 0 14001 implementation. Activities with environmental impacts varied from regulated industrial waste generation, to soil activation from particle accelerator operations, to radioactive groundwater contamination from research reactors. A project management approach was taken to ensure project completion on schedule and within budget. The major work units for the Environmental Management System Project were as follows: Institutional EMS Program Requirements, Communications, Training, Laboratory-wide Implementation, and Program Assessments. To minimize costs and incorporate lessons learned before full-scale deployment throughout the Laboratory, a pilot process was employed at three facilities. Brookhaven National Laboratory has completed its second year of the project in the summer of 2000, successfully registering nine facilities and self-declaring conformance in all remaining facilities. Project controls, including tracking and reporting progress against a model, have been critical to the successful implementation. Costs summaries are lower than initial estimates, but as expected legal requirements, training, and assessments are key cost centers. Successes to date include the pilot process, heightened employee awareness, registration of the first DOE National Laboratory facility, line ownership of the program, and senior management commitment...|$|E

40|$|In 1988, {{groundwater}} {{contaminated with}} trichloroethene (TCE) and technetium- 99 (Tc- 99) was identified in samples collected from residential water wells withdrawing groundwater from the Regional Gravel Aquifer (RGA) {{north of the}} Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) facility. In response, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) provided temporary drinking water supplies to approximately 100 potentially affected residents by initially supplying bottled water, water tanks, and water-treatment systems, and then by extending municipal water lines, all at no cost, to those persons whose wells could be affected by contaminated groundwater. The Water Policy boundary was established in 1993. In the Policy, DOE agreed to pay the reasonable monthly cost of water for homes and businesses and, in exchange, many of the land owners signed license agreements committing to cease using the groundwater via rural water wells. In 2012, DOE requested that Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU), <b>managing</b> <b>contractor</b> of Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), provide an independent assessment of {{the quality and quantity}} of the existing groundwater monitoring data and determine if there is sufficient information to support a modification to the boundary of the current Water Policy. As a result of the assessment, ORAU concludes that sufficient groundwater monitoring data exists to determine that a shrinkage and/or shift of the plume(s) responsible for the initial development of this policy has occurred. Specifically, there is compelling evidence that the TCE plume is undergoing shrinkage due to natural attenuation and associated degradation. The plume shrinkage (and migration) has also been augmented in local areas where large volumes of groundwater were recovered by pump-and treat remedial systems along the eastern and western boundaries of the Northwest Plume, and in other areas where pump-and-treat systems have been deployed by DOE to remove source contaminants. The available evidence supports adjusting the western and northwestern Water Policy boundary. Based on the historical and modeled hydrogeological data reflecting past flow and plume attenuation, along with associated plume migration toward the northeast, the establishment of a new boundary along the westernmost margin of the earliest indication of the TCE plume is proposed and justified on hydrogeological grounds. Approximately 30 % of the original area would remain within the adjusted Water Policy area west and northwest of the PGDP facility. This modification would release about 70 % of the area, although individual properties would overlap the new boundary...|$|E

40|$|This study {{engages with}} the debates on {{industrial}} relations and economic {{performance at the}} micro-level. Primarily; this issue has been addressed through the production function approach which seeks to correlate a variable for unionisation with an economic performance measure. Criticisms are put forward which stress the technical limitations of existing studies, the limitations of statistical studies in examining social processes, and theoretical problems with the production function approach. The literature recognises {{the need for a}} detailed, processual case study. The thesis is such a case study, examining the Engineering Construction Industry, i. e. the building of large power stations and process plants, from 1960 to 1990. The principal research methods were archive work and interviewing. The industry was chosen because it constituted a 'crucial' case for the argument that labour militancy underlay the UK's poor economic performance in the 1960 s and 1970 s. The industry was characterised by widespread militancy and large project overruns, the assumption (tested within the thesis) being that the former caused the latter. The key finding is that the chronic project delays were at root due to the opportunistic practices of contractors who deliberately and covertly delayed construction in order to force the client into offering extra payments. A key profit focus of contractors lay in exploiting opportunities to generate additional payments. The widespread militancy of the 1960 s and 1970 s exacerbated overruns, but the key significance of militancy was that it was used as a tool by contractors in reproducing beneficial commercial relations with clients. The improvement in performance in the 1980 s was at root due to the rise of <b>managing</b> <b>contractors</b> who curbed opportunism. Unconstrained by high levels of labour militancy, <b>managing</b> <b>contractors</b> adopted a low trust route to improve project performance, implying that the basis for longer term development has not been laid. A 'crucial' case study of the British worker argument has rejected the thesis that militancy underlay poor performance. The relationship between opportunism, militancy and poor performance uncovered within the study potentially has relevance for other important sectors of the UK economy...|$|R
