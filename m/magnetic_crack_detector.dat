40|$|Abstract. The {{dynamics}} and diagnostics of a cracked rotor have been gaining importance in recent years. The {{early detection of}} faults like fatigue cracks in rotor shafts {{are very important to}} prevent catastrophic failure of the rotor system. Vibration monitoring during start up or shut-down is as important as during steady state operation to detect cracks especially for machines such as aircraft engines which start and stop quite frequently and run at high speeds. So, the transient data of the cracked rotor has been transformed using the wavelet transforms for crack detection. Most of the works quoted in the literature used 1 D wavelets or 2 D wavelets (Continuous Wavelet Transform-CWT) for crack detection. The <b>crack</b> <b>detectors</b> in the signals are both time as well as frequency dependent. So, the use of 2 D wavelets is also not enough to detect the crack. In the present work a 3 D wavelet (CWT) has been utilized which clearly indicates both the time and frequency features of the crack. The presence of sub-criticals in the CWT may be a best crack indicator but it is not always reliable. The addition of noise to the signal may sometimes lead to inaccurate results.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this program is to develop sensors that allow condition based monitoring of critical combustion parts of gas turbines. Siemens teamed with innovative, small companies that were developing sensor concepts that could monitor wearing and cracking of hot turbine parts. A <b>magnetic</b> <b>crack</b> monitoring sensor concept developed by JENTEK Sensors, Inc. was evaluated in laboratory tests. Designs for engine application were evaluated. The inability to develop a robust lead wire to transmit the signal long distances resulted in a discontinuation of this concept. An optical wear sensor concept proposed by K Sciences GP, LLC was tested in proof-of concept testing. The sensor concept depended, however, on optical fiber tips wearing with the loaded part. The fiber tip wear resulted in too much optical input variability; the sensor could not provide adequate stability for measurement. Siemens developed an alternative optical wear sensor approach that used a commercial PHILTEC, Inc. optical gap sensor with an optical spacer to remove fibers from the wearing surface. The gap sensor measured {{the length of the}} wearing spacer to follow loaded part wear. This optical wear sensor was developed to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 5. It was validated in lab tests and installed on a floating transition seal in an F-Class gas turbine. Laboratory tests indicate that the concept can measure wear on loaded parts at temperatures up to 800 {degrees}C with uncertainty of < 0. 3 mm. Testing in an F-Class engine installation showed that the optical spacer wore with the wearing part.

Applying the Fourier transform technique, the boundary-value problem is reduced to solving three coupling singular integral equations. Field intensity factors of stress, electric displacement, <b>magnetic</b> induction and <b>crack</b> opening displacement (COD) are further determined by the Lobatto-Chebyshev collocation method.

40|$|The {{useful life}} of {{mechanical}} components which experience highly stressed rolling/sliding contacts, such as rolling element bearings or gears, {{is limited by}} rolling contact fatigue (RCF). Surface initiated pitting is a mode of RCF which has in recent years received particular attention from industry due to its frequent occurrence in service. This work focuses on the growth behaviour of RCF cracks before they develop into surface pits. A three-contact disc machine was used to perform pitting experiments on bearing steel samples. Preliminary tests showed that surface initiated cracks could be reproduced under high contact pressure and mixed lubrication regime. However, {{it was not possible}} to detect them using the vibration monitoring system installed on the test rig. This led to the development of a high sensitivity crack detection system which employs the principle of magnetic flux leakage (MFL). The existing test rig was modified to accommodate an inductive sensor and required signal acquisition electronics. In addition, a signal processing procedure was developed to enable analysis in real time. It was shown that the MFL technique is significantly more sensitive than commonly used alternatives. The system is capable of automatically finding cracks down to about 100 ??m in length. In addition, results have shown a linear relationship between defect size and signal amplitude which enables in-situ sizing of cracks. Using the <b>crack</b> <b>detector,</b> a procedure to generate cracks and extract their growth rates was established. Crack growth was first studied under high contact pressure. It was found that initiation occurred very early in total life, which was attributed to high asperity stresses due to mixed lubrication regime. Total life to pitting was dominated by crack propagation, the speed of which was shown to depend on crack size. Small cracks grew at a steady and slightly decreasing rate until a critical size is reached at which propagation speed rapidly increases, shortly followed by pitting. Further study at lower loads confirmed that contact pressure is the main parameter controlling propagation speed. In order to identify a suitable crack propagation law, the measured crack growth rates were plotted against a stress intensity parameter expressed in terms of maximum contact pressure and crack size. The results suggest that after reaching certain length, rolling contact fatigue cracks grow according to a Paris??? type power law, where the exponent of stress intensity parameter, and therefore contact pressure, was found to be approximately 7. 5.

The collected results can serve as the basic information of eggshell quality research. Developing an automatic eggshell cracks inspecting system. Besides, figuring out a non-contact automatic eggshell crack inspecting system is a special objective in the future. An experiment system was built to measure the impulsive response signal and connected to two detectors, an accelerometer and a TCS (thickness and crack sensor). The received signals were then analyzed using the spectrum circuit, and the data were recorded. The response time of the impulse on the non-cracked areas was less than 0. 66 ms, and {{on or near the}} cracked areas was above 0. 82 ms. Thus, the TCS was chosen and used in the commercial system. 400 million eggs detected for making preserved eggs, an accuracy of 97 % required by the producer for this local made machine was satisfied as well. Improving the eggshell quality detector under the automatic eggshell cracks inspecting system to decrease the damage and inaccuracy of the surface eggshell. Integrating previous researching result, complete the eggshell detector and develop the facilities of “eggshell crack inspecting system. ” And the electronic design of eggshell <b>crack</b> <b>detector</b> has been developed. The automatic inspecting system represents the first device for both hen and duck eggs. A non-contact eggshell crack spectrum analysis is developed with Laser Doppler Vibrometer. The experiment shows complete eggshells have two main resonant frequencies in the spectrum analysis. Cracked eggshells have three main resonant frequencies in the spectrum analysis. In this way, no matter the frequency range of Laser Doppler Vibrometer measurement is between 0 - 10 k Hz, 0 - 5 k Hz, or 0 - 1 k Hz, the scan measurement for cracked eggshells can be judged as long as the third resonant frequency is found and the single measurement far the cracked eggshells can be judged as long as the third resonant frequency is found. Therefore, Laser Doppler Vibrometer measurement is a new breakthrough for eggshell crack measurement.

40|$|This report {{describes}} progress, experiments, {{and results}} {{for a project}} to develop a pipeline inline inspection tool that uses electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) to detect and grade stress corrosion cracking (SCC). There is a brief introduction that gives background material about EMATs and relevant previous Tuboscope work toward a tool. This work left various choices about the modes and transducers for this project. The experimental section then describes the lab systems, improvements to these systems, and setups and techniques to narrow the choices. Improvements, which involved transducer matching networks, better magnetic biasing, and lower noise electronics, led to improved signal to noise (SNR) levels. The setups permitted transducer characterizations and interaction measurements in plates with man-made cracks, pipeline sections with SCC, and a full pipe with SCC. The latter were done with a moveable and compact EMAT setup, called a lab mouse, which is detailed. Next, the results section justifies the mode and transducer choices. These were for magnetostrictive EMATs {{and the use of}} EMAT launched modes: SH 0 (at 2. 1 MHz-mm) and SV 1 (at 3. 9 MHz-mm). This section then gives details of measurements on these modes.

There are some variant to IMS such as Ion trap mobility spectrometry (ITMS) or Non-linear dependence on ion mobility (NLDM) {{which are based on}} IMS principle. The sensitivity of devices using this technology is limited to pg levels. The technology also requires the ionization of sample explosives which is accomplished by a radioactive source such as nickel-63 or americium-241. This technology is found in most commercially available explosive detectors such as the GE VaporTracer, Smith Sabre 4000 and Russian built MO-2M and MO-8. The presence of radioactive materials in these equipments cause regulatory hassles and requires special permissions at customs ports. These detectors cannot be field serviced and may pose radiation hazard to the operator if the casing of the <b>detector</b> <b>cracks</b> due to mishandling. Bi-yearly checks are mandatory on such equipment in most countries by regulating agencies to ensure that there are no radiation leaks. Disposal of these equipments is also controlled owing to the high half-life of the radioactive material used.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{magnetic}} field distribution around a crack {{can be calculated}} more easily and quickly by using a dipole model than finite element method (FEM). This paper reports the development of numerical analysis software that uses an improved dipole model to analyze the <b>magnetic</b> field around <b>cracks.</b> The preprocessor in this software includes the crack formation software, which can distribute the magnetic charge per unit area, m, on the crack section area. Also the lift-off, measurement area and sensor interval, and magnetization direction can {{be considered in the}} preprocessor. Also, the postprocessor presents functions, such as the natural {{magnetic field}} distribution and ∂B/∂x, ∂B/∂y, as results. Also, the physical characteristics of the magnetic optical sensor and the Hall sensor are included in the postprocessor, and the magnetic field distribution can be changed to optical intensity and electrical signal distribution. The experiment results, which are obtained by using the magnetic camera on the crack, are compared with analysis results obtained by using the dipole model analysis software...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDynamic {{analysis}} of two collinear electro-magnetically dielectric cracks in a piezoelectromagnetic material is made under in-plane magneto-electro-mechanical impacts. Generalized semi-permeable crack-face boundary conditions are proposed to simulate realistic opening cracks with dielectric. Ideal boundary conditions {{of a combination}} of electrically permeable or impermeable and magnetically permeable or impermeable assumptions are several limiting cases of the semi-permeable dielectric crack. Utilizing the Laplace and Fourier transforms, the mixed initial-boundary-value problem is reduced to solving singular integral equations with Cauchy kernel. Dynamic intensity factors of stress, electric displacement, <b>magnetic</b> induction and <b>crack</b> opening displacement (COD) near the inner and outer crack tips are determined in the Laplace transform domain. Numerical results for a special magnetoelectroelastic solid are calculated to show the influences of the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability inside the cracks on the crack-face electric displacement and magnetic induction. By means of a numerical inversion of the Laplace transform, the variations of the normalized intensity factors of stress and COD are discussed against applied magnetoelectric impact loadings and the geometry of the cracks for fully impermeable, vacuum, fully permeable cracks and shown in graphics...|$|R
