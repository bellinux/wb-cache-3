5|$|Never before have I {{written to}} {{a player to}} express my regret at his {{omission}} from the Australian XI.

5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very <b>much,</b> <b>my</b> darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

500|$|Poulenc, {{a highly}} {{accomplished}} pianist, usually composed {{at the piano}} and wrote many pieces for the instrument throughout his career. In Henri Hell's view, Poulenc's piano writing {{can be divided into}} the percussive and the gentler style reminiscent of the harpsichord. Hell considers that the finest of Poulenc's music for piano is in the accompaniments to the songs, a view shared by Poulenc himself. The vast majority of the piano works are, {{in the view of the}} writer Keith W Daniel, [...] "what might be called 'miniatures'". Looking back at his piano music in the 1950s, the composer viewed it critically: [...] "I tolerate the Mouvements perpétuels, my old Suite en ut , and the Trois pieces. I like very <b>much</b> <b>my</b> two collections of Improvisations, an Intermezzo in A flat, and certain Nocturnes. I condemn Napoli and the Soirées de Nazelles without reprieve." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} for Rowland’s segment in the iheartradio concert series, {{it was revealed that}} [...] "Rose Colored Glasses" [...] had made Rowland cry. [...] She said “the first time I heard the song it made me think of all of the relationships where I had to wear rose colored glasses,” in particular noting her past “toxic relationships” and “situations where I needed to leave” as the causes of her Rowland’s tears. Later it was revealed that the song had made Rowland’s vocals swell. During {{an interview}} for The Belfast Telegraph, Rowland spoke of the songs she had recorded for her third studio album. When speaking of [...] "Rose Colored Glasses", she said that it had taken its toll on her, “It brought back a few memories, and when I recorded it I cried so <b>much</b> <b>my</b> vocal chords got swollen." [...] She also expressed her pleasure at being able to sing about her experiences.|$|E

2500|$|McCartney {{was living}} in Jane Asher's parents' house when he found the {{inspiration}} for the song: [...] "I was laying in bed in the Ashers' garret... I was thinking of it as a song for Ringo, which it eventually turned out to be, so I wrote it as not too rangey in the vocal, then started making a story, sort of an ancient mariner, telling the young kids where he'd lived. It was pretty <b>much</b> <b>my</b> song as I recall... I think John helped out. The lyrics got more and more obscure as it goes on, but the chorus, melody and verses are mine." [...] The song began as being about different coloured submarines, but evolved to include only a yellow one.|$|E

2500|$|Gleeson {{also played}} senior {{football}} at 16, only {{for his life}} to change inexorably two years later when his back was crushed by a hydraulic door at a Warrnambool abattoir. He subsequently spent six weeks in hospital. Gleeson said of that time, [...] "I spent six weeks in hospital staring at the ceiling. That was pretty <b>much</b> <b>my</b> sporting career done. Sport was {{a huge part of}} my life and that was probably the hardest thing I've ever gone through." [...] That accident was the coaching catalyst for Gleeson. In 1990 at just 22, Gleeson became the coach of the Warrnambool Mermaids in the Country Victorian Invitational Basketball League (CVIBL). In his first season as coach, he guided the Mermaids to the championship. In 1992, he was appointed Head Coach of the Warrnambool Seahawks, a position he held for two years. In 1993, he earned the role of Head Coach of the Victorian Basketball All Star Team.|$|E
2500|$|After Australia's biggest {{defeat at}} home in 50 years the Australian press were in uproar and the {{selectors}} Ewart Macmillan, Jack Ryder and Don Bradman took drastic action, dropping the captain Brian Booth, batsman Bob Cowper and the bowlers Garth McKenzie, Peter Philpott and David Sincock. Booth {{received a letter from}} Bradman on behalf of the selectors explaining [...] "Never before have I written to a player to express my regret at his omission from the Australian XI. In your case I am making an exception because I want you to know how <b>much</b> <b>my</b> colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and {{will be the first to}} admit that your form has not been good." [...] Booth had made only 84 runs (16.80) in the series and never played for Australia again. Cowper was blamed for slow scoring even though he had made 99 and 60 in the Second and Third Tests. Peter Allan of Queensland was brought back into the side after he had taken the third best bowling figures in Australia – 10/61 in the first innings against Victoria, but was injured and McKenzie was restored to the team. The off-spinner Tom Veivers and young batsmen Ian Chappell were called up and Keith Stackpole made his Test debut, so Australia went to Adelaide with only three specialist bowlers – McKenzie, Hawke and Veivers. England simply kept the same XI from Sydney, even though this meant that Geoff Boycott was their third place bowler after Jeff Jones and Dave Brown. Mike Smith won the toss and decided to bat.|$|E
2500|$|Ester Dean and Dr. Luke {{also worked}} on the album, {{respectively}} writing and producing the other US lead single [...] "Rose Colored Glasses". The song's lyrics portray [...] "the issues that arise when one plays the fool in a relationship." [...] During Rowland's concert series for iheartradio, the singer took time out {{to reflect on the}} song. She recalled, [...] "The first time I heard the song it made me think of all of the relationships where I had to wear rose-colored glasses." [...] It was also revealed that, during the studio recording session with Dean, she began to cry at the thought of all the [...] "toxic relationships" [...] she had been in [...] "where she needed to leave." [...] Later in an interview with The Belfast Telegraph, Rowland said that the song had taken its toll on her. She said [...] "It brought back a few memories, and when I recorded it I cried so <b>much</b> <b>my</b> vocal chords got swollen." [...] Dean also worked alongside Rowland during last minute studio sessions with producer Tricky Stewart, which spawned a female empowerment song called [...] "I'm Dat Chick". Although [...] "Rose Colored Glasses" [...] was omitted from the US track listing, Dean's song [...] "I'm Dat Chick" [...] made the album appearing as the opening song. Written as a [...] "confidence-boosting" [...] anthem, [...] "I'm Dat Chick" [...] is built around an urban-electro club beat designed to get [...] "even shy women to come out of their shells" [...] according to Rap-Up magazine. Meanwhile, Dean's third contribution, [...] "Lay It on Me", features rapper Big Sean and centers on an up-tempo R melody with 808s and high NRG-led production. It features a [...] "tinkling piano" [...] melody and light R beat.|$|E
