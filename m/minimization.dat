40|$|We {{study the}} Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) method for solving the highly {{nonlinear}} and ill-posed inverse problem of identifying the Robin coefficients in elliptic and parabolic systems. The L-M method transforms the Tikhonov regularized nonlinear non-convex <b>minimizations</b> into convex <b>minimizations.</b> And the quadratic convergence of the L-M method is rigorously {{established for the}} nonlinear elliptic and parabolic inverse problems for the first time, under a simple novel adaptive strategy for selecting regularization parameters during the L-M iteration. Then the surrogate functional approach is adopted to solve the strongly ill-conditioned convex <b>minimizations,</b> resulting in an explicit solution of the minimisation at each L-M iteration for both the elliptic and parabolic cases. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the methods. Comment: 18 pages; 4 figure...|$|R

A control theory approach is adopted, using the compressible Navier-Stokes equations {{as the basis for}} viscous design of airfoil element shapes and relative positioning. Particular considerations of aerodynamic design, high-lift systems, and the ground effect are described, and the suitability of aerodynamic shape optimization of such systems is discussed. The model of fluid flow and its discretization for solution on digital computers is investigated. A cell-centered finite-volume explicit multigrid method is used to solve both the ow and adjoint systems utilizing structured multiblock meshes. The adjoint equations for shape optimization are developed using a continuous adjoint formulation, and implemented with a moving ground boundary condition for the first time. A suite of test cases verified and validated the numerical algorithms and implementation.

40|$|We have {{developed}} new search techniques {{to deal with}} the multiple minimum problem in the computation of energy-minimized structures of DNA and DNA modified by carcinogens. These techniques have yielded atomic resolution views that agree with experimental results, and have permitted prediction of novel structures where data are lacking. In one strategy, wide searches of con-formation space are employed in combination with sub-unit buildup methods. The second strategy narrows the conformation space search to domains actually occupied by the molecule by means of measured distances that are employed as constraints in first-stage <b>minimizations,</b> but are finally released to yield unconstrained structures that are within bounds of the data. Such experimental structures are then also useful as starting forms for en-ergy <b>minimizations</b> of chemically related substances for which no data are available.
