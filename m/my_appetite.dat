I have truly given truth a {{sideways}} glance, but I swear this brought youth back to my heart. Experiment proved {{that you are the}} best that love has to offer. It is ended. Take what will not end. Never again will I whet <b>my</b> <b>appetite</b> on new loves to test the old, my one and only god of love. You are next to my heaven.
