25|$|Arnold tongues {{were first}} {{investigated}} {{for a family}} of dynamical systems on the circle first defined by Andrey Kolmogorov. Kolmogorov proposed this family as a simplified model for driven mechanical rotors (specifically, a free-spinning wheel weakly coupled by a spring to a motor). These circle map equations also describe a simplified model of the phase-locked loop in electronics. The map exhibits certain regions of its parameters where it is locked to the driving frequency (phase-locking or <b>mode-locking</b> in the language of electronic circuits). Among other applications, the circle map has been used to study the dynamical behaviour of a beating heart.|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1970s the DoE {{had been}} looking into ways to {{generate}} electricity from fusion reactions, with continuous reactions such as tokamaks or discrete fusion of small balls of light atoms. Since at the time lasers were far from having the required power, the main approach considered was heavy ion fusion. However major advances such as Q-switching and <b>mode-locking</b> made lasers an option (culminating in the National Ignition Facility) and the Heavy Ion Fusion programs became more or less dormant. In 1985, the review of DoE's program by the National Academies stated [...] "The energy crisis is dormant for the time being". Heavy ion fusion machines were tasked to help military research improve nuclear bombs.|$|E
2500|$|As laser science needed good {{theoretical}} foundations, {{and also}} because research into these soon proved very fruitful, interest in quantum optics rose. Following the work of Dirac in quantum field theory, George Sudarshan, Roy J. Glauber, and Leonard Mandel applied quantum theory to the electromagnetic field in the 1950s and 1960s to gain a more detailed understanding of photodetection and the statistics of light (see degree of coherence). This led {{to the introduction of}} the coherent state as a quantum description of laser light and the realization that some states of light could not be described with classical waves. In 1977, Kimble et al. demonstrated the first source of light which required a quantum description: a single atom that emitted one photon at a time. [...] Another quantum state of light with certain advantages over any classical state, squeezed light, was soon proposed. At the same time, development of short and ultrashort laser pulses—created by Q-switching and <b>mode-locking</b> techniques—opened the way to the study of unimaginably fast ("ultrafast") processes. Applications for solid state research (e.g. Raman spectroscopy) were found, and mechanical forces of light on matter were studied. The latter led to levitating and positioning clouds of atoms or even small biological samples in an optical trap or optical tweezers by laser beam. This, along with Doppler cooling was the crucial technology needed to achieve the celebrated Bose–Einstein condensation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mode-locking,</b> a laser {{technique}} producing pulses in the femtosecond range ...|$|E
50|$|Considering {{this in the}} {{frequency}} domain, if a mode has optical frequency ν, and is amplitude-modulated at a frequency nf, the resulting signal has sidebands at optical frequencies ν &minus; nf and ν + nf and enables much stronger <b>mode-locking</b> for shorter pulses and more stability than active <b>mode-locking,</b> but has startup problems.|$|E
50|$|The third {{method of}} active <b>mode-locking</b> is {{synchronous}} <b>mode-locking,</b> or synchronous pumping. In this, the pump source (energy source) for the laser is itself modulated, effectively turning the laser {{on and off}} to produce pulses. Typically, the pump source is itself another mode-locked laser. This technique requires accurately matching the cavity lengths of the pump laser and the driven laser.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mode-locking</b> is a {{technique}} in optics by which a laser {{can be made to}} produce pulses of light of extremely short duration, on the order of picoseconds (10−12 s) or femtoseconds (10−15 s).|$|E
50|$|For stable operation, {{the cavity}} length must {{precisely}} match {{the period of}} the modulation signal or some integer multiple of it. The most powerful technique to solve this is regenerative mode locking i.e. a part of the output signal of the mode-locked laser is detected; the beatnote at the round-trip frequency is filtered out from the detector, and sent to an amplifier, which drives the loss modulator in the laser cavity. This procedure enforces synchronism if the cavity length undergoes fluctuations due to acoustic vibrations or thermal expansion. By using this method, highly stable mode-locked lasers have been achieved. The major advantage of active <b>mode-locking</b> is that it allows synchronized operation of the mode-locked laser to an external radio frequency (RF) source. This is very useful for optical fiber communication where synchronization is normally required between optical signal and electronic control signal. Also active mode-locked fiber can provide much higher repetition rate than passive <b>mode-locking.</b> Currently, fiber lasers and semiconductor diode lasers are the two most important types of lasers where active <b>mode-locking</b> are applied.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are also}} passive <b>mode-locking</b> schemes {{that do not}} rely on {{materials}} that directly display an intensity dependent absorption. In these methods, nonlinear optical effects in intracavity components are used to provide a method of selectively amplifying high-intensity light in the cavity, and attenuation of low-intensity light. One {{of the most successful}} schemes is called Kerr-lens <b>mode-locking</b> (KLM), also sometimes called [...] "self mode-locking". This uses a nonlinear optical process, the optical Kerr effect, which results in high-intensity light being focussed differently from low-intensity light. By careful arrangement of an aperture in the laser cavity, this effect can be exploited to produce the equivalent of an ultra-fast response time saturable absorber.|$|E
50|$|A widely {{postulated}} {{mechanism for}} pitch processing {{in the early}} central auditory system is the phase-locking and <b>mode-locking</b> of action potentials to frequencies in a stimulus. Phase-locking to stimulus frequencies {{has been shown in}} the auditory nerve, the cochlear nucleus, the inferior colliculus, and the auditory thalamus. By phase- and <b>mode-locking</b> in this way, the auditory brainstem is known to preserve {{a good deal of the}} temporal and low-passed frequency information from the original sound; this is evident by measuring the auditory brainstem response using EEG. This temporal preservation is one way to argue directly for the temporal theory of pitch perception, and to argue indirectly against the place theory of pitch perception.|$|E
50|$|Active <b>mode-locking</b> is {{normally}} achieved by modulating the loss (or gain) {{of the laser}} cavity at a repetition rate equivalent to the cavity frequency, or a harmonic thereof. In practice, the modulator can be acousto-optic or electro-optic modulator, Mach-Zehnder integrated-optic modulators, or a semiconductor electro-absorption modulator (EAM). The principle of active <b>mode-locking</b> with a sinusoidal modulation. In this situation, optical pulses will form {{in such a way}} as to minimize the loss from the modulator. The peak of the pulse would automatically adjust in phase to be at the point of minimum loss from the modulator. Because of the slow variation of sinusoidal modulation, it is not very straightforward for generating ultrashort optical pulses (< 1ps) using this method.|$|E
50|$|R. L. Fork, B. I. Greene, and C. V. Shank demonstrated, in 1981, the {{generation}} of ultra-short laser pulse using a ring-dye laser (or dye laser exploiting colliding pulse <b>mode-locking).</b> Such kind of laser is capable of generating laser pulses of ~ 0.1 ps duration.|$|E
50|$|Related to this {{amplitude}} modulation (AM), active <b>mode-locking</b> is frequency modulation (FM) <b>mode-locking,</b> {{which uses a}} modulator device based on the acousto-optic effect. This device, when placed in a laser cavity and driven with an electrical signal, induces a small, sinusoidally varying frequency shift in the light passing through it. If the frequency of modulation is matched to the round-trip time of the cavity, then some light in the cavity sees repeated upshifts in frequency, and some repeated downshifts. After many repetitions, the upshifted and downshifted light is swept out of the gain bandwidth of the laser. The only light which is unaffected is that which passes through the modulator when the induced frequency shift is zero, which forms a narrow pulse of light.|$|E
50|$|A saturable {{absorber}} is {{an optical}} device that exhibits an intensity-dependent transmission. What {{this means is}} that the device behaves differently depending on the intensity of the light passing through it. For passive <b>mode-locking,</b> ideally a saturable absorber will selectively absorb low-intensity light, and transmit light which is of sufficiently high intensity. When placed in a laser cavity, a saturable absorber will attenuate low-intensity constant wave light (pulse wings). However, because of the somewhat random intensity fluctuations experienced by an un-mode-locked laser, any random, intense spike will be transmitted preferentially by the saturable absorber. As the light in the cavity oscillates, this process repeats, leading to the selective amplification of the high-intensity spikes, and the absorption of the low-intensity light. After many round trips, this leads to a train of pulses and <b>mode-locking</b> of the laser.|$|E
50|$|Methods for {{producing}} <b>mode-locking</b> in a laser may {{be classified as}} either 'active' or 'passive'. Active methods typically involve using an external signal to induce a modulation of the intracavity light. Passive methods do not use an external signal, but rely on placing some element into the laser cavity which causes self-modulation of the light.|$|E
50|$|In higher-order vector solitons, {{not only}} are the two orthogonally {{polarized}} soliton components phase-locked, but also one of the components has a double-humped intensity profile. Multiple such phase-locked high-order vector solitons with identical soliton parameters and harmonic <b>mode-locking</b> of the vector solitons have also been obtained in lasers. Numerical simulations confirmed the existence of stable high-order vector solitons in fiber lasers.|$|E
50|$|Pulse {{selection}} or pulse picking of {{a single}} laser pulse from a stream of laser pulses generated via <b>mode-locking</b> is another useful feature of some delay generators. By using the mode-locked rate as an external clock to the digital delay generator one may adjust a delay and width to select a single pulse and synchronize other events to that single pulse.|$|E
50|$|With {{the use of}} lasers, solid {{substrates}} can {{be converted}} directly into microplasmas. Solid targets are struck by high energy lasers, usually gas lasers, which are pulsed at time periods from picoseconds to femtoseconds (<b>mode-locking).</b> Successful experiments have used Ti:Sm, KrF, and YAG lasers, which {{can be applied to}} a variety of substrates such as lithium, germanium, plastics, and glass.|$|E

This has included research into macrophage-tumour interactions, neural field theories, juxtacrine intercellular signalling, the effect of predation on biological invasions, <b>mode-locking</b> of periodically stimulated bursting neurons, lung ventilation and rheumatoid arthritis. Owen is currently a Professor in applied mathematics at the University of Nottingham's School of Mathematical Sciences.|$|E
50|$|Passive <b>mode-locking</b> {{techniques}} {{are those that}} do not require a signal external to the laser (such as the driving signal of a modulator) to produce pulses. Rather, they use the light in the cavity to cause a change in some intracavity element, which will then itself produce a change in the intracavity light. A commonly used device to achieve this is a saturable absorber.|$|E
50|$|Russell Targ was {{involved}} in early laser research at Technical Research Group where he co-authored, with Gordon Gould among others, a 1962 paper describing the use of homodyne detection with laser light. Later, at Sylvania Electronic Systems, he contributed {{to the development of}} frequency modulation and <b>mode-locking</b> of lasers, and co-authored a 1969 paper which described the operation of a kilowatt continuous wave laser.|$|E
50|$|CI was {{introduced}} by Steve Shattil, a scientist at Idris Communications, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,955,992, filed February 12, 1998, {{and in the first}} of many papers in April, 1999. The concept was inspired by optical <b>mode-locking</b> in which frequency-domain synthesis using a resonant cavity produces desired time-domain features in the transmitted optical signal. In radio systems, users share the same subcarriers, but use different orthogonal CI codes to achieve Carrier Interference Multiple Access (CIMA) via spectral interferometry mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|Nonlinear optical {{materials}} are {{of great importance}} for ultrafast photonics and optoelectronics. Recently, the giant optical nonlinearities of graphene oxide (GO) has been proved useful {{for a number of}} applications. For example, the optical limiting of GO are indispensable to protect sensitive instruments from laser-induced damage. And the saturable absorption can be used for pulse compression, <b>mode-locking</b> and Q-switching. Also the nonlinear refraction (Kerr effect) is crucial for functionalities including all-optical switching, signal regeneration and fast optical communications.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{important}} applications in neuroscience for <b>Mode-locking</b> response of excitable systems to periodic forcing. For example, The theta rhythm drives the spatially extended place {{cells in the}} hippocampus to generate a code giving information about spatial location. The role of neuronal dentrites in generating the response to periodic current injection can be explored by using a compartmental model (with linear dynamics for each compartment) coupled to an active soma model that generates action potentials.|$|E
50|$|When {{a string}} is bowed or tone in a wind {{instrument}} initiated by vibrating reed or lips, a phenomenon called <b>mode-locking</b> counteracts the natural inharmonicity of the string or air column and causes the overtones to lock precisely onto integer multiples {{of the fundamental}} pitch, even though these are slightly different from the natural resonance points of the instrument. For this reason, a single tone played by a bowed string instrument, brass instrument, or reed instrument does not necessarily exhibit inharmonicity.|$|E
50|$|Other laser cavity topologies {{such as the}} ring-cavity design, which {{requires}} a transmission-mode device, which offers advantages such as doubling the repetition rate for a given cavity length, and which is less sensitive to reflection-induced instability {{with the use of}} optical isolators, is not possible unless an optical circulator is employed, which increases cavity loss and laser complexity; SESAMs also suffer from a low optical damage threshold. But there had been no alternative saturable absorbing materials to compete with SESAMs for the passive <b>mode-locking</b> of fiber lasers.|$|E

[...] A distinct line of mode-locked lasers produced ultraviolet output at 355 nm, used for fluorescence excitation in flow cytometry applications. <b>Mode-locking</b> was passive, using a semiconductor saturable absorber. In the late 1990s Lightwave Electronics produced a Nd:YAG laser internally frequency doubled to 532 nm with potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP), used in ophthalmology.|$|E
