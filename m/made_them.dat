5|$|Although the s were a {{significant}} improvement from the preceding , especially with the 3,000-ton displacement increase, they were outclassed by {{the advent of the}} dreadnought well before they were completed. This, combined with other poor traits, including the great weight in coal they had to carry, <b>made</b> <b>them</b> rather unsuccessful ships, though their numerous rapid-firing guns were of some use in the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of this attack, a 4-inch Mark III QF gun was erected on a {{promontory}} overlooking Village Bay, but it never saw action against the enemy. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders were the introduction of regular {{contact with the outside world}} and the slow development of a money-based economy. This made life easier for the St Kildans but also <b>made</b> <b>them</b> less self-reliant. Both were factors in the evacuation of the island little more than a decade later.|$|E

5|$|Balzac {{borrowed}} {{money from his}} family and friends, and tried to build a printing business, then a typefounder enterprise. His inexperience and lack of capital caused his ruin in these trades. He gave the businesses to a friend (who <b>made</b> <b>them</b> successful) but carried the debts for many years. As of April 1828 Balzac owed 50,000 francs to his mother.|$|E
5|$|Between 1893 and 1904, Italy {{laid down}} eight battleships; the later {{two classes of}} ship were remarkably fast, though the Regina Margherita class was poorly {{protected}} and the Regina Elena class lightly armed. In some ways, these ships presaged {{the concept of the}} battlecruiser. The Austro-Hungarian Empire also saw a naval renaissance during the 1890s, though of the nine pre-dreadnought battleships ordered only the three of the Habsburg class arrived before Dreadnought herself <b>made</b> <b>them</b> obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Formed by Sumner and Hook {{after the}} two {{attended}} a Sex Pistols gig, Joy Division soon moved beyond their punk roots to develop a sound and style that <b>made</b> <b>them</b> {{one of the pioneers}} of the late-1970s post-punk movement. The band's self-released 1978 debut EP, An Ideal for Living, drew the attention of the Manchester television personality Tony Wilson, who signed the group to his independent label Factory Records. Joy Division's debut album Unknown Pleasures, recorded with producer Martin Hannett, was released in 1979 to critical acclaim.|$|E

5|$|Hartmann {{said the}} German pilots {{themselves}} still learned from their enemy. Oil freezing in the DB 605 engines of the Bf109G-6s <b>made</b> <b>them</b> difficult {{to start in}} the extreme cold of the Russian winter. A captured Soviet airman showed them how pouring fuel into the aircraft's oil sump would thaw the oil and enable the engine to start on the first try. Another solution, also learned from the Soviets, was to ignite fuel under the engine.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the Provincial Government of Albacete {{presented}} Pablo, Santi Denia, and Andrés Iniesta {{with the}} Medalla de Oro de Honor y Gratitud (Gold Medal of Honour and Gratitude), {{not only for}} their footballing prowess, as the only three natives of the province {{to play for the}} senior national team, but also in recognition of personal qualities that <b>made</b> <b>them</b> an example for the youth of the region.|$|E

5|$|In a Swiss {{study of}} the {{nominate}} subspecies, 76% of eggs hatched, and 58% of chicks fledged. Birds of the race A. s. blakistoni in the Tian Shan hatched 90% of their eggs, and hatchlings survived to fledging in 47% of the nests. In the latter study, early nests {{were more likely to}} fail because less plant cover <b>made</b> <b>them</b> more likely to be found by predators. Neither the average lifespan nor the maximum age of survival are known.|$|E
5|$|In the 1780s, Catherine {{slightly}} favored Poniatowski {{over the}} opposition, {{but did not}} support any of his plans for significant reforms. Despite repeated attempts, Poniatowski failed to confederate the sejms, which would have <b>made</b> <b>them</b> immune to liberum veto. Thus, although he had {{a majority in the}} Sejms, Poniatowski was unable to pass even the smallest reform. The Zamoyski Code was rejected by the Sejm of 1780, and opposition attacks on the king dominated the Sejms of 1782 and 1786.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} its capture, {{all of the}} mosques and Roman Catholic churches in Jajce were demolished as retribution for the HVO's destruction of the town's only Serbian Orthodox monastery in mid-October. The VRS converted the town's Franciscan monastery into a prison and its archives, museum collections and artworks were looted; the monastery church was completely destroyed. By 1992, all religious buildings in Jajce had been destroyed, save for two mosques whose perilous positioning on a hilltop <b>made</b> <b>them</b> unsuitable for demolition.|$|E

5|$|Labradors are {{powerful}} and indefatigable swimmers noted {{for their ability}} to tolerate the coldest of water for extended periods of time.

5|$|Lazica {{had been}} a Byzantine client state since 522, when its king, Tzath I, had {{rejected}} Persian hegemony. However, during the rule of Emperor Justinian I (reigned 527–565), a series of heavy-handed Byzantine measures <b>made</b> <b>them</b> unpopular. In particular, {{the establishment of a}} trade monopoly by the magister militum (general) John Tzibus, which was regulated from the newly constructed fortress of Petra, drove Gubazes to seek once again the protection of the Persian shah, Khosrau I (r. 531–579).|$|E
5|$|Majure {{was a man}} who {{yearned to}} please his passengers, and if he <b>made</b> <b>them</b> happy then he also made his airline happy.

All the same, he was also portrayed as a by-the-book, cautious pilot.|$|E
