40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a framework for}} bandwidth allocation and scheduling in the Agile All-Photonic Network (AAPN). This framework is also applicable to any single-hop communication network with significant signalling delay (such as satellite-TDMA systems). Slot-by-slot scheduling approaches do not provide adequate performance for wide-area networks, so we focus on frame-based scheduling. We propose three novel fixed-length frame scheduling algorithms (Minimum Cost Search, Fair Matching and <b>Minimum</b> <b>Rejection)</b> and a feedback control system for stabilization. MCS is a greedy algorithm, which allocates time-slots sequentially using a cost function. This function is defined such that the time-slots with higher blocking probability are assigned first. MCS does not guarantee 100 % throughput, thought it has a low blocking percentage. Our optimum scheduling approach is based on modifying the demand matrix such that the network resources are fully utilized, while the requests are optimally served. The Fair Matching Algorithm (FMA) uses the weighted max-min fairness criterion to achieve {{a fair share of}} resources amongst the connections in the network. When rejection is inevitable, FMA selects rejections such that the maximum percentage rejection experienced in the network is minimized. In another approach we formulate the rejection task as an optimization problem and propose the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Rejection</b> Algorithm (MRA), which minimizes total rejection. The <b>minimum</b> <b>rejection</b> problem is a special case of maximum flow problem. Due to the complexity of the algorithms that solve the max-flow problem we propose a heuristic algorithm with lower complexity. Scheduling in wide-area networks must be based on predictions of traffic demand and the resultant errors can lead to instability and unfairness. We design a feedback control system based on Smith's principle, which removes the destabilizing delays from the feedback loop by using a "loop cancelation" technique. The feedback control system we propose reduces the effect of prediction errors, increasing the speed of the response to sudden changes in traffic arrival rates and improving the fairness in the network through equalization of queue-lengths...|$|E

The increased vulnerability of the components to various electrical, thermal, mechanical, chemical and electromagnetic stresses poses a big threat in attaing the reliability required for various mission critical applications. Derating can be defined as the practice of limiting electrical, thermal and mechanical stresses on devices to levels below their specified or proven capabilities in order to enhance reliability. If a system is expected to be reliable, one of the major contributing factors must be a conservative design approach incorporating part derating. Realizing a need for derating of electronic and electromechanical parts, many manufacturers have established internal guidelines for derating practices. In this project, a notch filter circuit is used in an aerospace application is selected. Circuit simulation will be carried out by using E-CAD Tools. Further Derating analysis will be done as in the methodology given in MIL-STD- 975 A and provide design margin against this standard as well.

The morphing radiator employs SMA materials to passively change its shape to adapt its rate of heat rejection to vehicle requirements. Conceptually, the radiator panel has a naturally closed position (like a cylinder) in a cold environment.

40|$|Thermal {{control is}} an {{important}} aspect of spacecraft design, particularly in the case of crewed vehicles, which must maintain a precise internal temperature at all times in spite of sometimes drastic variations in the external thermal environment and internal heat loads. The successes of the Apollo, Space Shuttle, and International Space Station programs have shown that this can be accomplished for short-term missions to the Moon and long-term missions to Low Earth Orbit (LEO); however, crewed spacecraft traveling beyond LEO are expected to encounter more challenging thermal conditions with significant variations in both the heat rejection requirements and environment temperature. Such missions will require radiator systems with high turndown ratios, defined as the ratio between the maximum and <b>minimum</b> heat <b>rejection</b> rates achievable by the radiator system. Current radiators are only able to achieve turndown ratios of 3 : 1, far less than the 12 : 1 turndown ratio which is expected to be required on future missions. An innovative radiator concept, known as a morphing radiator, uses the temperature-induced shape change of shape memory alloy (SMA) materials to achieve a turndown ratio of at least 12 : 1. Predicting the behavior of morphing radiators requires analysis tools that are capable of accurately representing the driving physics. However, developing mathematical and computational models of morphing radiators is challenging due to the presence of a unique type of two-way thermomechanical coupling. This coupling is not present in traditional, fixed-geometry radiators and has not been widely considered in the literature. Furthermore, although many existing simulation tools are capable of analyzing certain types of thermomechanically coupled problems, general problems involving radiation and deformation cannot be modeled natively in these tools. This work presents an analysis framework which has been developed to overcome these present shortcomings. Several example problems are used to demonstrate the ability of the framework to simulate realistic problems involving morphing radiators. In addition, a prototype morphing radiator was designed, fabricated, and subsequently tested in a thermal environment similar to one in which the radiator is expected to operate on a future mission. Following the experimental study, a detailed finite element model of the prototype was developed and executed using the framework. In spite of some discrepancies resulting from shortcomings in the SMA constitutive model, the model predictions generally agree with the experimental data, giving confidence that the framework is able to accurately represent the thermomechanical coupling present in morphing radiators...|$|R

The area and the top electrode thickness of the series and shunt resonators are optimized to achieve the bandpass response with maximum out of band <b>rejection,</b> <b>minimum</b> insertion loss and sharper roll off near the pass band. A 3 rd order T-type bandpass filter for 5 GHz applications is designed. The insertion loss of - 2. 925 dB is achieved. The filter exhibits the 3 dB bandwidth of 176 MHz and out of band rejection of - 10 dB. DC bias of 0 - 25 V is used to analyze the tuning behavior of the filter.   The electromagnetic co-simulation is also done in momentum to analyze the parasitic effects between the resonators. The results show the good agreement between the schematic and momentum simulation. Layout and masks are also designed on a 10 * 10 mm wafer that will be used later to fabricate the filter and further investigations...|$|R
