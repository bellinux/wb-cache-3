25|$|In {{order for}} San José <b>Mogote</b> to attain this regional, {{economic}} and political dominance, in all likely events, for San José <b>Mogote</b> itself to become a regional leader, the people of San José <b>Mogote</b> must have first elected an individual powerful enough to influence and persuade people living in local villages to cooperate with them. The scale of buildings and the materials imported to erect them clearly indicate that San José Mogote’s leaders were able to control people in the surrounding countryside.|$|E
25|$|San José <b>Mogote</b> is a pre-Columbian {{archaeological site}} of the Zapotec, a Mesoamerican culture that flourished {{in the region of}} what is now the Mexican state of Oaxaca. A forerunner to the better-known Zapotec site of Monte Albán, San José <b>Mogote</b> was the largest and most {{important}} settlement in the Valley of Oaxaca during the Early and Middle Formative periods (ca. 1500-500 BCE) of Mesoamerican cultural development.|$|E

25|$|In the Valley of Oaxaca, San José <b>Mogote</b> {{represents}} one of the oldest permanent agricultural villages in the area, {{and one of the first}} to use pottery. During the Early and Middle Preclassic, the site developed some of the earliest examples of defensive palisades, ceremonial structures, the use of adobe, and hieroglyphic writing. Also of importance, the site was one of the first to demonstrate inherited status, signifying a radical shift in socio-cultural and political structure. San José <b>Mogote</b> was eventual overtaken by Monte Albán, the subsequent capital of the Zapotec empire, during the Late Preclassic.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{conducted over}} the previous two decades (e.g., by Kent Flannery and Joyce Marcus) have built an emerging picture of San José <b>Mogote</b> as an early center of Zapotec culture, which was later supplanted or overtaken by Monte Albán. From its beginnings as a cluster of family dwellings San José <b>Mogote</b> grew to incorporate monumental public structures indicative of a larger and complex political center that ruled {{over a number of}} subsidiary settlements in the Valley of Oaxaca, receiving tribute and services from the region. For as-yet unclear reasons, its status diminished and it became a tributary to the new Zapotec political center and capital, Monte Albán.|$|E

50|$|Cambalache {{is located}} in the {{municipalities}} of Arecibo and Barceloneta. It protects steep limestone hills known as <b>mogotes,</b> which are covered in moist forests. The elevation ranges from 5 to 50 m above mean sea level. Average rainfall is 1479.8 mm per year, with the temperature varying from 23.3 to 27 C. <b>Mogotes</b> oriented northeast to southeast have humid northern and southwestern slopes but xeric tops.

25|$|Two primary motifs {{are found}} on pottery vessels from the Valley of Oaxaca: {{the forces of}} earth and sky, symbolically {{represented}} by earthquakes or lightning, respectively. Small villages tended to have pottery vessels with lightning, or sky, motifs. Tierras Largas had pottery that favored earthquake, or earth, motifs. And San José <b>Mogote</b> had a mixture of both.|$|E
25|$|Crop {{productivity}} {{may have}} seen an increase at San José <b>Mogote</b> due to the initiation of two simple irrigation techniques: Pot irrigation and Irrigation ditches. Pot irrigation involved digging many shallow wells in order to accumulate water, and then scooping up that water to use on surrounding plants. Irrigation ditches were small-scale systems used to tap into streams {{in order to allow}} water to flow over the plants.|$|E
25|$|Canóvanas {{combines}} flat alluvial plains in {{the center}} and north, areas with both gentle hills and rugged, deeply dissected mountainous areas made up of volcaniclastic rocks (lava flows and exposed intrusive igneous rocks) to the southeast and south. The Cuchilla de Santa Inés, a limestone hill (<b>mogote)</b> with an elevation of 328 feet, rises from coastal sediments on the northeast of the city near San Isidro, while the Cuchilla El Asomante lies at the south with elevations that range from 656 to 2,296 feet.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mogotes</b> are conical {{mountains}} {{composed of}} karstic limestone and {{are found in}} western Cuba. Forests found on <b>mogotes</b> are characterized by a discontinuous story of trees 5 - 10 m high, as well as palms, plentiful succulents, epiphytes, and lianas. Plant life includes palma barrigona de sierra (Gaussia princeps), guanito de sierra (Thrinax morrisii), roble (Tabebuia calcicola), piñón (Erythrina cubensis), Malpighia roigiana, palma corcho (Microcycas calocoma), Lantana strigosa, Agave spp., and Leptocereus spp. The vegetation on rock faces is bushy and very open and includes shrubs and trees with specially adapted roots, such as the endemic ceibón (Pachira emarginata).|$|R

2500|$|According to John E. Clark, [...] "by {{the end of}} the San Jose Phase, San Jose <b>Mogote</b> was clearly...a chiefdom". It is {{not known}} {{precisely}} when or how hereditary inequalities emerged at San Jose <b>Mogote</b> (or anywhere else in Mesoamerica, for that matter) but there are some excellent indicators that give clues as to how this transformation took place and how it was exploited at San Jose <b>Mogote.</b>|$|E
2500|$|By 700 BC the {{population}} of San José <b>Mogote</b> continued to increase. [...] Between 700 and 500 BC, 3500 people occupied the Valley of Oaxaca, with about 1000 living at San José <b>Mogote,</b> which covered approximately 60 Hectares (150 acres) (Evans 2004, p.187). Major public buildings constructed with adobe bricks and large blocks of stone were built on top of dirt mounds. [...] The largest complex of the area prior to 500 BCE was Mound 1 at San José <b>Mogote,</b> which was constructed atop a hill that was augmented to a height of 15 m (50 feet).|$|E
5000|$|Gaussia princeps, {{commonly}} known as palma de sierra, is a palm which is endemic to Cuba. [...] The species grows on steep-sided limestone hills (known as <b>mogotes)</b> in Pinar del Río Province in western Cuba.|$|R
50|$|It is an endemic palm of <b>Mogotes</b> de Jumagua in {{northern}} Cuba. This absolutely unique little treasure survives only on {{three of the}} small <b>mogotes</b> where it was rediscovered in 1978 by a Group of paleontologists and naturalists looking for fossils in the caverns and cataloging the fauna and flora of these small mountains (Sabaneque Speleological Group). A small number under 100 individuals cling to the steep cliffs. The Jumagua Palm has a gray trunk about 5 cm in diameter holding a spherical and very dense crown of stiff, spiky light green leaves that have almost no stalks and therefore sit very close together.|$|R
25|$|By 500 BCE, {{with the}} {{emergence}} of Monte Albán as the area's main city, San José <b>Mogote's</b> 1000 years of dominance ended, and it was relegated to the status of a lesser community that fell under Monte Albán's control.|$|R
