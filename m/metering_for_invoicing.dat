40|$|Abstract. Large IT {{systems are}} often {{acquired}} in a tender process where the customer states the system requirements, {{a number of}} suppliers submit their proposals, and the customer selects one of them. Usually the supplier uses an existing system as basis for his proposal. He adapts it more or less to the customer's requirements. This paper is a study of a specific tender process. The customer was a Danish municipality that supplied electrical power, water, gas, garbage collection, etc. for around 100, 000 households. The customer wanted a new system <b>for</b> <b>meter</b> inspection, <b>invoicing,</b> planning the meter inspector's routes, etc. We have studied the requirements, how they were perceived by the suppliers, {{and how they were}} intended by the customer. The main findings are that the parties didn't understand each other, although the suppliers sometimes pretended that they did so. One consequence was that the business goals pursued by the customer were not properly achieved. Among the causes of this were an excessive democratic elicitation process and an inadequate use of requirements techniques, particularly use cases. There were also issues that existing requirements techniques couldn't deal with, for instance integration with future systems...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{article for}} the first time uses Brazilian trade data to draw {{conclusions}} about the invoice currency choice — both in general and as it pertains to the Brazilian real (BRL). We find that the Brazil-Argentina policy of providing payment orders associated to an exchange transaction between their currencies has {{had a significant impact on}} the currency chosen <b>for</b> <b>invoicing,</b> establishing a link between the availability of financial instruments and the invoice currency choice. Moreover, the evidence does not confirm some previous international results. We identify that in Brazil there is no coincidence regarding the use of BRL <b>for</b> <b>invoicing</b> and its use for making payments. Yet we find that the main exports denominated in BRL are homogenous goods — sugar and tobacco — suggesting that some bargaining power might remain even if goods are traded in international markets. From the BRL-specific perspective, we categorically move away from the idea that the BRL is not used in Brazilian international trade. Although it is used at a limited absolute volume, an exceptional ninefold growth between 2007 and 2011 is observed. New intriguing questions about Brazilian currency usage can therefore be proposed...|$|R
