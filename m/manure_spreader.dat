It was named for James Borucki, a British soldier who died in an IRA bombing in Crossmaglen on 8 August 1976. The device consisted of a <b>manure</b> <b>spreader</b> which doused the facility with fuel, ignited few seconds later by a small explosion. A nine meters-high fireball engulfed the tower. Four British soldiers inside were rescued by a Saxon armored vehicle.|$|E

The travel speed of each application pass was not constant, and the variation ranged from 0. 9 - 1. 6 m/s. The standard deviation of an individual track distance did not significantly change. However, there was a maximum change of 2. 5 m between each track distance in the test field. The results show the differences in compost application rate are due to the changes in travel speeds and track distances. [URL]...|$|R

50|$|Joseph Oppenheim (March 1, 1859 - November 24, 1901) was an {{educator}} {{who invented the}} modern widespread <b>manure</b> <b>spreader</b> that made farming less labor-intensive and far more efficient in the early 20th century, and only he is honored for that invention in the Ohio Agricultural Hall of Fame in Columbus, Ohio.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the farming}} {{communities}} of Ohio, fertilization of fields was possible {{only by the}} distribution of animal excrement, usually mixed with bedding straw to create a semi-solid mixture of manure. The task of shoveling and distributing the manure was backbreaking {{and there were many}} attempts made to mechanize this process. One such example was a patent by a Daniel Merrell in 1886 for a mechanized [...] "manure spreader". [...] There were a number of other patent filings prior to the onset of the 20th century. In 1899 John M Kramer, Fred Heckman and Henry Synck, Jr., all of whom lived in the small farming community of Maria Stein, OH were awarded a patent for a device to spread manure which they named a [...] "manure distributor". Synck subsequently worked with his future father-in-law, Joseph Oppenheim, to develop the first practical <b>manure</b> <b>spreader.</b> Oppenheim's 1900 invention was so successful that it spawned a major manufacturing company, the New Idea Spreader Works, later renamed the New Idea Farm Machinery Company in 1899. New Idea celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1999 as a division of AGCO. Synck's role in the evolution of <b>manure</b> <b>spreader</b> and other farm machinery technology is well documented by a steady stream of patents that not only describe improvements to the <b>manure</b> <b>spreader,</b> but also other farm machinery from 1899 to 1939.|$|E
5000|$|In 1904 {{the company}} {{changed its name}} to the New Idea Spreader Company and demand for its <b>manure</b> <b>spreaders</b> {{increased}} steadily until it soon outgrew its first little shop. On July 1, 1907, the New Idea Spreader Company, while maintaining operations at Maria Stein, opened a factory in nearby Coldwater, Ohio where it had the advantage of two railroads on which it could ship the spreaders. [...] In 1912, all operations were moved to a new 220000 sq ft factory on twenty acres in Coldwater with all machinery driven by electricity. By 1916 the New Idea Spreader Company had branches in eight states and an assembly plant in Guelph, Ontario. “The net assets of the firm were over one million dollars with total sales for that year of $1,250,000.” [...] Eight years later, in 1924, the factory was turning out 125 <b>manure</b> <b>spreaders</b> in an eight-hour day and had a profit of two million dollars.|$|R

50|$|In 1899, Joseph Oppenheim, the {{inventor}} of the first mechanized <b>manure</b> <b>spreader,</b> established the New Idea Spreader works in Maria Stein.

50|$|The first {{railroad}} station was a <b>manure</b> <b>spreader</b> {{on the south}} side of the track equipped with the necessary wiring and telegraph instruments for receiving and sending messages on the movement of trains. A new station was built in 1887. Frank Lacy was the first agent but was a telegraph operator only. There were no tickets for sale and passengers paid their fares on the train. The station was enlarged in 1926.|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} size of farm equipment, {{the potential for}} soil compaction has become a real problem. According to some grain farmers, compaction from manure spreading equipment is a factor limiting their acceptance of slurry as a soil building and soil fertility resource. To {{address the issue of}} compaction caused by <b>manure</b> <b>spreaders,</b> eight on-farm sites were set up in the fall of 2004 and spring of 2005. At each site three treatments were applied (manure, farmer’s check, and tanker compaction only), and replicated three times. In addition to the on-farm trials, an on-station site was set up in Arlington. The on-station site examined the impact of multiple passes of heavy slurry equipment as might occur on field roads or headlands. After one year of field trials, it appears that compaction from <b>manure</b> <b>spreaders</b> does not adversely affect corn yields when it is applied in reasonably dry conditions. There {{was no significant difference between}} the three treatments in seven of the eight on-farm sites. Despite non-significant differences at the plot scale, hand harvests of the on-station trial showed a 10 to 15 % reduction in corn yield for rows that were directly within the tire track when there were multiple passes...|$|R

5000|$|Hepburn {{represented}} {{a type of}} agrarian democracy that detested Toryism and valued oratory. He once saw a pile of manure situated in a village square, and proceeded to jump {{on top of it}} to give a speech, apologizing to the crowd for speaking from a Tory platform.

5000|$|Henry Synck, Jr. {{was born}} in Saint Sebastian, Ohio. He married Wilhelmina Oppenheim, the {{daughter}} of Joseph Oppenheim, a teacher in Maria Stein, Ohio. In 1899 Synck's father-in law, Joseph Oppenheim invented the most {{important component of the}} first practical mechanical <b>manure</b> <b>spreader.</b> Oppenheim conceived the idea of a practical <b>manure</b> <b>spreader</b> during a game of paddle ball. [...] He noted that [...] "when a player held the paddle-shaped bat at an angle, a foul ball resulted, with the ball careening off at the angle dictated by the paddle. Why not, pondered Oppenheim, make manure do the same thing - fly out at an angle from a series of paddles?" [...] Earlier patent ideas, including that described by Kramer, Heckman and Synck (above) had a distributive mechanism that was flawed in that the width of distribution was relatively narrow. Oppenheim subsequently developed a model from a cigar box and demonstrated the feasibility of distributing manure in a [...] "wide spread pattern". Oppenheim's patent clearly describes the distribution mechanism Manure was loaded into the spreader. A mechanism moved the manure to the rear where it was distributed by paddles.|$|E
50|$|The first {{successful}} automated <b>manure</b> <b>spreader</b> {{was designed by}} Joseph Kemp in 1875. Manure spreaders began as ground-driven units which could be pulled by a horse or team of horses. At {{the time of his}} invention, he was living near Magog, Quebec, Canada, but thereafter, he moved to Newark Valley, NY and formed the J.S. Kemp Manufacturing Co. to manufacture and market his current and subsequent designs. In 1903, he expanded the company to Waterloo, Iowa before selling the design to International Harvester, in 1906.|$|E
5000|$|Only two <b>manure</b> <b>spreaders</b> were {{produced}} {{the first year}} of operation and fourteen the following year. Oppenheim did not live long enough to realize any financial reward, for he died on November 24, 1901 as one of the victims of typhoid fever that struck the small village. [...] But his wife, Anna Mary, carried on operations of the New Idea Spreader Works by using the money obtained from Joseph’s insurance policy. Joseph’s son, B.C. Oppenheim, became the president in place of his father and Henry Synck was in charge of production. [...] Not only did the business carry on, it thrived on brisk sales of the New Idea spreader.|$|R
50|$|In 1893 the Moses Stahly {{family moved}} to Reno County, Kansas, {{as a result of}} the Windmill Controversy. It {{revolved}} around the introduction of windmills to pump water and <b>manure</b> <b>spreaders</b> and other mechanized horse-drawn farming implements. The more conservative Amish removed themselves from the area rather than adopt the modern machines. The Stahly farm was purchased by Noah Nissley, Stahly’s father-in-law. The Nissley family came from Ohio where their house had recently burned. They built a near replica of their Ohio house on the farm, connecting it to the original two-room clapboard house. The Nissleys moved into the gross-daadi house upon retirement from active farming and son-in-law Manasses Kuhns took over the operation. The Stahly-Nissley-Kuhns farm is now listed in The National Register of Historic Places.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to improve the performances of the <b>manure</b> <b>spreaders</b> used by farmers. The principal aim {{of this paper is}} to show the chosen way to improve longitudinal distribution of this machinery. A prototype was developed and evaluated in Cemagref at Montoldre. The method consists in controlling the speed of the scraper conveyor regarding the height of the gate during the hopper unloading. The gate is able to follow the product profile. It is technically based on an electronic and automatic adaptation of the scrapper conveyor speed in regard with the alimentation section of the beaters and the spreader velocity into the field. For each product, the longitudinal flow rate result is improved according to the EN 13080 Standard. Using this technique, the percentage of time spent in the tolerance zone is almost doubled compared to tests without control for the composted products and the longitudinal variation coefficient divided by 2 or 3 depending on the types of products...|$|R
