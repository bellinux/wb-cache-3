25|$|Following {{the death}} of Councillor Alex Calvert, a {{by-election}} {{was held in the}} Kilmacolm ward on 8 February 2001. Turnout fell to 43.9%, down from 65.3% in the 1999 election, and turned Kilmacolm into a Conservative-Liberal Democrat <b>marginal</b> <b>area,</b> with the Conservatives' (represented by the former councillor's wife, Helen Calvert) lead being slashed 29% to 6% over the Lib Dems who rose from fourth to second place in the poll. In 2003, Liberal Democrat Tom Fyfe was elected by a narrow margin in Kilmacolm, also marking the return of control of Inverclyde Council from Labour to the Lib Dems.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a general comparative analysis of {{two kinds of}} approach - linear "disciplinary" and non-linear "trans-disciplinary" - used {{in the assessment of}} <b>marginal</b> <b>areas.</b> These approaches reflect different kinds of thinking about <b>marginal</b> <b>areas</b> more than describe specific modelling techniques. The analysis emphasises the key characteristics of each approach, as well as major advantages and disadvantages of each approach's application to define and resolve issues of planning in <b>marginal</b> <b>areas.</b> As a case example for contextualising our discussion of the two approaches, we use our experiences and data from the Sumava Mountains, an environmentally wealthy and sensitive area along the southern boundary of the Czech Republic. Understanding the particular nuances of linear and non-linear approaches in practice will help planners to develop successful solutions to problems in <b>marginal</b> <b>areas.</b> cultural capital; linearity; marginality; national park; non-linearity. ...|$|R

30|$|The paper {{describes}} {{recent changes}} in pastoral systems in Italy and provides an assessment of current farming systems in <b>marginal</b> <b>areas</b> of the country, where extensive livestock rearing still represents an option. Despite public financial support, rural farming in <b>marginal</b> <b>areas</b> increasingly has to find its place within the wider society, integrate into wider markets, support employment and diversify income generation. Provision of environmental as well as recreational services is increasingly complementing quality food production. The heterogeneous Italian landscape provides important opportunities to better integrate crops, trees and livestock into increasingly sustainable agro-silvo-pastoral systems.|$|R

30|$|Climate {{change has}} {{resulted}} in increased vulnerability of smallholder farmers in <b>marginal</b> <b>areas</b> of Zimbabwe where there is limited capacity to adapt to changing climate. One approach {{that has been used}} to adapt to changing climate is in-field water harvesting for improved crop yields in the semi- arid regions of Zimbabwe. This review analyses the history of soil and water conservation in Zimbabwe, efforts of improving water harvesting in the post independence era, farmer driven innovations, water harvesting technologies from other regions, and future directions of water harvesting in semi arid <b>marginal</b> <b>areas.</b> From this review it was observed that the blanket recommendations that were made on the early conservation method were not suitable for <b>marginal</b> <b>areas</b> as they resulted in increased losses of the much needed water. In the late 1960 and 70 s’, soil and water conservation efforts was a victim of the political environment and this resulted in poor uptake. Most of the water harvesting innovations which were promoted in the 1990 s’ and some farmer driven innovations improved crop yields in <b>marginal</b> <b>areas</b> but were poorly taken up by farmers because they are labour intensive as the structures should be made annually. To address the challenges of labour shortages, the use of permanent in-field water harvesting technologies are an option. There is also need to identify ways for promoting water harvesting techniques that have been proven to work and to explore farmer-led knowledge sharing platforms for scaling up proven technologies.|$|R
40|$|Since 1970, rice {{farming in}} Hokkaido has been reorganized. The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to point out characteristics and condition of rice farming at the present stage in the <b>marginal</b> <b>areas</b> in Hokkaido. The main points mentioned in this paper are as follows. 1. The <b>marginal</b> <b>areas</b> of rice farming in Hokkaido are in the north of Kamikawa district, in the north of Rumoi district, in the center of Abashiri district and in the center of Tokachi district. After 1970, these <b>marginal</b> <b>areas</b> became the main producing areas of glutinous rice in Hokkaido. In 1993, about 80 percent of the total areas for glutinous rice in Hokkaido were in these marginal regions. 2. In the main areas in which glutinous rice is planted, there are two types of rice farming. One is the type in which rice is a major crop. Many in this type are in Kamikawa district. Another is the type in which rice is a minor crop. Many in this type are in Abashiri district...|$|R
