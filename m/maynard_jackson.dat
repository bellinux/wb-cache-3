2500|$|The {{original}} [...] of Oakland {{remains one}} of the oldest historical plots of land in Atlanta, {{most of the rest of}} the city having been burned in 1864. Because of its age and location, the cemetery directly reflects the history and changing culture of the City of Atlanta and the significant events it has seen. Names of Atlanta streets, buildings, parks, subdivisions, and more can be found within the cemetery gates. An estimated 70,000 people are interred at Oakland, and while the last plots were sold in 1884, there are still regular burials today. These are largely conducted on family-owned plots or areas owned by Atlanta (one of the most recent being former mayor <b>Maynard</b> <b>Jackson,</b> whose plot was contributed by the city).|$|E
2500|$|The airport's {{terminal}} {{until the}} 1970s was located off Virginia Avenue, {{on the north}} side of the airport. It was designed around six pier concourses radiating from a central building. Construction began on the present midfield terminal in January 1977 under the administration of Mayor <b>Maynard</b> <b>Jackson.</b> It was the largest construction project in the South, costing $500 million. The complex was designed by Stevens & Wilkinson, Smith Hinchman & Grylls, and Minority Airport Architects & Planners. Renamed for former Atlanta mayor William B. Hartsfield, who did much to promote air travel, the airport reopened on September 21, 1980, on-time and under budget. It was designed to accommodate up to 55 million passengers per year and covered 2.5 million square feet (230,000 m²). In December 1984 a [...] fourth parallel runway was completed and another runway was extended to [...] the following year.|$|E
2500|$|This {{section of}} the {{cemetery}} {{is a testament to}} the period of history during which segregation was at its height in the United States. The entire cemetery reflects the great cultural changes that occurred in Atlanta during its service; from the Jim Crow era exhibited by the segregated black section to the modern era that strives for social equality, as shown by the recent burial of <b>Maynard</b> <b>Jackson</b> on a plot in the original [...] of Oakland. One striking feature that visitors will notice is that the black section, similarly to the adjoining Potter's Field, lacks a great deal of headstones, monuments, and grave markers in general. This is because many grave markers here were made of wood and other biodegradable materials. These markers have succumbed to the passing of time and as a result have rendered a large portion of the grave sites in the black section unknown. Despite the social difficulties that had to be overcome by African-Americans living in the Southern states at the time, there are several outstanding black figures buried at Oakland who made significant contributions to the history of Atlanta. Some of these include Bishop Wesley John Gaines, Reverend Frank Quarles (an early benefactor of Morehouse College), Carrie Steele Logan, and Antoine Graves, the owner of the only mausoleum in the black section.|$|E
