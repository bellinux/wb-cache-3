40|$|AbstractPure {{titanium}} and cerium oxides {{and their}} composites were {{prepared by the}} modified method of homogeneous hydrolysis with urea as the precipitating agent. The as-synthesized nanostructured oxides were examined by XRD, XPS, microscopic techniques (SEM, HRTEM), nitrogen physisorption, and vibrational spectroscopies (FTIR, Raman). Decontamination ability of the samples towards the toxic organophosphorus compounds was determined by two methods. The reactive adsorption of the warfare agent simulant Dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) was observed by in situ FTIR spectroscopy. The degradation of the pesticide <b>parathion</b> <b>methyl</b> in a liquid medium was investigated by liquid chromatography (HPLC). Nano-ceria exhibited substantially higher degradation ability compared to nano-titania. The highest degradation efficiency was achieved with the composites with Ti:Ce 2 : 8 and 1 : 1 molar ratio.

40|$|The UK's Initial Operational Response (IOR) is {{a revised}} {{process for the}} medical {{management}} of mass casualties potentially contaminated with hazardous materials. A critical element of the IOR is the introduction of immediate, on-scene disrobing and decontamination of casualties to limit the adverse health effects of exposure. Ad hoc cleansing of the skin with dry absorbent materials has previously {{been identified as a}} potential means of facilitating emergency decontamination. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the in vitro oil and water absorbency of a range of materials commonly found in the domestic and clinical environments and to determine the effectiveness of a small, but representative selection of such materials in skin decontamination, using an established ex vivo model. Five contaminants were used in the study: <b>methyl</b> salicylate, <b>parathion,</b> diethyl malonate, phorate and potassium cyanide. In vitro measurements of water and oil absorbency did not correlate with ex vivo measurements of skin decontamination. When measured ex vivo, dry decontamination was consistently more effective than a standard wet decontamination method ("rinse-wipe-rinse") for removing liquid contaminants. However, dry decontamination was ineffective against particulate contamination. Collectively, these data confirm that absorbent materials such as wound dressings and tissue paper provide an effective, generic capability for emergency removal of liquid contaminants from the skin surface, but that wet decontamination should be used for non-liquid contaminants...|$|R

50|$|Evidence of {{exposure}} to OP pesticides during gestation and early postnatal period {{have been linked to}} neurodevelopmental effects in animals, specifically rats. Animals exposed in utero to chlorpyrifos exhibited decreased balance, poorer cliff avoidance, decreased locomotion, delays in maze performance, and increased gait abnormalities. Early gestation is believed to be a critical time period for the neurodevelopmental effects of pesticides. OP's affect the cholinergic system of fetuses, so exposure to chlorpyrifos during critical periods of brain development potentially could cause cellular, synaptic, and neurobehavioral abnormalities in animals. In rats exposed to <b>methyl</b> <b>parathion,</b> studies found reduced AChE activity in all brain regions and subtle alterations in behaviors such as locomotor activity and impaired cage emergence. Organophosphates as whole have been linked to decreases in the length of limbs, head circumference, and slower rates of postnatal weight gain in mice.|$|E
50|$|Twenty {{different}} pesticides {{were detected}} in on-site soil surface samples including diazinon, endosulfan and heptachlor epoxide, which {{were found at}} highest levels in the burn area, and disulfoton, endosulfan, merphos, and methamidophos which were found in high concentrations near the former warehouse and office. The concentrations of listed pesticides were all significantly above comparison values and therefore of concern for human and environmental health. On-site groundwater was reported to contain low levels of butyric acid, dinoseb, and endosulfan due to leaching. Only endosulfan concentrations were significantly above comparison values. On-site air analyses also found eight different pesticides at levels significantly above background levels. The eight pesticides were dacthal, diainon, endosulfan, malathion, mevinphos, maled, <b>methyl</b> <b>parathion,</b> and phorate. However, these concentrations were not enough in comparison to raise concern. Lastly, dead fish samples found in the pond contained dacthal (27.3 mg/kg), DDE (0.11 mg/kg), diazinon (0.1 mg/kg), and endosulfan (0.92 mg/kg).|$|E
5000|$|Under a 1988 {{amendment}} to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates organophosphate pesticides Its focus was initially on registering pesticides for use on food crops.

In 1996, {{with the passage of the}} Food Quality Protection Act, Congress required the EPA to reassess all existing pesticide tolerances with specific consideration for children. This resulted in a 10-year review process of the health and environmental effects of all pesticides, beginning with the organophosphates.

Some of the examined samples, especially those prepared by annealing from carbonate precursors, exhibited an outstanding ability to destroy highly toxic organophosphates, such as pesticides (<b>parathion</b> <b>methyl),</b> or nerve agents (soman, VX).

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of photocatalytic treatment with titanium dioxide in the degradation of 44 organic pesticides analyzed systematically in the Ebro river basin (Spain). The effect of the addition of hydrogen peroxide in this treatment is studied, and a monitoring of effectiveness of photocatalytic processes is carried out by measurements of physical-chemical parameters of water. The application of photocatalytic treatment with 1 [*]g[*]L− 1 of TiO 2 during 30 minutes achieves an average degradation of the studied pesticides of 48 %. Chlorine demand, toxicity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration of water are reduced. If hydrogen peroxide is added with a concentration of 10 [*]mM, the average degradation of pesticides increases up to 57 %, although chlorine demand and toxicity of water increase while DOC concentration remains unchanged with this treatment. The application of either photocatalytic treatments does not produce variations in the physical-chemical parameters of water, such as pH, conductivity, colour, dissolved oxygen, and hardness. The pesticides which are best degraded by photocatalytic treatments are <b>parathion</b> <b>methyl,</b> chlorpyrifos, α-endosulphan, 3, 4 -dichloroaniline, 4 -isopropylaniline, and dicofol while the worst degraded are HCHs, endosulphan-sulphate, heptachlors epoxide, and 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzophenone...|$|R
40|$|Cerium oxide {{belongs to}} the most {{important}} heterogeneous catalysts, but its applicability as so-called reactive sorbent for the degradation of toxic chemicals was only recently discovered. For these purposes, cerium oxide is prepared by precipitation of insoluble cerium salts (carbonates) with a subsequent thermal decomposition. Properties of cerium oxide prepared from the carbonate precursor are strongly affected by the temperature during the calcination. Main physicochemical properties of cerium oxide (specific surface area, crystallinity, and surface chemistry) were examined in dependence on the calcination temperature. As the adsorptive properties of CeO 2 are undoubtedly of great importance in the abovementioned applications, the adsorption ability was studied using an azo dye Acid Orange 7 (AO 7) as a model compound. The highest sorption efficiency towards AO 7 exhibited sorbents prepared at temperatures below 700 °C, which was attributed mainly {{to the presence of}} hydroxyl groups on the oxide surface. A strong correlation was found between an adsorption efficiency of cerium oxides and their degradation efficiency for organophosphate pesticide <b>parathion</b> <b>methyl.</b> The >Ce–OH groups on the sorbent surface are responsible for the dye binding by the surface-complexation mechanism, and probably also for the nucleophilic cleavage of the P–O–aryl bond in the pesticide molecule...|$|R
