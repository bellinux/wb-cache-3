40|$|To {{characterize}} the incidence and {{risk factors for}} monochorionic diamniotic(MC-DA) twinning after assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Retrospective population-based study. The {{study was conducted in}} China; Department of Reproductive Medicine Center at The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University. A cohort of 8860 clinical pregnancies after embryo transfer (ET) carried out in our center between 2011 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed for the incidence of MC-DA twinning. Logistic regression was used to model the effect on the incidence of MC-DA twinning after ART. Different clinical data (maternal age) and laboratory procedures (type of ET (fresh versus frozen), insemination (IVF or ICSI)), embryo stage at time of ET (cleavage or blastocyst)) on the incidence of MC-DA twinning were evaluated. Monochorionic-diamniotic pregnancies were identified when more than one fetal poles was visualized in one gestational sac via trans-vaginal ultrasound at early first-trimester (7 to 8 weeks). The overall MC-DA twinning rate was 2. 55 % (226 / 8860). Eighty one MC-DA twinnings occurred in the fresh cycles and 145 in the frozen cycles (2. 67 % vs. 2. 49 %). MC-DA twinning incidence showed no significant difference whether ICSI was performed or not (2. 79 % vs. 2. 44 %). The MZT that resulted from single embryo transfer (SET) cycles (1. 99 %) was slightly lower than multiple embryo transfer cycles (2. 61 %),but with non-significance. However, women < 35 years displayed a significant higher rate (2. 81 %) than women ≥ 35 years old (1. 16 %). Blastocyst transfer was associated with a significantly increase in MC-DA twinning incidence than cleavage-stage embryos transfer (2. 79 % VS 2. 02 %, P = 0. 008). In the results of logistic regression analysis, blastocyst transfer is a major risk factor of MZT in the fresh cycles (P = 0. 044), while maternal age plays a more important role in the frozen cycles (P = 0. 004). There is an elevated prevalence of MC-DA twinning after ART. Both maternal age and blastocyst transfer are risk factors of <b>monozygotic</b> <b>pregnancy</b> independently. Blastocyst transfer is a major risk factor of MC-DA twinning in the fresh cycles, while maternal age plays a more important role in the frozen cycles...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To present {{prenatal}} diagnosis and molecular cytogenetic characterization of trisomy 18 in a <b>monozygotic</b> twin <b>pregnancy,</b> with one structurally abnormal living fetus and one intrauterine fetal demise. Case Report: A 38 -year-old woman was referred for amniocentesis at 16 weeks of gestation because of advanced maternal age. Prenatal ultrasound revealed a <b>monozygotic</b> twin <b>pregnancy,</b> with one structurally abnormal living fetus, and one fetal demise. The body structure {{details of the}} dead fetus could not be identified, whereas holoprosencephaly and omphalocele were identified in the living fetus on prenatal ultrasound. Quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction assays using polymorphic DNA markers specific for chromosome 21 and chromosome 18, were applied to the uncultured amniocytes in the amniotic cavity of the living fetus and the cultured amniocytes in the amniotic cavity of the fetus with intrauterine fetal demise. The specimen showed a dosage ratio of 2 : 1 (paternal:maternal) for chromosome 18 -specific markers in both twins. The result was consistent with monozygosity and trisomy 18, and the trisomy 18 was possibly caused by a paternal second meiotic division non-disjunction error or a postzygotic mitotic error. Conventional cytogenetic analysis revealed a karyotype of 47,XY,+ 18 in both twins.

This is a retrospective study of 2, 316 consecutive clinical pregnancies resulting from cleavage stage transfer (CT) and blastocyst transfer (BT). Criteria examined included (i) incidences (ii) sex ratios (iii) gestational age and birth weight; (iv) perinatal outcomes of these pregnancies from cleavage stage and blastocyst transfer procedures. <b>Monozygotic</b> twin <b>pregnancies</b> were identified by (i) presence of a gestational sac containing more than one fetal pole with cardiac activity, (ii) the number of gestational sacs or fetal hearts exceeds the number of embryos transferred and (iii) twin pregnancies following a single embryo transfer. Overall the incidence of twinning was 1. 64 % (38 out of 2, 316 pregnancies). The frequency of twinning was 2. 3 × higher following BT (18 out of 649) compared to CT (20 out of 1, 667). IVF techniques skewed the sex ratio in favour of males while ICSI significantly favoured females.

40|$|Background.   Methods.     Results.     ! 30 years, {{and were}} more likely to undergo in vitro {{fertilization}} (IVF). Combined grain farming and seaso nal late blight warnings did not influence the prevalence of DZ pregnancies. Unexpectedly, the same climate variable, in combination with horticulture, was negatively associated with DZ pregnancies (PR 0. 3; 95 % confidence interval 0. 1 – 0. 7). Conclusion.     Active Norwegian farmers seem to have a somewhat higher natural occurrence of DZ pregnancies than mothers in non-farming sectors of the agricultural population. After the late 1970 s this situation was reversed, mainly because the latter group consisted of more older first-time mothers, and probably with a higher need of assisted fertility treatment. Interpretations are difficult concerning the inverse relation between DZ pregnancy and climatic conditions in horticulture. We identified 2, 131 (11. 2 per 1, 000) multiple pregnancies, 1, 322 (6. 9) were classified as DZ. The prevalence of DZ pregnancies was declining until the late 1970 s, and increased thereafter. The agricultural population of Norway is heterogeneous along two dimensions, with a difference between farmers and nonfarmers (mainly engaged in forestry), and a difference according to degree of maternal work input on the farm holding. Farmers, in particular active farmers, had more DZ pregnancies than non-farmers early in the study period; this ratio was reversed late in the study period. Non-farmers had a much higher temporal increase in the proportion of first-time mothers who were   By record linkage of national registers in Norway, we identified 246, 043 farm holders and spouses born between 1925 and 1971 in agricultural censuses and the population register. In this population, 190, 258 pregnancies were recorded in the Medical Birth Registry 1967 - 91. The prevalences of multiple pregnancy, subdivided in DZ and <b>monozygotic</b> (MZ) <b>pregnancies,</b> were examined in strata of several determinants. Exposure, defined as the combination of grain farming and categories of seasonal fungal warnings, was based on data on farm activity and on local fungal warnings in the growth seasons. Adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) served as estimates of association. SUMMARY   The worldwide occurrence of dizygotic (DZ) multiple pregnancies has increased since 1980 as a consequence of assisted fertilization techniques. An opposite influence by environmental factors yet unidentified has been a suspected explanation of decreased multiple pregnancies in several countries during 1960 - 1980. The aim of our study was to describe multiple, in particular DZ, pregnancy patterns in the Norwegian agricultural population between 1967 and 1991, and to investigate the hypothesis that grain production under climatic conditions favoring fungal growth causes a decline in DZ pregnancies. </span...|$|R

DESIGN: Population-based prevalence study based on EUROCAT congenital anomaly registries. SETTING: Eight European countries. POPULATION: 14. 8 million births 1990 - 2009; 2. 89 % multiple births. METHODS: DS cases included livebirths, fetal deaths from 20 weeks, and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFA). Zygosity is inferred from like/unlike sex for birth denominators, and from concordance for DS cases.

The adjRR of DS for <b>monozygotic</b> versus singleton <b>pregnancies</b> was 0. 34 (95 % CI 0. 25 - 0. 44) and for dizygotic versus singleton pregnancies 1. 34 (95 % CI 1. 23 - 1. 46). DS fetuses from multiple births {{were less likely to}} be prenatally diagnosed than singletons (adjOR 0. 62 [95 % CI 0. 50 - 0. 78]) and following diagnosis less likely to be TOPFA (adjOR 0. 40 [95 % CI 0. 27 - 0. 59]). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of DS per fetus/baby is lower in multiple than singleton pregnancies. These estimates can be used for genetic counselling and prenatal screening...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Nas famílias de gêmeos monozigóticos, algumas práticas podem acompanhar o processo de gestação, nascimento e desenvolvimento dessas crianças. Inclui-se a escolha de roupas iguais ou com diferença apenas na cor, nomes com semelhanças fonéticas, rotinas parecidas quanto à alimentação e sono. O objetivo, aqui, foi acompanhar longitudinalmente uma família, analisando os pressupostos e práticas sociais manifestados discursivamente, a respeito da gemelaridade, a partir do diagnóstico da gestação gemelar de crianças monozigóticas, considerando-se, em especial, o desenvolvimento da linguagem e o processo de constituição da identidade de tais crianças. MÉTODOS: O trabalho pauta-se na abordagem naturalista/observacional, perspectiva histórico-cultural e no paradigma de natureza indiciária. Considerou-se os dados de oito entrevistas, vídeo-gravadas a cada três meses, a partir do diagnóstico da gestação gemelar monozigótica com uma família. Os dados foram analisados, considerando-se: a descoberta, escolha de nomes, vestuário, interação, rotina, linguagem e identidade. RESULTADOS: As categorias analisadas apareceram nos discursos coletados e revelaram a dificuldade {{familiar}} em assimilar a presença de gêmeos, que acabam sendo " dois vistos como um". CONCLUSÕES: Os aspectos sociais envolvidos frente à semelhança são marcantes o suficiente para vencer a possibilidade de alteração no processo de desenvolvimento da linguagem e identidade dessas crianças. A Fonoaudiologia precisa incorporar à prática clínica, o acolhimento dessas famílias, com suas crenças e valores, para que as intervenções fonoaudiológicas, junto a essa população, sejam efetivas. PURPOSE: Families with {{monozygotic twin}} children have some typical practices which begin in early pregnancy and persist during the childhood, including {{wearing the same}} clothes and colors, choosing phonetically similar names and offering the same food and sleeping patterns. The {{purpose of this study}} was to follow-up, prospectively, one family with identical twins, analyzing the influence of assumptions and social practices expressed in their discourse on the language development and the construction process of each child's identity, from the diagnosis of <b>monozygotic</b> twin <b>pregnancy.</b> METHODS: The study is based on the naturalist/observational approach, the historic-cultural perspective and the indiciary paradigm. Eight interviews were video recorded every three months since the diagnosis of identical twin pregnancy in one family, and information regarding the following categories were analyzed: the announcement of pregnancy, choice of names, clothes, family interaction, general routine, language and identity of each child. RESULTS: All analyzed categories were referred by the family during the interviews, and revealed their difficulty in assimilating the presence of two different children, who end up being seen as one child. CONCLUSION: The social aspects that come along with the similarities of monozygotic twins are remarkable enough to overcome and change its influence on these children's processes of language and identity development. The Speech-Language Pathology has an important role to support these families in the context of their beliefs and values, so that the intervention, when necessary, is effective...|$|R
