Field experiments conducted during 2002 and 2003 to evaluate the fact of row spacing and <b>Mepiquat</b> chloride application on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) var. MNH- 700. Four rates of <b>Mepiquat</b> chloride (4 x 123, 2 x 246, 4 x 246 and 4 x 370 mL ha 1) and a check with 0 mL ha 1 were evaluated for cotton growing in 25, 50 and 75 cm row spacing in 2002 and 2003. Plant height and number of total main stem nodes were different among row spacing and <b>Mepiquat</b> chloride application. The height was highest in plots where no application of <b>Mepiquat</b> chloride. Cotton grown in narrow row spacing (20 and 50 cm) had higher seed cotton yield than 75 cm row spacing, but reduce Ginning Out Turn (GOT) percentage in narrow row spacing negating any increase in seed cotton yield. In general reduced row spacing and <b>Mepiquat</b> chloride application did not lower fiber quality. In some cases, micronair was reduced in narrow row spacing (0. 1), but values were in acceptable range for fiber traits. <b>Mepiquat</b> chloride is considered a desirable management tool to control crop growth. Ultra-narrow row spacing should practices only in the areas where plant growth is not accurate or upto the standard.

Increasing drought resistance of cotton seedlings by accelerating root growth is an important practical implication. The study was conducted on effects of <b>mepiquat</b> chloride (1, 1 -dimetheyl peperidinum chloride) on drought resistance of cotton seedling. The cotton seeds were soaked for night in mepequat chloride solution i. e. 0, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 ml L - 1. Water stress was given after thirty days after sowing, for nine days and data were collected for root length, shoot length, fresh weight and dry weight. Firstly, <b>mepiquat</b> chloride seed treated plants were well irrigated and subjected to severe stress. It indicated that petiol length and shoot length decreased, while root length, fresh weight and dry weight increased with high concentration of <b>mepiquat</b> chloride.

In order to accommodate the intended uses of <b>mepiquat,</b> United Kingdom proposed to raise the existing MRLs from the limit of quantification to 0. 1 mg/kg for meat (except poultry meat), to 0. 5 mg/kg for liver (except poultry liver), to 0. 8 mg/kg for kidney and offal (except poultry kidney and offal), and from 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg for oats and wheat. United Kingdom drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. EFSA considers that the submitted supervised residue trials are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 3 mg/kg for the proposed uses on wheat (existing and new residue definition); for oats the MRL {{does not have to}} be modified for the existing residue definition, but needs to be raised to 3 mg/kg for the new residue definition.
