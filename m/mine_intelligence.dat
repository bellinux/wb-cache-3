40|$|Architectural <b>mining</b> <b>intelligence</b> operations, {{which are}} {{knowledge}} gathering procedures. These intelligence operations go beyond basic data collection (assembling uncorrelated information) {{to the point}} of collecting fully assimilated practical knowledge – knowledge that affects important architectural decisions. Gathering knowledge is an essential element of being a software architect. Ordinary knowledge gathering for a project requires the capture of end user requirements and perhaps the evaluation of some commercial product. Proper architectural practices go well beyond these project centric traditions, which are isolationist when used exclusively. Instead, these practices should be augmented with some additional procedures that {{have been found to be}} effective, including architectural mining, architectural iteration, and architectural judgment.

40|$|Automatically {{detecting}} {{conflicting information}} in text {{and more specifically}} detecting conflicting information between individual sentences has many applications, for instance, in opinion <b>mining,</b> in <b>mining</b> <b>intelligence</b> reports, in identifying details in descriptions of biomedical experiments, in finding contradictions in the reporting of news channels, etc. Strictly speaking sentences A and B are contradictory {{if there is no}} possible world in which A and B are both true. However, for contradiction detection to be useful a looser definition, which more closely matches human intuition, is common: A contradiction occurs when two sentences are extremely unlikely to be true simultaneously. Goals Given a corpus with contradictory and non-contradictory sentences, the aim is to design and test several feature extraction (e. g., capturing negation, antonymy, numeric information, etc.) and word alignment techniques. Methods A study is made on how contradictions are expressed in text. A classifier can then be learned that detects pair-wise contradictions in a sentence set. Requirements and practicalities The student is interested in natural language understanding and has good analytical skills. A basic knowledge of a programming language is needed. The research group provides a number of essential tools for text processing and analysis.
