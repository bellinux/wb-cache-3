The evident success of using <b>manipulatives</b> in improving student's understanding of fractions was apparent based on improved scores on a posttest. Most students benefitted from {{the use of}} both types ofmanipulatives, whether they were manual or virtual. Therefore, both virtual and manual <b>manipulatives</b> were found to support student learning of concepts related to addition of fractions. Based on a survey and teacher observations, students were found to have positive attitudes towards the use of both <b>manipulatives</b> as well. Particular attention was paid to the use of virtual <b>manipulatives</b> in the study due to the newness of this resource. Virtual <b>manipulatives</b> were found to support the learning of fractions by aiding in the visual representation and because the technology enabled students to concentrate on the conceptual knowledge and not computation.

30|$|Digital <b>manipulatives</b> {{can allow}} {{students}} to make the connection between concrete objects and more abstract objects {{to gain a better}} symbolic, conceptual understanding of the mathematical concept. A challenge of the concreteness and perceptual richness of some physical <b>manipulatives,</b> however, is that it makes it difficult to transfer knowledge and generalize to other contexts. Students may not recognize, for example, that a circle with one fifth shaded, the decimal representation of 0.2, and the fraction representation 1 / 5 all represent the same mathematical value. It is possible that physical, concrete <b>manipulatives</b> are better to learn with at the beginning, but that digital <b>manipulatives</b> are better for transferability. So, if learners can transition from concrete to digital, they may get the benefit of both. As a scaffolding technique, younger students can start with concrete <b>manipulatives</b> before using digital ones. Our later case illustration in this <b>manipulatives</b> section illustrates one way this could be approached.|$|R

Throughout history, different types of <b>manipulatives</b> {{have been used to}} aid in comprehension of mathematical concepts including quipu, abaci and pattern blocks. Today, concrete and virtual <b>manipulatives</b> are the tools that early childhood teachers are using in their mathematics classrooms across the country to instruct young learners. The concrete experience that these objects provide allows children to have a greater understanding of mathematical concepts which becomes the basis of their conceptual mathematical knowledge. Teachers who effectively implement concrete and virtual <b>manipulatives</b> create a mathematically rich environment in which young learners are able to examine ideas critically and solve problems. The use of these <b>manipulatives</b> fosters the beginning of life-long mathematical learning in inquisitive young learners. Use of <b>manipulatives</b> in classrooms significantly helps young learners to build strong mathematical foundations.

30|$|<b>Manipulatives</b> are {{objects that}} {{students}} interact with to learn, and these objects could be concrete or digital {{as long as}} students can slide, flip, and turn the visual representation {{as if it were}} a real three-dimensional object (Moyer, Bolyard, & Spikell, 2002). Several complementary theoretical assumptions provide insight as to how <b>manipulatives</b> impact learning. First is the thought that <b>manipulatives</b> support the development of abstract reasoning for younger children who have greater dependency on physically interacting with their environment to extract meaning (Montessori, 1964; Piaget, 1962). Those who are too young, however, may struggle with the concept that an object can stand for an item while simultaneously representing a mathematical concept (Uttal, O’Doherty, Newland, Hand, & DeLoache, 2009). Supporting this notion, a recent meta-analysis showed that children ages 7 – 11 years benefitted most from concrete <b>manipulatives</b> whereas ages 3 – 6 years found little benefits from using <b>manipulatives.</b> Concrete <b>manipulatives</b> have also been found to be less beneficial for older students, a finding that can be partly explained by their increased ability to reason abstractly (Carbonneau et al., 2013).|$|R
