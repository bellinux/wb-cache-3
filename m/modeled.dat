40|$|To {{validate}} {{an estimated}} <b>model</b> {{and to have}} a good understanding of its reliability is a central aspect of System Identification. This contribution discusses these aspects in the light of <b>model</b> error <b>models</b> that are explicit descriptions of the <b>model</b> error. A <b>model</b> error <b>model</b> is implicitly present in most <b>model</b> validation methods, so the concept is more of a representation form than a set of new techniques. Traditional <b>model</b> validation is essentially a test of whether the confidence region of the <b>model</b> error <b>model</b> contains the zero <b>model.</b> However, the <b>model</b> error <b>model</b> allows a better visualization of the possible deficiencies of the nominal <b>model.</b> Based on such information, the nominal <b>model</b> may very well be accepted even if the <b>model</b> error <b>model</b> does not contain the zero <b>model.</b> Conversely, it will be illustrated that the <b>model</b> error <b>model</b> may give good reason - because of if its more precise infomation - to reject a nominal <b>model,</b> that has passed a conventional <b>model</b> validation test...|$|R

5|$|Jeff Tolbert also {{accepts the}} Slender Man as folkloric and {{suggests}} {{it represents a}} process he calls “reverse ostension.” Ostension in folkloristics {{is the process of}} acting out a folk narrative. According to Tolbert, the Slender Man does the opposite by creating a set of folklore-like narratives where none existed before. It is an iconic figure produced through a collective effort and deliberately <b>modeled</b> after an existing and familiar folklore genre. According to Tolbert, this represents two processes in one: it involves the creation of new objects and new disconnected examples of experience, and it involves the combination of these elements into a body of “traditional” narratives, <b>modeled</b> on existing folklore (but not wholly indebted to any specific tradition).|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the notions}} of viewpoints, <b>models</b> and {{channeling}} constraints, the paper introduces <b>model</b> induction, a systematic transformation of constraints in an existing <b>model</b> to constraints in another viewpoint. Meant to be a general CSP <b>model</b> operator, <b>model</b> induction is useful in generating redundant <b>models,</b> which can be further induced or combined with the original <b>model</b> or mutually redundant <b>models.</b> We propose three ways of combining redundant <b>models</b> using <b>model</b> induction, <b>model</b> channeling, and <b>model</b> intersection. Experimental results on the Langford's problem confirm that our proposed combined <b>models</b> exhibit improvements in efficiency and robustness over the original single <b>models...</b>|$|R
