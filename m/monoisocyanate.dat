40|$|Diisocyanates {{are very}} {{reactive}} {{low molecular weight}} chemicals that are widely used {{in the manufacture of}} polyurethane products. Diisocyanate exposure {{is one of the most}} commonly reported causes of occupational asthma. Although diisocyanates have been identified as causative agents of respiratory diseases, the specific mechanisms by which these diseases occur remain largely unknown. Tandem mass spectrometry was used to unambiguously identify the binding site of isocyanates within four model peptides (Leu-enkephalin (Leu-enk, YGGFL), Angiotensin I (DRVYIHPFHL), Substance P-amide (RPKPQQFFGLM-NH 2), and Fibronectin-adhesion promoting peptide (FAPP, WQPPRARI)). In each case, isocyanates were observed to react to the N-terminus of the peptide. No evidence of side chain/isocyanate adduct formation exclusive of the N-terminus was observed. However, significant intra-molecular diisocyanate crosslinking between the N-terminal amine and a side chain amine group was observed for arginine, when located within two residues of the N-terminus. Addition of multiple isocyanates to the peptide occurs via polymerization at the N-terminus, rather than addition of multiple isocyanate molecules to varied residues within the peptide. Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) -specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with potential use in immunoassays for exposure and biomarker assessments were produced. A total of 59 unique mAbs were produced (29 IgG 1, 14 IgG 2 a, 4 IgG 2 b, 2 IgG 3 and 10 IgM) against 2, 4 and 2, 6 TDI bound protein. The reactivities of these mAbs were characterized by a solid phase indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Dot ELISA and Western immunoblot against various <b>monoisocyanate,</b> diisocyanate and dithioisocyanate protein conjugates. A subset of the mAbs were specific for 2, 4 or 2, 6 TDI-conjugated proteins only while others reacted to multiple dNCO conjugates including methylene diphenyl diisocyanate- and hexamethelene diisocyanate- human serum albumin. Western blot analyses demonstrated that some TDI conjugates form inter- and intra-molecular links resulting in multimers and a change in the electrophoretic mobility of the conjugate. In general, 2, 4 / 2, 6 TDI reactive mAbs displayed (1) stronger recognition of <b>monoisocyanate</b> haptenated proteins when the isocyanate was in the ortho position relative to the tolyl group, and were able to discriminate between (2) isocyanate and isothiocyanate conjugates (i. e. between the urea and thiourea linkage); and (3) between aromatic and aliphatic diisocyanates. The mAbs produced were not carrier protein specific with estimated affinity constants toward toluene diisocyanate conjugated human serum albumin ranging from 2. 21 x 107 to 1. 07 x 1010 M- 1 for IgG mAbs. Studies using TDI vapor exposed lung and epithelial cell lines suggest potential utility of these mAbs for both research and biomonitoring of isocyanate exposure...|$|E
40|$|Laser and Fourier {{transform}} spectroscopy {{were used}} to study a variety of gas phase molecules. A series of calcium and strontium monoalkoxides, CaOR and SrOR [R=H, CH₃, CH₂CH₃, CH(CH₃) ₂, CH₂CH₂CH₃, CH₂(CH₂) ₂CH₃, CH₂(CH₃) CH₂CH₃ and C(CH₃) ₃] was studied by laser induced fluorescence and laser excitation techniques. The A - X and B - X electronic transitions were recorded. Calcium and strontium monocyclopentadienide, CaCp and SrCp, were produced in a Broida oven and the spectra were recorded at low resolution by laser techniques. The geometry of these molecules is like an "open-faced sandwich", with C₅ᵥ symmetry. The A²Π - X²Σ⁺ and B²Σ⁺ - X²Σ⁺ transitions of calcium and strontium <b>monoisocyanate,</b> CaNCO and SrNCO, were recorded for the first time. The spectra are interpreted as arising from a molecule with linear, ionic Sr⁺ - ⁻NCO structure. The 0 - 0 band of the A - X transition of SrNCO was recorded at high resolution and rotationally analyzed. The use of a 0. 64 m monochromator, acting as a narrow bandpass filter, was necessary for recording the spectra and enabled the correct assignment of the rotational lines. By comparing the molecular constants of SrNCO with related molecules, the NCO⁻ ligand {{was found to be}} nitrogen bonding to the strontium atom. The Sr-N bond length was estimated to be 2. 26 A in the ground state. The rotational analysis of the 0 - 0 band of the A²E₁/₂ - X²A₁ transition of the SrOCH₃ free radical has been carried out by laser excitation spectroscopy. The SrOCH₃ molecule was found to have C₃ᵥ symmetry with a Sr-O bond length of 2. 12 A. There was no evidence of a Jahn-Teller effect in the A²E state. This work is the first high-resolution analysis of a metal alkoxide molecule. The rotationally cool (30 K) spectrum of the 0 - 0 vibrational band of the A²Δ - X²Π electronic transition for the diatomic free radical CCl was recorded using a Fourier transform spectrometer. The first rotational lines of the six strongest branches were observed, and transitions in three other branches were also detected. The CCl radical was produced in a corona-excited supersonic expansion source...|$|E

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{isocyanate}} sampler {{has been used to}} investigate aging aerosols generated during thermal degradation of polyurethane (PUR). The sampler consists of a denuder connected in series with a three-stage cascade impactor and a filter. The denuder collects gas-phase isocya-nates. The three impactor stages had cut-off diameters (d 50) of 2. 5, 1. 0 and 0. 5 mm, respectively. The end filter collects particles < 0. 5 mm. For derivatization of isocyanates in the sampler, di-n-butylamine mixed with an equimolar amount of acetic acid was used for impregnation of the sampler stages. Consecutive sampling using three denuder–impactor samplers was performed in a test chamber, with a total sampling time of 9 min. Analysis of air samples was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) /MS. Particle size measurements were performed using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). A time-dependent behavior was observed for aromatic diisocyanates during aging of the aerosol. Thermal degradation of different PUR materials showed different distribution of isocyanates between gas and par-ticles. Aromatic diisocyanates (toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and methylene diphenyl diisocya-nate) were initially in gas phase and associated to very small particles. After a few minutes most of these isocyanates were associated with particles < 1 mm. <b>Monoisocyanates</b> and hexam-ethylene diisocyanate (HDI) were not found to be associated with particles...|$|R
40|$|Emissions from a {{chemical}} core binder system (Hot Box) {{based on a}} formaldehyde–carbamide resin have been investigated. The binder is used in some Swedish die-casting foundries. During core-making and casting, low molecular <b>monoisocyanates,</b> in particular methyl isocyanate (MIC) and isocyanic acid (ICA), were identified. Exposure to air concentrations of MIC, ICA and formaldehyde were subsequently determined in all Swedish foundries using the Hot Box binder, and involved three brass and one grey iron foundry. The survey {{was carried out in}} the winter period of 2001, and involved core-makers, casters and fettlers in the brass foundries, whereas only core-makers were included in the grey iron foundry. For each worker, four to five short-term samples of isocyanates (n = 298) and one 8 h sample of formaldehyde (n = 64) were collected during one shift for 15 die-casters, 39 core-makers and 10 other workers in the foundry. The air concentrations of the MIC short-term samples varied between < 4 and 68 mg m 3, with corresponding ICA levels between < 4 and 280 mg m 3. Calculated 8 h time weighted average air concentrations of MIC, based on short-term samples for each indi-vidual, varied between < 4 and 31 mg m 3; for ICA the corresponding levels varied from < 4 to 190 mg m 3. The formaldehyde time weighted average concentration levels ranged from 14 t...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the emissions of powerful asthmatic agents called isocyanates from small-scale pyrolysis experiments of two common foams employed in mattress production such as flexible polyurethane foam (FPUF) and viscoelastic memory foam (VMF). A nitrogen atmosphere and five different temperatures, 300, 350, 400, 450 and 850 °C, were selected {{to carry out the}} experiments in order to evaluate the worst possible conditions for thermal degradation. A similar trend for both materials was found. At lower temperatures, diisocyanates were the most important products whereas at 850 °C <b>monoisocyanates,</b> and mainly isocyanic acid released mainly from the thermal cracking of diisocyanates evolved directly from the polymer chains. The total yields of isocyanates were in the range of 1. 43 – 11. 95 mg/m 3 for FPUF at 300 - 850 °C and 0. 05 – 6. 13 mg/m 3 for VMF, 300 - 850 °C. This difference could be a consequence of the lower amount of isocyanates employed in the VMF production which was confirmed by the nitrogen content of the foams, 5. 95 % FPUF vs. 3. 34 % in VMF. Additionally, a qualitative search for so far unknown isocyanates was performed in samples from the pyrolysis of FPUF at 300, 400 and 850 °C. It was confirmed that six different aminoisocyanates at 300 °C were evolved, whereas at 400 and 850 °C only five of them were detected. The general trend observed was a decrease of the aminoisocyanate levels with increasing pyrolysis temperature.
