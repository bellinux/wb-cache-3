25|$|Seven {{crew members}} and a pilot from Hanko {{lost their lives}} in the accident. Due to the {{extensive}} damage suffered by the pusher only two bodies were found and recovered during the initial dives into the capsized vessel in early January — the first engineer was found in the crushed office and the chief steward in the staircase. After the combination had been rightened on 1 February, the purser was found in the shower room of his own cabin and the electrician in a spare cabin next to the mess hall. When the detached parts of the superstructure were recovered for official investigation in late February, the body of the first mate was found in the remains of the <b>machinery</b> <b>room</b> located below the bridge. The search for the missing victims continued until July 1991 mainly by the Finnish Navy and a tourist submarine chartered to the investigation board. The bodies of the captain and the pilot, who were at the bridge when Finn-Baltic capsized, were found along the drifting path in May and June, respectively. The body of the deck repair man was never recovered.|$|E

500|$|The sixth, {{ninth and}} thirteenth salvos were {{straddles}} and two decisive hits {{were made on}} Bismarck. One shell holed her bow and caused Bismarck to lose 1,000 tons of fuel oil, mostly to salt-water contamination. The other fell short, and entered Bismarck below her side armour belt, the shell exploded and flooded the auxiliary boiler <b>machinery</b> <b>room</b> and forced the shutdown of two boilers due to a slow leak in the boiler room immediately aft.

5000|$|The main <b>machinery</b> <b>room</b> {{measures}} 55 ft long by 78 ft {{wide and}} 32 ft high.

The steam plant is a relatively standard steam plant in its general characteristics, with a nine-stage high-pressure turbine and a 7-stage low-pressure turbine driving a single propeller shaft. The turbines were specially adapted to use the saturated steam typically provided by a nuclear power source. It was also unusual in having a 750 hp electric motor geared to the high-pressure turbine for use in an emergency. The motor was driven by either the ship's steam turbogenerators or the 750 KW emergency diesel generators located {{in the rear of}} the pilothouse. These generators could provide basic propulsion to the motor while running the reactor coolant pumps. The motor was upgraded to provide greater torque and reversibility to allow it to move the ship away from a pier in the event of a reactor accident.|$|E
50|$|The gun {{was mounted}} en barbette on a wrought-iron sliding {{carriage}} and gun fired {{over the top}} of the parapet of the emplacement. This enabled the gun-crew to handle and fire the gun without exposing themselves to enemy fire. The battery was designed to engage enemy warships at ranges up to 7,000 yards.

2500|$|The Leningrads {{had three}} shafts, which necessitated {{laying out the}} boilers and {{machinery}} on the [...] "unit" [...] principle which had the advantage that one hit couldn't disable all of the boilers or engines and immobilize the ship. Two boiler rooms, each with one triple drum, water-tube boiler, were sited beneath the forward funnel. Immediately aft of them were two <b>machinery</b> <b>rooms,</b> each with one [...] geared steam turbine for the two flank shafts. The third boiler room was near the rear funnel and its turbine room was just aft, powering the central shaft.|$|R
50|$|Thus, in the 1930s, the plant’s {{boiler room}} {{included}} eleven low pressure boilers: ten Babcock & Wilcox and one Humboldt. The <b>machinery</b> <b>room</b> comprised five generating sets of varying outputs and brands: Escher & Wiss, AEG (two sets), Stal-Asea and Escher Wiss/Thompson.|$|E
50|$|The low {{pressure}} naves began construction in 1914 and were completed in 1930, going through three very important construction phases. The first (from 1914 to 1921) included construction of two industrial naves for the boilers, the <b>machinery</b> <b>room</b> for the alternators {{and for the}} substation.The second phase (from 1924 to 1928) included the first expansion of the boiler room with a new longitudinal nave, {{the purchase of a}} new generating set, construction of a coal distributor and the docks to the refrigeration circuit’s channels.Finally, it was in the third phase (from 1928 to 1930) that the final expansion was carried out on the boiler room-with a new industrial nave of greater proportions than the previous ones-the <b>machinery</b> <b>room</b> and the substation.|$|E

In order to do so the boilers were positioned directly above the turbines in the same arrangement to have been used in the 1916 s. The boilers were then rearranged several times so they were staggered with the turbines, eventually ending directly alongside the turbines. The propulsion system was arranged as close together as possible, and the evaporators and distilling equipment were placed in the <b>machinery</b> <b>rooms.</b> This provided enough additional space behind the armored belt to add a second plotting room.|$|R
