40|$|This is {{a report}} of the {{investigation}} of the High-Speed 7 - X 10 -Foot Wind Tunnel at NASA Langley Research Center, which experienced a catastrophic failure of all 18 Sitka spruce fan blades during operation at 0. 8 Mach number on 2 July 1985. The High-Speed Tunnel, a closed-circuit/single-return atmospheric wind tunnel, had been operated since 1945 to support a wide range of subsonic aerodynamic tests and studies. The failed blade set had been in use since 1975. In addition to blade loss, the most significant damage was a bent main drive shaft for a total estimated damage loss of 1. 7 million dollars. An analysis of the natural frequency characteristics as well as loads, reactions, stresses, and deflections of the fan drive system resulting from steady-state and dynamic loads due to unbalance was performed. Transient load cases were simulated by step input and ramp input loading functions intended to simulate the loss of one to nine blades (<b>maximum</b> <b>unbalance</b> forces) ...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{environmental}} concerns related to climate change, fiscal incentives from governments around the world, and falling prices of proved and ever-improving technology, {{the use of}} renewable energy sources has been rising considerably over the past years. A considerable amount of these sources, among which solar is to be highlighted, is used by gridconnected generators that are installed in electrical distribution systems. Solar photovoltaic generators are characterised for using an intermittent source of energy. Since {{they do not have}} any moving parts and therefore no inertia, variations in irradiance levels directly and instantaneously affect output power. Therefore, fluctuations in generated power from PV systems result in unbalancing between consumption and generation. In such context, this project aims to study the impact of high PV systems penetration in voltage and unbalance levels of electrical distribution feeders, such as percentages of unbalance and rise in pu voltage that can be expected under a certain penetration level of distributed PV generation, feeder sensitivity to photovoltaic penetration, times of the day when <b>maximum</b> <b>unbalance</b> can be expected… among others. After a literature review that defines power quality issues and the power-flow analysis method, the methodology for the analysis is presented. Two software tools, OpenDSS and MATLAB, have been integrated to program the code that is necessary to run the simulations that will provide the necessary results. The general characteristics of the resulting code are reviewed. Three types of analysis have been implemented: 1. Snapshot analyses, which provide the state of the system under certain loading conditions; 2. Feeder sensitivity to PV penetration analyses, which calculate the highest unbalance that occurs in the feeder under increasing PV penetration conditions; and 3. Time-series simulations, which use time-series solar irradiance and load data drawn from real sources to simulate realistic situations. These analyses have been performed on two very different feeders: on a smaller, 37 -Bus delta-connected distribution feeder from IEEE, and on a bigger, 2998 -Bus wye-connected distribution feeder from EPRI. The results of these simulations and the conclusions regarding the main objectives are then presented...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 67) This thesis {{contains a}} description of the design and assembly of a low loss coaxial balun that operates over more than a 4 : 1 band width ratio and studies the parameters that limit the bandwidth and increase the insertion loss. The design {{is similar to that of}} Phelan, but incorporates an input transformer to obtain a 1 : 1 impedance-ratio. This low loss, lightweight balun met certain physical and electrical requirements in order to be incorporated into an existing system. A develop mental model balun was fabricated and tested. Electrical data and photographs of the balun are included. The final test results verify that the design requirements were met. The balun has an operating bandwidth ratio of 4. 37 : 1 with 0. 59 dB insertion loss. The phase difference is less than 3 degrees from the ideal phase relationship of 180 degrees between output ports. The <b>maximum</b> power <b>unbalance</b> between output ports is 0. 5 dB. This balun design is well suited to efficiently feed broadband radiating dipole antennas...|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of a three-phase induction motor from a single-phase supply with a capacitor in circuit is well known. While detailed investigations {{on the performance of}} the induction motor under such operating conditions are well reported in the literature, no such work is reported for the synchronous motor. The fine-start permanent-magnet synchronous motor (LSPMSM) is actively being considered as an energy efficient alternative to the induction motor in general purpose, heavy duty applications. The paper presents an analytical and experimental evaluation on the performance of a three-phase LSPMSM fed from a single-phase supply. This analysis is carried out using symmetrical component theory. A capacitor is connected across two stator phases during starting and running. Estimation of the capacitor value to achieve the desired objectives, such as minimum <b>unbalance,</b> <b>maximum</b> power factor, maximum torque or maximum efficiency, is carried out. Load tests are conducted to validate the simulation results...|$|R
40|$|Low voltage (LV) feeder voltage {{magnitude}} and unbalance {{are often the}} constraining factors on a feeder's capacity to absorb rooftop photovoltaic (PV) generation. This paper presents a new probabilistic method for voltage management in distribution networks through the placement of distribution static compensators (dSTATCOM) and on-load tap changers (OLTC) considering the reactive capability of PV inverters in multiple LV and medium volt-age distribution networks. The method uses a modified particle swarm optimization. In this paper, several scenarios for the place-ments of multiple dSTATCOMs with and without embedded energy storage systems using both reactive and real power compensation are investigated in combination with an OLTC equipped with independent per-phase tap-changing control. The voltage constraints in the proposed method are statistically defined using three duration curves. These are the voltage <b>unbalance,</b> <b>maximum</b> voltage and minimum voltage duration curves. The method is comprehensively tested for varying load and PV generation {{based on data from}} a real Australian distribution network with considerable unbalance and distributed PV generation. The results show that PV hosting capacity increases where the proposed approach is applied...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest in developing rotating machinery shaft crack-detection methodologies and online techniques. Shaft crack problems present a significant safety and loss hazard in nearly every application of modern turbomachinery. In many cases, the rotors of modern machines are rapidly accelerated from rest to operating speed, to reduce the excessive vibrations at the critical speeds. The vibration monitoring during startup or shutdown has been receiving growing attention (ref. 1), especially for machines such as aircraft engines, which are subjected to frequent starts and stops, as well as high speeds and acceleration rates. It has been recognized that the presence of angular acceleration strongly affects the rotor's <b>maximum</b> response to <b>unbalance</b> and the speed at which it occurs. Unfortunately, conventional nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods have unacceptable limits in terms of their application for online crack detection. Some of these techniques are time consuming and inconvenient for turbomachinery service testing. Almost all of these techniques require that the vicinity of the damage be known in advance, and they can provide only local information, with no indication of the structural strength at a component or system level. In addition, the effectiveness of these experimental techniques is affected by the high measurement noise levels existing in complex turbomachine structures. Therefore, the use of vibration monitoring along with vibration analysis has been receiving increasing attention...|$|R
