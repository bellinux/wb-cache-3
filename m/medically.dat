5|$|A {{weak and}} {{emaciated}} Tolkien spent {{the remainder of}} the war alternating between hospitals and garrison duties, being deemed <b>medically</b> unfit for general service.|$|E
5|$|Physiology is {{the study}} the {{interaction}} of how, for example, the nervous, immune, endocrine, respiratory, and circulatory systems, function and interact. The study of these systems is shared with such <b>medically</b> oriented disciplines as neurology and immunology.|$|E
5|$|Adderall {{has been}} {{banned in the}} National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association (NBA), and the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA). In leagues such as the NFL, {{there is a very}} {{rigorous}} process required to obtain an exemption to this rule even when the athlete has been <b>medically</b> prescribed the drug by their physician.|$|E
5|$|As in Britain, some Southern Rhodesian women {{during the}} war {{presented}} men not wearing military uniform with white feathers (symbolising cowardice). This campaign often went awry, {{as many of the}} men presented with the feathers were not in fact shirking from service. In 1916, hoping to save them further harassment, the Rhodesia Herald and other newspapers began publishing lists of men who had volunteered only to be deemed <b>medically</b> unfit by the army doctors.|$|E
5|$|Assisted {{suicide and}} abortion: Viewing all human life as sacred, the Assemblies of God opposes {{assisted}} suicide and abortion (unless it is <b>medically</b> {{confirmed that the}} mother's life is in imminent, physical danger). It believes scripture is silent {{on the use of}} contraception and therefore takes no position on this subject.|$|E
5|$|Collins was {{originally}} {{slated to be}} the Command Module Pilot (CMP) on Apollo 8 but was removed when he required surgery {{on his back and}} was replaced by Jim Lovell, his backup for that flight. After Collins was <b>medically</b> cleared, he took what would have been Lovell's spot on Apollo 11; as a veteran of Apollo 8, Lovell was transferred to Apollo 11's backup crew and promoted to backup commander.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{veterans}} who provide evidence meeting VA requirements for service in Vietnam, {{and who can}} <b>medically</b> establish that anytime after this 'presumptive exposure' they developed any medical problems {{on the list of}} presumptive diseases, may receive compensation from the VA. Certain {{veterans who}} served in Korea and are able to prove they were assigned to certain specified around the DMZ during a specific time frame are afforded similar presumption.|$|E
5|$|Early {{into his}} fifth season, Yao was injured again, this time {{breaking}} {{his right knee}} on December 23, 2006, while attempting to block a shot. Up to that point he had been averaging 26.8points, 9.7rebounds and 2.3blocks per game, and had been mentioned as an MVP candidate. Yao was unable to play in {{what would have been}} his fifth All-Star game; he was <b>medically</b> cleared to play on March 4, 2007, after missing 32games.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after two}} operations, Bure {{did not play}} in 2003–04 due to the {{lingering}} effects of the knee injury. He failed a pre-season physical and was declared <b>medically</b> unable to play. Left with his fully insured $10million salary (80 percent {{of which would be}} reimbursed to the team), the Rangers left him unprotected in the NHL's Waiver Draft, where he was unclaimed.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, Schumacher {{suffered}} a {{traumatic brain injury}} in a skiing accident. He {{was placed in a}} <b>medically</b> induced coma for six months until 16 June 2014. He left the hospital in Grenoble for further rehabilitation at the University Hospital of Lausanne. On 9 September 2014, Schumacher was relocated to his home where he continues to receive medical treatment and rehabilitation privately.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1918 Hines was {{discharged}} from the AIF as being <b>medically</b> unfit due to hemorrhoid problems. He arrived back in Australia on 19October 1918. While his Army service file records that he was lightly wounded on two occasions, Hines later {{claimed to have been}} wounded five times.|$|E
5|$|Mycotoxins are {{secondary}} metabolites (or natural products), {{and research}} has established {{the existence of}} biochemical pathways solely {{for the purpose of}} producing mycotoxins and other natural products in fungi. Mycotoxins may provide fitness benefits in terms of physiological adaptation, competition with other microbes and fungi, and protection from consumption (fungivory). Many fungal secondary metabolites (or derivatives) are used <b>medically,</b> as described under Human Use below.|$|E
5|$|On March 1, 2014, the {{day after}} {{a game against the}} Saskatoon Blades, Bozon was {{admitted}} to Royal University Hospital in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, where he was diagnosed with Neisseria meningitis. He spent four weeks in hospital, some of it in a <b>medically</b> induced coma, before being released on March 28, 2014.|$|E
5|$|On {{recovering}} from his wounds, Newland attended an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 21 July, {{where he was}} decorated with his Victoria Cross by King George V. Later the same day, Newland boarded a ship to Australia. It arrived in Melbourne on 18 September, and Newland travelled to Tasmania. He was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force as <b>medically</b> unfit on 2 March 1918.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the 19th century, the scope of {{physiology}} expanded greatly, from a primarily <b>medically</b> oriented field to a wide-ranging investigation of the physical and chemical processes of life—including plants, animals, and even microorganisms in addition to man. Living things as machines became a dominant metaphor in biological (and social) thinking.|$|E
5|$|Paoli {{sold his}} {{properties}} in Italy and acquired {{a small country}} house in Spain. He stayed {{for a few months}} with his brother Carlos in the Philippines. Paoli was <b>medically</b> treating his vocal cords, and it was commented that his career was over, but he continued his singing exercises with his sister Amalia, who moved into his house in Spain.|$|E
5|$|Some obstetricians {{argue that}} not {{offering}} screening for Down syndrome is unethical. As it is a <b>medically</b> reasonable procedure, per informed consent, people {{should at least}} be given information about it. It will then be the woman's choice, based on her personal beliefs, how much or how little screening she wishes. When results from testing become available, it is also considered unethical not to give the results to the person in question.|$|E
5|$|Soon after in 2004, Favre's wife, Deanna Favre, was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer. Following aggressive treatment through 2004, she recovered. She created The Deanna Favre Hope Foundation which supports breast cancer education and women's breast imaging and diagnosis services for all women, including those who are <b>medically</b> underserved.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} {{is difficult to}} treat, and may involve fillings, fluoride to fight tooth decay and drugs that increase saliva for dry mouth, as well as oral hygiene instruction. It can be <b>medically</b> dangerous for active methamphetamine users because of the cardiac problems that can result from the interaction of local anesthetic with the drug.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. In order to inherit it, {{both of the}} parents of an individual must carry an affected gene. Most have no family history of the condition. People with only one abnormal gene are called carriers (heterozygotes) and may have mild, but <b>medically</b> insignificant, abnormalities of copper metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Transferring to the Western Front in 1916, Newland was {{mentioned}} in despatches for his leadership while commanding a company during an attack at Mouquet Farm. He was wounded twice more {{during the war}} and <b>medically</b> discharged in March 1918; he returned to service with the permanent army. Newland held various appointments between the two world wars, and retired a lieutenant colonel in 1941. He died of heart failure in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis {{is closely}} linked to both {{overcrowding}} and malnutrition, {{making it one of}} the principal diseases of poverty. Those at high risk thus include: people who inject illicit drugs, inhabitants and employees of locales where vulnerable people gather (e.g. prisons and homeless shelters), <b>medically</b> underprivileged and resource-poor communities, high-risk ethnic minorities, children in close contact with high-risk category patients, and health-care providers serving these patients.|$|E
5|$|Unless {{a person}} has medical {{problems}} preventing movement, after a person starts anti-coagulation therapy bed rest {{should not be used}} to treat acute deep vein thrombosis. There are clinical benefits associated with walking and no evidence that walking is harmful, but people with DVT are harmed by bed rest except when it is <b>medically</b> necessary.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{activity}} occurs along a protein's active site. Traditional drug design methods involve tightly binding to {{this site}} and blocking its activity, {{under the assumption}} that the target protein exists in one rigid structure. However, this approach works for approximately only 15% of all proteins. Proteins contain allosteric sites which, when bound to by small molecules, can alter a protein's conformation and ultimately affect the protein's activity. These sites are attractive drug targets, but locating them is very computationally costly. In 2012, Folding@home and MSMs were used to identify allosteric sites in three <b>medically</b> relevant proteins: beta-lactamase, interleukin-2, and RNase H.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's long {{histories}} {{of cardiovascular disease}} and periodic need for urgent health care raised questions of whether he was <b>medically</b> fit to serve in public office. Having smoked approximately 3 packs of cigarettes per day for nearly 20 years, Cheney had his first of five heart attacks in 1978, at age 37. Subsequent attacks in 1984, 1988, 2000, and 2010 have resulted in moderate contractile dysfunction of his left ventricle. He underwent four-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting in 1988, coronary artery stenting in November 2000, urgent coronary balloon angioplasty in March 2001, and the implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in June, 2001.|$|E
5|$|Declared <b>medically</b> {{unfit for}} {{military}} service during World War I, Birkett used {{the time to make}} up for his late entry into the legal profession and was appointed a King's Counsel in 1924. He became a criminal defence lawyer and acted as counsel in a number of famous cases including the second of the Brighton trunk murders. A member of the Liberal Party, he sat in Parliament for Nottingham East twice, first in 1923 and again in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Giffords {{was taken}} to University Medical Center in {{critical}} condition, although she was still conscious. Within 38 minutes, Giffords underwent emergency surgery, and part of her skull was removed to prevent further brain damage caused by swelling. She was placed into a <b>medically</b> induced coma to allow her brain to rest. During a memorial ceremony on January 12, President Obama announced that earlier that day Giffords had opened her eyes {{for the first time}} since the attack.|$|E
5|$|In April 2014, the Kansas District Court {{granted a}} {{petition}} from Manning for a legal name change. An Army spokesman stated {{that while the}} Army would update personnel records to acknowledge the name change, the military would continue to regard Manning as a male. Manning sought hormone therapy {{and the right to}} live as a woman while confined, consistent with her gender dysphoria, which had been confirmed by two Army medical specialists. Such treatment is provided in civilian federal prisons when it is found to be <b>medically</b> necessary, but it is not available in military prisons. The Pentagon policy at the time considered transgender individuals ineligible to serve.|$|E
5|$|Moving to North Sydney in 1916, he {{established}} a real estate business and on 24 March 1917 entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly at the 1917 election, as the Nationalist Party candidate for the seat of Willoughby with 51.68%. A fervent Imperialist and pro-conscriptionist, he was rejected as <b>medically</b> unfit for the Australian Imperial Force in 1916 but eventually enlisted on 23 August 1918. Raising over £25,000 in War Loans, Weaver was discharged from the Army on 2 December 1918. When the Willoughby seat was abolished at the next election, Weaver contested the new multi-member electorate of North Shore, receiving 15.31% and the first seat on the electorate.|$|E
5|$|On the July 26, 2016, {{episode of}} SmackDown, a {{vignette}} aired promoting Benjamin's WWE return. However, on August 7, Benjamin announced that his return was on hiatus {{due to a}} torn rotator cuff, which required surgery. On March 30, 2017, Benjamin announced on Twitter that he was once again <b>medically</b> cleared to compete. However, he also confirmed that he never signed with WWE prior to his injury and was {{for the time being}} a free agent.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Cooma, Corey was {{employed}} as a contract rabbiter before moving to Canberra in 1922, where he {{was employed}} as a camp caretaker. On 23 September 1924, at St Gregory's Catholic Church, Queanbeyan, he married Sarah Jane Fisher; the pair later had a daughter, Patricia, before the marriage was dissolved in 1935. Between 1927 and 1940, Corey worked for the Department of the Interior as an office cleaner. He re-enlisted for service in the Second World War with the Australian Military Forces on 23 September 1941, and was posted to the 2nd Garrison Battalion {{for two years before}} he was <b>medically</b> discharged as a private on 11 October 1943.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{received}} {{no information about}} the massacre until the summer of 1943, when Pooley, who {{had spent the last}} three years in a German hospital due to the injuries he had suffered in the massacre, was declared <b>medically</b> unfit and repatriated. British authorities did not believe Pooley's story on his arrival; it was not thought that the German army were capable of such atrocities against British troops. Private O'Callaghan did not return to the United Kingdom until 1945 after the liberation of his prisoner-of-war camp. His confirmation of Pooley's story prompted an official investigation.|$|E
5|$|The Florida State University College of Medicine {{operates}} using diversified {{hospital and}} community-based clinical education medical training for medical students. Founded {{on the mission}} to provide care to <b>medically</b> under served populations, the Florida State University College of Medicine for patient-centered care. The students spend their first two years taking basic science courses on the FSU campus in Tallahassee and are then {{assigned to one of}} the regional medical school campuses for their third- and fourth-year clinical training. Rotations can be done at one of the six regional campuses in Daytona Beach, Fort Pierce, Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota or stay in Tallahassee if they so choose.|$|E
5|$|The Sanny and Jerry Ryan Center for Prevention and Genetics, {{housed in}} Choice Health & Fitness, {{encourages}} individuals {{to think about}} their health through preventive measures before it becomes <b>medically</b> necessary to seek care. The first {{of its kind in the}} region, the Center provides a unique opportunity for individuals to take an active approach to a healthier life. Truyu Aesthetic Center, with locations in Grand Forks, East Grand Forks and across the region, offers surgical and non-surgical procedures, services and products under the support of Altru. Altru Health System is the result of a 1997 merger of United Hospital (formerly Deaconess and St. Michael's Hospitals) and the Grand Forks Clinic.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} Ephraim Fabricant {{was named}} for real-life murderer Valery Fabrikant, a mechanical engineering professor who shot dead four of his colleagues in {{what became known as}} the Concordia University massacre. In addition, the character's back-story and demise were both intended to echo the case of Jack the Ripper—both were believed to be <b>medically</b> trained, while the use of Fabricant's kidney to send a message is based on the From Hell letter, sent to the police by the Ripper along with one of his victims' kidneys.|$|E
