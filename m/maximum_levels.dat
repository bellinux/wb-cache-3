50|$|Regardless of {{the kind}} of programme, there is usually a nominal Permitted <b>Maximum</b> <b>Level,</b> as {{indicated}} on a PPM. Operators are expected to keep levels below it, within reason. Practices vary between countries and organisations. In the UK, the Permitted <b>Maximum</b> <b>Level</b> is 8 dB above Alignment Level, corresponding to '6' on the British PPM scale. ITU-T standards for international sound programme circuits specify a Permitted <b>Maximum</b> <b>Level</b> of 9 dB above Alignment Level.

25|$|German dioxin incident: In January 2011 about 4700 German farms {{were banned}} from making {{deliveries}} after self-checking {{of an animal}} feed producer had showed levels of dioxin above <b>maximum</b> <b>levels.</b> This incident appeared to involve PCDDs and not PCBs. Dioxins were found in animal feed and eggs in many farms. The maximum values were exceeded twofold in feed and maximally fourfold in some individual eggs. Thus the incident was minor {{as compared with the}} Belgian crisis in 1999, and delivery bans were rapidly cleared.|$|E
25|$|The {{tradeoff}} {{comes in}} terms of power and accuracy; AA #2 is designed for small cases, and will burn inconsistently in the large 44 Magnum case. AA #9, however, will fill the case much better, and the slow burn rate of AA #9 is ideal for magnum handgun rounds, producing 20% higher velocities (at <b>maximum</b> <b>levels)</b> while still producing less pressure than the fast burning AA #2. A medium burning powder might actually be a better choice, as it could split the difference in powder weights while delivering more power and accuracy than the fastest powder.|$|E

An analysis of results since 1989, when disinfection of groundwater was first introduced, has shown a constant improvement {{in the quality of}} drinking water, with the percentage of violations decreasing from 8.4% in 1989 to 2.1% in 1999. In 2000, the Minister of Health signed an amended version of public health regulations which raise chemical standards for water quality to very stringent standards. <b>Maximum</b> <b>levels</b> for 38 new chemical substances—including pesticides, organic solvents and petroleum products—were set for the first time while existing standards for nitrates, lead, cadmium and zinc were tightened.|$|E
25|$|Biologist Arturo Massol and radiochemist Elba Díaz {{conducted}} an unpublished study in January 2001 that showed vegetables and plants {{growing in the}} civilian area of Vieques were highly contaminated with heavy metals such as lead, cadmium and copper. Furthermore, they discovered that metal concentrations in edible crops were both substantially above the <b>maximum</b> <b>levels</b> set by the European Union Council and much higher than plants tested in mainland Puerto Rico. Chiles, pasture grasses, and squashes were more effected than plants with deeper root systems such as trees. This {{is consistent with the}} theory that heavy metals travel by air to civilian areas via the steady easterly trade winds that blow directly from the bombing zone.|$|E
25|$|When Ronald Reagan {{was elected}} in 1982, he {{significantly}} reduced the size and cost of many portions of government, thereby greatly limiting the Civil Service Reform Act. Satisfying {{the need for new}} legislation, the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) was enacted on November 8, 1984. Most notably, the PMRS provided a greater level of evaluation accuracy and imposed minimum and <b>maximum</b> <b>levels</b> of pay increase to limit disparity among merit pay employees. PMRS also created Performance Standard Review Boards for each department and required that {{at least half of the}} board be members who were under the merit pay system. This requirement ensured that at least some board members had a vested interest in dealing with potential problems and concerns.|$|E

Nuclear fallout was dropped along the way, narrowly dispersed in {{a relatively small number}} of United States counties. Detected radioactivity was especially high in eight counties in Iowa and one county each in Nebraska, South Dakota and Illinois.

25|$|The Abruzzo {{region has}} {{two types of}} climate that are {{strongly}} influenced by the Apennine Mountains, dividing the climate of the coastal and sub-Apennine hills from the interior's high mountain ranges.

Often the Adriatic coast are sidelined rainfall from the west to the barrier effect of the Apennines undergoing the action of gentle winds descending from it (or Libeccio). The minimum annual rainfall, however, are found in some inland valleys, sheltered from much disturbance to the blocking action of mountain ridges, such as the Peligna Valley, or the valley of the river Tirino, which in some places (Ofena, Capestrano) showed barely , and not along the coast where it never falls below , for if Teramo is relatively little watered by rain (Teramo less than 800mm), the metre is exceeded in Chieti, reaching <b>maximum</b> <b>levels</b> in the Adriatic, while between Ortona and Vasto in Costa dei Trabocchi decrease again.|$|E
