25|$|I scored 114 in {{the first}} innings and 97 in the second. I will not claim that the first innings was a {{particularly}} good one, as it took <b>me</b> <b>almost</b> seven hours. But neither would I pretend {{that it was not}} immensely satisfying. I took ball after ball, blow after blow on that improvised body-shield but was able to stand firm...The second innings was the best I ever played. From the firm foundations of real confidence I was able to get after the bowling and repay Hall, particularly, for some of the anguish he had caused me. I had one glorious hour against him...I hooked him twice in a row and reduced him to the kind of despair which, but a fortnight earlier, had been exclusively mine.|$|E
500|$|September 2, 1942: For {{the first}} time, at 3:00 A.M. outside, {{attended}} a special action. Dante's Inferno seems to <b>me</b> <b>almost</b> a comedy compared to this. They don't call Auschwitz the camp of annihilation for nothing! ...|$|E
500|$|Monteverdi {{probably}} began composing in late October {{or early}} November 1607, since Rinuccini's arrival in Mantua can be dated to 23 October. With rehearsals due {{to begin in}} the new year, Monteverdi composed the work in a hurry and under considerable pressure; nearly 20 years later he was still complaining, {{in a letter to}} Striggio, of the hardships he had been made to suffer: [...] "It was the shortness of time that brought <b>me</b> <b>almost</b> to death's door in writing L'Arianna".|$|E

6000|$|Selah {{looked at}} him very {{steadily}} with her big eyes, and Herbert {{felt that he was}} quailing a little under their piercing, withering inquisition. By Jove, what a splendid woman she was, though, when she was angry! 'Herbert,' she said, rising from her chair and standing her full height imperiously before him, 'Herbert, you're deceiving <b>me.</b> I <b>almost</b> believe you're shilly-shallying with <b>me.</b> I <b>almost</b> believe you don't ever really mean to marry me.' ...|$|R

500|$|Film critic Glenn Kenny wrote, [...] "Che {{seems to}} <b>me</b> <b>almost</b> the polar {{opposite}} of agitprop. It flat out does {{not ask for}} the kind of emotional engagement that more conventional epic biopics do, and that's a good thing". In his review for UGO, Keith Uhlich wrote, [...] "The best to say about Del Toro's Cannes-honored performance is that it's exhausting—all exterior, no soul, like watching an android run a gauntlet (one that includes grueling physical exertions, tendentious political speechifying, and risible Matt Damon cameos)". Slant magazine gave Che two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, [...] "The problem is that, despite his desire to sidestep Hollywood bio-hooey, the director is unable to turn his chilly stance into an ideological perspective, like Roberto Rossellini did in his demythologized portraits of Louis XIV, Garibaldi and Pascal".|$|E
500|$|Vivien saw Barney as a muse and as Barney put it, [...] "she {{had found}} new {{inspiration}} through <b>me,</b> <b>almost</b> without knowing me." [...] Barney felt Vivien had cast {{her as a}} femme fatale and that she wanted [...] "to lose herself... entirely in suffering" [...] {{for the sake of}} her art. Vivien also believed in fidelity, which Barney was unwilling to agree to. While Barney was visiting her family in Washington, D.C. in 1901, Vivien stopped answering her letters. Barney tried to get her back for years, at one point persuading a friend, operatic mezzo-soprano Emma Calvé, to sing under Vivien's window so she could throw a poem (wrapped around a bouquet of flowers) up to Vivien on her balcony. Both flowers and poem were intercepted and returned by a governess.|$|E
500|$|Among the {{accessories}} shown, {{the wings}} worn {{in the video}} were made by Jim Henson Studios and her own creative team, Haus of Gaga, created the arrows. Gaga told Access Hollywood about the shoot at Hearst Castle and the main idea behind the video: [...] "It was a great experience writing the treatment working with everyone and I was like, 'Don't touch anything, and if you knock over a sculpture I'm going to pass out!'. The intention of the video was to create something that was a true sort of road map of my journey, being an artist, a pop singer, a creative person..... It's interesting because in this video the fashion and the psychotic sort of whimsy is all happening around me and it's <b>me</b> <b>almost</b> like Alice in Wonderland going through my own rabbit hole in my brain and re-experiencing the past year of my life. Every moment that we were filming together was really joyous and really fun." ...|$|E

500|$|Bobby Orr {{displayed}} his hockey talents from {{an early}} age. Orr played his first organized hockey in 1953 at age five, in the [...] "minor squirt" [...] division, a year after getting his first skates and playing shinny. Although he was tiny and somewhat frail, he soon was able to skate faster than anyone his own age, speed he demonstrated in races around the rink and in games. Until he was ten years old, Orr played on the wing, as a forward. His coach, former NHL player Bucko McDonald moved Orr to defence. Although Orr played defence, McDonald encouraged Orr to use his talents as a stickhandler, skater and scorer to make offensive rushes. According to McDonald: [...] "I used to tell Doug the kid was in his natural position when he played defence. You didn't have to be genius to see that – honest. I don't think Doug agreed, but he accepted my decision." [...] Orr would later credit McDonald: [...] "Bucko taught <b>me</b> <b>almost</b> everything I know." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Via Negativa" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Michael Roffman of Time named it the [...] "best post-Mulder" [...] episode, stating that [...] "episodes like this proved {{there were just}} enough thrills to get by without Spooky". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] and noted that the episode had an [...] "undeniable power that took <b>me</b> <b>almost</b> entirely off-guard". Although cautioning that [...] "Via Negativa" [...] is not [...] "some kind of lost classic" [...] and that the story itself was not [...] "all that impressive", he praised {{the atmosphere of the}} episode, describing it as [...] "heavy, doom-laden, and frequently bizarre". In fact, he argued that it largely [...] "makes up for any shortcomings in the script". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five and called it [...] "one of the best standalone X-Files in years." ...|$|E
500|$|English fantasy author Neil Gaiman guest {{starred in}} the episode as himself, helping Homer and the others write the book. He {{recorded}} his lines in January 2011 in Los Angeles, California {{under the direction of}} Selman. Gaiman has said that when he first agreed to guest star, he assumed he would only be getting a brief appearance, popping up for a few seconds. He told the press that [...] "when they actually sent me the script and I started to read it and discovered that I was in it all the way through and was actually having to act and that stuff happened, it was enormously fun." [...] Gaiman also noted that he does not think the episode gives an entirely accurate portrayal of him, commenting: [...] "Truthfully, the real-life <b>me</b> <b>almost</b> never hangs around in Barnes & Noble-like bookstores waiting to find groups of local townsfolk who've decided to write pseudonymous young adult fantasy series, offering my services. And even if I did, I probably wouldn't be doing the catering." [...] On his official Tumblr page, Gaiman noted that while he did not have much input on the story, he got to improvise while recording and gave suggestions on how to make his dialogue sound as close to something he might actually say in real life.|$|E

2500|$|Described by Warren Ellis as [...] "probably {{the single}} most {{influential}} writer in British comics", Wagner is named as an influence by writers such as Alan Grant, who says he [...] "taught <b>me</b> <b>almost</b> all I know about comic writing", Garth Ennis, Andy Diggle and Rob Williams. Alan Moore {{was inspired by the}} work of Wagner and Pat Mills in 2000 AD to try and express his ideas in mainstream comics. Wagner's own influences include the comics of D. C. Thomson & Co. of the '60s and '70s. Outside of comics, authors he admires include John Steinbeck, Patrick O'Brian and Michael Connelly.|$|E
2500|$|His wife Ellen's failing health, due to kidney failure, worsened in {{the spring}} of 1914; after a fall, she was bedridden, then rallied briefly, but Wilson wrote [...] "my dear one… grows weaker and weaker, with a pathetic {{patience}} and sweetness." [...] He was at her bedside to the end, which came August 6, when Wilson despairingly said [...] "Oh my God, what am I to do." [...] Wilson later wrote accurately of his mourning and depression, [...] "Of course you know what has happened to me…God has stricken <b>me</b> <b>almost</b> beyond what I can bear". Six months of depression followed for him, though mourning continued. At the same time that Wilson's private world shattered, World War I broke out in Europe, and this momentously changed his political life.|$|E
2500|$|The persuasive {{power of}} {{language}} is first alluded to by Charles, who tells Joan after she has assured him she can end {{the siege of}} Orléans, [...] "Thou hast astonished me with thy high terms" [...] (1.2.93). This sense is repeated when the Countess of Auvergne is wondering about Talbot and says to her servant, [...] "Great is the rumour of this dreadful knight,/And his achievements of no less account./Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,/To give their censure of these rare reports" [...] (2.3.7–10). Like Charles, Auvergne has been astonished with the 'high terms' bestowed on Talbot, and now she wishes {{to see if the}} report and the reality conflate. Later in the play, the persuasive power of language becomes important for Joan, as she uses it as a subterfuge to sneak into Rouen, telling her men, [...] "Be wary how you place your words;/Talk like the vulgar sort of market men/That come to gather money for their corn" [...] (3.2.3.5). Later, she uses language to persuade Burgundy to join with the Dauphin against the English. As Burgundy realises he is succumbing to her rhetoric, he muses to himself, [...] "Either she hath bewitched me with her words,/Or nature makes me suddenly relent" [...] (3.3.58–59). Here, language is shown to be so powerful as to act on Burgundy the same way Nature itself would act, {{to the point where he}} is unsure if he has been persuaded by a natural occurrence or by Joan's words. Language is thus presented as capable of transforming ideology. As Joan finishes her speech, Burgundy again attests to the power of her language, [...] "I am vanquish'd. These haughty words of hers/Have battered me like roaring canon-shot,/And made <b>me</b> <b>almost</b> yield upon my knees" [...] (3.3.78–80). Later, something similar happens with Henry, who agrees to marry Margaret merely because of Suffolk's description of her. In a line that echoes Burgundy's, Henry queries what it is that has prompted him to agree to Suffolk's suggestion: [...] "Whether it be through force of your report,/My noble lord of Suffolk, or for that/My tender youth was never yet attaint/With any passion of inflaming love, I cannot tell" [...] (5.6.79–83). Here, again, the power of language is shown to be so strong as to be confused with a natural phenomenon.|$|E
