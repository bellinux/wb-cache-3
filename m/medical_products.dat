5|$|The ACCC {{conceded that}} the state governments were not {{carrying}} on businesses in procuring the <b>medical</b> <b>products.</b> This meant that the governments were immune from Sections46 and 47 of the TPA.

Calmic produced hygiene and <b>medical</b> <b>products</b> on the site including tablets, creams, analgesics and antibiotic aerosols; they constructed industrial facilities adjacent to the hall including a drying and filtration plant and pharmaceutical packaging unit. After Wellcome's acquisition of Calmic in 1965, the hall served as the UK and Ireland headquarters of the Wellcome Foundation until the merger with Glaxo in 1995.

In 1904, one of McNeil's sons, Robert Lincoln McNeil, {{became part of the}} company and {{together}} they created McNeil Laboratories in 1933. The company focused on direct marketing of prescription drugs to hospitals, pharmacists, and doctors. Development of acetaminophen began under the leadership of Robert L. McNeil, Jr., who later served as the firm's chairman. In 1959, Johnson & Johnson acquired McNeil Laboratories and a year later the company was able to sell Tylenol for the first time ever, without a prescription. In 1977, two subsidiary companies were created; McNeil <b>medicals</b> <b>products</b> and McNeil Consumer Products Company (also known as McNeil Consumer Healthcare). The focus of McNeil <b>medicals</b> <b>products</b> is to market prescription drugs. In 1993 McNeil <b>medicals</b> <b>products</b> merged with the Ortho Pharmaceutical to form Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical. In 2001 McNeil Consumer Healthcare changed its name to McNeil Consumer & Specialty <b>medicals</b> <b>products.</b> However, it was later changed to [...] "McNeil Consumer Healthcare".

40|$|Abstract. This paper mainly {{analyses}} and discusses the application {{and significance of}} the visual negative afterimage on the colour design of <b>medical</b> <b>product</b> based on the visual negative afterimage theory. The design for the colour of <b>medical</b> <b>product</b> based on the visual negative afterimage theory focuses more human orientation in aspect of the visual effect design. The paper {{also points out that}} the trend of future design is to organically combine the art, the therapy features and the humanity. The complementary colour equilibrium of the visual negative afterimage will play a more and more important role in the colour design of the <b>medical</b> <b>product.</b> In the modern medical environment, the colour of the <b>medical</b> <b>product</b> has a decisive effect on the information exchange between people and the space environment. Although the visual negative afterimage is common in our daily life, the colour is not taken into consideration in the colour design of the <b>medical</b> <b>product,</b> which will result in negative effects. The colour is a strong and extremely attractive expression tool. Therefore, when the colour is designed for the <b>medical</b> <b>product,</b> it should be applied reasonably. The application of colour must be based on the special function requirements and the use of different people, so as to show its special function and requirements, which not only avoids the negative influence caused by the visual negative afterimage, but also creates a more humanistic atmosphere for the medical environment [1]...|$|R

25|$|Servetus was {{the first}} European to {{describe}} the function of pulmonary circulation, although his achievement was not widely recognized at the time, for a few reasons. One was that the description appeared in a theological treatise, Christianismi Restitutio, not in a book on medicine. However, the sections in which he refers to anatomy and medicines demonstrate an amazing understanding {{of the body and}} treatments. Most copies of the book were burned shortly after its publication in 1553 because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities. Three copies survived, but these remained hidden for decades. In passage V, Servetus recounts his discovery that the blood of the pulmonary circulation flows from the heart to the lungs (rather than air in the lungs flowing to the heart as had been thought). His discovery was based on the colour of the blood, the size and location of the different ventricles, {{and the fact that the}} pulmonary vein was extremely large, which suggested that it performed intensive and transcendent exchange. However, Servetus does not only deal with cardiology. In the same passage, from page 169 to 178, he also refers to the brain, the cerebellum, the meninges, the nerves, the eye, the tympanum, the rete mirabile, etc., demonstrating a great knowledge of anatomy. In some other sections of this work he also talks of <b>medical</b> <b>products.</b>|$|E
25|$|Manufacturing, printing, {{publishing}} and food processing also play major {{roles in the}} city's economy. Several <b>medical</b> <b>products</b> and services companies are headquartered in the Chicago area, including Baxter International, Boeing, Abbott Laboratories, and the Healthcare division of General Electric.

Moreover, {{the construction of the}} Illinois and Michigan Canal, which helped move goods from the Great Lakes south on the Mississippi River, and of the railroads in the 19th century made the city a major transportation center in the United States. In the 1840s, Chicago became a major grain port, and in the 1850s and 1860s Chicago's pork and beef industry expanded. As the major meat companies grew in Chicago many, such as Armour and Company, created global enterprises. Though the meatpacking industry currently plays a lesser role in the city's economy, Chicago continues to be a major transportation and distribution center. Lured by a combination of large business customers, federal research dollars, and a large hiring pool fed by the area's universities, Chicago is also the site {{of a growing number of}} web startup companies like CareerBuilder, Orbitz, 37signals, Groupon, Feedburner, and NowSecure.|$|E
