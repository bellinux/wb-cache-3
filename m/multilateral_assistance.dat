5|$|In December 1999, President Fernando de la Rúa took office, seeking {{assistance}} from the IMF shortly thereafter. In March 2000, the IMF agreed to a three-year $7.2 billion stand-by arrangement with Argentina, conditioned on a strict fiscal adjustment and the assumption of 3.5% GDP growth in 2000 (actual growth was 0.5%). In late 2000, Argentina began to experience severely diminished access to capital markets, as reflected in a sharp and sustained rise in spreads on Argentine bonds over U.S. Treasuries. In December, The de la Rua government announced a $40 billion <b>multilateral</b> <b>assistance</b> package organized by IMF. The uneven implementation of fiscal adjustments and reforms, a worsening global macroeconomic environment, and political instability led to {{the complete loss of}} market access and intensified capital flight by the second quarter of 2001. Argentine debt, held mostly in bonds, was massively sold short and the government found itself unable to borrow or meet debt payments.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Vietnam {{relied on the}} {{assistance}} of West German, Italian, and Canadian companies for offshore oil exploration. This ended in 1981, but resumed subsequently with Soviet technical assistance. Aid from China, reportedly close to US$300 million in 1977 and 1978, dropped to zero in 1979, and Vietnamese recovery in coal production was profoundly affected by the accompanying loss of ethnic Chinese workers. In 1979 Japan suspended its Official Development Assistance funds (a mixture of grants and low-interest loans amounting to US$135 million) and made renewal contingent upon Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia. Loss of other Western aid in hard currencies crippled Vietnam's ability to continue importing needed modern machinery and technology from its West European trading partners. Following Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia, only Sweden continued to provide any significant amount of economic help. Some <b>multilateral</b> <b>assistance,</b> such as that for development of the Mekong River, was made available by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, however. Western and <b>multilateral</b> <b>assistance,</b> therefore, did not stop entirely, although the yearly average of about US$100 million through 1986 provided {{only a fraction of}} the country's hard-currency needs. In 1986 Vietnam's current account deficit with major industrial countries was some US$221 million. The conflicts with Cambodia and China in 1978 and 1979 proved particularly costly in terms of continuing economic ties with Western and neighboring Asian countries. As a result, Hanoi was forced to rely even more heavily on Soviet-bloc assistance.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most recent}} conference, held in May 2011 in Istanbul, {{recognized}} {{that the nature of}} development had fundamentally changed since the 1st conference held almost 30 years earlier. In the 21st century, the capital flow into emerging economies has increasingly become dominated by foreign direct investment and remittances, as opposed to bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> <b>assistance.</b> Moreover, since the 80s, significant structural changes have taken place on the international stage. With the creation of the G-20 conference of the largest economic powers, including many nations in the Global South, formerly [...] "undeveloped" [...] nations are now able to have a much larger say in international relations. Furthermore, the conference recognized that {{in the midst of a}} deep global recession, coupled with multiple crises (energy, climate, food, etc.), the international community would have fewer resources to aid the LDCs. Thus, the UN considered the participation of a wide range of stakeholders (not least the LDCs themselves), crucial to the formulation of the conference.|$|E
5000|$|Togo {{returned}} to the Paris Club in 1995 and received Naples terms, the club's most concessionary rates. With the economic downturn associated with Togo's political problems, scheduled external debt service obligations for 1994 were greater than 100% of projected government revenues (excluding bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> <b>assistance).</b> By 2001, Togo was embarked on an IMF Staff Monitored Program designed to restore macroeconomic stability and financial discipline but without any new IMF resources pending new legislative elections. New IMF, World Bank and Africa Development Bank (ADB) lending must await the willingness of Togo's traditional donors [...] - [...] the European Union, principally, but the US also [...] - [...] to resume aid flows. So far, Togo's problematic legislative and presidential elections and the government's continued unwillingness to transition from an Eyadéma-led autocracy to democracy have deterred these donors from providing Togo with more aid. As of the fall 2002, Togo was $15 million in arrears to the World Bank and owed $3 million to the ADB.|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, Thailand {{faced an}} {{economic}} crisis stemming {{from a variety of}} pressures. During the ten year span between 1987 and 1997, Thailand's current account deficit continued to grow. By 1996, the deficit had grown to 7.887% of the total GDP. During this same period, foreign direct investment increased sharply as continuing currency devaluations, first in the 1980's and then as an effect of the Plaza Accord. Real estate investors overestimated the demand for real estate and used the Bangkok International Banking Facility's relatively cheap loans on construction projects that were left vacant due to lower demand than initially thought. [...] Predicting further currency devaluation, speculators launched a series of attacks on the Thai Baht. The Thai government initially attempted to protect the Baht by buying it back and expending its international reserves, but was ultimately forced to float the currency. In August of 1997, the IMF unveiled a relief package for Thailand that would offer a total of 17.2 billion US dollar's worth of bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> <b>assistance.</b> The initial period of policy-making was designed to manage the baht's floating exchange rates, restructure Thai financial institutions, cut public expenditures, promote the private sector, and to attract more foreign capital. The IMF's conditionality for the Thai bailout is characterized by monetary policy reform, fiscal policy reform, and financial sector reform.|$|E

50|$|During the {{subsequent}} years, UNIDO continuously expanded particularly its operational activities. However, several developments outside {{and inside the}} Organization led to a crisis, which reached a breaking point in 1997 when UNIDO faced the risk of closure: After {{the end of the}} Cold War and the triumph of the market economic system over the command economic system, and in view of the Washington Consensus that limited the role of industrial policy in economic development processes, some Member States felt that industrial development could be supported more effectively and efficiently by the private sector. As a result, Canada, the United States (UNIDO's then largest donor), and Australia subsequently withdrew from the Organization between 1993 and 1997. Simultaneously, the continued slowdown in the economies of some major industrialized countries as well as the financial turmoil of the 1997 Asian financial crisis caused <b>multilateral</b> development <b>assistance</b> to decline. In addition, a weak management structure and lack of focus and integration of UNIDO's activities contributed to aggravate the crisis.|$|R

40|$|Through a {{detailed}} reconstruction of American rearmament programs to Italy from {{the birth of}} NATO through the implementation of <b>multilateral</b> military <b>assistance</b> during the early 1950 s, this research challenges {{the idea that the}} end of reconstruction marked a striking American shift from economic aid to defense policies. The case study of Italy highlights the impact that the defense procurement contracts had both on monetary stability and balance of payments, as well as the integration of the Italian products within the infant European trade area. This monograph demonstrates that through military assistance the United States promoted balance of payments equilibrium and expansionary domestic aggregate demand to lay down the foundation of a mass consumption market. Furthermore, this work makes the point that the Italian elites resorted to Italy's industrial role as production source for NATO to both export manufactured products to the West European economies and import high added value instrumental goods from the U.

50|$|The {{many foreign}} {{advisers}} from, principally, the United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden were often {{under contract to}} the international financial institutions and bilateral or <b>multilateral</b> technical <b>assistance</b> programmes. They favoured free trade and exchange rate convertibility rather than trade protection and capital controls, which might have checked capital flight. They tended to support privatization without prior industrial restructuring; an exception was {{to be found in}} Eastern Germany where the Treuhand (Trust Agency) prepared state-owned enterprises for the market at considerable cost to the government. Western technical assistance programmes were established by European Union - through the Phare and TACIS programmes - and other donors (including the US AID, the UK Know-how Fund and UNDP) and by the IMF, the World Bank, EBRD and KfW, which also advanced loans for stabilization, structural adjustment, industrial restructuring and social protection. Technical assistance was delivered through the exchange of civil servants and by management consultants, including Agriconsulting, Atos, COWI, Ernst & Young, GOPA, GTZ, Human Dynamics, Idom, IMC Consulting, Louis Berger, NIRAS, PA Consulting, PE International, Pohl Consulting, PwC, and SOFRECO.|$|R

30|$|According to {{critical}} and Marxist theories, foreign aid aims to preserve capitalist exploitation (Lancaster 2008 : 3; Haan 2009 : 3). Marxists stress that ODA perpetuates the North-South division {{between rich and}} poor countries. Structuralists denounce that the capitalist model promoted by the West entails a trade system in which rich countries exploit poor nations (Pollock et al. 2001 : 16), and therefore, ODA only perpetuates the structural dominance of the centre over the periphery. For the proponents of these schools, bilateral ODA should be substituted by <b>multilateral</b> <b>assistance</b> (Hook 1995; Schraeder et al. 1998 : 3 - 4). Marxist theories challenge the legitimacy of foreign assistance and claim that it should be ended. In their interpretation, if there were any development programs, they should be managed and implemented by renewed democratic international organisations.|$|E
40|$|Summary. - The Convention on Biological Diversity {{addresses}} two controversies {{that surround}} {{plant genetic resources}} (PGRs). One debate has been over property rights governing PGRs {{and the distribution of}} benefits from their use. The second has been over the adequacy of measures to maintain crop genetic diversity. This paper examines how these two debates are linked and reviews previous multilateral attempts to address them. The Convention signals wider international acceptance of stricter property rights over PGRs and the need for <b>multilateral</b> <b>assistance</b> for PGR conservation. However, current proposals to implement the Convention appear too limited in scope to achieve their stated conservation objectives, while several areas of controversy remain. These include debates over: (i) intellectual property protection for biological inventions; (ii) control over PGRs in international gene banks; (iii) the international biosafety protocol regulating biotechnology; (iv) mechanisms to finance PGR conservation; and (v) th...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until 24 {{months after the}} date of publication. We use a novel continuous-time Weibull model (without and) with a change-point in the {{duration}} dependence parameter to investigate {{the duration of the}} exit and re-entry of sovereigns to international capital markets. Relying on annual data for a large panel of countries over the period 1970 - 2011, we find that, as the reputation of debtor countries as good (bad) borrowers solidifies over time, those episodes are more likely to end - i. e. the "legacy of time". Debtor countries {{can take advantage of the}} "benefit of doubt" of creditors during short exit spells. However, when exits are long and the reputation as a bad borrower emerges, no more "complacency" makes it more difficult for them to borrow again in international capital markets - i. e. the "tyranny of time". We also find that: (i) government stability and <b>multilateral</b> financial <b>assistance</b> play a crucial role; (ii) the dynamics of the duration of exit (re-entry) spells is robust to the presence of default episodes, the default length and the haircut size; and (iii) exit and re-entry have shortened over time...|$|R
