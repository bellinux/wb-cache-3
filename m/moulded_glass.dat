40|$|The {{increasing}} {{demands for}} optical glass components, such as aspherical lenses, require flexible and economical production processes. In particular the high surface complexity {{in combination with}} high form accuracies will limit the usage of existing manufacturing technologies. High precision <b>glass</b> <b>moulding</b> technologies have great potential to fulfil the needs of an economical manufacturing process for complex shaped optical components. Due to the different material properties of <b>glass</b> and <b>mould</b> material the process chain is driven by empirical iteration cycles between mould making and moulding. Today two to three cycles are necessary to reach the final accuracies on the moulded parts.

Because dies for pressing metal panels are so costly, from the mid 20th century, many vehicles, most notably the Chevrolet Corvette, were clothed with large panels of glass-fibre reinforced resin, which only require inexpensive <b>moulds.</b> <b>Glass</b> has since been replaced by more sophisticated materials but generally these replace, if necessary hand-formed, metal only where weight is of paramount importance.|$|R

40|$|The {{high-temperature}} behaviour {{of various}} mould materials and coatings was studied by subjecting to cyclic temperature changes in oxidizing atmosphere and to {{contact with a}} soda-lime-silica glass melt at 1050 deg C. In a cyclic immersion test {{the influence of the}} type of mould material, type of coating, surface roughness and of temperature on the tendency of sticking to the glass melt was investigated. In the base materials the corrosive attack mainly occurred along grain boundaries and in softer phases of the materials, starting from the surfaces. Defects in the <b>moulded</b> <b>glass</b> surfaces, worn-off particles from the moulds and microcracks due to adhesion were found to depend on the type of oxide layer formed on the mould surface. Some ceramic nitride PVD films proved highly resistant to oxidation and abrasion, and caused no detectable damage of the glass.

They were foun d to increase exponentially with temperature up to permanent adhesion. AB of the mould materials investigated showed the same dependency of separation forces on temperature.

No slip was observed between the concrete and GFRP box sections until the longitudinal shear failure occurred at the initial peak. The load capacity carried on increasing at a reduced stiffness in a progressive manner, with significant residual strength and slip observed. All specimens failed by the separation of the webs and flange at the upper corners of the box sections due to the large curvature induced. Full-scale experimental results demonstrated that the controlled longitudinal shear failure provided deformability to the overall system and a robust interaction between the concrete and FRP formwork was achieved...|$|E

FEM {{has been applied to}} analyse the influence of interlayers on the stress distribution around cylindrical fibres in an elastic matrix. This being part of a research programme aiming to enhance the energy absorption characteristics of composites by means of interlayers from materials exhibiting high ductility under plane strain conditions, e. g. UHMWPE. The theoretical model is based on the Galerkin weighted residual finite element in conjunction with a "penalty approach". The advantage of this method for polymer composites is in its ability to cope very effectively with non-linear systems. Glass microscope slides were initially used to develop a technique for bonding the ductile layers on to glass and polyamides respectively, as well as to provide simple verifications of the applicability of the aforementioned model. Further experiments were carried out on glass fibres coated with UHMWPE from a xylene solution, in order to evaluate the applicability of the above technique and of the theoretical model in actual composite systems. Although great difficulties were encountered in achieving a well bonded uniform coating on the glass fibres the results have confirmed the viability of the approach: The impact strength of compression <b>moulded</b> <b>glass</b> reinforced Nylon plaques, measured with an instrumented falling weight apparatus was increased up to 400...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new concept}} for an FRP-Concrete composite floor system. The system consists of a <b>moulded</b> <b>glass</b> fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) grating adhesively bonded to rectangular pultruded GFRP box sections as structural formwork for a concrete slab. Holes cut into the top flange of the box sections at a variable spacing allow concrete 'studs' to form at the grating/box interface. During casting, GFRP dowels are inserted into the holes to further connect the grating and box sections. Following preliminary component tests on two concrete blocks, experimental {{results show that the}} concrete filled grating provides a 100 % increase in strain capacity when compared to a plain concrete block. It is therefore feasible to provide ductility to the complete system through the concrete in compression. Four push-out GFRP grating-box section specimens were then tested in double shear to assess the shear behaviour of the proposed GFRP dowel shear connector in both partially concrete-filled and fully concrete-filled box sections. From the resulting load-slip curves, a progressive longitudinal shear failure was seen to be provided by such a connection. The experimental results indicate that this type of shear connection can provide robustness and reasonable ductility to the system. Research is now underway to test a complete prototype system under variable load conditions to examine whether the behaviour is as predicte...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} stay-in-place (SIP) {{structural}} formwork {{has the potential}} to simplify and accelerate the construction process to a great extent. Fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) SIP structural formwork offers further potential benefits over existing formwork systems in terms of ease and speed of construction, improved site safety and reduced long-term maintenance in corrosive environments. However, it is not without its limitations, including primarily the possibility of a lack of ductility, which is a key concern regarding the use of FRP structural formwork in practice. This thesis presents the findings of an experimental and analytical investigation into a novel FRP SIP structural formwork system for a concrete slab with a particular emphasis on its ability to achieve a ductile behaviour. The proposed composite system consists of a <b>moulded</b> <b>glass</b> fibre-reinforced polymer (GFRP) grating adhesively bonded to square pultruded GFRP box sections. The grating is subsequently filled with concrete to form a concrete-FRP composite floor slab. Holes cut into the top flange of the box sections allow concrete studs to form at the grating/box-section interface. During casting, GFRP dowels are inserted into the holes to further mechanically connect the grating and box sections. An initial experimental investigation into using GFRP grating as confinement for concrete showed that a significant increase in ultimate strength and strain capacity could be achieved compared to unconfined concrete. This enhanced strain capacity in compression allows greater use of the FRP capacity in tension when used in a floor slab system. Further experimental investigation into developing ductility at the grating/box-section interface showed that the proposed shear connection exhibited elastic-â€˜plasticâ€™ behaviour. This indicated the feasibility of achieving ductility through progressive and controlled longitudinal shear failure. Following these component tests on the concrete-filled grating and the shear connectors, a total of six (300 x 150 x 3000) mm slab specimens were designed and tested under five-point bending. It was found that the behaviour of all specimens was ductile in nature, demonstrating that the proposed progressive longitudinal shear failure was effective. A three-stage analytical model was developed to predict the load at which the onset of longitudinal shear failure occurred, the stiffness achieved during the post elastic behaviour and, finally, the deflection at which ultimate failure occurred. Close agreement was found between experimental results and the theory. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
