25|$|The {{pipeline}} allowed barn {{length to}} keep increasing and expanding, {{but after a}} point farmers started to milk the cows in large groups, filling the barn with one-half to one-third of the herd, milking the animals, and then emptying and refilling the barn.

25|$|As {{measured}} in phosphorus, the waste output of 5,000 cows roughly equals a municipality of 70,000 people. In the U.S., dairy operations {{with more than}} 1,000 cows meet the EPA definition of a CAFO (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation), and are subject to EPA regulations. For example, in the San Joaquin Valley of California a number of dairies have been established on a very large scale. Each dairy consists of several modern <b>milking</b> <b>parlor</b> set-ups operated as a single enterprise. Each <b>milking</b> <b>parlor</b> {{is surrounded by a}} set of 3 or 4 loafing barns housing 1,500 or 2,000 cattle. Some of the larger dairies have planned 10 or more series of loafing barns and milking parlors in this arrangement, so that the total operation may include as many as 15,000 or 20,000 cows. The milking process for these dairies is similar to a smaller dairy with a single <b>milking</b> <b>parlor</b> but repeated several times. The size and concentration of cattle creates major environmental issues associated with manure handling and disposal, which requires substantial areas of cropland (a ratio of 5 or 6 cows to the acre, or several thousand acres for dairies of this size) for manure spreading and dispersion, or several-acre methane digesters. Air pollution from methane gas associated with manure management also is a major concern. As a result, proposals to develop dairies of this size can be controversial and provoke substantial opposition from environmentalists including the Sierra Club and local activists.|$|E

The basic objective is to put forward the recent changes through the state supports provided to dairy facilities of the Central Anatolian Provinces.

2500|$|Plate heat {{exchangers}} have also evolved {{as a result}} of the increase of dairy farm herd sizes in the United States. As a dairyman increases the size of his herd, he must also increase the capacity of his <b>milking</b> <b>parlor</b> in order to harvest the additional milk. This increase in parlor sizes has resulted in tremendous increases in milk throughput and cooling demand. Today's larger farms produce milk at a rate which direct expansion refrigeration systems on bulk milk coolers cannot cool in a timely manner. PHE's are typically utilized in this instance to rapidly cool the milk to the desired temperature (or close to it) before it reaches the bulk milk tank. Typically, ground water is still utilized to provide some initial cooling to bring the milk to between [...] A second (and sometimes third) section of the PHE is added to remove the remaining heat with a mixture of chilled pure water and propylene glycol. These chiller systems can be made to incorporate large evaporator surface areas and high chilled water flow rates to cool high flow rates of milk.|$|E

40|$|Grain feeding is an {{important}} part of a dairy feeding program. Grain supplies energy in a concentrated form and when fed as a supplement to forage permits cows to maintain high levels of production. Also, if the forage is of low quality, additional protein and other nutrients can be supplied with the grain in a concentrate mix. By feeding a balanced concentrate mix, according to individual production, each cow receives the necessary nutrients for production. Dairy cows are usually fed grain individually. During recent years dairy herds have increased in size and <b>milking</b> <b>parlors</b> have been developed in which to milk cows more efficiently. In <b>milking</b> <b>parlors</b> cows are generally fed grain individually. However, the cows are milked so rapidly that there is insufficient time for them to consume more than a few pounds of grain. Cows not consuming all of their grain, while being milked, are left in the stall until the remaining grain is eaten, thus delaying the milking operation or turned out without consuming the allotted amount of grain...|$|R

40|$|Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) {{is being}} {{developed}} in livestock farms to relieve the human workload and to help farmers to optimize production and management procedure. The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the consequences in energy intensity and the related carbon impact, from dairy farm to cheese factory, due to the implementation of a real-time milk analysis and separation (AfiMilk MCS) in <b>milking</b> <b>parlors.</b> The research carried out involved three conventional dairy farms, the collection and delivery of milk from dairy farms to cheese factory and the processing line of a traditional soft cheese into a dairy factory. The AfiMilk MCS system installed in the <b>milking</b> <b>parlors</b> allowed to obtain a large number of information related to {{the quantity and quality of}} milk from each individual cow and to separate milk with two different composition (one with high coagulation properties and the other one with low coagulation properties), with different percentage of separation. Due to the presence of an additional milkline and the AfiMilk MCS components, the energy requirements and the related environmental impact at farm level were slightly higher, among 1. 1 % and 4. 4 %. The logistic of milk collection was also significantly reorganized in view of the collection of two separate type of milk, hence, it leads an increment of 44 % of the energy requirements. The logistic of milk collection and delivery represents the process which the highest incidence in energy consumption occurred after the installation of the PLF technology. Thanks to the availability of milk with high coagulation properties, the dairy plant, produced traditional soft cheese avoiding the standardization of the formula, as a result, the energy uses decreased about 44 %, while considering the whole chain, the emissions of carbon dioxide was reduced by 69 %. In this study, the application of advance technologies in <b>milking</b> <b>parlors</b> modified not only the on-farm management but mainly the procedure carried out in cheese making plant.

40|$|Two {{directions}} can {{be distinguished}} {{in the development of}} high-tech milking equipment: 1) high-capacity <b>milking</b> <b>parlors</b> with a high throughput of cows per person per hour and 2) automatic milking systems in which manual labor is replaced by a milking robot. High-capacity <b>milking</b> <b>parlors</b> are developed {{in such a way that}} one operator is able to milk many cows, partly by automation and partly by optimization of available labor. In such parlors, one operator can milk up to 125 cows per hour. This means that there are only a few seconds available for udder preparation. In an automatic milking system, a robot takes over all manual labor during milking. Currently available systems have one robot arm working with one milking stall (one-stall system) or one robot arm working with more milking stalls (multiple-stall systems). Cows have to go to the automatic milking system voluntarily. Therefore, there is a large variation in milking intervals. Moreover, a large variation between milkings and between cows was observed in milk flow rate, machine-on time and udder preparation time. Both developments in high-tech milking have effects on the milk ejection. The small amount of time dedicated to udder preparation in high-capacity <b>milking</b> <b>parlors</b> has negative effects on the milk ejection, among others leading to more bimodal milk flow curves and longer machine-on time. In automatic milking systems, the variation in time between udder preparation and cluster attachment and in milking frequency might have an effect on milk ejection. Lactation physiology can play a role in solving the questions around milk ejection in high-tech milking systems. The introduction of high-tech milking systems makes decision support systems using sensors necessary. These systems should assist in detection of abnormal milk and mastitis. To a lesser extent, diseased cows need to be brought to the attention of the dairy farmer. Some sensors are currently available for this purpose, but they do not fulfill all demands. In the near future other sensors might be developed. It is important that this development is demand driven and not technology driven. Lactation physiology can play an important role in the determination of milk components useful for automatic detection...|$|R

This type of cooling utilizes an evaporator built directly into the inner wall of the storage tank to remove heat from the milk.
