5|$|A common neo-creationist {{objection}} to evolution is that evolution does not adhere to normal scientific standards—that {{it is not}} genuinely scientific. It is argued that evolutionary biology does not follow the scientific <b>method</b> <b>and</b> therefore should not be taught in science classes, or at least should be taught alongside other views (i.e., creationism). These objections often deal with {{the very nature of}} evolutionary theory, the scientific <b>method,</b> <b>and</b> philosophy of science.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the present land {{resource}} surveying <b>methods</b> <b>and</b> techniques used in Eritrea, to evaluate different <b>methods</b> <b>and</b> techniques of land resource surveying which are currently in use in various parts of the world, to design improved <b>methods</b> <b>and</b> techniques of land resource surveying for Eritrea and to indicate the importance of cost-effective ways of land resource surveying in achieving optimal land use. A literature survey of <b>methods</b> <b>and</b> techniques of soil, rangeland, and agro-climatic survey was done in-depth. An analysis was conducted on the present resource surveying methodologies and techniques used in Eritrea. International publications on land resource surveying <b>methods</b> <b>and</b> techniques were studies and evaluation of their appropriateness for Eritrea was conducted. Finally an appropriate and affordable set of land resource surveying methodologies and techniques are proposed for Eritrea. The main conclusion of the study is to adapt international <b>methods</b> <b>and</b> techniques of resource surveying which are appropriate under the country’s socio-economic and technical conditions. Developing local <b>methods</b> <b>and</b> techniques under present condition is not possible due to various reasons.
