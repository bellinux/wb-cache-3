500|$|Although he {{was raised}} in Europe by his French mother, his father, who was the 48th {{hereditary}} Imam of the Nizari Ismaili Muslims, had a strong influence on him. He recalled that his father [...] "insisted that I learnt the Koran and encouraged <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the basic traditions and beliefs of Islam but without imposing any particular views. He was an overwhelming personality but open-minded and liberal." ...|$|E

Woods later related that, {{although}} he continued to have concerns about [...] "the unavoidably racist aspects of Black Consciousness", it was [...] "both a revelation and education" [...] to socialise with blacks who had [...] "psychologically emancipated attitudes". Biko also remained friends with another prominent white liberal, Duncan Innes, who served as NUSAS President in 1969; Innes later commented that Biko was [...] "invaluable in helping <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> black oppression, not only socially and politically, but also psychologically and intellectually".

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jenna Bans and {{directed}} by Tom Verica. Edward Ornelas edited the episode, and Donald Lee Harris served as production designer. The episode's title refers to the song [...] "", by American alternative rock group Community Trolls. Featured music includes The Voluntary Butler Scheme's [...] "Trading Things In" [...] and Dragonette's [...] "Come On Be Good". Pompeo was pregnant during the episode, so the filming crew had to work around it. In the episode, Lexie advocated for Meredith to donate her liver, because she was unable to. Bans commented on this: [...] "It was REALLY easy for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> Lexie in this episode – 'cause that's how I imagine she grew up with [...] and Thatcher. There was taco night, and movie night, and if she had homework issues, {{one of them was}} always around to help. So now that her Dad needs some of her liver, recovering alcoholic or not, she’s gonna do it. She's not even thinking about the Chief's upcoming merger – and the fact that recovering from a major surgery will put her on the bench, out of the game, for at least a month. Lexie doesn't blink, because family isn't an obligation to her like it is {{for a lot of people}} - [...] it's a gift." [...] The scene in which Meredith offers her liver to Thatcher was originally intended to rekindle their relationship. Bans later changed this, following a request from Pompeo, and offered her insight: ...|$|E

However, Donald Winslow of The New York Times quoted Adams as having described the image as a 'reflex picture' and 'wasn't certain of what he'd photographed until the film was developed'. Furthermore, Winslow noted that Adams 'wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that “Saigon Execution” was not his most important picture {{and that he did}} not want his obituary to begin, “Eddie Adams, the photographer best known for his iconic Vietnam photograph ‘Saigon Execution’'.|$|E
2500|$|Invalid Channel said, [...] "Bajo and Hex are hilarious to watch, {{they have}} so many funny moments. You can tell they know their shit, too, they've been around the block {{when it comes to}} games and they use {{terminology}} without it sounding super lame and out of place. At the same time, they make it easy for non-gamers, or people who wish they were gamers (ie: <b>me)</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b> Bits and pieces feel really awkward though, and I know they put in awkward moments for comedic effect sometimes, but I find that these don't always have the comedic effect that they're probably going for, and end up going full circle just being plain awkward". It argues the [...] "small size and down-to-earth-ness" [...] of the show adds to its charm, by saying [...] "a commercial version of the show would be way too polished and just wouldn't feel right". It ended its review by saying [...] "all in all, Good Game is a good show [...] the reviews are quite good". While it thought there was room for improvement, it said [...] "the show's got it's [...] niche and it should stick to it".|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, I beseeched the Lord {{to teach}} me His statutes. After my prayer as usual I opened my Bible with closed eyes and {{put my finger on}} the right place. For the first time I opened Revelation 1:3"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand." [...] I asked the Lord: [...] "O Lord! What about until then?" [...] And again I opened the Bible, that time on 1 Timothy 1:15"This is a {{faithful}} saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief." [...] And for the third time I tempted the Lord, saying: [...] "O Lord! I am not an Abraham nor a Jew, I'm a sinner, but involve <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> Your Will." [...] And then I opened the Book of SirahJoshua 24:29-30, where I read in the new American Translation: [...] "Said to myself, I will water my plants, my flower bed I will drench; and suddenly this rivulet of mine became a river, then this stream of mine, a sea. Thus do I send my teaching forth shining like a dawn, to become known afar off. Thus do I pour out instruction like prophecy and bestow it on generations to come." ...|$|E
