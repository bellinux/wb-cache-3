5|$|Much of {{the public}} blamed Ernest for Sellis's death. The more extreme Whig papers, anti-royal pamphleteers, and caricaturists all offered nefarious {{explanations}} for Sellis's death, in which the Duke was to blame. Some stories had the Duke cuckolding Sellis, with the attack as retaliation, or Sellis killed for finding Ernest and Mrs. Sellis in bed together. Others suggested that the Duke was the lover of either Sellis or Neale, and that blackmail had {{played a part in}} the death. Both Roger Fulford and John Van der Kiste, who wrote books about George III's children, ascribe part of the animus and fear towards the Duke {{to the fact that he}} did not conduct love affairs in public, as did his older brothers. According to them, the public feared what vices <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> on behind the locked doors of the Duke's house, and assumed the worst.|$|E
500|$|Browning downplayed {{evidence}} {{brought to}} him by his intelligence officer, Major Brian Urquhart, that the 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen and the 10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg were in the Arnhem area, but was not as confident as he led his subordinates to believe. According to Major-General Urquhart, GOC of the British 1st Airborne Division, when informed that his airborne troops would have to hold the bridge for two days, Browning responded that they could hold it for four, but later claimed to Urquhart that he had added: [...] "But I think we <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> a bridge too far." ...|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant General Sir Frederick Arthur Montague [...] "Boy" [...] Browning, [...] (20 December 1896– 14 March 1965) was {{a senior}} officer of the British Army who {{has been called the}} [...] "father of the British {{airborne}} forces". He was the commander of I Airborne Corps and deputy commander of First Allied Airborne Army during Operation Market Garden in September 1944. During the planning for this operation, he memorably said: [...] "I think we <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> a bridge too far." [...] He was also an [...] Olympic bobsleigh competitor, and the husband of author Dame Daphne du Maurier.|$|E

60|$|Alda held up {{her hands}} in wonder. How many quarrels <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>going</b> on at that moment, if three of the family at least had not {{exercised}} the forbearance she so little understood.|$|R
6000|$|But {{whatever}} he <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>going</b> to say <b>was</b> at least postponed by {{the approach of}} a serving-maid, who brought a note to his daughter. She blushed a little at sight of it, and then tore it open and read: ...|$|R
500|$|Meanwhile [...] Mitford had {{completed}} her latest book, [...] Voltaire in Love, {{an account of}} the love affair between Voltaire and the Marquise du Châtelet. [...] She considered it her first truly grown-up work, and her best. Published in 1957, it sold well, was taken seriously by the critics and [...] was warmly praised by Mitford's friends. Its writing had been hampered by painful headaches arising from her apparently failing eyesight and [...] worries that she <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> blind. The problem was resolved after a visit to the ophthalmic surgeon Patrick Trevor-Roper, who gave her new spectacles: [...] "It is heavenly {{to be able to read}} for a long time on end & now I see how handicapped I was when doing Voltaire". She then returned to writing [...] fiction, with Don't Tell Alfred, in which she revived Fanny Wincham, the narrator of The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate, and placed her in a Paris setting as wife of the British ambassador. Several characters familiar from the earlier novels appear in minor roles. The book, published in October 1960, was popular with the public, but received indifferent reviews. Some of Mitford's friends disliked it, and she decided she would write no more fiction.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2008 Israeli {{archaeologist}} Yossi Garfinkel {{discovered a}} ceramic shard at Khirbet Qeiyafa which he claimed {{may be the}} earliest Hebrew writing yet discovered, dating around 3000 years ago. Hebrew University archaeologist Amihai Mazar said that the inscription was [...] "proto-Canaanite" [...] but cautioned that, [...] "The differentiation between the scripts, and between the languages themselves in that period, remains unclear," [...] and suggested that calling the text Hebrew <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> too far.|$|E
2500|$|The author’s second novel, Blood is a Stranger {{was set in}} Australia's Arnhem Land and Indonesia. This {{covered the}} ‘issue’ of the misuse of uranium mining and dangers of nuclear weapons, a theme in Perry’s early writing and {{documentary}} film-making. Stephen Knight in the Sydney Morning Herald wrote: Blood is a Stranger is a skilful and thoughtful thriller... with a busy plot and some interesting, unnerving speculations about what <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> {{on in the world}} of lasers, yellowcake (uranium mining and manufacture) and Asian politics—things that most people prefer to ignore in favour of more simple and familiar puzzles.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word, I could wish I {{had been}} less fortunate," [...] said Jack. [...] "For if I had been born benighted, I <b>might</b> now <b>be</b> <b>going</b> free; and it cannot be denied the iron is inconvenient, and the ulcer hurts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, but not here!' said Mrs Kenwigs. 'We are all so very {{friendly}} and pleasant, that you <b>might</b> as well <b>be</b> <b>going</b> through {{it in your}} own room; besides, the occasion--' ...|$|R
60|$|The Indian again looked {{long and}} earnestly at the child, {{as if he}} were {{considering}} how far such a juvenile mind <b>might</b> <b>be</b> capable of <b>going</b> into a theological discussion.|$|R
2500|$|Agnes, an upper-class {{woman in}} her late 50s, {{discusses}} the possibility of losing her mind. [...] Agnes exclaims that although she is astonished by her own thoughts of madness, it is her sister, Claire, who lives with them, who astonishes her the most. [...] Claire appears and apologizes to Agnes that her own nature is such to bring out in her sister {{the full force of}} her brutality. Claire senses that Tobias and Agnes’s daughter Julia <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> on her fourth divorce and predicts that Julia will be coming home shortly. [...] Agnes reenters, announcing that Julia is coming home. Tobias then {{tells the story of a}} cat that he once had. There is a knock on the door. Harry and Edna, Agnes and Tobias’s best friends, arrive and ask if they can stay there. They have been frightened by something intangible.|$|E
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} {{she had to}} go out with Loerke. Her tomorrow was perfectly vague before her. This was what gave her pleasure. She <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> to England with Gerald, she <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> to Dresden with Loerke, she <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> to Munich, to a girl-friend she had there. Anything might come to pass on the morrow. And today was the white, snowy iridescent threshold of all possibility. All possibility--that was the charm to her, the lovely, iridescent, indefinite charm,--pure illusion All possibility--because death was inevitable, and NOTHING was possible but death.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; only I {{thought you}} <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> to the yacht; and Valencia would have walked down with you. She {{wants to find}} Major Campbell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I suppose I <b>might</b> as well <b>be</b> <b>going</b> myself," [...] said she. [...] "And by the way, captain, if you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to town, why don't {{you take}} a seat in my carriage? Dear knows me and the boy don't fill it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>might</b> as well <b>be</b> <b>going</b> now," [...] {{said the}} Doctor, finally rising. [...] "You can {{stop at the}} fonda, about two miles further on, and get your supper and bed, if you like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{we shall}} {{find out who}} it was that {{disturbed}} us," [...] said Bob, gleefully, as he clambered upon the improvised platform, that he <b>might</b> see what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on outside from the peep-hole.|$|R
60|$|Simon Kenton {{moved here}} and there noiselessly as a cat, intent only upon {{learning}} {{so much of what}} <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> on outside as his ears could tell him.|$|E
60|$|Phil and Roger {{heard the}} {{conversation}} between Dave {{and the old}} sailor, and it worried them {{so much that they}} hurried below, to learn what <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> on.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understood}} from Mrs. Adding," [...] he concluded, [...] "that {{you were}} going. there for your after-cure, Mr. March, and I didn't know but you <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> soon." ...|$|E
60|$|These {{things were}} possible, {{and his heart}} fell; {{but it was not}} with fear. Dickory Charter was as bold a fellow as ever stood on the deck in a sea fight, but his heart fell at the thought that he <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>going</b> to her old home, and that he might not sail back with good news to her.|$|R
60|$|The air was {{as clear}} and fresh as on a {{mountain}} side; sparrows chattered, and birds of a species unsuspected at later hours could be heard singing in the park hard by, while here and there on ridges and flats a cat <b>might</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>going</b> calmly home from the devilries {{of the night to}} resume the amiabilities of the day.|$|R
6000|$|... "To-night {{is out of}} the {{question}} for me. I have an engagement that will keep me until late. To-morrow night, if you will, I shall be at your service." [...] And because he did not trust Samoval he added, as Samoval himself had almost reckoned: [...] "But I should prefer not to come to Bispo. I <b>might</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>going</b> or returning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"O no, no! I was {{thinking}} you <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> on {{to town to}} meet your mother. I saw her there--and {{she looked as if}} she might be expecting 'ee." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She didn't say nothing. I didn't stop. I {{just said}} what he said I was to and then I beat it. I thought she <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> to start weepin'." ...|$|E
60|$|There was an {{uncontrollable}} {{break in}} her voice. She had a dreadful {{feeling that she}} <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> to cry. She made a great effort to be cold and clear.|$|E
60|$|Toward {{the middle}} of the day two or three Indians <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> seen <b>going</b> through the village, {{summoning}} those whose position and rank entitled them to a place at the council.|$|R
6000|$|Blacky chuckled hoarsely. [...] "I didn't," [...] said he. [...] "I simply {{thought there}} <b>might</b> <b>be</b> {{something}} <b>going</b> on I didn't know about {{over here in}} the pond of Paddy the Beaver, so I came over to find out. Mr. Quack, you and Mrs. Quack are looking very fine this fall. And those handsome young Quacks, you don't {{mean to tell me}} that they are your children!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Elsa," [...] he said, in an irritated voice, [...] "everything {{seems to}} be very uncomfortable here to-day, there is so much {{disturbance}} in the house that one <b>might</b> imagine we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to shut it up and leave Leyden." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am glad to}} tell you, Mr Headstone, {{that the}} sister of your old pupil has not {{sustained}} any such loss. You thought I <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> down to bury some one?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Wondering {{a little}} at what <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> to happen to him, the youth did as the ogre bade him, and {{when they reached the}} shore of the lake, the ogre turned and said to him: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} would, mother," [...] the lad said, rising briskly; for his fits of {{indolence}} were {{by no means}} common and, as a rule, he was ready to assist at any work which <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> on.|$|E
6000|$|The silence, {{the rhythmic}} {{disappointment}} of the silence, {{came as a}} fresh shock. For a moment one could doubt whether one had ever heard a sound. Or whether it <b>might</b> not still <b>be</b> <b>going</b> on. Had I indeed heard a sound? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We <b>might</b> as well <b>be</b> <b>going,</b> Nappy," [...] said Slugger presently, {{and turned}} and hurried {{up the narrow}} street, and Gabe Werner went after them. Then, a moment later, the men {{returned}} to the restaurant to finish the meal they had begun.|$|R
6000|$|... "The fact is I {{sent over}} to New Leyden for my team yesterday. I {{did n't know}} how things might turn out, and you're so far from a lemon here, that I thought I <b>might</b> <b>be</b> useful in <b>going</b> errands." ...|$|R
