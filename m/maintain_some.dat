5|$|After hearing {{news that}} Syed {{is trying to}} find his wife Amira Shah (Preeya Kalidas), Yusef visits her father, Qadim (Ramon Tikaram) at his office and offers to avenge his family for causing Amira pain. When Zainab and Yusef attend an event together, people assume they are married and Zainab does not correct them. Afterwards, Yusef admits to Zainab that he has great {{feelings}} for her but they should <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> distance as she is married. Yusef continues to manipulate Zainab and ply her with pills, but she says she wishes to stop taking them, so Yusef crushes up a bottle of pills and conceals them in Zainab's food. Zainab passes out and is hospitalised, with her family believing she took a deliberate overdose, as was Yusef's plan. Concerned that he himself is causing Zainab's worries, Masood divorces Zainab by saying the triple talaq.|$|E
5|$|In early June 1940 {{following}} the lightning {{advance of the}} Germans through France and the subsequent Dunkirk evacuation, the British prime minister, Winston Churchill, realised the need for Britain to <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> form of offensive action and directed his chief staff officer and military adviser, General Hastings Ismay, to begin organising a force which could conduct raids {{along the coast of}} German-occupied Europe. Shortly after this, even before the concept had been fully developed, the War Office put out a request for volunteers among the troops in Britain to join a force they would be known as the Commandos. At this stage it was decided to create 12 commando units, each with an establishment of roughly 500 men.|$|E
5|$|Welders often {{develop a}} {{technique}} of rapidly alternating between moving the torch forward (to advance the weld pool) and adding filler metal. The filler rod is {{withdrawn from the}} weld pool each time the electrode advances, but it is always kept inside the gas shield to prevent oxidation of its surface and contamination of the weld. Filler rods composed of metals with a low melting temperature, such as aluminum, require that the operator <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> distance from the arc while staying inside the gas shield. If held {{too close to the}} arc, the filler rod can melt before it makes contact with the weld puddle. As the weld nears completion, the arc current is often gradually reduced to allow the weld crater to solidify and prevent the formation of crater cracks {{at the end of the}} weld.|$|E

5|$|General Marshall was Truman's {{principal}} adviser {{on foreign policy}} matters, influencing such decisions as the U.S. choice against offering direct military aid to Chiang Kai-shek and his Nationalist Chinese forces in the Chinese Civil War against their communist opponents. Marshall's opinion was contrary to the counsel of almost all of Truman's other advisers—Marshall thought propping up Chiang's forces would drain U.S. resources that were needed in Europe to deter the Soviets. When the communists {{took control of the}} mainland, establishing the People's Republic of China and driving the Nationalists to Taiwan, Truman would have been willing to <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> relationship between the U.S. and the new government but Mao was unwilling. On June 27, 1950, after the outbreak of fighting in Korea, Truman ordered the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent further conflict between the communist government on the China mainland and the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|While New World Cabernets are {{characterized}} as being drinkable earlier than Bordeaux, premium producers {{such as the}} Californian cult wines will produce wines that need time to age and could potentially develop {{for two to three}} decades. Overall, the majority of Californian Cabernets are meant to be approachable after only a couple of years in the bottle but can still have the potential to improve further over time. Similarly many premium Australian Cabernet will also need at least ten years to develop though many are approachable after two to five years. New Zealand wines are typically meant to be consumed young and will often maintain their green herbal flavors even with extended bottle aging. South American Cabernets have very pronounced fruit flavors when they are young and the best made examples will <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> of those flavors as they age. South African wines tend to favor more Old World styles and typically require six to eight years' aging before they start to develop further flavors.|$|E

They provide rules for sanctioning the conduct of the flying, specify age group and skill-level classifications among the racers, and <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> kind of points-accumulation system over the racing season. The sport is very family oriented and largely participant-driven, with riders ranging in age from 2 to 70, and over. Professional ranks exist for both men and women, where the age ranges from 18 to 40 years old.|$|E
25|$|No one {{can confirm}} when {{the concept of}} Taiwanization has started. Some people will say when {{the first wave of}} large Han People {{immigration}} decided to leave from mainland China to Taiwan in the mid-16th-century, then they must have had some concept to <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> independence from the control of ruling class in their original hometown. And some other people will say not until the Kingdom of Tungning, with its capital at Tainan, had been built by Zheng Family in 1662, this kind of concept hasn't appeared.|$|E

25|$|In other cases, {{it may be}} {{desirable}} to <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> degree of compatibility with simple AM receivers, while still reducing the signal's bandwidth. This {{can be accomplished by}} transmitting single-sideband with a normal or slightly reduced carrier. This mode is called compatible (or full-carrier) SSB or amplitude modulation equivalent (AME). In typical AME systems, harmonic distortion can reach 25%, and intermodulation distortion can be much higher than normal, but minimizing distortion in receivers with envelope detectors is generally considered less important than allowing them to produce intelligible audio.|$|E
25|$|In 1861, {{seven years}} after the {{official}} opening of Victoria's first railway, the Locomotive Engine Drivers' Association was formed {{in an attempt to}} <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> standards of employment for these skilled workers. Comprising roughly twenty members, the Association grew to include firemen in 1872, prompting a change of name to the Locomotive Engine Drivers & Firemens' Association. In October 1899 representatives of the Railway Locomotive Enginemen's Associations of New South Wales, South Australia Queensland and Victoria met in Melbourne and voted in favour of forming the Federated Railway Locomotive Enginemens' Association of Australia.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} few years in power Cosgrave's new {{government}} faced a number of problems. The government attempted {{to reduce the size of}} the National Army. During the civil war it had grown to over 55,000 men which, now that the civil war was over, was far too large and costly to <b>maintain.</b> <b>Some</b> army officers challenged the authority of the government to cut the size of the Army. The officers, mostly Pro-Treaty IRA men, were angry that the government was not doing enough to help to create a republic and also there would be massive unemployment.|$|E

25|$|With {{the conquest}} of the American mainland, Hispaniola quickly declined. Most Spanish colonists left for the silver-mines of Mexico and Peru, while new {{immigrants}} from Spain bypassed the island. Agriculture dwindled, new imports of slaves ceased, and white colonists, free blacks, and slaves alike lived in poverty, weakening the racial hierarchy and aiding intermixing, resulting in a population of predominantly mixed Spaniard, African, and Taíno descent. Except {{for the city of}} Santo Domingo, which managed to <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> legal exports, Dominican ports were forced to rely on contraband trade, which, along with livestock, became the sole source of livelihood for the island dwellers. In 1586, Sir Francis Drake captured the city of Santo Domingo, collecting a ransom for its return to Spanish rule.|$|E
25|$|One {{would expect}} that all {{simplified}} characters would simultaneously also be z-variants or semantic variants with their traditional counterparts, but many are neither. It is easier to explain the strange case that semantic variants can be simultaneously both semantic variants and specialized variants when Unicode's definition is that specialized semantic variants have the same meaning only in certain contexts. Languages use them differently. A pair whose characters are 100% drop-in replacements for each other in Japanese {{may not be so}} flexible in Chinese. Thus, any comprehensive merger of recommended codepoints would have to <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> variants that differ only slightly in appearance even if the meaning is 100% the same for all contexts in one language, because in another language the two characters may not be 100% drop-in replacements.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1954, at {{the time}} the Geneva Conference had concluded, Tuyến had been working for the anti-communist Vietnamese National Army of the State of Vietnam in an {{outlying}} province, only travelling to Hanoi during the weekends. As a result of the discussions in Geneva, Vietnam was to be temporarily partitioned pending national reunification elections in 1956. In the meantime, the Vietminh controlled the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the north, and the State of Vietnam was handed the south. The agreements also allowed for the free passage of civilians between either side for 300 days, while military personnel were obliged to move to their respective zones. Tuyến had persuaded a substantial number of northern Catholics to leave their homes and move south. As a result, he later tried to persuade Diệm to <b>maintain</b> <b>some</b> contact with members of the communist regime in Hanoi in the hope of persuading them to defect.|$|E
