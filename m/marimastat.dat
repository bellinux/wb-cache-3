50|$|<b>Marimastat</b> was a {{proposed}} antineoplastic drug developed by British Biotech. It {{acted as a}} broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor.|$|E
50|$|Subsequent {{investigations}} by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Food and Drug Administration, London Stock Exchange and the European Medicines Evaluation Agency {{found that}} British Biotech had wilfully misled {{the public about}} the progress of <b>marimastat</b> and that unblinding data before the end of clinical trials does not necessarily invalidate the results. <b>Marimastat</b> underwent Phase III trials in collaboration with Schering-Plough Corporation.Further development of zacutex was abandoned due to poor clinical trial results.|$|E
50|$|Some {{examples}} of exopeptidase inhibitors include amastatin, bestatin (ubenimex), puromycin, 1,10-phenanthroline, D-phenylalanine, ACE inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, and exogenous MMP inhibitors like batimastat and <b>marimastat.</b> Various enkephalinase inhibitors, such as ketalorphan, spinorphin, and tynorphin, are mainly exopeptidase inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, {{despite having}} no {{compounds}} {{on or near}} the market, the company was temporarily valued at nearly $2.5 billion, largely {{on the basis of its}} two main development drugs: <b>marimastat</b> (a novel matrix metalloprotease inhibitor for cancer treatment) and zacutex (for pancreatitis).|$|E
50|$|However, initial {{clinical}} trials using broad spectrum MMP inhibitors did show some positive results. Phase I {{clinical trials}} showed that MMP inhibitors are generally safe with minimal adverse side effects. Additionally, trials with <b>marimastat</b> did show {{a slight increase}} in survival of patients with gastric or pancreatic cancer.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} rationally {{designed}} MMP inhibitors have shown some promise {{in the treatment}} of pathologies that MMPs are suspected to be involved in (see above). However, most of these, such as <b>marimastat</b> (BB-2516), a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, and cipemastat (Ro 32-3555), an MMP-1 selective inhibitor, have performed poorly in clinical trials. The failure of <b>Marimastat</b> was partially responsible for the folding of British Biotech, which developed it. The failure of these drugs has been due largely to toxicity (in particular, musculo-skeletal toxicity in the case of broad spectrum inhibitors) and failure to show expected results (in the case of trocade, promising results in rabbit arthritis models were not replicated in human trials). The reasons behind the largely disappointing clinical results of MMP inhibitors is unclear, especially in light of their activity in animal models.|$|E
50|$|Batimastat was {{the first}} MMPI that went into {{clinical}} trials. First results of a Phase I trial appeared in 1994. The drug reached Phase III but was never marketed; mainly because it couldn't be administered orally (as opposed to the newer and chemically similar MMPI <b>marimastat),</b> and injection into the peritoneum caused peritonitis.|$|E
50|$|The {{pioneering}} hydroxamate-based inhibitors {{were followed}} {{by a set of}} 'new generation' molecules with features including a substituted aryl, a sulfonamide and a hydroxamate zinc-binding group.In MMI-270 there is also an amino acid sidechain-type substituent on the carbon that is α to the hydroxamate, along with a sidechain on the sulfonamide (which was later shown to be unnecessary). The N-arylsulfonyl-α-aminoacid hydroxamate of MMI-270 mimics the <b>marimastat</b> succinate motif. Cipemastat, which was developed as an MMP-1, -3 and -9 collagenase inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid- and osteo-arthritis, also has the <b>marimastat</b> succinate motif. Its clinical trial was terminated prematurely.MMI-166 has an N-arylsulfonyl-α-aminocarboxylate zinc-binding group, different from the hydroxamate-zinc binding group seen in MMI-270 and Cipemastat. It also has a triaryl substitution that the other structures didn‘t have. ABT-770 and Prinomastat also have an aryl substitution. In ABT-770 the two phenyl rings are directly connected but in Prinomastat the two phenyl rings are connected by an oxygen atom, forming a diphenylether. These three permutations direct the SAR away from MMP-1 and toward the „deep pocket“ MMPs such as the gelatinases. ABT-770 shows anticancer activity in animal models, but it is easily metabolised to an amine metabolite that causes phospholipidosis. MMI-166 has shown anticancer activity in numerous animal models, but there is no data available of its clinical performance. Prinomastat on the other hand, {{is one of the best}} studied MMP inhibitors. It showed excellent preclinical animal anticancer efficacy, but a recurring limitation to these hydroxamates (Prinomastat in particular) is drug metabolism including loss of the hydroxamate zinc-binding group.These inhibitors {{were followed by}} the next group of hydroxamate-based inhibitors, which focus on the suppression of metabolism, minimization of MMP-1 inhibitory activity and the control of subtype selectivity, by structure-based design. The tetrahydropyran in RS-130830 introduces a steric block that suppresses metabolism, which would fix the problem that the the previous generation of inhibitors showed. The outcome of its clinical evaluation has not yet been disclosed. 239796-97-5 has improved ADME and MMP-1 selectivity properties and has shown excellent oral efficacy in an animal model of osteoarthritis. Although, the therapeutic objectives for these inhibitors is not cancer, like it has been for most of the MMP inhibitors.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{generation}} of MMP inhibitors {{were based on the}} structure of the collagen molecule. In the design of these inhibitors, the basic protein backbone of collagen is maintained but the amide bond is replaced with a zinc-binding group. This group of inhibitors contain a hydroxamate (-CONHOH) group that binds the zinc atom in the active site of the MMP enzyme, therefore this group is called [...] "hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitors“. An example can be seen in <b>Marimastat,</b> a {{first generation}} inhibitor, which has a similar backbone and sidechain format to collagen.Ilomastat and batimastat were the first two MMP inhibitors to be tested in patients. These are both hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitors and have similar overall structures.The hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitors display an excellent anticancer activity in tumor cells but the clinical performances of these compounds were disappointing. A factor contributing to this disappointment was that they are broad-spectrum inhibitors of many MMP sub-types that can in many cases also inhibit members of the ADAMs protease family. When they were tested in patients they induced dose-limiting muscular and skeletal pain in a number of the patients. Only when the structures of the MMP inhibitors could be adjusted to impart selectivity and abolish toxicity, would they achieve clinical impact in cancer chemotherapy.|$|E

Recent advances in conventional chemotherapy and the development of novel ‘molecular’ treatment strategies with different toxicity profiles warrant investigation as combination treatment strategies. This randomised study in pancreatic cancer compares <b>marimastat</b> (orally administered matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor) in combination with gemcitabine to gemcitabine alone. Two hundred and thirty-nine patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer were randomised to receive gemcitabine (1000 [*]mg[*]m− 2) in combination with either <b>marimastat</b> or placebo. The primary end-point was survival. Objective tumour response and duration of response, time to treatment failure and disease progression, quality of life and safety were also assessed. There {{was no significant difference in}} survival between gemcitabine and <b>marimastat</b> and gemcitabine and placebo (P= 0. 95 log-rank test). Median survival times were 165. 5 and 164 days and 1 -year survival was 18 % and 17 % respectively. There were no significant differences in overall response rates (11 and 16 % respectively), progression-free survival (P= 0. 68 log-rank test) or time to treatment failure (P= 0. 70 log-rank test) between the treatment arms. The gemcitabine and <b>marimastat</b> combination was well tolerated with only 2. 5 % of patients withdrawn due to presumed <b>marimastat</b> toxicity. Grade 3 or 4 musculoskeletal toxicities were reported in only 4 % of the <b>marimastat</b> treated patients, although 59 % of <b>marimastat</b> treated patients reported some musculoskeletal events. The results of this study provide no evidence to support a combination of <b>marimastat</b> with gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

40|$|Background. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), tumor {{necrosis}} factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) are mediators {{of liver}} regeneration. To determine whether MMPs {{are required for}} normal hepatic regeneration, we performed 67 % hepatectomies on mice treated with a broad-spectrum MMP-inhibitor, and assessed the effect on liver regeneration and urinary AMP activity. Methods. Mice were subjected to sham operations, 67 % hepatectomy, or 67 % hepatectomy plus treatment with the broad-spectrum AMP inhibitor <b>Marimastat.</b> Urine collected preoperatively and for 8 d postoperatively was tested for MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 activity using zymography. Serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, TNF-alpha, IL- 6, and hepatocyte growth factor levels were measured. Liver sections were analyzed by CD 31 immunohistochemistry and microvessel density. Mitotic index and proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling index were determined. Results. The mean regenerating liver weight on postoperative day 8 was 0. 72 +/- 0. 01 grams for the hepatectomy <b>Marimastat</b> group, and 0. 83 +/- 0. 02 grams for the hepatectomy control group (P < 0. 001). Urinary MMP- 9 activity was elevated during hepatic regeneration, and decreased on postoperative day 8 when the liver returned to its preoperative mass. In contrast, urine from hepatectomy <b>Marimastat</b> mice, in which liver regeneration was successfully inhibited, showed consistently low levels of MMP- 2 and AMP- 9 activity. The hepatectomy <b>Marimastat</b> group also exhibited elevated serum IL- 6 levels on post-operative day 8, while serum TNF-alpha soluble receptor 11 levels were unchanged. Hepatocyte growth factor levels {{were not significantly different}} between the control hepatectomy and hepatectomy <b>Marimastat</b> groups at days 2, 4, and 8. Liver microvessel density was reduced in the hepatectomy <b>Marimastat</b> group at day 4. Mitotic index and proliferating cell nuclear antigen index were significantly decreased in the <b>Marimastat</b> hepatectomy group at post-operative day 2. Conclusions. The broad-spectrum AMP-inhibitor <b>Marimastat</b> inhibits liver regeneration. Microvessel density is reduced at day 4. Furthermore, urinary MMP- 9 is elevated during liver regeneration, and this effect is not observed when regeneration is inhibited by the broad-spectrum AMP-inhibitor <b>Marimastat.</b> (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Background - Inhibition of matrix {{metalloproteinase}} (MMP) activity after {{balloon angioplasty}} by intraperitoneal injection of batimastat reduces late lumen loss by inhibition of constrictive remodeling. In the present study, we investigated whether the oral MMP inhibitor <b>marimastat</b> inhibits constrictive remodeling {{in favor of}} neutral or expansive remodeling. Methods and Results - In 26 pigs, balloon dilation was performed in 101 peripheral arteries. Pigs were treated with <b>marimastat</b> or served as controls and were euthanized 42 days after intervention. Intravascular ultrasound was performed at all time points, Vessel area (VA) loss was assessed by calculating the change in VA at termination relative to after intervention. Arteries were divided in 3 categories: expansive remodeling (VA loss + 5 %). In the <b>marimastat</b> group, a significant reduction (53 %) of late lumen loss was observed that was fully explained by impaired constrictive remodeling. In the <b>marimastat</b> group, the prevalence of constrictive remodeling was reduced (38 % versus 75 % in the control group) in favor of not only neutral but also expansive remodeling (21 % and 42 % versus 4 % and 21 % in the control group, respectively, P< 0. 01). In contrast to the control group, acute luminal gain in the <b>marimastat</b> group did not correlate with late VA loss.

40|$|Background Liver {{fibrosis}} {{is characterized}} by excessive synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins, which prevails over their enzymatic degradation, primarily by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The effect of pharmacological MMP inhibition on fibrogenesis, however, is largely unexplored. Inflammation is considered a prerequisite and important co-contributor to fibrosis and is, in part, mediated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α-converting enzyme (TACE). We hypothesized that treatment with a broad-spectrum MMP and TACE-inhibitor (<b>Marimastat)</b> would ameliorate injury and inflammation, leading to decreased fibrogenesis during repeated hepatotoxin-induced liver injury. Methodology/Principal Findings Liver fibrosis was induced in mice by repeated carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) administration, during which the mice received either <b>Marimastat</b> or vehicle twice daily. A single dose of CCl 4 was administered to investigate acute liver injury in mice pretreated with <b>Marimastat,</b> mice deficient in Mmp 9, or mice deficient in both TNF-α receptors. Liver injury was quantified by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and confirmed by histology. Hepatic collagen was determined as hydroxyproline, and expression of fibrogenesis and fibrolysis-related transcripts was determined by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Marimastat-treated animals demonstrated significantly attenuated liver injury and inflammation but a 25 % increase in collagen deposition. Transcripts related to fibrogenesis were significantly less upregulated compared to vehicle-treated animals, while MMP expression and activity analysis revealed efficient pharmacologic MMP-inhibition and decreased fibrolysis following <b>Marimastat</b> treatment. <b>Marimastat</b> pre-treatment significantly attenuated liver injury following acute CCl 4 -administration, whereas Mmp 9 deficient animals demonstrated no protection. Mice deficient in both TNF-α receptors exhibited an 80 % reduction of serum ALT, confirming the hepatoprotective effects of <b>Marimastat</b> via the TNF-signaling pathway. Conclusions/Significance Inhibition of MMP and TACE activity with <b>Marimastat</b> during chronic CCl 4 administration counterbalanced any beneficial anti-inflammatory effect, resulting in a positive balance of collagen deposition. Since effective inhibition of MMPs accelerates fibrosis progression, MMP inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with chronic liver diseases...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMetalloproteinases (MMPs) {{and their}} {{endogenous}} inhibitors (TIMPs), {{produced in the}} brain by cells of non-neural and neural origin, including neural progenitors (NPs), are emerging as regulators of nervous system development and adult brain functions. In the present study, we explored whether MMP- 2, MMP- 9, and TIMP- 2, abundantly produced in the brain, modulate NP developmental properties. We found that treatment of NPs, isolated from the murine fetal cerebral cortex or adult subventricular zone, with the clinically tested broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor <b>Marimastat</b> profoundly affected the NP differentiation fate. <b>Marimastat</b> treatment allowed for an enrichment of our cultures in neuronal cells, inducing NPs to generate higher percentage of neurons and a lower percentage of astrocytes, possibly affecting NP commitment. Consistently with its proneurogenic effect, <b>Marimastat</b> early downregulated the expression of Notch target genes, such as Hes 1 and Hes 5. MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 profiling on proliferating and differentiating NPs revealed that MMP- 9 was not expressed under these conditions, whereas MMP- 2 increased in the medium as pro-MMP- 2 (72 [*]kDa) during differentiation; its active form (62 [*]kDa) was not detectable by gel zymography. MMP- 2 silencing or administration of recombinant active MMP- 2 demonstrated that MMP- 2 does not affect NP neuronal differentiation, nor it {{is involved in the}} <b>Marimastat</b> proneurogenic effect. We also found that TIMP- 2 is expressed in NPs and increases during late differentiation, mainly as a consequence of astrocyte generation. Endogenous TIMP- 2 did not modulate NP neurogenic potential; however, the proneurogenic action of <b>Marimastat</b> was mediated by TIMP- 2, as demonstrated by silencing experiments. In conclusion, our data exclude a major involvement of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 in the regulation of basal NP differentiation, but highlight the ability of TIMP- 2 to act as key effector of the proneurogenic response to an inducing stimulus such as <b>Marimastat...</b>|$|E
40|$|This randomised, double-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} {{study was}} designed to evaluate the ability of the orally administered matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, <b>marimastat,</b> to prolong survival in patients with non-resectable gastric and gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma.

Patients were treated for as long as was tolerable. The primary endpoint was overall survival with secondary endpoints of time to disease progression and quality of life. At the point of protocol-defined study completion (85 % mortality in the placebo arm) there was a modest difference in survival in the intention-to-treat population in favour of <b>marimastat</b> (P= 0. 07 log-rank test, hazard ratio= 1. 23 (95 % confidence interval 0. 98 – 1. 55)). This survival benefit was maintained over a further 2 years of follow-up (P= 0. 024, hazard ratio= 1. 27 (1. 03 – 1. 57)). The median survival was 138 days for placebo and 160 days for <b>marimastat,</b> with 2 -year survival of 3 % and 9 % respectively. A significant survival benefit was identified at study completion in the pre-defined sub-group of 123 patients who had received prior chemotherapy (P= 0. 045, hazard ratio= 1. 53 (1. 00 – 2. 34)). This benefit increased with 2 years additional follow-up (P= 0. 006, hazard ratio= 1. 68 (1. 16 – 2. 44)), with 2 -year survival of 5 % and 18 % respectively. Progression-free survival was also significantly longer for patients receiving <b>marimastat</b> compared to placebo (P= 0. 009, hazard ratio= 1. 32 (1. 07 – 1. 63)). <b>Marimastat</b> treatment was associated with the development of musculoskeletal pain and inflammation.

40|$|<b>Marimastat</b> is a {{specific}} inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases that {{has been shown to}} be effective in cancer models. A pilot, escalating-dose study of oral <b>marimastat</b> was performed in patients with recurrent colorectal cancer, in whom evaluation of serological response was made by measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. The study assessed the safety and tolerability of 4 weeks administration of <b>marimastat,</b> and determined a dose range producing detectable serological effects. Patients were recruited with a serum CEA level greater than 5 ng ml− 1, and rising by more than 25 % over a 4 -week screening period. Patients were treated for 28 days and entered into a continuation protocol if a serological response or clinical benefit was observed. Pharmacokinetic and safety data determined that groups of patients were recruited sequentially at 25 mg and 50 mg twice daily, and, thereafter, 10 mg twice daily, 10 mg once daily, 5 mg once daily and 20 mg once daily. A biological effect (BE) was defined as a CEA value on day 28 no greater than on day 0; a partial biological effect (PBE) was defined as a rise in CEA over the 28 -day treatment period of less than 25 %. Of 70 patients recruited, 63 completed the 28 -day treatment period, and 55 were eligible for cancer antigen analysis. Examination of the dose–effect relationships provides evidence for a causal relationship between <b>marimastat</b> and biological effects: the proportion of patients with BE or PBE was higher with twice daily dosing (16 out of 25, 64 %) than with once daily dosing (11 out of 30, 37 %) (P = 0. 043, χ 2 test). Furthermore, the median rates of rise of CEA fell markedly during treatment compared with the screening period for patients receiving twice daily <b>marimastat</b> (P < 0. 0001), but not for patients receiving <b>marimastat</b> once daily (P = 0. 25). Musculoskeletal adverse events emerged as the principal drug-related toxicity of <b>marimastat,</b> occurring in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. It was concluded that <b>marimastat</b> was associated with dose-dependent biological effects in cancer patients. The occurrence of musculoskeletal side-effects define 25 mg twice daily as the upper limit of the dose range for continuous use in further studies. Therefore, a dose range of 20 mg once daily to 25 mg twice daily seems appropriate for further studies, which should aim to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug in terms of conventional clinical end points and describe the long-term tolerability of this novel agent. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E
40|$|Inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is an {{attractive}} approach to adjuvant therapy {{in the treatment of}} cancer. <b>Marimastat</b> is the first orally administered, synthetic MMP inhibitor to be evaluated, in this capacity, in the clinic. Measurement of the rate of change of circulating tumour antigens was used for evaluating biological activity and defining optimum dosage in the early clinical trials of <b>marimastat.</b> Although tumour antigen levels have been used in the clinical management of cancer for many years, they have not been validated as markers of disease progression. In order to investigate the relationship between the effects of <b>marimastat</b> on tumour growth and circulating tumour antigen levels, mice bearing the human gastric tumour, MGLVA 1, were treated with <b>marimastat.</b> The MMP inhibitor exerted a significant therapeutic effect, reducing tumour growth rate by 48 % (P = 0. 0005), and increasing median survival from 19 to 30 days (P = 0. 0001). In addition, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were measured in serum samples from animals sacrificed at regular intervals, and correlated with excised tumour weight. It was shown that the natural log of the CEA concentration was linearly related to the natural log of the tumour weight and that treatment was not a significant factor in this relationship (P = 0. 7). In conclusion, circulating CEA levels were not directly affected by <b>marimastat,</b> but did reflect tumour size.

40|$|Steatosis is a {{prominent}} feature of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease {{and a potential}} promoter of inflammation. Injury leading to cirrhosis is partly mediated by dysregulation of matrix protein turnover. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors protect mice from lethal TNF-α induced liver injury. We hypothesized that <b>Marimastat,</b> a broad-spectrum MMP and TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE) inhibitor, might modulate this injury through interruption of inflammatory pathways. Triglyceride and phospholipid levels (liver, serum) and fatty acid profiles {{were used to assess}} essential fatty acid status and de novo lipogenesis as mechanisms for hepatic steatosis. Mice receiving a fat-free, high-carbohydrate diet (HCD) for 19 days developed severe fatty liver infiltration, demonstrated by histology, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and elevated liver function tests. Animals receiving HCD plus <b>Marimastat</b> (HCD+MAR) were comparable to control animals. Increased tissue levels of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), higher levels of serum IL- 6, and decreased levels of serum TNF-α receptor II were also seen in the HCD+MAR group compared with HCD-only. In addition, there was increased phosphorylation, and likely activation, of PPAR-α in the HCD+MAR group. PPAR-α is a transcription factor involved in β-oxidation of fatty acids, and IL- 6 is a hepatoprotective cytokine. Liver triglyceride levels were higher and serum triglyceride and phospholipid levels lower with HCD-only but improved with <b>Marimastat</b> treatment. HCD-only and HCD+MAR groups were essential fatty acid deficient and had elevated rates of de novo lipogenesis. We therefore conclude that <b>Marimastat</b> reduces liver triglyceride accumulation by increasing fat oxidation and/or liver clearance of triglycerides.

Inflammation is considered a prerequisite and important co-contributor to fibrosis and is, in part, mediated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -a-converting enzyme (TACE). We hypothesized that treatment with a broad-spectrum MMP and TACE-inhibitor (<b>Marimastat)</b> would ameliorate injury and inflammation, leading to decreased fibrogenesis during repeated hepatotoxin-induced liver injury. Methodology/Principal Findings: Liver fibrosis was induced in mice by repeated carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) administration, during which the mice received either <b>Marimastat</b> or vehicle twice daily. A single dose of CCl 4 was administered to investigate acute liver injury in mice pretreated with <b>Marimastat,</b> mice deficient in Mmp 9, or mice deficient in both TNF-a receptors. Liver injury was quantified by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and confirmed by histology. Hepatic collagen was determined as hydroxyproline, and expression of fibrogenesis and fibrolysis-related transcripts was determined by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Marimastat-treated animals demonstrated significantly attenuated liver injury and inflammation but a 25 % increase in collagen deposition. Transcripts related to fibrogenesis were significantly less upregulated compared to vehicle-treated animals, while MMP expression and activity analysis reveale...|$|E
40|$|For {{many years}} {{proof that the}} hypoxic nature of {{malignant}} tumours {{can be used to}} selectively target anticancer drugs has been sought. Several classes of potential redox activated anticancer drugs have been developed {{to take advantage of the}} reducing environment resulting from the hypoxia. Drug complexes with redox active metal centres as carriers have been investigated, but have largely been employed with cytotoxic drugs that require release of the drug intracellularly, complicating the design of such complexes. MMP inhibitors, a new class of anticancer drug, conversely act in the extracellular environment and we have investigated inhibitor complexes with several redox active transition metals. <b>Marimastat</b> is an MMP inhibitor with potent in-vitro antimetastatic activity and was recently in Phase III clinical trials for a variety of cancer types. We have synthesised a Co(II 1) complex of <b>marimastat</b> incorporating the tetradentate ligand tpa (tris(2 -methylpyridyl) amine) as a carrier ligand. The complex was structurally characterised in the solid state by single crystal X-ray diffraction, the first example of a crystal structure containing <b>marimastat.</b> 2 D COSY and NOESY NMR spectra showed that the complex exists in two isomeric forms in solution, corresponding to the cis and trans isomers yet only crystallises in one of these forms. Biological testing of the complex in mice with 4 T 1. 2 tumours showed interesting and unexpected outcomes. Initial results of the tumour growth inhibition study showed that a significant inhibition of growth was exhibited by the complex over the free inhibitor and the control. However, the metastatic potential of both free <b>marimastat</b> and the complex were higher than the control indicating likely problems with the experimental protocol. Further experiments are needed to determine the potential of such complexes as hypoxia activated prodrugs but there appears at least to be some promise...|$|E
40|$|Pancreatic {{cancer has}} a poor {{response}} to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase activity involved in tumour invasion and metastases {{is a novel}} biological approach for cancer treatment. This multicentre phase II clinical trial assessed <b>marimastat,</b> an oral matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. A total of 113 patients received <b>marimastat</b> for 28 days at 100  mg b. d. (n = 9), 25  mg o. d. (n = 90) or 10  mg b. d. (n = 14). Patients with a response to treatment could continue <b>marimastat</b> beyond 28 days. Of 113 patients, 90 (80 %) completed the 28 -day study and 83 (73 %) continued treatment. The principal side effect was arthralgia in 14 (12 %) patients at 28 days and 33 (29 %) patients over the whole study. There were 31 patients (27 %) who required dose modification. Of 76 patients with evaluable CA 19 - 9 levels, 23 (30 %) showed no increase or fall in CA 19 - 9. Of 83 patients with radiologically assessable disease, 41 (49 %) had stable disease. The median survival was 245 days for those with a stable or falling CA 19 - 9 level 128 days in those with rising CA 19 - 9. The overall survival was 3. 8 months. 5. 9 months for stage II, 4. 7 months for stage III and 3 months for stage IV disease. Of 90 patients, 46 (51 %) had stabilization or reduction in pain, mobility and analgesia scores.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{involvement}} of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) on dentin formation and mineralization, day 18 embryonic mouse tooth germs were cultured for 10 d in {{the presence or absence}} of <b>Marimastat,</b> a general MMP inhibitor, or CT(1166), a more selective inhibitor of gelatinases (MMP- 2 and MMP- 9) and stromelysin- 1 (MMP- 3). With <b>Marimastat</b> a dose-dependent increase in thickness of the predentin layer and a decreased mineralization of dentin were observed. At the highest concentration of the inhibitor used, enamel formation had ceased. With CT(1166), these effects were already apparent at the lowest concentration used. Western blot analyses demonstrated that the two inhibitors inhibited the expression of enamelysin (MMP- 20). These observations indicate that MMPs (possibly MMP- 2, - 3, - 9 and/or - 20) play a role in the onset of dentin mineralization. The lack of enamel formation was possibly due to diffusion of amelogenin from its normal site of apposition. The protein clearly was not retained at the surface of the non-mineralized dentin layer, and immunopositive amelogenin accumulated in the odontoblast compartment. The diffusion of enamel proteins and the accumulation revealed by immunolabeling of two small leucine-rich proteoglycans, decorin and biglycan, in the predentin may have contributed to impaired dentin mineralizatio...|$|E

40|$|The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are {{a family}} of zincdependent proteinases {{involved}} in the degradation of the extracellular matrix. The MMPs have been implicated in the processes of tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis; are frequently overexpressed in malignant tumors; and {{have been associated with}} an aggressive malignant phenotype and adverse prognosis in patients with cancer. A number of MMP inhibitors are being developed for the treatment of cancer. The most extensively studied class of MMP inhibitors includes collagen peptidomimetics and nonpeptidomimetic inhibitors of the MMP active site, tetracycline derivatives, and bisphosphonates. The hydroxamate peptidomimetic inhibitor batimastat and its orally bioavailable analogue <b>marimastat,</b> which bind covalently to the zinc atom at the MMP-active site, were the first MMP inhibitors to b...|$|E
40|$|Several inhibitors of {{a series}} of cis- 1 (S) 2 (R) -amino- 2 -indanol-based {{compounds}} were reported to be selective for the aggrecanases, ADAMTS- 4 and - 5 over other metalloproteases. To understand the nature of this selectivity for aggrecanases, the inhibitors, along with the broad spectrum metalloprotease inhibitor <b>marimastat,</b> were independently bound to the catalytic domain of ADAMTS- 5, and the corresponding crystal structures were determined. By comparing the structures, it was determined that the specificity of the relative inhibitors for ADAMTS- 5 was not driven by a specific interaction, such as zinc chelation, hydrogen bonding, or charge interactions, but rather by subtle and indirect factors, such as water bridging, ring rigidity, pocket size, and shape, as well as protein conformation flexibility...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: Migration and {{proliferation}} of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) contributes to intimal hyperplasia in saphenous vein (SV) bypass grafts, {{which leads to}} patency-threatening stenosis. Evidence for the involvement of basement membrane-degrading matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and growth factors in mediating SMC migration and proliferation has been presented {{in a number of}} in vitro and in vivo models. 3 -Hydroxy- 3 methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are widely used in patients with atherosclerosis and are claimed to have additional effects beyond cholesterol reduction. We therefore examined the effects of simvastatin, a commonly prescribed statin, on the proliferation and migration of cultured human SV SMC and on neointima formation and MMP activity in human SV organ cultures. To clarify its mode of action, we studied in parallel the effects of a specific MMP inhibitor, <b>marimastat.</b> Study Design: Human SV specimens were obtained from patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, and were cultured for 14 days in the presence of three concentrations of simvastatin and subsequently processed for measurement of MMP activity and neointimal thickness measurements. Cultured SV SMCs were used to construct growth curves in the presence of 10 % fetal calf serum or 10 % fetal calf serum supplemented with simvastatin or <b>marimastat.</b> Migration through a Matrigel basement-membrane matrix (invasion) was quantified with modified Boyden chambers. Results: Simvastatin dose dependently reduced neointima formation (P =. 004) in association with reduced MMP- 9 activity (P =. 03). SMC proliferation and invasion also were inhibited with simvastatin (P. 36). Conclusion: For effective control of neointimal development in vivo, a pharmacologic strategy should inhibit both SMC migration and proliferation. The ancillary properties of 3 -Hydroxy- 3 methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors typified by simvastatin may be important in this regard. (J Vasc Surg 2002; 36 : 150 - 7. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} intimal hyperplasia (IH) in vein bypass grafts and possible strategies to reduce it. Chapters 1 describes the clinical aspects of vein grafts and concentrates on their use in lower limb arterial reconstruction and coronary artery bypass grafts. Chapter 2 reviews the current understanding of the vascular biology of IH with particular emphasis on the roles of smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. The importance {{of the role of}} matrix metalloproteinases in the vascular wall is also described. Methods The following two chapters describe experimental methods. Chapter 3 reviews established experimental methods for the study of IH as established and practised in the department of surgery. Chapter 4 details the development of new techniques for the study of human venous smooth muscle cell migration. This starts with validation of the Boyden migration model with optimisation of parameters for human venous smooth muscle cells, followed by the development and validation of a laboratory model for migration through an extracellular matrix replicant called Matrigel. The final part of this chapter details the testing of a novel fluorescent labelling and automated counting technique for cell migration. The experimental models are then used in testing the compounds, doxycycline, <b>marimastat</b> and simvastatin, in relation to their effects on the processes of migration and proliferation. Results The results showed that Doxycycline affected chemoinvasion at all test doses and proliferation at higher doses but had no effect on simple migration. <b>Marimastat</b> was found to reduce chemoinvasion at higher doses, but not simple migration or proliferation at any of the three doses tested. Simvastatin affected chemoinvasion at all doses but did not affect simple migration or proliferation. In the final chapter, the results are summarised and possible future work arising from this thesis is discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProteases {{are crucial}} for cancer metastasis, {{but due to}} lack of assays, their role in intravasation has not yet been tested. We have {{developed}} a human Alu sequence PCR-based assay to quantitate intravasated cells in an in vivo model. We demonstrated that metalloproteinases (MMPs), and most likely MMP- 9, are required for intravasation by showing that <b>marimastat,</b> an inhibitor of MMPs, reduced intravasation by more than 90 %, and that only tumor cell lines expressing MMP- 9 intravasated. Cells with low surface urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and uPA receptor (uPAR) were also incapable of intravasation, despite the presence of high levels of MMP- 9. We concluded that breaching of the vascular wall is a rate-limiting step for intravasation, and consequently for metastasis, and that cooperation between uPA/uPAR and MMP- 9 is required to complete this step...|$|E
