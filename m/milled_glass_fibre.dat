Dispense equipment consists of material holding (day) tanks, metering pumps, a mix head, and a control unit.

It is essentially employed to recover a vast array of different valuable commodities such as rare earth minerals essential to the manufacture of high-tech products. Owing to its simplicity, the process is also widely used for the de-inking of recycled paper fibres and for the removal of pollutants from waste water. The flotation process essentially relies on the attachment of solid particles on the surface of gas bubbles immersed in water. The present study seeks to investigate the effect of the particle shape on the attachment mechanism. Using an in-house optical micro-bubble sensor the approach, the sliding and the adhesion of micron <b>milled</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> on the surface of a stationary air bubble immersed in stagnant water is thoroughly investigated. The translational and rotational velocities were measured for fibres of various aspect ratios. The results are compared with a theoretical model and with experimental data obtained with spherical glass beads. It is found that the fibre orientation during the sliding motion largely depends on the collision area. Upon collision near the upstream pole of the gas bubble the major axis of the fibre aligns with the local bubble surface (tangential fibre alignment). If collision occurs at least 30 ° further downstream only head of the fibre is in contact with the gas–liquid interface (radial fibre alignment) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Starting from epoxy based systems {{suited for}} high temperatures, {{different}} dispersed materials, like aluminium particles, <b>milled</b> carbon and <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> {{were added to}} the polymeric matrix for Rapid Tooling applications. Aluminium is intended to increase the thermal conductivity of the tool, while the milled fibres improve the wear resistance of the composite tool. In this communication mathematical models for mechanical behaviour of these epoxy matrix composites are discussed. The research is essentially focused on the elastic modulus, because the properties related with the material failure are difficult to analyse due to the complexity of the mechanism that controls the failure of polymer based composite materials. Halpin-Tsai-Nielsen and Halpin-Tsai models were applied to the particulate filled and fibre reinforced epoxy systems, respectively. A critical analysis of the mismatches detected between the experimental and the theoretical values allowed us to propose a semi-empirical model more suited to the results obtained.

Fibre length distribution (FLD), Fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) together with characterisation of thermal, dynamic mechanical and mechanical properties were carried out on moulded specimens. FLD analyses revealed that composites with relatively high <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> loading exhibited low number average fibre length (Ln) and weight average fibre length (Lw) values than those containing relatively low <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> content. Due {{to the presence of}} added functional groups, a difference in the FTIR spectra for treated and untreated nanoclay powder was observed. XRD analyses showed that the interaction between nanoclay and PP matrix resulted in the intercalation of the polymer chains, which increased the nanoclay interlayer distance, as the TEM micrographs showed intercalated morphologies. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the incorporation of untreated nanoclay into the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> composite improved the thermal stability of the material. Further enhancement of this property was observed with the presence of treated nanoclay. Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) study showed that the incorporation of untreated clay into <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> composite shifted the melting and crystallisation temperatures to higher values. Furthermore, the degree of crystallinity was strongly influenced by the presence of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> and nanoclay in the matrix. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) showed an increase in the storage modulus, indicating higher stiffness in case of the hybrid composites when compared to the clay nanocomposite, <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> composite and pure PP matrix. <b>Glass</b> <b>fibre</b> and nanoclay content showed a strong influence on the magnitude of tan δ. Incorporation of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> into the PP matrix reduced the tensile strength of the binary composites, indicating a poor fibre-matrix interfacial adhesion. However, by introducing the untreated nanoclay in the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> composite, the strength of the ternary hybrid composites increased. In addition, tensile modulus was enhanced with incorporation of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> and further increased with an introduction of untreated nanoclay.

For <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> composite and clay nanocomposite, the peak load (P) and critical stress intensity factor (Kc) increased with filler contents.

The lowest dose was 0. 04 x 10 (9) crocidolite fibres in 0. 5 mg dust, and the highest amounted to 20 x 10 (9) <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> in 1000 mg divided into 40 weekly injections. Two mesotheliomas were found in a total of 395 rats treated with saline or granular silicon carbide (250 or 1000 mg). Eleven fibre dusts produced dose-dependent mesotheliomas at rates of up to 97 %, but the calculated fibre number > 5 micrometers in length required for inducing a 25 % tumour risk differed between the fibre samples tested in the relation of 1 to about 1000. UICC-like crocidolite heads the ranking order; the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> B- 01, which possesses a low durability in the body, ends it together with a rather thin sample of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> type B- 09. The stone fibre MMVF- 21 takes a high place in the ranking order, similar to the tremolite sample. The results correspond to those of earlier i. p. tests...|$|R
