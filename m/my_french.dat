5|$|The {{gameplay}} of <b>My</b> <b>French</b> Coach and My Spanish Coach {{consists of}} the player completing lessons that introduce new vocabulary and then focus on mastering the words through several puzzle games. As the player progresses through the game, the words increase in difficulty. When first starting the game, the player takes an introductory test that gauges their initial comprehension level of the French or Spanish language. The player is then placed into a level reflective of the score they received on the test. A player who scores highly {{will be able to}} skip many of the initial levels and more basic concepts. When starting a lesson, the player is shown ten new words, which include nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs, as well as their meanings and proper enunciation.|$|E

500|$|<b>My</b> <b>French</b> Coach and My Spanish Coach {{were two}} of the first three games Ubisoft {{released}} for the My Coach series; the other game was My Word Coach. During the course of their development by Sensory Sweep Studios, the lessons and minigames were created with the help of French and Spanish language teachers. Ubisoft announced {{the creation of a new}} division to create the My Coach series on May 21, 2007, and that Pauline Jacquey, the producer of the Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon and Rayman series, would lead the division. When commenting on the direction of the My Coach series, Jacquey said that she was [...] "developing projects that make people feel that playing games is worth their while, allowing them to spend quality time with family and friends, learn a new skill, or improve their daily lives". Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot commented that, “The timing is right for us to leverage our creativity and to open up the video games market to new consumers who will be attracted by content that can help them learn, grow and feel better in an entertaining way". All three games were released on November 6, 2007 in North America. Ubisoft followed with a PlayStation Portable version of My Spanish Coach, releasing it in North America on October 7, 2008; Wii versions of <b>My</b> <b>French</b> Coach and My Spanish Coach were released in Europe on November 30, 2007.

500|$|<b>My</b> <b>French</b> Coach and My Spanish Coach have {{received}} generally favorable reviews from several video game publications. On Metacritic, a website that compiles scores from various video game reviews, My Spanish Coach received a 73/100, based on seven reviews. In {{a review of}} the DS versions of both games, IGN called them a [...] "great learning experience" [...] and a more entertaining alternative to traditional methods of learning French and Spanish such as [...] "ours of boring exercises and outdated videos". Eurogamer claimed the games were not substitutes for proper language lessons, but admitted that [...] "as tools for improving your language skills, whether you're starting from scratch or have some basic knowledge, they're great". In {{a review of the}} DS version of <b>My</b> <b>French</b> Coach, Nintendo World Report called the game [...] "not be the hottest game to ever sit in your DS, but it is an unusually polished product that achieves the edutainment holy grail – it makes learning easy and fun". During the 2007 Christmas holiday season, video game retailer GameStop recommended My Spanish Coach for [...] "The Academic Gamer". My Spanish Coach led all Nintendo DS games in sales during the week of August 15, 2008 to August 21, 2008.|$|E
500|$|In 1808, Champollion {{received}} a scare when French Archeologist Alexandre Lenoir published {{the first of}} his four volumes on Nouvelles Explications des Hieroglyphes. making the young scholar fear that his budding work had already been surpassed. But he was relieved to find that Lenoir still operated under the assumption that the hieroglyphs were mystic symbols and not a literary system expressing language. This experience made him even more determined {{to be the first to}} decipher the language and he began dedicating himself even more to the study of Coptic, writing in 1809 to his brother: [...] "I give myself up entirely to Coptic... I wish to know Egyptian like <b>my</b> <b>French,</b> because on that language will be based my great work on the Egyptian papyri." [...] That same year, he was appointed to his first academic post, in history and politics at the University of Grenoble.|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} received {{mixed reviews}} from critics. In {{a review of}} the PSP version of My Spanish Coach, IGN noted that acquiring mastery points in the minigames lead to [...] "quite a bit of grinding" [...] due to the game's repetitive structure. Nevertheless, IGN accepted that the repetition was an effective way to learn the vocabulary, and noted that [...] "icking up on things like gender and age, emphasis and the breakdowns of the actual language itself and proper/casual ways of conversing are made fairly clear and reinforced regularly". IGN's review of the DS versions of both games commented that neither game taught the future or past tense, calling it one of the [...] "most disappointing" [...] aspects of the game, but praised the effective incorporation of the DS stylus into the minigames. Eurogamer noted that the minigames were [...] "only really good for practicing reading" [...] {{due to a lack of}} games for practicing proper speaking, but GameZone disagreed, noting that the player was able to hear their attempt to speak the French or Spanish words alongside the correct pronunciation during lessons, and praised this aspect as the [...] "most interesting and intriguing feature of [...] ". In {{a review of the}} DS version of My Spanish Coach, Nintendo World Report lamented that many of the minigames [...] "exhibit the same type of unimaginative boringness" [...] and that [...] "it takes ages to unlock new lessons and mini-games"; however, it noted that the minigames were [...] "extremely effective" [...] and [...] "constructed extremely well" [...] in terms of teaching the language. Nintendo World Report's review of the DS version of <b>My</b> <b>French</b> Coach called the game's reference section [...] "a very handy travel dictionary", noting that having a dictionary list and a phrasebook with audio files that could bookmark chosen phrases was [...] "an absurd value".|$|E

However, he has repeatedly {{struggled to}} answer questions in French from journalists. Ban has repeatedly acknowledged his limitations at French, but assured French diplomats that he was devoted to continuing his study. At a press conference on 11 January 2007, Ban remarked, [...] "My French perhaps could be improved, and I am continuing to work. I have taken French lessons {{over the last few}} months.

2500|$|Corner Gas was {{promoted}} by CTV as the network's [...] "first original narrative comedy series." [...] While it is not, in fact, the first Canadian-produced sitcom ever aired on CTV, having been preceded by The Trouble with Tracy, Snow Job, Excuse <b>My</b> <b>French,</b> and Check It Out!, {{it is the}} first CTV sitcom in which the network itself has held a primary production role, rather than acting solely as a holder of broadcast rights, and the first to postdate the network's late-1990s corporate restructuring from a cooperative of its affiliated stations into a conventional corporation. Corner Gas can also be verifiably called the most successful of these shows.|$|E
