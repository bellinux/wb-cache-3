5|$|Since {{the tight}} control of enzyme {{activity}} {{is essential for}} homeostasis, any <b>malfunction</b> (mutation, overproduction, underproduction or deletion) of a single critical enzyme {{can lead to a}} genetic disease. The <b>malfunction</b> of just one type of enzyme out of the thousands of types present in the human body can be fatal. An example of a fatal genetic disease due to enzyme insufficiency is Tay-Sachs disease, in which patients lack the enzyme hexosaminidase.|$|E

5|$|On 15 November 1982, {{while on}} a {{training}} flight outside Kunsan Air Base in South Korea, USAF Captain Ted Harduvel died when he crashed inverted into a mountain ridge. In 1985, Harduvel's widow {{filed a lawsuit against}} General Dynamics claiming an electrical <b>malfunction,</b> not pilot error, as the cause; a jury awarded the plaintiff $3.4 million in damages. However, in 1989, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled the contractor had immunity to lawsuits, overturning the previous judgment. The court did remand the plaintiff's claim of electrical <b>malfunction</b> as the cause, noting that General Dynamics and the USAF knew about chafing of instrumentation wiring, which they had not initially disclosed. The accident and subsequent trial was the subject of the 1992 film Afterburn.|$|E

40|$|Several common {{elevator}} <b>malfunctions</b> {{were diagnosed}} with a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM). After acquiring vibration signals of various elevator functions, their energy characteristics and time domain indicators were extracted by theoretically analyzing the optimal wavelet packet, in order to construct a feature vector of <b>malfunctions</b> for identifying causes of the <b>malfunctions</b> as input of LS-SVM. Meanwhile, parameters about LS-SVM were optimized by K-fold cross validation (K-CV). After diagnosing deviated elevator guide rail, deviated shape of guide shoe, abnormal running of tractor, erroneous rope groove of traction sheave, deviated guide wheel, and tension of wire rope, the results suggested that the LS-SVM based on K-CV optimization was one of effective methods for diagnosing elevator <b>malfunctions...</b>|$|R
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 21 March 1941 a Fairey Fulmar from Ark Royal {{stumbled}} across Scharnhorst and Gneisenau at sea. Because of a radio <b>malfunction,</b> the crew {{had to return to}} Ark Royal to report, by which time the German ships had escaped under fog. The next day, Ark Royal re-established air patrols in the hope of re-locating the raiders. During the day, a catapult <b>malfunction</b> destroyed a Fairey Swordfish; flinging the fuselage into the sea ahead of the carrier. Unable to stop, Ark Royal ran over the Swordfish and was overhead when the aircraft's depth charges detonated. Scharnhorst and Gneisenau reached Brest without British harassment, while Ark Royal returned to Gibraltar for repairs, arriving on 24 March.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 3, the local weather station {{reported}} clear conditions due to a <b>malfunction,</b> while {{a thick layer of}} fog rolled onto the highway. Dozens of vehicles including several semi-trailers quickly crashed into each other shortly after 8a.m., one following another in the dense fog, and the accumulating wreckage caught traffic travelling in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|Several {{accidents}} occurred which {{threatened the}} station's safety, {{such as the}} glancing collision between Kristall and Soyuz TM-17 during proximity operations in January 1994. The three most alarming incidents occurred during EO-23. The first was on 23 February 1997 during the handover period from EO-22 to EO-23, when a <b>malfunction</b> occurred in the backup Vika system, a chemical oxygen generator later known as solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG). The Vika <b>malfunction</b> led to a fire which burned for around 90 seconds (according to official sources at the TsUP; astronaut Jerry Linenger insists the fire burned for around 14 minutes), and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don respirators, {{but some of the}} respirator masks initially worn were broken. Some of the fire extinguishers mounted {{on the walls of the}} newer modules were immovable.|$|E

5|$|Another company, Houser Vending Co., Inc., {{developed}} a French fry vending machine named Mr. Crispy's, {{which was used}} in various locations such as college campuses and factories since at least September 1990. The fries were cooked in 365°F sunflower oil for around 40 seconds, and 500 orders of fries were prepared before the oil was changed. The machine had a feature that automatically turned it off {{in the event of}} a <b>malfunction,</b> and it also had a fire extinguisher built into it.|$|E

Cancellara was one of the favourites to win the renewed Tour of Flanders but played no part in the final due to a crash in the feed zone. It was caused by a discarded water bottle. He suffered a four-part fracture of the right collarbone which ruined his spring campaign.|$|E

The MADREC (<b>Malfunction</b> Detection and Recording) upgrade fitted to most aircraft by 1965 could detect failures in avionics and weapons computer systems, and was essential in monitoring the Hound Dog missiles. The electronic countermeasures capability of the B-52 was expanded with Rivet Rambler (1971) and Rivet Ace (1973).|$|E
5|$|Salyut 6's {{propulsion}} system experienced a serious <b>malfunction</b> {{during the second}} crew residency in 1978 and was not usable again {{for the remainder of}} the station's lifespan. As a consequence, it was limited to firing its attitude control thrusters and visiting spacecraft had to perform orbital adjustments. After each crew residency ended, it was necessary for Progress and TKS spacecraft to boost the station into a high orbit so it wouldn't decay until the next residency began.|$|E
30|$|Indeed, initial <b>malfunctions</b> in the cyber layer do not {{directly}} cause {{failures in the}} physical layer. Few unobservable points will not cause any failure in the physical layer and the physical layer can operate normally until failures occur within the physical system. However, the observability and controllability situations in the physical layer deteriorate. Many actual blackout cases proposed in recent years correspond to the circumstance where both cyber <b>malfunctions</b> and physical incidents have occurred, {{although there is no}} direct relation between them. In the initial state, there are defects or <b>malfunctions</b> in the cyber layer, including software <b>malfunctions,</b> PMU <b>malfunctions,</b> and communication transmission failures. Then, cascading outages are triggered by coincidental failures or faults in the unobservable part of the physical layer. Defects in the cyber layer cause the situation to become increasingly unobservable and uncontrollable. As a result, no security controls are taken, which in turn allow the failure to propagate between the two layers and lead to blackouts. Although the possibility of this circumstance is really low, it can lead to catastrophic results. This paper focuses on this low possibility, but worst result circumstance. Therefore, in the initial failure, the <b>malfunctions</b> in the cyber nodes and the failures in their corresponding physical nodes are assumed to occur simultaneously.|$|R
