The electrode position was conducted for 30 minutes at 0. 004; 0. 008; 0. 010; 0. 012 and 0. 014 A. In the electrode position cell, SiO 2 -TiO 2 /Graphite was used as cathode and a graphite rod was used as anode. The weight of deposited Ag was analyzed gravimetrically. The current efficiency of electrode position was calculated by comparing its experimental weight to its theoretical weight founded from calculation using Faraday’s equation for electrolytic cell. Meanwhile, the photo electrochemical testing was carried out to investigate the efficiency of induced photon to current conversion; it was measured as %IPCE (% Induced Photon to Current Efficiency). The crystallinity and crystal structure of the prepared materials were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and their surface morphology was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). 	This research found that silver was deposited as silver metal, Ag and as silver oxide, AgO. The electrode position efficiency at applied current of 0. 014 A is 92. 30 % with diameter of cluster is 7 - 11. 9 mm. It is founded that Ag and AgO deposition enhanced the efficiency of photon conversion into current up to 89. 92 %. The optimum %IPCE value is at 28. 6 % of Ag content. Ag-SiO 2 -TiO 2 /G has higher photo conversion than Ag-TiO 2 /G, shown by the %IPCE value at 300 nm is 83. 25 % higher than Ag-TiO 2 /G.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} investigate {{two different}} magnetic tunneling junctions (MTJs) with semiconductor barriers, CuInSe_ 2 (CIS) and CuGaSe_ 2 (CGS), {{which are the}} terminal compounds of recently reported <b>mixed</b> <b>semiconductor</b> barrier, CuIn_ 1 -xGa_ xSe_ 2. To discuss the transport properties of these systems, we analyze complex band structures, magnetoresistance (MR) ratios, and resistance-area products (RA) by using first-principles based calculations {{in combination with the}} Landauer formula. It is found that the Δ_ 1 wave functions have dominant contributions to the spin-dependent tunneling transport in both CIS- and CGS-based MTJs. We also find that the CGS-based MTJ has a much larger MR ratio and slightly higher RA than those of the CIS-based MTJ, which indicates that a larger MR ratio is expected for a higher Ga concentration x in the CuIn_ 1 -xGa_xSe_ 2 -based MTJs. We further study the relationship between the band gaps in the barriers and MR ratios by changing the Coulomb repulsions in the Cu 3 d states of the CIS and CGS. It is shown that the barrier with a larger band gap yields a larger MR ratio. The comparison of MR ratios and RA between the CIS-, CGS-, and MgO-based MTJs are also given.

40|$|Detailed {{models of}} crystal growth have, {{for the most}} part, been limited to simple {{sublimation}} systems. These systems have little relevance to the complex chemical vapour transport systems used to produce modern semiconductors such as the III-V compounds, {{and the development of}} these systems has frequently been by trial and error. The work described in this thesis has attempted {{to bridge the gap between}} the crystal growth theories and technologically important growth systems. Crystal growth is a sequential process in which reactants are first transported to the surface of the growing crystal and then undergo a series of surface reactions. A major difficulty in investigating heterogeneous reaction kinetics is separating the two processes. In chapter 2 a formalism is developed which enables transport and surface kinetics to be uncoupled. The practical application of this is demonstrated in chapters 3 and 4 in which the sublimation of red phosphorus and the GaAs/HBr reaction are investigated using the modified entrainment method (MEM). The choice of experimental systems, and the depth to which they could be studied, was dictated largely by the interests of British Telecom. Consequently, the experimental work could only demonstrate the potential of MEM as a kinetic probe. More detailed examination of the dependence of the GaAs/HCl and GaAs/HBr reactions on reactant pressures has still to be carried out. The later chapters are concerned with the growth of the <b>mixed</b> <b>semiconductor</b> systems GalnAs and GalnAsP. These materials are required for the new generation of optical communications systems currently under development. Not only were the surface kinetics for these systems unknown, but even the transport equations for these systems had not been developed. Chapters 5 - 7 describe the development of a vapour phase system for the growth of these ternary and quaternary compounds. The basic principles are discussed for InP growth in chapter 5. Chapter 6 then develops thermodynamic and transport models for the mixed compounds and chapter 7 discusses the results obtained with practical growth system. Although many features of growth can be explained by the models developed in chapter 6, it is clear that a complete understanding of growth requires close study of the various processes occurring on the surface. <p...|$|E

40|$|Seeing {{macroscopic}} quantum states directly {{remains an}} elusive goal. Particles with boson symmetry can condense into such quantum fluids producing rich physical phenomena {{as well as}} proven potential for interferometric devices [1 - 10]. However direct imaging of such quantum states is only fleetingly possible in high-vacuum ultracold atomic condensates, and not in superconductors. Recent condensation of solid state polariton quasiparticles, built from <b>mixing</b> <b>semiconductor</b> excitons with microcavity photons, offers monolithic devices capable of supporting room temperature quantum states [11 - 14] that exhibit superfluid behaviour [15, 16]. Here we use microcavities on a semiconductor chip supporting two-dimensional polariton condensates to directly visualise {{the formation of a}} spontaneously oscillating quantum fluid. This system is created on the fly by injecting polaritons at two or more spatially-separated pump spots. Although oscillating at tuneable THz-scale frequencies, a simple optical microscope can be used to directly image their stable archetypal quantum oscillator wavefunctions in real space. The self-repulsion of polaritons provides a solid state quasiparticle that is so nonlinear as to modify its own potential.

Measurements of four-wave <b>mixing</b> in various <b>semiconductor</b> traveling-wave amplifiers were performed for detuning frequencies as large as 1. 7 THz. Ultrafast intraband mechanisms having relaxation time constants of 650 fs, in agreement with dynamic carrier heating, and of less than 100 fs, in agreement with intraband carrier-carrier scattering, were determined in the measurements. A novel cross-polarized four-wave mixing technique was also developed to study the inter quantum well carrier transport process in quantum well amplifiers. A semiconductor optical amplifier having a structure of alternating tensile and compressively strained quantum wells was used. Polarization selection rule of the strained quantum wells enables selective excitation and probing of adjacent quantum wells according to polarization, thereby enabling study of inter-well carrier transport. A one-dimensional diffusion model was developed to illustrate the different transport efficiencies for carrier number and temperature modulations, thereby qualitatively explaining the experimental data.
