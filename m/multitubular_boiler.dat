50|$|A {{vertical}} fire-tube boiler or vertical <b>multitubular</b> <b>boiler</b> is {{a vertical}} boiler where the heating surface {{is composed of}} multiple small fire-tubes, arranged vertically.|$|E
50|$|A launch-type, gunboat or {{horizontal}} <b>multitubular</b> <b>boiler</b> {{is a form}} {{of small}} steam boiler. It consists of a cylindrical horizontal shell with a cylindrical furnace and fire-tubes within this.|$|E

25|$|It {{seems likely}} that in 1808 James {{attended}} the demonstration running of Richard Trevithick’s steam locomotive Catch me who can in London; certainly at this time he began to consider the long-term development of this means of transport, although he recognised that something more durable than cast iron would be needed for the rails themselves. For example, {{at the time of}} the Napoleonic Wars of 1815, he wrote to the Prince Regent proposing a railway link between the two principal naval dockyards at Chatham and Portsmouth which in peacetime could be used for passenger traffic; and in 1820/21 he promoted a Central Junction Railway from Stratford-upon-Avon to Paddington in London. In 1821 he made several trips to inspect railway developments in the Northumberland coalfield and met George Stephenson of Killingworth Colliery, his son Robert and the ironfounder William Losh. This resulted in an agreement for James to market the Stephenson/Losh patent locomotive (which James branded as the Land-Agent type) in England south of the Humber-Mersey line, with a supplementary agreement for Stephenson and Losh to use the patent for <b>multitubular</b> locomotive <b>boilers</b> taken out by William Henry James, William James’s son.|$|R
50|$|A solitary <b>multitubular</b> <b>boiler</b> with no {{distinguishing}} marks, lies in bushes about 150 metres {{from the}} main shaft. The key measurements are: diameter 1.7 metres; length 4.06 metres; central valve 850mm high x 750 mm; and 41 tubes in 7 rows (11 x 1, 4 x 2, 3 x 2, 3 x 2, 2 x 2, 2 x 2, and 1 x 2).|$|E
50|$|Liverpool {{combined}} near-horizontal inside cylinders with a <b>multitubular</b> <b>boiler</b> and a round, dome-topped firebox, {{mounted on}} a simple wrought-iron bar-frame inside the wheels, rather than wooden outside frames and inside iron sub-frames. This was a well thought-out and advanced design, which lasted. Most subsequent Bury locomotives followed this same basic design, which was copied by other firms, in Europe and the U.S.A.|$|E
50|$|The {{mine was}} {{serviced}} by the rail link from Almaden {{and there is}} limited evidence of the line between Einasleigh railway station and the mine itself. This {{is due to a}} combination of events: removal of the rail track, the construction of an airstrip at some stage west of the mine, frequent grass fires and souveniring of the sleepers. However, a trail of dog spikes once used to secure the line is discernible along part of the east west access that presently passes the isolated <b>multitubular</b> <b>boiler.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} at {{the time}} employed either a single flue boiler or a single return flue, with the fire grate {{at one end of}} the flue. For boilers of this design the blast of a contracted orifice blastpipe was too strong, and would lift the fire. It was not until the development of the <b>multitubular</b> <b>boiler</b> that the centrally positioned, contracted orifice blastpipe became standard. The combination of multi-tube boiler and steam blast are often cited as the principal reasons for the high performance of Rocket of 1829 at the Rainhill Trials.|$|E

40|$|Citation: Richards, H. P. Design of a 75 H. P. A. S. M. E. {{standard}} <b>multitubular</b> <b>boiler.</b> Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1902. Introduction: Design for a 75 H. P. (A. S. M. E. standard) horizontal <b>multitubular</b> <b>boiler.</b> Working pressure if {{100 pounds}} per sq. inch. Test pressure is 150 pounds per sq. inch. Length of tubes, 15 feet {{which is not}} to exceed 60 diameter the heating surface to be about 37 times the grate surface; the steam space about one-half the water space; and the tube area between one-seventh and one-eighth the grate area. The boiler is to be supplied with two steam outlets for five inch pipes, a hand hole four by six inches (4 ” x 6 ”) at the bottom of each tube sheet, and a man hold eleven by fifteen inches (11 ” x 15 ”) inside. Provisions are also to be made for the attachment of a one and one-fourth (1 - 1 / 4 ”) inch feed pipe and a two (2 ”) inch blow off pipe. The reach of the riveting machine is sex feet, six inches (6 ’ – 6 ”) ...|$|E
