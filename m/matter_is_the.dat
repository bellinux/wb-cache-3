25|$|One {{approach}} to resolving this problem {{relies on the}} fact that a living body is constantly losing old matter and gaining new matter. A five-year-old body consists of different matter than does the same person's seventy-year-old body. If the five-year-old body and the seventy-year-old body consist of different matter, then what makes them the same body? The answer is presumably the soul. Because the five-year-old body and the seventy-year-old body share a soul—that is, the person's life—we can identify them both as the body. Apart from the soul, we cannot identify what collection of <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> body. Therefore, a person's body is no longer that person's body after it dies.|$|E
25|$|Complicating the <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{ability of}} cattle to interbreed with other closely related species. Hybrid {{individuals}} and even breeds exist, not only between taurine cattle and zebu (such as the sanga cattle, Bos taurus africanus), but also between {{one or both}} of these and some other members of the genus Bosyaks (the dzo or yattle), banteng, and gaur. Hybrids such as the beefalo breed can even occur between taurine cattle and either species of bison, leading some authors to consider them part of the genus Bos, as well. The hybrid origin of some types may not be obvious – for example, genetic testing of the Dwarf Lulu breed, the only taurine-type cattle in Nepal, found them to be a mix of taurine cattle, zebu, and yak. However, cattle cannot be successfully hybridized with more distantly related bovines such as water buffalo or African buffalo.|$|E

25|$|Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita {{school and}} Shankara's Advaita school are both nondualism Vedanta schools, both are {{premised on the}} {{assumption}} that all souls can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation; in contrast, Madhvacharya and his Dvaita subschool of Vedanta believed that some souls are eternally doomed and damned. Shankara's theory posits that only Brahman and causes are metaphysical unchanging reality, while the empirical world (Maya) and observed effects are changing, illusive and of relative existence. Spiritual liberation to Shankara is the full comprehension and realization of oneness of one's unchanging Atman (soul) as the same as Atman in everyone else as well as being identical to the nirguna Brahman. In contrast, Ramanuja's theory posits both Brahman and the world of matter are two different absolutes, both metaphysically real, neither should be called false or illusive, and saguna Brahman with attributes is also real. God, like man, states Ramanuja, has both soul and body, and all of the world of <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> glory of God's body. The path to Brahman (Vishnu), asserted Ramanuja, is devotion to godliness and constant remembrance of the beauty and love of personal god (saguna Brahman, Vishnu), one which ultimately leads one to the oneness with nirguna Brahman.|$|E

500|$|One night, Mr. Nutt is fatally {{attacked}} by a creature. The agents eventually discover that the attacker is Lanny's twin, Leonard, {{who is able to}} detach himself from Lanny's body. According to Lanny, Leonard attacks people and attempts to burrow into them because he is looking for a new brother to replace Lanny, who is dying from liver failure due to years of alcohol abuse. Lanny voluntarily locks himself in the local jail {{in an effort to keep}} Leonard from escaping, but dies during the night, and Leonard is able to slip through the bars on the cell window and flee. Mulder and Scully try to capture Leonard, who goes inside a funhouse, but he manages to get away. Upon leaving the funhouse, they find The Conundrum lying on the ground, rubbing his stomach, apparently having eaten Leonard. As Dr. Blockhead prepares to leave town with The Conundrum the following morning, he comments to Scully that with modern science eradicating genetic anomalies, it will be up to self-made freaks like him to remind people that [...] "nature abhors normality." [...] The Conundrum looks unwell and Mulder asks what the <b>matter</b> <b>is.</b> <b>The</b> Conundrum [...] in his only line of the episode [...] replies, [...] "probably something I ate." [...] As Dr. Blockhead drives away with The Conundrum, Mulder and Scully turn to each other with confused and somewhat shocked expressions.|$|E

500|$|There {{are various}} names for this {{topographic}} feature. The Metacomet Ridge {{is described by}} some sources as a traprock ridge beginning on the Holyoke Range in Belchertown, Massachusetts, and ending at the Hanging Hills in Meriden, Connecticut. A 2004 report conducted for the National Park Service extends that definition to include the entire traprock ridgeline from Greenfield, Massachusetts, to Long Island Sound. The Sierra Club has referred to the entire range in Connecticut as [...] "The Traprock Ridge". Geologically and visually, the traprock ridgeline exists as one continuous landscape feature from Belchertown, Massachusetts, to Branford, Connecticut at Long Island Sound, a distance of , {{broken only by the}} river gorges of the Farmington River in northern Connecticut and the Westfield and Connecticut Rivers in Massachusetts. [...] Until January 2008, the United States Board on Geographic Names (USBGN) did not recognize Metacomet Ridge, Traprock Ridge or any other name, although several sub-ranges were identified. Geologists usually refer to the overall range generically as [...] "the traprock ridge" [...] or [...] "the traprock mountains" [...] or refer to it with regard to its prehistoric geologic significance in technical terms. Further complicating the <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fact that traprock only accounts for the highest surface layers of rock strata on the southern three–fourths of the range; an underlying geology of related sedimentary rock is also a part {{of the structure of the}} ridge; in north central Massachusetts it becomes the dominant strata and extends the range geologically from the Holyoke Range another [...] through Greenfield to nearly the Vermont border. This article describes the entire Metacomet Ridge and all geologic extensions of it.|$|E
500|$|Madhayamaka Buddhism goes even further, finding {{fault with}} the monist view of physicalist philosophies of mind {{as well in}} that these {{generally}} posit matter and energy as the fundamental substance of reality. [...] Nonetheless, this {{does not imply that}} the cartesian dualist view is correct, rather Madhyamaka regards as error any affirming view of a fundamental substance to reality.In denying the independent self-existence of all the phenomena that make up the world of our experience, the Madhyamaka view departs from both the substance dualism of Descartes and the substance monism—namely, physicalism—that is characteristic of modern science. The physicalism propounded by many contemporary scientists seems to assert that the real world is composed of physical things-in-themselves, while all mental phenomena are regarded as mere appearances, devoid of any reality in and of themselves. Much is made of this difference between appearances and reality.Indeed, physicalism or the idea that <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only fundamental substance of reality is explicitly rejected by Buddhism.In the Madhyamaka view, mental events are no more or less real than physical events. In terms of our common-sense experience, differences of kind do exist between physical and mental phenomena. While the former commonly have mass, location, velocity, shape, size, and numerous other physical attributes, these are not generally characteristic of mental phenomena. For example, we do not commonly conceive of the feeling of affection for another person as having mass or location. These physical attributes are no more appropriate to other mental events such as sadness, a recalled image from one’s childhood, the visual perception of a rose, or consciousness of any sort. Mental phenomena are, therefore, not regarded as being physical, {{for the simple reason that}} they lack many of the attributes that are uniquely characteristic of physical phenomena. Thus, Buddhism has never adopted the physicalist principle that regards only physical things as real.|$|E
