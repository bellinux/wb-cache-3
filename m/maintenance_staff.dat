5|$|On 22 March 2016, 2 SMRT {{maintenance}} trainees {{were run}} over {{and killed by}} an oncoming C151 train (trainset 073/074) reportedly travelling at 60km/h, 150 metres from Pasir Ris MRT Station, at approximately 11.10 am. The <b>maintenance</b> <b>staff</b> were a group of 15 personnel tasked to investigate a possible signalling system fault on the tracks near the Pasir Ris MRT Station. This incident had led to a 2.5 hour train service disruption and at least 10,000 commuters were affected.|$|E
5|$|In July 1904, The Judd School {{participated in}} the Pupil Teachers Scheme on an {{experimental}} basis. Established in the 1902 Education Act, students would receive a normal secondary education, before receiving two years training, splitting their time between a Pupil Teachers Centre and practical experience at elementary and secondary schools. The experiment was dropped soon after the First World War. When the school became grant earning in 1919, the additional funds meant teachers received pensions under the School Teachers' Superannuation Act of 1918. In 1970, 31 staff taught 463 boys; 45 taught 745 in 1988. According to the 2009 school prospectus, there are 71 teaching staff, 20 visiting music staff and 36 additional support, administration and <b>maintenance</b> <b>staff.</b>|$|E
5|$|The use of sleeve {{valves and}} oil baths to {{lubricate}} {{the moving parts}} of the engine units was inspired by contemporary internal combustion engine practice. This included oscillating gear that gave a 25-degree axial movement to the sleeves, allowing even lubrication of the moving parts. However, this resulted in an over-complicated mechanism that was difficult to maintain, perpetuating the seizures {{it was meant to}} eradicate. This feature was removed from both bogies of the prototype as the trials progressed. Another innovative feature of the steam bogie assembly was the ability to interchange them when faults occurred, an easy operation for <b>maintenance</b> <b>staff</b> when compared to the complexities of overhauling a regular steam locomotive's motion.|$|E

5|$|On 4 July 1906, Wörth was {{transferred}} to the Reserve Formation of the North Sea. She initially served as the flagship of the unit, but on 1 October she was replaced by Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm. She was then decommissioned and her crew reduced to only a <b>maintenance</b> <b>staff.</b> Over the next eight years, she was reactivated only twice, from 2 August to 13 September in 1910 and from 31 July to 15 September the following year; both periods were during the annual autumn maneuvers. She served with the III Squadron in both exercises, and was the flagship of the second command admiral for the squadron, Konteradmiral Heinrich Sass. She returned to reserve status on 15 September, and a month later was docked in the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel to maintain her for future service.|$|E

5000|$|Human Resource Management {{has four}} basic functions: staffing, {{training}} and development, motivation and <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Staffing</b> is the recruitment and selection of potential employees, done through interviewing, applications, networking, etc. Training and {{development is the}} next step in a continuous process of training and developing competent and adapted employees. Motivation is key to keeping employees highly productive. This function can include employee benefits, performance appraisals and rewards. The last function of maintenance involves keeping the employees' commitment and loyalty to the organization.|$|R

50|$|After {{the three}} bridges were completed, {{they were left}} closed to allow road and rail traffic to pass, but never opened for marine traffic. The {{northern}} approach to the High Street Bridge was destroyed by a fire in May 1909, which also damaged the bridge; repairs were performed late in 1909. After pressure was applied by Senator George Clement Perkins and Congressman Joseph R. Knowland, the federal government turned the bridges over to Alameda County in 1910, conditioned on the county assuming responsibility for <b>maintenance,</b> <b>staffing,</b> and operation.|$|R

WAM is also capable of collecting 4-20mA process signals, for process data like temperature, pressure, and speed through the proximity probes and transmitting these wirelessly via a long range spread spectrum 900 MHz radio to the 'Pathfinder' software {{residing in the}} user's maintenance station PC.|$|R

50|$|The Massachusetts Line was {{the name}} given to those units within the Continental Army that were {{assigned}} to Massachusetts at various times by the Continental Congress during the American Revolutionary War. These, together with similar contingents from the other twelve states, formed the Continental Line. Line regiments were assigned to a particular state, which was then financially responsible for the <b>maintenance</b> (<b>staffing</b> and supplying) of the regiment. The concept of the line was also particularly important {{in relation to the}} promotion of commissioned officers. Officers of the Continental Army below the rank of brigadier general were ordinarily ineligible for promotion except in the line of their own state.|$|R

25|$|The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) has {{operated}} {{a total of}} 40 C90 and C90A King Airs, with deliveries beginning in 1973. These have been given various designations by the JMSDF and consist of 34 TC-90 trainers, five LC-90 transports and a single UC-90 which is configured for photographic aerial survey. The TC-90s and the UC-90 comprise the 202nd Naval Air Training Squadron (JMSDF) based at Tokushima Air Base, while the LC-90s are attached to various Lockheed P-3 Kokutai (Squadrons) and a Air Transport Squadron 61 as liaison aircraft.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} hilarious true stories that demonstrate how easy it often is to save huge amounts of energy by relatively small and simple operating changes. The savings {{in most of these}} stories were documented by seeing the actual electric and gas bills go down. All of the situations were apparently invisible to the building operating and <b>maintenance</b> <b>staffs,</b> but readily apparent to the severely trained energy engineer. Stories also include a few where a well meaning, but misunderstanding, operating person inadvertently defeated ?the best laid plans of mice and men? resulting in huge extra costs on the energy bills. The series of stories illustrates the importance of actually going out to look at the equipment using the energy and talking to the actual people operating them...|$|R
