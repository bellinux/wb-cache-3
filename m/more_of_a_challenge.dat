5|$|In the United States, initial {{support to}} develop {{alternative}} fuels {{by the government}} was also {{a response to the}} first oil crisis, and some time later, as a goal to improve air quality. Also, liquid fuels were preferred over gaseous fuels not only because they have a better volumetric energy density but also because they were the most compatible fuels with existing distribution systems and engines, thus avoiding a big departure from the existing technologies and taking advantage of the vehicle and the refueling infrastructure. California led the search of sustainable alternatives with interest focused in methanol. Ford Motor Company and other automakers responded to California's request for vehicles that run on methanol. In 1981, Ford delivered 40 dedicated methanol fuel (M100) Escorts to Los Angeles County, but only four refueling stations were installed. The biggest challenge in the development of alcohol vehicle technology was getting all of the fuel system materials compatible with the higher chemical reactivity of the fuel. Methanol was even <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> than ethanol but much of the early experience gained with neat ethanol vehicle production in Brazil was transferable to methanol. The success of this small experimental fleet of M100s led California to request more of these vehicles, mainly for government fleets. In 1983, Ford built 582 M100 vehicles; 501 went to California, and the remaining to New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Work on the {{plutonium}} core {{had to wait}} until Windscale delivered sufficient product, which was not until late 1951. The uranium tamper proved <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> for the metallurgists than anticipated, due to a shortage of machine tools and moulds, and difficulty with the vacuum furnace. The first spheres were cast in December 1951, and while they were spherical to within , there were some casting defects, and it was feared they would hinder the implosion process. The defects were repaired, and two castings were prepared for Operation Hurricane. Work on plutonium chemistry and metallurgy was carried out at Harwell, as the hot laboratory at Aldermaston was not completed until May 1952. The first plutonium billet was cast there from plutonium nitrate from the Chalk River Laboratories in 1951. The metallurgists chose to alloy {{the plutonium}} with gallium to stabilise it in the malleable δ phase allotrope. Not until the first billet arrived from Harwell in 1951 were they able to confirm that this was practical. The first plutonium at Aldermaston was cast in an argon atmosphere in a cerium sulphide crucible.|$|E

Malignant pleural mesothelioma presenting without effusion however is <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diagnostic <b>challenge.</b> In this study we report the diagnostic yield and complications of ultrasound-guided cutting needle biopsies in this particular category <b>of</b> patients. Methods: <b>A</b> retrospective database analysis from September 2007 until January 2012 was performed in 56 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Clinical characteristics and results of diagnostic evaluations were analysed. Results: Of the 56 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, 20 patients presented without pleural effusion of with locular effusion. Ultrasound-guided cutting needle biopsy was performed in 14 / 20 patients with <b>a</b> diagnostic accuracy <b>of</b> 80 %. Only 1 patient had mild haemoptysis immediately following biopsies. Conclusion: Diagnosing patients with pleural thickenings suspect for malignant mesothelioma without pleural effusion or with loculated pleural effusion is effective and safe with ultrasound-guided cutting needle biopsies.

40|$|Interest {{in the use}} of {{alternative}} fuels and combustion regimes is increasing as the price of petroleum climbs. The inherently higher efficiency of Diesel engines has led to increased adoption of Diesels in Europe, capturing approximately 40 % of the new passenger car market. Unfortunately, lower CO{sub 2 } emissions are countered with higher nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions, and higher noise. Noise and PM have traditionally been the obstacles toward consumer acceptance of Diesel passenger cars in North America, while NOx (a key component in photochemical smog) has been <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> engineering <b>challenge.</b> Diesels are lean burning (combustion with excess oxygen) and reducing NOx to N 2 in an oxygen rich environment is difficult. Adding oxygenated compounds to the fuel helps reduce PM emissions, but relying on fuel alone to reduce PM is unrealistic. Keeping peak combustion temperature below 1700 K prevents NOx formation. Altering the combustion regime to burn at temperatures below the NOx threshold and accept <b>a</b> wide variety <b>of</b> fuels seems like a promising alternative for future engines. Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) is a possible solution. Fuel and air are well mixed prior to intake into a cylinder (homogeneous charge) and ignition occurs by compression of the fuel-air mixture by the piston. HCCI is rapid and relatively cool, producing little NOx and PM. Unfortunately, it is hard to control since HCCI is initiated by temperature and pressure instead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spark or direct fuel injection. We investigate biofuel HCCI combustion, and use intrinsically labeled biofuels as tracers of HCCI combustion. Data from tracer experiments are used to validate combustion modeling...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThe cardiac {{workload}} {{associated with}} {{various types of}} aortic obstruction was determined using computational fluid dynamic simulations. MethodsComputed tomography image {{data were collected from}} 4 patients with 4 distinct types of aortic arch obstructions and 4 controls. The categorization of arch hypoplasia corresponded to the “A, B, C” nomenclature <b>of</b> arch interruption; <b>a</b> type “D” was added to represent diffuse arch hypoplasia. Measurements of the vessel diameter were compared against the normal measurements to determine the degree of narrowing. Three-dimensional models were created for each patient, and additional models were created for type A and B hypoplasia to represent 25 %, 50 %, and 75 % diameter narrowing. The boundary conditions for the computational simulations were chosen to achieve realistic flow and pressures in the control cases. The simulations were then repeated after changing the boundary conditions to represent <b>a</b> range <b>of</b> cardiac and vascular adaptations. The resulting cardiac workload was compared with the control cases. ResultsOf the 4 patients investigated, 1 had aortic coarctation and 3 had aortic hypoplasia. The cardiac workload of the patients with 25 % narrowing type A and B hypoplasia was not appreciably {{different from that of the}} control. When comparing the different arch obstructions, 75 % type A, 50 % type B, and 50 % type D hypoplasia required a greater workload increase than 75 % coarctation. ConclusionsThe present study has determined the hemodynamic significance of aortic arch obstruction using computational simulations to calculate the cardiac workload. These results suggest that all types <b>of</b> hypoplasia pose <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> workload <b>challenge</b> than coarctation with <b>an</b> equivalent degree <b>of</b> narrowing...|$|R

While localized disease can be effectively treated/managed though radical prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy, disseminated disease represents much <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> clinical <b>challenge.</b> Through nearly <b>a</b> century <b>of</b> research, the androgen receptor (a ligand dependent nuclear receptor) {{has been identified as}} <b>a</b> critical driver <b>of</b> tumor development and progression at all stages <b>of</b> disease. <b>As</b> such, targeted inhibition of this pathway {{represents the}} most effective method to thwart progression of advanced and metastatic disease. While multiple therapeutics options have been developed to target this critical signaling node (ranging from systemic hormonal therapy, to direct antagonism of AR itself), tumors resistant to this class of therapy ultimately arise, with no form of durable treatment available at this stage. Consequently, a concerted effort has been put forth to understand the molecular underpinnings of the AR signaling pathway and collaborative networks which contribute to advanced disease phenotypes and therapeutic resistance. Work herein will describe the cross talk between the pro-oncogenic nuclear receptor cofactor Cyclin D 1 b, and AR driven networks that cooperate to promote advanced tumor phenotypes in prostate cancer, and describe the functional consequences of the switch to Cyclin D 1 b on development, tumor formation, and therapeutic response. Collectively, these studies utilized models derived from cell culture systems, subcutaneous xenografts, and a novel knock-in murine line. Techniques encompassing, biochemistry, molecular biology, histology, pathology, pharmacology, and genetics were utilized to interrogate the stated hypotheses. Utilizing data collected, it will be concluded that Cyclin D 1 b induction is associated with markers of cellular stress, functions in concert with AR driven networks to drive advanced tumor phenotypes, and unmasks novel therapeutic options to treat and manage tumors harboring this disease specific isoform. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAtmospheric {{chemistry}} and air-quality numerical models {{are driven by}} uncertain forcing ﬁelds: emissions, boundary conditions, wind ﬁelds, vertical turbulent diffusivity, kinetic chemical rates, etc. Data assimilation can help to assess these parameters or ﬁelds of parameters. Because such parameters are often much more uncertain than the ﬁelds diagnosed in meteorology and oceanography, data assimilation is much <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inverse modelling <b>challenge</b> in this context. In this article these ideas are experimented with by revisiting the Chernobyl accident dispersion event over Europe. A fast four-dimensional variational scheme (4 D-Var) is developed, which seems appropriate for the retrieval of large parameter ﬁelds from large observation sets and the retrieval of parameters that are nonlinearly related to concentrations. The 4 D-Var, and especially <b>an</b> approximate adjoint <b>of</b> the transport model, is tested and validated using several advection schemes that are inﬂuential on the forward simulation {{as well as on}} the data-assimilation results. Firstly, the inverse modelling system is applied to the assessment of the dry and wet deposition parameters. It is then applied to the retrieval of the emission ﬁeld alone, the joint optimization of removal-process parameters and source parameters and the optimization of larger parameter ﬁelds such as horizontal and vertical diffusivities or the dry-deposition velocity ﬁeld. The physical parameters used so far in the literature for the Chernobyl dispersion simulation are partly supported by this study. The crucial question of deciding whether such an inversion is merely <b>a</b> tuning <b>of</b> parameters or <b>a</b> retrieval <b>of</b> physically meaningful quantities is discussed. Even though inversion of parameter ﬁelds may fail to determine physical values for the parameters, it achieves statistical adaptation that partially corrects for model errors and, using the inverted parameter ﬁelds, leads to considerable improvement in the simulation scores.

40|$|The {{modern world}} {{we are living}} in today, consumes fasts amounts of fossil fuels in many sectors. One of these sectors is {{transport}} which is almost completely dependent on oil derivatives. This heavy dependency on oil and other types of fossil fuel makes it vulnerable for depletion. That the world is running out of fossil fuels is certain, but when most of the oil fields will be depleted is not known precisely. Waiting for the moment of depletion without taking any preventive steps can have devastating effects on transport throughout the world. With the collapse of transport whole economies can crumble and grind to a complete hold. Other side effects of fossil fuel use are the emissions of greenhouse gasses. When the fuel is used in transport it is most likely burned in an internal combustion engine. This produces greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide, hydro carbonates and nitrogen oxides. To combat the mentioned problems renewable forms of transport must be researched and developed. This project will focus on two candidates that are seen as capable replacements for fossil cars in the future, namely the hydrogen and electric car. Research on new transport systems requires high priority, given the importance of transport within society. The current field of research is mainly focused on the car it self and not on the whole car transport system. This research will investigate options for a Sustainable transport system in the Netherlands. Included within the analysis are the car and the impact on the national electricity production system. Studying the car as well as the system will improve the quality of information on which important choices can and have {{to be made in the}} near future. During this research focus will be put on the four main aspects of the transport system, technique, environment, economics and social factors. The technical focus will be on the car itself, by determining efficiency and safety, but also by looking at <b>a</b> full lifetime <b>of</b> the car including construction, use and decommissioning, called lifecycle analysis. This is brought to a national scale by introducing the cars in larger numbers into the Dutch passenger transport sector, and looking to there CO 2 emissions by using modelling. The best technical and environmental solution must still undergo economical and social scrutiny. For the costs of the renewable car and its user friendliness must not be more expensive or less friendly than the gasoline car. This research concluded with a clear environmental and technical winner. The electric car has proven to be the most efficient and less greenhouse emitting of the cars investigated during this project. At present the electric car emits about half the carbon dioxide emissions compared to a normal gasoline car during its lifetime and is around three to four times more efficient. The fuel source electricity and the production of this fuel source can have a very large impact on the emission footprint of the electric car. Higher efficiency in the production chain and renewable energy will have an immediate effect on the electric car emissions. The car itself is even capable of storing normally wasted brake energy back in to the batteries, and when the car is in idle (like for instance in traffic jams) the energy use is zero, unlike the gasoline engine. Efficiency of the electric car will most likely not improve much further than the current rate, due to the fact that the electric engine is already highly developed. Improvements can still be gained in the power management system the battery and the weight of the car. If large amounts of electric cars are used within the Netherlands more electricity will need to be produced, but if the cars are charged at night during the lower electricity demand window or by using smart grid technology, the impact on the electric grid will be insignificant. Extensive safety tests have concluded that the electric car is perfectly safe in crash situations and in case of fire, but still danger of being electrocuted will remain during crash situations, how statistically unlikely it may seem. The electric car has only one weak point, the battery. This single unit lowers the driving range, makes it more expensive, makes the car heavy, limits the lifetime and makes the car difficult to refuel. At present the fastest recharge time is around fifteen minutes with specialised systems, when using a normal socked the charge time will be extended to around 4 to 12 hours depending on the use of the car during the day. The range is dependent on the size of the battery varying between fifty to three hundred kilometres. The destination at present must be situated within this range, or there will be a twelve hour waiting period. Finally the best batteries currently available with a high enough energy density can only be recharged around a thousand or two thousand times, limiting the lifetime of the battery, when used daily to around five years. If the rest of the car will last as long as a normal gasoline car, around 3 batteries will be needed during the lifetime of the electric car. To make the electric car compete on the same level as the gasoline car, research is needed that will improve the battery. The hydrogen fuel cell car is specifically meant to overcome the range and refuelling problem that occur when batteries are used. By using hydrogen as energy carrier the hydrogen car can be refuelled fast and easily (comparable with tanking LPG). Due to its electric drive train similar to that in the electric car the hydrogen car is twice as efficient as the gasoline car. It is capable of storing back brake energy in a small battery used as energy buffer. While standing still the energy use will also be zero. The carbon dioxide footprint of the fuel cell car will be lower than the gasoline car if natural gas reforming is used for the production of hydrogen. The range of the car lays around one to three-hundred kilometres. The safety of the fuel cell car is well tested by the producers of the Honda Clarity, the biggest danger is the storage system of the hydrogen. It has proven to be save in crash and fire situations, also hydrogen will disperse more easily compared with for instance CNG due to its low mass, but danger of leakage and explosion will always remain as long as hydrogen is stored in pressure vessels. Unfortunately the additional energy conversions and the use of hydrogen bring with it <b>a</b> lot <b>of</b> disadvantages. Hydrogen as a fuel can not be found in nature in its pure form. At present most hydrogen is produced with natural gas steam reforming, and with electrolysis of water. In every transformation energy is lost, especially when electrolysis of water is used. At present the footprint <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fuel cell car powered with hydrogen produced by electrolysis is almost five times higher than a normal gasoline car during its lifetime. To bring the footprint below the gasoline car, large shares of durable electricity are needed or hydrogen from gas reforming must be used. The lower efficiency of the fuel cell car compared to the electrical car will also increase the grid strain. Larger amounts of electricity are needed for the production of hydrogen when the car is applied in larger numbers. To improve the energy density <b>of</b> hydrogen to <b>a</b> usable level it is stored at high pressures up to 300 bar. To achieve this, high power compressors are needed and to store the hydrogen heavy bottles are used with extensive safety features. The most important part in the hydrogen car is the fuel cell that transforms hydrogen in to an electrical flow and water. This system is still being improved to increase reliability, lifetime, lower the weight and most importantly the costs. The hydrogen car with all its complicated systems is extremely expensive and at present only a toy for the wealthy. Exponential improvement in the car and the fuel production system will be needed to come close to the electric car concerning technical but mainly environmental benefits. For both the electric and fuel cell car the service sector will need to adapt to the new technology used. At present not many mechanics are qualified and capable of solving car problems on an electric or hydrogen fuel cell car. Also the fuel is not readily available at any gas station, or even at home. Charging an electric car on the parking lot when living on the eights floor <b>of</b> <b>an</b> apartment building is quite <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> without the correct infra structure. Making the car look and behave like the a normal gasoline car is already achieved. Giving these cars the same benefits in user-friendliness as the gasoline car will be <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenges,</b> especially in new price of the car, refuelling speed, fuel availability, service availability and range. The electric and hydrogen car must first fulfil the user-friendliness and service availability taken for granted with the gasoline car, before it can win the harts of the most car users. A solution can be found in a hybrid electric and hydrogen car. For most of the car travel in the Netherlands is below 50 km per day, a range easily achieved on batteries, but if longer range is required the hydrogen fuel cell system can kick in. The transport sector is not easily diverted from the fossil fuel path. Fossil fuels still have too much positive benefits to outweigh their negative effects. Luckily people are noticing the negative effects and change is in the air. The only hope is that the right choices are being made. This research clearly shows that firstly electric and eventually, (if needed) hydrogen fuel cells are the right choice for future transport. <b>A</b> lot <b>of</b> research is needed to give the electric car the same versatility as the fossil fuelled cars, and this can only be achieved if maximum effort is put into sustainable transport by the people and the government. For one thing is sure when using fossil fuels, at the end of the line they are a finite fuel source and if we keep using it, they will eventually run out. If we wait till then for solutions it might be too late. ...|$|R
