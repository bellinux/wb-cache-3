5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E
25|$|At the {{shopping}} mall, Kohta develops feelings {{for the police}} officer trainee, Asami Nakaoka, after helping her subdue an angry mall survivor. He spends some quality time with her, and convinces her to join the group. Unfortunately, the friendship is short-lived when Asami becomes trapped while attempting to save a boy in the parking lot. She shouts for Kohta to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> that she will not become a zombie and cause pain to others around her. Kohta kills her and later finds himself in shock, but he is set straight by Shizuka, who uses a psychology trick of ordering him around like a sergeant.|$|E

Wong spoke about how the character of Catherine Black changed, saying [...] "there's a different relationship between Frank and his family this season because of the separation ... I think that will not only bring some kind of heartfelt drama but humor into it". Wong also stated [...] "we don't want to have the audience expect to see a serial killer every week. ...

Franks was asked to return again later in 2008 but could not <b>make</b> <b>it,</b> <b>so</b> Franks thought Rainie would not be seen again. She returned for the longer stint in 2010, starting on 3August. Franks {{did not expect to}} be asked to return in 2010, and said the call came as a surprise. She said it was [...] "ideal" [...] because it fitted in with another acting job she was undertaking at the time. She commented that Rainie would be [...] "unlikely to return without stirring up a bit of trouble". Rainie returned again on 12April2011 as a regular character, for Tanya's wedding to Greg Jessop, along with Tanya and Rainie's mother Cora, where Cora tries to build bridges between the sisters.|$|E
500|$|In Maine, {{the trail}} extends into even harsher environments, and sub-alpine and alpine growth descends to lower elevations. Alpine {{growth in the}} state ranges from around [...] in the Mahoosuc Range to below [...] {{in parts of the}} Hundred-Mile Wilderness, where nearly every area higher than [...] is {{evergreen}} forest. These forests include more species of evergreen, as well. In addition to the white pine, spruce and hemlock prevalent further south, Maine has many cedar trees along the trail. Near the northern terminus, there are even some tamarack (larch), a coniferous, pine-needled deciduous tree, which provides displays of yellow in the late fall after the birches and maples have gone bare. The hemlocks in Maine are also notable, as the woolly adelgid, which has ravaged populations further south, has not come into the state yet, and may be unable to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> far north due to the cold climate.|$|E

500|$|Johann Wilhelm von Archenholz {{claimed in}} 1791 that the lists were {{published}} by [...] "a tavern-keeper, in Drury lane", and that [...] "eight thousand copies are sold annually." [...] There {{is nothing to}} suggest that Hayes had any involvement with any edition other than that of 1769, and the list's authors following Derrick's death have not been identified. [...] From the 1770s Harris's List changes focus, {{moving away from the}} women of Covent Garden, to their stories. [...] Its prose becomes more genteel, lacking the euphemisms which had helped <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> popular. [...] These changes are echoed by the front cover, whose frontispiece becomes more gentrified. [...] Material from earlier editions is recycled, and little attention is paid to accuracy. [...] The responsibility for some of these changes can be attributed to John and James Roach, and John Aitkin, who from the late 1780s were the lists' publishers.|$|E
500|$|Despite his radical views, Haywood {{emerged from}} the trial with a {{national}} reputation. Eugene Debs called him [...] "the Lincoln of Labor." [...] Along with his colorful background and appearance, he {{was known for his}} blunt statements about capitalism.

[...] Another time, he began a speech by noting, [...] "Tonight I am going to speak on the class struggle and I am going to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> plain that even a lawyer can understand it." [...] Yet Haywood also had a flair for dangerous hyperbole that, when quoted in newspapers, was used to justify wholesale arrests of IWW strikers. [...] "Confiscate! That's good!" [...] he often said. [...] "I like that word. [...] It suggests stripping the capitalist, taking something away from him.

500|$|To help {{differentiate}} the Bennet sisters, Durran viewed Elizabeth as the [...] "tomboy", clothing her in earthy colours {{because of her}} love of the countryside. For the other sisters, Durran remarked, [...] "Jane was the most refined and yet it's still all a bit slapdash and homemade, because the Bennets have no money. One of the main things Joe wanted was for the whole thing to have a provincial feel. Mary is the bluestocking: serious and practical. And then Lydia and Kitty are a bit Tweedledum and Tweedledee {{in a kind of}} teenage way. I tried to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> that they'd be sort of mirror images. If one's wearing a green dress, the other will wear a green jacket; so you always have a visual asymmetry between the two." [...] In contrast to the 1940 film, the 2005 production displayed the Bennet sisters in worn-down but comfortable dresses that allowed the actors better moveability.|$|E

500|$|Dig Me Out {{was written}} in nearly two months and {{recorded}} from December 1996 to January 1997 at John and Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington. During the recording sessions, recording the vocal interplay between Tucker and co-vocalist and guitarist Carrie Brownstein involved some difficulties. However, the producer took care and prevented favoring one voice over the other. As Goodmanson recalls: [...] "We always used different mikes for the lead vocal and for the second vocal, or different kinds of processing to make those things really distinct. To <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> you can hear both things at once". Goodmanson {{also noted that the}} fact that the band features no bass player was an advantage for the album's production. He explained: [...] "The awesome thing about having no bass player is you can make the guitars sound as big as you want. Usually you have to clear all that room out for the bass, so you can hear the bass line. With no bass there, you can just go for giant guitar sounds that you wouldn't normally be able to go for".|$|E
500|$|Burnley is {{the primary}} {{songwriter}} in the band. Music industry attorney and author Martin Frascogna writes that [...] "it's unmistakably clear that Burnley started the group, is the creative force behind the group and essentially dictates the group's decisions." [...] Bands such as Nirvana, Live, Bush, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, and The Beatles have been cited as influences. Burnley remarked in 2009 that while the other band members did contribute, it was [...] "always left {{up to me to}} put all the pieces together and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> that it's even anything at all." [...] However, Burnley expressed how he considered Rauch to be his [...] "writing partner" [...] during Dear Agony, and that he looked forward to writing with him in the future. After joining the band in 2014 as part of the new lineup, Rauch provided writing contributions on Dark Before Dawn, writing the intro and outro tracks as well as riffs on two other tracks. Burnley revealed in 2015 that the whole band would write songs for Breaking Benjamin in the future, and that [...] "It just so happens that when they came on board for this album, I was already 95 percent done", adding, [...] "I'm really looking forward to writing the next one all together." ...|$|E
500|$|From {{contemporary}} reviews, The Washington Post {{gave the}} album a mixed review, stating that [...] "even by rap standards, [...] work is artless." [...] The review compared the album negatively to other rappers, noting that they [...] "construct complex hip-hop concertos for voice, beat-box and borrowed sounds, Schooly's best-known work {{is little more}} than a beat accompanying his foul-mouthed, ill-tempered rants". The review also found that [...] "there's no denying that his harsh communiqués crackle with a mean-streets vitality as fascinating as his confrontational world view is disturbing." [...] Robert Christgau gave the Jive reissue of the album a B, stating [...] "What other rapper would write a rhyme about the night his mother pulled a gun on him—or <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> clear that, just like in West Side Story, he's depraved on account of he's deprived. This doesn't speak too well of white critics, obviously, but it also doesn't take away his raps, his rips, or his muscleman groove." [...] Spin stated that it [...] "can't sustain an album with just reverb and a cowbell. Even if it is killer reverb and a way funky cowbell." [...] The NME placed Saturday Night! – The Album at number 20 on their list of the top albums of 1987. The single [...] "Saturday Night" [...] was also listed at number 28 on their list of Top 50 tracks of the year.|$|E
