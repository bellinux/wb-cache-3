Previous approaches are not highthroughput, are not generalizable or scalable, or lack sufficient data to be effective. We describe single mechanistic reactions as concerted electron movements from an electron orbital source to an electron orbital sink. We use an existing rule-based expert system to derive a dataset consisting of 2, 989 productive <b>mechanistic</b> <b>steps</b> and 6. 14 million non-productive <b>mechanistic</b> <b>steps.</b> We then pose identifying productive <b>mechanistic</b> <b>steps</b> as a ranking problem: rank potential orbital interactions such that the top ranked interactions yield the major products. The machine learning implementation follows a two-stage approach, in which we first train atom level reactivity filters to prune 94. 0 % of non-productive reactions with less than a 0. 1 % false negative rate. Then, we train an ensemble of ranking models on pairs of interacting orbitals to learn a relative productivity function over single mechanistic reactions in a given system. Without the use of explicit transformation patterns, the ensemble perfectly ranks the productive mechanisms at the top 89. 1 % of the time, rising to 99. 9 % of the time when top ranked lists with at most four nonproductive reactions are considered. The final system allows multi-step reaction prediction. Furthermore, it is generalizable, making reasonable predictions over reactants and conditions which the rule-based expert system does not handle. ...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe conserved {{multifunctional}} protein Gle 1 regulates {{gene expression}} at multiple steps: nuclear mRNA export, translation initiation, and translation termination. A GLE 1 mutation (FinMajor) is causally linked to human lethal congenital contracture syndrome- 1 (LCCS 1); however, the resulting perturbations on Gle 1 molecular function were unknown. FinMajor {{results in a}} proline-phenylalanine-glutamine peptide insertion within the uncharacterized Gle 1 coiled-coil domain.

Moreover, functional assays document a specific requirement for proper Gle 1 oligomerization during mRNA export, but not for Gle 1 ’s roles in translation.

Moreover, most mobile devices are affordable and equipped with technical specifications that enable the download of simple mobile applications to enhance learning. This paper discusses the application of a prototype mobile application, known as the Organic Chemistry Reaction Application (OCRA), which has been designed to run on any mobile devices with touch screen commands. The OCRA is a unique mobile application that allows its users to create their own organic molecules using hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and halogen atoms. In OCRA, the users are able to explicitly form and break chemical bond between atoms by sliding their fingers to move the electrons or atom, and predict logically the mechanics of three fundamental organic mechanism reactions - addition, substitution, and elimination. Users can use the touch screen feature to demonstrate the organic reaction mechanism explicitly through an electron moving technique, which is used to conceptually visualize the <b>mechanistic</b> <b>steps</b> in organic reaction mechanism. This enables the users to understand the macroscopic and microscopic concepts of organic reaction mechanism. Besides, the OCRA is a game-like mobile application with the objective of acquiring correct answers by achieving specific goals. It uses a touch screen feature to demonstrate the organic reaction mechanism explicitly, while the electron moving technique is employed to conceptually visualize the <b>mechanistic</b> <b>steps</b> in an organic reaction mechanism. The utilization of OCRA, therefore, is as an alternative tool to learn and understand organic reaction mechanism. This prototype is a user controlled tool, which provides convenience and flexibility besides being capable of enhancing a user's confidence in learning organic reaction mechanism. Hence, the OCRA is a practical example of a mobile application that has been innovatively designed to enhance the value of e-learning in the educational context...|$|E

Metabolic pathways based on ribozymes may have existed {{at an early stage}} of evolution. Results: We have isolated a novel ribozyme that mediates Michael-adduct formation at a Michael-acceptor substrate, similar to the rate-limiting <b>step</b> of the <b>mechanistic</b> sequence of thymidylate synthase. The kinetic characterization of this catalyst revealed a rate enhancement by a factor of ∼ 105. The ribozyme shows substrate specificity and can act as an intermolecular catalyst which transfers the Michael-donor substrate onto an external 20 -mer RNA oligonucleotide containing the Michael-acceptor system. Conclusions: The ribozyme described here is the first example of a catalytic RNA with Michael-adduct forming activity which represents a key <b>mechanistic</b> <b>step</b> in metabolic pathways and other biochemical reactions.

Deletion of a telomere-associated protein, Ndj 1, {{results in the}} failure of both attachment and clustering of telomeres at the nuclear envelope and delays several landmarks of meiosis I, such as pairing, synaptonemal complex formation, and timing of the meiosis I division. We explored the role of Ndj 1 in meiotic recombination, which occurs through the formation and repair of programmed double-strand breaks. The ndj 1 Δ mutation allows {{for the formation of}} the first detectable strand invasion intermediate (i. e., single-end invasion) with wild-type kinetics; however, it confers a delay {{in the formation of the}} double-Holliday junction intermediate and both crossover and noncrossover products. These results challenge the widely held notion that clustering of telomeres in meiosis promotes the ability of homologous chromosomes to find one another in budding Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We propose that an Ndj 1 -dependent function is critical for stabilizing analogous strand invasion intermediates that exist in two separate branches of the bifurcated pathway, leading to either noncrossover or crossover formation.
