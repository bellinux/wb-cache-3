The wall behind the statue is inscribed with: “If liberty <b>means</b> <b>anything</b> at all, it means the right to tell people what {{they do not want to}} hear”, words from his proposed preface to Animal Farm and a rallying cry for the idea of free speech in an open society.|$|E
25|$|I don't {{know what}} Color Field {{painting}} means. I {{think it was}} probably invented by some critic, which is okay, but I don't think the phrase <b>means</b> <b>anything.</b> Color Field painting? I mean, what is color? Painting {{has to do with}} a lot of things. Color is among the things it has to do with. It has to do with surface. It has to do with shape, It has to do with feelings which are more difficult to get at.|$|E
25|$|Probably no {{instrument}} in modern time so {{lends itself to}} threats to constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so-called lie detector. The threat of its use or the intimidation inherent in its use restricts free expression and communication of ideas, intrudes on an individual's subconscious thought, makes him fear to speak his thoughts freely, or compels him to speak against his will. To my mind, the entire purpose of these machines is to invade a man's mind and find what lurks in the innermost part of his mental consciousness for reasons which {{have nothing to do}} with his ability to perform a job. If the right of privacy <b>means</b> <b>anything</b> at all and if it is a right to be cherished in our society, it means that people should be entitled to have thoughts, hopes, desires, and dreams that are beyond the reach of a bureaucrat, an employer, or an electronic technician. This is something which enthusiasts for these machines do not seem to understand. They do not understand and they do not appreciate how important privacy is to each American, and as long as that lesson is not understood, we all will find our right to privacy constricted if not abrogated entirely. I propose this legislation to ban the use of the polygraph for employment purposes in the hopes that Congress will pause for a moment, step back, and take a long look at the issues involved in the unrestrained use of the polygraph. Legislation is necessary to bring some order and control to the practice...|$|E

[...] However, it is constitutionally permissible {{for the government to}} prevent the mailing or sale of obscene items, though they may be viewed only in private. Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition (2002) further upheld these rights by invalidating the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, holding that, because the act [...] "rohibit child pornography that does not depict an actual child" [...] it was overly broad and unconstitutional under the First Amendment and that: ...|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy X: Will is an {{original}} audio drama {{included in the}} release, playing during the ending credits. It features multiple characters from the games, alongside two new characters: the shy summoner Kurgum, and his obnoxious companion, Chuami, who narrates. The two are sent to recruit Yuna to investigate a case of unauthorized [...] "Beckoning" [...] (talking to the dead) in the Moonflow region. What they discover, however, is far more serious: a mass overflow of unsent (dead people taking corporeal forms). Following this ominous phenomenon, Sin also returns, terrorizing the world once again. Forced to prepare for another battle, Yuna breaks up with Tidus. Kurgum tries to do same with Chuami, only to discover she never had any feelings for him. A confused Tidus consults with Lulu, who chastises him for his naivete and reminds him that Sin's return <b>means</b> <b>anything</b> else can also return. [...] Unlike Chuami, Tidus understands her and renews his oath of dedicating himself to Yuna. The story ends with Yuna's public announcement of her intention to battle Sin.|$|E

500|$|On 16 October 2009, Wilders {{arrived in}} the United Kingdom and was quickly forced to move his press conference due to protests by about forty members of the {{organization}} Islam4UK, an organization that was later shut down under the UK's Terrorism Act 2000 on 14 January 2010. Though the Home Office had asserted that his entry into the country would not be blocked, a spokesman said his [...] "statements and behaviour during a visit will inevitably impact on any future decisions to admit him." [...] His visit to the UK met with protest, but Wilders called it [...] "a victory" [...] in a press conference. On his outspoken views on Islam, he said: [...] "I {{have a problem with the}} Islamic ideology, the Islamic culture, because I feel that the more Islam that we get in our societies the less freedom we get." [...] He opened the press conference with a quote from George Orwell's preface to Animal Farm: [...] "If liberty <b>means</b> <b>anything</b> at all, it means the right to tell people what they don't want to hear". Lord Pearson, who had invited him, said his arrival was [...] "a celebration of the victory of freedom of speech over those who would prevent it in this country, particularly the Islamists, the violent Jihadists who are on the march across the world and in the UK." ...|$|E

[...] The Court added: [...] "f the constitutional conception of 'equal protection of the laws' <b>means</b> <b>anything,</b> it must {{at the very least}} mean that a bare ... desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest."(emphasis added) The majority opinion in Romer neither mentioned nor overruled the Court's prior opinion in Bowers v.

2500|$|The British Government, in authorising {{the letters}} {{despatched}} to King Hussein [...] before {{the outbreak of}} the revolt by Sir Henry McMahon, would seem to raise a doubt as to whether our pledges to King Hussein as head of the Arab nation are consistent with French intentions to make not only Syria but Upper Mesopotamia another Tunis. If our support of King Hussein and the other Arabian leaders of less distinguished origin and prestige <b>means</b> <b>anything</b> it means that we are prepared to recognize the full sovereign independence of the Arabs of Arabia and Syria. It would seem time to acquaint the French Government with our detailed pledges to King Hussein, and to make it clear to the latter whether he or someone else is to be the ruler of Damascus, which is the one possible capital for an Arab State, which could command the obedience of the other Arabian Emirs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{plurality}} opinion {{stated that it}} was upholding what it called the [...] "essential holding" [...] of Roe. The essential holding consists of three parts: (1) Women {{have the right to}} choose to have an abortion prior to viability and to do so without undue interference from the State; (2) the State can restrict the abortion procedure post viability, so long as the law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman’s life or health; and (3) the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child. The plurality asserted that the fundamental right to abortion is grounded in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the plurality reiterated what the Court had said in Eisenstadt v. Baird: [...] "f the right of privacy <b>means</b> <b>anything,</b> it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child." ...|$|E
