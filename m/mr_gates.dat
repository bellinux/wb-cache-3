500|$|In 2008, Gates {{appeared}} {{in a series of}} ads to promote Microsoft. The first commercial, co-starring Jerry Seinfeld, is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside. [...] The salesman is trying to sell <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gates</b> shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in New Mexico in 1977, for a traffic violation. As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a [...] "Yes", he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a [...] "Yes". Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about [...] "nothing" [...] (Seinfeld). In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.|$|E

60|$|At first Mr. Henderson {{would give}} no ear to these appeals, but {{shook his head}} pessimistically. He was not a politician--so much the better, we don't want a politician; he was a plain {{business}} man exactly what is needed; a conservative, level-headed business man wholly lacking in those sensational qualities which are a stench in the nostrils of good citizens. Mr. Giles Henderson admitted that {{the time had come}} when a man of these qualities was needed--but he was not the man. Mr. Tredway was the man--so he told Mr. Tredway; <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gates</b> of Brampton was the man--so he assured <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gates.</b> Mr. Henderson had no desire to meddle in politics; his life was a happy and a full one. But was it not Mr. Henderson's duty? Cincinnatus left the plough, and Mr. Henderson should leave the ledger at the call of his countrymen.|$|E
50|$|Gates {{married before}} 1717, since on 6 June {{of that year}} his eldest child, a {{daughter}} named Atkinson, {{was buried in the}} north cloister of Westminster Abbey. This unusual Christian name, which was borne by another daughter of Gates (buried 1736), was derived from a Mrs. Atkinson, who had been laundress to Queen Anne, and who had brought up <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Gates,</b> and made her her heiress.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Gerrish stopped so {{abruptly}} that Putney, who {{was engaged}} in talk with Colonel Marvin, looked up with a startled air, too late to secure the floor. Mr. Peck recognised <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gates,</b> who stood with his wrists caught in either hand across his middle, and looked round with a quizzical glance before he began to speak. Putney lifted his hand in playful threatening toward Colonel Marvin, who got away from him with a face of noiseless laughter, and went and joined Mr. Wilmington where he sat with his wife, who entered into the talk between the men.|$|E

They think that my hospitality has been shamefully abused. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gates</b> said he should think I would have Mr. Putney arrested. But I don't care for all that. What I wish is to prove to you that I am right; and if I can go with you to call on Mrs. Putney, I shall not care what any one else says. Will you come?" ...|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, as it {{afterwards}} turned out, the Commander-in-Chief {{was most}} urgently pressing Colonel Warrington's promotion upon Congress; and, {{as if his}} difficulties before the enemy were not enough, he being at this hard time of winter entrenched at Valley Forge, commanding five or six thousand men at the most, almost without fire, blankets, food, or ammunition, {{in the face of}} Sir William Howe's army, which was perfectly appointed, and three times as numerous as his own; as if, I say, this difficulty was not enough to try him, he had further to encounter the cowardly distrust of Congress, and insubordination and conspiracy amongst the officers in his own camp. During the awful winter of '77, when one blow struck by the sluggard {{at the head of the}} British forces might have ended the war, and all was doubt, confusion, despair in the opposite camp (save in one indomitable breast alone), my brother had an interview with the Chief, which he has subsequently described to me, and of which Hal could never speak without giving way to the deepest emotion. Mr. Washington had won no such triumph as that which the dare-devil courage of Arnold and the elegant imbecility of Burgoyne had procured for Gates and the northern army. Save in one or two minor encounters, which proved how daring his bravery was, and how unceasing his watchfulness, General Washington had met with defeat after defeat from an enemy in all points his superior. The Congress mistrusted him. Many an officer in his own camp hated him. Those who had been disappointed in ambition, those who had been detected in peculation, those whose selfishness or incapacity his honest eyes had spied out,--were all more, or less in league against him. Gates was the chief towards whom the malcontents turned. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gates</b> was the only genius fit to conduct the war; and with a vaingloriousness, which he afterwards generously owned, he did not refuse the homage which was paid him.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} {{the week}} that the study took place, White found that nine-tenths of the wire copy got {{rejected}} and the process is made by highly subjective decisions based on the editor's own set of experiences, attitudes and expectations. White found that in this particular study, the majority of the rejections could be classified in two ways: 1) not worthy of being reported or 2) there was another story on the same event. Pertaining to the first reason, many of the explanations <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gates</b> gives are for rejection are [...] "highly-subjective value judgments." [...] Examples of this are seen when <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gates</b> writes [...] "too Red" [...] or [...] "don't care for suicides" [...] (386). Pertaining to the second reason of rejection, given for the majority of the rejections, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gates</b> made no [...] "personal" [...] rejections to the copy, but there was simply no space available for it in the paper. The later the story came to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gates,</b> the less of a chance it had to take up any valuable space remaining.|$|E

5000|$|In 1950, David Manning White, {{a journalism}} {{professor}} at Boston University, {{looked at the}} factors an editor takes into consideration when deciding which news will make the paper and which news will not; intending to examine how a [...] "gate keeper" [...] examines his [...] "gate" [...] within a channel of mass communication. White contacted an editor, {{a man in his}} mid-40s with 25 years of experience, whom he calls [...] "Mr. Gates." [...] <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gates</b> was the wire editor of a morning newspaper in a mid-west city of 100,000 that had a circulation of 30,000. During the case study, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gates</b> retained all copy that he rejected from the paper for a week.

50|$|Beyond the Seattle area, Gates was {{appointed}} {{to the board of directors}} of the national United Way in 1980, becoming the first woman to lead it in 1983. Her tenure on the national board's executive committee is believed to have helped Microsoft, based in Seattle, at a crucial time. In 1980, she discussed her son's company with John Opel, a fellow committee member and the chairman of International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). Opel, by some accounts, mentioned <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Gates</b> to other IBM executives. A few weeks later, IBM took a chance by hiring Microsoft, then a small software firm, to develop an operating system for its first personal computer.|$|R
5000|$|He {{concludes that}} as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gates</b> is {{representing}} [...] "gate keepers" [...] and wire editors as a whole, there doesn't {{seem to be}} a particular choice of news by categories. During the week the case study took place, however, there was a strong emphasis on Human Interest stories because there was a large appeal to a story regarding a Cardinal of the Catholic Church. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gates</b> also concludes that the gate keeper's standards and taste should refer back to the audience and that they are the ones being served and pleased. His concluding remarks provide a great summary of the purpose and findings of the study. [...] "Through studying his overt reasons for rejecting news stories from the press associations we see how highly subjective, how based on the [...] "gate keeper's" [...] own set of experiences, attitudes and expectations the communication of [...] "news" [...] really is" [...] (390).|$|E
5000|$|White {{examined}} Mr. Gates' {{performance for}} a specific day and put the data in tables which show the amount and type of news which appeared {{on the front pages}} and the total number of dispatches used. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gates</b> admitted to preferring political news to other types of news and explained that he tries to avoid sensationalism and consistently leans more towards being [...] "conservative" [...] both in political views and in writing style. Observed patterns throughout the week also show that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Gates</b> leans away from stories filled with figures and statistics and prefers stories that contain more of a narrative. His notes and reasons for rejection can also show Mr. Gates' writing standard, using [...] "too vague," [...] "not interesting," [...] and [...] "dull writing" [...] on a number of occasions. A question that White poses and says should be considered in this case study is, [...] "Does the category really enter into the choice?" ...|$|E
