40|$|The authors {{explore the}} effects of spatial and {{locational}} cueing upon the aggregated results of cognitive mapping data. Using four experimental data sets they demonstrate that locational cueing introduces random error into the analysis and that spatial cueing increases the relative and absolute accuracy of spatial products (external representations of spatial knowledge). These effects are consistent regardless of whether individual or place cognition is assessed. As such, location and spatial cueing compromise both construct and convergent validity, {{and the integrity of}} the conclusions from previous studies on cognitive mapping are brought into question. It is suggested that a multidata collection, <b>multidata</b> <b>analysis</b> approach should be adopted to highlight and compensate for these methodological weaknesses. ...|$|E
40|$|Epigenetic, N-S, NNE-SSW quartz veins {{crosscut}} metapelites and metagabbro in Maru area. The {{objectives of}} this work were to study field, mineralogy, and geochemical characteristics of gold bearing quartz veins and soils. Euhedral and polygonal magnetite with hematite constituted the major ore minerals. Quartz occurred as main gangue phase with appreciable sericite and chlorite. The mineralogy of soil retrieved from twelve minor gold fields examined with X-ray diffraction is quartz ± albite ± microcline ± muscovite ± hornblende ± magnetite ± illite ± kaolinite ± halloysite ± smectite ± goethite ± vermiculite ± chlorite. The concentration of gold in quartz vein varies from 10. 0 to 6280. 0 [*]ppb with appreciable Pb (3. 5 – 157. 0 [*]ppm) and ΣREE (3. 6 to 82. 9 [*]ppm). Gold content in soil varies from < 5. 0 to 5700. 0 [*]ppb. The soil is characterized by As ± Sb gold’s pathfinder geochemical association. <b>Multidata</b> set <b>analysis</b> revealed most favourable areas for gold. Possibility of magmatic fluids as part of ore constituents is feasible due to presence of several intrusions close to quartz veins. Based on field, mineralogical, and geochemical evidences, ore fluids may have been derived from fracturing, metamorphic dewatering, crustal devolatilization of sedimentary, gabbroic protoliths, and emplaced in an orogenic setting...|$|R
