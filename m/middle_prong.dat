2500|$|While Will Walker allowed English {{to build}} a splash dam and do minor logging in the <b>Middle</b> <b>Prong</b> watershed, he disliked the thought of {{large-scale}} logging operations mowing down his valley's virgin forests. [...] In 1901, Colonel Wilson B.

50|$|The Roaring River and its {{headwater}} tributaries (its East, <b>Middle</b> and West <b>Prongs)</b> all flow {{for their}} entire lengths in Wilkes County, {{rising in the}} Blue Ridge Mountains near and around Stone Mountain State Park. Below the confluence of its principal tributaries, the Roaring River flows southeastwardly to its confluence with the Yadkin River, about 4 mi (6 km) south-southwest of Ronda. The river gives {{its name to the}} community of Roaring River, a village located {{at the mouth of the}} river.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike most of {{the high}} peaks of the Eastern Smokies, neither the Tennessee-North Carolina state {{boundary}} nor any county lines traverse the summit of Marks Knob, and thus the mountain received little attention for most of recorded history. Trail guides from the early 1930s refer to the mountain as [...] "Cam's Knob" [...] and list its elevation as greater than 6,140 feet. [...] In the 1920s and early 1930s, two trails - [...] the Rosser Trail and an unnamed spur trail - [...] connected Dashoga Ridge to the logging camps at Smokemont to the southwest and Straight Fork to the southeast. The Rosser Trail ascended northeastward from Smokemont (namely, the Chasteen Creek area) across Hughes Ridge to Enloe Creek, and then over Highland Ridge to the Raven Fork Valley. The trail continued northward along Raven Fork around the western base of Breakneck Ridge to an area known as Three Forks, where the Left, <b>Middle,</b> and Right <b>prongs</b> of Raven Fork converge to form Raven Fork proper. Beyond Three Forks, the trail wound its way northward up the crest of Dashoga Ridge, crossing the summits of Marks Knob and Mount Hardison before joining the Balsam Mountain Trail. The area's only other trail ascended northwestward from Straight Fork, crossing Hyatt Ridge to McGee Springs. The trail then turned westward to traverse the crest of Breakneck Ridge and descend to Three Forks, where it joined the Rosser Trail. By 1974, the Hyatt Ridge Trail had been developed along the crest of Hyatt Ridge, rising northward along the ridgecrest from Straight Fork and approaching Dashoga Ridge from the east.|$|R
2500|$|Although Townsend {{sold his}} Little River tract to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park Commission in 1926, {{he did so}} with the {{agreement}} that he could continue logging {{in the area for}} 15 years. [...] After logging operations had commenced at Elkmont in 1925, Townsend ordered the tracks to be pulled up and moved to <b>Middle</b> <b>Prong.</b> [...] A base for the <b>Middle</b> <b>Prong</b> operation was set up at the junction of Lynn Camp Prong and Thunderhead Prong. [...] This base quickly grew into a small town, which was given the name Tremont, a combination of [...] "tree" [...] and [...] "mountain." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first logging {{venture to}} reach Walker Valley and the <b>Middle</b> <b>Prong</b> area {{was that of}} John English, a Knoxville {{businessman}} whose company began cutting timber in nearby Tuckaleechee Cove in the early 1880s. [...] English used a series of splash dams to move the logs down Little River to a mill {{on the outskirts of}} Knoxville. [...] One such splash dam was located at the mouth of Spruce Flats along <b>Middle</b> <b>Prong,</b> just above Walker Valley. [...] While English's lumbering venture turned a small profit, a flood along Little River apparently wiped out his splash dams in the late 1890s, and his venture had folded by 1900.|$|E
2500|$|William Marion Walker (1838–1919), who {{was born}} in nearby Tuckaleechee Cove, and his first wife Nancy Caylor were the first known {{permanent}} settlers along <b>Middle</b> <b>Prong.</b> [...] Walker arrived in the area around 1859 and settled in the valley that now bears his name.

2500|$|Dora Cope, {{who lived}} at Tremont in the late 1920s and 1930s, later {{recalled}} various aspects {{of life in the}} logging camps.

2500|$|In 1918, Walker {{suffered}} a stroke that left him largely incapacitated. On December 26 of that year, he finally agreed to sell <b>Middle</b> <b>Prong</b> to Little River Lumber after Townsend gave him his word that he wouldn't harvest trees along Thunderhead Prong. [...] Six months later, Walker died after suffering a second stroke. [...] On Townsend's orders, a small train carried Walker's coffin ceremoniously to the Bethel Baptist Cemetery in Tuckaleechee, where it rests today.|$|E
2500|$|Tremont is {{situated}} along the <b>Middle</b> <b>Prong</b> of Little River {{a few miles}} south of Townsend in Blount County, Tennessee. [...] "Tremont" [...] can refer to the former logging town of Tremont or the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont, but it generally applies to Middle Prong's entire watershed between Miry Ridge {{to the east and}} Defeat Ridge to the west. [...] Both of these ridges run perpendicular to the main crest of the Great Smokies, which rises several thousand feet above Tremont to the south.|$|E
2500|$|The {{source of}} Little River is {{approximately}} five miles above Elkmont along {{the slopes of}} Clingmans Dome, where it begins as a small trickle before its confluence with several smaller streams at an area known as Three Forks. [...] In just over a mile, the river gains strength as it absorbs Meigs Post Prong, Rough Creek, and Fish Camp Prong before its junction with Jakes Creek at Elkmont. Just beyond Elkmont, the river turns sharply to the west toward its junction with <b>Middle</b> <b>Prong</b> at a popular swimming area known as the [...] "Y".|$|E

From here, the river continues northward, absorbing Spruce Flats Branch and several smaller streams before steadying in a relatively flat area known as Walker Valley. The <b>Middle</b> <b>Prong</b> is shadowed by the old roadbed of the Little River Railroad for almost all of its nine-mile (14 km) length.|$|E

Some can be accessed by hiking trails, but others are very remote making hiking to them difficult even though they can clearly be seen from the highway. This section of road is popular with tourists and with motorcyclists due to its curvy nature.|$|E
