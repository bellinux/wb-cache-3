40|$|End {{of project}} reportImprovements in milking {{efficiency}} {{have a greater}} influence than any other aspect of the dairy farmers work on overall farm labour inputs (Whipp, 1992). In order to facilitate the examination of milking process labour inputs, the milking process may be divided into the following three components: herding pre and post milking (transfer of cows {{to and from the}} milking parlour); milking (milking tasks / work routines within the parlour); and washing (washing of milking machine and yard). Meanwhile, within milking specifically, the number of cows milked per operator per hour is the best measure of both the performance of the operator and the milking installation (Clough, 1978). This is affected by the following three factors: the milking times of the cows, the number and arrangement of the <b>milking</b> <b>units,</b> and the operator’s work routine (Whipp, 1992). The addition of extra <b>milking</b> <b>units</b> will only increase milking performance if the operator has idle time during milking (Hansen, 1999) ...|$|R

There are studied 27 cows imported from Austria during the year 2005, and managed in Nikel-Kruje. The study shows that the heifers aging 32 - 34 months have produced more milk than heifers ageing 28 - 31 months. In addition, the heifers that past more months of their pregnancy in Albania have produced less milk, which is related with the diffrence of feed ration from country of origine.

5000|$|Higher {{initial cost}} - AMS systems cost {{approximately}} €120,000 ($190,524) per <b>milking</b> <b>unit</b> as of 2003 (presuming barn space is already available for loose-stall housing). Equipment costs decreased from $175,000 {{for the first}} stall to $158,000. Equipment costs decreased from $10,000/stall for a double-six parlor to $9000/stall for a double-ten parlor with a cost of $1200/stall for pipeline milking. Initial parlor cost was increased $5000/stall to represent a high cost parlor. Whether it is economically beneficial to invest in an AMS instead of a conventional milking parlor depends on constructions costs, investments in the milking system and costs of labour. Besides costs of labour, the availability of labour should also be taken into account. In general, an AMS is economically beneficial for smaller scale farms, and large dairies can usually operate more cheaply with a milking parlor.|$|E
50|$|Milking {{machines}} {{are used to}} harvest milk from cows when manual milking becomes inefficient or labour-intensive. One early model was patented in 1907. The <b>milking</b> <b>unit</b> is the portion of a milking machine for removing milk from an udder. It {{is made up of}} a claw, four teatcups, (Shells and rubber liners) long milk tube, long pulsation tube, and a pulsator. The claw is an assembly that connects the short pulse tubes and short milk tubes from the teatcups to the long pulse tube and long milk tube. (Cluster assembly) Claws are commonly made of stainless steel or plastic or both. Teatcups are composed of a rigid outer shell (stainless steel or plastic) that holds a soft inner liner or inflation. Transparent sections in the shell may allow viewing of liner collapse and milk flow. The annular space between the shell and liner is called the pulse chamber.|$|E
5000|$|Decreased {{contact between}} farmer and herd - Effective animal {{husbandry}} {{requires that the}} farmer be fully aware of herd condition. In conventional milking, the cows are observed before milking equipment is attached, and ill or injured cows can be earmarked for attention. Automatic milking removes the farmer from such close contact with the animal, with the possibility that illness may go unnoticed for longer periods and both milk quality and cow welfare suffer. In practice, milk quality sensors at the <b>milking</b> <b>unit</b> attempt to detect changes in milk due to infection, and farmers inspect the herd frequently. However this concern has meant that farmers are still tied to a seven-day schedule. Modern automatic milking systems attempt to rectify this problem by gathering data {{that would not be}} available in many conventional systems including milk temperature, milk conductivity, milk color including infrared scan, change in milking speed, change in milking time or milk letdown by quarter, cow's weight, cow's activity (movements), time spent ruminating, etc.|$|E

5000|$|Difficult {{to apply}} in pasture systems - as a {{continous}} animal is pediment for a optimal {{utilization of the}} AMS unit, AMS works at their best in zero-grazing systems, in which the cow is housed indoors {{for most of the}} lactation period. Zero-grazing suits areas (e.g. the Netherlands) where land is at a premium, as maximum land can be devoted to feed production which is then collected by the farmer and brought to the animals in the barn. In pasture systems, cows graze in fields and are required to walk to the milking parlour. It has been found that it can be challenging to make cows maintain a high milking frequency if the distance to walk between pasture and <b>milking</b> <b>unit</b> is too great. Maintaining production on pasture has, however, been shown to be possible in amongst others the AUTOGRASSMILK project.

In the first study, 30 high-yielding cows in early lactation were subjected to two different degrees of controlled cow traffic, and the effects on milk yield, dry matter intake, feeding patterns and voluntary visits to the <b>milking</b> <b>unit</b> and the control gates were measured. A model of mixed distributions for estimations of biologically relevant meal criteria from registrations in roughage stations was also evaluated. In the second study, the behaviour of 24 cows after they had been redirected in control gates was observed, {{and the cause of}} long redirection times from gates until they showed up in the <b>milking</b> <b>unit</b> was examined. In the third study, 9 cows were subjected to three different cow traffic systems in a carry-over design and the effects on cortisol concentrations in milk and ruminating patterns were studied. The studies showed that milking frequency and thereby milk production can be altered by different time settings in the control gates without limiting the daily feed intake of the cows. A high degree of guidance provokes social effects in the queue in front of the <b>milking</b> <b>unit</b> and in the feeding areas. It also makes it difficult for the cows to follow their natural feeding patterns. Judging from measurements of milk cortisol concentrations, controlled cow traffic was not stressful for the cows. Cows initiated meals with short intervals, which offered many opportunities to milk them. But the queue in front of the <b>milking</b> <b>unit</b> caused long redirection times, and the control gates failed to guide cows to high milking frequencies. Individual differences in feeding patterns and how cows respond to redirections in the control gates suggest that the control gates should be making decisions on an individual level...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{integration}} of robotic milking in the dairy farm and focusses on the following aspects: (a) required milking capacity of robotic <b>milking</b> <b>units,</b> (b) cow traffic and visits to the <b>milking</b> <b>units</b> and (c) design of total systems. The capacity of a milking stall in milkings per hour depends on the milking time per milking, the occupation time of the milking stall and the accessability of the milking parlour. Based on milk yields of 14. 1, 10. 7 and 8. 1 and 7. 0 min per milking were established. It is expected that because of cows loitering at or obstructing the entry or exit and because of a certain daily pattern in the AMS visits, an effective occupation of about 60 % of the milking stall will be possible. The capacity is then 4. 2, 4. 5 and 5. 2 milkings per hour. It was assumed that an AMS-stall is vailable 20 h per day for milking and 4 h per day for cleaning. For a herd of 100 lactating cows, three times daily milking and an occupation time of the milking stall of 60 % of the available 20 h, four milking stalls are needed. Based on experiences gained in various experiments a lay out is suggested for an automatic milking system with automatic voluntary cow traffic. For automatic milking in a milking parlour with milking of cows in batches (human controlled cow traffic) the number of milking stalls will depend mainly on the chosen group size. For labour reasons this group size should not be too small and may vary between 50 and 100 cows. Based on the requirement {{that a group of}} cows has to be milked within approximately 1 h and an automatic milking stall with a 100 % occupation time, the required number of milking stalls for three times per day milking and for herd sizes of 50, 100 and 200 cows are respectively 6, 6 and 8.

40|$|When {{automatic}} milking {{is combined}} with grazing the cows are given {{a unique opportunity to}} choose between being indoors or outdoors. Concerns have been raised about achieving sufficient number of milkings per day since the cows’ motivation to be milked is low and cows are expected to go to milking voluntarily. The overall aim was therefore to examine how management routines affect cow motivation to visit the <b>milking</b> <b>unit</b> several times a day. First it was hypothesised that distance to pasture and level of supplements affects the milking frequency. The results demonstrated that cows with a shorter distance to pasture had a higher milking frequency during {{the first part of the}} grazing season and a higher milk yield compared with cows pasturing further from the barn. One important finding was that cows on the distant pasture changed their behaviour as the grazing season progressed and almost ceased to walk to their pasture area. A high level of silage supplements compared with a buffer feed offered in the barn had no affect on the milk yield. Also there was no affect on the number of milkings during the first part of the grazing season but during the latter part, cows with a high level of silage had a lower number of milkings. It was also hypothesized that it is possible to strengthen the cows’ perception of a feed reward in the <b>milking</b> <b>unit</b> by training the cow to respond to a conditioned stimulus, an acoustic signal. Most of the cows learnt to approach the <b>milking</b> <b>unit</b> following the signal when they were in an enclosed area of the barn, close to the <b>milking</b> <b>unit.</b> However, when receiving the signal out on pasture the response to the signal was variable and comparatively low. Finally, the hypothesis that enhanced sensory stimulation during milking by feeding or stroking the cows’ abdomen affects the level of the oxytocin and cortisol during milking was tested. Feeding during milking increased the plasma oxytocin level and milk production whereas brushing during milking depressed the milking-related release of cortisol, possibly inducing an anti-stress effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of pre-milking mechanical teat stimulation on milk yield and milking performance of dairy buffaloes in early lactation. For this purpose, twenty-two healthy Italian Mediterranean buffaloes in their first to third lactation and in early lactation (< 120 days in milk) were subjected to two treatments of teat stimulation: i) washing of the teats with water for about 5 s and attaching of the <b>milking</b> <b>unit</b> within 60 s, without any pre-milking massage (farm milking routine); ii) fast pulsation (FP), achieved by increasing pulsation rate to 120 pulsations per min during the first 60 s after application of teat cups. Each treatment lasted for 10 days and the following parameters were measured: milk yield (kg/milking), milk yield at 2 min after unit attachment (kg), time between <b>milking</b> <b>unit</b> attachment and its automatic removal (min), peak milk flow rate (kg/min), and milking time to reach peak flow rate (min). The average milk flow rate (kg/min) was calculated by dividing milk yield by the actual milking time. Milk yield was not affected by mechanical pre-stimulation and during the first 2 min of milking 20. 2 % and 19. 6 % of total milk yield were milked respectively when treatments 1 and 2 were applied. The time elapsed from attachment of the milking cluster until its automatic removal was less than 8 min both for buffaloes subjected to FP, and for buffaloes subjected just to washing of the teats before attaching the <b>milking</b> <b>unit.</b> FP stimulation did not show an enhancing effect on peak and average milk flow rates and on milking time to reach peak flow rate...|$|E

The percentage of milk produced by farms using automatic take-offs was 72.9 % and 77.0 % in 2005 and 2010, respectively. It appears that significant diffusion of the technology occurred up to 2005, with little additional diffusion thereafter. In 2010, large-scale, specialized, and educated farmers exhibited higher probability of using the technology. Furthermore, USDA certified organic or pasture-based operations had lower usage rates of 15.5 and 18.2 percentage points, respectively.
