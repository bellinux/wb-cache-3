50|$|The Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act {{was passed}} in 1975. Among other things, it {{regulated}} fishing licences, seasons, and size limits, and banned obstructing the salmon's <b>migratory</b> <b>paths.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s-1980s Lake Naivasha was overrun with poachers and foreign creatures {{introduced}} into the lake to provide fishing. The <b>migratory</b> <b>paths</b> along lake Naivasha were being destroyed by the local rose industry. Naturalist, Joan Root (1936-2006), spent {{the last decade of}} her life trying to save the lake and its wildlife.|$|E

50|$|Her {{work also}} showed that {{developing}} cortical neurons {{use a variety of}} different <b>migratory</b> <b>paths</b> as they move from their birthplace to their final destination in the cortex. This work stood in contrast to a prevailing theory at the time, which was that all neuronal migration in the cortex was dependent upon radial glia.|$|E
5000|$|The {{goal of the}} Pelican Path Project {{has been}} to improve Seabrook’s {{identity}} as a community {{and one of the}} largest <b>migratory</b> <b>paths</b> in North America, and a bird sanctuary to both the brown and white pelicans. The project also displays connectedness of the city by its many bed and breakfasts, close family values, available water attractions and its unique downtown of small businesses.|$|E
5000|$|Magnetoreception is well {{documented}} in honey bees, ants and termites. [...] In ants and bees, this is used to orient and navigate in areas around their nests and within their <b>migratory</b> <b>paths.</b> For example, {{through the use of}} magnetoreception, the Brazilian stingless bee Schwarziana quadripunctata is able to distinguish differences in altitude, location, and directionality using the thousands of hair-like particles on its antennae.|$|E

50|$|Within the 289-acre {{wildlife}} sanctuary, {{visitors can}} explore trails, {{sit in on}} educational programs, and get their hands dirty with conservation projects. The Heard sanctuary has five habitats including Blackland prairie, wetlands, bottomland forest, upland forest and white rock escarpment. The Heard has been awarded The Audubon Society's designation as an important birding area. Texas has preeminence as a bird-watching area due to its placement on major <b>migratory</b> <b>paths.</b> However, The Heard offers special opportunities for bird-watching by providing a unique resource in a large metropolitan area.|$|E
5000|$|Miner {{was one of}} {{the first}} conservationists to {{determine}} the <b>migratory</b> <b>paths</b> of birds. In August 1909, he constructed a successful duck trap. His subject was banding with his own hand-stamped aluminum band. [...] Along with address information, his bird tags quoted scripture: [...] "Keep yourselves in the love of God—Jude 1-21" [...] and [...] "With God all things are possible—Mark 10-27". Late that year, his original band was recovered in Anderson, South Carolina. This marked the first complete record for banding migratory birds.|$|E
50|$|Climate {{change could}} be causing {{migration}} patterns to shift into {{an earlier time}} frame, coinciding with an earlier start of the growing period. This means that migratory species may leave lower altitudes for higher-altitude breeding sites while those breeding sites still lack the necessary resources. Some species that have shorter <b>migratory</b> <b>paths</b> {{may be able to}} return to the lower elevations and wait, but run the risk of running out of the resources in that lower altitude, such as food and cover, that may only be available for a short, set period of time.|$|E

50|$|Mammals have a <b>migratory</b> <b>path</b> {{comparable}} to that in Xenopus. Migration begins with 50 gonocytes and about 5,000 PGCs arrive at the gonads. Proliferation occurs also during migration and lasts for 3-4 weeks in humans.|$|R
50|$|The Damonte Ranch {{is also a}} {{place where}} {{numerous}} birds reside and migrate through. Northern Nevada is a <b>migratory</b> <b>path</b> of harlequin duck, cackling goose, red-necked grebe, and medium-sized diurnal birds of prey, white-tailed kite, broad-winged hawk.|$|R
50|$|Large white {{butterfly}} migration patterns are typically observed {{only when there}} is a disturbance. In general, the large {{white butterfly}}'s migratory patterns are atypical; normally, butterflies fly towards the poles in the spring, and towards the more temperate Equator during the fall. However, they fly in random directions, excluding north, in the spring, and there is little return migration observed. However, it has been hard to track entire <b>migratory</b> <b>paths,</b> since these butterflies can migrate more than 800 kilometres; thus, individual butterflies may not migrate the 800 kilometres, but rather that other butterflies start their migrations from where the other butterflies ended.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} half of {{the reservation}} is open plains and the northern portion resides in the treed Rocky Mountains. Mammals and birds <b>migratory</b> <b>paths</b> cross the reservation seasonally, including mountain lion, black bear, elk, Canadian Geese and turkey. Rainbow, brown and cutthroat trout are stocked in seven lakes on the reservation, but annual conditions such as low precipitation result in high pH-levels. From 1995 to 2000 the lake levels were severely low due to drought; As a result, most of the fish were killed off during those years. The reservation sits on the San Juan Basin, which is rich in fossil fuels. The basin is the largest producer of oil along the Rocky Mountains and the second largest producer of natural gas in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|For a {{long time}} the Pyrenean Mastiff {{accompanied}} the herds of sheep in its <b>migratory</b> <b>paths</b> from the Aragonese and Navarrese Pyrenees until Maestrazgo. Its main function was to guard and protect the herds and its masters from the attacks of wolves, bears and thieves.During the 20th century, especially after the Spanish Civil War, due to economic difficulties, the mastiff went into decline as it was very expensive to keep a dog of its size. In the 1970s a group of fans started a job of recovery of the breed through the few specimens {{that were in the}} countryside and still had typical features of the ancient mastiff. It has been documented since 1977 as a modern purebred breed by the Club del Mastín del Pirineo de España in Spain.|$|E
50|$|Cheynes Beach Whaling Station is {{now called}} Whale World, a popular tourist destination. Whale {{watching}} from Albany centres on humpback whales close to shore. Sperm whales are rarely seen as their <b>migratory</b> <b>path</b> takes them on a course parallel to the coast line and along the continental shelf.|$|R
50|$|The Queensland {{lungfish}} {{is essentially}} a sedentary species, spending its life within a restricted area. Its home range rarely extends beyond a single pool or, occasionally, two adjacent pools. It does not follow a set <b>migratory</b> <b>path,</b> but may actively seek out suitable spawning habitats between July and December.|$|R
5|$|Fishing {{industry}} is a major enterprise as Romblon is surrounded by water on all sides. The fishing grounds of Romblon are a <b>migratory</b> <b>path</b> of fish from Sulu and Visayan Seas passing Tablas Strait, Sibuyan Sea and Romblon Pass. The waters also abound with demersal fish due to the coral reefs surrounding the islands.|$|R
50|$|One of {{his most}} recent {{research}} interests is in “Hindu Sufism” in Pakistan and India. To start out, Michel Boivin retraced the <b>migratory</b> <b>paths</b> of Sindhi Hindus, then researched their Sufi rituals in order to evaluate {{the extent to which}} they had to change to adapt to their new environment. In parallel, he has begun work on collecting the publications and manuscripts on Sufism in the Sindhi language. Despite his emphasis on historical anthropology, Michel Boivin continues to work on the appearance of new forms of knowledge in the 19th century. He is particularly interested in the production of a new culture in the Sindh province as a result of interaction between British colonial rule, the emergence of new elites and the objectification of Sufism. His work is therefore to be understood as a continuation of postcolonial studies, as he is engaged in reconstructing the evolution of the “Sufi culture of Sindh” based on archival work carried out in the Indian sub-continent and in Europe.|$|E
50|$|In 1980, {{during a}} Bakke Mountain hike, the Bakke family noticed {{the region was}} quite breezy. The sparse tree growth was {{misshapen}} and deformed by the strong winds. Hans Bakke began {{to consider the possibility}} of wind energy at the site. EnXco, the wind-energy company and partner of the French energy conglomerate Électricité de France, approached the Bakke family to propose building a wind farm, together they created Hoosac Wind LLC. In November 2004, the State of Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection approved the proposed project. However, thorny issues plague the project including the presence of potentially vulnerable species of goldenrod {{in the vicinity of the}} proposed site, as well as the asserted danger to the <b>migratory</b> <b>paths</b> of birds and bats. Hoosac Wind achieved tentative approval from both Florida and Monroe after taking considerable amounts of wind-speed and direction data, along with avian, archeological, geological, and wildlife studies which were conducted as well. In January 2006, Hoosac Wind LLC was purchased by the British company PPM Energy for an estimated US$40 million, PPM was subsequently absorbed by Iberdrola Renewables. Hoosac Wind LLC was renamed New England Wind LLC. Green Berkshires, an environmental organization opposed to wind energy projects in the Berkshire mountain range, had filed an appeal rejected by the State of Massachusetts Division of Administrative Law Appeals. As of May, 2008, the project was still under review post environmental standards challenges. The project began construction in early 2012 and was completed in December 2012.|$|E
50|$|Since then, the {{construction}} of fish cages {{has long been a}} problem for the river's natural ecology. The fish cages, often spanning the width of the entire river, physically block the natural <b>migratory</b> <b>paths</b> of fish species that move between the lake and the sea. The presence of the wooden structures also impede and disrupt the river's natural currents, slowing down the flow of water and creating stagnant spots in the river. By 2002, a high of 623 fish cages were recorded by a census group. Over the years, numerous measures have been attempted to curb the growing number of illegal fish cages in the river. In 1996, fish cages and other aquaculture elements in the river (and the adjoining lake) were ordered removed through an official executive order. Some of the reasons cited referred to pollution of the river caused by effluent waste from the fish pens. The structures were also said to physically impede the progress of native fish migrating up and down the river. Protected area status was granted to the river with the enactment of the National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) Act in 1996. Another attempt to clear the river was pursued in 2002. A record 623 cages were dismantled during that effort. Less than a decade after, in 2007 cages were found to have been reconstructed in significant amounts throughout the length of the river. This culminated in the latest river-clearing effort in mid-2008 by a special task force appointed for the job. A total of 96 illegal fish cages were removed in June 2008, the number of which had already dropped from the previous year's tally of more than 150 cages. As of July 2008, no fish pens remain within the river's waters.|$|E
