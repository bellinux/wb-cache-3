40|$|We {{describe}} {{a simple and}} versatile method to manipulate the amplitude of the <b>magnetron</b> <b>orbit</b> of ions stored in a Penning trap, applied here to a cloud of low energy positrons. By applying a pulsed voltage to a split electrode in the trap, which is normally used for rotating wall compression of the particles, {{the size of the}} <b>magnetron</b> <b>orbit</b> can be changed at will. The modified orbit {{has been shown to be}} stable for many magnetron periods. The technique could find use in applications which require off-axis ejection of particles, for instance in the filling of arrays of traps for multicell positron storage...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the demonstration of}} a new technique that allows masses to be compared with fractional uncertainty at or below 1 x 10 - 11, {{an order of magnitude}} improvement over our previous results. By confining two different ions in a Penning trap we can now simultaneously measure the ratio of their two cyclotron frequencies, making our mass comparisons insensitive to many sources of fluctuations (e. g. of the magnetic field). To minimize the systematic error associated with the Coulomb interaction between the two ions, we keep them about 1 mm apart from each other, on a common <b>magnetron</b> <b>orbit.</b> We have developed novel techniques to measure and control all three normal modes of motion of each ion, including the two strongly coupled magnetron modes. With the help of a new computer control system we have characterized the electric field anharmonicities and magnetic field inhomogeneities to an unprecedented level of precision. This allows us to optimize the trap so that our measurement of the cyclotron frequency ratio is to first order insensitive to the field imperfections. Using the ions 13 C 2 H 2 + and 14 N 2 +, we performed many tests of our understanding of the ions dynamics and of the various sources of errors in this technique. From these we conclude {{that there should be no}} systematic error in our measurements at the level of 5 x 10 - 12. Thus we feel confident reporting a value for the mass ratio of these ions with an uncertainty of 10 - 11. (cont.) In this thesis, we also report measurements of the two mass ratios m[33 S+]/m[32 SH+] and m[29 Si+]/m[28 SiH+] with a relative uncertainty of less than 10 - 1 l, which makes them the best known mass ratios to date. These can be combined with precise measurements of high-energy gamma-rays to provide a direct test of the relation E = mc 2. This is a test of special relativity which does not rely on the assumption of a preferred reference frame. The uncertainty on the atomic mass of 29 Si is also reduced by about an order of magnitude. by Simon Rainville. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Physics, 2003.

40|$|We have {{improved}} {{the ability to}} compare the masses of single ions by {{an order of magnitude}} to a fractional accuracy of [approx. ] 7 x 10 - 12. This is done by simultaneously confining two ions in a Penning trap, and simultaneously comparing their cyclotron frequencies which are inversely proportional to the masses. The precision of the previous technique of alternately trapping the two ions was completely limited by magnetic field noise. Our new technique reduces the impact of both magnetic field and trap voltage noise by more than three orders of magnitude. We can measure and control the relative motion of the two ions in the Penning trap. We have developed a new mode coupling technique to park the ions on a shared <b>magnetron</b> <b>orbit</b> of diameter 1 mm but {{on opposite sides of the}} trap. We superpose on top of this magnetron motion the small cyclotron orbits of 150 [mu] diameter needed to simultaneously compare the cyclotron frequencies. The Coulomb interaction keeps the separation of the cyclotron guiding centers constant, thus minimizing cyclotron frequency perturbations due to ion-ion interactions. The ions spatially average magnetic field inhomogeneities and electrostatic imperfections at the magnetron frequency of 5 kHz. We have developed techniques to precisely measure and systematically vary the ion-ion separation. The control techniques are critical for exploring systematic errors. (cont.) We discovered that we are sensitive to induced charge distributions within our molecular ions. As an ion moves on its cyclotron motion, it experiences a motional electric field which can polarize the ion. The induced charge distribution then leads to a systematic cyclotron frequency shift. Since the polarizability of the ion depends on its quantum state, we can monitor the quantum rotational state of a single CO+ molecule by measuring its cyclotron frequency. From the size of the observed cyclotron frequency shifts between rotational states, we determine the electric dipole moment of the CO+ to be 1. 025 (15) eao. This novel example of a polarization force has not been observed previously. by James K. Thompson. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Physics, 2003.
