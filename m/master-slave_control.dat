30|$|Currently, the {{two main}} ways of {{microgrid}} control are peer-to-peer control and <b>master-slave</b> <b>control</b> [4, 5, 6, 7]. The technology of peer-to-peer control has high requirement for coordination control of DG and is still confined to the laboratory; <b>master-slave</b> <b>control</b> has high requirement for communication, demanding not only reliability but also real-time performance, and considerably relies on computer system and communication, and its timeliness needs to be demonstrated [8, 9]. <b>Master-slave</b> <b>control</b> is further divided into two-layer control or three-layer control, which are used by most pilot projects {{at home and abroad}} and lay emphasis on coordinating the operation of DG and load within microgrid [10]. Ref. [11] presents a decentralized control method which makes use of the local information of DG within microgrid. This control method can solve the problems of distributed generator and load within microgrid of being dispersive, but it is unable {{to take full advantage of}} the generation complementarities of DG within microgrid. Ref. [14] presents a <b>master-slave</b> <b>control</b> strategy from a microgrid energy management perspective. It relies too heavily on communication and doesn’t consider control methods in particular conditions. Ref. [15] presents power management methods and controller design details within microgrid according to output characteristics of different types of DG, but mentions nothing about access control method of microgrid.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} bus voltage regulation, two commonly-used {{methods have been}} proposed. The first one is the droop control method. This is a simple technique to achieve current sharing. The bus voltage is first measured, and afterwards {{the amount of energy}} that each source will supply is calculated [22]. The second method is <b>master-slave</b> <b>control.</b> This technique depends on communication between converters: a master controller regulates the DC voltage and sends the set-points to the other converters [23, 24, 25], with a very good load sharing ability even if the converters are not identical. However, neither the droop control, which has an inevitable disadvantage of bus voltage deviation, nor a common <b>master-slave</b> <b>control,</b> which requires communication between converters, is able to provide a comprehensive solution to the DC bus regulation together with the partial shading problems or PV module failures with an appropriate control strategy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — An {{innovative}} bilateral <b>master-slave</b> <b>control</b> {{method for}} an upper limb rehabilitation robot system which can afford training for hemiplegic patients is introduced. The system {{consists of two}} identical motors with the master motor working in the generating state and the slave motor working in the electromotion state. Based on hemi-disabled characteristic of hemiplegic patients, the healthy limb is used to operate the master motor to generate electric energy, which in turn powers the slave motor to rotate and support impaired limb in motion imitation, thus realizing rehabilitation training. An experimental prototype with energy supplement control was developed. The appropriate amount of energy is provided for the master-slave closed-loop circuit to compensate the inside energy loss, and further to achieve good motion tracking performance. Test experiments were conducted and the results confirm that the proposed system is capable of achieving motion tracking, energy recycling, and force sensing without force sensors.

40|$|There {{are several}} {{situations}} where tasks {{can be performed}} better robotically rather than manually. Among these are situations (a) where high accuracy and robustness are required, (b) where difficult or hazardous working conditions exist, and (c) where very large or very small motions or forces are involved. Recent advances in technology have resulted in smaller size robots with higher accuracy and reliability. As a result, robotics is fi nding more and more applications in Biomedical Engineering. Medical Robotics and Cell Micro-Manipulation are two of these applications involving interaction with delicate living organs at very di fferent scales. Availability {{of a wide range}} of imaging modalities from ultrasound and X-ray fluoroscopy to high magni cation optical microscopes, makes it possible to use imaging as a powerful means to guide and control robot manipulators. This thesis includes three parts focusing on three applications of Image-Guided Robotics in biomedical engineering, including: Vascular Catheterization: a robotic system was developed to insert a catheter through the vasculature and guide it to a desired point via visual servoing. The system provides shared control with the operator to perform a task semi-automatically or through <b>master-slave</b> <b>control.</b> The system provides control of a catheter tip with high accuracy while reducing X-ray exposure to the clinicians and providing a more ergonomic situation for the cardiologists.

40|$|Low-voltage microgrids {{can be seen}} as {{the basic}} tiles of the smart grid {{patchwork}} owing to their capability to efficiently manage the distributed energy resources (DERs) in aggregate form. They can support the grid in terms of demand response, power quality, ride through capability, and at the same time, they can ensure electrical continuity to the loads, even in case of grid failure. This paper describes a simple and effective approach to manage microgrids by synergistic control of the power electronic interfaces acting therein, i. e., the utility interface (UI), installed at the point of common coupling with the utility and the energy gateways (EGs), interfacing the DERs with the distribution grid. The proposed <b>master-slave</b> <b>control</b> uses the UI as control master for the EGs. In grid-connected operation, the UI performs as a grid-supporting unit and dispatches active and reactive power references to the EGs so as to improve energy efficiency and power quality; in islanded operation, the UI performs as a grid-forming voltage source and ensures the power balance by exploiting every power source and energy storage unit available in the microgrid.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} of grasp planning for robotic dexterous hands. <b>Master-slave</b> <b>control</b> strategy is adopted for integrating human intelligence into the planning system in which human hand directly controls the robot hand interactively. The human-machine interface is a computer vision system with two CCD cameras. The fingertips of the human hand are marked with markers of different geometry, thus can be identified by the computer vision system. When the human fingers move, the vision system firstly captures {{the image of the}} markers and performs feature-based identification. Then the images of the two cameras are matched and their image centers are used to calculate the positions of the fingertips. After this the human fingertip positions are mapped onto those of the dexterous hand in its palm frame. The human operator observes the motions of the robot fingers and decides the next step of motion. Through this procedure the human hand can guide the robot fingers to the target position of grasping and manipulation. To verify the validity of the proposed grasp planning approach, two tasks are demonstrated in a virtual environment, one is pressing a button with a single finger and the other is moving the thumb and index fingers. The tasks are simulated in real time and performed successfully. Key words: computer vision, grasp planning, multi-fingered dexterous hand, <b>master-slave</b> <b>control...</b>|$|E
