It {{works like a}} rotating electric motor whose stator is [...] "unrolled" [...] along {{the underside of the}} guideway; instead of producing torque (rotation) it produces a linear force along its length. The electromagnets in the maglev vehicle which lift it also work as the equivalent of the excitation portion (rotor) of this linear electric motor. Since the <b>magnetic</b> <b>travelling</b> <b>field</b> works in only one direction, if there were to be several maglev trains on a given track section, they would all travel in the same direction thereby reducing the possibility of collision between moving trains.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A coupled {{system of}} a magnet and {{magnetic}} fluid {{is used as}} a piston in a U-tube. Applying reciprocating <b>travelling</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> produces reciprocating motion of the coupled system. In this study, vibration properties of the coupled system are investigated experimentally. Three types of vibration mode of the coupled system appear and the mode depends on the frequency and intensity of <b>travelling</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and the shape of the magnet. Basically the coupled system follows the <b>travelling</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> in the range of low frequency, while the system cannot follow the <b>travelling</b> <b>field</b> when the frequency of the <b>travelling</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is high. However, when the magnet is sphere or short cylinder, the other type of vibration appears in the range of low frequency and the coupled system intermittently tracks the <b>travelling</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field...</b>|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The <b>travelling</b> <b>magnetic</b> wave of a linear induction motor induces eddy currents in a secondary circuit (usually a sheet consisting at least partly of a non-magnetic metal, often aluminium), which cause the unrestrained member to move linearly {{in the direction of}} the travelling wave. A linear motor can also transport ferromagnetic powder, although this travels in the opposite direction to the <b>travelling</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> The motion is therefore due to a mechanism other than the eddy currents flowing in the sheet secondary. Expressions for the forces acting on an iron particle due to a <b>travelling</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> are derived in the thesis. Preliminary experiments support the assumptions made in the derivations of the force expressions and lead to the formation of an hypothesis. This is shown to be capable of predicting both linear and rotational particle speeds and, with greater accuracy, the distance travelled and the rotation experienced by the particles. Experiments conducted on tubular and transverse flux motors have enabled different linear motors to be identified as suitable for a number of powder transportation applications. The results obtained show also the importance of large flux density values, the tangential to normal flux density ratio and large pole-pitch winding arrangements, with the latter lending support to the original hypothesis. The results of a finite element investigation of the tubular motor did not closely agree with the results from the experimental motor although similar trends were evident. Flux density values within particles were found to be considerably greater than those outside, as assumed in the hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, we have reported numerical simulations of the MHD flow {{driven by a}} <b>travelling</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> (TMF) in an annular channel, at low Reynolds number. It was shown that the stalling of such induction pump is strongly related to magnetic flux expulsion. In the present article, we show that for larger hydrodynamic Reynolds number, and with more realistic boundary conditions, this instability {{takes the form of}} a large axisymmetric vortex flow in the (r,z) -plane, in which the fluid is locally pumped in the direction opposite to the one of the magnetic field. Close to the marginal stability of this vortex flow, a low-frequency pulsation is generated. Finally, these results are compared to theoretical predictions and are discussed within the framework of experimental annular linear induction electromagnetic pumps...|$|R
40|$|The MHD flow {{driven by}} a <b>travelling</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> (TMF) in an annular channel is {{investigated}} numerically. For sufficiently large magnetic Reynolds number Rm, or if a large enough pressure gradient is externally applied, the system undergoes an instability in which the flow rate in the channel dramatically drops from synchronism with the wave to much smaller velocities. This transition {{takes the form of}} a saddle-node bifurcation for the time-averaged quantities. In this first paper, we characterize the bifurcation, and study the stability of the flow as a function of several parameters. We show that the bifurcation of the flow involves a bistability between Poiseuille-like and Hartman-like regimes, and relies on magnetic flux expulsion. Based on this observation, new predictions are made for the occurrence of this stalling instability. Comment: 14 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

However, creating an edge-channel interferometer in which electron-electron interactions play an important role requires a clean system and long phase coherence lengths. Here we realize electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometers with record visibilities of up to 98 % using spin- and valley-polarized edge channels that co-propagate along a PN junction in graphene. We find that inter-channel scattering between same-spin edge channels along the physical graphene edge can be used to form beamsplitters, while the absence of inter-channel scattering along gate-defined interfaces can be used to form isolated interferometer arms. Surprisingly, our interferometer is robust to dephasing effects at energies an order of magnitude larger than observed in pioneering experiments on GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells. Our results shed light on the nature of edge-channel equilibration and open up new possibilities for studying exotic electron statistics and quantum phenomena. Comment: 18 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSilicon is {{the most}} widely used {{semiconductor}} for photovoltaic solar cells, arid also the most extensively studied. The need for cost reduction lead solar cell producers to look for cheaper raw silicon, allowing a higher impurity content in the charge used as input for crystallization and making it very different from the extensively studied electronic-grade silicon. In order to keep a good efficiency of the solar cells, the impurities that have a huge impact over the electrical properties of the material should be removed born the final ingot. Controlling the segregation of impurities during the solidification is therefore mandatory. A study of the solidification of metallurgical grade silicon under controlled solidification parameters such as growth rate, thermal gradient and forced convection flow was conducted in a Bridgman set-up. Forced convection was induced by a <b>travelling</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> (TMF) during the solidification, and resulted in a mixing of excess impurities in the liquid, removing them from the vicinity of the solidification front.

The potential benefits of using magnetic fields to help control the flow pattern include fewer surface and internal defects, refined microstructure, improved uniformity, fewer inclusions, increased productivity and reduction in mold copper wear, especially at higher casting speeds.

Numerical models are the best tool for optimizing electromagnetic flow control, but the complexities of transient turbulent flow and the accompanying phenomena which govern defects make accurate predictions very difficult.

The two fields are tied together with the aether to form simple electric circuit capable of transferring power. However, when these two fields are measured in what is called the near field (much less than the wavelength of the signal) very strange things happen. (Also see Capps “Near Field or Far Field"). E and H are no longer connected in a simple predictable manner. The value of c (speed of light) and the resistance of the aether are altered and it is possible to produce large H values with low E values.
