40|$|There {{is growing}} policy concern {{regarding}} {{the competitiveness of}} small-scale livestock production {{in the wake of}} the contemporary livestock revolution in many developing countries. In Kenya, this debate has focused on economies of scale and the undue influence of policy distortions on promoting the scaling up of dairy farms. This paper seeks to investigate economies of scale in Kenyan dairy in terms of relative profit efficiency at different levels of output, and identify policy and technology options to help small-scale farmers develop solutions to the challenges of competition. Data were collected from 204 dairy producers of different farm sizes in rural Kiambu and Thika, and urban Nairobi districts and a stochastic frontier model approach was used to analyze the determinants of profitability and inefficiency. Unit profitability per farm ranged between US$ 0. 13 - US$ 0. 16 per liter of milk with no significant variation across scales of farm. However, at all given levels of scale of farm, inefficiency significantly contributed to variability in profitability across farms. Scale had no significant effect on efficiency, confirming the relative competitiveness of small-scale dairy producers. Dairy farmers with commercial poultry achieved higher relative profit efficiency as poultry waste was fed to cattle. Rural location relative to Nairobi also increased efficiency. Linking rural areas and major market centre with good roads, strengthening of farmers' co-operative societies and exploring use of cheaper raw materials in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentrate</b> feeds may strengthen the competitive position small dairy farms versus large ones.

40|$|AbstractThis thesis {{evaluated}} {{the basis of}} calcium-protein interactions in casein systems {{in order to develop}} novel casein-based food matrices with different structures and functionalities. Initially, in Chapter 2 the effects of calcium chelating salts (CCS) (disodium phosphate and trisodium citrate) on calcium-ion activity (ACa++), calcium distribution and protein solubility were investigated in model CaCl 2 solutions (50 mmol L- 1) and rennet casein dispersions (12 % w/w). In both model systems, adding trisodium citrate either alone or as part of a mixed chelating salt system resulted in high levels of dispersed “chelated” calcium; conversely, disodium phosphate addition resulted in lower levels, while the ACa++ decreased with increasing concentration of both CCS. Addition of either salt resulted in only a modest increase in soluble protein. Hence, the results suggested that CCS may play a more subtle role in modulating hydration during <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> casein-based matrices than simply solubilising calcium or protein. Therefore, {{despite the fact that the}} rennet casein dispersion used was relatively concentrated, an even more concentrated protein system was required to clarify the role of calcium chelators in casein hydration and matrix formation during <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentrated</b> casein-based food matrices e. g. processed and analogue cheese. Hence, this work was further built upon in Chapter 3, where a small-scale manufacturing protocol for concentrated casein-based food matrices was developed using a Thermomix. Manufacture was stopped at various time-points, and the matrix formed and any free liquid still remaining were collected. The dispersed and insoluble phases were separated by centrifugation and the calcium (total calcium and ACa++) and protein contents of the dispersed phase analysed. The levels of calcium in the dispersed phase increased and ACa++ decreased during <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> casein matrices formulated with CCS; ~ 23 % of the total calcium was solubilised by the end <b>of</b> <b>manufacture.</b> In the absence of CCS, the levels of calcium solubilised were significantly (P 0. 05) detected between matrices containing half or reduced fat levels for any of these attributes. In Chapter 6 CCS-free casein-based matrices prepared with different types of lipid (i. e. milk fat or rapeseed oil) were formulated with high (774 mg. 100 g- 1) or low (357 mg. 100 g- 1) calcium levels again by blending rennet and acid casein. Their physico-chemical characteristics (i. e. composition, texture, microstructure and water mobility) and in vitro digestibility were compared to conventionally formulated high-calcium (723 mg. 100 g- 1) casein matrices made from rennet casein with CCS. The CCS-free, high-calcium matrices were significantly (P < 0. 05) softer than those with low calcium levels and showed the highest rates of disintegration during simulated gastric digestion. Despite having a higher moisture-to -protein ratio, the high-calcium matrices containing CCS had broadly similar hardness values to those of high-calcium concentration prepared without CCS, but had higher cohesiveness. The high-calcium matrices containing CCS had quite a different microstructure and increased water mobility compared to those made without CCS and showed the slowest rate (P < 0. 05) of disintegration in the gastric environment. Gastric resistance was shown to be unaffected by the type of lipid phase present in the matrix. Conversely, fatty acid release was similar for all casein matrices prepared from milk fat, however, high-calcium matrices (CCS-free) prepared from rapeseed oil showed higher lipolysis. The results demonstrated that modifying the composition (i. e. calcium concentration, moisture to protein ratio, inclusion of CCS) and consequently the physical characteristics (e. g. texture, microstructure and water mobility) of casein-based food matrices affects their behavior during in vitro digestion. In particular, the results obtained showed that the physical properties of such matrices could be modified to alter resistance to gastric degradation which may have consequences for the kinetics of nutrient release and delivery of bioactives sentitive to the gastric environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{present report}} {{contains}} {{the data collected}} in 2007, pursuant to Section 21 German Transfusion Act, and {{an analysis of the}} supply situation over the past 8 years. As in previous years, all blood donation centres located in Germany transmitted data on the collection, manufacture, import and export of blood components for transfusion. According to these data, a total of 6. 7 million blood collections were performed in 2007. With 4. 7 million, the portion of whole blood donations was at the level of previous years, whereas the number of apheresis donations rose again, to 1. 9 million. The portion of autologous blood collections accounts for only 1. 1 % and thus continues to decline. Since 2003, the number of red blood cell concentrates prepared has been a constant 4. 5 million transfusion units. The decay of red blood cell concentrates on the user side in 2000 accounted for 5 % while in 2007 it was just above 3 %, referred to the total quantity of data reported as transfused and decayed. The <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> platelet <b>concentrates</b> rose from 366, 000 to 480, 000 transfusion units between 2003 and 2007. The production of therapeutic single plasmas, too, markedly increased in 2007 (to 1. 2 million transfusion units). In 2007, 2. 2 million I of plasma for fractionation were collected in Germany. In addition, 1. 0 million I were imported, and 1. 8 million I were exported. The quantity available in Germany from a pure arithmetic point of view of 1. 4 million I was almost entirely allocated to basic fractionation so that a sufficient plasma supply can be assumed. Due to the fact that manufacturing capacities are still lacking in Germany, recombinant factors need to be imported in their entirety. Since 2003, Germany has by far been the leader in Europe with more than 20 I of fractionation plasma collected per 1, 000 inhabitants. Furthermore, regarding the manufacturing figures of red blood cell concentrates, platelet concentrates, and therapeutic single plasma, Germany is in the top third for all these products compared with other European countries. The <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> allogeneic stem cell products for haematopoietic reconstitution, obtained by apheresis, has continuously risen to 4, 700.
