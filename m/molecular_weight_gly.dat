40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a study on the kinetics of nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization of styrene with a unimolecular initiator. The primary objective was to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of how a unimolecular-initiating system controls the polymerization process and to clarify the effects of various reaction parameters. Previous work in this field has met with some difficulties in the initiator synthesis, such as low yield and inconsistency of <b>molecular</b> <b>weight.</b> These problems were overcome by adjusting reaction conditions and procedures. Better yields of initiator with consistent <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> were produced by the improved methods. Control of polymerization rate and polymer <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> in unimolecular nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization was studied by looking at the effects of the three main factors: initiator concentration, temperature, and the initiator <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> on polymerization rate, <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> and polydispersity. Results indicated that increasing the initiator concentration had no effect on polymerization rate at low conversion, but led to lower polymerization rate at high conversion; higher initiator concentration led to lower <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> of the resulting polymer. It was also found that temperature significantly increased the polymerization rate, yet had no effect on number-average <b>molecular</b> <b>weight,</b> Mn, at low conversion, while it caused a plateau at high conversion levels; there was no effect on weight-average <b>molecular</b> <b>weight,</b> Mw, through the whole conversion range. In addition, increasing initiator <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> was found to have no effect on either polymerization rate or <b>molecular</b> <b>weight.</b> The experimental <b>molecular</b> <b>weights</b> of the unimolecular system were compared to theoretical <b>molecular</b> <b>weights</b> based on ideal controlled radical polymerization (CRP). The results were found to be close to the theoretical values. This confirmed the advantages of the unimolecular system, namely, the degree of control over <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> was nearly ideal (for certain conditions); and <b>molecular</b> <b>weights</b> could thus be predicted by simply following general rules relating to CRP mechanisms...|$|R

Since the degree of polymerization is a function of reaction time, the desired <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> can be obtained by quenching the reaction at the appropriate time. However, the polymer obtained in this manner is unstable in that it leads to changes in <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> because the ends of the polymer molecule contain functional groups that can react further with each other.|$|R
40|$|The <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> of {{monodisperse}} {{human plasma}} low densitylipoprotein has been measured in 69 individuals {{and found to}} vary over the range of 2. 4 to 3. 9 X 10 - 6. By contrast, the <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> of low density lipoprotein measured on two separate occasions for specific individuals shows a mean difference of 0. 07 X 10 - 6 and {{a standard deviation of}} 0. 08 X 10 - 6; hence low density lipoprotein differing in <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> by greater than 0. 2 X 10 - 6 may be considered different macomolecules. The distribution of the <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> of low density lipoprotein does not differ as a function of age or sex. Hyperlipemic subjects having monodisperse low density lipoprotein show similar <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> distribution to normal subjects, as do subjects with premature coronary artery disease. Family studies reveal a correlation coefficient of 0. 82 between average <b>molecular</b> <b>weights</b> of parents and offspring, with significance at 0. 01. In order to assess the influence of environment on <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> of low density lipoprotein, the correlation coefficient between the fathers' and mothers' low density lipoprotein was measured and no statistically significant correlation was found. These data are interpreted as strong evidence for a genetic determination of <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> of low density lipoprotein. A study of individuals in five families yields <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> data consistent with a single gene locus genetic mode of inheritance without dominance. The regression coefficient of the mean low denisty lipoprotein parental <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> on the offspring <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> is 0. 30. If the variability of <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> is considered as an expression of phenotypic variance, then the regression analysis identified 30 % of this phenotypic variance as arising from additive gene action presumably at a single locus. Segregation in the family data is consistent. Since the differences in <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> of low density lipoprotein arise from differences in the amount of lipid bound to the apoprotein, it is likely that an additional portion of the phenotypic variance of the <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> results from individual variations in the metabolism of low density lipoprotein, which yield differences in lipid content. The individual variation in <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> is only approximately 5 %; hence those metabolic sequences that influence <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> of low density lipoproteins must be precisely controlled...|$|R
