Salts of ethylenebisdithiocarbamate are commercially significant fungicides under the brand names Maneb, <b>Mancozeb,</b> Zineb, and Metiram. Some imidazoline-containing fungicides are derived from ethylenediamine.|$|E
50|$|The {{disease is}} often {{controlled}} using fungicides such as <b>mancozeb,</b> maneb, or zineb.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mancozeb</b> {{is listed}} under FRAC code M3, {{considered}} a low risk group without {{any signs of}} resistance developing to the fungicide.|$|E
5000|$|Copper(II) sulfate {{is used as}} a {{fungicide}} and is {{also used}} in conventional agriculture (LD50 300 mg/kg). Conventional agriculture has the option to use the less toxic <b>Mancozeb</b> (LD50) ...|$|E
50|$|Dithiocarbamates {{specifically}} ethylene bisdithiocarbamates (EBDCs), in {{the form}} of complexes with manganese (maneb), zinc (zineb) or a combination of manganese and zinc (<b>mancozeb),</b> have been used extensively as fungicides in agriculture from the 1940s.|$|E
50|$|The least but not {{the less}} {{important}} management is the chemical control that ensure good control of the disease. The chemical control is basically spraying fungicide {{as soon as the}} symptoms are evident. Compounds registered for using are: chlorothalonil, maneb, <b>mancozeb</b> and copper.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, {{multiple}} fungicides {{have been}} seen to reduce Banana Freckle disease. In Hawaii, spraying the leaves and fruit with maneb (1 lb./100 gal water plus 4 oz of sticker-spreader) every 2 weeks or once a month throughout the year has remarkably reduced the spread of inoculum. In Taiwan, spraying fungicides, such as phaltan, orthocide, chlorothalonil, dithiocarbamates, and propiconazole, biweekly have produced effective results against the disease. In the Philippines, chemical controls used against Black or Yellow Sigatoka disease have been helpful. These consist of <b>mancozeb,</b> triazoles, tridemorph, and strobilurin. <b>Mancozeb</b> {{seems to be the}} most effective fungicide against Banana Freckle disease in Hawaii and the Philippines [...] These fungicides do not eliminate the pathogen completely, but they reduce the inoculum levels and eventually reduce yield loss.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{numerous}} fungicides {{on the market}} for controlling early blight. Some of the fungicides on the market are azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, Bacillus subtilis, chlorothalonil, copper products, hydrogen dioxide (Hydroperoxyl), <b>mancozeb,</b> potassium bicarbonate, and ziram. [...] Specific spraying regiments are found on the label. Labels for these products should be read carefully before applying.|$|E
5000|$|Chemical Control - Chemical {{control is}} highly {{recommended}} because downy mildew is an aggressive and destructive disease and satisfactory control {{without the use}} of fungicides is unlikely. Both protectant and systemic products should be applied. Fungicides are most effective when applied prior to infection and reapplied at 5- to 7-day intervals. The following products have proven to be the most effective fungicides in cucumber downy mildew control in North Carolina trials conducted annually from 2004 to 2008: Presidio (fluopicolide, Valent), Ranman (cyazofamid, FMC), Previcur Flex (propamocarb, Bayer), Curzate (cymoxanil, DuPont), Tanos (famoxadone and cymoxanil, DuPont),and Gavel (zoxamide and <b>mancozeb,</b> Dow AgroSciences). These products should be applied in a program to prevent pathogen resistance, that is, rotated with fungicides of a different mode of action. Protectant fungicides such as chlorothalonil and <b>mancozeb</b> should be used as mixing partners.|$|E
50|$|Fungicides applied {{specifically}} for downy mildew control may be unnecessary. Broad spectrum protectant fungicides such as chlorothalonil, <b>mancozeb,</b> and fixed copper {{are at least}} somewhat effective in protecting against downy mildew infection. Systemic fungicides are labeled for use against cucurbit downy mildew, but are recommended only after diagnosis of this disease has been confirmed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mancozeb</b> is a {{dithiocarbamate}} non-systemic agricultural fungicide with multi-site, {{protective action}} on contact. It {{is a combination}} of two other dithiocarbamates: maneb and zineb. The mixture controls many fungal diseases {{in a wide range of}} field crops, fruits, nuts, vegetables, and ornamentals. It is marketed as Penncozeb, Trimanoc, Vondozeb, Dithane, Manzeb, Nemispot, and Manzane.|$|E
5000|$|The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and United States Forest Service (USFS) {{attempt to}} prevent Phytophthora spread through road closures, monitoring, {{research}} and education. Research {{has focused on}} determining the dynamics and mechanisms of spread, as well as attempts to breed resistant trees.The solution against Phytophtera is known as <b>Mancozeb</b> also commercially known as Dithane (C) ...|$|E
50|$|Under normal {{conditions}} in Hawaii {{it is estimated}} that without control of black sigatoka yield losses would be 30%. Sigatoka is controlled with a combination of protectant and systemic fungicides in order to prevent resistance from developing. <b>Mancozeb</b> is applied as the primary protectant and fenbuconazole, tebuconazole, and azoxystrobin are applied as systemic fungicides. These fungicides are applied during summer.|$|E
50|$|Bacterial leaf spot, {{which causes}} vein clearing, forms bright yellow colonies causing {{infection}} and leaf wilt and, eventually, deterioration of fruit pulp, especially of young fruits. Under favorable {{conditions for the}} bacteria, infection occurs through natural openings or wounds from other pathogens that affect leaf inter-cellular spaces. Fertilizers or a copper chloride and <b>mancozeb</b> mixture can control {{the intensity of the}} disease, but are not a cure.|$|E
50|$|Leaf blight {{occurs in}} areas with hot and humid weather. The spores land on onion leaves, {{penetrate}} the skin, and rapidly kill the leaf. This causes a severe reduction in bulb size, as high as 50%, and can happen {{in less than a}} week. Applications of foliar fungicides can be used to control leaf blight. These include azoxystrobin, chlorotholonil copper, <b>mancozeb,</b> maneb, and mefenoxam.|$|E
50|$|Peronospora manshurica infects soybeans, {{reducing}} photosynthetic activity, yield, and quality. The fungus spreads by oospores on diseased leaves and/or on infected seed. The disease spreads in environments {{with high}} humidity and favors temperatures between 20-22 Â°C. Tufts of grayish to pale-colored sporangiophores {{on the underside}} of leaves easily distinguish the infection from other foliar diseases. The disease is often controlled using the fungicides <b>mancozeb,</b> maneb, or zineb.|$|E
50|$|Rust {{primarily}} attacks {{plants in}} Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. The disease attacks {{during the summer}} months and causes yellow or orange spots to grow on the leaves of the cotton plant. These spots can cause defoliation, premature openings, broken stems, and reduced yield. Crops with severe outbreaks have been known to incur losses of up to 50%. This disease is controlled with applications of <b>mancozeb.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A most {{prominent}} derivative of ethylenediamine is the chelating agent EDTA, which {{is derived from}} ethylenediamine via a Strecker synthesis involving cyanide and formaldehyde. Hydroxyethylethylenediamine is another commercially significant chelating agent. [...] Numerous bio-active compounds and drugs contain the N-CH2-CH2-N linkage, including some antihistamines.

Some imidazoline-containing fungicides are derived from ethylenediamine.|$|E
50|$|Downy mildew left {{uncontrolled}} has {{the ability}} to reduce yields by up to 55% and infest up to 80% of plants. Downy mildew is primarily controlled through the use of several fungicides applied during midseason. The fungicides used include azoxystrobin, copper, chlorothalonil, <b>mancozeb,</b> and maneb. Farmers in Florida who regularly use fungicides have been shown to reduce yield losses due to downy mildew to as low as 2%.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{means of}} {{controlling}} Botryotinia polyblastis involve {{the use of}} fungicides. There are many varieties of fungicides available to prevent Botryotinia polyblastis infections {{and they should be}} applied twice throughout the season, once in late March and once in late April. Dicarboximide, chlorothalonil, fludioxonil, cyprodinil, pyraclostrobin and <b>mancozeb</b> are all common fungicides used to treat Narcissus fire, however formulations containing dicarboximide {{have been shown to be}} most effective.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} {{chemical}} control, broad spectrum, protectant fungicides such as chlorothalinil or <b>mancozeb</b> {{can be applied}} {{at the beginning of}} the growth season to prevent infection. Frequently once fruit have begun to grow, any further fungicide applications simply mask symptoms until post-harvest. During post-harvest treatment, harvested fruit are often coated with fungicides such as phenols or benzimidazoles to further protect against storage rot, especially on fruit being shipped overseas.|$|E
50|$|Cultural {{practices}} and fungicide use are two methods that grape growers use to reduce P. tetraspora. Removing leaf litter, increasing air circulation over {{the soil surface}} and canopy space, and removal of susceptible hosts from the immediate environment are some cultural practices that can help control P. tetraspora development. Because P. tetraspora survives on leaf litter, {{the removal of the}} litter before bud break can remove residual P. tetraspora. Apothecia of P. tetraspora require moisture to germinate and ascospores require moisture for dispersal, so increasing air circulation to the soil surface will detour P. tetraspora from getting to the host. Removal of other susceptible hosts of the Vitaceae family, like Parthenocissus quiniquefolia can reduce the likelihood of foreign P. tetraspora inoculum to enter where one doesn't want disease. Foliar fungicide sprays are recommended to control P. tetraspora because the ascospore lands on, infects, and penetrates the leaf. Products containing the fungicide <b>mancozeb</b> are generally used as a foliar spray for P. tetraspora control. <b>Mancozeb</b> disturbs the ascospores when they land on the plant tissue treated with the product.|$|E
50|$|Southern corn leaf blight {{thrives in}} the {{southern}} United States because unlike NCLB it requires warm weather to develop. During favorable conditions the disease has been documented ruining a whole crop within days when left untreated. Treatment is available {{with the use of}} chlorothalonil, <b>mancozeb,</b> and maneb but even this is limited. In one study in Florida even when a regular fungicide plan was followed over 25% of the ears were lost.|$|E
50|$|Smut {{is a tough}} {{disease of}} the onion because it can last for years in the soil as spores. When the onion crop is planted the spores {{germinate}} and enter the fresh seeds. When the plant grows lesions form on the leaf and any bulbs that form will be covered in black spots. Most of the time infected seeds will die within 3-5 weeks of planting. <b>Mancozeb</b> is recommended for treatment of smut.|$|E
50|$|Alternaria dianthia {{was first}} {{recorded}} in the scientific literature by F.L. Stevens and J.G. Hall in 1909, from florists in the United States. The fungus, along {{with other members of}} the Alternaria genus, is effectively controlled by the commercial fungicide <b>mancozeb,</b> as well as dithiocarbamtes, chlorotholonil, and iprodione. Although A. dianthi has been found in wild and commercial varieties of Dianthus plants worldwide, no studies of the economic impacts or losses due the disease have been published.|$|E
50|$|Applying {{fungicides}} {{that contain}} chlorothalonil, maneb, <b>mancozeb,</b> or metalaxyl {{as the main}} ingredient on a regular schedule will help to eliminate the pathogen. You can also apply fungicides containing mefenoxam to the soil surface under the vines around 4-8 weeks prior to harvest. A third practice to help control the disease is to spray with another fungicide, difolatan, 4 times over a 10-day period. Soil should be fumigated before anything else is planted in previously-infected soil.|$|E
50|$|Rust is {{very hard}} to treat. Fungicides such as <b>Mancozeb</b> or Triforine may help but may never {{eradicate}} the disease. Some organic preventative solutions are available and sulphur powder is known to stop germination. High standards of hygiene and good soil drainage and careful watering may minimise problems. Any appearance of rust must be immediately dealt with by removing and burning all affected leaves. Composting, or leaving infected vegetation on the ground will spread the disease.|$|E
50|$|Disease {{management}} can {{be difficult}} {{as it would be}} impossible to eliminate the alternate host grass species. However, the utilization of non-susceptible crops in a rotation can decrease infection rate in future cotton crops. An application of <b>Mancozeb</b> foliar fungicide can be used to prevent the disease, but little can be done after infection. This is not effective as a treatment, only as a prevention tool. Similarly, growers are proactive in their prevention of the disease, ensuring the proper fungicide applications.|$|E
50|$|Chemical control methods {{also hold}} promise for {{controlling}} Karnal bunt of wheat. In a 1986 study, Smilanick et al. {{were able to}} eradicate over 80% of Tilletia indica infection in wheat following two foliar applications of the fungicide propiconozole. The researchers had the same success using four foliar applications of the fungicides <b>mancozeb</b> or copper hydroxide. These chemical treatments were most effective when applied to host foliage 72 hours post-infection, but were not effective at all when applied to host seeds.|$|E
50|$|Alternaria {{leaf spot}} affects the cabbage plant by causing severe {{spotting}} and discoloration {{to the head}} of the plant. It is only a superficial effect to the plant but because of the black color of the leaf spots the marketability of a severely infected cabbage crop is low. Without control leaf spot is estimated to be able to reduce yields by up to 50%. Alternaria leaf spot is controlled using the same treatment as downy mildew: applications of azoxystrobin, copper, chlorothalonil, <b>mancozeb,</b> and maneb beginning midseason.|$|E
50|$|P. infestans {{is still}} a {{difficult}} disease to control. There are many chemical options in agriculture for the control of both damage to the foliage and infections of the tuber. A few {{of the most common}} foliar-applied fungicides are Ridomil, a Gavel/SuperTin tank mix, and Previcur Flex. All of the aforementioned fungicides need to be tank mixed with a broad-spectrum fungicide such as <b>mancozeb</b> or chlorothalonil not just for resistance management but also because the potato plants will be attacked by other pathogens at the same time.|$|E
5000|$|Alternaria mali {{prevention}} {{consists of}} strict quarantine, never importing plants or scions from affected plants and collecting fallen or infected leaves and burning them in winter. Apple cultivars can be ranked {{in order of}} increasing resistance as follows: Indo, Red Gold, Raritan, Delicious, Fuji, Golden Delicious, Ralls, Toko, Tsugaru, Mutsu, Jonagold, Jonathan. Chemical control uses fungicides such as iprodione, <b>mancozeb</b> and captan. [...] Disease severity is aggravated by severe mite infestation; thus good mite management {{is an important factor}} in preventing severe disease development.|$|E
50|$|Downy mildew is an {{extremely}} fast-developing disease in the onion. Studies have observed up to 40% of a field being infected {{in less than three}} days. The first symptoms of the disease are white and purple growths {{on the surface of the}} plant leaves. Eventually these leaves die. This in turn destroys the plant's photosynthetic abilities, stunting growth and sometimes killing the plant. Untreated downy mildew can reduce yields by 65%. Downy mildew is controlled with the same foliar fungicides as leaf blight: azoxystrobin, copper, <b>mancozeb,</b> maneb, and mefenoxam.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{control is}} often {{necessary}} to conserve yield. Chemical control targets the initial inoculum, {{reducing the amount}} of mycelium and sporangia present. In west Africa chemicals are applied using spray tanks. Fungicides such as copper oxychloride, <b>Mancozeb,</b> and Metalaxyl+Mancozeb are typically used. Mixtures of these chemicals can be used to prevent the pathogen from acquiring resistance to certain chemical compounds. Spraying is recommended four times a year from the last week of May {{to the end of the}} growing period. Growing a cocoa variety with resistance has an additive control effect with chemical control.|$|E
5000|$|Asparagus rust {{was first}} {{reported}} in the U.S. in 1896. It began on the asparagus crops of mostly northeastern states and began to move westward across the country- For each successive year the disease was discovered in new western areas until in 1902 it was reported in California for the first time. Research to control the disease began with Bordeaux mixture experiments around {{the start of the}} 20th century. Copper and sulfur dust were tried as well but their success was very limited. Sulfur was the only one to have much success at all. Rust resistant strains of asparagus were cultivated but by the 1940s and 1950s these strains of asparagus were no longer providing adequate levels of resistance. In the 1950s zineb and <b>mancozeb</b> were developed as the primary means to control rust. Zineb reduced infection by 85% and <b>mancozeb</b> by 97% [...] By 1989 EBDC fungicides had become the most common fungicidal means to control rust on asparagus. However, after the EPA almost cancelled the use of EBDCs on asparagus many processors decided they would not accept EBDC-treated asparagus despite the EPA allowing its use after review. This meant that many growers were left with no registered fungicide to use on asparagus. Since 1990 the EPA has granted exemptions for tebuconazole, myclobutanil, and triadimefon for use on asparagus.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{control of}} P. colocasiae has offered some {{relief in the}} form of {{preventative}} sprays containing copper, manganese, and zinc. The slanted shape of taro leaves, and prevalence of the crop in wet climates, necessitates numerous applications which may not be economically practical. The systemic fungicide metalaxyl has also been found to be effective in controlling P. colocasiae, especially when applied in conjunction with the pesticide <b>mancozeb</b> at the first sight of disease symptoms. While chemical control {{is one of the more}} effective methods of managing this pathogen, the fact that taro is usually a subsistence crop makes chemical control economically impractical and environmentally unsustainable.|$|E
