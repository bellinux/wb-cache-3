40|$|Abstract. Taking {{into account}} temperature-dependent thermal {{conduction}} and heat capacity, {{based in the}} research on the physical property of the material of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), a three-dimensional transient thermal finite element model has been developed in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM).

By the technique of element live and die on ANSYS software and using the nonlinear finite element method, several conclusions according to the simulation results were produced, first of all, the simulation result shows that the temperature field distribution likes an ellipse; secondly, comparing with the previous track, the latter one has larger heat affected region and larger inhomogeneous temperature distribution; the greatest temperature gradient takes place near the edges of deposited part where the sprayer scanning direction changes...|$|R

50|$|Key to {{this process}} are the raw {{materials}} and specialized <b>molding</b> <b>equipment.</b> Dimer acid based polyamide materials, better known as hot-melts, are used as molding compounds. They are thermoplastics i.e. the material, when heated, becomes less viscous {{and is able to}} re-shaped, then hardens to keep the desired form upon cooling down. These polyamide materials differ from other thermoplastics in two main areas:One: Viscosity: At processing temperature (410F/210C) the viscosity is very low, typically around 3,000 centipoise (similar to pancake syrup). Low viscosity materials require low injection pressure in order to inject into a cavity. In fact it is normal to use a simple gear pump to inject the polyamide material. Low injection pressure is paramount, when over-molding relatively fragile electronic component.Two: Adhesion: Polyamide materials are basically high performance hot-melt adhesives. The adhesive properties of polyamide is what seals a chosen substrate. The type of adhesion is purely mechanical i.e. no chemical reaction takes place.|$|E

40|$|QPA-CLIPS is an {{extension}} of CLIPS oriented towards process control applications. Its constructs define a dependency network of process actions driven by sensor information. The language consists of three basic constructs: TASK, SENSOR, and FILTER. TASK's define the dependency network describing alternative state transitions for a process.

Deftemplate's define these constructs and their run-time environment is an interpreter knowledge base, performing pattern matching on sensor information and so activating TASK's in the dependency network.
