5|$|Gyromitra caroliniana, known {{commonly}} as the Carolina false <b>morel</b> or big red, is an ascomycete fungus of {{the genus}} Gyromitra, within the Pezizales group of fungi. It is found in hardwood forests of the southeastern United States, where it fruits in early spring soon after snowmelt. Although it is collected and eaten by some, there is some suggestion it may contain the toxic compound gyromitrin like its poisonous relative, the false <b>morel</b> G.esculenta, {{and for this reason}} it is usually not recommended for consumption.|$|E
5|$|Gyromitra esculenta {{resembles the}} various species of true <b>morel,</b> {{although}} {{the latter are}} more symmetric and look more like pitted gray, tan, or brown sponges. Its cap is generally darker and larger.|$|E
5000|$|True <b>morels</b> are {{distinguished}} from false <b>morels</b> (Gyromitra spp. and Verpa spp.). False <b>morels</b> have caps attached {{at the top}} of the stalk, while true <b>morels</b> have a honeycombed cap and a single, continuous hollow chamber within.|$|R
5000|$|The key {{morphological}} features distinguishing false <b>morels</b> from true <b>morels</b> are as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|Since the cap is free in V. conica, it {{is easily}} {{distinguishable}} from true <b>morels.</b> True <b>morels</b> attach {{at the base}} of the cap. V. conica mushrooms attach at the top of the cap--so they are even distinguishable from half-free <b>morels.</b> This mushroom also tends to be filled with a cotton material, whereas <b>morels</b> are hollow all of the way through.|$|R
5|$|Morchella populiphila is a {{distinct}} <b>morel</b> because of its cap attachment and its habitat, and {{it is unlikely to}} be mistaken for other species. Verpa bohemica is somewhat similar in appearance, but its cap hangs free from attachment to the stipe. The other North American half-free <b>morel,</b> Morchella punctipes, is very similar in appearance to M.populiphila, and they cannot be reliably distinguished on morphology alone. The distribution of M.punctipes extends from the Great Plains eastward. The widespread European species Morchella semilibera is morphologically indistinguishable from M.populiphila, in both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Morchella snyderi was {{described}} as new to science in 2012, along with 13 other morels from the United States and Canada. The study, {{published in the journal}} Mycologia, resulted from the <b>Morel</b> Data Collection Project, which aimed to help clarify the taxonomy, biology, and distribution of <b>morel</b> species in North America. The specific epithet honors Leon C. Snyder, who described similar morels in Washington state in the 1930s. According to Michael Kuo, who coauthored the species description, the <b>morel</b> should have been named Morchella crassistipa, as it was previously described by Snyder in 1938, from collections made in Washington. However, molecular analysis determined that Snyder's type collection contained two distinct species, rendering the validity of the taxon dubious. M.snyderi was also previously identified as phylogenetic species Mel-12 (i.e., defined by DNA sequence) in a 2011 study.|$|E
5|$|Officially {{described}} in 2012, Morchella importuna {{was one of}} 14 new North American species that resulted from the <b>Morel</b> Data Collection Project.|$|E
5000|$|Based on {{studies of}} DNA, M. tomentosa {{is clearly a}} {{distinct}} species apart from the yellow <b>morels</b> (M. esculenta & ssp.) and black <b>morels</b> (M. elata & ssp.). [...] Mushroom collectors also use the common name [...] "gray morel" [...] for M. esculenta-type <b>morels</b> in eastern North America.|$|R
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Morchella elata group of black <b>morels,</b> M.importuna is sought after as a choice edible mushroom. Raw <b>morels</b> are {{poisonous}} and should always be cooked.|$|R
50|$|The supreme flavour of <b>morels</b> is {{not just}} {{appreciated}} by humans; in Yellowstone National Park, black <b>morels</b> are also known to be consumed by grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis).|$|R
5|$|The rare Pacific Northwest <b>morel</b> Morchella hotsonii, {{known only}} from its type collection, is quite similar in {{appearance}} to M.importuna. The former species is distinguished by its finely velvety surface.|$|E
5|$|Argentines Sebastián Battaglia, Neri Cardozo, Rodrigo Palacio, and Jesús Dátolo and Paraguayan Claudio <b>Morel</b> Rodríguez are {{the only}} players to have won three Recopa Sudamericana winners' medals. The overall top goalscorer in Recopa Sudamericana history is Rodrigo Palacio, scorer of five goals. Leandro Damião is second with 3 goals. Rodrigo Palacio and Leandro Damião hold {{the record for the}} most goals scored in a single Recopa Sudamericana. Each of their three goals was scored in the 2006 and 2010 finals, respectively. Claudio <b>Morel</b> Rodríguez is the player with most {{appearances}} in the competition, 5 editions (winning three finals), all of them in Boca Juniors with the exception of 2003 (played for San Lorenzo). Paraguayan Julio César Cáceres, Argentine Jesús Dátolo and Brazilian André {{are the only}} players that won the Recopa Sudamericana with two different teams. Cáceres won in 2003 with Olimpia and 2008 with Boca Juniors, Dátolo won in 2006 and 2008 with Boca and in 2014 with Atlético Mineiro, and André won in 2012 with Santos and 2014 with Atlético Mineiro.|$|E

The album included Morel's new composition Me duele España, written for and dedicated to Laucke. The world premiere of the 21-minute piece took place at Place des Arts in Montreal, {{under the auspices of}} the Société de musique contemporaine du Québec.|$|E

50|$|Verpa is a genus of ascomycete fungi {{related to}} the <b>morels.</b> Resembling the latter genus, they are called false or early <b>morels.</b> There are five species in the {{widespread}} genus.|$|R
5000|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{has shown that}} the half-free <b>morels,</b> which appear nearly identical on a macroscopic scale, are a cryptic species complex, consisting of at least three geographically isolated species. [...] Because de Candolle originally described the species based on specimens from Europe, the scientific name M. semilibera should be restricted to the European species. [...] In 2012, Morchella populiphila was described from western North America, while Peck's 1903 species name Morchella punctipes was reaffirmed for eastern North American half-free <b>morels.</b> [...] M. semilibera and the other half-free <b>morels</b> are closely related to the black <b>morels</b> (M. elata and others).|$|R
5|$|Laucke has had 25 original, Canadian atonal works {{written for}} him, {{among them the}} Flamenco Concierto for guitar and full symphonic {{orchestra}} by , Me duele España by François <b>Morel,</b> Exploration by Jean Papineau-Couture and Pour guitare, Claude Vivier's only work for the guitar. Laucke performed all 25 works in major halls, on CBC radio and on his record albums; {{all of them were}} commissioned by, and dedicated to, Laucke.|$|E
5|$|Morchella rufobrunnea, {{commonly}} known as the blushing <b>morel,</b> is a species of ascomycete fungus in the family Morchellaceae. A choice edible species, the fungus was originally described as new to science in 1998 by mycologists Gastón Guzmán and Fidel Tapia from collections made in Veracruz, Mexico. Its distribution was later revealed to be far more widespread after several DNA studies suggested that it is common in the West Coast of the United States, Israel, Australia, and Cyprus.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{players of}} this period {{included}} Albert <b>Morel</b> and Fred Chittick in goal, leaders of the league several times in goaltending, and future Hall of Famers Harvey Pulford, Alf Smith, Harry Westwick and brothers Bruce Stuart and Hod Stuart. It was during this period that the nickname Senators was first used; however, from 1903 to 1906, the team is {{better known as the}} Silver Seven.|$|E
5|$|The more distantly related ascomycete {{mushrooms}} of {{the genus}} Verpa, such as V. bohemica and V. conica, are also known as false <b>morels,</b> early <b>morels</b> or thimble morels; like the Gyromitra, they are eaten by some and considered poisonous by others.|$|R
5000|$|Morchella species contain {{small amounts}} of {{hydrazine}} toxins that are destroyed through cooking; because of this, <b>morels</b> should never be eaten raw. It {{has been reported that}} even cooked <b>morels</b> can sometimes cause symptoms of upset stomach when consumed with alcohol.|$|R

5|$|Wizard was a {{chestnut}} colt foaled in 1806 {{and bred}} by Mr. Goodison. He was sired by Sorcerer, a successful racehorse and three-time Champion sire in Britain. Amongst Sorcerer's other progeny were 2000 Guineas and Derby winner Smolensko, St. Leger winner Soothsayer and the Oaks winners <b>Morel,</b> Maid of Orleans and Sorcery. Wizard's dam was {{a daughter of}} Precipitate. Wizard was the second of her ten foals. He was trained by Tom Perren.|$|E
5|$|Like many <b>morel</b> species, the {{ecological}} mode of Morchella populiphila {{is not known}} with certainty, but it is suspected of being both saprobic (obtaining its nourishment from nonliving or decaying organic matter) and mycorrhizal (symbiotic with trees) at different stages in its life cycle. Fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or in groups. It is found in Oregon to Nevada and northern California, where it grows on dried-out riverbeds. Fruiting, which occurs in the spring, tends to occur shortly after the emergence of Verpa mushrooms, and before the appearance of other morels.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of {{nucleic acid sequences}} from the internal transcribed spacer and elongation factor EF-1α regions suggests that the genus Morchella {{can be divided into}} three lineages. M.rufobrunnea belongs to a lineage that is basal to the esculenta clade ("yellow morels"), and the elata clade ("black morels"). This phylogenetic placement implies that it has existed in its current form since the Cretaceous era (roughly 145 to 66 million years ago), and all known <b>morel</b> species evolved from a similar ancestor. M.rufobrunnea is genetically closer to the yellow morels than the black morels. M.anatolica, described from Turkey in 2012, is a closely related sister species.|$|E
50|$|Morchella, {{the true}} <b>morels,</b> is a genus of edible sac fungi {{closely related to}} anatomically simpler cup fungi in the order Pezizales (division Ascomycota). These {{distinctive}} fungi have a honeycomb appearance, due to the network of ridges with pits composing their cap. <b>Morels</b> are prized by gourmet cooks, particularly in French cuisine. Due to difficulties in cultivation, commercial harvesting of wild <b>morels</b> has become a multimillion-dollar industry in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, in particular North America, Turkey, China, the Himalayas, India, and Pakistan, where these highly prized fungi are found in abundance.|$|R
50|$|The {{ecology of}} Morchella species {{is not well}} understood. Many species appear to form {{symbiotic}} or endophytic relationships with trees, while others appear to act as saprotrophs. Yellow <b>morels</b> (Morchella esculenta and related species) are more commonly found under deciduous trees rather than conifers, while black <b>morels</b> (Morchella elata and related species) are mostly found in coniferous forests, disturbed ground and recently burned areas. Morchella galilaea, and occasionally Morchella rufobrunnea, appear to fruit in the autumn or winter months rather than spring, which is the typical fruiting season for <b>morels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tree species {{associated}} with Morchela vary greatly {{depending on the}} individual species, continent, or region. Trees commonly {{associated with}} <b>morels</b> in Europe and across the Mediterranean include Abies (fir), Pinus (pine), Populus (poplar), Ulmus (elm), Quercus (oak), Arbutus (strawberry trees), Castanea (chestnut), Alnus (alder), Olea (olive trees), Malus (apple trees) and Fraxinus (ash). In western North America <b>morels</b> are often found in coniferous forests, including species of Pinus (pine), Abies (fir), Larix (larch), and Pseudotsuga (Douglas-fir), {{as well as in}} Populus (cottonwood) riparian forests. Deciduous trees commonly associated with <b>morels</b> in the northern hemisphere include Fraxinus (ash), Platanus (sycamore), Liriodendron (tulip tree), dead and dying elms, cottonwoods and old apple trees (remnants of orchards). Due to their springtime phenology (March-May), <b>morels</b> are hardly ever found in the vicinity of common poisonous mushrooms such as the death cap (Amanita phalloides), the sulphur tuft (Hypholoma fasciculare), or the fly agaric (Amanita muscaria). They can, however, occur alongside false <b>morels</b> (Gyromitra and Verpa species) and elfin saddles (Helvella species), which also appear in spring.|$|R
5|$|Morchella rufobrunnea is the <b>morel</b> that is {{cultivated}} commercially per US patents 4594809 and 4757640. This {{process was}} developed in 1982 by Ronald Ower with {{what he thought was}} Morchella esculenta; M.rufobrunnea had not yet been described. The cultivation protocol consists of preparing a spawn culture that is mixed with nutrient-poor soil. This mixture is laid on nutrient-rich soil and kept sufficiently moist until fruiting. In the nutrient-poor substrate, the fungus forms sclerotia—hardened masses of mycelia that serve as food reserves. Under appropriate environmental conditions, these sclerotia grow into morels.|$|E
5|$|Morchella sextelata is morphologically {{indistinguishable from}} several other <b>morel</b> {{species in the}} M.elata clade, {{including}} M.septimelata, M.brunnea, M.angusticeps, and M.septentrionalis. M.septimelata can be distinguished from these latter three lookalikes by habitat or distribution: M.brunnea is found in non-burned forests of western North America; M.angusticeps is found east of the Rocky Mountains; and M.septentrionalis is restricted to a northern distribution (about 44°N northward) in eastern North America. M.septimelata, however, also grows in burn sites and so is both morphologically and ecologically indistinguishable from M.sextelata. Although there are subtle differences {{in the structure of}} the sterile ridges between the species, the authors were not confident that enough specimens had been examined to establish that these differences were consistent.|$|E
5|$|Geopyxis carbonaria is {{widespread}} on burned soil or charcoal {{in the spring}} and throughout the growing season. It {{is one of the most}} common pioneer species found on burned ground. The charred litter on the forest floor increases the underlying soil pH as well as the availability of minerals. Fruitbodies are produced from 16 to 139 weeks after a forest fire in areas with coniferous trees. Most fruitbodies are produced in the first year after a burn. The fungus prefers fruiting in microhabitats with thin postfire duff near standing burned tree trunks. Geopyxis carbonaria fruitbodies are often found in the same post-fire stands as morels, although the former is usually more abundant. Because the pixie cup fruits earlier than morels, it may serve as an indicator of imminent <b>morel</b> fruiting. Other cup fungi often found fruiting in the same area as G.carbonaria include those from the genera Aleuria, Anthracobia, Peziza, and Tarzetta.|$|E
