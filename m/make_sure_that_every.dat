Each session begins by betting 1 unit, and ends by winning 1 unit of profit. If the gambler loses, the session continues and the bet is repeated.

This increase is not performed if the current bet warrants achieving at least 1 unit of profit in total, in case the next game is won.

[...] This means that residents pay only what they can afford, and the Commonwealth government pays what a resident cannot.

That review concluded that approximately 80% of care for older Australians is informal care provided by family, friends and neighbours. Around a million people received government-subsidised aged care services, most of these receiving low-level community care support, with 160 000 people in permanent residential care. Expenditure on aged care by all governments in 2009-10 was approximately $11 billion.|$|E

In this paper we survey the development of models for network survivability used in practice in the last ten years. We show how algorithms integrating polyhedral combinatorics, linear programming, and various heuristic ideas can help solve real-world network dimensioning instances to optimality or within reasonable quality guarantees in acceptable running times. The most general problem type we address is the following. Let a communication demand between each pair of nodes of a telecommunication network be given. We consider the problem of choosing, among a discrete set of possible capacities, which capacity to install on each of the possible edges of the network in order to (i) satisfy all demands, (ii) minimize the building cost of the network. In addition to determining the network topology and the edge capacities we have to provide, for each demand, a routing such that (iii) no path can carry more than a given percentage of the demand, (iv) no path in the routing exceeds a given length. We also have to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> (v) for <b>every</b> single node or edge failure, a certain percentage of the demand is reroutable. Moreover, for all failure situations feasible routings must be computed. The model described above has been developed in cooperation with a German mobile phone provider.

She initially found it strange to voice Lightning, as {{she was used to}} gentler roles such as Aerith Gainsborough, a central character in Final Fantasy VII and its companion media. Commenting on the difficulty of balancing Lightning's depiction as a woman and a professionally trained warrior, Kitase noted that Sakamoto's acting helped to bring out Lightning's femininity. Hillis was given the role of Lightning after speaking a few of the character's lines during audition, and was then given a book about the Final Fantasy XIII universe, which she found a little [...] "overwhelming" [...] when she read it. One of the challenges Hillis faced was recapturing the emotion and energy of Sakamoto's Japanese performance in the character's English rendition.

40|$|Introduction: Schools {{throughout}} Scotland {{provide a}} critically important resource to support local community cultural and sporting activities of every level and type. The strategic importance of school facilities has been fully {{recognised in the}} national strategy for sport Reaching Higher and by the Scottish Arts Council in their developing facilities strategy. With the current record levels of government and local authority investment in the school estate, {{it is all the}} more important to consider how best to optimise the opportunities presented by these developments and to ensure that all schools make the most effective contribution to cultural and sporting life throughout Scotland. In 1999 the Programme for Government committed to building or significantly renovating 100 schools by 2003. In 2002 a further commitment was made to complete an additional 200 new or substantially refurbished schools by 2006, and in 2003 this was extended to enable the renewal of 300 schools by 2009 (including the 200 schools identified in 2002). Audit Scotland considered that, depending on how 'significantly renovate' and 'substantially refurbished' are defined, the targets for 2003 and 2006 had been achieved and the 2009 target would be achieved. Local councils and the (then) Scottish Executive spent or committed some £ 3. 9 bn on capital improvements to school buildings during the seven years 2000 / 01 - 06 / 07, which was likely to reach more than £ 5. 2 bn by April 2008. Most of that additional investment was due to PFI contracts, estimated at £ 896 m in 2007 / 08. This level of investment has been accompanied by increased emphasis on maximising the use of the school estate. For example, The 21 st century school states that, in addition to meeting the needs of the individual child, a key objective of new investments and approaches was to put the school {{at the heart of the}} community and deliver better services. As part of the strategy for integrated community schools, there has been a requirement to engage with the communities that the schools serve, in part by offering services and access to services and facilities. The Scottish Executive partnership agreement stated that: - We will develop the largest ever school building programme in Scotland‘s history, renewing 200 more schools by 2006, rising to 300 by 2009. These schools should be available to the whole community and include high quality facilities for drama, music, sport, IT and, in secondary schools, science laboratories. - New schools should demonstrate commitment to the highest design and environmental standards. - We will <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> by 2007 <b>every</b> school is an integrated community school. In 2006, the Scottish Executive stated that the Integrated Community School initiative had developed and been overtaken by the wider integration agenda: - It no longer makes sense to think of schools separately from other agencies. We would now say that: By 2007 every school in Scotland will participate in delivering 'Integrated Children‘s Services'...|$|R
