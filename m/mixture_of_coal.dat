40|$|An {{investigation}} into {{different aspects of}} importance {{in the understanding of}} explosibility <b>of</b> hybrid <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> dus 4 air and gases potentially found within mine workings through a comprehensive laboratory program of explosibility tests was conducted. Plotting of test results revealed that conditions of potential explosibility could be described using two dimensional flammability limit surfaces for coal dust/oxygen; methane/oxygen; and coal dust/methane mixtures. From these plots, the three dimensional flammability envelopes defining the explosibility <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> dust/methane/oxygen <b>mixtures</b> can be defined and illustrated for a coal sample. The surfaces of the three dimensional envelope describe limits which separate inert <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> dust and methane at varying oxygen levels from those concentrations which are ignitable under defined conditions. It is considered appropriate to generalise that the geometric shapes of these limit regions are applicable to all type classifications <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> dust. There are practical applications of these results to the underground environment. The action of free radical initiators in the propagation of a methane gas explosion was examined for its applicability to the flammability <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> dust/gas/air <b>mixtures.</b> The oxides <b>of</b> nitrogen or NOx radicals have influence upon the lean limits of flammability <b>of</b> hybrid <b>mixtures</b> and this is illustrated by use of three dimensional coordinate geometry. Gases can be introduced to the underground environment through the exhaust gases of diesel equipment. It is concluded that radical species can substantially increase the flammability of gas and dust flames and as a consequence raise risk of mine atmosphere explosibility...|$|R

40|$|Complex {{interactions}} among {{components in the}} heterogeneous grinding have an influence on breakage and energy consumption characteristics <b>of</b> components in <b>mixtures</b> if compared with the single breakage. In this paper, a modified Hardgrove mill, {{with the addition of}} a power meter, is used to simulate the grinding process of vertical spindle pulverizer. Binary-component <b>mixtures</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> and pyrite, or coal and calcite, in the size of − 2. 8 + 2 mm, are prepared to study the heterogeneous breakage. For the <b>mixture</b> A <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> and pyrite, the fineness of pyrite progeny is higher than that from single-breakage. Instead, the coal in mixture A shows the opposite trend. Because of the relatively less difference in hardness between coal and calcite, size distributions of components are environment-independent.
