40|$|This paper, {{based on}} a real world case study (Limmat aquifer, Switzerland), compares inverse {{groundwater}} flow models calibrated with specified numbers of <b>monitoring</b> head <b>locations.</b> These models are updated in real time with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and the prediction improvement is assessed {{in relation to the}} amount of <b>monitoring</b> <b>locations</b> used for calibration and updating. The prediction errors of the models calibrated in transient state are smaller if the amount of <b>monitoring</b> <b>locations</b> used for the calibration is larger. For highly dynamic groundwater flow systems a transient calibration is recommended as a model calibrated in steady state can lead to worse results than a noncalibrated model with a well-chosen uniform conductivity. The model predictions can be improved further with the assimilation of new measurement data from on-line sensors with the EnKF. Within all the studied models the reduction of 1 -day hydraulic head prediction error (in terms of mean absolute error [MAE]) with EnKF lies between 31 % (assimilation of head data from 5 locations) and 72 % (assimilation of head data from 85 locations). The largest prediction improvements are expected for models that were calibrated with only a limited amount of historical information. It is worthwhile to update the model even with few <b>monitoring</b> <b>locations</b> as it seems that the error reduction with EnKF decreases exponentially with the amount of <b>monitoring</b> <b>locations</b> used. These results prove the feasibility of data assimilation with EnKF also for a real world case and show that improved predictions of groundwater levels can be obtained...|$|R

40|$|Management {{strategies}} for the optimal and sustainable use of groundwater resources are developed based on prescriptive models that use mathematical tools for simulation and optimization together with field data. Because of the uncertainty inherent in the groundwater systems, {{it is essential to}} verify the compliance of the implemented strategies to those prescribed by using proper monitoring techniques during and after the implementation stages of the groundwater management project. In this work, an adaptive management approach for optimal management and monitoring of coastal aquifers is proposed. A simulation-optimization approach is used to derive optimal pumping strategy for the management of saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers. Then, an optimal monitoring network is designed to evaluate the compliance of the aquifer responses in the field with those predicted by the simulation-optimization model. The designed network can be used to monitor the compliance in the field in terms of the salinity concentration levels, which result from the implementation of the optimal pumping strategy. Uncertainty in the values of groundwater parameters and the uncertainty resulting from the deviation of the pumping strategies from the prescribed optimum values are characterized by considering different realizations of these values in the three-dimensional density dependent flow and transport simulation model. A new objective for monitoring is considered in this study. The objective function consists of maximizing the coefficient of variation of the salinity concentration at the <b>monitored</b> <b>locations</b> and minimizing the correlation coefficient between the concentrations at the <b>monitored</b> <b>locations.</b> Using this objective, the <b>monitoring</b> <b>locations</b> are chosen in regions where the uncertainty in the concentration values is highest, and those locations where the correlation between the concentrations of the <b>monitored</b> <b>locations</b> is lowest, so that the redundancy in monitoring data is the least. The concentration data collected at the optimal compliance <b>monitoring</b> <b>locations</b> can be used as feedback information to improve the initially developed optimal coastal aquifer management strategies.

40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} {{the concepts of}} monitoring paths (MPs) and monitoring cycles (MCs) for unique localization of shared risk linked group (SRLG) failures in all-optical networks. An SRLG failure causes multiple links to break simultaneously due {{to the failure of}} a common resource. MCs (MPs) start and end at the same (distinct) monitoring location(s). They are constructed such that any SRLG failure results in the failure of a unique combination of paths and cycles. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the set of MCs and MPs needed for localizing any single SRLG failure in an arbitrary graph. When a single <b>monitoring</b> <b>location</b> is employed, we show that a network must be (k + 2) -edge connected for localizing all SRLG failures, each involving up to k links. For networks that are less than (k+ 2) edge connected, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the placement of monitoring locations for unique localization of any single SRLG failure of up to k links. We use these conditions to develop an algorithm for determining monitoring locations. We show a graph transformation technique that converts the problem of identifying MCs and MPs with multiple monitoring locations to a problem of identifying MCs with a single <b>monitoring</b> <b>location.</b> We provide an integer linear program and a heuristic to identify MCs for networks with one <b>monitoring</b> <b>location.</b> We then consider the monitoring problem for networks with no dedicated bandwidth for monitoring purposes. For such networks, we use passive probing of lightpaths by employing optical splitters at various intermediate nodes. Through an integer linear programming formulation, we identify the minimum number of optical splitters that are required to monitor all SRLG failures in the network.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} monitoring tours (m-tours) to uniquely localize all possible failures up to k links in all-optical networks. We establish paths and cycles that can traverse the same link at most twice (forward and backward) and call them m-tours. An m-tour is different from other existing schemes such as m-cycle and m-trail, which traverse a link at most once. Closed (open) m-tours start and terminate at the same (distinct) <b>monitor</b> <b>location(s).</b> Each tour is constructed such that any shared risk linked group (SRLG) failure results in {{the failure of a}} unique combination of closed and open m-tours. We prove that k-edge connectivity is a sufficient condition to localize all SRLG failures with up to k-link failures when only one monitoring station is employed. We introduce an integer linear program (ILP) and a greedy scheme to find the <b>monitoring</b> <b>locations</b> to uniquely localize any SRLG failures with up to k links. We provide a heuristic scheme to compute m-tours for a given network. We demonstrate the validity of the proposed monitoring method through simulations.

30|$|Using {{the same}} set of {{waveform}} data, the Thevenin impedance of the transmission network upstream from the <b>monitoring</b> <b>location</b> can be estimated. The Thevenin impedance, {{often referred to as the}} short-circuit impedance, plays an important role when calculating the currents during a balanced or an unbalanced fault [12]. System operators obtain the Thevenin impedance by performing a short-circuit analysis on the circuit model. However, to avoid any erroneous fault current calculations due to an inaccurate circuit model, it is a good practice to validate the short-circuit impedance from the circuit model with that calculated from the fault data. The Thevenin impedance is also required by the Eriksson, Novosel et al., and other fault-locating algorithms to track down the location of a fault [8, 13, 14]. Furthermore, the Thevenin impedance calculated at regular intervals during a long duration fault can provide insight into the state of the transmission network upstream from the fault. Authors in [15] have attempted to estimate the Thevenin impedance but have not provided the equations for the same. Authors in [15, 16] have also highlighted the importance and uses of estimating the Thevenin impedance. Hence, it is essential to estimate the Thevenin impedance of the transmission network upstream from the <b>monitoring</b> <b>location</b> using any available fault data.|$|E

40|$|With the {{increasing}} attention to site-specific or variable rate irrigation management, {{it is helpful}} to reconsider the quantity and placement of soil water <b>monitoring</b> <b>locations</b> in this context. Volumetric soil water content (θv) was monitored using a neutron probe (NP) at 72 locations in a center pivot irrigated field in eastern Nebraska. Variance reduction and temporal stability analyses were performed on θv from shallow (∼top 46 cm) and full profile (∼ 122 cm) readings for four monitoring cycles in the 2015 growing season and 2016 preseason. Eleven additional cycles were included for a subset of the data for the temporal stability analysis. The spatial correlation scale for θv was found to be less than the closest spacing of <b>monitoring</b> <b>locations</b> in the study (i. e. 3 ̆c 37 m). For this field site, approximately three neutron probe <b>monitoring</b> <b>locations</b> were required to determine mean soil water depletion (± 2 cm) for the field or for a management zone. Little economy would be gained in variance reduction for areal mean θv from using a stratified network for management areas of reasonable size in a center pivot irrigated field. Temporally stable <b>monitoring</b> <b>locations</b> were identified. However, relatively low-cost spatial predictor variables, including elevation, deviation from mean elevation, apparent electrical conductivity, and mean relative difference of interpolated cosmic ray neutron probe surveys, were not consistent predictors of NP mean relative difference. The small range of variability of θv within the study field is thought to be a contributing factor. It is possible that for fields with similar variability, or for site-specific irrigation where zones have been selected to reduce within-zone variance, that sensor quantity is more important than sensor placement in quantifying the areal mean θv for irrigation management...|$|R
