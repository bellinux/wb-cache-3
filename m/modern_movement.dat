5|$|Being one of {{the tallest}} {{buildings}} in Singapore in the early 20th century, the Great Southern Hotel was an important landmark of Chinatown. Designed by Swan and Maclaren, the architectural style of the Nam Tin Building {{was that of the}} <b>Modern</b> <b>Movement.</b> The building was designed to be strictly functional. The grey-coloured façade of the Great Southern Hotel seemed to consist only of the bare essentials, with ordinary designs like strong horizontal lines with angular arches and simple cornices. The building was fitted with steel frame windows, with metal railings and grills, which were considered fashionable in the 1930s. The loggia on the uppermost floor was a little lighter in colour with the use of cast iron balustrades and brackets, and there was extensive use of green glass. The building was {{one of the}} first in Singapore to be built as an integral structure of reinforced concrete slab and beam with infill brick wall.|$|E

25|$|The {{functional}} and formalized shapes and {{spaces of the}} modernist movement are replaced by unapologetically diverse aesthetics: styles collide, form is adopted for its own sake, and new ways of viewing familiar styles and space abound. Perhaps most obviously, architects rediscovered the expressive and symbolic value of architectural elements and forms that had evolved through centuries of buildingoften maintaining meaning in literature, poetry and artbut which had been abandoned by the <b>modern</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E

25|$|A modern {{resurgence}} of the office began among Protestants in Germany in the 1840s and spread through Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Britain and the United States. Lutherans were especially active. The <b>modern</b> <b>movement</b> reached a peak about 1910, then slowly declined as secularization undercut religiosity in Europe and the professionalization of nursing and social work offered better career opportunities for young women. A small movement still exists and its legacy is seen in numerous hospitals.|$|E
25|$|The 1920s and 1930s saw {{the advent}} of Modernism in the Dutch East Indies. Typical {{features}} included flat roofs and cubic forms, with minimal consideration of the tropics. Art Deco ornamentation was sometimes incorporated into the design. Albert Frederik Aalbers {{was one of the}} representatives of the <b>Modern</b> <b>movement</b> in Indonesia before the Second World War. His work is characterized by its clean-cut, functionalist elevations, which often feature curved lines, and the absence of external ornamentation and other purely decorative devices.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of the 20th century is {{regarded}} by many as the golden age of Romanian culture and it is the period when it reached its main level of international affirmation and a strong connection to the European cultural trends. The most important artist who had a great influence on the world culture was the sculptor Constantin Brâncuși (1876–1957), a central figure of the <b>modern</b> <b>movement</b> and a pioneer of abstraction, an innovator of world sculpture by immersion in the primordial sources of folk creation.|$|E
50|$|In English, the Italian {{term has}} been used {{since at least the}} late seventeenth century. The term is less {{frequently}} used of art after the late nineteenth century, although the Expressionist and other <b>modern</b> <b>movements</b> make great use of the effect.|$|R
50|$|Despite this he {{was known}} {{throughout}} the Russian art world to be a liberal thinker whose paintings showed the influences of Impressionism and other <b>modern</b> <b>movements.</b> Under Joseph Stalin these tendencies placed him in aesthetic opposition to his nemesis (and ironic namesake) Aleksandr Gerasimov.|$|R
50|$|Reflecting that zeal, the <b>modern</b> missionary <b>movement</b> {{began in}} this country through a group of Andover {{students}} known as the Brethren.

25|$|On 9 August 2009, Adygea officially {{attempted}} to overrule the Russian immigration quota for Circassians by putting forth its own de facto quota, which was drastically higher, allowing many more Circassians {{to return to}} their homeland. According to Western Circassophile John Colarusso, the movement to allow and encourage Circassian return to their homeland (hence, changing the demographics {{in a way that is}} advantageous for the Circassians and disadvantageous for the Russians) is one of the major objectives and rallying points of the <b>modern</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 1819 Hamburg {{controversy}} signified a new {{pattern of}} thought {{on the part}} of the conservatives, one that the rabbi of Pressburg already embraced. Their polemics were not a mere continuation of legalistic argumentation, but a self-conscious, concerted backlash intended to safeguard the very authority of tradition. As such, most historians regard it to be the beginning of Orthodox Judaism as a <b>modern</b> <b>movement,</b> a defined, beleaguered perception which could not merely perpetuate old modes of thought. It had to defend itself actively against encroaching deviation in a world where the rabbis lacked all their old legal means of enforcement.|$|E
25|$|The <b>modern</b> <b>movement</b> for the canonization of Juan Diego (to be {{distinguished}} from the process for gaining official approval for the Guadalupe cult, which had begun in 1663 and was realized in 1754) {{can be said to}} have arisen in earnest in 1974 during celebrations marking the five hundredth anniversary of the traditional date of his birth, {{but it was not until}} January 1984 that the then Archbishop of Mexico, Cardinal Ernesto Corripio Ahumada, named a Postulator to supervise and coordinate the inquiry, and initiated the formal process for canonization. The procedure for this first, or diocesan, stage of the canonization process had recently been reformed and simplified by order of Pope John Paul II.|$|E

25|$|The Arts and Crafts Movement {{marked a}} golden age of Birmingham architecture, placing the city at the {{forefront}} of English architecture at a time when English architecture was leading the world. Its influence was international: Lethaby was the most important architectural theorist of the whole movement, and built over half of his work in Birmingham or for Birmingham clients, while the buildings of Birmingham architects such as William Bidlake and William Alexander Harvey were to feature prominently in Herman Muthesius's 1905 book The English House, which was to be revolutionary in its introduction of the Arts and Crafts philosophy into Germany, and a pivotal influence on the later birth of the <b>modern</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{roots of}} the {{conflict}} {{can be traced to}} the late 19th century, with the rise of national movements, including Zionism and Arab nationalism. Though the Jewish aspiration to return to Zion had been part of Jewish religious thought for more than a millennium, the Jewish population of Europe and to some degree Middle East began to more actively discuss immigration back to the Land of Israel, and the re-establishment of the Jewish Nation, only during 1859 to the 1880s, largely as a solution to the widespread persecution of Jews, and antisemitism in Russia and Europe. As a result, the Zionist movement, the <b>modern</b> <b>movement</b> for the creation of a homeland for the Jewish people, was established as a political movement in 1897.|$|E
25|$|Rav Kook {{tried to}} build and {{maintain}} channels of communication and political alliances between the various Jewish sectors, including the secular Jewish Zionist leadership, the Religious Zionists, and more traditional non-Zionist Orthodox Jews. He believed that the <b>modern</b> <b>movement</b> to re-establish a Jewish state {{in the land of}} Israel had profound theological significance and that the Zionists were agents in a heavenly plan to bring about the messianic era. Per this ideology, the youthful, secular and even anti-religious Labor Zionist pioneers, halutzim, were a part of a grand Divine process whereby the land and people of Israel were finally being redeemed from the 2,000-year exile (galut) by all manner of Jews who sacrificed themselves for the cause of building up the physical land, as laying the groundwork for the ultimate spiritual messianic redemption of world Jewry.|$|E
