5|$|A {{few months}} ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. <b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but {{the facts and the}} evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E
5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E

25|$|Disney {{monitored}} and controlled the CPRR's track from a special barn. The barn's design {{was based on}} a set piece for the 1949 Disney film So Dear to <b>My</b> <b>Heart,</b> <b>and</b> it brought back Disney's childhood memories of a similar barn located on his family farm in Marceline, Missouri. The barn had a centralized traffic control board, which had several lights designed to indicate the presence of trains along the railroad's route. The CPRR's switches could also be electrically controlled from this board. The barn also served as the storage facility for the CPRR's caboose.|$|E
25|$|A peace {{made with}} foreigners {{at the expense}} of the princes of the blood; with the House of Lorraine {{at the expense of}} the House of France; with rebels at the expense of obedient subjects; with {{agitators}} at the expense of those who have brought peace by every means within their power.... I intend to oppose it with all <b>my</b> <b>heart,</b> <b>and</b> to this end to rally around me... all true Frenchmen without regard to religion, since this time it is a question of the defence of the state against the usurpation of foreigners.|$|E
25|$|I saw in {{his hand}} a long spear of gold, and at the point {{there seemed to be}} a little fire. He {{appeared}} to me to be thrusting it at times into <b>my</b> <b>heart,</b> <b>and</b> to pierce my very entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out also, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God. The pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet so surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I could not wish to be rid of it...|$|E

After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E

500|$|That {{is one of}} {{my biggest}} records ever, hype-wise, the music itself, I love it to the core. I don’t do songs {{thinking}} this has to be a hit.

New Guy is like a heart fulfilling type of record and to me, I think it actually hit the major impact that I wanted it to hit and people are loving it [...] My fans love it.|$|E

500|$|The final movement, {{possibly}} [...] "Führ auch mein Herz und Sinn" [...] (Also lead <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> mind), is a four-part chorale setting, marked [...] "Chorale in semplice stylo"; however, {{only the}} continuo line is extant. While the libretto {{shows that a}} stanza from Heermann's [...] "Wo soll ich fliehen hin" [...] was to be used, sung to a melody by Christian Friedrich Witt, the Bach scholar Andreas Glöckner found that the continuo part matches the tune in the previous movement, which appeared in a hymnal published by Witt.|$|E
500|$|This meaning {{was also}} evident in the song's lyrics. [...] In the second line, Fanning states that [...] "I made a mistake that I'll never surpass", before {{explaining}} {{that it does not}} matter whose fault it is, in saying [...] "I know you needed someone to take the fall/I know you needed someone to blame it on". [...] In the second verse, Fanning again reiterates that he feels pain in the mistake that was made, when he says [...] "I found <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> it broke like glass/I made that mistake that I'll never surpass".|$|E
500|$|Stax Records {{president}} Jim Stewart had released Otis Redding's [...] "These Arms of Mine" [...] {{after hearing}} him sing it at an audition in 1962; {{and when it}} charted, he signed Redding to Stax. [...] Following the moderately successful Pain in <b>My</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>and</b> The Great Otis Redding Sings Soul Ballads, both of which performed well in the newly established Billboard R LP chart {{but not in the}} Billboard 200, preparations for the third studio album followed soon after. The album would be Redding's third studio album and second on Stax's sister label Volt.|$|E

500|$|The Nemesis of Faith {{also drew}} {{criticism}} on literary grounds as being melodramatic and sentimental. Froude himself {{wrote to his}} friend Charles Kingsley that [...] "I cut a hole in <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> wrote with the blood". Thomas Carlyle complained of the novel [...] "Froude ought to consume his own smoke and not trouble other people's nostrils." [...] Although recent critics {{tend to be more}} positive about the novel's depiction of Sutherland's speculative crisis, they have maintained the weakness of the ending, attributing it to Froude's inability {{to come to terms with}} his own doubts.|$|E
500|$|Of {{literary}} figures {{after the}} Lake Poets among those most {{closely associated with}} Keswick was the novelist Hugh Walpole. In 1924 he moved into Brackenburn, a house between Keswick and Grange {{at the opposite end}} of Derwentwater. Like the Lake Poets in the previous century, he wrote enthusiastically about the Lake District, and its scenery and atmosphere often found their way into his fiction. He wrote in 1939, [...] "That I love Cumberland with all <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> soul is another reason for my pleasure in writing these Herries books. That I wasn't born a Cumbrian isn't my fault: that Cumbrians, in spite of my 'foreignness', have been so kind to me, is my good fortune." ...|$|E
500|$|When, {{from the}} early 1960s, Takemitsu began to [...] "consciously apprehend" [...] the sounds of {{traditional}} Japanese music, he found that his creative process, [...] "the logic of my compositional thought was torn apart", and nevertheless, [...] "hogaku [...] seized <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> refuses to release it". In particular, Takemitsu perceived that, for example, {{the sound of a}} single stroke of the biwa or single pitch breathed through the shakuhachi, could [...] "so transport our reason because they are of extreme complexity... already complete in themselves". This fascination with the sounds produced in traditional Japanese music brought Takemitsu to his idea of ma (usually translated as the space between two objects), which ultimately informed his understanding of the intense quality of traditional Japanese music as a whole: ...|$|E
