25|$|The {{diagnosis}} or {{suspicion of}} LGS {{is often a}} question of probability rather than certainty. This is because the varied presentations of LGS share features with other disorders, many of which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to have overlapping characteristics.|$|E

25|$|Later Canaletto painted grand {{scenes of}} the canals of Venice and the Doge's Palace.
