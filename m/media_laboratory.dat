25|$|The {{advent of}} {{consumer}} digital cameras produced a new demand for HDR imaging {{to improve the}} light response of digital camera sensors, which had a much smaller dynamic range than film. Steve Mann developed and patented the global-HDR method for producing digital images having extended dynamic range at the MIT <b>Media</b> <b>Laboratory.</b> Mann's method involved a two-step procedure: (1) generate one floating point image array by global-only image operations (operations that affect all pixels identically, without regard to their local neighborhoods); and then (2) convert this image array, using local neighborhood processing (tone-remapping, etc.), into an HDR image. The image array generated by {{the first step of}} Mann's process is called a lightspace image, lightspace picture, or radiance map. Another benefit of global-HDR imaging is that it provides access to the intermediate light or radiance map, which has been used for computer vision, and other image processing operations.|$|E

Desoxycholate citrate agar (DCA) and Hektoen enteric (HE) agar are suitable alternatives to XLD agar as media of moderate to high selectivity...|$|R

A. Isolation Methods Before 1992, of the more than 150 serogroups of Vibrio cholerae that have been reported, only the O 1 serogroup was associated with epidemic and pandemic cholera. However in late 1992 and early 1993, large outbreaks of cholera due to a newly described serogroup, O 139, were reported in India and Bangladesh. This strain, like serogroup O 1 V. cholerae, produces cholera enterotoxin.
