40|$|AbstractIn hot rolling, {{the strips}} have been {{needed to be}} rolled harder and faster to obtain thinner and higher quality strips, such as high {{strength}} steel or dual phase type high strength steel and so on. As the strips move faster and are rolled harder, the larger impact force in the threading occurs and suddenly mill starts to vibrate with enormous amplitude. The larger impact force or mill vibration causes not only the reduction of life time of the mechanical parts but also reduction of operational stability and manufacturing efficiency. In order to solve these issues, <b>Mill</b> Stabilizing <b>Device</b> which consists of the hydraulic cylinder with orifices has been put into the practical use.

In this study, the influence of cryogenic, ball and knife mill devices and also sieving using different sizes of sieve (100, 300 and 500 μm) was evaluated for samples of bivalves, coffee and cowpea beans. A two-factor ANOVAwas performed in each sample to test for differences between macro, micro and trace element concentrations determined by ICP OES. Results showed that {{the efficiency of the}} particle size reduction and sample homogeneity depends on the <b>milling</b> <b>device</b> and the nature of samples. Food samples may present segregation after comminution, and sieving might become a necessary step. Nevertheless, the sieve aperture has to be chosen cautiously, once it might influence the final element concentration.

40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} cryogrinding on chemical stability of the diuretic agent furosemide and its mixtures with selected excipients. Methods Furosemide was ground at liquid nitrogen temperature for 30, 60, 120 and 180 min. Mixtures of furosemide-PVP and furosemide-inulin (1 : 1) were milled under cryogenic conditions. Materials were analyzed by XRD, UPLC, MS and NMR. Results Upon increasing the milling time, a significant build-up of an unidentified impurity 1, probably the main degradation product, was noticed. Cogrinding of furosemide with PVP and inulin worsened chemical stabilization of the pharmaceutical. The main degradation product formed upon cryomilling was subsequently identified as 4 -chloro- 5 -sulfamoylanthranilic acid (CSA). Based on some theoretical considerations involving specific milling conditions, the milling intensity and an expected specific milling dose have been calculated. Results indicate that cryogenic grinding is capable to initiate mechanically induced decomposition of furosemide. Conclusions Cryogenic grinding can activate and accelerate not only structural changes (solid state amorphization) but also chemical decomposition of pharmaceuticals.

40|$|Efficient {{preparation}} of food samples, comprising sampling and homogenization, for microbiological testing is an essential, yet largely neglected, component of foodstuff control. Salmonella enterica spiked chicken breasts {{were used as}} a surface contamination model whereas salami and meat paste acted as models of inner-matrix contamination. A systematic comparison of different homogenization approaches, namely, stomaching, sonication, and milling by FastPrep- 24 or SpeedMill, revealed that for surface contamination {{a broad range of}} sample pretreatment steps is applicable and loss of culturability due to the homogenization procedure is marginal. In contrast, for inner-matrix contamination long treatments up to 8 min are required and only FastPrep- 24 as a large-volume <b>milling</b> <b>device</b> produced consistently good recovery rates. In addition, sampling of different regions of the spiked sausages showed that pathogens are not necessarily homogenously distributed throughout the entire matrix. Instead, in meat paste the core region contained considerably more pathogens compared to the rim, whereas in the salamis the distribution was more even with an increased concentration within the intermediate region of the sausages.

For powders without natural fluidity, dosing device is situated between electromagnets creating constant magnetic field with horizontal induction lines and alternating gradient magnetic field with vertical induction lines and higher induction gradient in the lowest part of chamber with powder. This configuration allows development of uniform efflux speed of ferromagnetic powders from 2 mm diameter opening. For example, mass efflux speed of strontium ferrite powder with 1 μm average particle size in magneto-fluidized bed reached 181. 1 mg/s and the dosing time of 2000 mg of this powder was 11. 1 s.

40|$|A renewed {{interest}} in trace elements (TE), as micronutrients as well as potentially toxic elements, and new options for multi-element analysis {{has led to an}} increased number of scientists engaging in TE studies. Accreditation, certification and quality control of TE analyses often applies only to the last step in the sample chain when prepared samples are sent to the laboratory for digestion/extraction and subsequent analysis. However, all stages of the chain from initial sampling to final analysis require an understanding of the specific challenges involved in TE studies and an awareness of the contamination risks as well as approaches to limit these. Contamination can potentially be introduced during all stages of handling and preparation of plant samples, e. g. through dust and the materials that make up the different work surfaces, tools and containers used. <b>Milling</b> <b>devices</b> originally used during preparation of two sets of archived herbage samples were tested to indicate the degree of contamination that can arise from milling. For example, some of the <b>milling</b> <b>devices</b> tested showed effects on several TE concentrations while also increasing the variability between samples. A titanium knife mill which was included for comparison gave the best results, showing no measurable contamination by TE of primary interest, while it allowed a high throughput of samples. To enhance the quality of data on TE in bulky plant material such as herbage and to ensure future usability of newly archived samples, we suggest that field handbooks and sample preparation protocols (where needed) are revised to include precautions against TE contamination in all handling steps. This will ensure reliable data on concentrations of micronutrients and potential toxic TE in plant material...|$|R

The study of the dynamic structure factor S(E) as a function of energy for the as-cast FeSiB ribbon and for the milled samples reveals a depletion of the energy region around 10 meV with increasing the milling time, corresponding to the suppression of vibrational modes proper of the amorphous FeSiB alloy.

40|$|In {{mechanical}} treatment {{carried out by}} ball milling, powder particles are subjected to repeated high-energy mechanical loads which induce heavy plastic deformations together with fracturing and cold-welding events. Owing to the continuous defect accumulation and interface renewal, both structural and chemical transformations occur. The nature {{and the rate of}} such transformations have been shown to depend on variables, such as impact velocity and collision frequency that depend, in turn, on the whole dynamics of the system. The characterization of the ball dynamics under different impact conditions is then to be considered a necessary step in order to gain a satisfactory control of the experimental set up. In this paper we investigate the motion of a ball in a <b>milling</b> <b>device.</b> Since the ball motion is governed by impulsive forces acting during each collision, no analytical expression for the complete ball trajectory can be obtained. In addition, mechanical systems exhibiting impacts are strongly nonlinear due to sudden changes of velocities at the instant of impact.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of Neurosurgery craniectomy is a surgical procedure required due to diverse pathological processes. This procedure is usually performed manually by a surgeon using a <b>milling</b> <b>device.</b> As this procedure removes completely cranial bone, {{it has to be}} replaced by an implant. In order to achieve safety, efficiency of the process and accuracy for implant placement, such procedure requires good expertise and coordination of the surgeon. With the development of computer-assisted surgery and robotics, the application of such procedures took place also for craniectomy. These implementations are mainly intended to increase safety, accuracy and for optimization of the milling process. However the surgeon still has to be aware and perceive the status of the procedure to react or intervene in non-planned situations. The use of interface devices in terms of synergistic and haptic architectures is intended to re-integrate the surgeon to the control procedure, while preserving advantages of automatic parameter control. This work presents the investigation of the use of haptic technology in a neurosurgery robotic system for craniectomy, regarding aspects such as awareness, vigilance, workload, and safety as well as requirements of the milling process. A combination of haptic device and autonomous robot is proposed. For comparisons and evaluation of different operation modes (autonomous and synergistic as well as haptic master-slave interaction) experimental studies have been conducted using laboratory setups with different user groups, including computer based simulations. Results showed the potential of haptic technology in order to increase surgeons integration in the control of robotic system. Haptic feedback based control presented results similar to the autonomous implementation. Safety can be potentially increased due to faster surgeon reactions during the process, while milling process parameters could be controlled automatically. On the other hand, special care must be taken due to the increase of workload, however the haptic display solution showed lower increases compared to the synergistic mode...|$|E
