50|$|The {{danger of}} high {{exposure}} to radon in mines, where exposures can reach 1,000,000 Bq/m3, {{has long been}} known. In 1530, Paracelsus described a wasting disease of miners, the <b>mala</b> <b>metallorum,</b> and Georg Agricola recommended ventilation in mines to avoid this mountain sickness (Bergsucht). In 1879, this condition was identified as lung cancer by Herting and Hesse in their investigation of miners from Schneeberg, Germany. The first major studies with radon and health occurred {{in the context of}} uranium mining in the Joachimsthal region of Bohemia. In the US, studies and mitigation only followed decades of health effects on uranium miners of the Southwestern United States employed during the early Cold War; standards were not implemented until 1971.|$|E
