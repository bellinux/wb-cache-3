2500|$|A censure [...] or [...] is an {{expression}} of strong disapproval or harsh criticism. In parliamentary procedure, it is a debatable <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> that could be adopted by a majority vote. Among the forms that it can take are a stern rebuke by a legislature, a spiritual penalty imposed by a church, or a negative judgment pronounced on a theological proposition.|$|E
2500|$|The {{motion to}} censure is a <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> expressing a strong opinion of disapproval {{that could be}} debated by the {{assembly}} and adopted by a majority vote. According to Robert's Rules of Order (Newly Revised) (RONR), it is {{an exception to the}} general rule that [...] "a motion must not use language that reflects on a member's conduct or character, or is discourteous, unnecessarily harsh, or not allowed in debate." [...] Demeter's Manual notes, [...] "It is a reprimand, aimed at reformation of the person and prevention of further offending acts." [...] While there are many possible grounds for censuring members of an organization, such as embezzlement, absenteeism, drunkenness, and so on, the grounds for censuring a presiding officer are more limited: ...|$|E
2500|$|The new Parliament in 1983 again {{prompted}} {{supporters of}} capital punishment to put their case. Sir Edward Gardner's motion [...] "That this House favours {{the restoration of the}} death penalty for murder" [...] was debated on 13 July 1983, with several amendments moved to restrict capital punishment to certain categories of murder. The amendments were voted on first: capital punishment for murder [...] "resulting from acts of terrorism" [...] was rejected by 245 to 361, for murder [...] "of a police officer during the course of his duties" [...] by 263 to 344, for murder [...] "of a prison officer during the course of his duties" [...] by 252 to 348, for murder [...] "by shooting or causing an explosion" [...] by 204 to 374, and for murder [...] "in the course or furtherance of theft" [...] by 194 to 369. The <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> was then defeated by 223 to 368. Towards the end of the Parliament, a new clause proposed to the Criminal Justice Bill proposed to return the death penalty for [...] "A person convicted by the unanimous verdict of a jury of the premeditated killing of another person or of knowingly and intentionally killing another person in a manner, or for a reason, or in circumstances which a reasonable person would consider to be evil" [...] was rejected by 230 to 342 on 1 April 1987.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{debate on}} the motion to {{postpone}} indefinitely may go into {{the merits of the}} pending <b>main</b> <b>motion,</b> it may provide members of the assembly with additional opportunities to debate the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> beyond the number of speeches normally permitted by the rules. [...] It can also be used by opponents of a <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> to test whether they have the votes needed to defeat the <b>main</b> <b>motion,</b> without risking a direct vote. [...] If the motion to postpone indefinitely is defeated, direct consideration of the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> is resumed, and opponents of the motion may then determine whether to continue in their effort to defeat the <b>main</b> <b>motion.</b>|$|E
50|$|Postpone indefinitely—to end {{consideration}} of the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> for the balance of that session, without a direct vote on the <b>main</b> <b>motion.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> is {{a motion}} that brings {{business}} before the assembly. Main motions are made while no other motion is pending. Any of the subsidiary, incidental and privileged motions {{may be made}} while the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> is pending, {{and in many cases}} these motions, if passed, will affect the assemblys consideration of the <b>main</b> <b>motion.</b>|$|E
50|$|Using Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (RONR), all <b>main</b> <b>motions</b> can be amended. An {{amendment}} can be amended. However, {{the limit}} {{is that an}} amendment to an amendment may not be amended, {{because it would be}} too complicated.|$|R
50|$|All <b>main</b> <b>motions</b> are debatable. Other motions {{may or may}} not be debatable. The debatability of motions {{depends on}} the purpose of the motion. For example, the purpose of the motion to limit debate would be {{defeated}} if this motion itself could be debated; therefore, the motion to limit debate is not debatable.|$|R
50|$|A {{parliamentary}} structure conducts business through motions, {{which cause}} actions. Members bring business before the assembly by introducing <b>main</b> <b>motions,</b> or dispose {{of this business}} through subsidiary motions and incidental motions. Parliamentary procedure also allows for rules in regards to nomination, voting, disciplinary action, appeals, dues, and the drafting of organization charters, constitutions, and bylaws.|$|R
50|$|A {{subsidiary}} {{motion is}} a type of motion by which a deliberative assembly deals directly with a <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> prior to (or instead of) voting on the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> itself. Each subsidiary motion ranks higher than the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> and lower than the privileged motions, and also yields to applicable incidental motions. Some of the subsidiary motions may also be applied to certain other subsidiary motions, incidental motions and privileged motions.|$|E
5000|$|The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure has {{a motion}} to table. It can {{temporarily}} set aside a <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> (in which case it is also called the motion to postpone temporarily, a motion not in RONR) or it can kill the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> without a direct vote or further debate. TSC uses the short form, [...] "table", which is discouraged by RONR. If the motion to table is used in circumstances suggesting that {{the purpose is to}} kill the <b>main</b> <b>motion,</b> a two-thirds vote should be required.|$|E
50|$|Normally, this is {{a motion}} that {{introduces}} a substantive question as a new subject, in which case it is also called an original <b>main</b> <b>motion.</b> Otherwise, it is an incidental <b>main</b> <b>motion,</b> examples of which are the motions to adopt recommendations of a committee, to ratify action previously taken without a quorum, to rescind an action previously taken, or to adjourn or recess while no <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> is pending. Unlike original main motions, incidental main motions cannot have an objection to the consideration of the question applied to them.|$|E
50|$|Most {{state legislatures}} use Mason's Manual of Legislative Procedure. In this book, the motions {{to lay on}} the table and to take from the table have the same {{characteristics}} as under RONR. Mason's Manual has another motion, take from the desk, which a member uses when they desire to take up a matter that is on the desk, but on which no action has yet been taken. The differences between the two motions are that the motion to take from the table is used after an item has been placed on the desk by a previous use of a motion to lay {{on the table and}} the motion is given a preference over new <b>main</b> <b>motions</b> offered at the same time. Take from the desk is used when an item is taken up that has not yet been introduced and this motion has no preference over new <b>main</b> <b>motions</b> that may be made at the same time.|$|R
25|$|Equations {{of motion}} can {{therefore}} be grouped under these <b>main</b> classifiers of <b>motion.</b> In all cases, the <b>main</b> types of <b>motion</b> are translations, rotations, oscillations, or any combinations of these.|$|R
5000|$|In {{parliamentary}} procedure, {{a motion}} is {{a proposal to}} do something. The wording of such a proposal could be changed using the motion to amend. Amendments can remove words, add words, or change words in <b>motions.</b> All <b>main</b> <b>motions</b> and some secondary motions can be amended. An amendment can be amended. [...] However, an amendment to an amendment of an amendment is not allowed.|$|R
5000|$|Subsidiary motions, which {{affect the}} <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> being considered.|$|E
50|$|Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised {{does not}} have such a motion. However, the same effect could be done by having the maker of a <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> request to {{withdraw}} it. If the assembly approves this request, all adhering motions to the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> cease to be before the assembly as well.|$|E
50|$|The date {{to which}} the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> is being {{postponed}} is not too late {{for it to be}} effective. For example, if the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> proposes that there be a picnic on September 3, the motion cannot be postponed to September 5, because that would be too late for it to be carried out.|$|E
5000|$|Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised groups four motions {{under the}} {{classification}} name of [...] "Motions that bring a question again before the assembly", because by their adoption or by their introduction, they serve the function {{described by the}} name of the class: Take from the table, Rescind or amend something previously adopted, Discharge a committee, and Reconsider.

50|$|The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure (TSC) {{treats the}} motion to reconsider {{differently}} in the following ways. This motion could be made by any member (not just one who voted on the prevailing side). It is debatable only as to the reasons for reconsideration, and the original motion is opened for debate only if the motion for reconsideration passes. Only votes on <b>main</b> <b>motions</b> may be reconsidered (not secondary motions). If made while other business is pending, {{the motion to}} reconsider is taken up {{as soon as the}} other business is disposed of (it does not wait for someone to call up the motion).|$|R
50|$|Amend—to {{change the}} <b>main</b> <b>motion.</b> (May also {{be applied to}} certain other motions).|$|E
50|$|A {{proposed}} {{amendment is}} treated {{like many other}} motions in {{that it could be}} debated and voted on. This could be done even {{in the case of a}} friendly amendment. An amendment could pass with a majority vote, regardless of the vote required to pass the <b>main</b> <b>motion.</b> After passing or rejecting an amendment, the <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> would still need to be voted on.|$|E
50|$|Commit or Refer—to {{send the}} <b>main</b> <b>motion</b> and any pending {{subsidiary}} motions to a committee for consideration.|$|E
5000|$|The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure classifies five [...] "bring back" [...] motions {{under the}} {{classification}} of <b>main</b> <b>motions</b> but lists them under the title of [...] "Restorative Main Motions": Amend a previous action, Ratify, Reconsider, Rescind, and Resume Consideration. This book treats the motion to rescind and the motion to amend something previously adopted as two distinct motion forms under the [...] "Restorative Main Motions" [...] title. Also, the motion to discharge a committee is not used in this book because it allows a motion previously referred to committee to be withdrawn from the committee by the assembly. The motion to ratify is also included in this group.|$|R
40|$|Alpha solenoid {{proteins}} play a {{key role}} in regulating the classical nuclear import pathway, recognizing a target protein and transporting it into the nucleus. Importin-α (Impα) is the solenoid responsible for cargo protein recognition, and it has been extensively studied by X-ray crystallography to understand the binding specificity. To comprehend the <b>main</b> <b>motions</b> of Impα and to extend the information about the critical interactions during carrier-cargo recognition, we surveyed different conformational states based on molecular dynamics (MD) and normal mode (NM) analyses. Our model of study was a crystallographic structure of Impα complexed with the classical nuclear localization sequence (cNLS) from nucleoplasmin (Npl), which was submitted to multiple 100 ns of MD simulations. Representative conformations were selected for calculating the 87 lowest frequencies NMs of vibration, and a displacement approach was applied along each NM. Based on geometric criteria, using the radius of curvature and inter-repeat angles as the reference metrics, the <b>main</b> <b>motions</b> of Impα were described. Moreover, we determined the salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions in the Impα-NplNLS interface. Our results show the bending and twisting motions participating in the recognition of nuclear proteins, allowing the accommodation and adjustment of a classical bipartite NLS sequence. The essential contacts for the nuclear import were also described and were mostly in agreement with previous studies, suggesting that the residues in the cNLS linker region establish important contacts with Impα adjusting the cNLS backbone. The MD simulations combined with NM analysis can be applied to the Impα-NLS system to help understand interactions between Impα and cNLSs and the analysis of non-classic NLSs...|$|R
40|$|The {{model of}} {{nonlinear}} stiffness rotor-bearing system with crack fault was set up, and the nonlinear dynamic {{characteristics of the}} system were analyzed by numerical method. In critical rotational speed range, there are frequency division motions when the crack depth is sallow and chaotic motion when the crack is deep. In supercritical rotational speed range, the <b>main</b> <b>motions</b> are periodical frequency divisions. The numbers increase along with the depth of crack. In ultra-supercritical rotational speed range, there are quasi-periodic motion decreasing when the crack depth is sallow and periodical- 3 motion when the crack is deep. The conclusions provide a theoretic basis reference for the failure diagnosis to the nonlinear stiffness rotor-bearing systems with crack fault...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} reduce the {{information}} chaos of product design, we present the <b>main</b> <b>motions</b> of Design-Element based product design that we call it DE-PD. Different from traditional product design process composed of function, style, or customer requirements etc. al, DE-PD is driven by the knowledge and information flows in product design iteration. In DE-PD, the product is composed of Design-Elements (DE) which is the integration of related knowledge and information. After discussing the definition and information construct of DE, we present the iteration of DE based product design. To evaluate the method, a design case of beach motorcycle with limit mount of DEs is conceived. Evaluation results show that DE-PD is a promising approach for product design informatization...|$|R
