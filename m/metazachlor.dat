30|$|The Luxembourgish {{transposition}} of the EU {{drinking water}} and groundwater directive into national law contains a direct translation of the EU text on pesticides and their relevant and non-relevant metabolites. The highest concentration of <b>metazachlor</b> allowed in the groundwater and drinking water is therefore 0.1  µg/L and {{the sum of the}} concentrations of all pesticides must not exceed 0.5  µg/L. Despite the low toxicity of the two major <b>metazachlor</b> metabolites 479 M 04 and 479 M 08, they are both currently considered relevant. This denomination is based on the proposed designation of the parent <b>metazachlor</b> as carcinogenic category 3 R 40 (vide supra, point d). Henceforward, they are submitted to the same threshold of 0.1  µg/L. Because the treatment of the water at the SEBES plant allows to eliminate, on average, 90 % of <b>metazachlor</b> and its metabolites (maximum concentrations of 0.45  µg/L at the dam), the drinking water after treatment was, by law, still suitable for distribution following the <b>metazachlor</b> incident in Witry.|$|E
30|$|<b>Metazachlor</b> is {{classified}} as H 400 and H 410 designating acute and chronic aquatic hazard. Algae and higher aquatic plants, possessing high and constant amounts of VLCFAs are the most prone organisms to damage. Mohr et al, for example, showed that single exposure of several aquatic macrophytes to <b>metazachlor</b> at nominal concentrations of > 5  µg/L, had pronounced long-term effects on the aquatic biota [14]. In this study, even after 140 – 170  days, the macrophytes did not recover from punctual <b>metazachlor</b> treatments. Applied <b>metazachlor</b> concentrations of 20  µg/L in pond- and stream mesocosms led to a decrease in macrophyte wet weight of 25 and 77 %, respectively. In the same study [14], it was shown that filamentous green algae dominated by Cladophora glomerata and Spirogyra spec. were also extremely sensitive to <b>metazachlor</b> with EC 50 values of 3 and 9  µg/L (median effective concentration) in stream- and pond indoor mesocosms, respectively. These algae were replaced by the filamentous yellow–green algae Vaucheria spec, but only at <b>metazachlor</b> concentrations higher than the ones observed in the lake of the Upper-Sûre (> 80  µg/L). It is also known {{that the presence of}} <b>metazachlor</b> has repercussions on physicochemical parameters like pH and oxygen saturation via mechanisms implying biomass degradation and photosynthesis [14]. Next to factors like competition, there is reason to assume that these variations in physicochemical water parameters are also on the origin of species shifts, due to the different requirements of the communities.|$|E
30|$|Further {{decrease}} in concentration derives from dissipation mechanisms. Although <b>metazachlor</b> is stable to aqueous hydrolysis and photolysis in environmentally relevant conditions (sunlight, pH, and temperature) [13], Mohr et al. showed that <b>metazachlor</b> concentrations {{decrease in}} the water column following a first-order curve with DT 50 (median dissipation) values ranging from 37.4 to 47.9  days in lentic ecosystems, and from 27 to 44.2  days in lotic ecosystems [14]. In aerobic water–sediment studies, <b>metazachlor</b> disappeared with first-order DT 50 values of 13.4 to 27.8  days for the whole system [13]. In these investigations, <b>metazachlor</b> dissipated from the water phase with DT 50 values of 48.8 – 384  days, and from the sediment phase with DT 50 values of 3.0 – 6.8  days.|$|E
40|$|Crops {{resistant}} to glyphosate may mitigate the increasing {{contamination of the}} environment by herbicides, since their weeding requires smaller amounts of herbicides and fewer active ingredients. However, there are few published data comparing the fate of glyphosate with that of substitute herbicides under similar soil and climatic conditions. The objectives of the work reported here were (i) to evaluate and compare the fate in soil in field conditions of glyphosate, as used on glyphosate-resistant oilseed rape, with that of two herbicides frequently used for weed control on the same crop, albeit non-resistant: trifluralin and <b>metazachlor,</b> and (ii) to compare field results with predictions of the pesticide root zone model (PRZM), parameterized with laboratory data. Dissipation and vertical distribution in the soil profile of glyphosate, trifluralin and <b>metazachlor</b> were monitored in an experimental site located in Eastern France for 1 year. Herbicide persistence in the field increased as follows: <b>metazachlor</b> < glyphosate < trifluralin, contrary to laboratory results showing glyphosate to be least persistent. The main metabolite of glyphosate - aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) - was more persistent than glyphosate. AMPA and trifluralin had the largest vertical mobility, followed by <b>metazachlor</b> and glyphosate. PRZM underestimated the dissipation rate of glyphosate in the field and the formation of AMPA, but its predictions for trifluralin and <b>metazachlor</b> were correct. The simulation of herbicides and AMPA distribution in the soil profile was satisfactory, but the mobility of trifluralin and <b>metazachlor</b> was slightly underestimated, probably because PRZM ignores preferential flow. In general, data from the laboratory allowed an acceptable parameterization of the model, as indicated by goodness-of-fit indices. Because of the detection of AMPA in the deep soil layer, the replacement of both trifluralin and <b>metazachlor</b> with glyphosate might not contribute to decreasing environmental contamination by herbicides. PRZM may be used to evaluate and to compare other weed control strategies for herbicide-resistant as well as non-resistant crops...|$|E

30|$|In April 2015, {{the use of}} <b>metazachlor</b> became {{immediately}} and definitely banned in large surfaces of Luxembourg, including the protection zones 1, 2, the areas that are to become protection zones in the future (vide infra) and the entire supplying Luxembourgish watershed [26] (Fig.  4). Outside these zones, the use was regulated to 0.75  kg/ha, only 1 out of 4  years on the same surface. Prohibition to apply <b>metazachlor</b> in 2015 on surfaces on which it has been applied between 2012 and 2015 was also declared.|$|E
30|$|Although the {{successions}} {{of different}} algal populations are strongly dependent on nutrients (phosphor, nitrogen,…), mechanical constraints (flow velocity, convection,…), and biological factors (allelopathy,…), {{it is possible}} that there is, at least to some extent, an influence of <b>metazachlor</b> on population distributions in the lake of the Upper-Sûre due to changes in competition. This hypothesis is further corroborated by a study led by Mohr et al. who showed that chlorophytes were the most prone organisms to be harmed by <b>metazachlor</b> [20]. On the other hand, diatoms and cryptophytes seemed insensitive. It is possible that the selective action of <b>metazachlor</b> on the chlorophytes, preceding the cyanobacteria in time, provides an advantage to the proliferation of the cyanobacteria in the upstream dam and {{the first part of the}} lake of the Upper-Sûre. A similar shift from a dinoflagellate-dominated phytoplankton, to a community overshadowed by the blue algae Anabaena flos-aquae was monitored by Noack [21].|$|E

30|$|<b>Metazachlor</b> is only adsorbing {{moderately}} to soil, and the adsorption of the metabolites 479 M 04 and 479 M 08 is even weaker [13]. Consequently, {{the transportation}} of these substances {{from the water}} to the soil seems to be low. <b>Metazachlor</b> was degraded in the soil under field conditions with a mean DT 50 of 6.8  days [13]. The two metabolites 479 M 04 and 479 M 08 were found in aerobic degradation studies of [14 C-phenyl]metazachlor in soil at concentrations of 16 and 21 % of applied radioactivity. These two metabolites were measured after 91  days and further dissipated with DT 50 values of 56.4 and 71.1  days, respectively. Two further, minor metabolites were also detected (479 M 09 and 479 M 11).|$|E
30|$|The {{incident}} in Witry led to local concentrations of <b>metazachlor</b> and <b>metazachlor</b> metabolites {{in the lake}} of the Upper-Sûre that {{had the potential to}} harm, or at least, to alter the aquatic biota. The extent of these interactions is, however, due to limited amount of experimental data and the complexity of the ecosystem, not known. The risk for human water consumers was low due to the high dilution and the aptitude of the SEBES plant to eliminate between 70 and 98 % of <b>metazachlor</b> and his metabolites content. This led to concentrations of the regulated substances in the drinking water (after treatment) that were below the legal European and Luxembourgish threshold of 0.1  µg/L. More disturbing is the observation that the groundwater reservoir Scheidhof was already contaminated by the relevant metabolite 479 M 08. Based on the moderate degradation of the parent <b>metazachlor</b> in pure aquatic media, {{it is possible that the}} breakdown of 479 M 08 in the groundwater wells is also extremely time consuming. Furthermore, corroborated by the evolution of the concentration of 479 M 08 after the Witry incident (Fig.  3), there is a high chance that the lake was already transporting similar high concentrations of 479 M 08, due to agricultural activity. Although the concentrations are still far away from toxicological thresholds for humans, it is important to point out and to remind the precautionary principle extracted from the Water Framework Directive that groundwater must be regarded as a natural resource, which should be protected in its own right [29]. Limit values for active substances and their metabolites should not be based exclusively on human toxicological values but should aim at a maximum preservation of the water. It is considered appropriate that an adequate level of protection is established for groundwater.|$|E

40|$|Maize {{damage has}} been {{observed}} {{from time to time}} in many parts of South Africa where registered herbicides were applied. Differential cultivar tolerance to certain herbicides was identified as an important factor in many cases where herbicide selectivity was inadequate. A study was done to investigate the existence of differential tolerance of maize genotypes to selected herbicides. Several maize genotypes were screened for tolerance to selected herbicides, both in the greenhouse and in the field. Maize genotypes demonstrated significant differences in their tolerance to all herbicides. Some genotypes were severely injured by certain herbicides while others were not affected at all by the same herbicide. This suggests that maize genotypes should be screened for tolerance to herbicides in order to reduce crop injury by using only appropriate ones for specific genotypes. Generally, hybrids were more tolerant to herbicides than inbreds, indicating that screening may be most necessary in seed production, where inbreds are used, than in commercial production where only hybrids are used. Tolerance of maize to herbicides was more variable to <b>metazachlor</b> than to other herbicides, and <b>metazachlor</b> also injured more genotypes than other herbicides. This was probably due to differences in herbicide mechanism of action. Shoot or root dry mass reduction of some of the maize genotypes occurred without visual injury symptoms, thus suggesting that visual injury may not reliably indicate susceptibility or tolerance to herbicides. The degree of correspondence of herbicide effects on maize in the greenhouse and the field was determined. Comparison of results from the greenhouse and the field showed that there is positive correlation between herbicide effects in the greenhouse and in the field. There was generally good correspondence of major parameters, such as shoot dry mass and injury symptoms, in the greenhouse and in the field. Similarly these parameters were positively correlated with the grain yield obtained from the field. It appears that shoot dry mass and visual injury symptoms could be good predictors of the yield. This indicates that reliable data could be generated through quicker screening at greenhouse level. A total of four herbicides, <b>metazachlor,</b> dimethenamid, acetochlor and the combination atrazine / metolachlor / terbuthylazine, had significant correlations while only two, flufenacet and acetochlor + atrazine/sulcotrione, had no significant correlations for major parameters with the yield. This indicates that the correlation of data was herbicide-dependent. The influence of temperature on maize tolerance to alachlor, <b>metazachlor</b> and metolachlor was investigated. Results showed that low temperatures reduce the tolerance of maize to these herbicides. This could mean that low temperature may reduce the selectivity of these herbicides. Fluctuating temperature conditions of 10 °C at night and 35 °C during the day, which are found in some maize producing areas, did not affect maize tolerance to the herbicides. The possibility of improving <b>metazachlor</b> tolerance in maize was also investigated. Evidence provided for possible gene effects on the tolerance of <b>metazachlor</b> indicates that maize tolerance to the herbicide could be improved by crossing tolerant parents. The results suggest that it may be possible to improve <b>metazachlor</b> tolerance by crossing appropriate parent lines with dominant genes for tolerance to <b>metazachlor.</b> Ultrastructural changes in the maize seedling root and shoot cells caused by <b>metazachlor</b> were investigated. In susceptible genotypes root cell nucleoli were found to be abnormally large, empty and more abundant than those in untreated control plants. In susceptible plants the chromatids appeared disorganised in cell nucleoli, and both the nuclear and plasma membranes showed signs of disintegrating. There were more and larger vacuoles in the herbicide-susceptible plants. Leaf cells from the susceptible plants had more empty vacuoles and more chloroplasts with generally disorganised content. The bundle sheath chloroplast membranes were dilated in susceptible plants, and the orientation of the grana was disrupted. In the herbicide-tolerant plants, the ultrastructure was not different from that of all the untreated plants. The established differential tolerance of maize to herbicides necessitates the screening of all genotypes to all registered herbicides in order to recommend specific herbicides for certain maize genotypes. Due to the large number of genotypes that would require screening, techniques that yield reliable data quickly have obvious merit. Pot experiments under controlled conditions, which could be selected to promote herbicide bioactivity, are likely to provide data with which the best possible predictions on the risk of herbicide damage in the field could be made. Based on this requirement, environmental factors that should be considered for greenhouse work are: soil with low adsorptive capacity, soil water content close to the field capacity level, and cool temperatures. When screening for herbicide tolerance, the use of herbicide rates in excess of the recommended rate could obviate the need for special environmental conditions, since all the aforementioned factors basically promote the accumulation of higher than usual amounts of herbicide at the site of action in the plant. Therefore, the use of at least a 2 X-herbicide rate in screening experiments is advised. Thesis (PhD (Plant Production: Weed Science)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

30|$|This {{discussion}} is centralized around {{an incident that}} took place in the Belgian village Witry the 17 th of September 2014. A tractor accident led to the discharge of an aqueous solution of the herbicide <b>metazachlor</b> into the creek Moyémont that further merges into the river Sûre. About 20  km downstream, these waters supply the lake of the Upper-Sûre in Luxembourg, the biggest artificial lake and the main drinking water reservoir in the country. The evolution of the concentration of <b>metazachlor</b> and its metabolite 479 M 08 was partially tracked down from the river Sûre to the dam situated in the east. At this location, the SEBES drinking water treatment plant has its raw water intake from the lake. After this incident, substantial pollution by the <b>metazachlor</b> breakdown product 479 M 08 of the lake and of some other groundwater sources in the Grand Duchy was revealed due to a strong monitoring program that was started by the national water authority (AGE). This was for example the case in the SEBES groundwater resource Scheidhof close to Luxembourg City. There is also the reason to assume that contamination by 479 M 08 existed already in the lake before the incident in Witry, certainly due to agricultural activity. In the second part of this discussion, these perceptions are placed in their appropriate political context. Indeed, the quality of groundwater and drinking water is strongly regulated in the European Union and in Luxembourg. Compound 479 M 08, for instance, is submitted to a maximum parametric value of 0.1  µg/L in Luxembourg.

Mineralization and oxidation of organic contaminants were monitored with total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) analysis. Titanium dioxide powders prepared via sol-gel method and doped with dysprosium and praseodymium were photocatalytically active for decomposition of <b>metazachlor.</b> The highest degradation rate of <b>metazachlor</b> was observed when Pr-TiO 2 treated at 450 ºC (8 h) was used. The photocatalytic LED-based treatment of wastewater effluent from plywood mill using commercially available TiO 2 was demonstrated to be promising post-treatment method (72 % of COD and 60 % of TOC was decreased after 60 min of irradiation). The TiO 2 coatings prepared by atomic layer deposition technique on aluminium foam were photocatalytically active for degradation of formic and phenol, however suppression of activity was observed. Photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 /SiO 2 films doped with gold bipyramid-like nanoparticles was about two times higher than reference, which was not the case when gold nanospheres were used...|$|E
30|$|Although {{this sounds}} like a {{plausible}} rationale, care has to be taken with this assumption because algal distribution depends on a plethora of different parameters. Toxicological studies on aquatic organisms of metabolites 479 M 04 and 479 M 08 show that they are, at least three orders of magnitude, less toxic than the parent <b>metazachlor.</b> In general, the risk of these compounds is assessed to be of little importance [13]. Due to the two-dimensional nature of the topic (environment and legislation), we will now try to place the incident in Witry in its legal context.|$|E

40|$|International audienceResidues of {{pesticides}} in fish farming productions from barrage ponds are seldom studied {{in spite of}} increasing health questionings and environmental concerns. The {{purpose of this study}} is to establish the pesticide contamination profiles of sediments and edible fish from five ponds in Northeastern France. Multi-residues method and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis were used to quantify 13 pesticides (azoxystrobin, carbendazim, clomazone, diflufenican, dimethachlor, fluroxypyr, iprodion, isoproturon, mesosulfuron-methyl, <b>metazachlor,</b> napropamid, quizalofop and thifensulfuron-methyl). Ten sediments and 143 muscles samples were analysed, corresponding to two successive fishing campaigns (first fishing date and second fishing date (P 2), about 1 year later) on five sites (noted C- 0, C- 25, C- 45, C- 75 and C- 85 to express the increasing gradient of crop area). Isoproturon was present in all sediments samples (1. 8 - 56. 4 mu g/kg dry weight). During P 2 period, carbendazim was quantified in the fish of site C- 0 (0. 09 +/- 0. 02, 0. 2 +/- 0. 1 and 0. 17 +/- 0. 06 mu g/kg wet weight (ww) for roach, carp and perch, respectively). <b>Metazachlor</b> was only quantified in perch of the site C- 25 (0. 13 +/- 0. 02 mu g/kg ww). Concentrations of isoproturon were similar for the sites C- 45 and C- 75 with 0. 4 +/- 0. 1 and 0. 75 +/- 0. 06 mu g/kg ww for carp and perch, respectively. Contamination of fish reflected generally concentrations in surroundings. Isoproturon was the most concentrated and its main source was water for perch while carp was exposed through both water and sediments, highlighting their life strategies in pond...|$|E
40|$|Two {{herbicides}} clomazone and <b>metazachlor</b> were non-competitively inhibited {{the activities}} of chorismate mutase (CM, EC 5. 4. 99. 5), prephenate dehydratase (PD, EC 5. 2. 1. 51), acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS, 4. 1. 3. 18) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL, 4. 3. 1. 5) in cotyledons of Lupinus termis. Inhibition was dependent on the type and concentration of each individual herbicide. L-tryptophan and its analog 5 -methyltryptophan activated CM and PD while L-tyrosine, m -fluorotyrosine, p -fluorophenylalanine and L-phenylalanine inhibited both enzymes particularly in herbicide-treated seedlings. PAL was inhibited by phenylpropanoid intermediates involved in flavonol and anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway particularly p-coumaric acid, naringenin and quercetin. PAL inhibition by these intermediates was more pronounced in cotyledons of herbicide-treated seedlings. The levels of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, anthocyanin and nucleic acids were decreased by the two tested herbicides...|$|E
40|$|International audienceReductive dechlorinations are {{especially}} promising reactions {{for improving the}} biodegradability and hence decreasing {{the environmental impact of}} chlorinated organic pollutants. In this context, the catalytic activity of a bipyridyl cobalt complex containing two bipyridine ligands was examined for achieving clean electrochemical dehalogenation in aqueous media. The prepared [Co(bpy(CH 2 OH) 2) 2] 2 + complex was found to exhibit high catalytic activity toward the dechlorination of chloroacetanilide herbicides. Based on preparative electrolyses, 2 -electron reduction of the substrate was obtained with a dechlorination yield of 85 %, underlining the selectivity and efficiency of the dehalogenation process. Cyclic voltammetry analyses highlighted the catalytic activity of the complex toward chloroacetanilide herbicides, as alachlor, metolachlor and <b>metazachlor.</b> An high apparent chemical rate constant k 1 of 5000 mol− 1 L s− 1 is calculated for the first step of the cathodic reduction of alachlor, based on simulated cyclic voltammetry experiment...|$|E
40|$|Three {{populations of}} {{silky bent grass}} (Apera spica-venti L.) were tested – one that is {{susceptible}} and two that are resistant to sulfonylureas. This study assessed the efficacy of control by different herbicides in a pot experiment and estimated the molecular status of resistance to sulfonylureas in analysed populations {{and its effect on}} the efficacy of different chemical treatments. The three most effective herbicide rotation schemes were: 1) chlorsulfuron + isoproturon, ethametsulfuron + <b>metazachlor</b> + quinmerac, chlorsulfuron + isoproturon; 2) prosulfocarb + diflufenican, ethametsulfuron + quizalofop-p-ethyl, prosulfocarb + diflufenican; 3) diflufenican + flufenacet, quizalofop-p-ethyl, diflufenican + flufenacet. In most cases it was more difficult to destroy 100 % of the resistant population from Modgarby where the majority of plants had no mutation in the als gene. In the resistant population from Babin there were significantly more individuals with mutation in the als gene, therefore exhibiting target-site resistance...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePesticides {{residues}} in aquatic {{ecosystems are}} an environmental concern which requires efficient analytical methods. In this study, {{we proposed a}} generic method for the quantification of 13 pesticides (azoxystrobin, clomazone, diflufenican, dimethachlor, carbendazim, iprodion, isoproturon, mesosulfuron-methyl, <b>metazachlor,</b> napropamid, quizalofop and thifensulfuron-methyl) in three environmental matrices. Pesticides from water were extracted using a solid phase extraction system and a single solid-liquid extraction method was optimized for sediment and fish muscle, followed by a unique analysis by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Limits of quantification were below 5 ng L− 1 for water (except for fluroxypyr and iprodion) and ranged between 0. 1 ng g− 1 and 57. 7 ng g− 1 for sediments and regarding fish, were below 1 ng g− 1 for 8 molecules and were determined between 5 and 49 ng g− 1 for the 5 other compounds. This method was finally used as a new routine practice for environmental research...|$|E
40|$|Pesticide {{pollution}} of surface {{water is a}} major concern in many agricultural catchments The development of rapid and accurate methods for determining pesticide concentrations in water samples is, therefore, important. Here we describe a method for the simultaneous analysis of six pesticides (metaldehyde, quinmerac, carbetamide, <b>metazachlor,</b> propyzamide and pendimethalin) in natural waters by direct aqueous injection with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The method validation showed good linearity from 0. 2 to 50. 0 µg/L with correlation coefficients between 0. 995 and 0. 999. Method accuracy ranged from 84 to 100 % and precision Relative standard deviation (RSD) from 4 to 15 %. The limits of detection for the targeted pesticides ranged from 0. 03 to 0. 36 µg/L. No significant matrix effects on quantification were observed (t-test). The method was tested on water samples from a small arable catchment in eastern England. Peak concentrations for the determinands ranged from 1 to 10 µg/L...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePesticide {{residues}} in fish muscle are {{an environmental}} and a health safety concern which requires analytical methods presenting high sensitivity and low limits of quantification. In this study, adapted QuEChERS method, coupled to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (Scheduled MRM- 5500 QTRAP), {{was developed to}} quantify 13 pesticides (azoxystrobin, clomazone, diflufenican, dimethachlor, carbendazim, iprodion, isoproturon, mesosulfuron-methyl, <b>metazachlor,</b> napropamid, quizalofop and thifensulfuron-methyl) in muscle of fish. Quantification limits were below 1 ng g− 1 except for clomazone (1. 8 ng g− 1) and quizalofop (7. 4 ng g− 1). Best recoveries were observed for perch (> 80 %) and roach (> 68 %), except for thifensulfuron-methyl. Lower recoveries had been observed for carp (6 % to 86 %). Relative standard deviation was lower than 28 % for intra-day and 29 % for inter-day analysis, respectively. This method was successfully tested on three fish species, naturally or orally exposed: roach (Rutilus rutilus), perch (Perca fluviatilis) and carp (Cyprinus carpio). Few levels were observed in fish naturally exposed, but carp and perch orally contaminated showed measurable levels in their muscles...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-seven polar pesticides, mainly triazines, phenylurea {{herbicides}} and phenoxy acids, {{were determined}} by LC-atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation MS-MS with methanol and acetonitrile as the organic modifiers. For most pesticides, detection limits were the same irrespective of the modifier. However, for the phenylurea herbicides, propachlor, carbetamide, triadimefon, triadimenol, triethylcitrate, benzothiazole and <b>metazachlor,</b> the results were much poorer {{in the presence of}} acetonitrile; in several cases, no meaningful results were obtained at all. When carrying out trace enrichment of 100 ml water samples on a 10 x 2 mm I. D. solid-phase extraction precolumn containing a polymeric sorbent, rapid desorption with a small volume of pure organic solvent and the introduction of a T-piece in between the solid-phase extraction precolumn and the analytical column was necessary. Aliquots of 300 μl of acetonitrile were optimal for the complete desorption of all analytes from the sorbent. With methanol as the modifier and when using an identification criterion of three ions, the detection limits for most analytes, in the full-scan mode, were 10 - 100 ng/l. The linearity of the procedure, which was tested at the 0. 1 and 1 μg/l levels, was satisfactory in the positive, but not in the negative ionisation mode. The procedures were used to analyse surface water samples. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E
