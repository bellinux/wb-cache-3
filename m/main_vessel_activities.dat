40|$|ObjectivesThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the functional significance of side branches after stent implantation in <b>main</b> <b>vessels</b> using fractional flow reserve (FFR). BackgroundLittle is known about the functional significance of side branches after stent implantation in <b>main</b> <b>vessels</b> in coronary bifurcation lesions. MethodsBetween May 2007 and January 2011, 230 side branches in 230 patients after stent implantation in <b>main</b> <b>vessels</b> were assessed by FFR and were consecutively enrolled. ResultsMedian FFR at the side branch was 0. 91 (interquartile range: 0. 85 to 0. 95). There was a negative correlation between the diameter stenosis (DS) by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and FFR of side branch (r = − 0. 21, p = 0. 002), but only 41 (17. 8 %) side branches were functionally significant after stent implantation in the <b>main</b> <b>vessel.</b> Among 67 side branches with > 50 % DS by QCA, 19 (28. 4 %) had FFR ≤ 0. 80, and among 163 side branches with ≤ 50 % DS by QCA, 22 (13. 5 %) had FFR ≤ 0. 80 after stent implantation in <b>main</b> <b>vessels.</b> On the basis of receiver-operating characteristic curves, the optimal cutoff value of DS by QCA of the side branch was 54. 9 %, and the area under the curve was 0. 64 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 58 to 0. 71, p < 0. 001) with a 41. 5 % sensitivity, an 83. 1 % specificity, a 34. 7 % positive predictive value, an 86. 3 % negative predictive value, and a 75. 7 % accuracy. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis identified DS by QCA (odds ratio [OR]: 1. 04, 95 % CI: 1. 02 to 1. 06, p = 0. 001) and reference vessel diameter (OR: 0. 28, 95 % CI: 0. 10 to 0. 77, p = 0. 014) before stent implantation as independent predictors of the side branches with FFR ≤ 0. 80 after stent implantation. ConclusionsMost side branch lesions do not have functional significance after stent implantation in the <b>main</b> <b>vessel,</b> and quantitative coronary angiography is unreliable in assessing the functional severity of these lesions...|$|R

40|$|Background: The optimal {{strategy}} in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for coronary artery bifurcation lesions {{has yet to}} be agreed upon. We compared a strategy for stenting the <b>main</b> <b>vessel</b> to provide a complete perfusion flow in the side branch, namely thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) - III, with a strategy for intervention in both the <b>main</b> <b>vessel</b> and the side branch (MV + SB). Methods: This retrospective study utilized data on 258 consecutive patients with bifurcation lesions scheduled for PCI at Tehran Heart Center between March 2003 and March 2008. The patients were followed up for 12 months, and the primary end point was a major adverse cardiac event (MACE), i. e. cardiac death, myocardial infarction, target-vessel revascularization, and target-lesion revascularization during the 12 -month follow-up period. Results: A total of 52. 7 % of the patients underwent PCI on the <b>main</b> <b>vessel</b> of the bifurcation lesions (MV group) and 47. 3 % with a similar lesion type received a percutaneous intervention on both the <b>main</b> <b>vessel</b> and the side branch (MV + SB group). The total rate of MACE during the follow-up was 4. 3 % (11 patients); the rate was not significantly different between the MV and MV + SB groups (3. 7 % vs. 4. 9 %, respectively; p value = 0. 622). Conclusion: There was no association between MACE in performing a simple or complex interventional strategy to treat coronary bifurcation lesions when drawing the TIMI- III flow as a goal in a simple technique. </p...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the feasibility of performing contemporary bifurcation techniques with the Absorb everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, California) (BVS). BackgroundThe feasibility of using the BVS in bifurcation lesions is unknown. MethodsWe performed bifurcation stenting procedures including main-vessel stenting with ballooning of the side branch through the BVS struts, T-stenting and crush and culotte procedures, in a synthetic arterial model. Low-pressure final kissing balloon (FKB) inflation was performed to complete the procedures. ResultsSingle-stent procedures optimally opened the side-branch ostium without deforming the <b>main</b> <b>vessel</b> BVS. T-stenting completely covered the side-branch ostium. In crush cases, we could easily re-cross the crushed BVS with the wire and balloon and achieve good results after deployment of the main-vessel BVS and FKB inflation. A 2 -BVS culotte resulted in good paving of the <b>main</b> <b>vessel.</b> Disruption of 1 BVS strut was observed after FKB inflation with the 2 balloons inflated beyond the recommended limit of the BVS, as calculated by Finet's law. ConclusionsIntervention of bifurcation lesions using the Absorb BVS using modern bifurcation techniques appears feasible in a coronary bifurcation model. Provisional stenting is recommended in the majority, with sequential balloon inflations and FKB inflation only when necessary. T or T-stenting and small protrusion stenting with a metal drug-eluting stent is preferable in case of crossover. A  2 -BVS, T-stent technique can be performed in a high-angle bifurcation; otherwise, crush or culotte should be considered, using metal DES in the side branch. Two-BVS crush and culotte require careful evaluation, and should only be considered in patients with large-caliber <b>main</b> <b>vessels...</b>|$|R
