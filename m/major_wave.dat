5|$|Contemporary Mangalorean Catholics are descended {{mainly from}} the Goan Catholic settlers, who {{migrated}} to Canara from Goa, a state north of Canara, between 1560 and 1763 in three major waves. The first wave of immigrants came to Mangalore to escape the trials of the Goa Inquisition of 1560. These migrants were welcomed by the native Bednore rulers of Canara for their agricultural skills. They were followed by a second <b>major</b> <b>wave</b> precipitated by the Portugal–Adil Shahi wars between 1570 and 1579. A final influx of immigrants arrived during the Portugal–Maratha wars in Goa during the late 17th and early 18thcenturies. According to Mangalorean historian Alan Machado Prabhu, the Mangalorean Catholics numbered about 58,000 {{by the time of}} the capture of Canara by Hyder Ali in 1765.|$|E
5|$|In 1542, the Navarrese Jesuit Francis Xavier, {{co-founder of}} the Society of Jesus; arrived in Goa. He {{discovered}} that the newly converted Christians were practising their old Hindu customs and traditions. He requested the Portuguese king João III to install an Inquisition in Goa in 1545. Many of the Goan ancestors of the present Mangalorean Catholics fled Goa when the Inquisition began in 1560. King Sebastião I decreed that every trace of Indian customs should be eradicated through the Inquisition. Many Christians of Goa were tenaciously attached to some of their ancient Indian customs, especially their traditional Hindu marriage costumes, and refused to abandon them. Those who refused to comply were forced to leave Goa and to settle outside the Portuguese dominion, {{which resulted in the}} first <b>major</b> <b>wave</b> of migrations towards South Canara.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{immigration}} {{in the late}} 20th century and early 21st century has fueled new communities of Hispanics and Asians. , 9.0% of Virginians are Hispanic or Latino (of any race), and 6.5% are Asian. The state's Hispanic population rose by 92% from 2000 to 2010, with two-thirds of Hispanics living in Northern Virginia. Hispanic citizens in Virginia have higher median household incomes and educational attainment than the general Virginia population. As far as Hispanic groups, {{there is a large}} Salvadoran population in the DC suburbs of Northern Virginia, and a large Puerto Rican population in the Hampton Roads region of Southeast Virginia. Northern Virginia also has a significant population of Vietnamese Americans, whose <b>major</b> <b>wave</b> of immigration followed the Vietnam War, and Korean Americans, whose migration has been more recent and was induced in part by the quality school system. The Filipino American community has about 45,000 in the Hampton Roads area, many of whom have ties to the U.S. Navy and armed forces.|$|E

5|$|Political {{tensions}} {{came to a}} head as {{elections to}} the provincial assembly of East Bengal were held in 1954. The ruling Muslim League denounced the opposition United Front coalition, which—led by A. K. Fazlul Huq and the Awami League—wanted greater provincial autonomy. Several United Front leaders and activists were arrested. A meeting of parliament's Muslim League members, chaired by prime minister Muhammad Ali Bogra, resolved to give official recognition to Bengali. This decision was followed by a <b>major</b> <b>wave</b> of unrest as other ethnic groups sought recognition of other regional languages. Proponents of Urdu such as Maulvi Abdul Haq condemned any proposal to grant official status to Bengali. He led a rally of 100,000 people to protest against the Muslim League's decision. Consequently, the implementation failed and the United Front won a vast majority of seats in the legislative assembly, while the representation of the Muslim League was reduced to a historic low.|$|E

25|$|Researchers {{identified}} three <b>major</b> <b>waves</b> of human migrations into Europe: the original mesolithic hunter-gatherers, neolithic farmers from the Caucasus and Anatolia about 8000 years ago, {{and a third}} wave about 5000 years ago from the Yamna culture, horse-riding herders from the Pontic–Caspian steppe.|$|R
25|$|Southern Athabaskan (also Apachean) is a {{subfamily}} of Athabaskan languages spoken {{primarily in}} the Southwestern United States (including Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah) and the Mexican state of Sonora, with two outliers in Oklahoma and Texas. Those languages are spoken by various groups of Apache and Navajo peoples. In the northern versions, Athabaskan is spoken by many indigenous groups of peoples in Alaska and Canada. It represents the third <b>major</b> <b>wave</b> of ancient migration from Asia.|$|E
25|$|The {{first case}} of SARS in Toronto, Canada was {{identified}} on February 23, 2003.

The trajectory of this outbreak is typically divided into two phases, with the second <b>major</b> <b>wave</b> of cases clustered around accidental exposure among patients, visitors, and staff within a major Toronto hospital. The WHO officially removed Toronto from its list of infected areas by the end of June, 2003.|$|E
25|$|Colorado {{became the}} first western state to host a major {{political}} convention when the Democratic Party met in Denver in 1908. By the U.S. Census in 1930, the population of Colorado first exceeded one million residents. Colorado suffered greatly through the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, but a <b>major</b> <b>wave</b> of immigration following World War II boosted Colorado's fortune. Tourism became a mainstay of the state economy, and high technology became an important economic engine. The United States Census Bureau estimated that the population of Colorado exceeded five million in 2009.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the lead}} mining area drew the first <b>major</b> <b>wave</b> of settlers, its {{population}} {{would soon be}} eclipsed by growth in Milwaukee. Milwaukee, along with Sheboygan, Manitowoc, and Kewaunee, {{can be traced back}} to a series of trading posts established by the French trader Jacques Vieau in 1795. Vieau's post at the mouth of the Milwaukee River was purchased in 1820 by Solomon Juneau, who had visited the area as early as 1818. Juneau moved to what is now Milwaukee and took over the trading post's operation in 1825.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} Bronze Age the island {{experienced}} two waves of Greek settlement. The first wave consisted of Mycenaean Greek traders who started visiting Cyprus around 1400 BC. A <b>major</b> <b>wave</b> of Greek settlement {{is believed to}} have taken place following the Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece from 1100 to 1050BC, with the island's predominantly Greek character dating from this period. Cyprus occupies an important role in Greek mythology being the birthplace of Aphrodite and Adonis, and home to King Cinyras, Teucer and Pygmalion. Beginning in the 8th centuryBC Phoenician colonies were founded on the south coast of Cyprus, near present-day Larnaca and Salamis.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>major</b> <b>wave</b> of aliyah from Ethiopia {{took place}} in the mid-1970s. The massive airlift known as Operation Moses began to bring Ethiopian Jews to Israel on November 18, 1984, and ended on January 5, 1985. During those six weeks, some 6,500–8,000 Ethiopian Jews were flown from Sudan to Israel. An {{estimated}} 2,000–4,000 Jews died en route to Sudan or in Sudanese refugee camps. In 1991 Operation Solomon was launched to bring the Beta Israel Jews of Ethiopia. In one day, May 24, 34 aircraft landed at Addis Ababa and brought 14,325 Jews from Ethiopia to Israel. Since that time, Ethiopian Jews have continued to immigrate to Israel bringing the number of Ethiopian-Israelis today to over 100,000.|$|E
50|$|Kulaks were a {{group of}} {{relatively}} affluent farmers and had gone by this class-system term in the later Russian Empire, Soviet Russia, and early Soviet Union.

25|$|For the {{remainder}} of the 17th century, Irish Catholics tried to get the Cromwellian Act of Settlement reversed. They briefly achieved this under James II during the Williamite war in Ireland, but the Jacobite defeat there led to another round of land confiscations. During the 1680s and 90s, another <b>major</b> <b>wave</b> of settlement took place in Ireland (though not another plantation in terms of land confiscation). At this time, the new settlers were principally Scots, tens of thousands of whom fled a famine in the lowlands and border regions of Scotland to come to Ulster. At this point Protestants and people of Scottish descent (who were mainly Presbyterians) became an absolute majority of the population in Ulster.|$|E
25|$|After Aliyah Bet, {{the process}} of {{numbering}} or naming individual aliyot ceased, but immigration did not. A <b>major</b> <b>wave</b> of Jewish immigration, mainly from post-Holocaust Europe and the Arab and Muslim world took place from 1948 to 1951. In {{three and a half}} years, the Jewish population of Israel, which was 650,000 at the state's founding, was more than doubled by an influx of about 688,000 immigrants. In 1949, the largest-ever number of Jewish immigrants in a single year - 249,954 - arrived in Israel. This period of immigration is often termed kibbutz galuyot (literally, ingathering of exiles), due to the large number of Jewish diaspora communities that made aliyah. However, kibbutz galuyot can also refer to aliyah in general.|$|E
25|$|Their {{histories}} are diverse. As {{with the}} new immigration from central and eastern Europe to the East Coast from the mid-19th century on, Asians started immigrating to the United States in large numbers in the 19th century. This first <b>major</b> <b>wave</b> of immigration consisted predominantly of Chinese and Japanese laborers, but also included Korean and South Asian immigrants. Many immigrants also came during and after this period from the Philippines, which was a US colony from 1898 to 1946. Exclusion laws and policies largely prohibited and curtailed Asian immigration until the 1940s. After the US changed its immigration laws during the 1940s to 1960s to make entry easier, a much larger new wave of immigration from Asia began. Today the largest self-identified Asian American sub-groups according to census data are Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, Indian Americans, Vietnamese Americans, Korean Americans, and Japanese Americans, among other groups.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} three <b>major</b> <b>waves</b> of Indian immigrants, the first between 1899 and 1913, the second after India was granted {{independence}} from the United Kingdom in 1947, and the third after the immigration quota for individual countries was lifted in 1965. , the New York City metropolitan area contains the largest Asian Indian population in North America.|$|R

25|$|The IWW {{competed for}} {{the hearts and}} minds of members with the communist-dominated unions, and held union locals well into the 1940s. With the younger {{generation}} rapidly being assimilated into dominant Canadian society, the IWW and CTKL in Northwestern Ontario became friendship and mutual aid societies for an aging membership. In the late 1960s, following the last <b>major</b> <b>wave</b> of Finnish immigration to Canada, a new organization called the Finlandia Club of Port Arthur became the majority share holder of the hall. The new wave of immigrants were a generation separated from their Finnish-Canadian brethren and had no connection to the social struggles of the past. In addition, the newly arriving immigrants were either a-political or conservative, associating any left-wing activity with the brutality of Stalinism and the Finnish Winter War; this despite the fact that the Finnish Wobblies in Canada and the U.S. had actively supported and aided Finland in the war against the Soviet Union and denounced Bolshevism, from a libertarian socialist perspective, since the Kronstadt uprising.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of recent}} {{immigration}} {{in the late}} 20th century and early 21st century, there are rapidly growing populations from Latin America, Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean, especially in Northern Virginia. Northern Virginia, which {{is a part of}} the DC metropolitan area, is one of the most diverse regions in the country. Virginia has one of the largest Salvadoran populations in the US, the vast majority of which is concentrated in Northern Virginia. Northern Virginia also has the largest Vietnamese population on the East Coast, with about 48,000Vietnamese statewide as of 2007, their <b>major</b> <b>wave</b> of immigration followed the Vietnam War. The Hampton Roads area in southeastern Virginia, though it lags far behind Northern Virginia in diversity, is second in the state compared to other metro areas; aside from 'native' blacks and whites, the Hampton Roads only has large populations of Filipinos, Mexicans, and Puerto Ricans. The Hampton Roads area has the highest percentage of Puerto Ricans of any metropolitan area in the Southern US outside Florida, and also has a sizable Filipino population with about 45,000 in the area, many of whom have ties to the U.S. Navy. As of 2005, 6.1% of Virginians are Hispanic and 5.2% are Asian. Virginia also continues to be home to eight Native American tribes recognized by the state, though all lack federal recognition status. Most Native American groups are located in the Tidewater region.|$|E
500|$|The last <b>major</b> <b>wave</b> of British {{immigrants}} to the colonies took place in 1720–1775. About 250,000 people travelled across the Atlantic primarily to seek economic betterment and to escape hardships and famine. Most of these came from the borderlands of northern Britain and were of Scots-Irish or Scottish descent. Many were poor and therefore accustomed to hard times, setting them apart from the other major British immigrant groups. They settled in what would {{come to be known}} generally as the [...] "backcountry", on the frontier and in the highlands in the north and south.|$|E
