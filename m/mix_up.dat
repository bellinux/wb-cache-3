5|$|In February 2011, Dugan {{demonstrated}} an automixer card, marketed by Yamaha, to plug into the accessory slot of a Yamaha digital mixer {{such as the}} O1V96, LS9, M7CL or PM5D. This card, the Dugan-MY16, could <b>mix</b> <b>up</b> to 16 channels of microphone inputs, assigned to selected inserts in the mixer's graphic user interface. Like the Model E-1, the automixer could be adjusted through a web browser interface, allowing remote control with an iPad, touchscreen computer or laptop over wireless network. The Dugan algorithm moved inside Yamaha's QL-eeries of mixers in March 2014, as an option on the graphic equalizer processing page. This internal version could mix 8 or 16 microphones.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's league {{campaign}} {{started on}} 9 August 1997, with an away fixture at Leeds United. The match {{ended in a}} 1–1 draw; Ian Wright scored his first goal of the season, before a <b>mix</b> <b>up</b> in defence meant Leeds striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink equalised for the home team. Two days later, at home to Coventry City, Wright scored both goals in Arsenal's 2–0 win, leaving the striker one goal away from equalling Cliff Bastin's club goalscoring record. Two goals from Dennis Bergkamp and a debut goal by midfielder Marc Overmars, the following week helped Arsenal to win at Southampton. In spite of Bergkamp scoring a hat-trick against Leicester City, Arsenal drew the match 3–3, having conceded a third in the sixth minute of stoppage time. A further draw at home to rivals Tottenham Hotpsur, for whom defender Sol Campbell particularly impressed, meant Arsenal ended August in fifth position.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} of Sam and Max {{were created in}} Purcell's youth; Purcell's younger brother Dave originally came up with several comics around {{the idea of a}} dog and rabbit detective duo. Dave would often leave unfinished comics around the house. Deliberately making the characters <b>mix</b> <b>up</b> each other's names, shoot at each other and mock {{the way in which they}} had been drawn, Steve, in a case of sibling rivalry, would sometimes finish the stories in parodies of their original form. This developed from Steve mocking his brother's to the creation of his own stories with the characters. In the late 1970s, Dave Purcell gave Steve the rights to the characters; he signed them over in a contract on Steve's birthday and allowed him to develop the characters in his own way. Purcell believes that his younger brother has recovered and forgiven him from their earlier years. Having kept one as a pet in his youth, Purcell has an interest in rats, which are commonly featured in his artistic work.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{their poor}} reputation, the Besser shorts did have their comedic moments. In general, the remakes had the {{traditional}} Stooges knockabout look and feel, such as 1958's Pies and Guys (a scene-for-scene remake of Half-Wits Holiday, which {{itself was a}} reworking of the earlier Hoi Polloi), Guns a Poppin (1957), Rusty Romeos (1957) and Triple Crossed (1959). In contrast, Hoofs and Goofs, Horsing Around and Muscle Up a Little Closer (all 1957) mostly resembled the sitcoms of the era. A Merry <b>Mix</b> <b>Up</b> (also 1957) and Oil's Well That Ends Well (1958) are also amusing, while the musical Sweet and Hot (1958) deserves some credit for straying from the norm. The American space craze also led to three entries focusing on space travel: Space Ship Sappy, Outer Space Jitters (both 1957) and Flying Saucer Daffy (1958).|$|E

The clever solutions MacGyver implemented to seemingly unsolvable problemsoften in life-or-death situations requiring him to improvise complex devices {{in a matter of}} minuteswere a major attraction of the show, which was praised for generating interest in the applied sciences, particularly engineering, and for providing entertaining storylines. All of MacGyver's exploits on the show were ostensibly vetted by consulting scientists for the show's writers to ensure a basis on scientific principles (even though, the creators acknowledged, in real life one would have to be extraordinarily lucky for most of MacGyver's ideas to succeed).

25|$|Borg {{had one of}} {{the most}} {{distinctive}} playing styles in the Open Era. He played from the baseline, with powerful ground-strokes. His highly unorthodox backhand involved taking his racket back with both hands but actually generating his power with his dominant right hand, letting go of the grip with his left hand around point of contact, and following through with his swing as a one-hander. He hit the ball hard and high {{from the back of the}} court and brought it down with considerable topspin, which made his ground strokes very consistent. There had been other players, particularly Rod Laver and Arthur Ashe, who played with topspin on both the forehand and backhand, yet Laver and Ashe used topspin only as a way to <b>mix</b> <b>up</b> their shots to pass their opponents at the net easily. Borg was one of the first top players to use heavy topspin on his shots consistently.|$|E

25|$|At the 1999 tournament, South Africa faced Australia in {{the final}} match of the Super Six round; Australia needed to win {{to qualify for the}} semifinals, whereas South Africa had already done so. Australia boasted a {{superior}} recent record in must-win matches against South Africa. Media speculation was focused on Woolmer's team being less adept at handling high pressure situations. In the 1997/98 Australian international season, Australia had lost all four of their qualifying matches against South Africa in a triangular tournament and conceded a 1–0 finals series lead, before recovering to take the series 2–1. The Super Six match saw Australia win the match in the last over, after Herschelle Gibbs dropped Australian captain Steve Waugh in a premature celebration of a catch. Waugh went on to score an unbeaten century and score the winning runs. The semifinal rematch saw a late Australian comeback culminate in a tie, when with match scores level, South African batsmen Lance Klusener and Allan Donald had a <b>mix</b> <b>up,</b> with Donald dropping his bat and being run out. As a result South Africa were eliminated due to their inferior performance in the earlier matches. and Woolmer resigned.|$|E
25|$|One major {{drawback}} in cumulative scoring {{is that it}} is {{more complicated}} task in keeping track than in the transfer system. In the 1980s at least two national level scoring scandals (one in 1985) in which the national professional number one was decided after the Grand nationals underlined this. There was also a scoring <b>mix</b> <b>up</b> during the 1983 NBL Grand National in which it was thought Brian Patterson was the winner for two weeks but after a recount initiated after Eric Rupe protested gave Eric Rupe the number one for 1983. An even larger scoring scandal occurred in 1985 in which pro racer Peter Loncarevich apparently beat Greg Hill for the number one pro racer by a mere 3 points. Greg Hill's wife Nancy (who was the bookkeeper for Greg Hill's BMX bicycle company Greg Hill Products) kept an independent accounting of the season points of Mr. Hill's closest competitors and detected an error. At his wife's urging Mr. Hill ask for and received an audit of the points and the NBL confirmed the error had taken place and awarded Mr. Hill the pro title for 1985.|$|E
25|$|The third Test at Old Trafford {{followed}} the same course, ending in a draw after rain washed out the fourth day {{and much of the}} second, although it was an eventful match for Evans. In Australia's first innings he took three dismissals; however he dropped two earlier chances to dismiss Neil Harvey and Alan Davidson, the miss of Harvey was costly as he went on to make 122, having been 52 at the time. In England's innings, Evans scored a quick 44 not out in 39 minutes on what was at that stage a wet wicket. Evans took three further dismissals in Australia's second innings as they collapsed to 35/8. At Leeds, more rain and England's defensive batting ensured a fourth draw of the series. Batting first England scored 167 in 109.4 overs, Evans's contribution was 25 runs in 90 minutes. Three England players suffered injuries {{during the course of the}} innings; the third of these was Bailey who twisted his knee as he attempted to make his ground after a <b>mix</b> <b>up</b> with Evans. Facing a 99-run deficit, England continued to bat slowly in their second innings adding 275 in 177.3 overs, Bailey batted over four hours with the tail on the final day to leave Australia one hour and fifty-five minutes to chase 177; they were 30 short when play ended.|$|E
