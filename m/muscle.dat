5|$|<b>Muscle</b> cells (myocytes) {{form the}} active {{contractile}} tissue of the body. <b>Muscle</b> tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. <b>Muscle</b> is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types; smooth <b>muscle,</b> skeletal <b>muscle</b> and cardiac <b>muscle.</b> Smooth <b>muscle</b> has no striations when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility {{over a wide}} range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Skeletal <b>muscle</b> contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated <b>muscle</b> is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and {{this is the type of}} <b>muscle</b> found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions. In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth <b>muscle</b> is found in the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, and blood vessels. Cardiac <b>muscle</b> is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{axillary}} arch may insert {{into the}} tendon of the pectoralis major <b>muscle,</b> the fascia of the coracobrachialis <b>muscle,</b> or the fascia covering the biceps brachii <b>muscle.</b> Insertion into the pectoralis major <b>muscle</b> proper, the long {{head of the}} biceps brachii <b>muscle,</b> the coracoid process, the pectoralis minor <b>muscle,</b> the axillary fascia and to the bone at {{the crest of the}} greater tubercle of the humerus inserting distal to the insertion of the pectoralis major <b>muscle</b> have all been reported.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} skull, the cranial {{component}} detaches from the spinal component. The spinal accessory nerve continues alone and heads backwards and downwards. In the neck, the accessory nerve crosses the internal jugular vein around {{the level of}} the posterior belly of digastric <b>muscle.</b> As it courses downwards, the nerve pierces through the sternocleidomastoid <b>muscle</b> while sending it motor branches, then continues down until it reaches the trapezius <b>muscle</b> to provide motor innervation to its upper part.|$|E
50|$|The {{intrinsic}} <b>muscles</b> {{are divided}} into respiratory and the phonatory <b>muscles</b> (the <b>muscles</b> of phonation). The respiratory <b>muscles</b> move the vocal cords apart and serve breathing. The phonatory <b>muscles</b> move the vocal cords together and serve the production of voice. The extrinsic, passing between the larynx and parts around; and intrinsic, confined entirely. The main respiratory <b>muscles</b> are the posterior cricoarytenoid <b>muscles.</b> The phonatory <b>muscles</b> {{are divided into}} adductors (lateral cricoarytenoid <b>muscles,</b> arytenoid <b>muscles)</b> and tensors (cricothyroid <b>muscles,</b> thyroarytenoid <b>muscles).</b>|$|R
50|$|Trunk <b>muscles</b> can be broadly {{divided into}} hypaxial <b>muscles,</b> which lie ventral to the {{horizontal}} septum of the vertebrae and epaxial <b>muscles,</b> which lie dorsal to the septum. Hypaxial <b>muscles</b> include some vertebral <b>muscles,</b> the diaphragm, the abdominal <b>muscles,</b> and all limb <b>muscles.</b> Epaxial <b>muscles</b> include other (dorsal) <b>muscles</b> {{associated with the}} vertebrae, ribs, and base of the skull. In humans, the erector spinae, the transversospinal <b>muscles</b> (including the multifidus, semispinalis and rotatores), the splenius and suboccipital <b>muscles</b> are the only epaxial <b>muscles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The infrahyoid <b>muscles</b> (strap <b>muscles)</b> are a {{group of}} four pairs of <b>muscles</b> in the {{anterior}} (frontal) part of the neck. The four infrahyoid <b>muscles</b> are: the sternohyoid, sternothyroid, thyrohyoid and omohyoid <b>muscles.</b>|$|R
5|$|Any form of <b>muscle</b> {{damage of}} {{sufficient}} severity can cause rhabdomyolysis. Multiple causes can be present simultaneously in one person. Some have an underlying <b>muscle</b> condition, usually hereditary in nature, {{that makes them}} more prone to rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{skeletal}} <b>muscle</b> {{may take}} various forms. Crush and other physical injuries cause damage to <b>muscle</b> cells directly or interfere with blood supply, while non-physical causes interfere with <b>muscle</b> cell metabolism. When damaged, <b>muscle</b> tissue rapidly fills with fluid from the bloodstream, including sodium ions. The swelling itself {{may lead to}} destruction of <b>muscle</b> cells, but those cells that survive are subject to various disruptions that lead to rise in intracellular calcium ions; the accumulation of calcium outside the sarcoplasmic reticulum leads to continuous <b>muscle</b> contraction and depletion of ATP, the main carrier {{of energy in the}} cell. ATP depletion can itself lead to uncontrolled calcium influx. The persistent contraction of the <b>muscle</b> cell leads to breakdown of intracellular proteins and disintegration of the cell.|$|E
5|$|Hypertonia – Hypertonia {{is marked}} by an {{abnormal}} increase in <b>muscle</b> tension and reduced ability of a <b>muscle</b> to stretch. Hypertonia may result from injury, disease, or conditions which involve damage to {{the central nervous system}} (e.g. cerebral palsy).|$|E
50|$|The suboccipital <b>muscles</b> are a {{group of}} <b>muscles</b> defined by their {{location}} to the occiput. Suboccipital <b>muscles</b> are located below the occipital bone. These are four paired <b>muscles</b> {{on the underside of}} the occipital bone; the two straight <b>muscles</b> (rectus) and the two oblique <b>muscles</b> (obliquus).|$|R
40|$|The {{interosseous}} and lumbrical <b>muscles</b> in twenty-five {{hands of}} Japanese adult cadavers were dissected. The palmar and dorsal interosseous <b>muscles</b> continued, with few exceptions, into the wing tendons. The dorsal interosseous <b>muscles</b> gave off tendons which pierced the transverse laminae or passed deep to the transverse laminae, {{and attached to}} the bases of the proximal phalanges. The palmar interosseous <b>muscles</b> seldom had such attachments. The palmar and dorsal interosseous <b>muscles</b> sometimes gave off additional tendons which passed superficial to the transverse laminae and attached to the bases of the proximal phalanges. These latter attachments were typical in the contrahentes <b>muscles.</b> Thus, the present {{findings suggest that the}} human dorsal interosseous <b>muscles</b> are composite <b>muscles</b> derived from the dorsal abductor, flexor brevis and contrahens <b>muscles,</b> and that the human palmar interosseous <b>muscles</b> are composite <b>muscles</b> derived from the flexor brevis and contrahens <b>muscles.</b> The lumbrical <b>muscles</b> rarely gave off accessory slips with atavistic attachments to the proximal phalanges. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{deterioration}} of tibialis anterior (TA) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) <b>muscles</b> in dystrophic mice (C 57 BL dy/dy) was compared.

5|$|In cardiac <b>muscle,</b> cTnC binds to cardiac {{troponin}} I (cTnI) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT), whereas cTnC binds to slow skeletal troponin I (ssTnI) and troponin T (ssTnT) in slow-twitch skeletal <b>muscle.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Muscle</b> {{cells have}} another {{specialized}} function of smooth ER. The ER membrane pumps calcium ions from the cytosol into the cisternal space. When a <b>muscle</b> cell becomes stimulated by a nerve impulse, calcium goes {{back across the}} ER membrane into the cytosol and generates the contraction of the <b>muscle</b> cell.|$|E
5|$|Myosin {{regulatory}} {{light chain}} 2, ventricular/cardiac <b>muscle</b> isoform (MLC-2) {{also known as}} the regulatory light chain of myosin (RLC) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MYL2 gene.

5000|$|There {{are three}} types of <b>muscles</b> - cardiac, skeletal, and smooth. Smooth <b>muscles</b> are used to control the flow of {{substances}} within the lumens of hollow organs, and are not consciously controlled. Skeletal and cardiac <b>muscles</b> have striations that are visible under a microscope due to the components within their cells. Only skeletal and smooth <b>muscles</b> {{are part of the}} musculoskeletal system and only the skeletal <b>muscles</b> can move the body. Cardiac <b>muscles</b> are found in the heart and are used only to circulate blood; like the smooth <b>muscles,</b> these <b>muscles</b> are not under conscious control. Skeletal <b>muscles</b> are attached to bones and arranged in opposing groups around joints. [...] <b>Muscles</b> are innervated, to communicate nervous energy to, by nerves, which conduct electrical currents from the central nervous system and cause the <b>muscles</b> to contract.|$|R
50|$|Pharyngeal <b>muscles</b> are {{striated}} <b>muscles</b> of {{the head}} and neck. Unlike skeletal <b>muscles</b> that developmentally come from somites, pharyngeal <b>muscles</b> are developmentally formed from the pharyngeal arches.|$|R
5|$|Nerve cells. Sensory cells appear between or {{sometimes}} {{on top of}} the <b>muscle</b> cells, and communicate via synapses (gaps across which chemical signals flow) with motor nerve cells, which lie mostly between the bases of the <b>muscle</b> cells.|$|E
5|$|Neutrophil granulocytes—the most {{abundant}} type of white blood cell—enter the <b>muscle</b> tissue, producing an inflammatory reaction and releasing reactive oxygen species, particularly after crush injury. Crush syndrome may also cause reperfusion injury when {{blood flow to}} decompressed <b>muscle</b> is suddenly restored.|$|E
5|$|One {{mechanism}} {{involved in}} recovery is nerve terminal sprouting, in which remaining brainstem and spinal cord motor neurons develop new branches, or axonal sprouts. These sprouts can reinnervate orphaned <b>muscle</b> fibers {{that have been}} denervated by acute polio infection, restoring the fibers' capacity to contract and improving strength. Terminal sprouting may generate a few significantly enlarged motor neurons doing work previously performed {{by as many as}} four or five units: a single motor neuron that once controlled 200 <b>muscle</b> cells might control 800 to 1000 cells. Other mechanisms that occur during the rehabilitation phase, and contribute to <b>muscle</b> strength restoration, include myofiber hypertrophy—enlargement of <b>muscle</b> fibers through exercise and activity—and transformation of type II <b>muscle</b> fibers to type I <b>muscle</b> fibers.|$|E
50|$|Brief {{doses of}} {{electrical}} stimulation can strengthen <b>muscles</b> {{in the lower}} pelvis in a way similar to exercising the <b>muscles.</b> Electrodes are temporarily placed in the vagina or rectum to stimulate nearby <b>muscles.</b> This can stabilize overactive <b>muscles</b> and stimulate contraction of urethral <b>muscles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Agonist <b>muscles</b> and {{antagonist}} <b>muscles</b> {{refer to}} <b>muscles</b> that cause or inhibit a movement.|$|R
40|$|Cytosol {{prepared}} {{from the}} hind-limb <b>muscles</b> {{of the rat}} contained factors which increased the acetylcholine (ACh) contractures in intact normally innervated <b>muscles</b> in vitro. <b>Muscles</b> which had been denervated 4 - 6 days previously and normally innervated <b>muscles</b> released a factor upon incubation which increased the ACh responses of normal <b>muscles.</b> The normal <b>muscles,</b> however, also released an inhibitor of this effect. The medium obtained after incubation of the <b>muscles</b> contained a variety of hydrolytic enzymes including phospholipase C, acid protease and calcium-activated neutral protease. The amounts of phospholipase C released by normal and denervated <b>muscles</b> were similar, but approximately four times more of the two proteases {{was released from the}} denervated <b>muscles</b> than from normal <b>muscles.</b> The possibility that these hydrolases could be the factors which increased the ACh sensitivity in normal <b>muscles</b> is discussed...|$|R
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of vertebrate TnI isoforms demonstrated {{that each of}} the <b>muscle</b> type-specific isoforms is more conserved across species than the three isoforms in one given species, indicating early diverged functions of the <b>muscle</b> fiber type-specific isoforms as well as the conservation of functions for each <b>muscle</b> fiber type.|$|E
5|$|Possible {{homologous}} {{structures in}} other {{species have been}} identified as the dorsoepitrochlearis <b>muscle,</b> the pectoralis quartus <b>muscle</b> or the panniculus carnosus. The dorsoepitrochlearis is an important climbing <b>muscle</b> in monkeys and apes where it has its origin in the tendinous region of the latissimus dorsi and extends down the arm as a superficial <b>muscle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Recurrent {{rhabdomyolysis}} {{may result}} from intrinsic <b>muscle</b> enzyme deficiencies, which are usually inherited and often appear during childhood. Many structural <b>muscle</b> diseases feature episodes of rhabdomyolysis that are triggered by exercise, general anesthesia {{or any of the}} other causes of rhabdomyolysis listed above. Inherited <b>muscle</b> disorders and infections together cause the majority of rhabdomyolysis in children.|$|E
40|$|There {{are three}} pairs of {{suspensory}} <b>muscles</b> in the larva of Tipula abdominalis which originate dorso-laterally between body segments one through four and insert laterally along the mid-gut and on the mid-portion of the Malpighian tubules. Cytologically these <b>muscles</b> resemble body wall <b>muscles</b> more than gut <b>muscles.</b> In the living animal, the <b>muscles</b> probably take up slack and keep the gut and Malpighian tubules from being displaced unduly. Although the existence of suspensory <b>muscles</b> in some insect larvae has been recognized for some time, few descriptions of these <b>muscles</b> have actually been published. Lyonet (1762) {{was the first to}} describe such <b>muscles,</b> in the carpenter moth, Cossus cossus. He observed seven pairs of these <b>muscles</b> which extended from intersegmental portions of the body wall to various places on the mid-gut, hind-gut, Malpighian tubules, and silk glands. He called these "trunk " <b>muscles.</b> Much later, a second observation of such <b>muscles</b> was made in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Tanaka (1911) described nine pairs of <b>muscles</b> which he called "dermo-visceral " <b>muscles.</b> They originated on the body wall between segment...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to characterise the thermal {{properties}} of connective tissue in loose structured porcine SM <b>muscles</b> in comparison to normal looking SM <b>muscles</b> and to see whether the meat quality traits were related to the properties of connective tissue. Samples from the <b>muscles</b> with loose structure and light colour were selected by visual assessment and normal looking SM <b>muscles</b> were used as a control (n = 25 loose structured + 25 control). The loose structured <b>muscles</b> had lower ultimate pH (pHu) than the control <b>muscles.</b> The onset and peak temperatures of thermal shrinkage of intramuscular connective tissue (To and Tp, respectively) in loose structured <b>muscles</b> were similar to those of control <b>muscles</b> when the full set of data (25 loose structured + 25 control) were analysed.
