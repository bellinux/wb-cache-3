40|$|ABSTRACT: American Dollar (USD) and Indian Rupee (INR) play an {{important}} role in Mauritian economy. It is important to model the pattern of dependence in their co-movement with respect to <b>Mauritian</b> <b>Rupee</b> (MUR), as this may indicate the export-import behavior in Mauritius. However, it is known that distributions of exchange rates are usually non-normal and the use of linear correlation as a dependence measure is inappropriate. Moreover it is quite difficult to obtain the joint distribution of such random variables in order to specify the complete covariance matrix to measure their dependence structure. In this paper, we first identify the marginal distributions of the exchange rates of MUR against USD and INR and then select the best fitting copula model for the bivariate series. It is concluded that both the series are asymmetric and fat-tailed following hyperbolic distribution. Their dependence structure is appropriately modeled by t copula...|$|E

30|$|Herwartz and Reimers (2002) {{analyzed}} daily {{exchange rate}} changes between the Deutsche mark (DM) and the US dollar and the DM and the Japanese yen (JPY) for the period from 1975 to 1998. They used a GARCH(1, 1) model with leptokurtic innovations to capture volatility clustering, and {{they found that the}} identified points of structural change were subject to changes in monetary policies in the US and Japan. Similarly, Çağlayan, Ün, and Dayıoğlu (2013) modeled the exchange rate volatility of MIST (Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, and Turkey) countries against the US dollar using asymmetric GARCH models. They used monthly exchange rate data for the period from 1993 to 2013 to investigate leverage effects and fat-tailed features. They identified the existence of asymmetrical and leveraging effects in the exchange rates of MIST countries against the US dollar. Vee, Gonpot, and Sookia (2011) also examined the forecasting accuracy of GARCH(1, 1) using Student’s t and generalized error distribution (GED). Using daily data for exchange rates between the US dollar and the <b>Mauritian</b> <b>rupee,</b> they compared the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) of the models based on forecasting estimates. They found that GARCH(1, 1) with GED had better forecasting accuracy compared to that using Student’s t-distribution.|$|E
