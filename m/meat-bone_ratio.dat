40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{experiment}} {{was to determine the}} growth and carcass production of Ongole grade cattle (PO) and Simmental Ongole (SimPO) crossbred cattle kept in a feedlot system. Six PO cattle and six SimPO crossbred cattle with the respective initial body weight of PO 315. 6 ± 39. 46 kg and SimPO 368. 3 ± 17. 81 kg, were kept for 3 months and fed with concentrates, elephant grass, soybean hulls and cassava. At the end of treatment all cattle were slaughtered. The observed variables included feed consumption, feed digestibility, daily weight gain, feed conversion, feed cost per gain, blood urea and blood glucose levels, carcass cuts weight, carcass yield, carcass percentage, carcass component, and <b>meat-bone</b> <b>ratio.</b> The obtained data were analyzed using the t-test. The treatments significantly affected carcass weight and carcass percentage (P< 0. 05), but it did not affect on feed consumption, feed digestibility, average daily gain, feed conversion, feed cost per gain, blood urea and blood glucose levels, carcass component, and <b>meat-bone</b> <b>ratio.</b> In conclusion, the SimPO crossbred had higher carcass weight and carcass percentage, and the feed cost per gain more efficient compared to PO cattle.
