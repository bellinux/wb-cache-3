40|$|This paper evaluates some {{learning}} {{models and}} explores {{the possibility of}} extending the linear learning models by adding explanatory variables, using Lilien's model {{as a point of}} departure. Two parameter estimation schemes are proposed and applied: one at the micro-level using consumer panel data (micro-data) and the other at the macro-level using aggregate time-series data (<b>macro-data).</b> The use of micro-data restrains the estimation of effects to a limited number of decision variables in Lilien's model, {{because of a lack of}} degrees of freedom. It is shown that by modifying the equations of Lilien's model and by considering more than two brands the number of degrees of freedom can be increased considerably. This opens the possibility of estimating the response parameters of many more explanatory variables, in theory. However, practically speaking, estimation remains difficult because the parameters in the modified model are heavily restricted by standard probabilistic and other constraints. The endeavor to estimate the parameters of the modified linear learning model using <b>macro-data</b> is not feasible. This leads to the conclusion that the application of learning models in the area of decision-making in marketing is rather difficult and limited. marketing: buyer behavior, marketing: measurement, marketing: pricing...|$|E
40|$|Endogenous growth theory {{shows the}} crucial {{importance}} of R&D for economic growth. However, {{the effectiveness of}} R&D policies {{is limited by the}} low wage elasticities of the supply of R&D workers. Estimating these elasticities for the Netherlands is hampered by the lack of appropriate micro-data. The empirical literature suggests that estimating wage elasticities from <b>macro-data</b> may be impossible. However, we show that the identification problem can be solved by performing the instrumental variables approach in a cointegration framework. We apply this estimation approach to <b>macro-data</b> from the R&D Survey of Statistics Netherlands. The wage elasticity of the supply of R&D workers in the Netherlands is 0. 96 in the short run and 1. 20 in the long run. When R&D expenditure is increased, the demand side of the labour market for R&D workers compensates for the short-run inflexibility of the supply side by strong wage increases in the short run and weaker responses in the long run. As a result, a 1. 0 % increase in real R&D spending will lead to a 0. 5 % increase in the employment of R&D workers, both in the short run and in the long run...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{documents}} the changing impact of {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) on gendered wages in urban China. Combining household survey data from 1995 and 2002 with province-level <b>macro-data,</b> the paper finds that FDI {{as a proportion of}} investment has a sizable and statistically significant positive effect on both female and male wages in both years. In 1995, women experienced larger gains from FDI than men, but those gender-based advantages had reversed by 2002, with men experiencing larger wage gains from FDI than women. The paper argues that these results reflect the shift of foreign-invested enterprises to higher productivity and more domestically oriented production, a shift that interacts with gender-based employment segregation to more greatly advantage workers in male-dominated than female-dominated industries. These findings indicate that FDI can have considerable structural effects on economies that reach beyond the particular workers and firms linked to foreign investors.

By comparing {{the results of}} two household surveys, conducted in 1986 and 2004 respectively, {{we are able to}} trace the economic reflection of this process in the standard of living of the Kinois (the inhabitants of Congo's capital, Kinshasa). Although the exercise is fraught with methodological problems, it nevertheless generates some salient outcomes. First and foremost, the available evidence unanimously points to a slight increase in the general standard of living, thereby contradicting the official <b>macro-data.</b> Further, given an increase in inequality, it is well possible that the period of transition was experienced increasingly unequally by different population groups. Third, {{one of the most significant}} changes observed is that Kinshasa has become more closely connected with world (food) markets.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a background {{context for the}} further symposium contributions in this issue. It argues that any debate on changes in the workplace must be rooted in specific organizational contexts. The contexts are being altered by changes in technology (telecommunications and information) and heightened competitive pressures brought about by internationalization. However, this {{does not necessarily mean}} that traditional forms of work (particularly mass production) have been eradicated. Rather, they have been increasingly dispersed to less-developed economies (LDCs) and newly industrialized economies (NIEs). This process is again set within an organizational context, as multinational corporations have been at the core of such spatial restructuring. Moreover, information technology has been facilitative of such changes. Finally, the paper notes that much of the empirical data, particularly large-scale <b>macro-data,</b> does not point to the transformational change that is described and predicted in some of the more polemic accounts of the future of work. Rather, more incremental changes are indicated. Indeed, a more measured approach to accounts of change is called for, based on rigorous and robust empirical research...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{regards the}} {{incidence}} of in-work poverty {{and how it is}} reduced by the payment of social transfers in 20 European countries. It combines a micro- and a macro-level perspective in two-level models. The basis for the analysis is micro-data from the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) 2005 and <b>macro-data</b> from sources such as the OECD and Eurostat. The broad comparative perspective allows for a separation of different institutional influences, namely the influence of the degree of decommodification, defamilisation and bargaining centralisation. In contrast to previous studies on the working poor which have mainly described country differences in in-work poverty, this paper focuses on the question of how such differences can be ex-plained from a broader perspective of poverty research. In general, the results confirm the overall hypothesis that both welfare state measures and labour market institutions have an influence on in-work poverty. By analysing influences on pre-transfer poverty and poverty reduction separately, I show that such factors have varied effects on in-work poverty. While bargaining centralisation proves to be relevant for the distribution of pre-transfer incomes only, the set-up of the social security system in particular im-pacts the extent of poverty reduction. ...|$|E
