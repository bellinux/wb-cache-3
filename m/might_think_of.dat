5|$|One of Wollstonecraft's central {{arguments}} in the Rights of Woman is that women should be educated in a rational manner {{to give them the}} opportunity to contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and conduct book writers, who wrote what one <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> as early self-help books, that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as Catharine Macaulay and Hester Chapone, maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787), in her children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788), {{as well as in the}} Rights of Woman.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} reform {{of all was}} the emancipation of the serfs, a policy that was unpopular with large sections of the nobility. When the committee appointed to bring it about dug in their heels and made difficulties, Alexander II asked Konstantin to join the committee in September 1857. Where the Tsar was unsure of himself, his younger brother was more forceful, quick tempered, and cared not what others <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him.|$|E
500|$|In {{their native}} Oregon, the Daddies {{have been called}} [...] "a Northwest institution", having been {{inducted}} into the Oregon Music Hall of Fame in 2009. The Register-Guard has credited the band with shaping Eugene's alternative musical culture in the 1990s, while Eugene Weekly added likewise, [...] "when some people think of the Northwest music scene, they think of grunge. If you’re a Eugenean, however, you <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> swing, thanks to [...] Cherry Poppin' Daddies". Seattle's The Rocket commented on the band's influence in 1997, stating [...] "he Daddies were busting out the swing before the Squirrel Nut Zippers, stirring cocktails before Combustible Edison and skating the ska before Sublime...the band shakes out an incredible variety of sounds with peerless verve and polish." ...|$|E
500|$|Also that month, Cosmopolitan {{published}} {{the first interview}} with Manning in prison, conducted by mail. Cosmo reported that Manning was optimistic about recent progress but said that not being allowed to grow her hair long was [...] "painful and awkward … I am torn up. I get through each day okay, but at night, when I'm alone in my room, I finally burn out and crash." [...] Manning said it was [...] "very much a relief" [...] to announce {{that she is a}} woman and did not fear the public response. [...] "Honestly, I'm not terribly worried about what people out there <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> me. I just try to be myself." [...] According to Cosmo, Manning had her own cell with [...] "two tall vertical windows that face the sun", and could see [...] "trees and hills and blue sky and all the things beyond the buildings and razor wire". Manning denied being harassed by other inmates and claimed some had become confidantes.|$|E

500|$|John Janick, the {{chairman}} and CEO of Interscope Geffen A Records, told Stefani that he was unsure of her songs [...] "connect with people", encouraging her to create an [...] "artistic record" [...] and to skip radio altogether. Janick later {{changed his mind and}} got in touch with Stefani after listening to [...] "Used to Love You". She called it [...] "the most personal song" [...] she'd ever written and appreciated Janick's decision commenting: [...] "That's never happened in my entire career." [...] After writing [...] "Truth", she was inspired to title the album with something similar. By the time several personal themed tracks were completed, Stefani began creating songs dealing with her newfound relationship with Shelton; [...] "Make Me Like You" [...] details [...] "the early stage of their romance", while the title track suggests what the public <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> their romance, with lyrics such as: [...] "They’re all gonna say I’m rebounding, so rebound all over me".|$|E
500|$|Charles Eaton died in Frankston on 12November 1979. Survived by {{his wife}} and two sons, he was cremated. In {{accordance}} with his wishes, his ashes were scattered near Tennant Creek, site of his 1929 forced landing during the search for the Kookaburra, from an RAAF Caribou on 15April 1981. His name figures prominently in the Northern Territory, commemorated by Lake Eaton in Central Australia, Eaton Place in the Darwin suburb of Karama, Charles Eaton Drive on the approach to Darwin International Airport, and the Charles Moth Eaton Saloon Bar in the Tennant Creek Goldfields Hotel. He is also honoured with a display at the Northern Territory Parliament, and a National Trust memorial at Tennant Creek Airport. At the RAAF's 2003 History Conference, Air Commodore Mark Lax, recalling Eaton's search-and-rescue missions between the wars, commented: [...] "Today, we <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Eaton perhaps as the pioneer of our contribution to assistance to the civil community—a tradition that continues today. Perhaps I might jog your memory to a more recent series of rescues no less hazardous for all concerned—the amazing location of missing yachtsmen Thierry Dubois, Isabelle Autissier and Tony Bullimore by our P-3s that guided the Navy to their eventual rescue. My observation is that such activities remain vital for our relevance in that we must remain connected, supportive and responsive to the wants and needs of the Australian community." ...|$|E
500|$|MacDermot {{followed}} Hair {{with three}} successive rock scores: Two Gentlemen of Verona (1971); Dude (1972), a second collaboration with Ragni; and Via Galactica (1972). [...] While Two Gentlemen of Verona found receptive audiences and a Tony for Best Musical, Dude failed after just sixteenperformances, and Via Galactica flopped after a month. [...] According to Horn, {{these and other}} such [...] "failures {{may have been the}} result of producers simply relying on the label 'rock musical' to attract audiences without regard {{to the quality of the}} material presented." [...] Jesus Christ Superstar (1970) and Godspell (1971) were two religiously themed successes of the genre. [...] Grease (1971) reverted to the rock sounds of the 1950s, and black-themed musicals like The Wiz (1975) were heavily influenced by gospel, R and soul music. [...] By the late 1970s, the genre had played itself out. [...] Except for a few outposts of rock, like Dreamgirls (1981) and Little Shop of Horrors (1982), audience tastes in the 1980s turned to [...] with pop scores, like Les Misérables (1985) and The Phantom of the Opera (1986). [...] Some later rock musicals, such as Rent (1996) and Spring Awakening (2006), as well as jukebox musicals featuring rock music, like We Will Rock You (2002) and Rock of Ages (2009), have found success. [...] But the rock musical did not quickly come to dominate the musical theatre stage after Hair. [...] Critic Clive Barnes commented, [...] "There really weren't any rock musicals. [...] No major rock musician ever did a rock score for Broadway. ... You <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the musical Tommy, but it was never conceived as a Broadway show. ... And one can see why. [...] There's so much more money in records and rock concerts. [...] I mean, why bother going through the pain of a musical which may close in Philadelphia?" ...|$|E

"THAT {{was exactly}} like Robert,"--was his {{immediate}} observation.--"And THAT," [...] he presently added, [...] "might perhaps be in HIS head when the acquaintance between them first began.

2500|$|The Hellenistic city of Alexandria, founded 331 BCE, {{contained}} a large Jewish community which lived in peace with equivalently sized Greek and Egyptian populations.

2500|$|On another occasion, he explained: [...] "the {{line length}} ... you'll notice that they're all built on bop—you <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{them as a}} bop refrain—chorus after chorus after chorus—the ideal being, say, Lester Young in Kansas City in 1938, blowing 72 choruses of 'The Man I Love' until {{everyone}} in the hall {{was out of his}} head..." ...|$|E

2500|$|After playing five {{first class}} games and taking 17 wickets, Thomson was a {{surprise}} selection in for the second test against Pakistan.

[...] "I will try my guts out," [...] said Thomson. [...] "I was just hoping that I might pick up some more wickets in the forthcoming matches against Victoria so that they <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> me for the West Indies." ...|$|E
2500|$|During a 2008 interview, {{when asked}} if he had ever benefited from his parents' {{connection}} to the entertainment industry, Thicke answered, [...] "It never helped. It's always been a hindrance … People can't see me without seeing them, and it affects the way people see me … When you listen to Jay-Z's music, you don't see his mother and father standing there. You don't even think of his mother and father. But if you knew all of Jay-Z's family, you <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him differently.

2500|$|In 1889, Clarke went to Australia, {{where he}} succeeded Frederick Cowen as {{conductor}} of the Victorian National Orchestra in Melbourne. [...] He was also made inspector of Australian army bands, and given the honorary rank of Captain. He did not enjoy Melbourne; after returning to England in 1892, he gave a talk describing his experiences, giving [...] "many valuable hints … to those who <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> accepting appointments in the Australian Colonies". His comments drew a rejoinder from an Australian writer who accused him of [...] "incompetence and lack of interest" [...] while in Melbourne.|$|E
2500|$|Despite finding ruined watchtowers and {{fortification}} walls, Evans {{said that}} there was little evidence of ancient Minoan fortifications. According to Stylianos Alexiou (in Kretologia 8), a number of sites (especially early and middle Minoan sites such as Aghia Photia) are built on hilltops or otherwise fortified. Lucia Nixon wrote, [...] "We may have been over-influenced by the lack of what we <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> as solid fortifications to assess the archaeological evidence properly. As in so many other instances, we may not have been looking for evidence in the right places, and therefore we may not end with a correct assessment of the Minoans and their ability to avoid war." ...|$|E

If they came to 'help' you it was merely a straightforward re-enactment of what they had done initially. The only one who 'taught' in our western understanding was Koichi Tohei who had been to Hawaii and parts of the United States.
