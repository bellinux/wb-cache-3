40|$|Currently, the United States Supreme Court {{requires}} a fact-specific approach {{to determine whether}} a patent claim is eligible subject matter under 35 U. S. C. § 101, even though, traditionally, this has been considered a question of law. However, recently, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit introduced the “manifestly evident” standard. The court held that when it is not <b>manifestly</b> <b>evident</b> that a claim is directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea, then that claim must be deemed patent-eligible subject matter. This Comment suggests that the <b>manifestly</b> <b>evident</b> standard, or one similar to it, will reduce litigation costs. This is because, under the current fact-specific requirements, it may become commonplace for courts to engage in formal claim construction, a costly pre-trial process, to decide whether these requirements are met. But under the <b>manifestly</b> <b>evident</b> standard, courts and litigants will be able to quickly move past the often confusing section 101 to the later sections of the Patent Act, which courts are better prepared to confront...|$|R

60|$|The real {{difference}} between Paganism and Christianity is perfectly {{summed up in}} {{the difference between the}} pagan, or natural, virtues, and those three virtues of Christianity which the Church of Rome calls virtues of grace. The pagan, or rational, virtues are such things as justice and temperance, and Christianity has adopted them. The three mystical virtues which Christianity has not adopted, but invented, are faith, hope, and charity. Now much easy and foolish Christian rhetoric could easily be poured out upon those three words, but I desire to confine myself to the two <b>facts</b> which are <b>evident</b> about them. The first <b>evident</b> <b>fact</b> (in marked contrast to the delusion of the dancing pagan)--the first <b>evident</b> <b>fact,</b> I say, is that the pagan virtues, such as justice and temperance, are the sad virtues, and that the mystical virtues of faith, hope, and charity are the gay and exuberant virtues. And the second <b>evident</b> <b>fact,</b> which is even more <b>evident,</b> is the <b>fact</b> that the pagan virtues are the reasonable virtues, and that the Christian virtues of faith, hope, and charity are in their essence as unreasonable as they can be.|$|R

The latter is not {{necessarily}} limited to the ‘geometrical’ surface but may be more broadly classed as surface- or interface-induced defects to accommodate, for example, the effect of depletion regions at grain boundaries. Since the ZnO-NS here have a high surface area to volume ratio, it may be expected that surface defects {{play a significant role}} in the PL process. While defects of whichever type may not be detected directly with XRD, they can impart their signature to the Raman spectra but will be most <b>manifestly</b> <b>evident</b> in PL. The phenomenon of PL can thus provide both a useful means of characterisation of defects in ZnO and a pathway to exploitation as fluorescent coatings and markers.|$|R

40|$|The idea of {{collective}} robotics {{as an effective}} and robust approach to planetary explo-ration is an appealing one {{if for no other}} reason than the success so <b>manifestly</b> <b>evident</b> in the cooperative behaviour in the animal world such as in insect societies. Key to these societies is the lack of centralized control; that is, global behaviour emerges from local actions. One of the principal problems in realizing collective control in robotics is that of task decomposition. We present here a scalable architecture to facilitate emergent (self-organized) task decomposition using neural networks and evolutionary algorithms. We demonstrate the approach on a tiling (pattern formation) problem and show that bigger but more modular network architectures which exploit emergent task-decomposition strategies can evolve faster and outperform comparably smaller nonemergent neural networks...|$|R

Ear-lier this month in northeastern Bhutan, during the collection of blood sam-ples for the Bhutanese Genome Project, I was confronted with a sorely neglected portion of my field notes. My purpose here is to present some evidence for a statement written down in my field notes in the early 1990 s during the First Linguistic Survey of Bhutan. The claim is that Dzala and Dakpa appear to form a coherent subgroup within East Bodish. The inti-mate proximity of the relationship is <b>manifestly</b> <b>evident</b> {{in the form of the}} large amount of shared or nearly identical core vocabulary and is corrobo-rated by the intuitions of native speakers. East Bodish is part of Bodish, a well-defined branch within the Tibeto-Burman language family.

[...] Sheltered by this opinion, Mercier no longer hesitated to order the arrest of Dreyfus.
