25|$|The wombat's incisors {{resemble}} those of rodents, and its molars are widely spaced by the palate. The teeth keep growing for {{the entirety of the}} animal’s life, which is likely an adaptation to its harsh diet. Compared to the common wombat, the southern hairy-nosed wombat has a larger temporalis muscle and a smaller <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle.</b> Also, unlike the northern hairy-nosed wombat, the southern hairy-nosed wombat’s nasal bone is longer than the frontal bone.|$|E
25|$|Some bruxism {{activity}} is rhythmic with bite force pulses of tenths {{of a second}} (like chewing), and some have longer bite force pulses of 1 to 30 seconds (clenching). Some individuals clench without significant lateral movements. Bruxism can also {{be regarded as a}} disorder of repetitive, unconscious contraction of muscles. This typically involves the <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> and the anterior portion of the temporalis (the large outer muscles that clench), and the lateral pterygoids, relatively small bilateral muscles that act together to perform sideways grinding.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{evaluate}} the influence of oral contraceptive intake and menstrual cycle on the electrical activity and pressure pain threshold from anterior temporal and <b>masseter</b> <b>muscles.</b> Twenty-eight women on reproductive age were selected, 13 OC users and 15 nonusers. They were weekly submitted to electromyography and algometry of the anterior temporal and <b>masseter</b> <b>muscles</b> during three consecutive menstrual cycles. Electrical activities at rest position and PPTs of temporal and <b>masseter</b> <b>muscles</b> were not affected by menstrual cycle or by OCs uses. Comparison between groups demonstrated that working side electrical activity was increased in OC users in both muscles, except during lutheal phase for the anterior temporal. However, comparison within weeks did not demonstrate statistical difference.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} muscle fatigue in the temporal and <b>masseter</b> <b>muscles</b> in patients with temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD). Two hundred volunteers aged 19. 3 to 27. 8 years (mean 21. 50, SD 0. 97) participated in this study. Electromyographical (EMG) recordings were performed using a DAB-Bluetooth Instrument (Zebris Medical GmbH, Germany). Muscle fatigue was evaluated on the basis of a maximum effort test. The test was performed during a 10 -second maximum isometric contraction (MVC) of the jaws. An analysis of changes in the mean power frequency of the two pairs of temporal and <b>masseter</b> <b>muscles</b> (MPF%) revealed significant differences in the groups of patients with varying degrees of temporomandibular disorders according to Di (P< 0. 0000). The study showed an increase in the muscle fatigue of the temporal and <b>masseter</b> <b>muscles</b> correlated with the intensity of temporomandibular dysfunction symptoms in patients. The use of surface electromyography in assessing muscle fatigue is an excellent diagnostic tool for identifying patients with temporomandibular dysfunction...|$|R

2500|$|The {{earliest}} signs may include: <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> contracture following {{administration of}} succinylcholine, {{a rise in}} end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration (despite increased minute ventilation), unexplained tachycardia, and muscle rigidity. [...] Despite the name, elevation of body temperature is often a late sign, but may appear early in severe cases. Respiratory acidosis is universally present and many patients have developed metabolic acidosis {{at the time of}} diagnosis. A fast rate of breathing (in a spontaneously breathing patient), cyanosis, hypertension, abnormal heart rhythms, and high blood potassium may also be seen. Core body temperatures should be measured in any patient undergoing general anesthesia longer than 30 minutes.|$|E

40|$|Fatigue of {{striated}} muscles {{is defined}} as the impossibility to generate the expected or required force during the repeated contraction. During the maximal voluntary teeth contraction in the position of central occlusion the initial fatigue in masticatory muscles during the isometric contraction occurs. If a person can clench its teeth continuously and voluntarily it has a diagnostic significance since the peripheral fatigue is that important factor in the masticatory muscles activity, which is in direct correlation with the function of the masticatory system. The aim was to compare the obtained results of the initial fatigue of <b>masseter</b> <b>muscles</b> during the maximal voluntary teeth contraction in subjects with naturally healthy intact dentition and subjects with a pair of new full dentures. The investigation comprised 20 subjects with healthy stomatognathic system of the skeletal class I by Angle. Comparison of the values of the obtained results was performed electromyographically by synchronous registration of action potentials of <b>masseter</b> <b>muscles.</b> Results of the investigation of the onset of initial fatigue of <b>masseter</b> <b>muscles</b> in the subjects with natural healthy intact dentitions showed lower values, i. e., faster development of the muscular fatigue (31. 5 s) compared to the subjects with a pair of new full dentures (44. 5 s) ...|$|R
40|$|Mouth {{breathing}} {{has been}} associated with severe impact {{on the development of the}} stomatognathic system. Aim: This paper aims to analyze the electromyographical findings and patterns of electrical activity of the anterior temporal and <b>masseter</b> <b>muscles</b> in mouth and nasal breathing children. Materials And Method: The patients were divided into two groups: mouth breathers (n= 17) and nasal breathers (n= 12). The children underwent bilateral electromyographic examination of the anterior temporal and <b>masseter</b> <b>muscles</b> at maximal intercuspal position and during usual mastication. A Myosystem Br- 1 electromyograph with 12 acquisition channels, amplification with total gain of 5938, rate of acquisition of 4000 Hz, and band-pass filter of 20 - 1000 Hz, was used in the examination.

40|$|In {{a sample}} of fifteen {{partially}} edentulous subjects assigned for immediate complete denture treatment, a correlation analysis was performed between pre-extraction facial morphology determined from lateral cephalograms, and EMG activity of the anterior temporal and <b>masseter</b> <b>muscles</b> in maximal clench and tapping of teeth. Marked correlations observed between vertical and sagittal jaw relations and mean voltages of the jaw-closing muscles indicated strong biting activity in subjects with a square facial type. No significant associations were observed between biting strength {{and the age of}} the subjects. Correlations between facial morphological changes and changes in EMG biting activity after denture insertion and during 1 year of denture wear indicated that the anterior temporal muscles were extremely sensitive to sagittal changes in anterior occlusion. The <b>masseter</b> <b>muscles</b> were less sensitive, but responded in some instances to changes in vertical jaw relationship...|$|R

5000|$|The submasseterric space (also {{termed the}} masseteric space) is a fascial {{space of the}} head and neck (sometimes also termed fascial spaces or tissue spaces). It is a {{potential}} space in the face over the angle of the jaw, and is paired on each side. It is located between the lateral aspect of the mandible and the medial aspect of the <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> and its investing fascia. The term is derived from [...] meaning [...] "under" [...] in Latin and masseteric which refers to the <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle.</b> The submasseteric space is one of the four compartments of the masticator space. Sometimes the submasseteric space is described as a series of spaces, created because the <b>masseter</b> <b>muscle</b> has multiple insertions that cover most of the lateral surface of the ramus of the mandible.|$|E
