50|$|Manual {{transmissions}} often {{feature a}} driver-operated clutch and a <b>movable</b> <b>gear</b> stick. Most automobile manual transmissions allow {{the driver to}} select any forward gear ratio ("gear") at any time, but some, such as those commonly mounted on motorcycles and some types of racing cars, only allow the driver to select the next-higher or next-lower gear. This type of transmission is sometimes called a sequential manual transmission.|$|E
40|$|Although {{planetary}} gears {{used in an}} industrial region have load equalizing mechanisms in order to equalize distributed loads on planet gears each other, those mechanisms may be uneffective dynamically in some cases. In this report, the face bearing patterns, the load distributions on planet gears and the dynamic loads on a sun gear in some types of {{planetary gears}} have been measured by strain gages {{in order to obtain}} an easy method of improving the dynamic characteristics of planetary gears. The planetary gears used in the experiment are those with non-crowned planet gears, those with crowned planet gears and those with either the <b>movable</b> internal <b>gear</b> or the <b>movable</b> sun <b>gear.</b> Consequently results are as follows. Although using crowned planet gears is effective for decreasing the maximum fillet stress owing to improvement of the face bearing patterns, which is uneffective for both equalizing the distributed loads on planet gears each other and decreasing the dynamic load. On the other hand, moving either the internal gear or the sun gear, which is a comparatively easy method, is effective for both decreasing the maximum fillet stress and the dynamic load and equalizing the distributed loads on planet gears...|$|R
40|$|<b>Movable</b> pin-joints, <b>gears,</b> springs, cranks, and slider {{structures}} with dimensions {{measured in}} micrometers have been fabricated using silicon microfabrication technology. These micromechanical structures, which have important transducer applications, are batch-fabricated with an IC-compatible process. The movable mechanical elements {{are built on}} layers that are later removed {{so that they are}} freed for translation and rotation. An undercut-and-refill technique, which makes use of the high surface mobility of silicon atoms undergoing chemical vapor deposition, is used to refill undercut regions in order to form restraining flanges. Typical element sizes and masses are measured in micrometers and nanograms. The process provides the tiny structures in an assembled form avoiding the nearly impossible challenge of handling such small elements individually...|$|R
50|$|Historically the {{punishment}} for the usurpation of arms were severe. In Acts dated 1592 and 1672, the Court was given the full power to fine and imprison offenders. In 1669 the Court was given the power to issue letters of horning. As well as the full power: to erase unwarranted arms, to 'dash them furth of' stained-glass windows and to break unwarranted seals. Where the cases involve forfeiture, the Court could grant a warrant for the seizure of <b>movable</b> goods and <b>gear</b> where unwarranted arms are found.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Langley V/STOL tunnel to determine the static longitudinal and lateral-directional aerodynamic characteristics of an advanced high-aspect-ratio supercritical-wing transport model equipped with a full-span leading-edge slat and part-span double-slotted trailing-edge flaps. This wide-body transport model was also equipped with spoiler and aileron control surfaces, flow-through nacelles, landing <b>gear,</b> <b>movable</b> horizontal tails, and interchangeable wing tips with aspect ratios of 10 and 12. The model was tested with leading-edge slat and trailing-edge flap combinations representative of cruise, climb, takeoff, and landing wing configurations. The tests were conducted at free-stream conditions corresponding to Reynolds numbers (based on mean geometric chord) of 0. 97 to 1. 63 x 10 to the 6 th power and corresponding Mach numbers of 0. 12 to 0. 20, through an angle-of-attack range of - 2 deg to 24 deg and a sideslip-angle range of - 10 deg to 5 deg...|$|R
60|$|Strong {{waters and}} {{essences}} were busily employed {{to recall the}} senses of the unfortunate captive; and, when his first faint gasps intimated a return of sensation, the Duke pronounced sentence of death upon him, as a traitor taken {{in the act of}} open rebellion, and adjudged him to be carried from the bar to the common place of execution, and there hanged by the neck; his head and hands to be stricken off after death, and disposed of according to the pleasure of the Council, [Note: The pleasure of the Council respecting the relics of their victims was often as savage as the rest of their conduct. The heads of the preachers were frequently exposed on pikes between their two hands, the palms displayed as in the attitude of prayer. When the celebrated Richard Cameron's head was exposed in this manner, a spectator bore testimony to it as that of one who lived praying and preaching, and died praying and fighting.] and all and sundry his <b>movable</b> goods and <b>gear</b> escheat and inbrought to his Majesty's use.|$|R
