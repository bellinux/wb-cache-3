40|$|Size-based <b>ecosystem</b> <b>modeling</b> is {{emerging}} as a powerful way to assess ecosystem-level impacts of human- and environment-driven changes from individual-level processes. These models have evolved as mechanistic explanations for observed regular patterns of abundance across the marine size spectrum hypothesized to hold from bacteria to whales. Fifty years since the first size spectrum measurements, we ask how far have we come? Although recent modeling studies capture an impressive range of sizes, complexity, and real-world applications, ecosystem coverage is still only partial. We describe how this can be overcome by unifying functional traits with size spectra (which we call functional size spectra) and highlight the key knowledge gaps {{that need to be}} filled to <b>model</b> <b>ecosystems</b> from bacteria to whales.

5000|$|Blue Shift 1 (2001): ‘Blue Shift’ is an {{interactive}} art installation, made for Art Center STUK in Leuven (Belgium). This Darwinian installation piece was realized together with evolutionary biologist Prof. Luc De Meester from the University of Leuven (Belgium) and engineers from electronics company Philips (Turnhout, Belgium). The project was originally conceived {{for the exhibition}} 'Hot Re-Strike' (curated by Stef Van Bellingen) at De Warande arts centre in Turnhout (Belgium) in 2005. Blue Shift (LOG.1) is {{an interactive}} art installation with a living <b>model</b> <b>ecosystem</b> at its core. Using single-cell algae, water fleas, fish and water snails, a compact aquatic community is {{set up in the}} exhibition space. The whole system is designed {{in such a way that}} visitors drastically induce a gradual microevolution of the - genetically determined - light-responsive behavior of the water fleas. When the system is in standby, yellow lights illuminate the aquaria from the top. The water fleas are strongly attracted to this light and swim near the surface of the water. Whenever a visitor approaches the installation and passes a wall-mounted sensor, blue spotlights on top of the aquaria are activated. The water fleas are repelled by this color of light, flee downwards and pass through holes in a false bottom of the aquaria. However, fish are residing in the lower sections of the aquaria and most of the water fleas are immediately wiped out. What can be considered to be a survival strategy in natural circumstances - blue light indicates clear open water and hence potential detection by fish - has quite a different meaning in this set up: it are exactly those water fleas which do not swim away from the blue light, that survive and reproduce. In this way, their genes will become dominant in the water flea populations and a 'contra-natural' selection will occur. When the work is on display, the artists-scientists continuously adjust the set-up and carry out new experiments. The installation aims to question the status of the utilitarian in art and science, and push interactive installation art into Darwinian realms.|$|E

40|$|Questions: Does {{diversity}} beget {{stability in}} ecosystems? What are {{the limits of}} mathematical modelling to understand this question? What is the dynamical behaviour of a <b>model</b> <b>ecosystem</b> that describes the effect of ‘not putting all one’s eggs into one basket’? Methods: Mathematical models {{have been used to}} determine whether diversity begets stability in ecosystems. Experience of the use of mathematics in the management of fisheries helps us to understand the limits in using mathematics to describe biological populations and to answer this ecological question. I use some properties of dynamical systems in control theory to study the effects of ‘not putting all one’s eggs into one basket ’ in a <b>model</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> Conclusions: To better understand the issue of biodiversity and stability more research is required. First, there are many concepts of stability in model ecosystems and they do not define fully the stability of real ecosystems. Second, for a species with very high fecundity, for example the Asian silver carp, the Beverton-Holt approach does not even try to use mathematics to model the first stage of the dynamics of a year-class in the fish population. Thus, conclusions from an analysis of a <b>model</b> <b>ecosystem</b> may have limited applications to real ecosystems. I studied a linear model of a large ecosystem with many null interactions and showed that just a single disturbance can adversely affect each and every species or component of the <b>model</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> Thus to be invulnerable to continuous disturbances, an ecosystem requires subtle patterns of interactions among the species and between the species and the environment...|$|E

Fate and threshold values were subsequently compared with those noted in temperate <b>model</b> <b>ecosystem</b> studies in order to evaluate to which extent toxicity data generated in temperate regions for compounds like carbendazim may be extrapolated to tropical areas. Carbendazim disappeared faster from the water column than reported in temperate <b>model</b> <b>ecosystem</b> studies, which is explained by a possibly greater microbial breakdown of the fungicide under the tropical conditions tested. The No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC) calculated in the present study for the macroinvertebrate community was the same as recorded in a study carried out in The Netherlands (3. 3 µg L- 1). However, most sensitive representatives in the latter study were “worm-like” taxa, whereas water boatmen (Corixidae) were the most sensitive macroinvertebrates in the present study. The ecological realism of a tropical risk assessment based on temperate organisms that are less sensitive than local macroinvertebrates may be questionable.
