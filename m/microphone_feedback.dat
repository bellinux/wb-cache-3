After these albums, though, the direction changed again and Jandek returned to a voice and guitar mixture with occasional harmonica, though the approach was different than the earlier recordings. The guitar was often electric and the voice was decidedly older than that on the previous albums. Further albums have continued the solo approach, though the instrument used has occasionally been a fretless bass, and the songs have stretched progressively longer and the lyrics have become even more personal. Though Corwood still releases albums like this (the most recent is What Was Out There Disappeared), they are now alternated with releases of the live band shows, which are remarkably different and feature unusually tight playing.

30|$|Applications of gain-constrained {{adaptive}} systems include {{systems that}} use a <b>microphone</b> for <b>feedback,</b> {{and due to}} the acoustic path to the microphone notches or peaks occur in the microphone frequency response (which may not be present in other locations).

Applications of power-constrained adaptive systems include requirements to limit the maximum power delivered to S(z) to a predetermined constraint value to prevent overdriving the transducer, prevent output amplifier saturation, or prevent other nonlinear behavior [4]. The primary difference between these implementations is that the gain-constrained algorithm does not take the input power into account when determining the constraint violation.|$|R

The use of interactive elements, like navigation in static sound fields, {{has proven to}} be very significant in order to better integrate the listener with the simulated soundscape.

Enabling the subject to act as a sound source and allowing communication within the environment, utilizing real-time synthesis of an acoustic environment's response. Auralization allows for a psychoacoustic evaluation of the acoustical space and therefore plays an important part in a wider understanding of different environmental characteristics. With an auralization framework adapting this kind of interaction, experience of the acoustical response is enabled and can thus be used as a tool in the process of subjectively assessing the acoustical space. Real-time convolution software implementing this mode of procedure has been designed. A subjective evaluation has been performed using a listening room equipped with an ambisonics multi-channel reproduction system, and a directional <b>microphone</b> with <b>feedback</b> control.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{adaptive}} algorithm for the combined acoustic feedback and noise cancellation in the binaural hearing aids. The proposed algorithm {{is based on}} dual <b>microphones</b> for <b>feedback</b> cancellation and the beamforming method for noise cancellation. The coefficients of feedback canceller are updated after subtracting the speech signal from the input signal by dual microphones. And the noise canceller reduces the noise signal in the residual signal excluding the speech by the beamforming method. Firstly, the feedback canceller operates to cancel the feedback signal in the microphone signal, and then the noise canceller operates to reduce the noise in the residual signal. Also, to assure the stable convergence of binaural hearing aids in the training mode, the coefficients of the left hearing aid are firstly updated, then the coefficients of the right hearing aid are updated. In the normal mode, the feedback and the noise canceller are operated without updating coefficients except an unstable case. To verify performances of the proposed algorithm, we analyzed its convergence behavior and simulated for real speech. From the results of simulations, it was proved that we can advance 14. 43 dB SFR(speech-to-feedback ratio) on average in the feedback canceller, 10. 19 dB SNR(speech-to-noise ratio) improvement on average in the noise canceller, {{in the case of}} applying the proposed algorithm...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} {{component of}} the interior noise of aircraft and automobiles {{is a result of}} turbulent boundary layer excitation of the vehicular structure. In this work, active robust feedback control of the noise due to this non-predictable excitation is investigated. ^ Both an analytical model and experimental investigations are used to determine the characteristics of the flow induced structural sound radiation problem. The problem is shown to be broadband in nature with large system uncertainties associated with the various operating conditions. Furthermore the delay associated with sound propagation is shown to restrict the use of <b>microphone</b> <b>feedback.</b> The state of the art control methodologies, μ synthesis and adaptive feedback control, are evaluated and shown to have limited success for solving this problem. ^ A robust frequency domain controller design methodology is developed for the problem of sound radiated from turbulent flow driven plates. The control design methodology uses frequency domain sequential loop shaping techniques. System uncertainty, sound pressure level reduction performance, and actuator constraints are included in the design process. Using this design method, phase lag was added using non-minimum phase zeros such that the beneficial plant dynamics could be used. This general control approach has application to lightly damped vibration and sound radiation problems where there are high bandwidth control objectives requiring a low controller DC gain and controller order. ^ The controller design methodology developed in this work was verified experimentally. A multiple-input-multiple-output controller using accelerometer feedback and shaker control was able to achieve robust control up to 1000 Hz. Sound pressure level reductions of as much as 15 dB were achieved at multiple microphone locations. Overall reductions over the 100 - 1000 Hz band were approximately 5 dB. The controller was found to be robust to large changes in the system parameters due to speed variations from 35. 8 m/s to 51. 5 m/s and changes in the plate mass up to 40 percent. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the active control of road noise in vehicles, using either multichannel feedback control, with both headrest and floor positioned <b>microphones</b> providing <b>feedback</b> error signals, or multichannel feedforward control, in which reference signals {{are provided by}} the microphones on the vehicle floor and error signals are provided by the microphones mounted on the headrests. The formulation of these control problems is shown to be similar if the constraints of robust stability, limited disturbance enhancement and open-loop stability are imposed. A novel formulation is presented for disturbance enhancement in multichannel systems, which limits the maximum enhancement of each individual error signal. The performance of these two systems is predicted using plant responses and disturbance signals measured in a small city car. The reduction in {{the sum of the}} squared pressure signals at the four error microphones for both systems is found to be up to 8 dB at low frequencies and 3 dB on average, where the sound level is particularly high from 80 to 180 Hz. The performance of both systems is found to be robust to measured variations in the plant responses. The enhancements in the disturbance at higher frequencies are smaller for the feedback controller than for the feedforward controller, although the performance of the feedback controller is more significantly reduced by the introduction of additional delay in the plant response. <br/...|$|R
50|$|A noise-cancellation speaker may be {{co-located}} {{with the}} sound source to be attenuated. In this case it must have the same audio power level {{as the source of}} the unwanted sound. Alternatively, the transducer emitting the cancellation signal may be located at the location where sound attenuation is wanted (e.g. the user's ear). This requires a much lower power level for cancellation but is effective only for a single user. Noise cancellation at other locations is more difficult as the three-dimensional wavefronts of the unwanted sound and the cancellation signal could match and create alternating zones of constructive and destructive interference, reducing noise in some spots while doubling noise in others. In small enclosed spaces (e.g. the passenger compartment of a car) global noise reduction can be achieved via multiple speakers and <b>feedback</b> <b>microphones,</b> and measurement of the modal responses of the enclosure.|$|R

40|$|Analog-to-digital {{converters}} play {{a crucial}} role in modern audio and communication design. Conventional Nyquist converters are suitable only for medium resolutions and require analog components that are precise and highly immune to noise and interference. In contrast, oversampling converters can achieve high resolutions (> 20 bits) and can be implemented using straightforward, high-tolerance analog components. In conventional oversampled modulators, negative feedback is applied in order to control the dynamic behavior of a system and to realize the attenuation of the quantization noise in the signal band due to noise shaping. However, feedback can also introduce undesirable effects such as limit cycles, jitter problems in continuous-time topologies, and infinite impulse responses. Additionally, it increases the system complexity due to extra circuit components such as nonlinear multi-bit digital-to-analog converters in the feedback path. Moreover, in certain applications such as wireless, biomedical sensory, or <b>microphone</b> implementations <b>feedback</b> cannot be applied. As a result, the main goal of this thesis is to develop sigma-delta data converters without feedback. Various new delta-sigma analog-to-digital converter topologies are explored their mathematical models are presented. Simulations are carried out to validate these models and to show performance results. Specifically, two topologies, a first-order and a second-order oscillator-based delta-sigma modulator without feedback are described in detail. They both can be implemented utilizing VCOs and standard digital gates, thus requiring only few components. As proof of concept, two digital microphones based on these delta-sigma converters without feedback were implemented and experimental results are given. These results show adequate performance and provide a new approach of measuring. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|In {{many kinds}} of buildings, the {{ventilation}} is handled by a mechanical ventilation system. Such ventilation systems constitute a well known source of broadband noise. As awareness of the negative effects that subjection to low frequency noise can have on human well-being has increased, so too has the requirement for quieter ventilation installations. Traditionally, duct born noise is attenuated using passive resistive silencers. These passive silencers are valued {{for their ability to}} produce a high level of attenuation over a broad frequency range, however they tend to become large and bulky if designed for low frequency attenuation. The active noise control (ANC) technique is known for its ability to produce high levels of attenuation in the low frequency range even with a relatively moderate sized ANC system. On the other hand, ANC normally tends to be ineffective for higher frequencies. Accordingly, a combination of active- and passive techniques, i. e. the construction of a hybrid active/passive silencer, provides a duct silencer solution of manageable size which also covers the low frequency range. The ANC systems controller normally relies on adaptive digital signal processing. Even so, adequate levels of attenuation {{are not likely to be}} obtained if the installation of the ANC system is not designed to account for the physical factors that may degrade its performance. This thesis focuses on applying ANC in ventilation systems, with particular emphasis on analysis and installation design, for the purpose of reducing the influence of some of these degrading physical factors. The degrading factors which are of particular interest include: flow induced noise in the <b>microphone</b> signals, acoustic <b>feedback</b> between the control loudspeaker and reference microphone, and standing waves inside the ducts. With respect to installation design, focus is also placed upon industry requests on the ANC system. Taking this into consideration has led to a module based approach, in which the microphones and the loudspeaker are installed in separate modules based on standard duct parts. This thesis comprises four parts. The first describes initial investigations of potential microphone installations intended to reduce flow induced noise. The second part analyzes the influence of flow induced noise on the digital controller and presents further investigations of microphone modules. Further, results of measurements conducted in an acoustic laboratory according to an ISO-standard are presented. The attenuation produced by the ANC system was approximately 15 - 25 dB between 50 - 315 Hz even for airflow speeds up to 20 m/s. The third part of this thesis focuses on the possibility of using the passive silencer with which the ANC system is combined, to reduce acoustic feedback and standing waves. The fourth and final part investigates the possibility of using a passive silencer to reduce standing waves in the duct when the ANC system is not installed near the duct outlet...|$|R
