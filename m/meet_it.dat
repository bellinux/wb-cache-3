5|$|Although the {{essential}} problem of large tribal {{groups on the}} frontier remained {{much the same as}} the situation Rome faced in earlier centuries, the 3rd century saw a marked increase in the overall threat, although there is disagreement over whether external pressure increased, or Rome's ability to <b>meet</b> <b>it</b> declined. The Carpi and Sarmatians whom Rome had held at bay were replaced by the Goths and likewise the Quadi and Marcomanni that Rome had defeated were replaced by the greater confederation of the Alamanni.|$|E
5|$|Ricketts Glen is {{the name}} given to the Kitchen Creek valley south and {{downstream}} of Waters <b>Meet.</b> <b>It</b> is 1.8miles (2.9km) between Pennsylvania Route 118 and Waters Meet on the Falls Trail, making this the longest glen. The three northernmost waterfalls are all within 0.5miles (0.80km) of Waters Meet, and are only a short hike {{from the bottom of}} Ganoga Glen or Glen Leigh. The southern part of this glen has large areas of old-growth forest, chiefly hemlocks. Ricketts Glen is entirely in the Catskill Formation and all of the falls on this section of Kitchen Creek have plunge pools.|$|E
5|$|Seymour Cray {{began the}} design of the Cray-3 in 1985, as soon as the Cray-2 reached production. Cray {{generally}} set himself the goal of producing new machines with ten times the performance of the previous models. Although the machines did not always meet this goal, this was a useful technique in defining the project and clarifying what sort of process improvements would be needed to <b>meet</b> <b>it.</b> For the Cray-3, he decided to set an even higher performance improvement goal, an increase of 12x over the Cray-2.|$|E

A parabola <b>meets</b> <b>it</b> at only one point, but it is a point of tangency and therefore counts twice.|$|R

5|$|After the Ashton Canal {{closed in}} the 1960s, {{it was decided to}} turn the Portland Basin {{warehouse}} into a museum. In 1985, {{the first part of the}} Heritage Centre and Museum opened on the first floor of the warehouse. The restoration of building was complete in 1999; the museum details Tameside's social, industrial, and political history. The basin next to the warehouse is the point at which the Ashton Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Peak Forest Canal <b>meet.</b> <b>It</b> has been used several times as a filming location for Coronation Street, including a scene where the character Richard Hillman drove into the canal.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated in {{his efforts}} to {{intercept}} the convoy at anchor, Willaumez determined to <b>meet</b> <b>it</b> at sea, sailing to the Bahama Banks. There he waited for the convoy, seizing any ships that came within sight of his squadron, including neutral vessels, in case they revealed his position. For several weeks Willaumez's lookouts saw nothing, the British holding the convoy back until they obtained some information about the location of the French squadron. During the night of 31 July, bored with waiting for the convoy, Captain Jérôme Bonaparte sailed northwards away from the squadron, acting without orders or even notifying his admiral. When dawn broke on 1 August, Willaumez was panicked by the disappearance of Vétéran and, assuming that the ship had somehow been accidentally separated, began to search for the missing vessel and its important commander.|$|E
5|$|This {{major change}} from a Classical design to a far more complex revival style, little known in Russia, meant Vorontsov had to find an {{alternative}} architect to execute a new design. This was further complicated by Vorontsov's desire to not only have a loose Jacobean style, but also to incorporate motifs from Islamic architecture so as to highlight the oriental strain evident in the Khan's Palace, Enikale Fort, and other local Tatar architecture. The resulting design was to highlight the Crimea's position {{as a place where}} the East and West <b>meet.</b> <b>It</b> was a radical departure from the Neoclassical strain that dominated the Russian architecture of the period.|$|E

5|$|Traffic levels {{increased}} substantially on the Portway {{when the}} M5 motorway was extended past Cribbs Causeway to <b>meet</b> <b>it</b> in 1971, as {{it provided a}} convenient way of avoiding the congested road network around north-west Bristol. Although this was only {{intended to be a}} stopgap measure until the Avonmouth Bridge was completed, construction of the bridge was repeatedly delayed. Transport Minister Keith Speed proposed a temporary solution of signing all Midlands – South West traffic via the Portway, followed by either the A369 from Bristol to Portishead northbound, or local roads southbound. The scheme required minor upgrading to junctions along the Portway. The Avonmouth Bridge opened in May 1974, making the scheme redundant.|$|E
5|$|In a California forest, a {{group of}} alien botanists land in a spacecraft, {{collecting}} flora samples. When government agents appear on the scene, the aliens flee in their spaceship, leaving {{one of their own}} behind in their haste. At a suburban home, a ten-year-old boy named Elliott is spending time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves Reese's Pieces candy to lure the alien to his house. Before going to sleep, Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, <b>meet</b> <b>it.</b> They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary. When they ask it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its solar system and then demonstrates its powers by reviving dead chrysanthemums.|$|E

25|$|The courses {{reported}} by both submarines were incorrect, because they reflected one {{leg of a}} zigzag being used by British ships to avoid submarines.

25|$|The tariff {{issue was}} pulling the GOP apart. Roosevelt tried to {{postpone}} the issue, but Taft had to <b>meet</b> <b>it</b> head on in 1909 with the Payne–Aldrich Tariff Act.

Aldrich tricked them by lowering the tariff on farm products, which outraged the farmers. Insurgent Midwesterners led by George Norris revolted against the conservatives led by Speaker Cannon. The Democrats won control of the House in 1910 as the rift between insurgents and conservatives widened.|$|E

Already in turmoil over the Brown raid, Southerners were further aggravated by the nomination of Ohio Republican John Sherman for the post. Sherman was one of 68 Republicans who had endorsed Hinton Helper’s book, The Impending Crisis and How to <b>Meet</b> <b>It,</b> which Southerners believed would ignite class warfare between slaveholders and non-slaveholders in the South. Republicans proposed buying 100,000 copies of the book and distributing it throughout the country.
