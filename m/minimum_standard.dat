40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the consequences of}} imposing binding <b>minimum</b> <b>standards</b> {{on the market for}} voluntary private health insurance for the elderly. Theoretically, the effect of these standards on insurance coverage and on welfare is ambiguous. I find robust evidence of a substantial decline in insurance associated with the <b>minimum</b> <b>standards.</b> The central estimates suggest that the standards are associated with an 8 percentage point (25 percent) decrease in the proportion of the population with coverage in the affected market; I find no evidence of substitution to other, unregulated sources of insurance coverage. Additional evidence suggests that the <b>minimum</b> <b>standards</b> are also associated with reduced coverage of non-mandated benefits among the insured. The empirical results are most consistent with a model of the effect of <b>minimum</b> <b>standards</b> on insurance markets with adverse selection, and suggest that adverse selection exacerbates the potential for unintended negative consequences of <b>minimum</b> <b>standards.</b> The final section of the paper considers the welfare implications of the changes in risk bearing associated with the <b>minimum</b> <b>standards.</b> The results suggest that the imposition of these standards was, even under relatively conservative assumptions, welfare reducing on net. ...|$|R

40|$|We study firms' {{responses}} to <b>minimum</b> <b>standards</b> {{and other forms}} of regulatory intervention on both the probability of exit and the distribution of observable product quality, using firm level data for a nationally representative sample of markets. Our empirical work is motivated by the literature on quality and price competition in the presence of <b>minimum</b> <b>standards.</b> We find that <b>minimum</b> <b>standards</b> increase the probability that firms exit certain markets. Moreover, we find that exit can cause both the average and the maximum quality observed in the market to decline. This perverse regulatory effect occurs when excessively high standards cause high quality firms to exit. When <b>minimum</b> <b>standards</b> do not lead to exit, <b>minimum</b> <b>standards</b> can increase the average and maximum quality of products in the market. Such standards can not only force low quality firms to raise their quality, but may cause high quality firms to increase quality, presumably in an attempt to alleviate price competition and differentiate themselves from their now higher quality rivals. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} fair <b>minimum</b> <b>standards</b> is {{essential}} to enable workers to be justly rewarded for their work, to ensure fairness across the labour market (especially for vulnerable workers) and to enable employees to live a fulfilling life and attain a fair balance between work {{and the rest of}} their lives. This chapter addresses these standards. Bearing in mind the experience of the past two decades, it is useful to conceptualise appropriate <b>minimum</b> <b>standards</b> as falling into the following three categories: 剩rreducible <b>minimum</b> <b>standards</b> - substantive standards below which workers cannot fall 剣ompensable <b>minimum</b> <b>standards</b> - substantive standards below which workers generally cannot fall but where deviations can be allowed in certain circumstances, which must include that workers are generously compensated for such deviations 剦acilitative <b>minimum</b> <b>standards</b> - standards that set out procedural rather than substantive rights that are designed to enable workers to attain a fair balance between work and the rest of their lives. Australia's work and care regime is shaped in significant ways by the irreducible <b>minimum</b> <b>standards,</b> compensable <b>minimum</b> <b>standards</b> and facilitative rights it puts in place. These have not kept pace with the workforce of the new century. They are certainly inadequate to this current workforce - one that is facing a diminishing labour supply arising from domestic demographic changes and restricted prospects of labour supply through skilled immigration. Patterns of <b>minimum</b> <b>standards</b> need not and should not be frozen in time: they must both lead and respond to change. As living standards rise, workers' social circumstances evolve, the gender composition and care responsibilities of the workforce change and the pressures on workers shift, <b>minimum</b> <b>standards</b> must adapt. Fairly constructed industrial tribunals, with high levels of legitimacy in the community, have the ongoing ability to establish new national standards in the future, where circumstances warrant, that reflect the needs and capacity of society as it evolves, ensuring that industrial standards facilitate change with equity.
