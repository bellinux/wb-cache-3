5|$|Alive or Just Breathing {{was mixed}} in February 2002 at Backstage Productions in Ripley, Derbyshire, UK by Andy Sneap. Dutkiewicz brought the album to the UK and oversaw the <b>mixing</b> <b>process.</b> The band chose Sneap after hearing {{good things about}} his work. The band and label were both {{very pleased with the}} mix, and Dutkiewicz in {{particular}} noted his satisfaction with the drum tones.|$|E
5|$|The band {{initially}} {{planned to}} record their debut album {{in the space of}} two weeks. However, tours and other live performances caused the recording to spread out between September 1999 and April–May 2000. The album was recorded at Rockfield Studios, Matrix Studios, and Wessex Sound Studios with producer Ken Nelson, although the majority of Parachutes' tracks were recorded at Liverpool's Parr Street Studios (where they accessed three studio rooms). The <b>mixing</b> <b>process</b> on all songs for the album was done by American engineer Michael Brauer in New York. During that period, they played on the Carling Tour, which showcased up-and-coming acts.|$|E

5|$|The band {{recorded}} …And Justice for All {{during early}} 1988 at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Musically, {{the album is}} progressive, with long and complex songs, fast tempos, and few verse-chorus structures. It is noted for its sterile production, which producer Flemming Rasmussen attributed to his absence during the <b>mixing</b> <b>process.</b> The lyrics feature themes of political and legal injustice seen through the prisms of censorship, war, and nuclear brinkmanship.|$|E
5|$|The band {{wanted to}} expand on the {{commercial}} success of the 1975 album Fleetwood Mac, but struggled with relationship breakups before recording started. The Rumours studio sessions were marked by hedonistic behaviour and interpersonal strife among Fleetwood Mac members; these experiences shaped the album's lyrics. Influenced by pop music, the record's tracks were recorded {{using a combination of}} acoustic and electric instruments. The <b>mixing</b> <b>process</b> delayed the completion of Rumours, but was finished by the end of 1976. Following the album's release in 1977, Fleetwood Mac undertook worldwide promotional tours.|$|E
5|$|The band {{aimed for}} a tribal sound but {{encountered}} problems including minuscule timing errors; during this period, they refined their percussive sound by experimenting with erecting walls {{to isolate the}} drums and rearranging parts. In February 1996, during the <b>mixing</b> <b>process,</b> guitarist Donnie Steele {{decided to leave the}} band for religious reasons and as a result, Craig Jones joined the band to fill the spot; however, the band realized that they were incorporating too many samples on their recordings and could not reproduce these sounds live. To solve this problem, Jones moved to full-time sampler and Mick Thomson joined as a guitarist. Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. was released on October 31, 1996 with a release party at The Safari, a local club where the band played many of their earliest gigs.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the random {{central limit theorem}} (CLT) for a linear process of which the error <b>process</b> is strong <b>mixing</b> with the associated mixing order satisfying certain regularity conditions. By using the moment inequality of Yokoyama (1980, Corollary 1) we prove that the random CLT holds for the error process, which is a generalization of Réyni (1960) on iid random variables. Based on this result and applying the Beveridge and Nelson decomposition of the linear process (cf. Phillips and Solo, 1993), the random CLT is established for the linear process generated by strong <b>mixing</b> <b>processes.</b> Random central limit theorem Linear processes generated by strong <b>mixing</b> <b>processes</b> The Beveridge and Nelson decomposition Moment bounds for strong <b>mixing</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R
25|$|Mixing the {{semolina}} {{and water}} {{takes place in}} two stages. First, the ingredients are measured and added to a pre-mixer, and then they are transferred to a mixing chamber which finalizes the <b>mixing</b> <b>process</b> and produces a homogeneous mass.|$|E

25|$|The orchestral line-up {{featured}} 66 {{members from}} the London Philharmonic Orchestra, 32 singers from The Metro Voices and twelve gospel singers.

40|$|In {{chemical}} and pharmaceutical industry {{as well as}} in wastewater treatment and biogas production, the qualification and quantification of <b>mixing</b> <b>processes</b> is a crucial requirement for process engineering and energetic optimization. The analysis of <b>mixing</b> <b>processes</b> in stirred systems becomes a challenging task, especially when using opaque substrates. With electrical resistance tomography (ERT), a powerful technique is provided to allow a comprehensive and non-intrusive quantification of <b>mixing</b> <b>processes</b> of complex suspensions. Combined with advanced cross-correlation techniques, ERT offers the possibility to derive the axial flow velocity profile inside a stirred system. Investigations in different scales are an essential prerequisite regarding the evaluation and optimization of large-scale <b>mixing</b> <b>processes</b> under consideration of similarity laws. The validity of scale-up methods was ensured by comparable flow conditions and velocity distributions between the lab and pilot plant scale. For biogas plants, as an example for the importance of efficient mixing, the scale-up principles ‘geometric similarity’, ‘constant impeller tip speed’, ‘similar viscosity and flow characteristics’ as well as ‘scale-up of particles and fibers of the dispersed phase’ are proved to be valid by Fraunhofer IKTS. Within the scope of further investigations, reliable information related with CFD are ought to be derived for the continuing evaluation of <b>mixing</b> <b>processes</b> at any scale to establish a foundation for the dimensioning and operation of stirring systems, especially for highly concentrated, non-Newtonian fluids...|$|R

40|$|A {{scheme for}} the {{detection}} of photons generated by vacuum <b>mixing</b> <b>processes</b> is proposed. The strategy consists in the utilization of a high numerical aperture parabolic mirror which tightly focuses two co-propagating laser beams with different frequencies.

The field at the focus is obtained from the Stratton-Chu vector diffraction theory, which can accomodate any configuration of an incoming laser beam. The number of photons generated is evaluated for an incident radially polarized beam.

25|$|In February 1997, Antestor {{recorded}} a promo-CD titled Kongsblod at Studio 5, Oslo. The recording and <b>mixing</b> <b>process</b> took approximately 90 hours. At the time their line up consisted of guitarist/keyboardist Lars Stokstad (Vemod), vocalist/lyricist Kjetil Molnes (Martyr), bass player Vegard Undal and drummer Svein Sander (Armoth). The band sent Kongsblod to record labels {{in hopes of}} getting finances to record and mix at a better quality studio. The cover of the demo contains a famous Norwegian painting of skiing Vikings (Birkebeinerne, by Knud Bergslien). One of the biggest exclusively black metal focused British labels, Cacophonous Records, {{became interested in the}} band, and a record deal was signed with Antestor. However, Cacophonous simply released Kongsblod after changing the cover to a painting by the American fantasy artist Joe Petagno, and the name was changed to The Return of the Black Death. The album was released on September 14, 1998.|$|E
25|$|First, {{gum base}} is {{previously}} prepared through a melting and straining or filtering process. The formulation for gum base is proprietary information known to few individuals within each gum-producing company. Next, other ingredients such as nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners and flavors {{are added to}} the gum base until the warm mixture thickens like dough. The gum base mixture is heated during this <b>mixing</b> <b>process</b> in order to increase the entropy of the polymers to achieve a more uniform dispersion of ingredients. Then, extrusion technology is implemented to smooth, form, and shape the gum. Next, the gum goes through a shaping process that is determined by gum type and consumer demand. For example, cut and wrap (chunk or cube) pieces are severed straight out of the extruder using a vertical cutter. Sheeting is a technique often used for stick, slab and tab gums. Next, gum is either conditioned by being sprinkled with a powdered polyol or coated via the application of subsequent layers of coating using temperature controlled coating basins before it is sent to packaging.|$|E
