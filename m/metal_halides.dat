5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{are among the}} most {{electropositive}} elements on the periodic table and thus tend to bond ionically to the most electronegative elements on the periodic table, the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine), forming salts known as the alkali <b>metal</b> <b>halides.</b> The reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions. All twenty stable alkali <b>metal</b> <b>halides</b> are known; the unstable ones are not known, with the exception of sodium astatide, because of the great instability and rarity of astatine and francium. The most well-known of the twenty is certainly sodium chloride, otherwise known as common salt. All of the stable alkali <b>metal</b> <b>halides</b> have the formula MX where M is an alkali metal and X is a halogen. They are all white ionic crystalline solids that have high melting points. All the alkali <b>metal</b> <b>halides</b> are soluble in water except for lithium fluoride (LiF), which is insoluble in water due to its very high lattice enthalpy. The high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the Li+ and Fâˆ’ ions, causing the electrostatic interactions between them to be strong: a similar effect occurs for magnesium fluoride, consistent with the diagonal relationship between lithium and magnesium.|$|E

5|$|TiCl4 is a dense, {{colourless}} distillable liquid, although crude samples may be {{yellow or}} even red-brown. It {{is one of}} the rare transition <b>metal</b> <b>halides</b> that is a liquid at room temperature, VCl4 being another example. This property reflects the fact that TiCl4 is molecular; that is, each TiCl4 molecule is relatively weakly associated with its neighbours. Most metal chlorides are polymers, wherein the chloride atoms bridge between the metals. The attraction between the individual TiCl4 molecules is weak, primarily van der Waals forces, and these weak interactions result in low melting and boiling points, similar to those of CCl4.|$|E
5|$|While at high school, Levi {{decided that}} she would become a scientist. Her final year was devoted to a physics project on spectra and photography, which became her Oberreal Abiturium. She was the only girl in her class to major in physics that year. After her {{graduation}} in April 1928, her father sent her to England for six months to learn English and good manners. She entered the University of Munich in 1929, where she listened to lectures by Arnold Sommerfeld. For her doctorate, her father managed to get her accepted into the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry at Berlin-Dahlem, where she wrote her thesis on the spectra of alkali <b>metal</b> <b>halides,</b> {{under the supervision of}} Peter Pringsheim and Fritz Haber.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} are highly {{reactive}} and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, {{they are usually}} stored in mineral oil or kerosene (paraffin oil). They react aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali <b>metal</b> <b>halides,</b> which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride (LiF). The alkali metals also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care. The heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones; for example, when dropped into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium if {{the same number of}} moles of each metal is used. The alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron. Not only do the alkali metals react with water, but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols, gaseous ammonia, and alkynes, the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity. Their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides.|$|E
40|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>halide</b> perovskites {{have been}} brought to the {{forefront}} of research focus in solution-processable photovoltaics, with the device efficiency swiftly surging to over 22 % over the past few years.

40|$|Abstract. A high-intensity {{laboratory}} photo-curing {{unit has}} been developed {{with the aim of}} improving the post-curing properties of composite veneering materials. This study introduces the structure of the curing unit and examines the resulting properties of a representative composite material. The curing unit is equipped with two <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> lamps that radiate both ultraviolet and visible light. Unlike conventional <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> lamps for industrial use, these <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> lamps radiate an increased intensity of visible radiation. Properties of a microfilled composite veneering material cured with the new <b>metal</b> <b>halide</b> unit were ascertained. A xenon photo-curing unit was also used as a control.

25|$|Metal halide {{lights are}} {{generally}} the highest output lighting commercially available. They produce about 90-100 {{lumens per watt}} of power. This is roughly the same as fluorescent. The improvement with <b>metal</b> <b>halides</b> is that they concentrate this light output into a very small space, whereas fluorescent lights evenly illuminate the entire aquarium. This {{is often referred to}} as point source lighting, and is what causes the rippling visual effect on many advanced aquarium setups. This concentration of light output increases the intensity, allowing metal halide lamps to penetrate light to even the very bottom levels of most aquariums. <b>Metal</b> <b>halides</b> are available in many color temperatures, from 6500 K up to 20,000 K, though bulbs as high as 50,000 K are occasionally found. The downsides of metal halide lighting are the initial cost and the heat produced.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used catalysts for this process are <b>metal</b> <b>halides,</b> particularly aluminium chloride.

It may also {{be thought of as a}} disproportionation reaction even though there is no change in the oxidation number for silicon (Si has a nominal oxidation number IV in all three species). However, the utility of the oxidation number concept for a covalent molecule, even a polar covalent molecule, is ambiguous. The silicon atom could be rationalized as having the highest formal oxidation state and partial positive charge in SiCl4 and the lowest formal oxidation state in SiH4 since Cl is far more electronegative than is H.|$|E
