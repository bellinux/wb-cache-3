5000|$|Aquila of Sinope, a 2nd-century CE Greek {{convert to}} Christianity {{and later to}} Judaism, {{undertook}} two translations of the Psalms from Hebrew to Greek.

And as soon as I opened my hand to let it go, it just {{exploded}} instantly. And I came back, and the hand was completely severed off."The detonation amputated his right hand, and sprayed his body with shrapnel. Petry likely saved the two other soldiers from serious injury or death.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{also spoke}} about O'Neal in 2001 with Rabbi Shmuley. He {{described}} holding hands with her: [...] "I was, like, in heaven. It {{was the most}} magical thing. It was better than kissing her, {{it was better than}} anything." [...] He recalled one of the times they held hands:I remember we went to this club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called the Roxy. And I was watching the band, I was sitting there, and underneath the table, she was holding <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> I was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off. It was all I needed. But that means nothing to kids today. She grew up too fast. She wasn't into innocence, and I love that.|$|E
500|$|According to Moss, Peggy [...] "has the {{capability}} of being a Don Draper, and there can't be {{two of them in}} the office." [...] The goodbye scene between Don and Peggy was a difficult one to shoot. Moss said, [...] "That scene was a really, really tough scene to do. They didn't tell me {{they were going to do}} this, but they told Jon to hold <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> not let it go. Then he did, and I lost it. Every single one of those tears were absolutely real. She wants to stay with all of her heart. She does not want to leave, but she knows she has to." [...] Hamm said there was [...] "respect, understanding, and admiration between those two characters. This is the exact right time for her to leave." ...|$|E

500|$|In casting his nine-member crew, Whedon looked {{first at}} the actors and {{considered}} their chemistry with others. Cast member Sean Maher recalls, [...] "So then he just sort of put us all together, and I {{think it was very}} quick, like right out of the gate, we all instantly bonded". All nine cast members were chosen before filming began. However, while filming the original pilot [...] "Serenity", Whedon decided that Rebecca Gayheart was unsuitable for the role of Inara Serra, and shot her scenes in singles so that {{it would be easier to}} replace her. Morena Baccarin auditioned for the role and two days later was on the set in her first television show. [...] "Joss brought me down from the testing room like a proud dad, holding <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> introducing me," [...] Baccarin recalled.|$|E
500|$|Egan {{joked that}} {{although}} [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] was [...] "fun" [...] to perform, she felt much more [...] "white" [...] than usual recording alongside the five singers {{cast as the}} Muses, who provide the song's back up vocals. Familiar with singers Cheryl Freeman, Lillias White, Vaneese Y. Thomas, LaChanze and Roz Ryan's Broadway work, Egan felt intimated by their powerful voices and riffing abilities. Egan recalled, [...] "Alan would say, 'Okay Lillias (White), just do a riff over there and LaChanze, you do a little something over here and Susan, just at the end, get from this note to this note and just do a riff.' I raise <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> I'm like, 'Umm, can you plunk {{it out on the}} piano?' He looks at me like, 'Are you kidding?'" [...] While it took Egan half an hour to solidify only one of her riffs, the other singers recorded multiple takes of theirs within that same time; Egan was greatly humbled by the experience. On the film's soundtrack, only Egan and Freeman are credited as vocalists on the track. Menken also produced the song. Danny Troob arranged the song while Michael Kosarin conducted the orchestration.|$|E
500|$|On July 5, {{with the}} Indians in Chicago {{in the midst}} of a road trip, Doby made his debut as the second black {{baseball}} player after Robinson to play in the majors after establishment of the baseball color line. Veeck hired two plainclothes police officers to accompany Doby as he went to Comiskey Park. Player-manager Lou Boudreau initially had a hard time finding a place in the lineup for Doby, who had played second base and shortstop for most of his career. Boudreau himself was the regular shortstop, while Joe Gordon was the second baseman. That day, Doby met his new teammates for the first time. [...] "I walked down that line, stuck out <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> very few hands came back in return. Most of the ones that did were cold-fish handshakes, along with a look that said, 'You don't belong here", Doby reminisced years later. Four of Doby's teammates did not shake his hand, and of those, two turned their backs to Doby when he tried to introduce himself. During warm-ups, Doby languished for minutes while his teammates interacted with one another. Not until Joe Gordon asked Doby to play catch with him was Doby given the chance to engage. Gordon befriended Doby and became one of his closest friends on the team.|$|E

500|$|Ali {{learned that}} his {{regurgitation}} talents {{had the potential to}} entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen:I tried out my tricks first of all in the street, swallowing many glasses of water and then pouring forth a great fountain {{from one side of the}} road to the other... A cafe proprietor saw me doing this one day, and chased me down the street. I thought he wanted to beat me up, but no—all he did was to put a coin in <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> ask me to repeat the trick. Finally, he was so delighted that he asked me to come to his cafe and entertain the customers. Taking his abilities on the road, Ali met an Italian man in Cairo who signed him to a contract for music hall performances. Ali performed under contract throughout Europe and at times for heads of state. According to Ali, in or about 1914 he was summoned by Tsar NicholasII of Russia to perform at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He stated that the Tsar [...] "must have liked my performance because he awarded me a special decoration, which is now one of my most treasured possessions." [...] Following World War I, Ali began managing his own affairs and toured the world, learning more tricks as he went.|$|E

When we were actually lying down I felt a bit humiliated but I also felt apprehensive about what was going to happen next. One of the Argentine officers came along and actually struck one of the guards and told us to stand up. We stood up and he shook <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> a few other guys' hands and said that we shouldn't lie down, that we should be proud of what we'd done." ...|$|E
