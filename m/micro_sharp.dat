50|$|Historically, Task Network Modeling {{stems from}} queuing theory and {{modeling}} of engineering reliability and quality control. Art Siegel, a psychologist, first though of extending reliability methods into a Monte Carlo simulation model of human-machine performance (Siegel & Wolf, 1969). In the early 1970s, the U.S. Air Force sponsored {{the development of}} SAINT (Systems Analysis of Integrated Networks of Tasks), a high-level programming language specifically designed to support the programming of Monte Carlo simulations of human-machine task networks (Wortman, Pritsker, Seum, Seifert, & Chubb, 1974). A modern version of this software is <b>Micro</b> Saint <b>Sharp</b> (Archer, Headley, & Allender, 2003). This family of software spawned a tree of special-purpose programs {{with varying degrees of}} commonality and specificity with Micro Saint. The most prominent of these is the IMPRINT series (Improved Performance Research Integration Tool) sponsored by the U.S. Army (and based on MANPRINT) which provides modeling templates specifically adapted to particular human performance modeling applications (Archer et al., 2003). Two workload-specific programs are W/INDEX (North & Riley, 1989) and WinCrew (Lockett, 1997).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{formability}} of ultra-fine grained {{stainless steel}} is investigated in micro hydromechanical deep drawing. The materials used are ultra-fine grained stainless steel and SUS 304 -H with thickness of 20 and 50 μm. The micro cups are successfully fabricated for the ultra-fine grained stainless steel but it cannot be fabricated for SUS 304 -H with thickness of 20 μm. The fracture type of ultra-fine grained stainless steel foil is {{the shortage of}} tensile strength at plain strain state and does not change with a decrease of the thickness. In contrast, the fracture type of SUS 304 -H foil changes to the bending deformation with decreasing the thickness due to its low ductility. The ultra-fine grained metal foil is required to obtain the high formability and fabricate the <b>sharp</b> <b>micro</b> cups...|$|R
40|$|In {{a period}} of {{continuous}} change in global business environment, organizations, large and small, are finding {{it increasingly difficult to}} deal with, and adjust to the demands for such change. Simulation is a powerful tool for allowing designers imagines new systems and enabling them to both quantify and observe behavior. Currently the market offers a variety of simulation software packages. Some are less expensive than others. Some are generic and {{can be used in a}} wide variety of application areas while others are more specific. Some have powerful features for modeling while others provide only basic features. Modeling approaches and strategies are different for different packages. Companies are seeking advice about the desirable features of software for manufacturing simulation, depending on the purpose of its use. Because of this, the importance of an adequate approach to simulation software evaluation and comparison is apparent. This paper presents a critical evaluation of four widely used manufacturing simulators: NX-IDEAS, Star-CD, <b>Micro</b> Saint <b>Sharp</b> and ProModel. Following a review of research into simulation software evaluation, an evaluation and comparison of the above simulators is performed. This paper illustrates and assesses the role the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) played in simulation software evaluation and selection. The main purpose of this evaluation and comparison is to discover the suitability of certain types of simulators for particular purposes...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} for determining micro-mesopore size distribution developed by Nguyen and Do [Nguyen, C.; Do, D. D. Langmuir 1999, 15, 3608] is tested with nitrogen adsorption data at 77 K and benzene adsorption data at near ambient temperatures of two carbonaceous samples. The PSD results using nitrogen data are {{compared with the}} results obtained from the DFT technique. In general, they agree very well with each other, though <b>sharper</b> <b>micro</b> and mesopore peaks are observed with our results. The PSDs derived from benzene adsorption data using our technique are practically independent of temperature, reinforcing the assertion that the PSD is the porous media 2 ̆ 7 s intrinsic property. However when this benzene-derived PSD is compared with nitrogen-derived PSD, some small but subtle differences are observed. This {{could be due to}} the difference in the gas-solid interaction, the molecule packing in pores, and the adsorption temperatures of nitrogen (77 K) and benzene (near ambient) ...|$|R
