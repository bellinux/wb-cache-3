40|$|International audienceIn {{intelligent}} vehicles applications, Multi-Target Tracking (MTT) {{is usually}} done considering imperfect sensors' data. As belief functions {{and particularly the}} Transferable Belief Model (TBM) help to model these imperfections, it represents an interesting framework for MTT. To carry out target tracking, the system {{must be able to}} de fine at time k the relations between the detected objects (targets) and the already known ones (tracks). The correlation step is called Multi-Object Association (MOA). This paper tackles the problem of TBM-MOA decision making. The aim is to present a methodology and measures for the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>associations</b> in presence of conflicting sensors' measures. A new algorithm based on a single association matrix gathering all the knowledge of the targets-to-tracks associations is presented. It provides a semantic to avoid the aforementioned di culties. Simulation results of an obstacle detection application show the advantages of the proposed solution...|$|E
40|$|The waste pickers social {{movement}} has won important public policies {{to improve its}} activity and recycling. In thispaper, after identifying social and environmental policy instruments related to recycling, the difficulties faced by thewaste pickers associations (WAs) to apply them are discussed. Documental analysis of these instruments reveals implicitcontradictions, made apparent when these policies are confronted to the daily experiences of waste pickers. Given thesecontradictions, our thesis is {{that in addition to}} political action, the durable performance of WAs depends on thesustainability of operational processes. Analyses from an operational point of view, held by a technical group integratedin the social network that supports the organization and operational <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>associations,</b> identify weaknessesto be overcome to give sustainability to the WAs and recycling as a socio-environmental alternative treatment of urbanwaste. More than reinforcing policies, we emphasize the need for coordinated actions organized in a specific strategy,under the governance of the waste pickers {{social movement}}...|$|E
40|$|Projecte realitzat en col. laboració amb el centre École Centrale ParisWhen {{looking for}} {{documents}} related to project management thousands of references appear. However {{just a few of}} them are specific to cooperation projects. This thesis discusses cooperation from a university point of view by following a general to specific approach. The existence of an association that supports the students who take part in cooperation projects ensures higher levels of quality and effectiveness. Likewise it facilitates the involvement of students, professors and other university workers in the cooperation. Therefore in the first chapter we propose a methodology of <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>associations</b> of students for cooperation. 10 By the time a project is developed there are certain recommendable practices to follow during the pre‐execution, the execution and the post‐execution of the project. The second chapter presents a methodology of management of cooperation projects. Since the methodology has been conceived for generic projects, it may be useful for anyone willing to develop a cooperation project in any field. Eventually, the third chapter contains real examples of cooperation projects. Based on the experience and background of the writers, the examples are related to the use of wireless networks to provide connection in rural areas. In the chapter we develop a benchmark study of different suitable technologies, an analysis of the tools required for the design of the projects and ultimately two examples of projects developed in Perú and Chile respectively...|$|E
