5000|$|Eimuntas Nekrošius, born 1952, is a {{graduate}} of the Lunacharsky Art Institute (today Russian Academy of Theatre Arts) in Moscow. He began is directing career as the “enfant terrible” of the Vilnus State Youth Theater, working there from 1978 to 1991, with a short stint from 1979 to 1980 at the Kaunas National Drama Theatre. During the Soviet era, major works that he produced include such as The Square by Yeliseyeva in 1980, Love and Death in Verona by Antanėlis and Geda (1982), Pirosmani, Pirosmani, A Day Longer Than a Hundred Years by Aitmatov (1983) and Uncle Vanya by Chekhov (1986). Of these the two most important were The Square and Uncle Vanya. In the first, life in prison was measured by counting sugar cubes, which audiences interpreted as a metaphor for Soviet life and in the latter, Astrov’s maps were tiny postage stamps, which Yelena viewed through a very large <b>magnifying</b> <b>screen.</b> This performance of Uncle Vanya broke the tradition of staging this play set by Constantin Stanislavski [...] His performances produced by the LIFE Festival include Mozart and Salieri, Don Juan, Plague by Pushkin (1994), Three Sisters by Chekhov (1995) and Love and Death in Verona (1996), all of which were also presented at various international theater festivals. [...] This work popularized a new trend in Lithuanian theatre based on poetry and metaphor, with the main focus on psychology and emotion with relatively plastic acting. Scenery, while sparse, is important to give multiple layers to the use of metaphor. [...] Nekrošius has continued with this style of production as founder and director of Meno Fortas, founded 1998. The director has received a number of awards for his work include best stage director of the year by Lithuanian Critique, the New Reality in Europe Theater by the Europe Theater Union and the Taormina Art Festival committee and the UBU Premium of Italy.|$|E

30|$|There {{were some}} {{limitations}} of this study. The relatively small size of our cohorts may have given underpowered findings, but due to the high intra- and inter-observer agreement between both cohorts, our conclusions are well supported. Since the use of Bone Ninja is new when compared to current PACS, medical personnel could have had difficulties in using this new platform; however, the time required for measurements with Bone Ninja was reduced compared to PACS. Hence, once medical personnel are more comfortable with this application, the time difference can be <b>magnified.</b> The <b>screen</b> size is larger for PACS than for the iPAD, although measurements were as accurate on the smaller iPad screen as the larger PACS screen. Lastly, this study was performed in a university center, with an ACGME certified orthopedic residency program, hence the reproducibility of our findings may be reduced in tertiary practices.|$|R
50|$|Since {{computer}} interfaces often solicit visual {{input and}} provide visual feedback, another significant challenge in computer accessibility involves making software usable {{by people with}} visual impairments. For individuals with mild to medium vision impairment, {{it is helpful to}} use large fonts, high DPI displays, high-contrast themes and icons supplemented with auditory feedback and <b>screen</b> <b>magnifying</b> software. In the case of severe vision impairment such as blindness, screen reader software that provides feedback via text to speech or a refreshable braille display is a necessary accommodation for interaction with a computer.|$|R

25|$|Fusion {{splicing}} is {{done with}} a specialized instrument. The fiber ends are first stripped of their protective polymer coating (as well as the more sturdy outer jacket, if present). The ends are cleaved (cut) with a precision cleaver to make them perpendicular, and are placed into special holders in the fusion splicer. The splice is usually inspected via a <b>magnified</b> viewing <b>screen</b> to check the cleaves {{before and after the}} splice. The splicer uses small motors to align the end faces together, and emits a small spark between electrodes at the gap to burn off dust and moisture. Then the splicer generates a larger spark that raises the temperature above the melting point of the glass, fusing the ends together permanently. The location and energy of the spark is carefully controlled so that the molten core and cladding do not mix, and this minimizes optical loss. A splice loss estimate is measured by the splicer, by directing light through the cladding on one side and measuring the light leaking from the cladding on the other side. A splice loss under 0.1dB is typical. The complexity of this process makes fiber splicing much more difficult than splicing copper wire.|$|R
50|$|The {{projector}} magnifies {{the profile}} of the specimen, and displays this on the built-in projection screen. On this screen there is typically a grid that can be rotated 360 degrees so the X-Y axis of the screen can be aligned with a straight edge of the machined part to examine or measure. This projection screen displays {{the profile of}} the specimen and is magnified for better ease of calculating linear measurements.An edge of the specimen to examine may be lined up with the grid on the screen. From there, simple measurements may be taken for distances to other points. This is being done on a magnified profile of the specimen. It can be simpler as well as reduce errors by measuring on the <b>magnified</b> projection <b>screen</b> of a profile projector. The typical method for lighting is by diascopic illumination, which is lighting from behind. This type of lighting is also called transmitted illumination when the specimen is translucent and light can pass through it. If the specimen is opaque, then the light will not go through it, but will form a profile of the specimen. Measuring of the sample can be done on the projection screen. A profile projector may also have episcopic illumination (which is light shining from above). This useful in displaying bores or internal areas that may need to be measured.|$|R
40|$|HOMER II is a {{voice-driven}} text-to-speech system {{developed for}} {{blind or visually}} impaired persons for reading Slovenian texts. Users can obtain texts from the Internet site of the Association of Slovenian Blind and Visually Impaired Persons Societies from their Electronic Information System where they can find daily newspapers, some novels and other information. The system consists of four main modules. The first module enables Internet communication, retrieves text to a local disc and converts it to a standard form. The input interface manages the keyboard entry and/or speaker independent speech recognition. The output interface performs speech synthesis of a given text and in addition prints the same text <b>magnified</b> to the <b>screen.</b> The user dialog is responsible for the user friendly communication and controls other tasks of the system. Homer II was ported from Linux to the MS Windows 9 x/ME/NT/ 2000 operating systems. For the best performance it uses multi-threading and other advantages of the 32 -bit environment. Further versions of the HOMER system with even more advanced dialogue modules and some basic World Wide Web browsing functionality will represent an important tool in the distance learning and teaching process for the impaired persons using academic networks...|$|R

After a short description, the Magician starts the tape with {{what appears to be}} a computer screen placed on it. The Magician prepares a [...] "random piece of paper." [...] A female voice says [...] "Do not touch screen during Vidi-Kopy operation." [...] After a few seconds of digital flashing, a copy of the image drawn on the paper appears on the screen. After a fake [...] "save" [...] function, the Magician is then asked to take a dollar bill out of his pocket, and hold it against the screen and an image of the bill appears on the screen, then the magician presses a fake button on the screen which makes the image <b>magnify</b> on the <b>screen.</b> The Magician then has two options, either turn off the tape and then attempt to sell the fake Vidi-Kopy tape to the victim, or keep the tape rolling for the punch-line. The Magician is supposed to downplay the warnings about touching the screen and place his bare hand on the screen and press the copy button. The image flashes and a copy of his hand is supposed to appear on the screen, which flashes violently, the female voice starts saying [...] "System Failure." [...] The Magician is supposed to scream and act like his hand has been horribly burned.|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this master's thesis is to {{discover}} whether multimedia interactive (MI) boards improve the learning performance of pupils with a minor developmental disorders of learning and cognition (MDDLC) in primary school with an adapted educational program in Basic Computer Skills classes and the non-obligatory course of Computer Science. The learning environment that an MI board can create is described in the theoretical outline. In the learning environment, the teacher has a better opportunity for successful education of pupils with MDDLC. The benefits and drawbacks of different sorts of MI boards, that {{are available on the}} market, are described in the thesis. These {{must be taken into account}} by teachers when creating the aforementioned learning environment. The inclusion of MI boards as a modern learning tool in the learning process requires technical and didactic knowledge as well as skills from both pupils and teachers. The inclusion has multiple stages, from the introduction to usage and finally integration. With phases of redirection and evolution the modern technology enables pupils to actively participate in the class and encourages them to constantly improve. Educational technology should first and foremost support the learning process, and only then it should expand and transform it. The theoretical outline also includes some examples for easier acquisition of needed knowledge and skills. The teacher starts to include the MI board in the curriculum with skills he is already used to, for example use of projectors or the <b>magnified</b> computer <b>screen.</b> With the gradual addition of tools offered, teacher uses the MI board as a multimedia interactive teaching tool. The execution of classes is more effective with planned and quick access to the necessary study material and use of tools that are a part of the software. Pupil motivation is increased because of a big screen, visual support and interactivity of pictures and words. Pupil activity is increased because they are able to cooperate and interact with other pupils and the teacher. MI board effectively support different learning styles which helps teachers with individualization. With an interesting visual presentation, supported with sound and pupil activity, enabled by the MI board, the subject matter is better memorized. The didactic material is saved and can be used again for practice and repetition. The research has been done during Basic Computer Skills classes and the non-obligatory course of Computer Science. Each class had three periods. During the first period we introduced the theme and mode of work to the pupils. During the second period the pupils practiced and repeated the subject matter. During both periods the activity and motivation of pupils was measured. The third period was used for examination of memorization and grading the theoretical and practical knowledge. The periods took place in a computer classroom for both the experimental and control group. The only difference was, that the experimental group used the MI board and the control did not. The actual subject matter depended on which part of the curriculum particular classes discussed at the time of the research. A hypothesis has been formed, aiming to discover whether pupils with MDDLC achieve better results while using the MI board during the learning process. The hypothesis also strived to find whether pupils are more motivated, more active and if they memorize the subject matter better and if their grades are better when using the MI boards. For this purpose, used two groups of pupils, an experimental and a control group. The sample included 29 pupils from two schools with a lower educational standard from Gorenjska. During data analysis we checked for validity, reliability and homogeneity of the sample. The differences between groups has been checked with variance analysis. The results of the research have confirmed that pupils with MDDLC are more active when using the MI board and also more motivated for school work. We however rejected the hypothesis that pupils memorize new expressions easier with the use of MI board. Results also showed that the pupils in the experimental group, where the MI board was used were better with obtaining cognitive knowledge. With the research we proved also that the positive effects of MI board usage does not diminish with prolonged use. ...|$|R
