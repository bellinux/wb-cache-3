The study indicates that proposals for courses on environmental <b>management</b> and <b>climate</b> change should follow a systemic perspective and take sustainable development into account.

40|$|Permanent grasslands {{can provide}} a large {{diversity}} of ecosystem services. They are found in contrasted conditions in terms of <b>management</b> and <b>climate</b> in Europe. These conditions induce {{a wide variety of}} grassland types that differ in their vegetation and are expected to differ with respect to the provision of ecosystem services. Because ecosystem functioning in grassland {{has been shown to be}} linked to plant functional diversity criteria, we put forward that these functional diversity criteria can be used to evaluate the provision of ecosystem services. These criteria are influenced by the <b>management</b> and the <b>climate.</b> The overall objective of this PhD program is to assess the effects of <b>management</b> and <b>climate</b> on the plant functional diversity related to ecosystem services of permanent grasslands. The first step of the PhD program was to select 29 functional diversity criteria related to 8 ecosystem services (quantity of forage, forage quality, stability of the forage production, biodiversity conservation, pollination carbon sequestration, dryness resistance and nitrogen fertility). This selection was made using experts' interview and literature survey. The second step was to evaluate inaccuracies in the calculation of the 29 functional diversity criteria from functional trait databases and different sets of botanical surveys. The third step was to estimate the functional diversity criteria from <b>management</b> and <b>climate</b> data using "Random Forests" methodology. The results show that the climatic variables had generally more effect on the functional diversity than the management ones. Furthermore, for some climatic conditions, the management does not affect some functional diversity criteria. Among the 29 functional diversity criteria, only 8 have more than 40 % of their variance explained by the <b>management</b> and <b>climate</b> variables. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{within the field of}} Industrial and Organisational Psychology. It focuses on the {{relationship}} between diversity <b>management</b> and organisational <b>climate</b> dimensions. The literature review indicates that most of the research conducted on these two concepts, diversity <b>management</b> and organisational <b>climate</b> investigated the concept diversity, not diversity management (Cox, 1993; Hicks-Clarke & Hies, 2003). This study specifically explores diversity management in a retail organisation. The empirical component of the study includes confirmatory factor analysis, reliability analysis and a correlational study investigating the relationship between diversity <b>management</b> and organisational <b>climate.</b> It was found that there is a positive and strong relationship between diversity <b>management</b> and organisational <b>climate.</b> Diversity <b>management</b> seems to correlate highly with the following climate dimensions: policies and procedures, discrimination, gender issues, equality in conditions of employment and employment equity. The results indicate that younger employees have more positive views regarding diversity management, and middle aged employees have less positive views regarding diversity management.
