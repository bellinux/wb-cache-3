40|$|The Debian <b>Med</b> <b>project</b> {{started in}} 2002 with the {{objective}} to bring free medi-cal software into the focus of users. Those may be IT service providers for smaller clinics, the doctors themselves, researchers in pre-clinical environments or just skilled enthusiasts with an ambition to apply their talents to the biomedical do-main. At that time, the communities in computational biology, medical imaging and medical informatics already {{had a number of}} high-quality Free Software so-lutions. Debian as a Linux distribution provided a solid foundation for bringing those products together. To assure complete coverage and harmonic integration, the Debian <b>Med</b> <b>project</b> was initiated to provide a software management infras-tructure to improve communication among Debian package maintainers, e. g. to identify missing glue packages to translate data formats or to point out conflicts in the naming of binaries. Over the past decade, the integrative Debian <b>Med</b> <b>project</b> has proven to have positive effects beyond the scope of Debian users. Many ties have been establishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} interference between the electronic systems or their components influences {{the performance of}} the systems. For that reason, it is important to model these interferences in order to optimize the position of the systems or their components. In this paper, a method is proposed to construct the equivalent emission source models of systems. The proposed method is based on the multipolar expansion by representing the radiated emission of generic structures in a spherical reference (r, theta, phi). Some results are presented illustrating our method.

5000|$|The {{reason to}} {{calculate}} PTA {{is that when}} executing the contract, actual cost is the only finance measurement. Compare this measurement with the cost base line to calculate Cost Performance Index (CPI), then we can estimate (forecast) the cost at Completion ('EAC' - Estimate at Completion - according to PMBOK, or 'FAC' - Forecast at Completion - in <b>Ms</b> <b>Project).</b> If EAC exceeds PTA, the buyer is expected to pay the ceiling price, and any more overruns beyond PTA will cause a dollar for dollar decrease in profit for the seller. The profit decrease rate become higher, and once actual cost exceeds ceiling price the seller will start losing money(and then might stop working for the contract).|$|E
50|$|There are {{differences}} between Open Workbench and Microsoft Project. Chief {{among them is}} that Open Workbench schedules based on effort whereas MS Projects default scheduling method is based on duration, although the user can change the method to work (effort). In other words, in an Open Workbench plan, task schedule {{is driven by the}} number of hours each resource will work per week to cover the total number of hours required for the tasks; whereas Microsoft Project does the reverse by generating estimates for the resources based on the task duration rather than their work availability. For this reason, resource leveling is also different: Open Workbench will do it based on resource availability whereas <b>MS</b> <b>Project</b> will do it based on the next available block of time that fits the task.|$|E
