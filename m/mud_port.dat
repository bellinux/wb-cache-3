40|$|A {{directional}} drilling tool control unit whose design {{is based on}} servo control of a rotary valve using the roll-stabilised instrumented system approach has been successfully used in oil fields for over twenty years. In this paper, Field Oriented Control (FOC) is applied to cascaded voltage regulation and servo control using a open-loop plant model of the roll-stabilised control unit. The servo control {{is applied to the}} rotary valve so that drilling <b>mud</b> is <b>ported</b> in a geostationary direction despite the rotation of the drill string and the bottom hole assembly of the rotary steerable system. Voltage regulation is applied in order to provide a dc voltage bus for the servo control of the valve. A torquer or alternator, which is a type of permanent magnet synchronous machine, is the core of the roll stabilised control unit. So, a mathematical model of the torquer is derived. An FOC scheme is proposed for servo control and to provide a dc regulated voltage using the torquers. The algorithm is tested in MATLAB/Simulink...|$|R

This paper {{takes some}} {{sections}} of Tianjin coast for example, explore the microstructure morphology and index-load combination in {{the condition of}} different settling time with load combination about reclaimed soil {{on the basis of}} sampling and testing of original state reclaimed soil. Including apparent form, size, directionality gap, formation of the skeleton and bulk density changes of the flocculation body aggregate. It found the characteristics and regularities of microstructure of reclaimed soil in the initial settlement. The research claims the structure of reclaimed soil is enhanced and the change of soil microstructure has positive significance to the engineering geological properties. in the process of consolidation The introduction In coastal areas, it is relatively prominent problem about shortage of land resources in the process of urbanization. The geographical expansion of cities is strictly limited by the land use of construction land, Reclaimed soil[1] is using dredge and mud to pump <b>mud</b> and <b>port</b> formed by hydraulic fill by sedimentary soil {{at the bottom of the}} rivers. It has the high water content, high compressibility, high clay content, organic matter, flow, etc. This article mainly research self-organizing microstructure of reclaimed soil[2...|$|R
40|$|In our thesis we {{investigated}} how the shear {{rate and the}} overconsolidation ratio (OCR) influence the measured shear strength in the direct shear apparatus. Shear tests were performed also by comparing the influence of low and higher vertical normal stress {{as well as the}} temporary breakage during shearing to the test results. The test samples were taken from the temporary lagoons, where the dredged <b>mud</b> from the <b>Port</b> of Koper has been stored. The tests performed to identify the physical properties of the mud included determination of: water content, Atterberg limits, particle density, particle size distribution and water adsorption by Enslin Neff. We found that the the shear rate and the overconsolidation ratio have a large influence on the measured shear strenght in the direct shear apparatus...|$|R
5000|$|A whaling captain named John Pope Davenport {{settled at}} El Jarro Point, {{about half a}} mile from today's town, in 1867. Davenport built a 400-foot wharf at the mouth of Agua Puerca Creek ("agua puerca" [...] {{translates}} to [...] "muddy water"). This wharf was built to load the lumber brought down from the hills for shipment to Santa Cruz. A small village grew up around the port and was known as Davenport Landing. The local post office began operations in 1874, but was known only as Davenport. Agua Puerca Creek lived up to its name by bringing down so much <b>mud</b> that the <b>port</b> filled up and steamers could not tie up to the wharf to load lumber. A small extension did not solve the problem. Then a competitor built a longer wharf, but it was destroyed in a storm. Captain Davenport went bankrupt and moved to Santa Cruz. The post office in Davenport Landing closed in 1889.|$|R
50|$|The ancient {{course of}} the Tillingham was rather {{different}} from its present one, as the river discharged into a broad area defined by islands, tidal creeks and salt marshes during the Roman period, rather than the estuary of the River Rother. The thirteenth century {{was a time of}} turmoil, as from the 1240s there was a period of 60 years when weather conditions were extreme. Old Winchelsea, which was built on a huge mound of shingle to the east of the mouth, was threatened with flooding, and ultimately succumbed. Following extensive flooding, including the washing away of the church on 1271, a new town was established further to the west on a hill near Iham, just to the south of the Tillingham, in 1280. In 1287, a great storm deposited large amounts of shingle and <b>mud</b> on the <b>port</b> of Romney, and blocked up the mouth of the River Rother, which carved out a new route to the sea near Rye, where it joined the Tillingham and the River Brede.|$|R
30|$|In the {{simulation}} of drilling rig site test, the signal receiving short section is adjusted and connected {{between the two}} drill collars of the near bit and into the well with the drilling tool. One end of the ground information, downloading device is connected with the three-way connecting pipe of the high-pressure riser pipe, and the other end is connected with the <b>mud</b> tank back-flow <b>port.</b> The flow valve opens to a pre-designed opening to open the shut-off valve between the standpipe and the information drop unit. When the signal reception short reaches the underground predetermined depth, the mud pump is turned on to establish the circulation condition. After the mud pump is stable, save the pump pressure to maintain a certain pump pressure, and then, use the computer control information to realize the different time intervals, the preset pressure pulse signal is sent out. The signal receiving short section receives the pulse signal from the ground pressure in the well bottom and stores it. According to the test results, {{it can be seen}} that the increase of the flow valve opening and the increase of the pump pressure have obvious improvement on the information transmission. The deeper the depth of field, the greater the impact on information delivery. The width of the pulse width increases; the information has significantly improved, especially in the depth of the case; but more than a certain value of the effect is not obvious, the pulse width interval value of 9  s or so; to improve the information pass to take the signal suppression approach, that is, to increase the signal gap on the ground, so that the original received useful signal is much larger than the noise. In the process of information transmission, the depth, pump pressure, pulse width, and flow valve open four factors together, because the depth and pump pressure by the engineering conditions, so the quantitative flow valve opening and pulse width interval is the important factors that should be identified before work.|$|R
