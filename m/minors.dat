5|$|Forming a minor of a pseudoforest by {{contracting}} some of {{its edges}} and deleting others produces another pseudoforest. Therefore, the family of pseudoforests is closed under <b>minors,</b> and the Robertson–Seymour theorem implies that pseudoforests can be characterized {{in terms of a}} finite set of forbidden <b>minors,</b> analogously to Wagner's theorem characterizing the planar graphs as the graphs having neither the complete graph K5 nor the complete bipartite graph K3,3 as <b>minors.</b>|$|E
5|$|Torres was {{initially}} {{sent to the}} <b>minors</b> to begin 2004 but was recalled on April 7 without playing a game for Toledo when Dmitri Young broke his leg. He only appeared in three games (and didn't even have a plate appearance) before the Tigers attempted to outright him to the <b>minors.</b> Instead {{of going to the}} <b>minors,</b> Torres requested his release. He was granted free agency on April 22.|$|E
5|$|After another {{stint in}} the <b>minors</b> in 1949, he was a backup infielder, pinch hitter, and pinch runner for the 1950 Phillies, and {{continued}} in that role through 1952. Following three more years in the <b>minors,</b> Caballero retired from baseball after the 1955 season. After his baseball career ended, Caballero worked as an exterminator. His Louisiana home was destroyed in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina, whereupon he then lived in Lakeview, New Orleans.|$|E
5000|$|Musically, {{the song}} follows a twelve-bar blues {{structure}} in C <b>minor,</b> only with significantly different chord changes.

5|$|Smythe was an NHL owner {{during the}} era before the player's union. The NHL was only six teams and players who didn't toe the line {{could easily be}} demoted to the minor leagues and a {{replacement}} found. Players who didn't follow Smythe's rules were traded or sent to the <b>minors.</b> Two players, Danny Lewicki and John McCormack were both demoted to the <b>minors</b> for getting married without Smythe's permission.|$|E

5|$|While body {{piercing}} has grown more widespread, it can remain controversial, particularly in youth. Some countries impose age of consent laws requiring parental permission for <b>minors</b> to receive {{body piercing}}s. Scotland requires parental consent for youths below 16, while in 2011 Wales began considering a similar law. In addition to imposing parental consent requirements, Western Australia prohibits piercing private areas of <b>minors,</b> including genitals and nipples, on penalty of fine and imprisonment for the piercer. Many {{states in the}} US also require parental consent to pierce <b>minors,</b> with some also requiring the physical presence of the parents during the act. The state of Idaho has imposed a minimum age for body piercing at 14.|$|E
5|$|Duke offers 46 {{arts and}} {{sciences}} majors, four engineering majors, 52 <b>Minors</b> (including two in engineering) and Program II, which allows students to design their own interdisciplinary major in arts & sciences, and IDEAS, which allows students to design their own engineering major. Twenty-four certificate programs also are available. Students pursue a major, and can pursue {{a combination of a}} total of up to three including <b>minors,</b> certificates, and/or a second major.

However, he decided that since he had the same kind of players on the Flyers as he did in the <b>minors,</b> he would use the same systems, becoming the first coach to employ systems.|$|E

5|$|Not in Front of the Children {{explores the}} {{development}} of U.S. case law with different standards of censorship for children and adults. The author describes a 1968 Supreme Court of the United States case, Ginsberg v. New York, where the court upheld a law preventing <b>minors</b> from viewing sexually explicit media. Sam Ginsberg and his wife managed a diner in Bellmore, New York. A mother sent her 16-year-old son to buy two adult magazines at the diner, creating a situation where Ginsberg would be prosecuted. Ginsberg was convicted of violating a New York State law which forbade selling magazines with pictures of nude women to <b>minors.</b>|$|E

5|$|The law was {{a second}} attempt by Senator Yee to enact {{restrictions}} for video game sales to <b>minors.</b> Yee's background as a child psychologist led him to assert there was a connection between video games and violence and believed {{that the government had}} strong interest in restricting video game sales to <b>minors</b> as was already done for pornographic works. In 2004, Yee had drafted a law that would have required mature-rated video games to be stocked separately from other titles. Though the bill ultimately passed as CA Law AB 1793, the bill's language was diluted at its passage, only requiring stores to display the ESRB ratings system and provide information to parents about it.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Han dynasty, {{the land}} tax rate was reduced to one-hundredth, with lost revenue recouped by {{increasing}} the poll and property tax rates. The poll tax for most adults was 120 coins annually, 240 coins for merchants, and 20 coins for <b>minors</b> aged between three and fourteen years. The lower taxable threshold age for <b>minors</b> increased to seven years during the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han (r. 48–33 BC) and onwards. Historian Charles Hucker writes that underreporting of the population by local authorities was deliberate and widespread, since this reduced their tax and labor service obligations rendered to the central government.|$|E
