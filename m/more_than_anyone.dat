5|$|Vilhelm Dahlerup {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} 19th-century architects. Perhaps <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> else, he contributed to the way Copenhagen appears today. His most important buildings include Copenhagen's Hotel D’Angleterre (1875) and the Danish National Gallery (1891). With the support of the Carlsberg company, he designed the Ny Carlsberg Glyptoteque (1897) and a number of lavishly decorated buildings at the Carlsberg Brewery site, now under redevelopment as a new district in Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{excitement}} surrounding King's performance, the Americans did not fare well overall, {{and the results}} may have been worse than hoped for by the tour's promoters. Philadelphia won only two of their fifteen matches, losing nine and earning a draw in the remaining four. After their win against Sussex, the only other win of the tour came against Warwickshire. During this match, King took 5 for 95 and 7 for 72 and scored 46 runs. According to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, King proved himself {{to be the best}} bowler on the American side and had to do much of the work. He bowled three hundred overs, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> else in the team, taking 72 wickets with a bowling average of a little over 24 runs. In addition to his bowling, King scored 441 runs as a batsman at a batting average of just over 20.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, Thomas Huxley {{published}} On {{the animals}} which are most nearly intermediate between birds and reptiles, making {{a strong case}} for the bird-dinosaur ancestral link. Huxley's proposal that birds arose from dinosaurs – based primarily on his observation of the similarities between Archaeopteryx and Compsognathus – remained respectable and widespread in the paleontological community until the publication of The Origin of Birds. Heilmann <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> else was responsible for a widespread rejection of the dinosaur-bird link. His conclusions involved more than the mere rejection of a dinosaurian ancestry for birds, however: for instance, he favored the arboreal origin of avian flight, he allied birds firmly with reptiles instead of mammals, and he was responsible for finally putting an end to the idea that birds descended from pterosaurs. Several aspects of his research have continued to be influential long after its publication.|$|E

5|$|Part Three {{starts with}} the prefectural tournament still in progress. After another win by Seishu, Akane is hospitalized due to an {{unspecified}} illness. Initially, Akaishi's play is affected by worrying about Akane's condition. Ko continues to perform well and promises Akane {{to go on a}} date with her if Seishu reaches Koshien. However, Akane's illness is more severe than expected, and she is scheduled for surgery {{on the morning of the}} prefectural final against Ryuō. Before the game begins, Ko tells Aoba he loves her <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone,</b> but in such a way she thinks he is lying until after Seishu wins in extra innings, clinching a Koshien berth. In the final chapter, the morning before traveling to Koshien, Akaishi visits Akane recovering in the hospital and Ko and Aoba head for the train station holding hands.|$|E
5|$|As of August 27, 2017, 115 golden point {{games have}} been played, with 14 {{remaining}} a draw after the {{ten minutes of}} golden point extra-time. Johnathan Thurston has scored the winning points on four occasions, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> in the NRL. Clinton Schifcofske, Chris Sandow, Trent Hodkinson, Cooper Cronk, Josh Reynolds and Daly Cherry-Evans have each scored the winning points on three occasions. Todd Carney, Jarrod Sammut, Luke Burt, Luke Walsh, Darren Lockyer, Stacey Jones and Mitchell Pearce have also achieved the feat more than once. The Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks have played the most golden point games with 18 in total, while Manly-Warringah have played the least with eleven. The Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs are the most successful team under the format, having won nine of their thirteen golden point matches (including a draw), whilst the Wests Tigers have lost twelve of their sixteen matches. The St. George Illawarra Dragons were the final club to win their first golden point match, after five previous failed attempts. The South Sydney Rabbitohs have featured in the most drawn matches with four, followed by the New Zealand Warriors and Brisbane Broncos with three drawn matches.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs made a {{good start}} to the 1919 season and, despite a brief spell of failure through over-aggression, batted consistently. He scored a double century for Surrey against a touring Australian Imperial Forces cricket team and centuries {{in each of the}} three Gentlemen v Players matches—the only player ever to do so in one season. His rescheduled benefit match raised £1,670, money he used to open a sports shop in London. The shop was {{successful}} and he ran it until just before his death. The additional income gave him considerable financial independence. In total that year, Hobbs scored 2,594 runs in first class matches, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> else, at an average of 60.32. After a winter working in his shop, his good form continued into 1920. Four of his eleven first-class centuries came in consecutive innings in June, and he totalled 2,827 runs at 58.89. He also took five wickets for 21 runs against Warwickshire, and his 17 wickets at an average of 11.82 placed him at the top of the Surrey bowling averages.|$|E

5|$|As Rosenbaum {{describes}} it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté that allows Lex {{to believe that he}} can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same. Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her. The actor believes that Lex's problem {{lies in the fact that}} every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E
5|$|Fei {{sets out}} to destroy Deus and free the Wave Existence and Elly. In Merkaba, the party defeats Deus, but they realize that the energy {{released}} from the Wave Existence's shift will destroy the planet. Elly, inside Deus, tries to move {{it away from the}} planet and Fei, in his Xenogears, follows to save her, but both disappear in the rift. Krelian confronts them, telling Fei he only sought to end the pain and suffering that comes with human existence by reverting everything back to when it all began, when all was one, to ascend to the realm of God. Fei rejects Krelian's ideology with his love for Elly, but Krelian challenges Fei, telling him to prove this love that could make him independent of God, and calls forth Urobolus, a gigantic serpent-like incarnation of Miang. Xenogears appears and Fei uses it to defeat Urobolus. Krelian releases Elly and reveals to Fei that he had planned to become one with God along with Elly. During her time with Krelian, Elly had seen inside his heart and realized it was full of sadness and despair for all the atrocities he had committed. Despite everything, Elly says that Krelian truly loved people <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> else. Because no one will forgive his sins, he declines Fei's offer to return and ascends to a higher plain of existence along with the Wave Existence, telling Fei and Elly that he envies them. Fei and Elly then return to their planet along with Xenogears and reunite {{with the rest of the}} party.|$|E
5|$|They realise {{that this}} was a trap {{arranged}} by Kovarian, as the Silence begin to escape confinement and overload the eyedrives (including Madame Kovarian's), killing their users. The Doctor and River escape {{to the top of the}} pyramid while Amy and Rory fight off a wave of Silence and Amy realises who Rory is. Madame Kovarian dislodges her own eyedrive as it begins to overload, but Amy forces it back in place with the intention of killing her as revenge for Kovarian taking her child (Melody Pond) away. Amy and Rory regroup with River and the Doctor. River tries to convince the Doctor that this frozen timeline is acceptable and that he does not have to die, but the Doctor explains that all of reality will soon break down. River claims she'll suffer <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> else in the universe if she has to kill the Doctor, despite his horror at the idea. To stop it, the Doctor marries River on the spot and whispers something in her ear, declaring that he had just told her his name. He then requests that River allow him to prevent the universe's destruction. The two kiss, and reality begins to return to normal.|$|E

5|$|Lesnar's next {{opponent}} was Big Show and Heyman {{was convinced}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> that Lesnar could not win, {{trying to talk}} him out of defending the title. Lesnar refused and defended the title against Show at Survivor Series on November 17, Lesnar performed an F-5 on Show, but Heyman pulled the referee out of the ring, voiding the pinfall. This allowed Show to chokeslam Lesnar on a steel chair to win the title. This loss was Lesnar's first pinfall loss in WWE and led Lesnar to turn into a fan favorite. Following Survivor Series, Heyman made it clear that Lesnar would not get a rematch, and had snuck a special clause saying so into his contract. In order to gain his revenge on Big Show and Heyman, Lesnar interfered in his first title defense, which came against Kurt Angle the next month at Armageddon on December 15, where Lesnar executed the F-5 on Big Show, which enabled Angle to pin him and win the title. On the following episode of SmackDown!, however, Angle introduced Heyman as his manager and, despite promising Lesnar a title shot earlier in the evening, declared that Lesnar still would not get it. Lesnar's rivalry with Heyman and Big Show resumed, which culminated in a match at the Royal Rumble in January 2003 with the winner being placed into the Royal Rumble later in the evening. On January 19, Lesnar would defeat Show and entered the Royal Rumble match as the No. 29 entry, the second to last competitor to enter the match. He eliminated Matt Hardy and The World's Greatest Tag Team, which was composed of Charlie Haas and his former OVW teammate Shelton Benjamin, who were mentored by Angle. Lesnar would then eliminate The Undertaker last and win the Royal Rumble, which guaranteed him a title match at WrestleMania XIX. After the Royal Rumble, Lesnar and Chris Benoit defeated Angle, Haas and Benjamin at No Way Out on February 23. During the match at WrestleMania XIX on March 30, Lesnar botched a shooting star press, a move he had done numerous times in developmental matches, and jammed his head and neck. This stunned Lesnar and forced Angle and Lesnar to improvise the finish of the match – a pinfall by Lesnar that allowed him to win his second WWE Championship. Lesnar was diagnosed with a concussion from the botched shooting star press.|$|E

25|$|As a {{synthesizer}} {{and electric}} keyboard player, Sun Ra ranks among {{one of the}} earliest and most radical pioneers. By the mid-1950s, he used a variety of electric keyboards, and almost immediately, he exploited their potential perhaps <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone,</b> sometimes modifying them himself to produce sounds rarely if ever heard before. His live albums from the late 1960s and early 1970s feature some of the noisiest, most bizarre keyboard work ever recorded.|$|E
25|$|Agent-neutral consequentialism {{ignores the}} {{specific}} value {{a state of}} affairs has for any particular agent. Thus, in an agent-neutral theory, an actor's personal goals do not count any <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> else's goals in evaluating what action the actor should take. Agent-focused consequentialism, on the other hand, focuses on the particular needs of the moral agent. Thus, in an agent-focused account, such as one that Peter Railton outlines, the agent might be concerned with the general welfare, but the agent {{is more concerned with}} the immediate welfare of herself and her friends and family.|$|E
25|$|Radford {{was not a}} {{particular}} success at Lancashire, failing to take 50 first-class wickets in any of his five seasons with the club, and he was dismissed {{at the end of}} 1984. By this time, however, he had qualified for England by residence, and so was sought after by several other counties. He chose to join Worcestershire, and his decision was repaid handsomely: he took 101 wickets with his right-arm fast-medium bowling in 1985, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> else, and was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year the following year.|$|E
