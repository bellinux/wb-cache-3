40|$|Nurses’ {{musculoskeletal}} problems {{constitute the}} major occupational disability source, worldwide. The prevalence of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>diseases</b> and especially backache is increased at alarming rates among nurse staff {{compared to the}} general population. Aim: The {{purpose of the present}} review was to explore the relation between <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>diseases</b> and nursing staff. The method οf this study included bibliography research from both the review and the research literature which referred to the impact of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>diseases</b> on the health of nursing staff. Results: The majority of research studies showed that the main cause for <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>diseases</b> is the manual moving of patients. Others responsible factors that lead to the manifestation of these diseases are bad body attitude, longtime standing on feet, years of employment, non-ergonomic design of the environment, as well as various other factors related with predisposition. Although, multiple methods have been used to control and eliminate these problems, their application has not been proved to contribute in reducing <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>diseases.</b> Conclusions: The present review confirms that there is an increased frequency occurrence of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>diseases</b> to nurses, and especially those of the lumbar degree. Prevention through education, as well as the early identification of the nurses at risk may decrease the incidence of long-term deleterious effects to health...|$|R

50|$|Currently, {{the cause}} of these chronic {{symptoms}} is not fully known. Markers of autoimmune or rheumatoid disease have not been found in people reporting chronic symptoms. However, some evidence from humans and animal models suggests chikungunya {{may be able to}} establish chronic infections within the host. Viral antigen was detected in a muscle biopsy of a person suffering a recurrent episode of disease three months after initial onset. Additionally, viral antigen and viral RNA were found in macrophages in the synovial joint of a person experiencing a relapse of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disease</b> 18 months after initial infection. Several animal models have also suggested chikungunya virus may establish persistent infections. In a mouse model, viral RNA was detected specifically in joint-associated tissue for at least 16 weeks after inoculation, and was associated with chronic synovitis. Similarly, another study reported detection of a viral reporter gene in joint tissue of mice for weeks after inoculation. In a nonhuman primate model, chikungunya virus was found to persist in the spleen for at least six weeks.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Musculoskeletal {{diseases}} {{are becoming increasingly}} important due to population aging. However, studies on the economic burden of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disease</b> in Korea are scarce. Therefore, we conducted a population-based study to measure the economic burden of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disease</b> in Korea using nationally representative data. Methods This study {{used a variety of}} data sources such as national health insurance statistics, the Korea Health Panel study and cause of death reports generated by the Korea National Statistical Office to estimate the economic burden of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disease.</b> The total cost of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disease</b> was estimated as the sum of direct medical care costs, direct non-medical care costs, and indirect costs. Direct medical care costs are composed of the costs paid by the insurer and patients, over the counter drugs costs, and other costs such as medical equipment costs. Direct non-medical costs are composed of transportation and caregiver costs. Indirect costs are the sum of the costs associated with premature death and the costs due to productivity loss. Age, sex, and disease specific costs were estimated. Results Among the musculoskeletal diseases, the highest costs are associated with other dorsopathies, followed by disc disorder and arthrosis. The direct medical and direct non-medical costs of all musculoskeletal diseases were $ 4. 18 billion and $ 338 million in 2008, respectively. Among the indirect costs, those due to productivity loss were $ 2. 28 billion and costs due to premature death were $ 79 million. The proportions of the total costs incurred by male and female patients were 33. 8 % and 66. 2 %, respectively, and the cost due to the female adult aged 20 - 64 years old was highest. The total economic cost of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disease</b> was $ 6. 89 billion, which represents 0. 7 % of the Korean gross domestic product. Conclusions The economic burden of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disease</b> in Korea is substantial. As the Korean population continues to age, the economic burden of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disease</b> will continue to increase. Policy measures aimed at controlling the cost of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disease</b> are therefore required. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Musculoskeletal</b> <b>disease</b> is a {{collection}} of various conditions, which include rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and osteoporosis. Collectively these conditions {{have a significant impact on}} quality of life. The general population is increasingly ageing and as a consequence the incidence of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disease</b> is rising. Because resources are limited a challenge arises. Methods to improve pharmaceutical care need to be explored. Medication plays an important role in the management of osteoporosis. Secondly patients with fractures, rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis undergoing surgery are at risk of drug related problems. Studies have shown pharmaceutical care in these areas can be improved. Therefore, we performed a number of studies to determine the effects of direct involvement of pharmacists and their teams in specialised pharmaceutical care in patients with <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disease.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{present the}} {{prevalence}} of self reported <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>diseases,</b> the coexistence of these diseases, the test-retest reliability with six months in between, and the association with musculoskeletal pain symptoms. METHODS: Twelve layman descriptions of common <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>diseases</b> {{were part of the}} questionnaires of a prospective cohort study of a random sample in the general Dutch population aged 25 years or more (baseline: n= 3664, follow up after six months: n= 2338). Data collection also included information about pain relating to five different anatomical areas. RESULTS: Osteoarthritis of the knee (men 10. 1 %, women 13. 6 %) was amongst the most reported <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>diseases,</b> whereas the figures for self reported rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were 1. 6 % and 4. 6 % for men and women, respectively. The coexistence of these diseases is high: 47 of the 66 combinations were reported more often than would be expected if they were independent of each other (p< 0. 05). For most diseases the test-retest reliability was good (kappa between 0. 6 and 0. 8), but for repetitive strain injury (kappa= 0. 37) and chronic arthritis other than RA (kappa= 0. 44) the agreement was fair to moderate. All complaints of pain were more often reported by those with <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>diseases</b> than those without those diseases, and the pain pattern was disease-specific. CONCLUSIONS: Self reported <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>diseases</b> are highly prevalent, with a fair to good reliability and a disease-specific pain pattern.
