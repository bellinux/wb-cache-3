50|$|Image {{stabilizer}} mode switch: This switch {{is found}} on many EF lenses that feature an image stabilizer, {{particularly those of}} longer focal lengths. The switch has two settings on most lenses: Mode 1 and Mode 2. The newest IS Mark II versions of certain EF super telephoto lenses (the 300mm f/2.8L, 400mm f/2.8L, 500mm f/4L, and 600mm f/4L), plus the 200-400mm f/4L IS and 100-400mm f/4-5.6L IS II, have a third setting, Mode 3. Mode 1 is normal mode, used for typical photography, where the subject does not <b>move.</b> <b>Mode</b> 2 is used for panning; this is useful for sports or wildlife photography, where the subject moves constantly and one will need to pan. Mode 3, intended to track action, is similar to Mode 2 in that it ignores panning; however, it only applies stabilization when the shutter is released—the viewfinder image is not stabilized. One should not use Mode 1 for panning as this will typically cause blurred photographs; the image stabilizer will attempt to correct for all motion, including the panning motion, but cannot do so due to the limited range of motion of the IS mechanism. Older lenses that have an image stabilizer, but do not feature this switch, are permanently in Mode 1. Some newer lenses, such as the Canon EF-S 18-200mm lens, are able to detect if they are being panned in either axis and will automatically disable the stabilization for the axis parallel to movement and therefore do not require this switch.|$|E
30|$|Forestiero et al. {{proposed}} a descriptor sorting and replication algorithm for peer-to-peer grids called Antares[*]in (Forestiero et al. 2007). This {{approach is not}} only ant inspired, but can also be categorized as brood sorting[*]such as described in (Mamei et al. 2006). The descriptors are bit strings encoded by locality sensitive hash algorithms (see Kulis and Grauman 2009). In contrast to standard hash algorithms, similar content results in similar hash values. This helps to sort similar content based on its hash value. The sorting is done by ant-inspired agents that travel the grid and pick and drop descriptors. Agents operate in two modes, copy and move. In copy mode the agent creates {{a replica of the}} descriptor, whereas in <b>move</b> <b>mode</b> not. The transition between these states is pheromone based. In the beginning, each agent starts in the copy mode. At some point, when the resources are better sorted, the activity of the agent decreases. Then, the agent starts to increase its pheromone level until a given threshold and subsequently switches to the <b>move</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E

The flat scenario includes videos belonging to flat surfaces such as walls and skies. The indoor scenario comprises videos representing offices or stores, and the outdoor scenario contains videos of open {{areas such as}} gardens. For each scenario, we used three different acquisition modes: still mode, where the user stands still while capturing the video; <b>move</b> <b>mode,</b> where the user walks while capturing the video; panrot mode, where the user performs a recoding combining a pan and a rotation. Furthermore, the videos belonging to each scenario were exchanged via YouTube and WhatsApp social media platforms.|$|E

Static tester for blue ray optical storage {{plays an important role in}} storage media research. We designed and constructed a static tester, in which modularization makes it very convenient to expand function. Employment of modulation/demodulation technique weakens test error so as to increase test precision. Focus <b>move</b> <b>mode</b> and the nano-positioners facilitate the relocation of recording marks. Only one laser with wavelength 406. 7 nm is used. In this paper, system design and characteristics are represented in detail, and some experimental results are also given to show that the static tester can perform successfully, acting as research platform for blue ray optical storage.
