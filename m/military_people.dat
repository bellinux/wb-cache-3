25|$|Every year, the subfreshman {{social studies}} class spends {{part of the}} second {{semester}} working on an oral history project. Social studies teacher Janet Morford's class works with WILL radio station to conduct interviews on a certain topic, which varies by year. Past topics have included inside views of the <b>military,</b> <b>people</b> with disabilities, counterculture, the right to marry, and affirmative action in education. Subfreshmen are split into groups to conduct interviews. Each group member is assigned a role (either interviewer, team captain, technician, or scribe) in the interview, and the groups spend several weeks researching relevant information on their subject's life before conducting the interview. A group of older students, called WILL Interns, work with the interview material produced by the subfreshmen {{and turn it into}} an hour-long documentary.|$|E
25|$|For most of {{the period}} of President Porfirio Díaz's regime (1876-1911), the state was in {{relative}} peace, electing nine governors, although only two of these were Guerrero natives. The economy became concentrated {{in the hands of}} a few landholders, <b>military</b> <b>people</b> and others. While the era was relatively prosperous, very little of this benefit reached the common people. Laws were passed and infrastructure in the state was created to benefit the major players of the economy. In addition, indigenous people were forced from the north to the south to work, such as the Kickapoos who were forced to work in the haciendas of the Costa Chica. Some of the first factories built in the state were constructed during this period. Acapulco was connected to Mexico City by rail in the 1890s. Despite the economic development, many people remained without work at the very end of the 19th century as mining and cotton farming waned.|$|E

In his book Project Alberta, Harlow Russ, a civilian scientist with Project Alberta who was part of the Fat man bomb assembly team, recounts that during the flight he asked Uanna why all the <b>military</b> <b>people</b> on the plane were armed, and Uanna informed him that while the islands that they were stopping at were held by US forces, they would be flying over or close to other islands that were still occupied by the Japanese. Because of the remote chance that they might be engaged by Japanese aircraft or anti-aircraft guns, they flew over these islands at night.|$|E

2500|$|Ernie Pike is a comics series {{written by}} Héctor Germán Oesterheld and {{originally}} drawn by Hugo Pratt, starring a World War II and Korean War reporter.

The reporter, loosely based on the real reporter Ernie Pyle, acts as a narrator of stories, without being directly involved in them. Such stories do not narrate real battles or exploits of noteworthy <b>military</b> <b>people,</b> being instead tragic stories of unknown soldiers, made up by the author. Oesterheld worked again with the character {{during the time of the}} Vietnam War, and Ricardo Barreiro used it for a brief story about the Falklands War.|$|E

Shortly after the onset of Operation Barbarossa in 1941, the Russian rear services experienced severe difficulties, which were fixed after the order On Organization of the Rear Services Management Office of the Red Army... was enacted by the People's Commissar for Defence, Marshal of the Soviet Union Semyon Timoshenko. The Rear Services of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union were renamed as the Rear Services of the Armed Forces of Russia in 1991.|$|E
2500|$|Ament, {{writing to}} Rev.

I visited - beginning on the south - Wen An, Pao Ting Hsien, Pa Chou, P'ing Ting, Cho Chou, Liang Hsiang, and on the east, Shun Yi. I found the officials in all these places exceedingly friendly and anxious to settle the affairs of the converts, recognizing the right and the need of such claims. I have made no use of foreign soldiers and brought no external pressure to bear, relying on the justice of our claims. Mr. Conger has supported us in the measures and methods taken, though the <b>military</b> <b>people</b> have not failed to make criticisms. The survivors in all our country stations have been recouped for all their losses, again reinstated in their villages, with some money in hand, and a promise of houses restored next spring. Over and above restoration for the converts there has been gathered a fund for the support of widows and orphans, who have no homes and have no one to look after them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Canadian radio {{engineer}} Wilbert B. Smith, {{who worked}} for the Canadian Department of Transport, was interested in flying saucer propulsion technology and wondered if the assertions in the just-published Scully and Keyhoe books were factual. In September 1950, he had the Canadian embassy in Washington D.C. arrange contact with U.S. officials to try to discover the truth of the matter. Smith was briefed by Dr. Robert Sarbacher, a physicist and consultant to the Defense Department's Research and Development Board. [...] Other correspondence, having to do with Keyhoe needing to get clearance to publish another article on Smith's theories of UFO propulsion, indicated that Bush and his group were operating out of the Research and Development Board. Smith then briefed superiors in the Canadian government, leading to the establishment of Project Magnet, a small Canadian government UFO research effort. Canadian documents and Smith's private papers were uncovered in the late 1970s, and by 1984, other alleged documents emerged claiming the existence of a highly secret UFO oversight committee of scientists and <b>military</b> <b>people</b> called Majestic 12, again naming Vannevar Bush. Sarbacher was also interviewed in the 1980s and corroborated the information in Smith's memos and correspondence. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Smith granted public interviews, and among other things stated that he had been lent crashed UFO material for analysis by a highly secret U.S. government group which he wouldn't name.|$|E

2500|$|In February 1976, {{the huge}} {{international}} Lockheed bribery scandals came out during public hearings by an investigative commission of the United States Congress. Key political and <b>military</b> <b>people</b> from West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Japan had been bribed by aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin. Prince Bernhard, Inspector-General of the Armed Forces, {{appeared to be}} the Dutch person involved: an inquiry by a Commission of Three showed that he had accepted bribes to the value of 1.1 million guilders to try and persuade Defence to purchase Lockheed aircraft (specifically, the Lockheed P-3 Orion). On 20 August, the Den Uyl cabinet convened a crisis meeting, during which the Commission of Three's conclusions were unanimously confirmed, and earnest discussions ensued over which measures should be taken, and the consequences they would have for Juliana's queenship, who would have threatened to abdicate if her husband were to be prosecuted. A minority of Ministers, especially Henk Vredeling (Defence, PvdA), found that prosecution was necessary, Hans Gruijters (D66) even argued that the monarchy should be relinquished. However, a majority, including PvdA Ministers who were publicly critical about the monarchy, opined that the constitutional establishment could not be endangered, order should return as soon as possible, and feared to lose the vote of the still mostly royalist population during the next elections, in case prosecution were to be pursued. Because Bernhard had, according to the government, damaged the state's interests through his actions, he was honourably discharged from his most prominent military functions by Royal Decree on 9 September 1976; he was also no longer allowed to wear his uniform at official events. According to Cees Fasseur, this was [...] "the last great scandal that shook the monarchy to its foundations." [...] In 1977, the PvdA included in its party platform a statement (Part II, Article 4) that it sought to introduce an elected head of state, thereby henceforth officially striving to abolish the monarchy. The PvdA overwhelmingly won the 1977 elections, but failed to form a new government. It is likely that Juliana would have already abdicated in 1978 if {{there would have been a}} second Den Uyl cabinet.|$|E

60|$|JUNE 2d, 1763, Friedrich left Potsdam for Westphalia; {{got as far}} as Magdeburg that day.

[...] "It is not easy," [...] he said. [...] "Many British officers do not think they have anything to learn. And English people do not like being told things. What could we do? We could hardly send a French officer or so to your headquarters in a tutorial capacity. You have to do things in your own way." [...] When I tried to draw General Castelnau into this dangerous question by suggesting that we might borrow a French general or so, he would say only, [...] "There is only one way to learn war, and that is to make war." [...] When it was too late, in the lift, I thought of the answer to that. There is only one way to make war, and that is by the sacrifice of incapables and the rapid promotion of able men. If old and tried types fail now, new types must be sought. But to do that we want a standard of efficiency. We want a conception of intellectual quality in performance that is still lacking....|$|E
60|$|But {{three things}} were working quietly towards the {{rehabilitation}} of the defensive; firstly the increased range, accuracy and rapidity of rifle fire, with which we may include {{the development of the}} machine gun; secondly the increasing use of the spade, and thirdly the invention of barbed wire.

In the thinly populated war region of South Africa the difficulties of forcing entrenched positions were largely met by outflanking, the Boers had only a limited amount of barbed wire and could be held down in their trenches by shrapnel, and even at the beginning of the present war there can be little doubt that we and our Allies were still largely unprepared for the full possibilities of trench warfare, we attempted a war of manoeuvres, war at about the grade to which war had been brought in 1898, and it was the Germans who first brought the war up to date by entrenching upon the Aisne. We had, of course, a few aeroplanes at that time, but they were used chiefly as a sort of accessory cavalry for scouting; our artillery was light and our shell almost wholly shrapnel.|$|E
