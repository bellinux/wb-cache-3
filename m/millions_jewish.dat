50|$|During the 1960s, HIAS rescued Jews from Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya and {{arranged}} with Morocco's King Hassan for {{the evacuation of}} his country's huge Jewish community to France and, eventually, Israel.

5000|$|Adolf Eichmann, {{one of the}} {{principal}} architects of the Holocaust, gave a figure of 6 <b>million</b> <b>Jewish</b> victims. This number was also used in July 1945 by Abba Kovner and then later by the first post-war trials of perpetrators. The Yad Vashem Museum writes that [...] "there is no precise figure for the number of Jews killed", but has been able to find documentation of more than three <b>million</b> names of <b>Jewish</b> victims killed.|$|R

In August 1914 the German imperial army destroyed the city of Kalisz, chasing out tens of thousands of its Polish citizens.|$|R
5000|$|This is an {{outrageous}} and shoddy attempt by D. James Kennedy to trivialize {{the horrors of}} the Holocaust. Hitler did not need Darwin to devise his heinous plan to exterminate the Jewish people. Trivializing the Holocaust comes from either ignorance at best or, at worst, a mendacious attempt to score political points in the culture war on the backs of six <b>million</b> <b>Jewish</b> victims and others who died {{at the hands of the}} Nazis.|$|R

50|$|Following the war, Berihah ("escape"), an {{organization}} of former partisans and ghetto fighters was primarily responsible for smuggling Jews from Poland and Eastern Europe to the Italian ports from which they traveled to Mandatory Palestine. Despite British efforts to curb the illegal immigration, during the 14 years of its operation, 110,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine. In 1945 reports of the Holocaust with its 6 <b>million</b> <b>Jewish</b> killed, caused many Jews in Palestine to turn openly against the British Mandate, and illegal immigration escalated rapidly as many Holocaust survivors joined the Aliyah.|$|R

5000|$|In The Institutes of Biblical Law he {{uses the}} 1967 work Judaism and the Vatican by Léon de Poncins {{as a source for}} Paul Rassinier's figure of 1.2 <b>million</b> <b>Jewish</b> deaths during the Holocaust, and the claim that Raul Hilberg {{calculated}} the number at 896,292, and further asserts that very many of these died of epidemics. He calls the charge of 6 <b>million</b> <b>Jewish</b> deaths [...] "false witness" [...] against Germany. In 2000, Rushdoony stated concerning this passage in his Institutes [...] "It was not my purpose to enter a debate over numbers, whether millions were killed, or tens of millions, an area which must be left to others with expertise in such matters. My point then and now is that in all such matters what the Ninth Commandment requires is the truth, not exaggeration, irrespective of the cause one seeks to serve." [...] Carl R. Trueman, Professor of Historical Theology and Church History at Westminster Theological Seminary wrote in 2009 regarding the passage and Rushdoony's Holocaust denial:His sources are atrocious, secondhand, and unverified; that he held this position speaks volumes about this appalling incompetence as a historian, and one can only speculate as to why he held the position from a moral perspective... He deals with the matter under the issue of the ninth commandment and, ironically breaches it himself in his presentation of the matter.|$|R

Harmatz told The Observer in 1998 that the goal of Nakam was the death of as many Germans as possible, with the group planning [...] "to kill six million Germans, one for every Jew slaughtered by the Germans", acknowledging that the effort [...] "was revenge, quite simply. Were we not entitled to our revenge, too?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The Columbia Encyclopedia defines [...] "Holocaust" [...] as [...] "name {{given to}} the period of {{persecution}} and extermination of European Jews by Nazi Germany".

They were the only other group that the Nazis systematically killed in gas chambers alongside the Jews." ...|$|R
50|$|The League {{investigated}} the proposal, hoping {{to buy an}} area of 28000 km2 of agricultural land for 75,000 Jews fleeing Europe. The tract in question was that of Connor, Doherty and Durack Limited, including Auvergne Station, Newry Station, and Argyle Downs, and extending between the Ord and Victoria Rivers. Under the plan, an initial 500-600 pioneers would arrive to construct basic necessities for the settlement such as homes, irrigation works, and a power station, followed {{by the arrival of}} the main body of immigrants. Ravitch in his report to the League promoted a bigger number than Steinberg, suggesting the area could accommodate a <b>million</b> <b>Jewish</b> refugees.|$|R
5000|$|Jerrold Nadler {{explained}} his view in 2012 that [...] "the suffering and terrible injustices visited upon Jewish {{refugees in the}} Middle East needs to be acknowledged. It is simply wrong to recognize the rights of Palestinian refugees without recognizing the rights of nearly 1 <b>million</b> <b>Jewish</b> refugees who suffered terrible outrages {{at the hands of}} their former compatriots." [...] Critics have suggested the campaign is simply an anti-Palestinian [...] "tactic", which Michael Fischbach explains as [...] "a tactic to help the Israeli government deflect Palestinian refugee claims in any final Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, claims that include Palestinian refugees' demand for the 'right of return' to their pre-1948 homes in Israel." ...|$|R
5000|$|The early postwar {{calculations}} {{ranged from}} about 4.2 to 4.5 million by Gerald Reitlinger, and 5.1 million from Raul Hilberg, to 5.95 million from Jacob Lestschinsky. Yehuda Bauer and Robert Rozett in the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust estimate 5.59-5.86 million. A study led by Wolfgang Benz suggests 5.29 to 6.20 million. These estimates derive from comparing census records from {{before and after}} the war as well as the surviving German documentation on deportations and killings. Martin Gilbert arrived at a [...] "minimum estimate" [...] of over 5.75 <b>million</b> <b>Jewish</b> victims. Lucy S. Dawidowicz used the pre-war census figures to estimate that 5.934 million Jews died.|$|R
5000|$|The Holocaust {{began in}} 1933 prior to World War II in Germany when the Nazi regime under Adolf Hitler's rule {{attempted}} {{to wipe out}} the [...] "inferior" [...] people of the country. This primarily included people of the Jewish culture, but also included Gypsies, the disabled, some Slavic people, Jehovah's Witnesses, and homosexuals. By the end of the Holocaust in 1945, more than 6 <b>million</b> <b>Jewish</b> people had been killed. Of these 6 million that had been killed, 1.5 million were children between ages zero and eighteen. By killing off many Jewish children, the Nazi regime hoped to exterminate the core and root of the Jewish culture.|$|R
5000|$|Many Jewish {{families}} {{began to}} emigrate {{out of the}} Russian Empire in order to escape the conscription obligations. Due to this the government began to employ Khappers or “bounty-hunters” who would kidnap Jewish children and turn {{them over to the}} government for conscription. Unfortunately, it became known that “the khappers were not scrupulous about adhering to the minimum age of 12 and frequently impressed children as young as 8.” “By the time the empire collapsed, around 1.5 <b>million</b> <b>Jewish</b> soldiers fulfilled what was often seen as a highly burdensome and intrusive obligation.” [...] At first many Jews were hesitant, but by 1880 Russian Jews were fully integrated into the Russian military.|$|R
2500|$|In October 2017, Farage {{asserted}} in an LBC radio {{appearance that}} the [...] "Jewish lobby" [...] in the United States was more concerning {{to him than}} Russian interference in American politics, saying: [...] "There are other very powerful lobbies in the United States of America, and the Jewish lobby, with its links with the Israeli government, {{is one of those}} strong voices...There are about 6 <b>million</b> <b>Jewish</b> people living in America, so as a percentage it's quite small, but in terms of influence it's quite big." [...] Farage's remarks were condemned by the Campaign Against Antisemitism and the Anti-Defamation League, which said that Farage's comment [...] "plays into deep-seated anti-Semitic tropes" [...] and was fuel for extremist conspiracy theories.|$|R

5000|$|The {{total number}} of Jews {{worldwide}} is difficult to assess because the definition of [...] "who is a Jew" [...] is problematic; not all Jews identify themselves as Jewish, and some who identify as Jewish are not considered so by other Jews.

The latest available data is from the World Jewish Population Survey of 2002 and the Jewish Year Calendar (2005). In 2002, according to the Jewish Population Survey, there were 13.3 million Jews around the world.
