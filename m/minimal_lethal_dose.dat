5000|$|The {{potentially}} {{lethal protein}} {{component in the}} crude venom of T. draco is a 105 kDa polypeptide which is called Dracotoxin. The crude venom of T. draco {{has been shown to}} have membrane depolarizing and haemolytic characteristics. Those characteristics could be retraced to said single protein component. The depolarisation effect however could not be explained by well-established approaches. Neither does the depolarisation effect take place through Na+ or K+-channels nor through Na+-K+-ATPase activity.⁠The weever sting is often followed by first ischemic and subsequently hyperemic effects in the tissue surrounding the sting. These effects might be related to the high concentrations of histamines and catecholamines found in the venom.⁠⁠⁠While Church & Hodgson (2002) suggest a cholinesterase activity of the toxin itself, Haavaldsen & Fonnum (1963) interpreted their finding of a high concentration of cholinesterase in the venom as a sign for a cholinergic mechanism in the production of the venom because cholinesterase activity hasn’t yet been described in the venoms of the animal kingdom.⁠ As Russel & Emery (1960) stated, the toxin extract of T. draco has a greyish colour but is clear in its appearance. It is said to have a “fishy taste” and “ammoniacal odor”.

40|$|A micro {{capillary}} agar-gel diffusion {{system for}} the detection of botulinal toxin in foods and cultures was developed and evaluated. Toxins types A, B, and E, produced in culture broth with and without added trypsin, and type E toxin, produced in inoculated canned clams, were tested with this system and with the mouse bioassay procedure. With nontrypsinized toxin, the capillary diffusion system detected as little as 100 <b>minimal</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> (MLD) per ml but was effective only at higher levels, 106 to 1. 5 × 107 MLD/ml, when used with trypsinized toxin. The inability to detect lower levels of trypsinized toxin was due to thioglycolate present in the medium used to produce toxin. Evidently, trypsinization of toxin produces polypeptides still held together by disulfide bonds. Cleavage of these bonds by reduction with thioglycolate reduces the sensitivity of the capillary method. Trypsinized toxin produced in broth without thioglycolate was detected as readily as nontrypsinized toxin. Toxin was detected in canned clams containing as low as 100 MLD/ml.

40|$|Bacteriophage therapy of {{bacterial}} infections has received renewed attention {{owing to the}} increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. A side effect of many antibiotics {{as well as of}} phage therapy with lytic phage is the release of cell wall components, e. g., endotoxins of gram-negative bacteria, which mediate the general pathological aspects of septicemia. Here we explored an alternative strategy by using genetically engineered nonreplicating, nonlytic phage to combat an experimental Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. An export protein gene of the P. aeruginosa filamentous phage Pf 3 was replaced with a restriction endonuclease gene. This rendered the Pf 3 variant (Pf 3 R) nonreplicative and concomitantly prevented the release of the therapeutic agent from the target cell. The Pf 3 R phage efficiently killed a wild-type host in vitro, while endotoxin release was kept to a minimum. Treatment of P. aeruginosa infections of mice with Pf 3 R or with a replicating lytic phage resulted in comparable survival rates upon challenge with a <b>minimal</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> of 3. However, the survival rate after phage therapy with Pf 3 R was significantly higher than that with the lytic phage upon challenge with a <b>minimal</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> of 5. This higher survival rate correlated with a reduced inflammatory response elicited by Pf 3 R treatment relative to that with the lytic phage. Therefore, this study suggests that the increased survival rate of Pf 3 R-treated mice could result from reduced endotoxin release. Thus, the use of a nonreplicating modified phage for the delivery of genes encoding proteins toxic to bacterial pathogens may open up a new avenue in antimicrobial therapy...|$|E

According to the most recent theories on the pathogenesis of tetanus, spasms are caused by a disturbance of the inhibitory synapses [26, 27].

Is it because of their influence upon complement, opsonin, or the leucocyte itself, or some special one function that determines the ability to ingest bacteria? Only further work can definitely settle this question and also determine whether or not such an analysis would be of practical importance in a rational development of chemotherapy. The ideal chemotherapeutic agent may be one that has an in vivo bactericidal potency and a negligible or stimulatory phagocytic action in doses non-lethal for the experimental animal. However difficult such a drug may be to find, it seems unlikely that the ultimate success in chemotherapy will be so simple. Again, it is conceivable that a secondary action of a drug, although leucocytotropic and not bacteriotropic, may bring about conditions in the animal body that will enable it to throw off the invading organism. Or finally, a drug compatible with the forces necessary to the host's defense and possessing in vivo bactericidal action to a greater or less degree may be the chemical sought for, the goal toward which we should strive, to achieve a rational chemotherapy for infectious diseases...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the present work were to establish the <b>minimal</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> of the selective agent to determine the type and concentration of appropriate antibiotics {{for the elimination of}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens inoculated explants, without interfering with the regenerative potential of the E. camaldulensis cotyledonary explants. Non-transformed explants were cultivated in medium supplemented with kanamycin. The results showed that the antibiotic was suitable for the selection of transformed cells in the concentration of 9 mg L- 1 as it inhibited the growth of non-transformed cells. Cotyledons infected with A. tumefaciens were cultivated in MS N/ 2 medium supplemented with BAP, ANA, Km and cefotaxime or AugmentinÒ. The highest average of regenerated shoots by explant (5, 4) was observed in the presence of 300 mg L- 1 of AugmentinÒ / 15 days, followed by 150 mg L- 1 / 15 days and 100 mg L- 1 / 30 days...|$|E
40|$|The {{amino acid}} {{sequence}} of a presynaptic neurotoxin, agkistrodotoxin (ATX) isolated from the venom of Agkistrodon halys Pallas, was determined by automated Edman degradation and the carboxypeptidase digestion of the S-carboxymethylated ATX and by sequence analyses of peptides produced with cyanogen bromide cleavage and with trypsin or staphylococcal V 8 protease digestion of the S-carboxymethylated ATX. ATX consists of 122 amino acid residues, including the histidine residue and 14 half-cystine residues. The {{amino acid sequence}} of ATX {{is very similar to}} those of toxic phospholipases and the phospholipase submits of presynaptic neurotoxins from snake venoms. The residues responsible for the toxic activity of the presynaptic neurotoxins are discussed. The venom of Agkistrodon halys Pallas, a pit viper, which lives in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, China, contains two kinds of neurotoxin (1). One of them, agkistrodotoxin (ATX), has a potent neurotoxicity of <b>minimal</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (i. p.) 0. 055 //g/g in mouse, together with phospholipase activity, and it inhibits neuromuscular transmission b...|$|E
40|$|Intracellular solutes were {{released}} from growing or resting cells of Bacillus megaterium {{as a consequence}} of hexachlorophene treatment. The effect was dose dependent, with the optimum at a concentration about sevenfold greater than the <b>minimal</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose.</b> The effects of pH and temperature on the leakage process also were inconsistent with the killing effects of the drug. The types of materials released appeared to be the same with or without hexachlorophene treatment. The released materials were small molecules which apparently derived from preexisting ribonucleic acid and protein, but not from deoxyribonucleic acid. Compared to the effects of other representative surface-active agents and other bis-phenols, hexachlorophene was superior in ability to cause leakage of intracellular materials. Different microorganisms varied in their susceptibility to hexachlorophene, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a paracolon isolate the most resistant of the vegetative cells examined. It was concluded that the release of intracellular solutes was an effect secondary to the lethal event and presumably arose from hexachlorophene-mediated stimulation of degradative enzymes...|$|E

We conducted experiments to compare <b>minimal</b> infective <b>dose,</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> 50 and bacterial shedding for six V. aestuarianus strains. Whatever the strain used, mortality was induced in juvenile oysters by intramuscular injection and reached 90 – 100 % of mortality within 5  days. Moreover, bacterial shedding was comparable among strains and reached its maximum after 20  h (≈ 10 EXP 5 bacteria/mL/animal). Similarly, our first estimations of <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> 50 were comparable among strains (minimal infective dose around 0. 4  ×  10 EXP 5 bacteria/mL and LD 50 around 10 EXP 5 bacteria/mL) by using seawater containing freshly shed bacteria. These results indicate that, at least with these criteria, despite V. aestuarianus strains genetic diversity, the disease process is similar. The strains isolated after the apparent re-emergence of the bacteria in 2011, do not present a more acute virulence phenotype than the reference strains isolated between 2002 and 2007. Finally, our study provides original and noteworthy data indicating that infected oysters shed bacteria at a level above the threshold of LD 50 a few days before they die, meaning that infection is expected to spread in a susceptible population...|$|R
40|$|Prophylactic {{administration}} of recombinant human interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) in mice enhanced survival and produced complete recovery from an otherwise lethal acute bacterial infection. IL- 2 was administered {{as a single}} intraperitoneal or intravenous bolus dose to CDI mice 18 h before challenge with a <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> of a clinical isolate of Escherichia coli type O 2 (<b>minimal</b> 100 % <b>lethal</b> <b>dose,</b> 6 X 10 (7) CFU per mouse). At IL- 2 dosages of 7 X 10 (6) U/kg, 90 % of treated CDI mice survived as compared to 0 % for the excipient buffer control animals (P less than 0. 001). This protective effect was also demonstrable in immune-deficient beige mice. The IL- 2 effect was dose dependent; protection was consistently observed in mice pretreated with IL- 2 at doses ranging from 1. 8 X 10 (6) to 7 X 10 (6) U/kg. However, at 3. 5 X 10 (5) U/kg the protective effect was more variable. The route of {{administration of}} IL- 2 was shown {{to play an important}} role; when IL- 2 and challenge bacteria were given by the same route (either intravenously or intraperitoneally), protection was readily observable, but when IL- 2 and challenge bacteria were given by different routes, little or no protective effect was observed. The protective effect was fully inducible as early as 1 h after IL- 2 administration and was effective against various strains of gram-negative bacteria, indicating that the probable mode of action represents control of the establishment of infection by increased activity of the nonspecific host defense mechanisms. The IL- 2 effect was abrogated by the administration of carrageenan, suggesting a possible role of macrophages. These data demonstrate that IL- 2 may be a potentially useful adjunct for the prophylaxis of bacterial infections in both clinical and veterinary medicine...|$|R
