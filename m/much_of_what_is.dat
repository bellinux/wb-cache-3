5|$|<b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> {{known of}} Euler's {{religious}} beliefs can be deduced from his Letters to a German Princess and an earlier work, Rettung der Göttlichen Offenbahrung Gegen die Einwürfe der Freygeister (Defense of the Divine Revelation against the Objections of the Freethinkers). These works show that Euler was a devout Christian who believed the Bible to be inspired; the Rettung was primarily {{an argument for}} the divine inspiration of scripture.|$|E
5|$|<b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> {{known of}} the event {{is based on a}} month-long {{preliminary}} hearing held afterward, generally known as the Spicer hearings.

5|$|Historically in Lancashire, Wigan during {{classical}} antiquity was in {{the territory}} of the Brigantes, an ancient Celtic tribe that ruled <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now northern England. The Brigantes were subjugated in the Roman conquest of Britain during the 1st century, and it is asserted that the Roman settlement of Coccium was established where Wigan lies. Wigan {{is believed to have been}} incorporated as a borough in 1246 following the issue of a charter by King Henry III of England. At the end of the Middle Ages it was one of four boroughs in Lancashire established by Royal charter.|$|E
5|$|Humans are {{not alone}} in {{suffering}} from lead's effects; plants and animals are also affected by lead toxicity to varying degrees depending on species. Animals experience many of the same effects of lead exposure as humans do, such as abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and behavioral changes such as increased aggression. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> known about human lead toxicity and its effects is derived from animal studies. Animals are used to test the effects of treatments, such as chelating agents, and to provide information on the pathophysiology of lead, such as how it is absorbed and distributed in the body.|$|E

5|$|The Austrian Netherlands was a {{territory}} with its capital at Brussels which covered <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> today Belgium and Luxembourg during the Early Modern period. In 1714, the territory, {{which had been}} ruled by Spain, was ceded to Austria {{as part of the}} Treaty of Rastatt which ended the War of the Spanish Succession.

5|$|The assassins, the {{key members}} of the clandestine network, and the key Serbian {{military}} conspirators who were still alive were arrested, tried, convicted and punished. Those who were arrested in Bosnia were tried in Sarajevo in October 1914. The other conspirators were arrested and tried before a Serbian court on the French-controlled Salonika Front in 1916–1917 on unrelated false charges; Serbia executed three of the top military conspirators. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> known about the assassinations comes from these two trials and related records.|$|E
5|$|The most {{extensive}} {{account of the}} life of Domitian to survive was written by the historian Suetonius, who was born during the reign of Vespasian, and published his works under Emperor Hadrian (117–138). His De Vita Caesarum is the source of <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> known of Domitian. Although his text is predominantly negative, it neither exclusively condemns nor praises Domitian, and asserts that his rule started well, but gradually declined into terror. The biography is problematic however, in that it appears to contradict itself with regards to Domitian's rule and personality, at the same time presenting him as a conscientious, moderate man, and as a decadent libertine.|$|E

5|$|Attempts {{to catalog}} Atlantic hurricanes {{in the first}} half of the 19th century began as early as 1855, when Andrés Poey {{compiled}} information on just over 400 tropical cyclones from 1493 to 1855. Poey's work serves as the basis for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> currently known about historical Atlantic tropical cyclones. He identified four distinct tropical systems that developed in 1842 (six events are listed, though two concern the same storm), plus another in November that was later deemed extratropical in nature. In his 1963 book, Early American Hurricanes, 1492–1870, weather researcher David M. Ludlum discussed, in greater detail, six significant tropical cyclones that impacted the United States in 1842. As the season falls outside the scope of the Atlantic hurricane database (1851 onward) and its associated reanalysis project, records are regarded as incomplete.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{wildlife}} {{importance of the}} area, <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now the SSSI has been protected in nature reserves, starting in 1912 when Charles Rothschild bought Blakeney Point and donated it to the National Trust, which has managed it since. A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites (Snettisham, Titchwell, Holkham, Morston Quay, Blakeney and Cley) found that 39per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as {{the main purpose of}} their visit. The 7.7million day visitors and 5.5million who made overnight stays in the area in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122million, and created the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs. Titchwell Marsh (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds), Cley Marshes (Norfolk Wildlife Trust) and Holkham National Nature Reserve each attract 100,000 or more visitors annually. The SSSI ownership outside the listed areas is a mixture of private land and areas owned by the National Trust or wildfowling associations which are not actively managed as nature reserves.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, much of North America had been claimed by European countries. Spain had claimed Florida {{as well as}} modern-day Mexico {{and much of the}} southwestern part of the continent. The {{northern}} and central Atlantic coast was claimed by Britain, and New France comprised <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now eastern Canada as well as the central Illinois Country. The French feared that their territory was vulnerable to the expansionist aims of its neighbors. In 1681, French nobleman Robert Cavelier de La Salle launched an expedition down the Mississippi River from New France, at first believing he would find a path to the Pacific Ocean. Instead, La Salle found a route to the Gulf of Mexico. Although Hernando De Soto had explored and claimed this area for Spain 140years before, on April 9, 1682, La Salle claimed the Mississippi River valley for French king Louis XIV, naming the territory Louisiana in his honor.|$|E

5|$|<b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now MD291 was {{constructed}} as two different highways. MD291 proper ran from MD290 near Chesterville through Millington to the Delaware state line. MD447 connected US213 in Chestertown and MD290 in Chesterville, using MD291's current corridor from Chestertown to Morgnec {{and a more}} northerly path from Morgnec to Chesterville. MD291 {{was constructed}} as a concrete road from Millington to the Delaware state line in 1929 and 1930; the portion of River Road on which MD290 runs concurrently with MD291 was paved in concrete {{in the same time}} span. The concrete highway was extended west from Millington to Mills Branch in two sections, the eastern part completed in 1933 and the western segment built in 1934 and 1935. Kent County included the portion of River Road between MD290 and Mills Branch as its top priority in the post-war construction program; that segment was surfaced and brought into the state highway system as an extension of MD291 in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{the best}} ecologically studied {{seamount}} {{in the world}} is Davidson Seamount, with six major expeditions recording over 60,000 species observations. The contrast between the seamount and the surrounding area was well-marked. One of the primary ecological havens on the seamount is its deep sea coral garden, and many of the specimens noted were over a century old. Following the expansion of knowledge on the seamount there was extensive support to make it a marine sanctuary, a motion that was granted in 2008 as part of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> known about seamounts ecologically is based on observations from Davidson. Another such seamount is Bowie Seamount, which has also been declared a marine protected area by Canada for its ecological richness.|$|E
5|$|Spain and {{subsequently}} Mexico controlled <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now the western United States until the Mexican–American War, including {{the entire state}} of Texas. After Texas joined the United States, the native Tejanos living in the state began culturally developing separately from their neighbors to the south, and remained culturally distinct from other Texans. Central to the evolution of early Tejano music was the blend of traditional Mexican forms such as mariachi and the corrido, and Continental European styles introduced by German and Czech settlers in the late 19th century. In particular, the accordion was adopted by Tejano folk musicians around the start of the 20th century, and it became a popular instrument for amateur musicians in Texas and Northern Mexico.|$|E
