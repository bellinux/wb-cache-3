5|$|In all Zveno configurations, all {{aircraft}} were piloted and all {{had their}} engines running — {{it was expected}} that the combined thrust would more than offset the weight and actually improve the performance of the mothership compared to conventional bombers. The fighters were rigidly attached via pyramid-shaped <b>metal</b> <b>frames,</b> with both latches controlled by the fighter pilots. (On Zveno-1, the front latches were controlled by the bomber crew, while the back latch was controlled by the pilot; this was changed to all-pilot control in the next version). The original design included umbilical fuel lines which permitted the fighters to use fuel from the bomber while attached, although this was not fully implemented in practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of skyscrapers {{was made possible}} by technological improvements {{during the middle of the}} 19th century. One of these developments was the iron framed building. Masonry buildings supported their internal floors through their walls, but the taller the building, the thicker the walls had to become, particularly at the base. In the 1860s, French engineers experimented with using built-up plate girders made of wrought iron to construct buildings supported by internal <b>metal</b> <b>frames.</b> These frames were stronger than traditional masonry and permitted much thinner walls. The methodology was extensively described in engineering journals and was initially used to build warehouses.|$|E
5|$|Using these <b>metal</b> <b>frames</b> for taller buildings, however, meant exposing them to {{increased}} wind pressure. As a consequence, protective wind bracing {{had to be}} introduced, enabled {{by the work of}} Augustin-Jean Fresnel who produced equations for calculating the loads and moments on larger buildings. Metal-framed buildings were also vulnerable to fire and required special fireproofing. French engineers had made advances in this area in the early 19th century, and major breakthroughs came with the work of architect Peter Wight in the 1860s. Spurred on by the catastrophic fires in Chicago in 1871 and Boston in 1872, his findings were turned into a wide variety of patented fireproofing products during the 1870s.|$|E

5|$|Elemental bromine is toxic {{and causes}} {{chemical}} burns on human flesh. Inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract, causing coughing, choking, and shortness of breath, and death if inhaled in large enough amounts. Chronic exposure {{may lead to}} frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health. As a strong oxidising agent, bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Caution is required when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong <b>metal</b> <b>frames.</b> The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States has set a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for bromine at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1ppm. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of TWA 0.1ppm and a short-term limit of 0.3ppm. The exposure to bromine immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 3ppm. Bromine is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{electronic}} keyboards {{in the early}} 1970s, the key switches were individual switches inserted into holes in <b>metal</b> <b>frames.</b> These keyboards cost from 80 to 120USD and were used in mainframe data terminals. The most popular switch types were reed switches (contacts enclosed in a vacuum in a glass capsule, affected by a magnet mounted on the switch plunger).|$|E

50|$|Boulton & Paul {{developed}} steel-framed aircraft {{under their}} designer John Dudley North. The {{first was the}} Boulton & Paul P.10 which used steel tubes rolled from sheet metal. It was exhibited - but not flown - at the Paris Air Show in 1919. Official interest in <b>metal</b> <b>frame</b> designs led to an order of a single Boulton & Paul Bolton, a twin-engine bomber design. In the same period Boulton & Paul produced another <b>metal</b> <b>framed</b> design, the Bodmin, with its engines in the fuselage. North believed that a <b>metal</b> <b>frame</b> could be 10% lighter than an equivalent wooden frame.|$|R
25|$|They {{are created}} in local {{workshops}} and {{transported to the}} event by their creators. One of the main problems aspiring participants have is obtaining sponsorship {{for the creation of}} the monumental pieces. The creation of the pieces is expensive. Smaller figures can cost on average of 10,000 pesos to create. For a figure of over four meters, the cost is between 50,000 and 70,000 pesos as <b>metal</b> <b>frames</b> need to be used along with paper, paint and other materials.|$|E
25|$|In many {{developed}} countries, electronic waste processing usually first involves {{dismantling the}} equipment into various parts (<b>metal</b> <b>frames,</b> power supplies, circuit boards, plastics), often by hand, but increasingly by automated shredding equipment. A typical {{example is the}} NADIN electronic waste processing plant in Novi Iskar, Bulgaria—the largest facility {{of its kind in}} Eastern Europe. The advantages of this process are the human's ability to recognize and save working and repairable parts, including chips, transistors, RAM, etc. The disadvantage is that the labor is cheapest in countries with the lowest health and safety standards.|$|E
25|$|The {{very first}} modern {{aquarium}} {{made of glass}} {{was developed in the}} 19th century by Robert Warrington. During the Victorian age, glass aquariums commonly had slate or steel bottoms, which allowed them to be heated underneath by an open-flame heat source. These aquariums had the glass panels attached with <b>metal</b> <b>frames</b> and sealed with putty. Metal-framed aquariums were still available until the mid-1960s, when the modern, silicone-sealed style replaced them. Acrylic aquariums first became available to the public in the 1970s. Laminated glass is sometimes used, which combines the advantages of both glass and acrylic.|$|E

25|$|In the Victorian {{era in the}} United Kingdom, {{a common}} design for the home {{aquarium}} was a glass front with the other sides made of wood (made watertight with a pitch coating). The bottom would be made of slate and heated from below. More advanced systems soon began to be introduced, along with tanks of glass in <b>metal</b> <b>frames.</b> During {{the latter half of}} the 19th century, a variety of aquarium designs were explored, such as hanging the aquarium on a wall, mounting it as part of a window, or even combining it with a birdcage.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{into the}} {{development}} of powered flight, some manufacturers were beginning to consider the use of metal in airframes to replace wood. Metal structures, even fabric-covered <b>metal</b> <b>frames,</b> offered greater robustness for handling and transportation as well as better resistance to tropical climates, and some designers could see the possibilities of metal skinning, stressed or not, for aerodynamically-clean cantilever wings and advanced monocoque fuselages. There was a realisation too, that mild steel, familiar from bicycle manufacture but with a low strength-to-weight ratio, {{was not going to}} be the material of choice once the problems of joining aluminium alloy members together and preventing their corrosion had been solved. Vickers in the UK were one of the first to make steel-framed and sparred aircraft that flew, with their series of R.E.P-type monoplanes no.s 1-8 produced between 1911 and 1913. In Germany, Junkers produced the first true all-metal (for years, aircraft with fabric-clad <b>metal</b> <b>frames</b> were described as all-metal, but the Junkers was steel-skinned as well) aircraft, the Junkers J.1, flown in 1915. Bristol's first draft designs for metal aircraft date from 1914, but it was not until the increase of aircraft production during the First World War began to put pressure on the supply of high-grade timber that there was official interest. During 1916 Bristol's designer, Frank Barnwell submitted a design for a metal two-seat reconnaissance aircraft, the M.R.1 (M.R. for Metal Reconnaissance) and gained a contract for two evaluation aircraft.|$|E
25|$|This {{festival is}} held {{annually}} and features colorful lantern floats called nebuta which are pulled {{through the streets}} of Central Aomori. This festival is held from about August 2–7 every year. This event attracts millions of visitors. During this festival, 20 large nebuta floats are paraded through the streets near Aomori JR rail station. These floats are constructed of wooden bases and <b>metal</b> <b>frames.</b> Japanese papers, called washi, are painted onto the frames. These amazing floats are finished off with the historical figures or kabuki being painted on the paper. These floats can take up to a year to complete. There is a dance portion of this festival. There are haneto dancers and they wear special costumes for this dance. Everyone is welcome to purchase their own haneto costume that they may too join in on the fun (Mishima, Aomori Nebuta Festival).|$|E

25|$|In the {{original}} Tube design, trains passing through close fitting tunnels act as pistons to create air pressure gradients between stations. This pressure difference drives ventilation between platforms {{and the surface}} exits through the passenger foot network. This system depends on adequate cross sectional area of the airspace above the passengers’ heads in the foot tunnels and escalators, where laminar airflow {{is proportional to the}} fourth power of the radius, the Hagen–Poiseuille equation. It also depends on an absence of turbulence in the tunnel headspace. In many stations the ventilation system is now ineffective because of alterations that reduce tunnel diameters and increase turbulence. An example is Green Park tube station, where false ceiling panels attached to <b>metal</b> <b>frames</b> have been installed that reduce the above-head airspace diameter by more than half in many parts. This has the effect of reducing laminar airflow by some 94%.|$|E
25|$|Aquaria {{became more}} widely popular as houses had an {{electricity}} supply after World War I. Electricity allowed artificial lighting, {{as well as}} aeration, filtration, and heating of the water. Initially, amateur aquarists kept native fish (with the exception of goldfish); the availability of exotic species from overseas further increased {{the popularity of the}} aquarium. Jugs made from a variety of materials were used to import fish from overseas, with a bicycle foot pump for aeration. Plastic shipping bags were introduced in the 1950s, making it easier to ship fish. The eventual availability of air freight allowed fish to be successfully imported from distant regions. In the 1960s, <b>metal</b> <b>frames</b> made marine aquaria almost impossible due to corrosion, but the development of tar and silicone sealant allowed the first all-glass aquaria made by Martin Horowitz in Los Angeles, CA. The frames remained, however, though purely for aesthetic reasons.|$|E
25|$|Homebuilt {{aircraft}} are generally small, one to four-seat sportsplanes which employ simple methods of construction. Fabric-covered wood or <b>metal</b> <b>frames</b> and plywood {{are common in}} the aircraft structure, but increasingly, fiberglass and other composites as well as full aluminum construction techniques are being used, techniques first pioneered by Hugo Junkers {{as far back as}} the late World War I era. Engines are most often the same as, or similar to, the engines used in certified aircraft (such as Lycoming, Continental, Rotax, and Jabiru). A minority of homebuilts use converted automobile engines, with Volkswagen air-cooled flat-4s, Subaru-based liquid-cooled engines, Mazda Wankel and Chevrolet Corvair six-cylinder engines being most common. The use of automotive engines helps to reduce costs, but many builders prefer dedicated aircraft engines, which are perceived to have better performance and reliability. Other engines that have been used include chainsaw and motorcycle engines.|$|E

25|$|The export range, from 1948 {{were the}} OPS2, OPS3 and OPS4. They also {{featured}} the O600 engine and synchromesh gearbox as introduced, but air brakes were optional. The OPS2 shared the PS2's 17ft 6in wheelbase, although the frames, springs and axles were heavier duty than their home market equivalents, bodies {{could be as}} long as 29ft 3in where laws permitted, the OPS3 was introduced {{at the same time}} as the OPS2 but had a 19ft wheelbase for bodies up to 31ft long. This variant would not have met UK turning circle requirements when the new 30ft length was legalised in 1950. Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ), the Irish state transport undertaking uniquely took Tigers of both PS2/13 and OPS3 type, these become the last vehicles of over 300 to be numbered in the P series that had started with Dublin United Transport's first Tiger in 1935. Walter Alexander took some OPS2 coaches as well as PS2s but these are believed to have been a frustrated export order. The OPS4, had a 21ft 6in wheelbase for a bodied length of 35ft, Duple produced a batch of fifteen LOPS4/3 with Park Royal <b>metal</b> <b>frames</b> in 1949 for coach operators in Buenos Aires and a single coach to the same outline for Gibraltar motorways. Production of the 'overseas' Tiger concentrated in the 1950s on the OPS4/5 variant with exposed radiator, O680 engine, air brakes and Pneumocyclic gearbox as standard, the final (post 1967) versions were coded OPS4A/15 following updates in the Titan range and a rationalisation of nomenclature and components. The last Tiger OPS4s were delivered to South African fleets in 1970, some of these were still working at the turn of the century.|$|E
