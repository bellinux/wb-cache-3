40|$|Low-molecular-weight {{organic acids}} play an {{important}} role in the mobilization of soil phosphorus (P). The molybdate blue colorimetric method, based on the formation of P molybdenum blue compound, is commonly used for analysis of phosphate in soil and environmental samples. However, some organic acids can act as a ligand to bond with molybdenum acid, which subsequently interfere with the colorimetric reaction. The recoveries of P were inhibited by the addition of oxalic (> 2 mM) and citric acids (> 3 mM) both in standard P solutions and soil extracts, but formic and <b>maleic</b> <b>acids</b> did not interfere with the P determination. The inhibition of oxalic and citric acids on P recovery remained even at higher level of P (up to 100 姠P 100 ml- 1) though such interferences decreased by increasing P concentration. Comparison between oxalic and citric acids revealed the more pronounced interference by the addition of oxalic acid. The results suggested that the interference of organic acids with P determination is related to the types of organic acids and the ratio of organic acid ligands to P anions in the solutions. Thus, analysis of P using the molybdate blue colorimetric method should be undertaken cautiously in the presence of relative strong ligands like oxalic and citric acids.

The present study focuses on the kinetics and mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of sunscreen agent 2 -phenylbenzimidazole- 5 -sulfonic acid (PBSA) in illuminated TiO 2 suspensions. Photocatalysis of PBSA was systematically investigated under different process conditions and water matrices. Experimental results demonstrated that PBSA photocatalytic reactions followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. Radical scavenging experiments indicated that hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) is the predominant reactive species responsible for an appreciable degradation of PBSA. Second-order rate constant of PBSA-HO center dot reaction {{was determined to be}} 5. 8 x 10 (9) M- 1 s(- 1) by competition kinetics method. Major intermediates included hydroxylated products, benzamide, hydroxylated benzamidine, hydroxylated 2 -pheny- 1 H-benzimidazole as well as phenylimidazolecarboxylic derivatives which were elucidated by means of high performance liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) technique. Four carboxylic acids, oxalic, malonic, acetic and <b>maleic</b> <b>acids,</b> were detected during PBSA photocatalysis by HPLC-UV analysis.

40|$|Abstract — The {{unimolecular}} rearrangement {{chemistry of}} molecular ions ncountered in mass spectrometers is ideally suited for stereoanalytical purposes. This {{follows from the}} spatial dependency of the bond making stage of the rearrangement. Examples are noted which demonstrate how such rearrangements may be utilized to assign configuration with and without deuterium labelling even when only one stereoisomer is available. These rearrangements may occur from molecular ions generated by electron impact or field ionization. Chemical ionization and ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry {{are known to be}} sensitive to stereoisomerism but have yet to be developed as stereoanalytical devices. Simple cleavage reactions of molecular ions may reveal stereoisomeric information when two diastereomers give rise to identical product ions. In the latter case appearance potential differences and product intensities differences mirror the enthalpic differences of the precursor neutral diastereomers. These thermochemical effects could be utilized to assign configuration to stereoisomers. In 1865 a sample of honeystone was brought to the laboratory of Adolph von Baeyer in the Technical High School at Charlottenburg. Baeyer, whose interests in structural chemistry were shaped by his mentor, Friedrich Kekule, began a series of investigations which by the 1880 's had brought him to the stereochemical problems associated with the hydrogenated forms of the various carboxyl substituted benzenes derived from the honeystone (ref. 1). In a paper concerned with the geometrical isomers of hexahydroterephthalic acid (ref. 2), a material derived from his honeystone investigations, Baeyer recognized that the relationship of the two carboxylic acid groupings in the two cyclohexane isomers paralleled that in fumaric and <b>maleic</b> <b>acids,</b> named the isomers accordingly as fumaride and maleide, and utilized the exclusive formation of anhydride with loss of water to assign configuration to the maleide hexahydroterephthalic acid (Fig. 1) ...|$|R
