40|$|This study {{examines}} the piano teaching methodologies used to train final-year undergraduate performance students at four tertiary institutions in Hong Kong. As {{there is a}} hierarchical relationship among the philosophies, principles, and <b>methodologies</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching,</b> this study discusses two chief areas of philosophy, five principles, and six aspects <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>methodologies</b> that were identified in the literature as being important in the <b>teaching</b> <b>of</b> piano performance. The philosophies include both philosophical ideas and philosophies that are derived from practical experience. The philosophical ideas investigated include rationalism, empiricism, and pragmatism, and the philosophies derived from practical experience cover the issues of inculcating in students an abiding enjoyment and love of music; acknowledgement of the place of aesthetic education in the <b>teaching</b> <b>of</b> piano; recognition of the teacher’s and performer’s roles in transmitting to others musical knowledge, personal insights, and a significant expression of culture; ideally, the need for pianists to be well-balanced intellectually and emotionally and not narrowly focused; the importance of instilling in students a sense of humanity that goes beyond their role as a mere pianist and, ideally, gives them a world perspective. The five principles identified relating to the <b>teaching</b> <b>of</b> piano performance majors include: the need to nurture in students an ability to express emotions and ideas; the importance of pianists producing a considered and appropriate tonal quality; the importance of developing the imagination and nurturing creativity; recognizing the need for encouragement and stimulation in teaching; and committing to quality teaching. These ideas provide {{the foundation for the}} discussion <b>of</b> the <b>methodologies</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> piano performance, which is divided into the six aspects of technique, style, memorization, practicing, acute listening skills (or extending aural ability), and devising solutions to stage fright. The information in this research was collected from the four tertiary institutions in Hong Kong that offer a Bachelor degree in music. The participants included the heads of department, the teachers of final-year undergraduate piano performance students, and undergraduate students of piano. Case studies of the ten teachers’ are presented that include their philosophies, their principles, and the teaching methodologies that they used to teach technique, style, memorization, practice, and the development of aural ability, and {{to solve the problem of}} stage fright. The data from the heads of department, teachers, and students were analyzed, and the findings from this analysis are presented.

40|$|Proofs by {{induction}} {{are central to}} many computer science areas such as data structures, theory of computation, programming languages, program efficiency-time complexity, and program correctness. Proofs {{by induction}} can also improve students’ understanding and performance of computer science concepts such as programming languages, algorithm design, and recursion, as well as serve as a medium for teaching them. ^ Even though students are exposed to proofs by induction in many courses of their curricula, they still have difficulties understanding and performing them. This impacts the whole course of their studies, since proofs by induction are omnipresent in computer science. Specifically, students do not gain conceptual understanding of induction early in the curriculum and as a result, they have difficulties applying it to more advanced areas later on in their studies. ^ The goal of my dissertation is twofold: (1) identifying sources of computer science students’ difficulties with proofs by induction, and (2) developing {{a new approach to}} teaching proofs by induction by way of an interactive and multimodal electronic book (e-book). For the first goal, I undertook a study to identify possible sources of computer science students’ difficulties with proofs by induction. Its results suggest that there is a close correlation between students’ understanding of inductive definitions and their understanding and performance of proofs by induction. For designing and developing my e-book, I took into consideration the results of my study, as well as the drawbacks <b>of</b> the current <b>methodologies</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> proofs by induction for computer science. I designed my e-book {{to be used as a}} standalone and complete educational environment. I also conducted a study on the effectiveness of my e-book in the classroom. The results of my study suggest that, unlike the current <b>methodologies</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> proofs by induction for computer science, my e-book helped students overcome many of their difficulties and gain conceptual understanding of proofs induction. ...|$|R
