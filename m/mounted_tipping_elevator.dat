2500|$|The pilot's cockpit, with a faired {{headrest}} behind it, was at {{the trailing}} edge of the upper wing, placed within a small cut-out to improve his limited view. The H.26 had a fuselage built around four metal tube, cross-braced longerons, enclosed within metal formers and stringers to shape it into an oval cross-section. Behind him the fuselage tapered to the broad chord fixed tail surfaces. [...] The mid-fuselage tailplane, which had a strongly swept leading edge, carried round <b>tipped</b> <b>elevators</b> that narrowed inboard. [...] The vertical tail was oval shaped, with a broad chord rudder that ended {{at the top of the}} fuselage.|$|R
50|$|The twin {{vertical}} tail {{is located at}} the boom <b>tips.</b> The <b>elevator</b> unit is located between them. The monospar fins are sheathed in laminated wood. The control surfaces on the wooden frame are canvas-sheathed.|$|R
25|$|Its {{fuselage}} was {{a simple}} rectangular cross section wooden structure skinned with plywood. The single seat, open, unscreened cockpit was immediately below the leading edge. The landing skid was mounted {{on the front end}} of a curved, deep, covered frame on the fuselage underside, separating from it aft and rubber sprung well clear towards its end. The fuselage tapered rearwards, where there was a small tail bumper. The tail was {{different from that of the}} BS.16; although the same triangular tailplane and parallel chord, cropped <b>tipped</b> <b>elevators</b> were used, they were mounted on top of a low, straight edged fin. A new, large, balanced, angular rudder, hinged at the extreme tail extended down to the keel, operated in a cut-out between the elevators.|$|R
2500|$|The Type XI {{remained}} in production until {{the outbreak of}} the First World War, and a number of variations were produced. Various types of engine were fitted, including the 120° Y-configuration, [...] "full radial" [...] three-cylinder Anzani (the restored example at Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome still flies with this) and the [...] and , seven cylinder Gnome rotary engines. [...] Both single and two-seat versions were built, and there were variations in wingspan and fuselage length. In later aircraft the <b>tip</b> <b>elevators</b> were replaced by a more conventional trailing edge elevator, the tailwheel was replaced by a skid, and the former [...] "house-roof" [...] five-member dorsal cabane being replaced by a simpler, four-sided pyramidally framed unit similar to the ventral arrangement for the later rotary-powered versions. Blériot marketed the aircraft in four categories: trainers, sport or touring models, military aircraft, and racing or exhibition aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Plans for the Professor {{were widely}} sold to {{commercial}} manufacturers and to clubs both in Germany and abroad, though {{the total number}} of Professors built, sometimes with small variations, is not known. One at least, constructed in Germany, came to the UK and was flown by Philip Wills. Two were built in the United States as Heller Hawks. Like other high performance gliders of it day, it was slow to come out of turns and with its strongly tapered wing, prone to tip stalling. The Professor II, first flown in 1929, addressed some of these problems by increasing the mean overall wing chord with fuller, curved ailerons, modifications first applied to the prototype Rhöngeist. The Professor II also had new horizontal tail with a fixed, swept tailplane mounting constant chord, rounded <b>tip</b> <b>elevators</b> with a cut-out for rudder movement.|$|R

50|$|The BS.17's wings were, {{like those}} of the BS.16, {{rectangular}} in plan apart from clipped aileron <b>tips.</b> <b>Mounted</b> without dihedral, the two separate wings were built around a pair of spars, one close to the leading edge with plywood covering forward from it around the edge forming a torsion-resistant D-box. Behind it the wing was fabric covered. Centrally, the wings were supported over the fuselage on the same cross braced trapezoidal structure used originally on the BS.16 and later on several other Bonomi gliders. The wings were braced with an asymmetric, faired wooden V strut on each side, attached to the lower fuselage and running to the wing spars at about mid-span. Its fuselage was a simple rectangular cross section wooden structure skinned with plywood. The single seat, open, unscreened cockpit was immediately below the leading edge. The landing skid was mounted on the front end of a curved, deep, covered frame on the fuselage underside, separating from it aft and rubber sprung well clear towards its end.

50|$|In {{common with}} the other {{aircraft}} the 1910 Monoplane was a tractor monoplane with an uncovered wire-braced wood fuselage. It was powered by 40 hp (30 kW E.N.V. water-cooled engine. The fabric-covered wooden wings were mounted on the upper longerons of the fuselage, which tapered to a horizontal knife-edge at the tail, carrying a rectangular rudder and a fixed horizontal stabiliser with <b>tip</b> <b>elevators</b> at each end. In order to reduce drag, the wing bracing used flat steel ribbons rather than wires, the struts of the undercarriage were of streamline section, and a polished aluminium spinner was fitted to the wooden propellor. The twin radiators were positioned over the inner end of each wing, being curved to follow the wing section.The aircraft was exhibited at the 1910 Aero Exhibition at Olympia, after which it {{was taken to the}} Royal Aero Club's flying field at Eastchurch for testing, where it first flew on 3 April piloted by Warwick Wright.|$|R

2500|$|The M.1 was {{powered by}} a [...] le Rhône 9C nine {{cylinder}} rotary engine, fitted with a two blade propeller and an unusually large domed spinner which left only a small gap for cooling air {{between it and the}} almost complete cylindrical engine enclosure. [...] Behind the engine the fuselage was flat sided, with a curved upper decking. [...] The open single cockpit was at the wing trailing edge, and there were cut-outs in both planes to improve the pilot's view. [...] The fuselage tapered aft where the horizontal tail was mounted on top of the fuselage; the original tail surfaces were very small and without a fixed fin. [...] Later versions had an enlarged straight edged tailplane and split pair of angle <b>tipped</b> <b>elevators,</b> a wide chord fin and enlarged rudder. [...] The M.1 had a fixed conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels on a single axle mounted on a pair of V-struts from the lower fuselage longerons and wire cross braced. The only armament was a single Lewis gun, mounted well above the upper wing surface.|$|R

5000|$|This pillar also {{mounted the}} Avia's [...] pusher {{configuration}} Poinsard flat twin engine with its cylinder heads exposed for air-cooling. A 1.60 m diameter propeller rotated over the wing behind the rear bracing strut within the inner {{section of the}} wing. The fuselage was built around four spruce longerons, with formers to round the cross section, and was ply covered. The Avia's single, open cockpit was immediately ahead of the central pillar in a forward fuselage with a roughly prolate elliptical section. Aft of the pillar the fuselage was more slender and flatter sided. The horizontal tail was mounted on a small step with a curved leading edge; the straight swept tailplane {{was little more than}} a faired hinge for full, tapered, balanced and elliptically <b>tipped</b> <b>elevators.</b> Its fin was also small, with a tall, deep curved rudder that extended to the keel; [...] the elevator hinge was well forward of that of the rudder, so only a small cut-away in the elevator trailing edges was needed for rudder movement. The fixed parts of the empennage were covered with ply and the control surfaces with fabric. It landed on a conventional skid, with a pair of retractable wheels to aid ground handling.|$|R
5000|$|About {{the only}} {{noticeable}} {{difference between the}} F.I's overall appearance and the later production Fokker Dr.I examples was a subtle convex curve on {{the outlines of the}} tailplane's otherwise [...] "diagonal" [...] leading edge planform, leading into the aerodynamic balancing surface {{at the end of each}} <b>elevator</b> <b>tip.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Fairey FB-1 Gyrodyne was an {{experimental}} British rotorcraft that used single lifting rotor and a tractor propeller <b>mounted</b> on the <b>tip</b> of the starboard stub wing to provide both propulsion and anti-torque reaction.|$|R
50|$|The Borea seated two in side-by side {{configuration}} and so its generally ovoid section, plywood covered fuselage was {{broad and}} almost circular {{in the cockpit}} area. Ahead and overlapping the wing leading edge, the canopy was multi-framed and blended into the fuselage. Aft of the wings the fuselage tapered markedly to the tailplane, which was mounted just above the fuselage on a very short pedestal. The tailplane and elevators together were straight tapered and round <b>tipped,</b> the <b>elevators</b> unbalanced and with a cut-out for rudder movement. A small fin mounted a full, rounded and balanced rudder which reached down to the keel, protected by an underfin/tail bumper.|$|R
50|$|TXD-07 is an {{electrically}} powered fixed wing UAV in twin boom configuration with tricycle landing gear. Propulsion {{is provided by}} a pair of two-blade propeller driven tractor engines respectively <b>mounted</b> at the <b>tip</b> of each boom.|$|R
50|$|Wingtips {{can also}} house {{the power plant}} or thrust of an aircraft. The EWR VJ 101 used <b>tip</b> <b>mounted</b> jets, the V-22 uses tilting wingtip mounted engines, and the Harrier uses wingtip thrust for {{stability}} while hovering.|$|R
50|$|The {{helicopter}} has a two-blade rotor; each blade has a Gluhareff Pressure Jet engine <b>mounted</b> on its <b>tip.</b> Only one was built; {{it is now}} in {{the collection}} of the Pima Air & Space Museum in Tucson, Arizona.|$|R
5000|$|Shear force feedback: In this mode, a {{tuning fork}} is <b>mounted</b> {{alongside}} the <b>tip</b> {{and made to}} oscillate at its resonance frequency. The amplitude {{is closely related to}} the tip-surface distance, and thus used as a feedback mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|Power for the D-4 was {{supplied}} by a [...] Liberty engine buried within the fuselage {{just behind the}} pilot. A large pontoon was mounted below the fuselage, and small outboard floats were <b>mounted</b> near the <b>tips</b> of the swept-back wings.|$|R
40|$|Methods of {{manipulating}} the forebody vortices on a generic fighter model to produce controlled yawing moments at high angles of attack were investigated. Forces and moments were measured on the complete configuration {{and on the}} isolated forebody. Two schemes for vortex control on the forebody were evaluated: individually-controlled tip strakes and individually-controlled blowing ports. The effectiveness of the forebody strakes in controlling forebody side forces was strongly dependent on the size and location of the strakes. A yawing moment can be produced by deploying the forebody strakes asymmetrically, or can be eliminated by deploying the strakes symmetrically. The most effective strake position {{was found to be}} near the primary separation point, between 105 and 120 deg from windward. Blowing {{on the surface of the}} model was also shown to have a strong effect on the yawing moment. Blowing either forward or aft tangential to the surface appears to be more effective than blowing normal to the surface. The most effective method to control the yawing moment on the forebody was to minimize the natural asymmetry with a pair of small symmetrically <b>mounted</b> <b>tip</b> strakes and to perturb the vortex system away from the symmetric condition with asymmetric blowing...|$|R

50|$|Abandoning the canard {{layout of}} the Blériot V, Blériot and his chief {{engineer}} Louis Peyret next built a tandem wing configuration aircraft, possibly influenced by the Langley Aerodrome. In its initial form the aircraft had two pairs of identical wings rigged with pronounced dihedral mounted on the lower longerons {{at each end of}} the wooden box-girder fuselage, with small <b>tip</b> -mounted <b>elevators</b> on the front wings. Triangular fins were mounted above and below the rear fuselage, with a small rudder hinged to their trailing edge. The undercarriage consisted of a pair of wheels on V-struts at the front of the aircraft and a third wheel mounted slightly behind the midpoint of the fuselage. It was powered by a 24 hp (18 kW) Antoinette V-8 engine.|$|R
50|$|The pilot's single, open cockpit was {{immediately}} {{in front of}} the wing-mounting pillar in an oval section forward fuselage {{similar to those of the}} motorless gliders. The position of the propeller disc just behind the wing required the rear fuselage to be rather shallow, so it was formed by four longerons with plywood covering, resulting in a rectangular section. The empennege was conventional, with a triangular tailplane sitting on a low, raised step with a curved leading edge and carrying straight tapered, square <b>tipped,</b> unbalanced <b>elevators.</b> The rear of the step mounted the rudder hinge bearing a tall, straight tapered and flat topped balanced rudder. The rudder extended to a rounded heel at the keel via cut-aways in the inner edges of the elevators.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} composites. Its wing <b>mounts</b> downturned wing <b>tips</b> that incorporate floats for water operations. The standard engine used is the [...] Rotax 914 four-stroke turbocharged powerplant. The highly swept fin mounts the tailplane high, in a nearly T-tailed configuration. The hull incorporates a built-in step.|$|R
50|$|Some early {{aircraft}} had fins <b>mounted</b> on the <b>tips</b> of the tailplane {{which served}} as endplates. More recent aircraft have wingtip mounted winglets to reduce the intensity of wingtip vortices. Wingtip mounted fuel tanks may also provide some benefit, by preventing the spanwise flow of air around the wingtip.|$|R
