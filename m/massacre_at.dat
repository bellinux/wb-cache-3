5|$|In 1944, {{when the}} United States {{landed on the}} Philippines to {{recapture}} it, orders had been sent out by the Japanese high command to kill the POWs {{in order to avoid}} them being rescued by liberating forces. One method of the execution was to round the prisoners up in one location, pour gasoline over them, and then burn them alive. After hearing the accounts of the survivors from the <b>massacre</b> <b>at</b> the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp, the liberating forces feared that the safety of the POWs being held in the country was in jeopardy, and decided to launch a series of rescue operations to save the surviving POWs on the islands.|$|E

5|$|Tan {{brought to}} the club his {{political}} awareness of Chinese matters. In 1928, following a public outrage over a <b>massacre</b> <b>at</b> Jinan (known as the Jinan Incident) in Shandong {{in which more than}} 5,000Chinese soldiers and civilians were slaughtered by the Japanese, the club set up the Shandong Relief Fund. Its purpose was to raise funds for China, to create awareness amongst the Chinese about the Japanese invasion of China, and to encourage the Chinese to boycott Japanese goods and services. The Chinese community contributed a total of S$1.34 million within a year of its inception.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Wisconsin Heights was the {{penultimate}} {{engagement of}} the 1832 Black Hawk War, fought between the United States state militia and allies, and the Sauk and Fox tribes, led by Black Hawk. The battle {{took place in}} what is now Dane County, near present-day Sauk City, Wisconsin. Despite being vastly outnumbered and sustaining heavy casualties, Black Hawk's warriors managed to delay the combined government forces long enough to allow the majority of the Sauk and Fox civilians in the group to escape across the Wisconsin River. This reprieve was temporary; when the militia finally caught up with the fleeing band it resulted in the Bad Axe <b>massacre</b> <b>at</b> the mouth of the Bad Axe River.|$|E

5|$|The general's {{stance on}} human rights issues has also been quite controversial.

Donayre also joined a campaign to raise funds to defend armed forces personnel accused of committing human rights abuses during the internal conflict in Peru.|$|E
