5|$|Dan {{crossed over}} the island and emerged into the South China Sea, having lost its eye feature and {{weakened}} back into a tropical storm. Convection soon redeveloped as the storm moved northwestward through warm waters. The JTWC reports that Dan reattained typhoon status at 0000 UTC on October 12, although it according to the JMA it did so 24 hours earlier. The typhoon continued to intensify, and the JTWC estimates that it reached its peak intensity at 0600 UTC, with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 130km/h (80mph). The JMA indicates that Dan peaked slightly afterward, with 10-minute sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) and a minimum barometric pressure reading of 960 <b>millibars.</b>|$|E

5|$|During October 7, {{with warm}} water helping to fuel its intensification, Madeline quickly {{intensified}} into a Category 2 hurricane, and was upgraded to a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) early on October 8. Based on hurricane hunter reports, Madeline reached its peak sustained winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) and a peak pressure of 940 <b>millibars</b> early on the 8th. This made Madeline a moderate Category 4 hurricane. Later that morning Madeline made landfall to the northwest of Zihuatanejo as a powerful Category 4 hurricane, before it rapidly dissipated over land.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the storm}} quickly downgraded, and by August 19 {{it was once}} again at minimal {{hurricane}} force. At roughly the same time, it turned more to the west, although it maintained a general northwesterly path. The abrupt weakening {{may have been the}} result of a seeding experiment carried out on the storm in an attempt to deteriorate it. By later in the day, Debbie had begun to restrengthen. It resumed Category 3 intensity on August 20, despite a minor oscillation in magnitude during the day. At this point, the cyclone acquired peak winds of 120mph (195km/h); shortly thereafter, its lowest recorded barometric pressure fell to 951 <b>millibars.</b>|$|E
5|$|Inga {{accelerated}} somewhat as {{it passed}} to the southeast of Bermuda. By the morning hours of October 5, {{it was determined that}} the hurricane posed no significant threat to the island. At 1200 UTC, the storm's lowest known barometric pressure of 964 <b>millibars</b> was recorded. Shortly thereafter, it briefly strengthened to Category 3 status; the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h). As it moved towards the open waters of the Atlantic and entered a cooler environment, it deteriorated to Category 1 intensity on October 6. The hurricane slowed again, and as cold air became entrained into its circulation, it began to lose tropical characteristics.|$|E
50|$|The {{units of}} {{atmospheric}} pressure {{commonly used in}} meteorology were formerly the bar, which {{was close to the}} average air pressure on Earth, and the <b>millibar.</b> Since the introduction of SI units, meteorologists generally measure pressures in hectopascals (hPa) unit, equal to 100 pascals or 1 <b>millibar.</b> Exceptions include Canada and Portugal, which use kilopascals (kPa). In many other fields of science, the SI is preferred, which means Pa with a prefix (in multiples of 1000) is preferred.|$|R

5|$|Older storms have {{incomplete}} pressure readings, {{since there}} were no satellite-based estimates; the only observations were taken by ships, land-based observations, or reconnaissance aircraft when available. Ava's minimum known pressure was measured {{when it was a}} Category4 hurricane, for example. John and Gilma have incomplete pressures because the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, in general, did not publish pressure on systems in the central Pacific (140°W to the dateline) at the time. However, {{it should be noted that}} this list is not identical to the list of most intense Pacific hurricanes. The most intense known Category4 storm in the eastern Pacific was 2014's Odile. The lowest pressure of this storm was 918 <b>millibars,</b> lower than that of some Category 5's, such as Guillermo.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} days, the low moved towards {{the west and}} started to regenerate with a circulation center becoming visible early on October 3. Based on this, the EPHC re-upgraded Madeline to a tropical depression. Continuing to intensify, Madeline was soon upgraded to a tropical storm for the second time. During {{the next day or}} two, Madeline remained near stationary before turning towards the northeast on October 5. As the cyclone moved over an area of warm seas surface temperatures, the storm started to intensify. During the next day, Madeline slowly developed an eye before intensifying into a hurricane. In addition, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported winds 75 mph (120 km/h) winds and a pressure of 984 <b>millibars.</b>|$|E
5|$|At 1800 UTC on September 29, the JTWC {{classified}} {{the depression}} as Tropical Storm Angela. The system initially tracking northwestward, Angela turned westward {{along the southern}} periphery of a subtropical ridge to the north. The tropical storm began to rapidly intensify, and the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm at 1800 UTC on September 30, while the JTWC estimated that it had attained typhoon intensity. The JMA then upgraded Angela to a typhoon shortly thereafter, and assessed it as having reached peak intensity on October 2, with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 925 <b>millibars.</b> Continuing westward, the typhoon attained super typhoon status four days later, and the JWTC reported that Angela peaked in strength on October 5. Between October 5 and October 6, Angela crossed the northern coast of Luzon in the Philippines.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Karl {{originated}} {{in a low}} pressure area that formed along a frontal boundary near the southeastern United States. It approached the Canadian Maritimes {{the next day and}} strengthened to below 1000 <b>millibars.</b> On November 24, the broad cyclone was located south of Newfoundland, and early the next day a mass of convection developed near the core. It evolved into a separate vortex, and {{due to the lack of}} inhibiting wind shear, a small cyclone developed. It became a subtropical storm at 0000 UTC before executing a tight counterclockwise loop as it rotated within the larger cyclone. About 18 hours later, the storm strengthened and gained enough tropical characteristics to be designated a hurricane, accompanied by the formation of a pronounced eye feature. At the time, it was situated around 610miles (1,110km) west-southwest of the Azores. Although the development of a tropical cyclone within a non-tropical storm is rare, it is not unprecedented. An unnamed hurricane in November 1991 also formed in this manner.|$|E
5|$|On the {{top right}} corner of the model for a surface weather map is the {{pressure}}, showing the last two integer digits of the pressure in <b>millibars,</b> or hectopascals, along with the first decimal. For instance, if the pressure at a certain location is 999.7hPa, the pressure portion of the station model will read 997. Although the first digit or two of the pressure is left off, other nearby stations give away whether the pressure starts with a 10 or a 9. Most of the time, choosing first digits that would lead to a value nearest to 1000 works out best. The plotting of this value within the station model allows for the analysis of isobars on weather maps. Within maps which plot data on constant pressure surfaces, the pressure is replaced with the height of the pressure surface.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Dan, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Saling, was the third {{of a series of}} {{tropical}} cyclones that impacted the Philippines and Vietnam in October 1989. The storm developed on October 6, and tracked generally westward throughout its course. After crossing Luzon, the typhoon emerged into the South China Sea and reached its peak intensity, with sustained 10-minute winds of 140km/h (85mph), 1-minute winds of 130km/h (80mph), and a minimum barometric pressure of 960 <b>millibars.</b> The storm moved ashore in central Vietnam and dissipated after moving inland. The storm caused extensive damage throughout its course. In the Philippines, Dan left hundreds of thousands homeless and killed 58 people. Power outages were extensive in the Manila region. In Vietnam, the storm's high winds and heavy rains caused extensive damage and loss of life. More than 500,000 structures were damaged or destroyed and at least 43 people were killed across the country.|$|E

40|$|G {{measurements}} {{are made with}} torsion balance in “vacuum” to the aim of eliminating the air convection distur- bances. Nevertheless, {{the accuracy of the}} measured values appears unsatisfying. In 2000 J. Luo and Z. K. Hu first denounced the presence of some unknown systematic error in high vacuum G measurements. In this work a new systematic effect is analyzed which arises in calm air from the non-zero balance of the overall momentum discharged by the air molecules on the test mass. This effect is negligible at vacuum pressures higher than a <b>millibar.</b> However in the interval between the <b>millibar</b> and the nanobar the disturbing force is not negligible and becomes comparable to the gravitational force when the chamber pressure drops to about 10 E- 5 bar. At the epoch of Heyl’s benchmark measurement at 1 – 2 <b>millibar</b> (1927), the technology of high vacuum pumps was developed, but this chance was not utilized without declaring the reason. The recent G measurements use high vacuum techniques up to 10 E- 10 and 10 E- 11 bar, but the effect of the air meatus is not always negligible. We wonder whether the measurements in the interval between the <b>millibar</b> and the nanobar have been made. As a matter of fact, {{we were not able to}} find the related papers in the literature. A physical explanation of the denounced unknown systematic error appears useful also in this respect. ...|$|R
