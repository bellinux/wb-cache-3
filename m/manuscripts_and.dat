5|$|IPA letters have {{handwritten}} forms {{designed for}} use in <b>manuscripts</b> <b>and</b> when taking field notes; they are occasionally seen in publications when the printer did not have fonts that supported IPA, and the IPA was therefore filled in by hand.|$|E

5|$|Nuskhuri, like Asomtavruli, is {{also often}} highly stylized. Writers readily formed {{ligatures}} and abbreviations for nomina sacra, including diacritics called karagma, which resemble titla. Because writing {{materials such as}} vellum were scarce and therefore precious, abbreviating was a practical measure widespread in <b>manuscripts</b> <b>and</b> hagiography by the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|Oecolampadius and Gerbelius, Erasmus' subeditors, {{insisted that}} he {{introduce}} more readings from the minuscule 1 in the third edition. But according to Erasmus the text of this codex was altered from the Latin <b>manuscripts,</b> <b>and</b> had a secondary value.|$|E

5|$|The reading 'Avete vos' is {{from the}} fifteenth century <b>manuscripts</b> <b>and</b> editions. In this case the emperor is simply {{returning}} the salutation. The literal meaning is, however, 'be well', 'be safe', or 'be sound', and the gladiators understood it as dismissing them.|$|E
5|$|Besides his {{governmental}} career, Gale was {{a member}} of the Society of Antiquaries and the Royal Society, where he served as treasurer. Gale was known as a collector of <b>manuscripts</b> <b>and</b> other antiquarian items, writing a few published works on those subjects. He donated his manuscript collection to his alma mater in 1738, and died in 1744. Although contemporaries felt he was one of the foremost scholars of his age, later historians have been less convinced, contrasting his learning unfavourably with his father's.|$|E

5|$|During the 600 {{years of}} the European Middle Ages from 600 to 1200, the {{tradition}} of herbal lore fell to the monasteries. Many of the monks were skilled at producing books and <b>manuscripts</b> <b>and</b> tending both medicinal gardens and the sick, but written works of this period simply emulated those of the classical era.|$|E
