40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} {{prevalence}} of parents' compliance with follow-up measurements after their child tested positive at a screening to assess problems in social development, {{as well as to}} find demographic, screening-related, and child-specific factors associated with parental compliance. DESIGN: Two-stage screening design. SETTING: Utrecht, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: A random population of 31, 724 children were screened at well-baby clinics at age 14 to 15 months (screen 1). Three hundred sixty-four children underwent <b>screen</b> <b>2</b> (255 children who scored positive at screen 1 [population screening] and 109 children younger than 36 months who were identified by surveillance because of suspected problems in their social development). Main Exposure A <b>2</b> -stage <b>screening</b> was applied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Compliance with recommendations of having either a second screening (after screen 1) or clinical evaluation (after <b>screen</b> <b>2).</b> RESULTS: Of 370 children who tested positive at screen 1, parents of 255 children (69 %) complied with <b>screen</b> <b>2.</b> Three groups were distinguished after <b>screen</b> <b>2</b> (n = 173) : early compliance (clinical evaluation within 6 months) (68 %), late compliance (clinical evaluation after 6 months) (14 %), and noncompliance (no clinical evaluation) (18 %). Late compliance and noncompliance were more common in parents of younger children and children who were identified via population screening. Parents of children with either relatively high cognitive skills and/or low scores on <b>screening</b> <b>measures</b> were less inclined to comply. CONCLUSIONS: Study results suggest higher effectiveness of surveillance over population screening. Screening may well be applied as a second step after surveillance to identify children who need further clinical evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Jaret Malloy, Kate Gurney, Kevin Shan, Ping Yan, Steve ChenAmylin Pharmaceuticals LLC, San Diego, CABackground: Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} an increased incidence of pancreatitis in patients with type 2 diabetes compared with obese nondiabetic individuals. Serum lipase and pancreatic amylase concentrations are {{used in conjunction with}} clinical findings to diagnose pancreatitis. Methods: In two large clinical trials of overweight/obese nondiabetic and type 2 diabetic subjects, lipase and pancreatic amylase were <b>measured</b> at <b>screening</b> and <b>2</b> &ndash; 5 weeks later at baseline (prior to treatment with study medication). Results: Lipase and pancreatic amylase concentrations were above the upper limit of normal (ULN) in 13 % and 6 % of type 2 diabetic subjects, respectively, and were approximately three-fold (3 &times;) higher than the proportion of nondiabetic subjects with levels above ULN. Elevations exceeding ULN were seen in many subjects asymptomatic for pancreatitis; however, elevations &gt; 2 &times; ULN and &gt; 3 &times; ULN were uncommon, and elevations &gt; 3 &times; ULN were often associated with a history of dyslipidemia, hyperlipidemia, and gastrointestinal disorders. Additionally, enzyme concentrations varied within this 2 &ndash; 5 -week screening period, including shifts between elevated and normal levels. Conclusion: Results from this post hoc analysis suggest that, although pancreatic enzymes can be a useful marker for pancreatitis within the proper clinical context, diagnosis of pancreatitis may be confounded in populations known to have asymptomatic elevations associated with disease, such as type 2 diabetes. Further effort is needed to clarify the etiology and epidemiology of pancreatic enzyme elevations in type 2 diabetes. Keywords: diabetes, pancreatitis, amylase, lipas...|$|R

40|$|Well R- 14 {{is located}} in Ten Site Canyon and was {{completed}} {{at a depth of}} 1316 ft below ground surface (bgs) in August 2002 within unassigned pumiceous deposits located below the Puye Formation (fanglomerate). The well was constructed with two screens positioned below the regional water table. Individual static depths measured for each isolated screen after the Westbay{trademark} transducer monitoring system was installed in mid-December 2002 were nearly identical at 1177 ft bgs, suggesting only horizontal subsurface flow at this time, location, and depth. Screen 1 straddles the geologic contact between the Puye fanglomerate and unassigned pumiceous deposits. <b>Screen</b> <b>2</b> is located about 50 ft deeper than screen 1 and is only within the unassigned pumiceous deposits. Constant-rate, straddle-packer, injection tests were conducted at <b>screen</b> <b>2,</b> including two short tests and one long test. The short tests were 1 minute each but at different injection rates. These short tests were used to select an appropriate injection rate for the long test. We analyzed both injection and recovery data from the long test using the Theis, Theis recovery, Theis residual-recovery, and specific capacity techniques. The Theis injection, Theis recovery, and specific capacity methods correct for partial screen penetration; however, the Theis residual-recovery method does not. The long test at <b>screen</b> <b>2</b> involved injection at a rate of 10. 1 gallons per minute (gpm) for 68 minutes and recovery for the next 85 minutes. The Theis analysis for <b>screen</b> <b>2</b> gave the best fit to residual recovery data. These results suggest that the 158 -ft thick deposits opposite <b>screen</b> <b>2</b> have a transmissivity (T) equal to or greater than 143 ft{sup 2 }/day, and correspond to a horizontal hydraulic conductivity (K) of at least 0. 9 ft/day. The specific capacity method yielded a T value equal to or greater than 177 ft{sup 2 }/day, and a horizontal K of at least 1. 1 ft/day. Results from the injection and recovery phases of the test at <b>screen</b> <b>2</b> were similar to those from the residual-recovery portion of the test, but were lower by a factor of about two.

How these measures can be implemented across diverse clinical settings using point-of-care data collection on quality is unknown. To evaluate the implementation of MWM measures by exploring documentation of quality measure adherence across six diverse clinical settings inherent to palliative care practice. We deployed a point-of-care quality data collection system, the Quality Data Collection Tool, across five organizations within the Palliative Care Research Cooperative Group. Quality measures were recorded by clinicians or assistants near care delivery. During the study period, 1989 first visits were included for analysis. Our population was mostly white, female, and with moderate performance status. About half of consultations were seen on hospital general floors. We observed {{a wide range of}} adherence. The lowest adherence involved comprehensive assessments during the first visit in hospitalized patients {{in the intensive care unit}} (2. 71 %); the highest adherence across all settings, with an implementation of > 95 %, involved documentation of management of moderate/severe pain.
