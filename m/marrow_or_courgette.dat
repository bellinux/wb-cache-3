50|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) is the transplantation of {{blood stem cells}} derived from the bone marrow (that is, bone <b>marrow</b> transplantation) <b>or</b> blood.

40|$|Both normal mouse {{bone marrow}} and cells from T cell-containing colonies grown in vitro from normal bone marrow contain cells which can {{specifically}} suppress {{the development of}} cytotoxic T lymphocytes capable of recognizing alloantigens on the bone <b>marrow</b> <b>or</b> colony cells. Suppression, as assessed by reduction in cytotoxic activity, is produced by adding bone <b>marrow</b> <b>or</b> colony cells to mixed lymphocyte reactions between lymph node responder cells and irradiated histoincompatible spleen stimulator cells. The cytotoxic activity is reduced if the added bone <b>marrow</b> <b>or</b> colony cells are syngeneic or semisyngeneic to the stimulator cells but not if they are allogeneic. Suppression results from {{a reduction in the}} number of cytotoxic lymphocyte precursor cells activated in the cultures. The suppressor cells in bone marrow are radiation sensitive and Thy- 1 negative; those in colonies grown from bone marrow are radiation resistant and Thy- 1 positive...|$|R
5000|$|Stage IV {{indicates}} diffuse or disseminated {{involvement of}} one or more extralymphatic organs, including any involvement of the liver, bone <b>marrow,</b> <b>or</b> nodular involvement of the lungs.|$|R

5|$|<b>Marrow</b> <b>or</b> {{blood is}} {{examined}} under light microscopy, {{as well as}} flow cytometry, to diagnose the presence of leukemia, to differentiate AML from other types of leukemia (e.g. acute lymphoblastic leukemia - ALL), and to classify the subtype of disease. A sample of <b>marrow</b> <b>or</b> blood is typically also tested for chromosomal abnormalities by routine cytogenetics or fluorescent in situ hybridization. Genetic studies may also be performed to look for specific mutations in genes such as FLT3, nucleophosmin, and KIT, which may influence {{the outcome of the}} disease.|$|R
30|$|While CT is more {{sensitive}} for reactive bone change it is insensitive for oedema-like change of bone <b>marrow</b> <b>or</b> soft tissues and MRI is preferred for this [36, 37].|$|R

50|$|Naive {{lymphocytes}} (those with {{no history}} of contact with antigens) travel from the bone <b>marrow</b> <b>or</b> high endothelial venules of the thymus where they develop as lymphoblasts, to lymph nodes, where they mature.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{bread and}} butter puddings were called whitepot and used either bone <b>marrow</b> <b>or</b> butter. Whitepots could also be made using rice instead of bread, giving rise to the rice pudding in British cuisine.|$|R
50|$|In some {{severely}} affected patients, NEMO deficiency {{syndrome is}} treated using a bone <b>marrow</b> <b>or</b> {{blood stem cell}} transplant. The aim is to replace the faulty immune system with an immune system from a healthy donor.|$|R
50|$|Physicians {{look for}} donor {{material}} {{on behalf of}} a patient by submitting the patient’s HLA tissue type to the NMDP, which then searches its computerized database for matching donor (<b>marrow</b> <b>or</b> PBSC) or cord blood units.|$|R
50|$|TEN {{has also}} been {{reported}} to result from infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, dengue virus. Contrast agents used in imaging studies as well as transplantation of bone <b>marrow</b> <b>or</b> organs have also been linked to TEN development.|$|R
50|$|Aneurysmal bone cysts may be intraosseous, staying {{inside of}} the bone <b>marrow.</b> <b>Or</b> they may be extraosseous, {{developing}} {{on the surface of}} the bone, and extending into the marrow. A radiograph will reveal a soap bubble appearance.|$|R
50|$|In horses {{tendinitis}} {{is called}} a bowed tendon from {{the appearance of the}} affected tendon after it heals without treatment. Mesenchymal stem cells, derived from a horse's bone <b>marrow</b> <b>or</b> fat, are currently being used for tendon repair in horses.|$|R
30|$|The fetus {{immune systems}} are {{collection}} of naïve T and B cells during organogenesis {{and the development}} of lymph nodes, thymus, bone <b>marrow</b> <b>or</b> liver. The developing organ systems of fetus are not subject to external (environmental) challenges that could be harmful to its survival.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method is}} hematopoietic stem-cell transfer, used for {{studying}} lymphocyte development. Hematopoietic cells {{are killed by}} ionizing radiation, and the hematopoietic system is replaced by transfusion of donor bone <b>marrow</b> <b>or</b> purified hematopoietic stem cells. The resulting individuals are termed radiation bone marrow chimeras.|$|R
50|$|Sargramostim {{should not}} be used in {{patients}} with excessive leukemic myeloid blasts in the bone <b>marrow</b> <b>or</b> peripheral blood (≥ 10%), in patients with known hypersensitivity to GM-CSF, yeast-derived products or any component of the product and for concomitant use with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.|$|R
40|$|In {{clinical}} therapy trials using high dosages of systemically administered radioactivity to treat cancer, myeloablation may occur. This is either {{an effect of}} the circulating radioactivity labeled to antibodies ex-posing the bone <b>marrow</b> to radiation, <b>or</b> it may occur because malignant cells in the bone marrow are targeted. Bone marrow cells may be targeted through antigens expressed on cells in the bone <b>marrow</b> <b>or</b> because radioactivity is targeted to the skeleton. Assessment of radiation absorbed dose to the marrow may be useful for dose escalation or individualized patient treatment planning. With successful preser-vation of marrow function with autologous <b>marrow</b> <b>or</b> peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, other normal organs may also receive sufficient radiation to show toxicity. Accurate dose estimates to these or-gans {{is important for the}} design of future studies in order to minimize or avoid toxicity. This paper re-views internally administered high dose radiation therapy studies, and examines the radiation absorbed dose estimates reported from these studies. 11...|$|R
