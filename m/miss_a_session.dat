5000|$|Following her {{resignation}} as Premier, Redford did {{not return}} to her seat in the Legislature despite the ongoing session, and missed at least 11 sittings of the Legislature. According to Section 34 of the Legislative Assembly Act [...] MLAs are permitted to <b>miss</b> <b>a</b> <b>session</b> if they are ill, injured, on official business, or for reasons of bereavement. Redford's extended absence caused speculation in the press and among her constituents, heightened when no official statement was forthcoming from the interim Premier or her staff as to her whereabouts or reasons for not attending. Speculation was heightened further when Redford was spotted in the resort town of Palm Springs, California during her absence. It was then noted that Redford served official notice to the speaker that her absence would continue, though [...] "the reason for her excuse is confidential." [...] In declaring her absence to the speaker, Redford ensured she would not be docked pay for non-attendance in the Legislature, whose rules state that a token deduction of $100 a day would be levied for each day missed, after the first 10 consecutive days absent. Redford returned to the legislature on May 5, 2014. In response to a media scrum, she noted that she spent the time off with family in Palm Springs but also worked in her constituency, as her intention was to complete her term as the MLA for Calgary-Elbow. On August 6, 2014, she resigned her seat in the legislature in order to [...] "start the next chapter of my life." [...] In a public statement published in the Calgary Herald and Edmonton Journal she recognized [...] "that mistakes were made along the way" [...] and accepted responsibility for her decisions. She added that she and her family will continue to live in Alberta and that she plans to teach as well as resume her work in international development and public policy.|$|E
30|$|Each {{intervention}} is given twice weekly {{for a total}} of 16 sessions over a targeted treatment period of 8  weeks. This training frequency mirrors a standard clinical PT treatment block. A maximum of 10  weeks is targeted to keep the dose as close to twice a week as possible while taking into account the occasional need to <b>miss</b> <b>a</b> <b>session</b> due to illness, vacation, and other unavoidable interruptions. The total number of sessions is similar to trials in which Lokomat effectiveness was demonstrated (Koenig et al. 2008; Borggraefe et al. 2010 a, b; Meyer-Heim and van Hedel 2013; Schroeder et al. 2014 a, b) while a chief difference is the total duration of the treatment period, in that other Lokomat trials have used a short intensive burst of therapy (e.g., 15 treatments over three weeks). Our concern from a motor learning and assimilation standpoint is that a short burst may be insufficient time for the child to develop and integrate new skills gained through training into their daily life.|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} people living with disabilities is increasing. Good {{adherence}} to rehabilitative programmes is critical for optimal health and health systems in developing countries are under pressure to meet multiple health needs. Overworked practitioners assume that if the patients fail {{to show up for}} their appointments they have lost interest. The {{purpose of the study was}} to explore reasons for the poor adherence of patients with neurological disorders at rehabilitative services. This study used a phenomenological approach and purposive sampling. One-on-one interviews with patients booked to receive therapy at a South African public sector hospital and who failed to attend therapy were done (n= 12). For triangulation purposes interviews were conducted with patients who had never missed sessions (n= 5). A total of eight of the participants from both groups said that they had not accepted their condition. All five dimensions of adherence described in the literature were found. The participants gave very positive feedback on the rehabilitative programmes received at the hospital, but said circumstances beyond their control had caused them to <b>miss</b> <b>a</b> <b>session.</b> These included fear of losing jobs, unavailability of transport, and perception of poor services at primary health care clinics when down referred. The reasons for adherence or lack of it are not easily established. Contributing factors however were noted in this study. Information obtained from the study will assist health professionals to understand the patients’ context and can inform rehabilitation programmes to support adherence.

40|$|Introduction Good {{adherence}} to rehabilitative services {{is critical for}} optimal health. Practitioners assume that if the patients fail {{to show up for}} their appointments they have lost interest. This study sought to establish the reasons for the poor adherence of patients with different forms of neurological disorders at the rehabilitative services of the outpatients department of Tambo Memorial Hospital (TMH). Methods This study used a mixed methods study design. One-on-one interviews with patients booked to receive therapy at TNM and who failed to attend therapy were done (n= 12). For triangulation purposes interviews were conducted with the patients who have never missed sessions (n= 5). Results A total of eight of the participants from both groups said that they had not accepted their condition. The participants gave very positive feedback on the rehabilitative services received at the hospital, but said circumstances beyond their control had caused them to <b>miss</b> <b>a</b> <b>session.</b> The need to earn income among those working in the informal sector was a negative influence on adherence. Conclusion The reasons for adherence or lack of it are not easily established. Contributing factors however were noted in this study. These include participants not being able to go to their therapy sessions due to a fear of losing their jobs, unavailability of a mode of transport, poor services at primary health care clinics when down referred. Information obtained from the study will assist health professionals at TMH to provide services that are more tailored to the patients and improve adherence.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a paradigm {{and its associated}} collaboration artifact to allow exible support for asynchronous collaboration. Under this paradigm, <b>a</b> user <b>session</b> with <b>an</b> application's user interface is encapsulated into a data artifact, referred to as <b>a</b> <b>session</b> object. Users collaborate by annotating, by modifying, and by a back-and-forth exchange of these session objects. Each session object is composed of several data streams that encapsulate audio annotations and user interactions with the application. The replay of <b>a</b> <b>session</b> object is accomplished by dispatching these data streams to the application for re-execution. Re-execution of these streams is kept synchronized to maintain faithfulness to the original recording.

50|$|A {{procedural}} {{issue of the}} early Senate was what role the vice president, the President of the Senate, should have. The first vice president was allowed to craft legislation and participate in debates, but those rights were taken away relatively quickly. John Adams seldom <b>missed</b> <b>a</b> <b>session,</b> but later vice presidents made Senate attendance a rarity. Interestingly, although the founders intended the Senate to be the slower legislative body, {{in the early years}} of the Republic, it was the House that took its time passing legislation. Alexander Hamilton’s Bank of the United States and Assumption Bill (he was then Treasury Secretary), both of which were controversial, easily passed the Senate, only to meet opposition from the House.|$|R

Other positions included Vice-President of the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts, Trustee for the British Museum and a Commissioner on the Board of Longitude. From 1758 until 1762 he was governor at Rivington Grammar School and was a trustee of Blackrod Grammar School from 1736 {{although he did not}} attend meetings.

During its sessions he made himself distinguished on account of his common sense. He bitterly opposed the ratification by the state of the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions and their defeat is largely due to him. He was also a member of the convention of 1835 for a new constitution for the state. In 1798 Governor Johnston wrote to Supreme Court Justice James Iredell, [...] "There are some men of very good understanding in both houses. Riddick, from Gates, has more influence in the Senate; he seems generally disposed to do what is right, but will go about it in his own way."

5000|$|Besides tending his nursery and gardens, Gillet {{experimented with}} wine making, did book binding and wrote essays and columns about horticulture, astronomy, navigation, and California Indians. He closed his barbershop in 1882 to devote his full energy to his nursery. Possibly {{due to his}} admiration of abolitionists Samuel and Julia Ward Howe, Gillet was among the few whites who, in the Reconstruction Era, {{publicly}} supported equal rights for Nevada County’s few African-Americans — {{some of whom were}} former slaves. [...] Gillet’s racial tolerance, however, did not extend to the Chinese, whose businesses in Nevada City were adjacent to his own. Gillet was one local leader of the Workingmen’s Party of California, a nativist labor organization whose agitation against Chinese immigrant workers on the Central Pacific Railroad led to the federal Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. In April 1881, Nevada City passed an ordinance that “all Chinese shall be removed from the Nevada City within 60 days.” From 1878 to 1881, Gillet was twice elected to the Nevada City Town Trustees. He helped make the city government more effective and progressive and reportedly never <b>missed</b> <b>a</b> <b>session.</b> He was <b>a</b> trustee during construction of a new city hall.|$|R
