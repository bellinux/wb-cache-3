30|$|As {{this study}} {{hypothesized}} that {{different sets of}} variables from each planning zone to be selected with different relative importance reflecting each planning zone’s surface characteristics and socioeconomically different context, the RF method appeared to confirm this expectation. For example, planning zones with relatively higher pavedness such as CBD <b>zone</b> and the <b>mixed-use</b> district <b>zone</b> selected most of the biophysical variables with relatively higher importance than other independent variables used for the variable selection (Figs.  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11). Also, in the urban dwelling district zone, socioeconomic variables explaining educational attainment, ethnicity, household level economic status selected with relatively higher importance (Fig.  6), however in the suburban dwelling district zone, {{the relative importance of}} age-related variables were found higher (Fig.  7). These findings support the argument of this study expressing the need of planning zone specific UHIs mitigation strategies and action plans. The result of PCA, which is summarized in Table  3, also supported the main argument of this study that for different planning zones, different types of variables should be considered with different importance.|$|R
40|$|Melbourne has {{a strikingly}} diverse {{multicultural}} population of around four million people, but {{is founded on}} an Anglo-European heritage that, until the late 1960 s, fiercely attacked multiculturalism as anathema to its cultural-political harmony. It is a densely urbanised and vibrant city of high-rise buildings, restaurants, parks and bluestone footpaths yet its metropolitan footprint radiates outwards into a region of ever-stretching car-dependent suburbs, <b>mixed-use</b> peri-urban <b>zones</b> and a hinterland of temperate dry-land farming {{where most of the}} trees have been cut down. It is a trading city with a global port, although its manufacturing base for export has steadily declined since the 1970 s. It is the administrative and service centre for the south-east corner of Australia, and yet 90 per cent of traded imports stay in the metropolitan area.

40|$|Governments {{are being}} asked to {{integrate}} uses of ocean resources and space by developing comprehensive zoning plans. The current, sectoral practice establishes individual areas, such as marine protected areas, that satisfy constituents' first-possession strategies to claim de facto ownership, but the zones are not integrated. Also, the emphasis on exclusive-use zoning to minimize spillovers in both approaches is costly when the value of excluded production is greater than spillover damages. Alternatively, property rights could be allocated to claimants and exchanged in contracts that internalize spillovers, account for all sources of value, and result in an optimal pattern of <b>mixed-use</b> and exclusive-use <b>zones.</b> Ocean zoning Spillovers Contracting Property rights First-possession rule...|$|R
30|$|The {{uniqueness}} of the mixed-use district’s land use pattern can be summarized by its vertical characteristics as its zoning ordinance does not regulate the maximum height of the building. In accordance with this uniqueness, the maximum building height and the average building height were identified as highly determinant variable {{in the formation of}} UHIs (Fig.  11). Together with building height variables, built area biophysical characteristics variables including percent developed imperviousness, NDVI, total building footprint, percent tree canopy, and the total area of a parcel were identified as important variables. Also, socioeconomic variables including total number of population over age 65, population density of a Census block group, total number of non-white population, total number of population under age 18, median house value, total number of population have education less than 9 th grade, and total number of female population were found relatively important. With these 14 variables, the RF explains 81.04 % of total variance in the dataset and the RMSE was 0.751  °C with the rRMSE was 3.41 % (Fig.  11). Unlike previous planning zones, the PCA result for the <b>mixed-use</b> district <b>zone</b> selected two principal components including demographic characteristics and urban vertical characteristics. None of the socioeconomic variables were identified as one of the principal components. With these two principal components, total 44.7 % of the variance of the dataset was explained (Table  3).|$|R
40|$|As the world’s rural populations {{continue}} to migrate from farmland to sprawling cities, transport networks form an impenetrable maze within which monocultures of urban form erupt from the spaces in‐between. These urban monocultures are as problematic to human activity in cities as cropping monocultures are to ecosystems in regional landscapes. In China, {{the speed of}} urbanisation is exacerbating the production of mono‐functional private and public spaces. Edges are tightly controlled. Barriers and management practices at these boundaries are discouraging the formation of new synergistic relationships, critical in the long‐term stability of ecosystems that host urban habitats. Some urban planners, engineers, urban designers, architects and landscape architects have recognised these shortcomings in contemporary Chinese cities. The ideology of sustainability, while critically debated, is bringing together thinking people in these and other professions {{under the umbrella of}} an ecological ethic. This essay aims to apply landscape ecology theory, a conceptual framework used by many professionals involved in land development processes, to a concept being developed by BAU International called Networks Cities: a city with its various land uses arranged in nets of continuity, adjacency, and superposition. It will consider six lesser‐known concepts in relation to creating enhanced human activity along (un) structured edges between proposed nets and suggest new frontiers that might be challenged in an eco‐city. Ecological theory suggests that sustaining biodiversity in regions and landscapes depends on habitat distribution patterns. Flora and fauna biologists have long studied edge habitats and have been confounded by the paradox that maximising the breadth of edges is detrimental to specialist species but favourable to generalist species. Generalist species of plants and animals tolerate frequent change in the landscape, frequenting two or more habitats for their survival. Specialist species are less tolerant of change, having specific habitat requirements during their life cycle. Protecting species richness then may be at odds with increasing mixed habitats or <b>mixed‐use</b> <b>zones</b> that are dynamic places where diverse activities occur. Forman (1995) in his book Land Mosaics however argues that these two objectives of land use management are entirely compatible. He postulates that an edge may be comprised of many small patches, corridors or convoluting boundaries of large patches. Many ecocentrists now consider humans to be just another species inhabiting the ecological environments of our cities. Hence habitat distribution theory may be useful in planning and designing better human habitats in a rapidly urbanising context like China. In less‐constructed environments, boundaries and edges provide important opportunities for the movement of multi‐habitat species into, along and from adjacent land use areas. For instance, invasive plants may escape into a national park from domestic gardens while wildlife may forage on garden plants in adjoining residential areas. It is at these interfaces that human interactions too flow backward and forward between land types. Spray applications of substances by farmers on cropland may disturb neighbouring homeowners while suburban residents may help themselves to farm produce on neighbouring orchards. Edge environments {{are some of the most}} dynamic and contested spaces in the landscape. Since most of us require access to at least two or three habitats diurnally, weekly, monthly or seasonally, their proximity to each other becomes critical in our attempts to improve the sustainability of our cities...|$|R
