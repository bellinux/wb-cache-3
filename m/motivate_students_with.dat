40|$|Abstract: Edutainment has {{recently}} been a major growing area of education, showing great promise to <b>motivate</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> relevant activities. The authors are among innovators who have developed cutting-edge fusions of popular culture and STEM concepts to engage and to motivate middle school students, using vehicles such as music/song and skateboarding. The importance of using relevant and practical methods of instruction and curriculum delivery that build on student interests and increase enjoyment {{in the learning process}} are critical at the middle school level, especially in the STEM fields. The use of edutainment in this manner is meant to inspire broader interest in mathematics and science for middle school students and to develop a culture of education that makes learning more accessible to all students. This paper surveys and illustrates the use of such immersive modalities to involve middle school students actively with concepts and suggests further directions for the use of demonstrations and videos in educational settings...|$|E

The design of study was causal comparative. The statistical techniques of frequency distribution, mean, standard deviation, median, quartile deviations and t-test were used for analysis. The main conclusion drawn from the study was that there was significant difference between the academic achievement of intrinsically <b>motivated</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> high causal attributions and that of extrinsically <b>motivated</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> low causal attributions thus confirming Weiner’s attribution theory. *Address for correspondence...|$|R

40|$|New {{learning}} tools, {{media and}} technologies, such as computer games, mobile devices, web services and social media, have improved the way learners learn and interact to acquire knowledge and skills. Recent generation of students entering universities known as Generation NeXT are digital natives who expect {{information to be}} available {{at any time and}} from anywhere. It is also well-known that this new generation of learners takes information in smaller portions and has shorter attention span. Educators are left to brace with the challenge of ensuring that they are able to use digital media and technologies when designing learning materials. In addition, educators must also work on capturing the attention of the new generation of learners. As such, educators are applying newer pedagogies to engage and <b>motivate</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> learning activities and interactions.

The methodology was based on the analysis of nursing abstracts in SIICUSP proceedings during the studied period, which were classified according to research types, addressed themes, funding agencies and institutions/departments of origin. We identified that most studies were funded by agencies, that non-experimental research predominated and that sociocultural aspects stood out among the research themes. Public institutions provided the greatest contribution to scientific knowledge production. These characteristics are similar to those found by Pereira et al (1999) between 1993 and 1996. The comparative analysis between the production from 1997 and 2004 and PEREIRA et al’s results (1999) also revealed a progressive {{rise in the number of}} presented studies, as well as the increasing participation of other colleges in SIICUSP (restricted to USP until 1996).

40|$|This {{critical}} ethnographic practitioner {{research study}} explored the ways critical multicultural pedagogies supported students with situated privilege to use critical literacy {{to understand and}} challenge heterosexism in a public school. Situated privilege denotes relative privilege in terms of one social identity or group and not necessarily another, so {{although some of the}} students in this study did not have privilege in terms of race or ability, they were all identified as heterosexual and thus had privilege in terms of sexual orientation. ^ These students were enrolled in a Contemporary Issues class which I taught where they developed critical literacy strategies and initiated an action project, which disrupted the heterosexism in the school. Through this critical literacy project they held a Day of Solidarity where they made visible the support for people of all sexual orientations and formed a Gay Straight Alliance with other students in the school. ^ I reviewed literature centered on heterosexism in public schools, scholarship on critical literacy theory and applications, and theories of multicultural education and critical pedagogies. Drawing on critical multicultural analysis and critical discourse analysis, I analyzed student writing, transcripts of class discussions, interviews with students and school personnel, students 2 ̆ 7 surveys, and other artifacts along with my fieldnotes to explore the students 2 ̆ 7 development of critical literacy and social justice activism. ^ I found that using critical multicultural pedagogies emphasizing critical literacy can help prepare and <b>motivate</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> situated privilege to interrupt their own behavior and reinvent themselves as allies and agents of change. Some of the ways the students developed critical literacy were specific to their situated privilege. These included recognizing their own privilege and role in maintaining oppression, understanding the dynamics of oppression, problematizing their own participation in dominant Discourses, identifying as allies, and developing an awareness and willingness to use their power to take social action. ...|$|E

40|$|Modules in {{professional}} issues sometimes sit a little awkwardly {{in the computer}} science curriculum. They {{can be seen as}} an island of discursive teaching coming from what Biglan might have termed the ‘soft applied’ field of study. In computer science the more usual context is of knowledge and skills based learning and activities of a ‘hard pure/hard applied’ fields of study. This gap may be particularly difficult in those countries where students arrive who have specialized early in subjects related to science, technology and mathematics. The authors of this practice sharing paper have had many years of experience teaching such modules to computer science cohorts, but have recently been faced with the challenge of consolidating two distinct courses previously taught in years one and two of the undergraduate curriculum.

This study enhances our knowledge of how institutions instill the idea of ‘giving back’ in students and why young people decide to support higher education through a case study of the United Negro College Fund 2 ̆ 7 s (UNCF) National Pre-Alumni Council (NPAC). NPAC aims to teach students about the importance of giving. ^ Guided by prosocial behavior, organizational development, and relationship marketing theories this organizational case study explores how NPAC instills the importance of giving to students and what influences participants 2 ̆ 7 philanthropic behaviors. The study includes 25 interviews of NPAC participants and advisors from 13 institutions, representing one-third of the UNCF. ^ This research broadens our understanding of how African Americans in the millennial generation think about and choose to act philanthropically and the role that Black colleges play in the cultivation of these behaviors. NPAC 2 ̆ 7 s programs use both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations that stimulate college students to respond with participation as both donors and fundraisers. They <b>motivate</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> gifts and opportunities that are appropriate for the developmental stage of college students. Further the use of messages and opportunities to participate in racial and community uplift adds to NPAC 2 ̆ 7 s success and the participants 2 ̆ 7 desires to be involved.

Additionally, NPAC 2 ̆ 7 s education of students on the importance of giving and needs of the UNCF and the member colleges is extremely important to involving students in their work.
