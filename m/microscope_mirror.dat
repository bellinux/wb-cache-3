40|$|International audienceA {{scanning}} electron <b>microscope</b> <b>mirror</b> method {{analysis has}} been developed to study the geometry of the trapped charge distribution within irradiated insulators. Several authors have noted that the optical geometrical approximation is an appropriate model to illustrate the mirror image formation. Nevertheless, some results have shown {{that it is not}} possible to use such model in the case of anisotropic material in which we can observe an elliptic mirror image. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical model to explain the formation of such elliptic mirror, which confirms the electric charge delocalization...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{analysis}} {{of a large number}} of normal incidence multilayer x ray microscopes based on the spherical mirror Schwarzschild configuration is examined. Design equations for the spherical mirror Schwarzschild microscopes are summarized and used to evaluate mirror parameters for microscopes with magnifications ranging from 2 to 50 x. Ray tracing and diffraction analyses are carried out for many microscope configurations to determine image resolution as a function of system parameters. The results are summarized in three publication included herein. A preliminary study of advanced reflecting microscope configurations, where aspherics are used in place of the spherical <b>microscope</b> <b>mirror</b> elements, has indicated that the aspherical elements will improve off-axis image resolution and increase the effective field of view...|$|E
40|$|A glancing {{incidence}} X-ray microscope using a confocal hyperboloid ellipsoid mirror {{was designed}} to couple optically a Wolter 1 telescope to a CCD focal plane detector. Both the RMS spot size and the point spread function calculations were {{used to evaluate the}} resolution, defocusing, and vignetting effects of the system for microscope focal lengths of 1, 1. 5, and 2 meters and for magnifications varying from 2 to 10 x. For the specific application with the S- 056 telescope, a 2 meter, 8 x microscope with a fabrication ratio of the <b>microscope</b> <b>mirror</b> length to the inner diameter at hyperboloid ellipsoid intersection of 2. 5 {{was designed to}} be used with a thinned, back illuminated CCD detector array with 320 by 512, 30 micron pixels...|$|E

At once he remembered the prohibition, and, with an almost continuous motion of his hands, moved it back, and sat paralysed with astonishment at his action.|$|R

He played on the terrace of the Tuileries Garden, had his own private zoo, and a room filled with scientific instruments telescopes, <b>microscopes,</b> compasses, <b>mirrors,</b> and models of the planets, where he was instructed by members of the Academy of Sciences. A printing press was installed in the palace for him to learn typography. He was taken hunting in the Bois de Boulogne and the Bois de Vincennes. In 1720 and 1721, when he was just ten, the young King himself danced before for the court and public in ballet performances in the Salle des Machines of the Tuileries Palace.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{progress}} {{in the study of}} dielectric properties and the formation of secondary electrons images and especially in the understanding of their mirror curve shape, since the first models for mirror equation were developed, an exact quantitative prediction of the mirror curve for most materials has remained an unsolved problem. In this paper, recent development in the characterization of charge trapping ability of insulators using the scanning electron <b>microscope</b> <b>mirror</b> method (SEMMM) is reviewed. All this work has resulted in unprecedented insights into the early stage of dielectric study and it is also relevant for a deeper understanding of this anomalous effect (mirror effect) as well as for discussion of the factors affecting it. So the dependency of elliptic mirror and the anisotropic effect in the trapping phenomena of charge is highlighted...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of the microstructure (pores and cracks) on electric properties of plasma-sprayed alumina coatings was investigated using the so-called Scanning Electron <b>Microscope</b> <b>Mirror</b> Effect (SEMME) technique. Coatings were sprayed with different alumina feedstock powders on various atmospheres using a CAPS (‘Controlled Atmosphere Plasma Spraying'). Microstructures with various amount of porosity and cracks orientation distributions were analysed. Both outer surfaces and cross-sections of alumina coatings have been analysed by SEMME technique using two complementary modes (measurement of absorbed current and mirror methods). Originally developed to study the behaviour of injected electrons and related phenomena, such as trapping ability, detrapping process and relaxation phenomena in bulk insulating materials, the SEMME technique was successfully applied, in this study, to porous coatings. It is proved that cracks orientation modifies both motion and trapping of charges and therefore the dielectric properties of plasma-sprayed alumina coatings...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe use {{of ceramic}} {{components}} {{in electrical engineering}} and mechanical applications is rapidly increasing. Most of these applications {{require the use of}} ceramics bonded with metal. In this paper,we have studied the role of residual stresses occurring after joining between an industrial alumina ceramic (Al 2 O 3) and Ni-based super-alloy, on the dielectric behaviour of ceramics. The electric charging phenomenon i. e. trapping-detrapping or diffusion of electric charges is studied by Scanning Electron <b>Microscope</b> <b>Mirror</b> Effect (SEMME) coupled with the Induced Current Method (ICM). Knowing that localized trapped charges in ceramics is a source of damage, the correlation between residual stress intensity, apparent-toughness of ceramics and ability to trap charges near the interface was demonstrated: the SEMME and ICM measurements of the quantities of trapped charges near the interface, highlighted the changes in the ceramic properties related to residual stresses due to both thermo-mechanical effect and diffusion of metallic species in the ceramics, during the bonding process...|$|E

40|$|We have designed, analyzed, fabricated, {{and tested}} Schwarzschild {{multilayer}} X-ray microscopes. These instruments use flow-polished Zerodur mirror substrates {{which have been}} coated with multilayers optimized for maximum reflectivity at normal incidence at 135 A. They are being developed as prototypes for the Water Window Imaging X-Ray <b>Microscope.</b> Ultrasmooth <b>mirror</b> sets of hemlite grade sapphire have been fabricated and they are now being coated with multilayers to reflect soft X-rays at 38 A, within the biologically important 'water window'. In this paper, we discuss the fabrication of the microscope optics and structural components {{as well as the}} mounting of the optics and assembly of the microscopes.

40|$|Natural fibres such as jute, coir, sisal, bamboo and {{pineapple}} {{are known to}} have high specific strength and can be effectively used in composites in various applications. The use of hemp fibres to reinforce the polymer aroused great interest and expectations amongst scientists and materials engineers. In this paper, composites with isotactic polypropylene (iPP) matrix and hemp fibres were studied. These materials were manufactured via the patented FIBROLINE process based on the principle of the dry impregnation of a fibre assembly with a thermoplastic powder (iPP), using an alternating electric field. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show the influence of fibre/matrix interfaces on dielectric properties coupled with mechanical behaviours. Fibres or more probably the fibre/matrix interfaces allow the diffusion of electric charges and delocalise the polarisation energy. In this way, damages are limited during mechanical loading and the mechanical properties of the composites increase. The structure of composite samples was investigated by X-ray and FTIR analysis. The mechanical properties were analysed by quasistatic and dynamic tests. The dielectric investigations were carried out using the SEMME (Scanning Electron <b>Microscope</b> <b>Mirror</b> Effect) method coupled with the measurement of the induced current (ICM) ...|$|E

In preparation for the construction of this facility, we have investigated several instrumentation options in detail, and we conclude that near normal incidence single spherical or toroidal crystals may offer the best general solution for high-energy x-raymicroscopy at NIF and at similar large facilities. Kirkpatrick-Baez <b>microscopes</b> using multi-layer <b>mirrors</b> may also be good secondary options, particularly if apertures are used to increase the band-width limited field of view...|$|R
40|$|An x-ray {{multilayer}} <b>mirror</b> <b>microscope</b> {{was designed}} constructed, and implemented to record images at a wavelength of 33. 8 {Angstrom} of laser-irradiated targets. The morphology of the 33. 8 {Angstrom} emission {{from a variety}} of targets was studied at the Livermore Nova laser 2 -beam facility. Imaged were radiatively heated, low-density plastic and silica foams targets, x-ray laser targets, and gas-filled hohlraums. The absolute x-ray flux was determined. A two-mirror microscope and a CCD x-ray detector have been designed and constructed that will provided images with improved spatial resolution and dynamic range. The two-mirror microscope is designed to fit SIM 4 on the Livermore 10 -beam target chamber or any other comparably sized instrument module...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{efforts have}} been devoted {{recently}} to the design, analysis, fabrication, and testing of spherical Schwarzschild microscopes for soft x ray application in microscopy and projection lithography. The spherical Schwarzschild microscope consists of two concentric spherical mirrors configured such that the third order spherical aberration and coma are zero. Since multilayers are used on the mirror substrates for x ray applications, it is desirable to have only two reflecting surfaces in a microscope. In order to reduce microscope aberrations and increase the field of view, generalized mirror surface profiles have been considered in this investigation. Based on incoherent and sine wave modulation transfer function (MTF) calculations, the object plane resolution of a microscope has been analyzed {{as a function of}} the object height and numerical aperture (NA) of the primary for several spherical Schwarzschild, conic, and aspherical head reflecting two <b>mirror</b> <b>microscope</b> configurations...|$|R
40|$|Electrically {{deformed}} {{single crystal}} mirrors {{will be a}} vital part of a first generation of scanning helium <b>microscope</b> (SHeM). Optimized <b>mirrors</b> will be used to focus thermal energy helium atoms into a surface-sensitive, low-energy probe, with a resolution that depends upon the precise mirror shape. Here, we present surface profilometry measurements of a prototype atom mirror. A temporal phase-stepping Mach-Zender fibre interferometer is used to profile the mirror surface with an accuracy of a few tens of nanometres. Results are compared with the theory of small deflections of an elastic thin plate. Our experiments suggest that relatively simple apparatus can induce the mirror profiles required to demagnify a conventional helium source into a microprobe suitable for a SHeM. Use of elliptical boundary conditions in the clamping mechanism afford biaxial bending in the crystal whilst a simple double-electrode design is demonstrated to be capable of asymmetric control of the mirror deformation...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Reflection is {{considered}} as a critical characteristic in professional competitions. Despite propagation of reflection as an important educational issue and existence of several helpful patterns, instructions conducted by teachers to explaining and expanding of it, are very little. Studies related to this topic were mainly performed {{in the field of}} nursing. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the effects of reflection on medical students. Methods: In 2012, between July and December, one hundred medical students who were training in pediatric department of Tabriz children´ hospital, were included in this interventional (before and after) study. At the beginning a questionnaire was filled by participants as “pretest”. Then, in a workshop, principles of reflection and learning domain were taught to them. A notebook entitled “What I have learned” was prepared by them and daily learning was recorded in three aspects of reflection (<b>mirror,</b> <b>microscope</b> and binocular). After three months the same questionnaires were filled as “posttest”. Results obtained from comparing pretest and posttest and information acquired from students notebook were the basis for statistical analyze.          Results: There was statistically significant difference for each question (P < 0. 05).  Deepening the learning, reducing errors, organizing and integrating of individual knowledge, increasing confidence and responsibility, improved patient care and accuracy of interventions were some benefits of this method. Conclusion: Reflection is very helpful educational strategy and can help the students in their communication and increasing skill and knowledge. It also helps to organize and integrate their learning by guiding them in clinical situations...|$|R
40|$|The two-color STED {{microscope}} {{described below}} is {{a modified version of}} the setup described previously (1) : The STED light is taken from a regenerative amplified mode-locked Ti:Sapphire oscillator (REGA, Coherent, Palo Alto, CA) providing infrared pulses at 780 nm of ~ 200 fs duration at a 250 kHz repetition rate and with pulse energies of up to 3 μJ. Half of this laser light is used as the far-red STED light, while the other half is fed into an optic parametric amplifier (OPA, 1 Coherent) to generate the visible STED light pulses at 603 nm featuring pulse energies of 100 - 250 nJ. We stretched the pulse lengths of both STED beams to ~ 300 ps by applying a pair of gratings and a 4 m single-mode fiber (Thorlabs, Inc. New Jersey, U. S. A.) for the visible and a 2 m hollow-core fiber (Air 6 - 800, Photonic Crystal Fibers, Denmark) for the infrared light. We phase-modified both STED beams to form doughnuts and then overlaid them with the excitation beams delivered by the 470 nm and the 635 nm laser diodes (Picoquant, Berlin, Germany). Each of the pulsed diodes was electronically synchronized with the infrared STED pulse train. PSF-engineering of the STED beams was carried out by spatial light modulators (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan) for each STED beam. Applying a 0 - 2 π helical phase ramp on the wavefronts (2) rendered the doughnut-shaped foci. The four beams were coupled into the <b>microscope</b> by dichroic <b>mirrors</b> (AHF Analysentechnik, Tübingen, Germany); they overfilled the aperture of the 1. 4 oil immersion lens used. Fluorescence emission was collected through the same objective and was detected by single photon counting avalanche photodiodes (SPCM-AQR- 13 -FC, Perkin Elmer Optoelectronics, Canada) with an aperture size corresponding to ~ 0. 8 times the magnified Airy disk of the fluorescence spot...|$|R
