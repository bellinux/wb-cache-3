5|$|Known as the {{stamping}} privilege, companies, {{associations and}} individuals {{were permitted to}} submit their own designed and pre-printed envelopes, cards, letter sheets, etc., to the Irish Post Office for impressing with an official post-paid indicia. Window envelopes were popular for printed matter rate mail. The most prolific user was the Electricity Supply Board which used <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> and appointment cards for over forty years. Stamped-to-order postal stationery users included Blackrock College, Córas Iompair Éireann, Esso, Great Northern Railway, and John Player & Sons, Dublin. No stamped-to-order registered envelopes are known. Apparently An Post have withdrawn the stamping privilege without any public notice, because stamped-to-order postal stationery has seldom been seen since An Post {{took control of the}} Irish Post Office in 1984, with only five users recorded by Jung. Between 1963 and 2000 a few philatelically influenced items are known produced by six users.|$|E

25|$|Remote <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> is a {{practical}} example of telemetry. It saves {{the cost of a}} human meter reader and the resulting mistakes, but it also allows more measurements, and remote provisioning. Many smart meters now include a switch to interrupt or restore service.|$|E

In 2001 CAASD signed two service contracts for the installation of meters, <b>meter</b> <b>reading,</b> billing and collection, one for the Eastern and one for the Western part of its service area in Santo Domingo. The contract for the Western part was awarded to the Colombian company AAA, which increased the share of metering from 1% to 25% and increased collected revenues by 128% in less than two years.|$|E
25|$|Consistent with {{principles}} of good laboratory practice, calibration is performed {{with at least}} two standard buffer solutions that span the range of pH values to be measured. For general purposes, buffers at pH 4.00 and pH 10.00 are suitable. The pH meter has one calibration control to set the <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> equal to the value of the first standard buffer and a second control to adjust the <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> to the value of the second buffer. A third control allows the temperature to be set. Standard buffer sachets, available from a variety of suppliers, usually document the temperature dependence of the buffer control. More precise measurements sometimes require calibration at three different pH values. Some pH meters provide built-in temperature-coefficient correction, with temperature thermocouples in the electrode probes. The calibration process correlates the voltage produced by the probe (approximately 0.06volts per pH unit) with the pH scale. Good laboratory practice dictates that, after each measurement, the probes are rinsed with distilled water or deionized water to remove any traces of the solution being measured, blotted with a scientific wipe to absorb any remaining water, which could dilute the sample and thus alter the reading, and then immersed in a storage solution suitable for the particular probe type.|$|E

25|$|Metering, billing and collection. In 2008 {{the share}} of metered water {{consumption}} in total water consumption was 36%, up from only 20% in 1998. However, {{only about half the}} meters were read in 2008 with a <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> rate of only 17.5%. Billing and collection performance is inadequate as total sector collection in 2003 amounted for merely 73% of the total billing. In 1998 this coefficient stood at only 62%. In individual companies the ratio varied greatly between 26% in Yaracuy and 80% in Mérida.|$|E
25|$|The current {{administration}} has supported a {{restructuring of the}} 1999 IDB project. In December 2006 ENACAL signed a five-year service contract which eliminates all private sector development, including the private contracts for the sector in Léon and Chinandega, and gives ENACAL an exclusive service contract for commercial services (<b>meter</b> <b>reading,</b> billing, customer service), supported by the IDB {{as part of the}} modernization of ENACAL. The contract has been criticized by a consumer advocacy group which argues the agreement will make access to public water more costly to most Nicaraguans.|$|E
25|$|While {{a digital}} display {{can easily be}} {{extended}} in resolution, the extra digits are of no value if not accompanied by care {{in the design and}} calibration of the analog portions of the multimeter. Meaningful (i.e., high-accuracy) measurements require a good understanding of the instrument specifications, good control of the measurement conditions, and traceability of the calibration of the instrument. However, even if its resolution exceeds the accuracy, a meter can be useful for comparing measurements. For example, a <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> 5½ stable digits may indicate that one nominally 100,000 ohm resistor is about 7 ohms greater than another, although the error of each measurement is 0.2% of reading plus 0.05% of full-scale value.|$|E

(If the load supplies power to the grid, the disc rotates backwards unless prevented by a ratchet, thus making net metering possible.) ...|$|R

The $500,000 grant covered the replacement of all water and electric meters in the service area, and the upgrade instituted Mueller Systems' AMI system. According to Frankfort Mayor Frank Moracco, the AMI system reduced the number of man-hours required to collect <b>meter</b> <b>reads</b> without eliminating any jobs.

25|$|Madaba Micro Private Sector Participation. In the Madaba Governorate, a {{different}} model of private sector participation (PSP), called Micro PSP, {{has been carried}} out starting in 2006. The Micro PSP involved outsourcing customer service operations to Engicon, a local operator hired on a three-year performance-based contract. Aims of the project were to improve water and wastewater revenue, to increase the billing rate and to develop the customer management organisation, thereby improving efficiency. To achieve this, Engicon trained staff, surveyed and mapped all subscribers and regulated routes to meter readers (to eliminate reader monopoly). The Micro-PSP with Engicon had a variety of positive effects for the Madaba Water Administration: As a result of the cooperation, the Madaba Water Administration could start issuing its own bills instead of having to rely on WAJ structures. The accuracy of <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> improved and net billed water increased by 75%. Net collections increased from 0.9 million in 2005 to 1.9 million in 2008. The levels of non-revenue water (NRW) initially dropped from an average of 45% to 34%, but in 2009 they were back at 40% due to an increase in water pumping pressure. Advantages of the Micro-PSP model include the fact that WAJ maintained asset ownership and that all revenue collected went to WAJ, so that investment costs could be fully recovered within 13 months of operation. The performance-based contract set strong incentives for the private operator to deliver concrete results.|$|E

50|$|This is {{a survey}} meter with a twist. Similar to the CDV-715, the CDV-720 is a fixed-position {{ionization}} chamber survey meter. Unlike any other survey meter, however, this unit has a movable beta shield {{on the bottom}} of the unit for detecting high levels of beta radiation. When slid to the open position, beta particles are allowed to directly penetrate the ionization chamber. With the beta shield closed, only gamma rays can penetrate both the shield and ionization chamber. This <b>meter</b> <b>reads</b> from 1R/h to 500R/h (X1, X10, and X100 scales).|$|R

2500|$|The first SLR cameras with {{internal}} (“through-the-lens” or “TTL”) meters (e.g., the Pentax Spotmatic) {{required that the}} lens is stopped down to the working aperture when taking a <b>meter</b> <b>reading.</b> [...] With a small aperture, this darkened the viewfinder, making viewing, focusing, and composition difficult.

2500|$|The {{imprecision}} {{is compounded}} by the relative likelihoods of false positives and negatives in populations with diabetes and those without. People with type 1 diabetes usually have a wider range of glucose levels, and glucose peaks above normal, often ranging from 40 to 500mg/dl (2.2 to 28mmol/l), and when a <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> of 50 or 70 (2.8 or 3.9mmol/l) is accompanied by their usual hypoglycemic symptoms, there is little uncertainty about the reading representing a [...] "true positive" [...] and little harm done if it is a [...] "false positive." [...] However, the incidence of hypoglycemia unawareness, hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) and faulty counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia make the need for greater reliability at low levels particularly urgent in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, while this is seldom an issue in the more common form of the disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus.|$|E
