5000|$|In 1950 Small {{returned}} to United Artists {{to make two}} Westerns with actor George Montgomery, Davy Crockett, Indian Scout (1950) and The Iroquois Trail (1950). The films were well received and in 1951 Small helped fund Arthur Krim and Bob Benjamin acquire 50% of UA. He then signed a contract to make thirteen more movies for that company, ten within the first year, starting with Kansas City Confidential. This deal ultimately resulted in over seventy films {{over the next ten}} years. During this time he would occasionally make movies for other studios as well but United Artists were his main distributor. David <b>Picker,</b> <b>head</b> of the production for UA, later wrote that [...] "I counted 76 films that Eddie made for the company simply because he was there to start it all. Now that's loyalty." ...|$|R

40|$|Contact {{angle of}} {{three-phase}} Abstract. In {{order to develop}} safe and sustainable food and pharmaceutical emulsions, bacterial cellulose (BC) nanofibrils were prepared to stabilize <b>maize</b> oil/water <b>Pickering</b> emulsions. The influence of BC content and pH value on the emulsion stability was explored. Droplet diameters decreased with BC contents in emulsions. At pH 12, the emulsions were most stable among all tested pH values. The transformation of emulsion structure from liquid to gel-like at 8 - 15 °C with BC content higher than 1. 55 g/L is predominantly depended on the viscoelastic entangled BC network. These results can have meaningful inspiration of designing edible food and pharmaceutical emulsions. 1...|$|R

Red Skull, Sharptooth and Lemonhead first encounter Guybrush when he sneaks into their village and steals a banana. They lock him up in a hut with loose floorboards and later negotiate with Guybrush for items such as the wimpy idol, the banana <b>picker</b> and the <b>Head</b> of the Navigator. The Cannibals also help Guybrush to finally dispose of the Ghost Pirates by brewing up ghost-killing root beer. By {{the time of the}} third game they have gone vegetarian.|$|R
500|$|After a {{hiatus of}} one film—On Her Majesty's Secret Service, in which George Lazenby played Bond—Connery {{returned}} to the role for Diamonds Are Forever after David <b>Picker,</b> the <b>head</b> of United Artists, {{made it clear that}} Connery was to be enticed back to the role and that money was no object. When approached about resuming the role of Bond, Connery demanded—and received—a fee of £1.25 million (£ million in [...] pounds), 12.5% of the gross profits and, as a further enticement, United Artists offered to back two films of his choice. His performance received mixed reviews, with Raymond Benson considering that Connery [...] "looks weary and bored... he is overweight, slow-moving, and doesn't seem to be trying to create a credible character". Despite that, Benson considers that Connery [...] "still radiates more screen presence than Roger Moore or George Lazenby". On the other hand, Pauline Kael said [...] "Connery's James Bond is less lecherous than before and less foppish—and he's better this way".|$|R

[...] The core gameplay {{difference is that}} the <b>picker</b> taps the <b>heads</b> of the other players while duck calling (ex: blue duck, red duck, purple duck, etc.) and then calls [...] "gray duck" [...] in place of [...] "goose". This is actually a more original form of the game as the game originated in Sweden. A similar game was called [...] "Anka Anka Grå Anka." [...] (duck duck grey duck). In some regions and variations, the caller may change the direction in which they run.|$|R

After arguments by <b>Pickering</b> and Winter, <b>heading</b> a blue-ribbon legal team, on May 17, 2006, Helfrich threw out Kennard's original burglary conviction, stating, [...] "To me, {{this is not}} a black and white issue; it's a right and wrong issue. To correct that wrong, I am compelled to do the right thing." [...] Barbour said that Helfrich's decision was the [...] "appropriate, constitutional way for this innocent man to be exonerated." ...|$|R
40|$|Background Maize (Zea mays) is a C 4 {{tropical}} {{cereal and}} its adaptation to temperate climates can be problematic due to low soil temperatures at {{early stages of}} establishment. Methods In the current study we have firstly investigated the physiological response of twelve maize varieties, from a chilling condition adapted gene pool, to sub-optimal growth temperature during seedling emergence. To identify transcriptomic markers of cold tolerance in already adapted maize genotypes, temperature conditions were set below the optimal growth range in both control and low temperature groups. The conditions were as follows; control (18  °C for 16 h and 12  °C for 8 h) and low temperature (12  °C for 16 h and 6  °C for 8 h). Four genotypes were identified from the condition adapted gene pool with significant contrasting chilling tolerance. Results Picker and PR 39 B 29 were the more cold-tolerant lines and Fergus and Codisco were the less cold-tolerant lines. These four varieties were subjected to microarray analysis to identify differentially expressed genes under chilling conditions. Exposure to low temperature during establishment in the <b>maize</b> varieties <b>Picker,</b> PR 39 B 29, Fergus and Codisco, was reflected at the transcriptomic level in the varieties Picker and PR 39 B 29. No significant changes in expression were observed in Fergus and Codisco following chilling stress. A total number of 64 genes were differentially expressed in the two chilling tolerant varieties. These two varieties exhibited contrasting transcriptomic profiles, in which only four genes overlapped. Discussion We observed that maize varieties possessing an enhanced root growth ratio under low temperature were more tolerant, which could be an early and inexpensive measure for germplasm screening under controlled conditions. We have identified novel cold inducible genes in an already adapted maize breeding gene pool. This illustrates that further varietal selection for enhanced chilling tolerance is possible in an already preselected gene pool...|$|R
40|$|Aggressive {{behavior}} and mood disorders frequently appear in childhood. There is often lack of objective {{data to support}} a specific clinical diagnosis. Ultimately {{it is likely that}} alterations in production, concentration, storage, release, reuptake and degradation of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine and gamma-aminobutyric acid play key roles in the manifestations of mood disorders. We sought to determine if more gross anatomic patterns of regional brain activation in a "baseline" state might also supply an objective means of verifying the presence of a mood disorder characterized by anger or aggressive behavior. We studied 8 patients, 3 girls and 5 boys, ages ranging from 6 to 12, referred for SPECT brain imaging with the diagnosis of an attention deficit disorder or autism. All had been reported as having temper problems on the routine questionnaire completed by the parents prior to SPECT imaging. The patients, who were not sedated, had absolute cerebral blood flow measured by the xenon 133 gas inhalation technique followed by intravenous injection of Tc- 99 m HMPAO with an administered dose calculated according to patient age and weight. One hour following the injection, high resolution brain SPECT imaging was performed using a <b>Picker</b> triple <b>headed</b> camera with fan beam collimators. We analyzed the brain SPECT studies using 3 D volume rendered semi-transparent images with dual cut off windows of 88 % (high) and 60 - 65 % (lower value depending on the patient absolute mean cortical blood flow), as well as the traditional transverse, coronal and sagittal sections. The dual window 3 D display helped demonstrate increased perfusion or activation of either or both right and left temporal lobes in all 8 of the patients. This pattern was not seen in children with similar clinical diagnoses but whose parents did not report temper problems. These preliminary findings support the proposition that an increase in perfusion to the temporal lobes may be associated with oppositional or aggressive behavior. They suggest that Brain SPECT with images displayed to emphasize the presence of regions of increased blood flow may be useful in objectively confirming the presence of mood disorders and perhaps in guiding appropriate therapy...|$|R
