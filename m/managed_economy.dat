30|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a growing {{interest}} in the role of entrepreneurship for economies and societies. Audretsch and Thurik (2001) have explained this interest as the result of moving from <b>managed</b> <b>economies</b> to entrepreneurial economies. Big and static businesses and bureaucratic hegemony, which are dominant in <b>managed</b> <b>economies,</b> have been replaced with innovation, knowledge and dynamic structures of companies over the years. This replacement points to a transition to entrepreneurial economies (Acs and Stough 2008). Many researchers have brought out the most important advantage of moving from <b>managed</b> <b>economies</b> to entrepreneurial economies as contribution to economic growth (e.g., Acs and Szerb 2007; Wennekers et al. 2005). This interaction of entrepreneurship and economic growth can be seen in various ways such as employment creation, expanding opportunity pool, knowledge spillovers and fostering innovation (e.g., Agarwal et al. 2007; Block et al. 2013; Holcombe 2003; Rupasingha and Goetz 2013). Stephens and Partridge (2011) have revealed statistically significant relationship between entrepreneurship and growth in lagging regions. Furthermore, many empirical researches have indicated the positive effects of entrepreneurial activities on Gross Domestic Product rates (Aparicio et al. 2016; Audretsch and Keilbach 2008; Zacharakis et al. 2000). Michelacci (2003) has debated the relationship between research and development activities and economic growth. He has revealed the necessity and importance of existence of entrepreneurial activities. According to Michelacci (2003), increases only in resources allocated to research activities are not sufficient for economic growth. Growth occurs when entrepreneurs transform researches into economic activities and facilitate knowledge spillovers.|$|R

Ikeda lowered interest rates and taxes to private players to motivate spending. In addition, due to the financial flexibility afforded by the FILP, Ikeda's government rapidly expanded government investment in Japan's infrastructure: building highways, high-speed railways, subways, airports, port facilities, and dams. Ikeda's government also expanded government investment in the communications sector of the Japanese economy previously neglected. Each of these acts continued the Japanese trend towards <b>managed</b> <b>economy</b> that epitomizes the mixed economic model.|$|E
50|$|Brooks {{believes}} America {{is locked}} in a culture war in which either America {{will continue to be}} an exceptional nation organized around the principles of free enterprise, limited government, a reliance on entrepreneurship and rewards determined by market forces, or America will move toward European-style statism grounded in expanding bureaucracies, a <b>managed</b> <b>economy,</b> and large-scale income redistribution. Brooks states that while some have tried to dismiss the Tea Party demonstrations and the town hall protests as the work of extremists, ignorant backwoodsmen, or agents of the health-care industry, the movement reveals much about the culture war that is underway, and {{it is not at all}} clear the side that will prevail. Brooks fears that rejecting the founding principles for redistributionist statism will permanently lessen the wealth of the US. However, the greatest danger is the abandonment of the pursuit of happiness because only free enterprise brings happiness as a result of earned success.|$|E
5000|$|The third stage, {{which the}} {{government}} called the [...] "completion {{of the construction of}} the material and technical basis of socialism," [...] saw further industrialization and agricultural growth, aided largely by Mongolia's joining the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon) in 1962. After the Sino-Soviet split, Chinese aid ceased, but continued Soviet and East European financial and technical assistance in the forms of credits, advisers, and joint ventures enabled Mongolia to modernize and to diversify industry, particularly in mining. New industrial centers were built in Baganuur, Choibalsan, Darkhan, and Erdenet, and industrial output rose significantly. Although animal husbandry was stagnant, crop production increased dramatically with the development of virgin lands by state farms. Foreign trade with Comecon nations grew substantially. Transportation and communications systems were improved, linking population and industrial centers and extending to more remote rural areas. In the late 1980s, Mongolia had developed into an agricultural-industrial economy, but the inefficiencies of a centrally planned and <b>managed</b> <b>economy</b> and the example of perestroika in the Soviet Union led Mongolian leaders to undertake a reform program to develop the economy further.|$|E

5000|$|Concerns {{over the}} true motivations of public {{officials}} were further encouraged by Public choice theory. A rudimentary {{form of this}} theory was promoted from the early 1960s by James Buchanan, {{at the expense of}} Keynes's standing both in public opinion and among academics. [...] Journalists, Elliot and Atkinson, write that by the late sixties the younger generation had grown up with no experience of life before the <b>managed</b> <b>economy,</b> and therefore had no reason to be grateful to it. Instead they were skeptical about the Establishment's pretensions of altruism, in some cases hostile to what was perceived as its materialism and in other cases passionate for much more progressive causes. A notable worldwide eruption of these feelings caused the Protests of 1968. In the US, disenchantment at the Vietnam War and what was seen as the failure of Keynesian responses against inflation further contributed to the public's loss of faith in government.Buchanan and James Wanger's 1977 book Democracy in Deficit: the Political Legacy of Lord Keynes was one of the more effective attacks against remaining pro-Keynes opinion.A follow up book, The Consequences of Mr Keynes, (1978) by Buchanan and John Burton, further attacked Keynes for his alleged naivete in believing that politicians and bureaucrats are largely motivated by benevolence.This is not to say the public as a whole became positive about the free market. During the seventies those advocating its principles would still sometimes be pelted with eggs and flour bombs by hostile student audiences. However public opinion in the English-speaking world was slowly won over. By the eighties free market institutions were once again widely respected if not widely admired, despite the occasional popular work that tried to bring their dark side to the public's attention, such as Oliver Stone's film Wall Street and Tom Wolfe's novel The Bonfire of the Vanities.|$|E
