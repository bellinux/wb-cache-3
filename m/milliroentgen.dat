2500|$|Numerous {{radiation}} {{surveys and}} cleanup {{of the surface}} of the burial ground and surrounding area have been performed in the years since the SL-1 incident. Aerial surveys were performed by EG Las Vegas in 1974, 1982, 1990, and 1993. The Radiological and Environmental Sciences Laboratory conducted gamma radiation surveys every 3 to 4 years between 1973 and 1987 and every year between 1987 and 1994. Particle-picking at the site was performed in 1985 and 1993. Results from the surveys indicated that cesium-137 and its progeny (decay products) are the primary surface-soil contaminants. During a survey of surface soil in June 1994, [...] "hot spots," [...] areas of higher radioactivity, were found within the burial ground with activities ranging from 0.1 to 50 <b>milliroentgen</b> (mR)/hour. On November 17, 1994, the highest radiation reading measured at 2.5 feet (0.75 m) above the surface at the SL-1 burial ground was 0.5 mR/hour; local background radiation was 0.2 mR/hour. A 1995 assessment by the EPA recommended that a cap be placed over the burial mounds. The primary remedy for SL-1 was to be containment by capping with an engineered barrier constructed primarily of native materials. This remedial action was completed in 2000 and first reviewed by the EPA in 2003.|$|E

2500|$|CRTs can emit a {{small amount}} of X-ray {{radiation}} {{as a result of the}} electron beam's bombardment of the shadow mask/aperture grille and phosphors. The amount of radiation escaping the front of the monitor is widely considered not to be harmful.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the adequacy of silver metaphosphate glass as a dosimeter for gamma radiation coexistent with fast neutrons. The fast-neutron response in the energy region encompassing a major pcrtion of the fission spectrum was determined and a method of decreasing the photon-energy dependence was developed. The size of the dosimeter and reprcducibility of results make this system a useful addition to gamma -ray dosimetry. particularly for gamma rays coexistent with neutrons. In some experiments the greatly increased sensitivity to low-energy photons permits accurate measurement of exposure doses as small as a few hundred <b>milliroentgens.</b> (auth...|$|R
5000|$|Any {{vacuum tube}} {{operating}} at several thousand volts or more can produce X-rays as an unwanted byproduct, raising safety issues. [...] The higher the voltage, the more penetrating the resulting radiation {{and the more}} the hazard. CRT displays, once common in color televisions and computer displays, operate at 3-40 kilovolts, making them the main concern among household appliances. Historically, concern has focused less on the cathode ray tube, since its thick glass envelope is impregnated with several pounds of lead for shielding, than on high voltage (HV) rectifier and voltage regulator tubes inside. In the late 1960s {{it was found that}} a failure in the HV supply circuit of some General Electric TVs could leave excessive voltages on the regulator tube, causing it to emit X-rays. The models were recalled and the ensuing scandal caused the US agency responsible for regulating this hazard, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to require that all TVs include circuits to prevent excessive voltages in the event of failure. The hazard associated with excessive voltages was eliminated with the advent of all solid state TVs, which have no tubes beside the CRT. Since 1969 the FDA has limited TV X-ray emission to 0.5 mR (<b>milliroentgen)</b> per hour. The flat screens used today do not have any vacuum tubes capable of emitting X-rays.|$|E

On 1 November 1951, unable to get official clearance to attend the Operation Buster-Jangle Dog nuclear test, Hill was on Mount Charleston, a large mountain northwest of Las Vegas, in order to view the explosion which occurred about 60 miles to the north. After the explosion, Hill and the other assembled newsmen realized the highly radioactive mushroom cloud was moving in their direction at high speed. Hill {{decided to leave the}} mountain and began driving down the twisting mountain road, but was unable to clear the area before the cloud arrived, and that the cloud was directly over him, [...] "emphasizing its presence with a blast of static on my car radio."

40|$|The present {{investigation}} was undertaken as a preliminary experiment on MgSO 4 : Mn thermoluminescence dosimeter. The sample {{for this study}} was prepared by the method most commonly used, that is, heatinga mixture of MgSO 4 : 2 H 2 O and MnSO 4 : H 2 O to 1 OOO゜C. In the glow curve of our MgSO 4 : Mn, the luminescence glow reached the maximum at about 85 ゜C, 120 ゜C and. 250 ゜C. The response of these glow peaks was linear up to 2400 <b>milliroentgens</b> at least. The rate of the decay of the peaks at 85 ゜C and 120 ゜C were about 6 percent and 5 percent per hour, respectively at　 7 ゜C. The decay of the 250 ゜C peak was very small; less than 25 percent was lost during the first 24 hours. The peaks at 85 ゜C and 250 ゜C showed the maximum sensitivty to the radiation when the sample was prepared 2. 5 mole percent mixture of MnSO 4 : H 2 O and that of 120 ゜C did the same at I mole percent mixture. Thus, it was found that this dosimeter detected a dose as low as 5 milliroentogens. Furthermore, it was observed that the peak at 250 ゜C showed very high sensitivity for triboluminescence...|$|R
