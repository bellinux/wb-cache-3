25|$|However, the JRASC {{article has}} been criticized as lacking any error analysis. Since the {{triangulation}} base used by the astronomers in their calculations was very narrow, even very small errors in determination of directions {{could result in a}} very different triangulated trajectory. Measurement errors of slightly <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one-half</b> degree would make possible a straight-line trajectory towards the Kecksburg area and a much shallower angle of descent than reported in the JRASC article. It was also pointed out that the photos used actually show the fireball trail becoming progressively thinner, suggesting motion away from the cameras, or in the direction of Pennsylvania. Had the trajectory been sideways to the cameras, as contended in the JRASC article, the trail would likely have remained roughly constant in thickness.|$|E

The standard memory cycle allows a length of anywhere from 1 byte to 4 kilobytes in order to allow its larger overhead to be amortised over a large transaction. eSPI slaves are allowed to initiate bus master versions of all of the memory cycles. Bus master I/O cycles, which were introduced by the LPC bus specification, and ISA-style DMA including the 32-bit variant introduced by the LPC bus specification, are not present in eSPI.

Similar results were obtained when cell wall synthesis was inhibited by ristocetin, cycloserine, cloxacillin, or cephaloridine. When sucrose was added to the medium, initiation of deoxyribonucleic acid replication occurred in the presence of vancomycin, to an extent which allowed replication of no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> approximately <b>one-half</b> of the deoxyribonucleic acid of the culture.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between {{high molecular weight}} (large) and low molecular weight (small) forms of phytochrome has been shown earlier {{to be one of}} proteolysis. The products of such proteolysis are characterized here by chromatography through Bio-Gel P- 200 using specific antiphytochrome sera as an assay system. Degradation of large oat (Avena sativa L. cv. Garry) phytochrome as phytochrome, red-absorbing form, phytochrome, far red-absorbing form, or under cycling conditions in crude preparations containing one or more proteases, always yields one fragment with the immunochemical, electrophoretic, spectroscopic, and size characteristics of small phytochrome. In addition, other fragments are detected which may account, in part, for the different molecular weight estimates reported by others for purified, photoreversible phytochrome. The small phytochrome produced by proteolysis with trypsin of a purified large phytochrome preparation is similar to that produced by the endogenously derived protease(s). A large (estimated molecular weight = 90, 000), apparently nonphotoreversible peptide is also identified which is electrophoretically and immunochemically distinct from small phytochrome. Thus, it seems that small phytochrome may not represent <b>more</b> <b>than</b> approximately <b>one-half</b> of the native molecule...|$|R
