5000|$|This {{town was}} known on some maps as Village, and also Village Station, {{with the name}} coming from nearby Village Creek. In late 1881, the Sabine and East Texas Railroad reached the area for the lumber trade to ship its products. The Long Manufacturing Company out of Beaumont {{purchased}} 40,000 acres (160 km²) of timberland and built a sawmill at the site. A short while later, the Texas Tram and Lumber Company of Beaumont purchased this mill in 1883, the majority stockholder being William A. Fletcher. The post office was established this same year. By 1889, this sawmill was churning out 75,000 feet (23 km) of lumber daily. At this time, this mill consisted of two sections of town, {{one of which was}} the mill operations (called Long Station), the other being Village Mills one mile (2 km) away which contained the housing. As an interesting note, one day in 1895 this <b>mill</b> <b>broke</b> a world record by sawing over 250,000 feet (76 km) in eleven hours time. In 1902, the lumber baron and businessman John Henry Kirby purchased the mill which was dubbed [...] "Mill L", an asset of the Kirby Lumber Company. As of 1907, the annual production of lumber was almost 17 million feet (5,200 km).The mill closed in the early 1930s which caused Village Mills' population to drop from 300 down to 80 within the next decade. In 1945, the discovery of natural gas and oil deposits boosted the local economy. Over the next quarter-century, over 31 wells would be drilled, with 17 of these still operating into the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|In the Navajo {{creation}} story, it {{was stated}} {{that the people of}} the tribe had to decide between two yellow substances, uranium or corn pollen. The Navajo people chose corn pollen. They would use it for traditional purposes to heal the people. It was also used to protect them. Finally, they were instructed never to touch uranium. Uranium was described as a serpent, and if it ever was touched it would bring evil, death, and destruction. On July 16, 1979 in a small community on the Navajo Nation in Church Rock, New Mexico, an earthen dam built to hold waste from an underground uranium mine and <b>mill</b> <b>broke</b> and released 94 million gallons of radioactive waste. The spill contaminated the environment, which included soil, water, and livestock and also impacted human health. The contamination leaked into the main water source used for farming and livestock, the local residents were not only affected but as well as people living 80 miles downstream. The demand for uranium decreased in the 1980 ’s until now, the price of uranium increased and proposals to reopen Church Rock and other sites on the Navajo Nation are being considered again by major corporations. The purpose of this research is to inform the public and local residents living in the area about the effects of uranium mining and how it destroyed not only the environment but also the livelihood and health of the people. This is a big concern because the possibility of another mishap or spill is likely to occur once again if more mines and mills reopen. If one of the largest radioactive spills that occurred in U.

40|$|Laser cutting {{implementation}} possibilities into paper {{making machine}} was studied {{as the main}} objective of the work. Laser cutting technology application was considered as a replacement tool for conventional cutting methods used in paper making machines for longitudinal cutting such as edge trimming at different paper making process and tambour roll slitting. Laser cutting of paper was tested in 70 ’s for the first time. Since then, laser cutting and processing has been applied for paper materials with different level of success in industry. Laser cutting can be employed for longitudinal cutting of paper web in machine direction. The most common conventional cutting methods include water jet cutting and rotating slitting blades applied in paper making machines. Cutting with CO 2 laser fulfils basic requirements for cutting quality, applicability to material and cutting speeds in all locations where longitudinal cutting is needed. Literature review provided description of advantages, disadvantages and challenges of laser technology when it was applied for cutting of paper material with particular attention to cutting of moving paper web. Based on studied laser cutting capabilities and problem definition of conventional cutting technologies, preliminary selection {{of the most promising}} application area was carried out. Laser cutting (trimming) of paper web edges in wet end was estimated to be the most promising area where it can be implemented. This assumption was {{made on the basis of}} rate of web breaks occurrence. It was found that up to 64 % of total number of web breaks occurred in wet end, particularly in location of so called open draws where paper web was transferred unsupported by wire or felt. Distribution of web breaks in machine cross direction revealed that defects of paper web edge was the main reason of tearing initiation and consequent web break. The assumption was made that laser cutting was capable of improvement of laser cut edge tensile strength due to high cutting quality and sealing effect of the edge after laser cutting. Studies of laser ablation of cellulose supported this claim. Linear energy needed for cutting was calculated with regard to paper web properties in intended laser cutting location. Calculated linear cutting energy was verified with series of laser cutting. Practically obtained laser energy needed for cutting deviated from calculated values. This could be explained by difference in heat transfer via radiation in laser cutting and different absorption characteristics of dry and moist paper material. Laser cut samples (both dry and moist (dry matter content about 25 - 40 %)) were tested for strength properties. It was shown that tensile strength and strain break of laser cut samples are similar to corresponding values of non-laser cut samples. Chosen method, however, did not address tensile strength of laser cut edge in particular. Thus, the assumption of improving strength properties with laser cutting was not fully proved. Laser cutting effect on possible pollution of <b>mill</b> <b>broke</b> (recycling of trimmed edge) was carried out. Laser cut samples (both dry and moist) were tested on the content of dirt particles. The tests revealed that accumulation of dust particles on the surface of moist samples can take place. This has to be taken into account to prevent contamination of pulp suspension when trim waste is recycled. Material loss due to evaporation during laser cutting and amount of solid residues after cutting were evaluated. Edge trimming with laser would result in 0. 25 kg/h of solid residues and 2. 5 kg/h of lost material due to evaporation. Schemes of laser cutting implementation and needed laser equipment were discussed. Generally, laser cutting system would require two laser sources (one laser source for each cutting zone), set of beam transfer and focusing optics and cutting heads. In order to increase reliability of system, it was suggested that each laser source would have double capacity. That would allow to perform cutting employing one laser source working at full capacity for both cutting zones. Laser technology is in required level at the moment and do not require additional development. Moreover, capacity of speed increase is high due to availability high power laser sources what can support the tendency of speed increase of paper making machines. Laser cutting system would require special roll to maintain cutting. The scheme of such roll was proposed as well as roll integration into paper making machine. Laser cutting can be done in location of central roll in press section, before so-called open draw where many web breaks occur, where it has potential to improve runability of a paper making machine. Economic performance of laser cutting was done as comparison of laser cutting system and water jet cutting working in the same conditions. It was revealed that laser cutting would still be about two times more expensive compared to water jet cutting. This is mainly due to high investment cost of laser equipment and poor energy efficiency of CO 2 lasers. Another factor is that laser cutting causes material loss due to evaporation whereas water jet cutting almost does not cause material loss. Despite difficulties of laser cutting implementation in paper making machine, its implementation can be beneficial. The crucial role in that is possibility to improve cut edge strength properties and consequently reduce number of web breaks. Capacity of laser cutting to maintain cutting speeds which exceed current speeds of paper making machines what is another argument to consider laser cutting technology in design of new high speed paper making machines...|$|E

50|$|New Mill {{was built}} at Mount Ephraim, Framfield {{in the early}} 19th century. In 1855, it was moved to a site some ¼ mile (400 m) south west of its current position. The move was done by Samuel Medhurst, the Lewes millwright. In 1868, it was moved again to its current position, joining another {{windmill}} which {{became known as the}} Old Mill. Medhurst was also responsible for this move. The mill was working until 1969, when a stock <b>broke.</b> <b>Milling</b> continued by auxiliary power in an adjoining building until 1971. The mill is currently under restoration.In August 2014, concerns were raised about the condition of the mill, which is owned by brothers Brian and Geoff Newnham. Following inspection by a millwright in 2015, a crowdfunding appeal was launched to raise £3,000 for emergency repairs to the trestle. When the appeal closed on 8 June, £1,654 had been raised. The Mills Archive Trust also opened an appeal, allowing people to donate by cheque, with the added benefit of being able to increase their donations by 25% via Gift Aid. A total in excess of £7,000 was raised by the two appeals. Initial work to strengthen the trestle was scheduled to be completed in October 2015.|$|R

6000|$|When he {{was eight}} years old, he began to work in his father's tannery, where he drove the horse that turned the bark <b>mill,</b> and <b>broke</b> the bark into the hopper. He {{did not like the}} work, and he escaped from it when he could, and did jobs of wagoning about the village. He loved his horses and kept them sleek and fat; and it is told of him that when he first traded horses he was so eager to get a certain colt that he offered the man even more than he asked. He was fond of all boyish sports, but he was never rough, or profane, or foul-mouthed, and he was noted among his mates for his truth and honesty. The girls liked him for his gentleness, the younger {{children}} for his kindness; he never teased them, and he never tormented any living creature. There may have been better boys, but I have never heard of them; and if Grant passed only his first seventeen years in his native state, they were years of as true a greatness relatively as any that followed. From the first he was self-reliant, and taught himself to trust to his own powers and resources. When seven years old, he got an unbroken colt from the stable in his father's absence, hitched it to a sled which he loaded with wood in the forest, and then drove home with a single line. He once wished to ride his father's pacer on an errand he was sent upon; but his father could not spare it and the boy took his colt. [...] "I will break him to pace," [...] he said, and he came back with the colt pacing. At twelve he hauled logs with a heavy draft team. Once the men who were to load for him did not come, and Grant managed {{with the help of a}} fallen tree to get the logs on the truck alone and drove home with them. After eleven he had scarcely any schooling except that of hard work, until he was appointed to West Point.|$|R
