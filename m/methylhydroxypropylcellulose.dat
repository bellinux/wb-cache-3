40|$|The {{formulations}} of washing cosmetics i. e. shower gels, containing extracts obtained during supercritical CO 2 extraction process as active ingredient, were developed. The {{subject of the}} study was the analysis of the physicochemical and user properties of the obtained products. In the work supercritical CO 2 extracts of black currant seeds, strawberry seeds, hop cones and mint leafs were used. The formulation contains a mixture of surfactants (disodium cocoamphodiacetate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, cocoamide DEA, cocoamidepropyl betaine, Sodium Laureth Sulfate). Various thickener agents were applied to the obtained desired rheological properties of the cosmetics. Among others, sorbitol acetal derivatives, <b>methylhydroxypropylcellulose</b> and C 10 - 30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer were used. For stable products, the effect of extracts addition (black currants seeds, strawberries seeds, mint and hops, obtained from supercritical CO 2 extraction process) on the cosmetics properties, such as pH, viscosity, detergency and foam ability, were determined. The obtained results showed that the extracts could be used as components of shower gels...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop an {{injectable}} bone substitute (IBS) for percutaneous orthopedic surgery. The multiphasic material used was composed of a 2 % aqueous solution of <b>methylhydroxypropylcellulose</b> (MHPC) and biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP, 60 % hydroxyapatite and 40 % beta-tricalcium phosphate) in which MHPC served as the carrier for 80 - 200 microm of BCP granules. The best BCP/polymer ratio was determined by the rheological properties and higher BCP content of the material. Steam sterilization was more effective than gamma irradiation in maintaining the stability of the mixture and conserving its physiochemical and mechanical properties. The in vitro biocompatibility of the composite was checked by direct-contact cytotoxicity and cell-proliferation assays. A preliminary in vivo test was performed in the rabbit using intraosseous implantations in the femoral epiphysis. Histological analysis was done after 1, 2, 4, and 10 weeks. Bone ingrowth into the IBS, in close association with BCP granules, was observed after 1 week and increased regularly from the surface inward at 2, 4, and 10 weeks. At the same time, smaller BCP granules (less than 80 microns in diameter) were degraded and resorbed. This injectable biomaterial proved suitable for cavity filling. The water solubility and viscosity of the polymer allow cells to recolonize, with in situ bonding of the mineral phase...|$|E
40|$|The {{test item}} was a {{synthetic}} amorphous silica (SAS) coded NM- 200 and {{available at the}} EU JRC nanomaterials repository. It is a nanostructured, precipitated SAS. As NM- 200 is used as an ingredient in food it was {{the objective of this}} study to evaluate oral toxicity. The toxicity of NM- 200 after daily oral gavage in male rats for 28 days with an additional 14 -day recovery period (OECD TG 407; in addition: Si ion and Si particle analysis in selected organs) was tested. Dose levels of 100, 300 and 1000 mg/kg bw (vehicle: 0. 5 % <b>methylhydroxypropylcellulose)</b> were used. Extra groups (control recovery; high dose recovery) were kept for additional 14 days of post-observation. Body weights, food consumption, the functional observational battery (FOB) and hematology and clinical chemistry did not reveal any treatment-related effects. Also organ weights, necropsy, and histopathological examination did not show any substance-related findings in the high dose group, as compared to controls. Chemical analysis of silicon ions in blood, kidney and liver tissues did not reveal differences between the control and the high dose group. As a result, NM- 200 did not cause any substance-related effects at doses up to 1000 mg/kg b. w. after oral exposure for 28 days in male Wistar (WU) rats. Therefore, the highest dose tested (1000 mg/kg b. w.) was determined to represent the NOAEL in this study. By exemplary TEM analysis no particles of NM 200 could be detected in selected tissues...|$|E
