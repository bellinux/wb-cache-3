25|$|Daei {{was born}} in Ardabil, Iran and is an Iranian Azerbaijani. Daei {{graduated}} from Sharif University of Technology in <b>Materials</b> <b>Engineering</b> (Metallurgical) with a B.Sc. degree. Born in Ardabil, he played for his hometown club, Esteghlal Ardabil, when he was 19. His next club was Taxirani F.C. in Tehran, where he played for one season, before joining another Tehrani club, Bank Tejarat FC. He stayed four years with Bank Tejarat, missing out on {{a chance to play}} in the J.League due to military service. Daei's fame is attributed mostly to his renowned goal scoring ability. He managed to score frequently for his clubs, although due to the league schedule at the time he did not play many matches per season. His impressive performance at his club finally got results.|$|E

25|$|The Jocotitlán Technological Institute (Tecnológico de Estudios Superiores de Jocotitlán) was {{established}} in 1998 as a public institution for the north of Mexico State. Since its establishment, it {{has contributed to the}} economic development of the Atlacomulco region by allowing access to higher education in the sciences and technology. This has helped create a workforce to sustain and encourage development of industry in the area. The school began with two majors and seventy nine students. By 2015, it had nine majors and over 3,000 students from thirty one of the state’s municipalities. These majors are electro-mechanical engineering, industrial engineering, computer systems engineering, mechatronics, architecture, accounting, business development, chemistry and <b>materials</b> <b>engineering.</b> The campus covers twenty hectares with several classroom buildings, an engineering method laboratory, a library, and various sporting facilities.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{merging of}} the school's two {{engineering}} departments into a single School of Engineering in 1982, new buildings have been continually added as the division expands. Major additions include: the San Diego Supercomputer Center, completed in 1986; Powell-Focht Bioengineering Hall, completed in 2003; and the Structural and <b>Materials</b> <b>Engineering</b> building, completed in 2012. Significant construction work on the previously undeveloped northern part of campus also took place during this time. Two graduate professional schools, the School of Global Policy and Strategy and Rady School of Management, were constructed in the area adjacent to and near the Supercomputer Center, as well as Roosevelt College, a transfer student apartment complex called The Village at Torrey Pines, and the RIMAC athletic facilities. Additionally, the Conrad Prebys Music Center was completed in 2009 {{as part of an}} expanding arts district to house UC San Diego's music department, renowned for its programs in experimental music.|$|E
25|$|Mainly {{known for}} his writings, Vitruvius was himself an architect. In Roman times {{architecture}} was a broader subject than at present including the modern fields of architecture, construction management, construction engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, <b>materials</b> <b>engineering,</b> mechanical engineering, military engineering and urban planning; architectural engineers consider him the first of their discipline, a specialization previously known as technical architecture. Frontinus mentions him {{in connection with the}} standard sizes of pipes. He is often credited as father of architectural acoustics for describing the technique of echeas placement in theaters. The only building, however, that we know Vitruvius to have worked on is one he tells us about, a basilica completed in 19 BC. It was built at Fanum Fortunae, now the modern town of Fano. The Basilica di Fano (to give the building its Italian name) has disappeared so completely that its very site is a matter of conjecture, although various {{attempts have been made to}} visualise it. The early Christian practice of converting Roman basilicae (public buildings) into cathedrals implies the basilica may be incorporated into the cathedral located in Fano.|$|E
