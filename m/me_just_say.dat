500|$|There was one vice-presidential {{debate between}} Congresswoman Ferraro and Vice President George H. W. Bush. Held on , {{the result was}} proclaimed mostly even by the press and historians; women voters tended to think Ferraro had won, while men, Bush. At it, Ferraro criticized Reagan's initial refusal to support an {{extension}} to the Voting Rights Act. Her experience was questioned at the debate and she was asked how her three terms in Congress stacked up with Bush's extensive government experience. To one Bush statement she said, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> first of all, that I almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude {{that you have to}} teach me about foreign policy." [...] She strongly defended her position on abortion, which earned her applause and a respectful reply from her opponent. In {{the days leading up to}} the debate, Second Lady of the United States Barbara Bush had publicly referred to Ferraro as [...] "that four-million-dollar—I can't say it, but it rhymes with 'rich'." [...] Barbara Bush soon apologized.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have had}} from {{you a very}} noble and {{beautiful}} letter, which has given me exceeding great joy, and which I have only not sooner thanked you for--well, by reason of many interruptions and preoccupations--mainly those resulting from my being in London (the hourly importunate) {{when it came to}} me; at which seasons, and during which sojourns, I always put off as much correspondence as possible till I get back to this comparative peace. (I returned here, but three days since.) How shall I tell you, at any rate, today, how your letter touches and even, as it were, relieves me? I had felt like such a Backward Brute in writing mine, but now in communication with your treasures of indulgence and generosity, I feel only your admirable virtue and the high price I set upon your friendship. So I thank you, all tenderly, and assure you that you have poured balm on much of my anxiety, not to say on my shame. Your account of those unimaginable weeks of your great crisis are of a thrilling and uplifting interest--and yet everything remains unimaginable to me--as to the sense of your whole actual situation; and the lurid newspapers, on all this, do nothing but darken and distract my vision. I hope you are living in less of a pandemonium than they, basest afflictions of our afflicted age, give you out to be--but verily the bridge of comprehension is strained and shaky and impassable between this little old-world russet shore and your vertiginous cosmic coast. Let me cling therefore to you, dear Bruce Porter, personally, as to the friend of those three or four all but fabulous antediluvian days, and keep my hands on you tight, till, by gentle insistent pressure, I have made you yield to that delightful possibility of your perhaps at some nearish day presenting yourself here. You speak of it as a discussable thing--it's the cream of your letter. Let <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> once for all you shall have the very eagerest and intensest welcome. Heaven therefore speed the day. I go to the continent for a few weeks--eight or ten, probably at most--a fortnight hence; but return after that to be here in the most continuous fashion for months and months to come--all summer and autumn. You are vividly interesting too on the subject of Fanny Stevenson and her situation--and your picture is filled out a little by my hearing of her as in a rather obscure and inaccessible town [...] "somewhere on the Riviera"; communicating with a friend or two in London in an elusive and deprecative fashion--withholding her address {{so as not to be}} overtaken or met with (apparently.) Poor lady, poor barbarous and merely instinctive lady--ah, what a tangled web we weave! I probably shall fail of seeing her, and yet, with a sneaking kindness for her that I have, shall be sorry wholly to lose her. She won't, I surmise, come to England. But if I see you here I shall repine at nothing. Do manage to be sustained for the gallant pilgrimage--and do let it count a little, for that, that I am here, my dear Bruce Porter, ever so clingingly and constantly yours, ...|$|E
