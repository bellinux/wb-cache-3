5|$|Another {{potential}} health problem is {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes {{the loss of the}} spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the trunk and limbs. Symptoms are normally seen within 3–4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and a shortened life span. A test is offered to detect the genes responsible for SMA.|$|E
5|$|Branches also {{innervate}} <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the perineum and the pelvic floor; namely, the bulbospongiosus and the ischiocavernosus muscles respectively, the levator ani muscle (including the Iliococcygeus, pubococcygeus, puborectalis {{and either}} pubovaginalis in females or puboprostaticus in males) the external anal sphincter (via the inferior anal branch), and {{male or female}} external urethral sphincter.|$|E
5|$|Impaired {{muscle power}} – With {{impairments}} in this category, the force generated by muscles, {{such as the}} <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> one limb, {{one side of the}} body or {{the lower half of the}} body is reduced, (e.g. spinal cord injury, spina bifida, post-polio syndrome).|$|E

5|$|Information {{from the}} {{peripheral}} chemoreceptors is relayed {{to a series}} of interconnected nuclei which comprise the respiratory centres in the medulla oblongata and the pons of the brainstem. This information determines the average rate of ventilation of the alveoli of the lungs, to keep the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood constant. The respiratory centre does so via motor neurons which activate the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> respiration (in particular the diaphragm).|$|E
5|$|The extraocular <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the walrus are well-developed. This and {{its lack}} of orbital roof allow it to {{protrude}} its eyes and see in both a frontal and dorsal direction. However, vision in this species {{appears to be more}} suited for short-range.|$|E
5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves {{control all}} intrinsic <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the larynx {{except for the}} cricothyroid muscle. These muscles act to open, close, and adjust the tension of the vocal cords, and include the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, the only muscle to open the vocal cords. The nerves supply muscles {{on the same side}} of the body, with the exception of the interarytenoid muscle, which is innervated from both sides.|$|E

5|$|The {{weakness}} from LEMS typically {{involves the}} <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the proximal {{arms and legs}} (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the bulbar muscles (<b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{the brain}} (such as from a massive stroke, {{non-penetrating}} head injury, intoxication or poisoning) {{may result in a}} depressed level of consciousness. When this becomes severe to the point of stupor or coma (defined as a score on the Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 8), dynamic collapse of the extrinsic <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the airway can obstruct the airway, impeding the free flow of air into the lungs. Furthermore, protective airway reflexes such as coughing and swallowing may be diminished or absent. Tracheal intubation is often required to restore patency (the relative absence of blockage) of the airway and protect the tracheobronchial tree from pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.|$|E
5|$|Emus are farmed {{primarily}} for their meat, leather, feathers and oil, and 95% of the carcass can be used. Emu meat is a low-fat product (less than 1.5% fat), and {{is comparable to}} other lean meats. Most of the usable portions (the best cuts come from the thigh and the larger <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the drum or lower leg) are, like other poultry, dark meat; emu meat is considered for cooking purposes by the US Food and Drug Administration to be a red meat because its red colour and pH value approximate that of beef, but for inspection purposes it {{is considered to be}} poultry.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} support the robust head, the neck of Hatzegopteryx was likely {{strongly}} muscled. On the occipital bones, the nuchal lines, which serve as muscular attachments, are very well-developed and bear prominent scars. These conceivably supported the transversospinalis muscles, which aid in extension and flexion {{of the head and}} neck. Likewise, the opisthotic process, neural spines, and zygapophyses all appeared to have been large and robust (with the latter bearing many pits and edges that likely represent muscle scars), and the basioccipital tuberosities were long; these all serve as points of attachment for various <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the head and neck. Although not entirely unmuscled, the neck of Arambourgiania probably would not have been as extensively muscled as that of Hatzegopteryx.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is rounded. The central groove in {{the nasal}} {{depression}} (the lowered {{area at the}} nose) is relatively broad in comparison to M.manavi. The frontal bones (part of the skull roof) bear a well-developed sagittal crest (a crest that provides support for <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the head). Further back on the braincase, the lambdoid crest (another such crest) is also prominent. The middle part of the palate is concave, as in M.brachytragos and M.mahafaliensis, but unlike in M.aelleni and M.manavi, which have a flat palate. At the palate's back margin is a long, robust posterior palatal spine.|$|E
5|$|Paralytic {{shellfish}} poisoning (PSP) {{is primarily}} {{caused by the}} consumption of bivalves that have accumulated toxins by feeding on toxic dinoflagellates, single-celled protists found naturally in the sea and inland waters. Saxitoxin is the most virulent of these. In mild cases, PSP causes tingling, numbness, sickness and diarrhoea. In more severe cases, the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the chest wall may be affected leading to paralysis and even death. In 1937, researchers in California established the connection between blooms of these phytoplankton and PSP. The biotoxin remains potent even when the shellfish are well-cooked. In the United States, there is a regulatory limit of 80µg/g of saxitoxin equivalent in shellfish meat.|$|E

5|$|Parasitic {{protozoa}} of {{the genus}} Sarcocystis have been recovered from the smooth <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> adult American white ibis, and another species, Haemoproteus plataleae, has been recovered from the blood of adults and nestlings, and can hence be transmitted before the young leave the nest. The larvae of two species of mite of the family Hypoderidae, Phalacrodectes whartoni and Neoattialges eudocimae, have been recovered from under the skin. Two species of the louse suborder Mallophaga, Plegadiphilus eudocimus and Ardeicola robusta, also parasitise the bird.|$|E
5|$|The SA node {{is found}} in all amniotes but not in more {{primitive}} vertebrates. In these animals, the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the heart are relatively continuous and the sinus venosus coordinates the beat which passes in a wave through the remaining chambers. Indeed, since the sinus venosus is incorporated into the right atrium in amniotes, it is likely homologous with the SA node. In teleosts, with their vestigial sinus venosus, the main centre of coordination is, instead, in the atrium. The rate of heartbeat varies enormously between different species, ranging from around 20 beats per minute in codfish to around 600 in hummingbirds and up to 1200 bpm in the ruby-throated hummingbird.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome are numbness, tingling, and pain, {{alone or in}} combination. This is followed by weakness of the legs and arms that affects both sides equally and worsens over time. The weakness can take half a day to over two weeks to reach maximum severity, and then becomes steady. In one in five people, the weakness continues to progress {{for as long as}} four weeks. The <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the neck may also be affected, and about half experience involvement of the cranial nerves which supply the head and face; this may lead to weakness of the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the face, swallowing difficulties and sometimes weakness of the eye muscles. In 8%, the weakness affects only the legs (paraplegia or paraparesis). Involvement of the muscles that control the bladder and anus is unusual. In total, about a third of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome continue to be able to walk. Once the weakness has stopped progressing, it persists at a stable level ("plateau phase") before improvement occurs. The plateau phase can take between two days and six months, but the most common duration is a week. Pain-related symptoms affect more than half, and include back pain, painful tingling, muscle pain and pain {{in the head and neck}} relating to irritation of the lining of the brain.|$|E

40|$|At 5 degrees C four {{strains of}} fermentative, gram-negative {{bacteria}} (Serratia liquefaciens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Enterobacter cloacae, and Aeromonas hydrophila) grew aerobically and anaerobically on adipose tissue removed from beef <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> low pH (5. 4 to 5. 6).

However, {{none of the}} four grew anaerobically on beef <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> low pH, and the aeromonad strain also failed to grow aerobically on such <b>muscle.</b> Growth <b>of</b> S. liquefaciens and E. cloacae on vacuum-packaged beef muscle was dependent on the pH of the tissue and the oxygen transmission rate of the packaging film. Although the four strains grew in broth buffered at pH 5. 55, L-lactate, at the concentration found in <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> low pH (ca. 100 mM), prevented anaerobic growth of all four isolates and prevented the aerobic growth of th aeromonad.

5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the tongue, {{except for the}} palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem {{as a number of}} small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two {{hypoglossal nerve}}s in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves, {{a group of}} nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens nerve (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve (third and fourth nerve palsy, respectively) are affected; both {{play a role in}} eye movements. The facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve) is affected occasionally –- the result is total or partial weakness of the <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> facial expression on one or both sides of the face.|$|E
5|$|The lumbar (or lower back) {{region is}} made up of five {{vertebrae}} (L1–L5), sometimes including the sacrum. In between these vertebrae are fibrocartilaginous discs, which act as cushions, preventing the vertebrae from rubbing together {{while at the same time}} protecting the spinal cord. Nerves come from and go to the spinal cord through specific openings between the vertebrae, providing the skin with sensations and messages to muscles. Stability of the spine is provided by the ligaments and <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> the back and abdomen. Small joints called facet joints limit and direct the motion of the spine.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{intramuscular}} adipogenesis and fibrogenesis may concomitantly occur in skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> beef cattle. Thus, we hypothesized that the discrepancy of intramuscular fat content in beef from Nellore and Angus was associated with differences in intramuscular adipogenesis and fibrogenesis during the finishing phase. To test our hypothesis, longissimus <b>muscle</b> samples <b>of</b> Nellore (n = 6; BW = 372. 5 ± 37. 3 kg) and Angus (n = 6; BW = 382. 8 ± 23. 9 kg) cattle were collected for analysis of gene and protein expression, and quantification of intramuscular fat and collagen. Least-squares means were estimated for the effect of Breed and differences were considered at P ≤ 0. 05. A greater intramuscular fat content was observed in skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> Angus compared to Nellore cattle (P≤ 0. 05).

Similarly, no differences were observed in mRNA expression of adipogenic markers Zfp 423, PPARγ, and C/EBPα (P> 0. 05) However, a greater PPARγ protein content was observed in skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> Angus compared to Nellore cattle (P≤ 0. 05). A greater abundance of adipo/fibrogenic cells, evaluated by the PDGFRα content, was observed in skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> Angus than Nellore cattle (P≤ 0. 05). No differences in fibrogenesis were observed in skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> Angus and Nellore cattle, which is {{in accordance with the}} lack of differences in intramuscular collagen content in beef from both breeds (P> 0. 05).
