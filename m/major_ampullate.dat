40|$|Spider minor ampullate silk is {{a strong}} non-elastic deformably {{stretchable}} silk used in web formation. This silk from Nephila clavipes is composed of two proteins, MiSp 1 and 2, whose transcripts are 9. 5 and 7. 5 kb, respectively, as determined by Northern blots. Both MiSp proteins are organized into a predominantly repetitive region and a small nonrepetitive carboxy terminal region. These highly repetitive regions are composed mainly of glycine and alanine, but also contain tyrosine, glutamine, and arginine. The sequences are mainly GGX and GA repeats. The repetitive regions are interrupted by nonrepetitive serine-rich spacer regions. Although the sequences of the spacer regions differ from the repetitive regions, sequences of the spacers from {{different regions of the}} proteins are nearly identical. The sequence differences between <b>major</b> and minor <b>ampullate</b> silks may explain the differing mechanical properties of the fibers...|$|R
40|$|A rather {{extensive}} {{review of}} various subjects {{related to this}} experimental study has been given in efforts to garner necessary understanding from the disrelation of two capcious fields, namely spider silk biology and high-rate mechanical testing. Thus, a review of tensile Kolsky bar testing is performed, being followed by analysis of previous high-performance fiber testing. Subsequent review of environmental conditions effecting spider silk mechanical properties is performed and current understanding of silk microstructure is addressed. Assessment of fracture morphology is given, with the review concluding on discussion of previous studies which inconclusively ascertained the rate effect on mechanical properties of spider dragline silk. Following, both quasi-static and high-rate tensile properties have been determined for <b>Major</b> and Minor <b>Ampullate</b> single silk fibers derived from the orb weaving spider Nephila Clavipes. Low rate tests have been performed using a DMA Q 800 at 0. 001 while high rate analysis has been accomplished at 1700 /s utilizing a previously established miniature Kolsky bar apparatus. Rate effects exhibited by both respective silk types are addressed and direct comparison of the tensile response between the two fibers is made. Mechanical properties of these organic silks are contrasted to currently employed ballistic fibers and a performance prediction of biomemetic silk capabilities is addressed. Analysis of the MA and MI fiber microstructure is explored {{by a number of}} techniques in efforts to determine the presence of a fibrillar core-skin architecture. Examination of fiber fracture mechanisms are probed via scanning electron microscope, revealing a globular rupture surface topography. Furthermore, MA silk is subjected to a focused ion beam in efforts to remove the outer skin housing, resulting in subsurface topography investigation. Finally, MA silk is set, infiltrated, and cut in a fashion so as to image the inner structure via Transmission Electron Microscopy, yielding a definite skin-core morphology. ...|$|R
40|$|The silk fibres spun by {{insects and}} spiders have {{intrigued}} scientists for many years. Their mechanical performance is remarkable {{when one considers}} that the fibres are spun under ambient conditions from aqueous protein solutions without requiring many of the harsh processing conditions used in the production of man-made fibres. Yet, despite this interest, very {{little is known about the}} initial structure of the precursor proteins prior to spinning. One reason for this lies in the difficulty of handling the native proteins without accidental aggregation. Therefore in this thesis a novel sample preparation protocol for native silk is developed and small angle scattering (SAS) techniques are combined with circular dichroism (CD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to examine the structure and morphology of the proteins with different mechanical properties and thus biological function in nature. This work highlights the importance of studying native, functional proteins, at close to in vivo conditions, since clear differences in the structure and interaction of native and reconstituted silks can be attributed to the additional processing which reconstituted silks have undergone in order to be solubilised. Indeed native silk proteins are found to be more inherently non-interacting at quite high protein concentrations than reconstituted silk. Upon dilution, inter-chain interactions can be observed by SAS and CD as the protein is driven from its equilibrium conformation. This interaction and the shear-induced assembly of these proteins are also followed by AFM. Interestingly, native silk proteins from spider and silkworms retain a semiflexible conformation in solution. Indeed by comparing the silks from the <b>major</b> and minor <b>ampullate,</b> flagelliform and cylindriform glands of Nephila edulis with the cocoon silk of Bombyx mori silkworms, important insights are gained into how their flexibility suggests similarities in the local environment of the protein chains thereby dictating the hierarchical structure of silk fibres.

50|$|<b>Major</b> <b>ampullate</b> spidroins {{are large}} {{proteins}} with {{an extension of}} 250-350 kDa, {{with an average of}} 3500 amino acids. They represent a polymeric organization, mostly based on highly homogenized tandem repeats. There are 100 tandem copies of 30 to 40 amino acids which repeat sequence and they represent more than 90% of the protein sequence. Alanine and glycine residues are the most abundant. Alanine appears in blocks of six to fourteen units that form β-sheets. These alanine blocks can stack to create crystalline structures in the fiber, linking different protein molecules together. Glycine is present in different motifs, such as GGX and GPGXX (where X = A, L, Q, or Y), that also have specific secondary structures (3 10 helix and β-spiral, respectively). Glycine-rich regions are more amorphous and contribute to extensibility and flexibility. Some of the differences observed between spidroin 1 and spidroin 2 (the most important <b>major</b> <b>ampullate</b> spidroins) are the proline content, which is very low in the first one but significant in the second one, and the motifs. Motif (GGX)n is characteristic in spidroin 1, while GPG and QQ are typical in spidroin 2.|$|E

40|$|The {{morphology}} of silk {{produced by}} recluse spiders (Loxosceles arizonica) was investigated by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. This silk consisted entirely of very long, thin ribbons of width 2 • 4 pirn and thicknesses {{of no more}} than 40 nm. The corre-spondence in shape and dimension between the silk ribbons and the elongated aperture of the <b>major</b> <b>ampullate</b> spigot indicated that these ribbons were <b>major</b> <b>ampullate</b> silk.

40|$|Spidroin- 1 {{is one of}} the <b>major</b> <b>ampullate</b> silk {{proteins}} {{produced by}} spiders for use {{in the construction of the}} frame and radii of orb webs, and as a dragline to escape from predators. Only partial sequences of spidroin- 1 produced by Nephila clavipes have been reported up to now, and there is no information on post-translational modifications (PTMs). A gel-based mass spectrometry strategy with ETD and CID fragmentation methods were used to sequence and determine the presence/location of any PTMs on the spidroin- 1. Sequence coverage of 98. 06 %, 95. 05 %, and 98. 37 % were obtained for N. clavipes, Nephila edulis and for Nephila madagascariensis, respectively. Phosphorylation was the major PTM observed with 8 phosphorylation sites considered reliable on spidroin- 1 produced by N. clavipes, 4 in N. madagascariensis and 2 for N. edulis. Dityrosine and 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (formed by oxidation of the spidroin- 1) were observed, although the mechanism by which they are formed (i. e. exposure to UV radiation or to peroxidases in the <b>major</b> <b>ampullate</b> silk gland) is uncertain. Herein we present structural information on the spidroin- 1 produced by three different Nephila species; these findings may be valuable for understanding the physicochemical properties of the silk proteins and moreover, future designs of recombinantly produced spider silk proteins. Biotechnological significance: The present investigation shows for the first time spidroin structure and post-translational modifications observed on the <b>major</b> <b>ampullate</b> silk spidroin- 1.
