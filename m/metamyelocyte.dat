5000|$|The common myeloid {{progenitor}} can differentiate in {{the bone}} marrow into red blood cells and megakaryocytes (leading to platelets) as well as mast cells and myeloblasts, the latter leading to the myelocytic line (granulocytes) and to monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells of the innate immune system. The granulocytes, also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes because of their multilobed nuclei, are three short lived cell types including eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils. A granulocyte differentiates into a distinct cell type by a process called granulopoiesis. In this process it first transforms from a common myeloblast (myeloid progenitor) to a common promyelocyte. This promyelocyte {{gives rise to a}} unique myelocyte {{that for the first time}} can be classified as an eosinophil, basophil, or neutrophil progenitor based on the histological staining affinity (eosinophilic, basophilic, or neutral granules). The unique myelocyte next differentiates into a <b>metamyelocyte</b> and then a band cell, with a [...] "C" [...] shaped nucleus, before becoming a mature eosinophil, basophil, or neutrophil. Macrophages come from monoblast progenitors that differentriate into promonocytes, which mature into monocytes. Monocytes eventually enter the tissues and become macrophages.|$|E
40|$|Introduction In {{pernicious anemia}} besides the {{presence}} of megaloblasts in the bone marrow, changes in myeloid series were seen; being the most evident among the <b>metamyelocyte.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to perform the quantification of <b>metamyelocyte</b> of the bone marrow in pernicious anemia. Material and methods Between 2000 - 2006 in the Clinic of Hematology-Niš, 68 patients with pernicious anemia were examined and 30 with dyspeptic syndrome (control group). The group of patients with pernicious anemia in relation to pathohistologic changes of gastric mucosa was divided into three sub-groups. Morphometrical analysis of <b>metamyelocyte</b> of the bone marrow was carried out by the application of the double netlike system (B 100). The following parameters were used: relative surface, contour length, absolute surface of nucleus and cytoplasm, absolute contour nucleus and cytoplasm density, shaped nucleus and cytoplasmic factor and nuclear-cytoplasmatic ratio of meta- myelocytes. Results Relative surface, contour length, absolute surface and contour density of nucleus and cytoplasm of metamyelocytes increased simultaneously with the degree of atrophic gastritis. Shaped nucleus and cytoplasmic factor and nuclear-cytoplasmatic ratio of metamyelocytes decreased in all examined groups in relation to the control group. Conclusion Not only are bone marrow erythroid elements scoped with megaloblastic changes but the changes on the level of leukocyte cells as well.

40|$|Objectives The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to identify and evaluate the cellular granulocytic series of bone marrow in goat that aids to diagnose bone marrow from a variety of clinical disorders in the field of medicine. Methods Five adult goats were used in {{this research}}. These animals are obtained from the Animal’s Field in the College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Al-Fallujah. Results The first indication of the granulocytic series begins from Myeloblast, which possesses eccentric, round or oval nucleus that surrounded by a rim of cytoplasm. The smaller nucleus leads to identify the Promyelocyte. The cytoplasm of Promyelocyte is very light. Definitive granulations appear within the cytoplasm of Myelocyte, which has round to oval nucleus. The elongation of the nucleus indicates the <b>Metamyelocyte.</b> This cell shows the neutrophilic, eosinophilic and basophilic <b>Metamyelocyte.</b> A large segment of a circle or twisted nucleus represent the Band cell. The last stage of granulocytic series is the segmented cell, which is illustrated by segmented neutrophil, eosinophils, and basophils.

40|$|Mutational {{activation}} of RAS {{is the most}} common molecular abnormality in myeloid leukemias. In order to better understand its role in leukemogenesis, we have devised a model based on the multipotent cell line, FDCP-mix. We show that expression of mutant RAS in FDCP-mix strongly inhibits terminal neutrophil differentiation under the influence of G-CSF plus GM-CSF at the <b>metamyelocyte</b> stage, whereas macrophage differentiation was unaffected. In addition, whereas control cultures differentiated and became postmitotic under these conditions, FDCP-mix cells expressing mutant RAS continued to proliferate indefinitely while maintaining a metamyelocytic phenotype. Labeling of these cultures with the fluorescent tracking dye, PKH 26, showed that this extended proliferative capacity resulted from continued division of metamyelocytes in the culture. Dissection of the growth factor response of these cells demonstrated that GM-CSF was critical in maintaining proliferation and inhibiting the differentiation of these cells. We further show the block in neutrophil differentiation could be partially overcome by treatment with low-dose Ara C, suggesting that maintenance of cell cycle progression may be partly responsible for the anti-differentiation effect of this oncogene. These findings suggest that {{activation of}} RAS is able to specifically inhibit terminal neutrophil differentiation and in so doing promotes continued division of <b>metamyelocyte</b> cells...|$|E

Surprisingly, bone marrow of beige mice had significant elastase and cathepsin G activity (approximately 60 % of normal). The results of several experiments indicate that neutrophils were the sole source of elastase and cathepsin G in bone marrow. Neutral proteinase activity was readily demonstrable by histochemical procedures in beige marrow neutrophil precursors up to and including the <b>metamyelocyte</b> stage. However, mature neutrophils of beige marrow had greatly decreased activity. Also mature neutrophils (PMNs) of the peripheral circulation, like peritoneal neutrophils, had very low elastase and cathepsin C activities.

30|$|Neutrophil {{granules}} {{are designated}} {{based on their}} content and order of production during BM development. Primary or azurophilic granules are formed at {{the early stages of}} neutrophil lineage formation in the BM (myeloblast to promyelocyte) and contain the potent proteases neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G, the chlorinating enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO), and defensins. Secondary or specific granules arise at the later <b>metamyelocyte</b> stage and are characterized by the presence of lactoferrin, collagenase, carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule family members CD 66 a and CD 66 b, and the antiprotease cystatin C. Tertiary or gelatinase granules appear at the band cell stage, right before the final segmented stage of neutrophil BM development, and enclose lysozyme and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP 9). Secretory vesicles are present only in mature neutrophils and are thought to be produced by endocytosis of surface expressed proteins, enabling their rapid redeployment at the surface upon activation, as exemplified by the upregulation of PRR surface expression upon priming in blood [48, 49]. Mobilization of secretory vesicles followed by tertiary and secondary granules appears to be a default activation path for neutrophils. By contrast, primary granules generally fuse either with the phagosome or the nucleus [50], the latter being part of the recently discovered NETotic fate of neutrophils. During NETosis, DNA is decondensed, released along with histones, and complexed with cationic primary granule proteins (chiefly NE and MPO), thus forming extracellular traps endowed with antimicrobial activities [51].|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} Fc receptors for IgG (Fc gamma R) {{have been}} identified on human leukocytes: a high avidity receptor (Fc gamma Rhi) present on monocytes but not on neutrophils, and a low avidity receptor (Fc gamma Rlo) present on neutrophils but not on monocytes. Fc gamma Rlo can be inhibited and the receptor precipitated by monoclonal antibody 3 G 8. We have used this monoclonal antibody to study the course of Fc gamma Rlo appearance on bone marrow cells, leukocytes of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and HL- 60 and U 937 cells induced to differentiate with agents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), retinoic acid, phorbol myristate acetate, and lymphokine. We report that Fc gamma Rlo is a late differentiation antigen, first expressed at the <b>metamyelocyte</b> stage. Since precursors to metamyelocytes bear Fc gamma R, and the promyelocyte line HL- 60 bears Fc gamma Rhi, {{there must be a}} progressive loss of Fc gamma Rhi during myeloid differentiation and the reciprocal expression of Fc gamma Rlo. Results of immunoprecipitation and polyacrylamide gel analysis of the proteins are consistent with these results. We have also studied the receptor for the C 3 bi complement component (CR 3), which is blocked and immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibody OKM 10. During DMSO-driven differentiation of HL- 60 cells, we find that CR 3 is induced on all cells, whereas Fc gamma Rlo is induced on only 24 % of cells, suggesting that CR 3 appears earlier during differentiation than Fc gamma Rlo does...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{examined}} hFc gamma RI expression during myelopoiesis. Normal bone marrow (BM) cells were found to express hFc gamma RI up to the <b>metamyelocyte</b> stage. A different Fc gamma RI expression pattern was observed in an in vitro model of myelopoiesis. Purified CD 34 -positive BM cells, cultured for 12 to 14 days with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), differentiate into a population of mature granulocytic cells. In these cultures, in which hFc gamma RI was virtually absent on the initial CD 34 -positive BM cells, hFc gamma RI was strongly induced by G-CSF after only 5 days. During final maturation the cells remained hFc gamma RI positive. This expression was confirmed functionally by antibody-sensitized erythrocytes (EA) -rosette assays. Moreover, the mature myeloid cells were found to express mRNA encoding for hFc gamma RI, whereas reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that both hFc gamma RIA and hFc gamma RIB genes were expressed. In contrast, on peripheral blood (PB) polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes (PMN) the in vitro effect of G-CSF as to hFc gamma RI induction was limited. Therefore, we conclude that, with respect to hFc gamma RI expression on PMN, G-CSF acts on myeloid precursor cells rather than on mature cells. This conclusion could be strengthened by in vivo administration of a single dose of G-CSF to a healthy volunteer. After a 12 -hour lag time, hFc gamma RI expressing PMNs were detected in the peripheral blood. This study shows that hFc gamma RI is an early myeloid differentiation marker that is lost during normal final maturation. However, committed myeloid progenitor cells can be strongly induced by G-CSF to express hFc gamma RI, ultimately resulting in mature granulocytic cells expressing the high-affinity receptor for IgG. This expression may have important consequences for the functional capacity of these cell...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: To {{understand}} the gene expression of CAP 18 (18 -kDa cationic antibacterial protein), {{a member of}} cathelicidins, we evaluated mRNA and protein expression of CAP 18 using human bone marrow cells and mature neutrophils. Northern blot analysis revealed that CAP 18 mRNA was expressed more abundantly in bone marrow cells than mature neutrophils, whereas Western blot analysis indicated that CAP 18 protein was more abundant in mature neutrophils than bone marrow cells. Consistent with this, in situ hybridization using bone marrow cells demonstrated that the expression of CAP 18 mRNA was neutrophil lineage-specific and was observed primarily in myelocytes (G 95 %) with limited expression in more immature cells (promyelocytes) and mature cells (<b>metamyelocytes,</b> band cells, and segmented neutrophils). Furthermore, immunohistochemical study indicated that, coincident {{with the increase of}} CAP 18 mRNA levels, CAP 18 -positive cells increased markedly at myelocyte stage, and the increased levels remained almost constant (G 95 %) in <b>metamyelocytes,</b> band cells, and segmented neutrophils, although the mRNA levels were remarkably reduced in these cells. Together these observations indicate that CAP 18 gene transcription likely occurs lineageand stage-specifically at the myelocyte stage of neutrophil maturation in the bone marrow and results in the synthesis and cytoplasmic accumulation of CAP 18, which is present in the subsequent stages of neutrophil maturation.

40|$|The leucopenia {{induced by}} sodium nucleinate has been {{followed}} by repeated counts made simultaneously from the blood of a peripheral vein and from the internal organs, combined with a study of histological sections of the same organs taken with the counts. Measurements with the oncometer of changes in volume of the spleen have been correlated with the leucopenia and the leucocytosis following sodium nucleinate. It has thus been determined that the leucopenia is {{not the result of}} a vasomotor phenomenon, or of a change in blood volume, nor is it secondary to a retention of the white cells in the capillaries of lung or liver; it is due to the accumulation of neutrophilic leucocytes in the parenchyma of the spleen. That the spleen is solely responsible for the temporary depression of white cells in the general circulation under these conditions has been shown by splenectomy. In splenectomized rabbits no leucopenia developed, but instead a leucocytosis due to a direct action on the bone marrow. A profound change occurs in the distribution of the cells in the circulation at the moment of death. The liver, within a minute of the cessation of the circulation, shows a three- to fourfold {{increase in the number of}} white cells per c. mm., the differential count remaining unchanged. Thus estimations of the physiological distribution and redistribution of cells in the living state may be made only with the circulation unimpaired. The injection into normal rabbits of adenine and guanine nucleotides, split products of nucleic acid, gave immediate leucocytosis of bone marrow origin similar to that observed with the more complex molecule when the spleen was eliminated. The response of the bone marrow to chemotactic stimuli, such as those have used, may be reflected in the general circulation, through an absolute increase of young neutrophilic leucocytes, within a period of less than 1 hour. Within this brief period there takes place maturation from Myelocyte C and <b>metamyelocyte</b> into the early motile leucocyte, and the delivery of these just matured cells into the circulation.

A variety of “flagging ” criteria are in place to trigger a smear review for confirmation of automated results and for the detection of other qualitative cell abnormalities (See below). Technical improvements led to the ability of automated hematology analyzers to accurately distinguish mature functional segmented and band neutrophils from immature <b>metamyelocytes</b> and younger neutrophils. The hematology analyzer makes this distinction based on a biochemical difference rather than morphologic features. IGs have higher levels of RNA than bands and segmented neutrophils are detected based on their affinity for a polymethine fluorescent dye 2 (Fig- 1). The hematology lab analyzer is not capable of distinguishing bands from segmented neutrophils since bands lack elevated amounts of RNA; hence both cell types are reported as “neutrophils. ” The principle behind quantifying IGs is very similar to the principle behind measuring immature RBC (i. e.
