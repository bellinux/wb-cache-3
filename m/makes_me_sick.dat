While trying {{to dispose of}} Alejandro's car, Bree and Gabrielle inadvertently attract Chuck's attention and {{have to create a}} series of elaborate lies to avoid him finding out the truth. Later, Bree receives a note reading, [...] "I know what you did. It <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>sick.</b> I'm going to tell."

500|$|In another {{review in}} The New York Times John Leonard wrote {{that while the}} book has its strong points, [...] "some wit, a catholic disdain, {{multiplicity}} of character and a South American swamp-life that terrifies", its weaknesses are that [...] "the characters are really ideas,... the symbols clash and {{there are too many}} echoes of better books by Kafka and Proust". But Leonard's biggest criticism of the book was Hitler's speech, which he called [...] "obscene", and Steiner's decision to end the book at that point, which Leonard said [...] "not only denies the power of art to arrange and transcend, but... <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>sick</b> to my stomach." ...|$|E

500|$|Stanley was a {{powerful}} orator who used dramatic flourishes to emphasize his points. He would often loosen his tie before he ever started speaking, {{and by the end}} of his speech have thrown off his vest and coat. In one instance, the candidates debated a tax on dog owners of one dollar per dog. Stanley favored the tax, while Morrow contended that everyone should be allowed one dog tax-free. Stanley ridiculed the idea as [...] "Free Old Dog Ring," [...] and sometimes howled like a dog in speeches deriding the proposal. On another occasion Stanley, who had too much to drink, vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke. When Stanley took the podium, he remarked, [...] "That just goes to show you what I have been saying all over Kentucky. Ed Morrow plain <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>sick</b> to my stomach." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1822, {{the first}} animal {{protection}} law was enacted in the British parliament, {{followed by the}} Cruelty to Animals Act (1876), the first law specifically aimed at regulating animal testing. The legislation was promoted by Charles Darwin, who wrote to Ray Lankester in March 1871: [...] "You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite {{agree that it is}} justifiable for real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>sick</b> with horror, so I will not say another word about it, else I shall not sleep to-night." [...] In response to the lobbying by anti-vivisectionists, several organizations were set up in Britain to defend animal research: The Physiological Society was formed in 1876 to give physiologists [...] "mutual benefit and protection", the Association for the Advancement of Medicine by Research was formed in 1882 and focused on policy-making, and the Research Defence Society (now Understanding Animal Research) was formed in 1908 [...] "to make known the facts as to experiments on animals in this country; the immense importance to the welfare of mankind of such experiments and the great saving of human life and health directly attributable to them".|$|E
500|$|Barkley is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of gay rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: [...] "I'm a big advocate of gay marriage. If {{they want to}} get married, God bless them." [...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I hear the word 'conservative,' it <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>sick</b> to my stomach, because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... I think they want to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's none of my business if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white. [...] he talked about equality for every man, every woman. We have a thing going on now, people discriminating against homosexuality in this country. I love the homosexuality people. God bless the gay people. They are great people." ...|$|E

500|$|Paul asks Mary Alice’s {{neighbors and}} friends, Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), Bree (Marcia Cross) and Gabrielle (Eva Longoria), {{to go through}} her clothes and other {{belongings}} and then pack them up, as he thinks {{it will be too}} hard for him. The women end up finding a letter addressed to Mary Alice, a blackmail note reading, [...] "I know what you did, it <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>sick,</b> I’m going to tell." [...] Thereafter, the women make a series of discoveries concerning Mary Alice’s past and her possible motives for ending her life; she was being treated by Dr. Albert Goldfine (Sam Lloyd) where she revealed that she once went by the name Angela, and she may {{have had something to do}} with a baby that went missing. [...] Paul soon discovers who sent Mary Alice the note, their next-door neighbor struggling with financial difficulty, Martha Huber (Christine Estabrook), whom he ends up strangling to death out of pure rage and burying her body in the nearby forest. Meanwhile, her son Zach begins having flashbacks and is under the impression he killed a baby named Dana, who he believed to be his younger sister and reveals this to Julie Mayer (Andrea Bowen), Susan’s daughter. Paul worries over what Susan is spreading about their family, so he tells Susan in private that Zach accidentally killed his younger sister, Dana, and that he and Mary Alice covered it up to protect him. However, it becomes evident that this is not the case when Paul tells Zach that Dana is still very much alive.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the sixth}} game, Michigan {{suffered}} its only loss to Minnesota. Playing on a wet and slippery field, Harmon completed 9 of 14 passes, despite throwing what {{was described as}} [...] "a bar of slippery soap", including a touchdown pass to Evashevski. Harmon missed the extra point kick that left Michigan trailing 7 to 6. Harmon later recalled: [...] "It <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>sick</b> {{to think of the}} chances we blew that day. We should have beaten them by four or five touchdowns. They're a good club, but we're better, and so is Northwestern." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rachels {{writes that}} Darwin noted the moral {{implications}} of the cognitive similarities, arguing that [...] "humanity to the lower animals" [...] {{was one of the}} [...] "noblest virtues with which man is endowed." [...] He was strongly opposed to any kind of cruelty to animals, including setting traps. He wrote in a letter that he supported vivisection for [...] "real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>sick</b> with horror..." [...] In 1875, he testified before a Royal Commission on Vivisection, lobbying for a bill to protect both the animals used in vivisection, and the study of physiology. Rachels writes that the animal rights advocates of the day, such as Frances Power Cobbe, did not see Darwin as an ally.|$|E
