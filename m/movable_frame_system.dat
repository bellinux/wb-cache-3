40|$|A pair of {{equilateral}} tetrahedra {{is formed}} by drawing all the face diagonals of a cube. Holding one tetrahedron fixed, {{the motion of}} the other one is investigated, subject to the constraint that edges formed by the diagonals of the same cube face remain coplanar, i. e., intersect or coincide. Based entirely on the solution of equations arising directly from this constraint, displacement of the movable tetrahedron is expressed as rigid body rotation with translation. This original result forms the foundation upon which kinematic and dynamic analyses are built: (1) Edge pair intersections are expressed in closed, parametric form so as to facilitate further investigation. (2) A closed-form solution for the two degree-of-freedom workspace boundary is obtained by evaluating conditions under which these parameters approach zero or one. This important extension of previous research is necessary to control the motion of any hardware implementation of a double tetrahedral mechanism. (3) Inverse kinematics, which concerns the motion of such a mechanism, is presented. Two kinds of singularity, basic position singularity and overlapping singularity, are discussed {{from the point of view}} of the Jacobian matrices. (4) Given a wrench applied to the <b>movable</b> <b>frame,</b> the <b>system</b> of reactive forces or torques needed at the joints, i. e., the edge intersections, is determined. (5) Using the Lagrangian formulation, the inverse dynamics of this mechanism are derived and simulation results are presented.

50|$|Of similar {{design is}} the {{standard}} beehive used {{in many parts of}} the world for beekeeping. The advantage of this hive is that the bees build honeycomb into frames, which can be moved with ease.

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{variable}} torque generator (VTG) with a movable stator relative to the rotor in the drivetrain of a wind turbine is investigated theoretically and computationally. This feature allows {{the use of a}} larger capacity generator in wind turbines to increase the rated power in high wind speeds and still keep them in operation in even lower than cut-in speed ranges. Thus, by harnessing more wind power throughout the entire power curve of the wind turbine, from the new cut-in speed to the cut-out speed, the efficiency of the wind turbine can be increased. The stator and the frame of the generator can be attached to a <b>movable</b> <b>frame</b> and changes in overlap can be mechanically achieved by a worm and worm gear system connected to the <b>movable</b> <b>frame.</b> Theoretical analyses together with computational methods on several wind turbine generators illustrate the advantages of having VTG feature in terms of decreasing the cut-in speed, increasing the rated power, and at the end improving the efficiency of a wind turbine. The aerodynamic and electromagnetic properties of the wind turbine are combined to make the best estimation on changing in overlap. At the end, simulation and mathematical results are presented and possible advantages of VTG with focus on on-shore wind turbine applications are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Beekeepers {{provide a}} place for the colony to live and store honey. There are seven basic types of beehive: skeps, Langstroth hives, top-bar hives, box hives, log gums, D. E. hive, and miller hives. All U.S. states require beekeepers to use <b>movable</b> <b>frames</b> to allow bee {{inspectors}} to check the brood for disease. This allows beekeepers to keep Langstroth, top-bar and D.E. hives without special permission, granted for purposes such as museum use. Modern hives also enable beekeepers to transport bees, moving from field to field as crops require pollinating (a source of income for beekeepers).|$|R
50|$|Other inventors, notably François Huber in 1789, had {{designed}} hives with frames (the so-called leafe or book hive), but Langstroth's hive was a practical <b>movable</b> <b>frame</b> hive, which overcame {{the tendency of}} the bees to fill empty spaces with comb and to cement smaller spaces together with propolis. In contrast to August von Berlepsch's frame-movable side-opened hive (May 1852, Germany), Langstroth's hive was top-opened, as was the Bevan top-bar hive (1848, UK). These combined adaptations led to the Langstroth hive design being preferred by beekeepers over all others, and his hive is used throughout the world.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, the Langstroth hive is {{commonly}} used. The Langstroth {{was the first}} successful top-opened hive with <b>movable</b> <b>frames.</b> Many other hive designs {{are based on the}} principle of bee space first described by Langstroth. The Langstroth hive is a descendant of Jan Dzierzon’s Polish hive designs. In the United Kingdom, {{the most common type of}} hive is the British National, which can hold Hoffman, British Standard or Manley frames. It is not unusual to see some other sorts of hive (Smith, Commercial, WBC, Langstroth, and Rose). Dadant and Modified Dadant hives are widely used in France and Italy where their large size is an advantage. Square Dadant hives - often called 12 frame Dadant or Brother Adam hives - are used in large parts of Germany and other parts of Europe by commercial beekeepers. The Rose hive is a modern design that attempts to address many of the flaws and limitations of other <b>movable</b> <b>frame</b> hives. The only significant weakness of the Rose design is that it requires 2 or 3 boxes as a brood nest which infers a large number of frames to be worked when managing the bees. The major advantage shared by these designs is that additional brood and honey storage space can be added via boxes of frames added to the hive. This also simplifies honey collection since an entire box of honey can be removed instead of removing one frame at a time.|$|R

When the difference in the pendulum lengths is not too large, it is shown that the system settles down into the dynamic state of the antiphase synchronization with the phase difference π. We observe that there is a bistable region where either the antiphase synchronized state or the desynchronized state can be stabilized. We also find that there exists a hysteresis effect around the dynamic phase transition as the length difference is adiabatically changed. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

Various horizontal hives have been adapted and widely used for commercial migratory beekeeping. The Jackson Horizontal Hive is particularly well adapted for tropical agriculture. The De-Layens hive is popular in parts of Spain.|$|R

50|$|In 1814, Petro Prokopovych, {{the founder}} of {{commercial}} beekeeping in Ukraine, invented {{one of the very}} first beehive frames.

The correct distance between combs was described in 1845 by Jan Dzierżon as 1½ inches from the center of one top bar {{to the center of the}} next one. In 1848 Dzierzon introduced grooves into the hive's side walls replacing the strips of wood for moving top bars. The grooves were 8 x 8 mm, the spacing later termed bee space.

40|$|Steel moment {{resisting}} frames with post-tensioned (PT) connections use post-tensioned {{high strength}} strands running {{parallel to the}} beam to compress the beam flanges against the column flange.

The behavior and design of a PT connection and PT <b>frame</b> <b>system</b> is described, where a PT <b>frame</b> <b>system</b> is a PT frame interacting with the floor system.

40|$|Today, tall {{buildings}} are generally built {{with a central}} core that transfers the loads down to the ground. The central core takes up {{a large part of}} the floor space and there is less room for the actual purpose of the building, such as offices and apartments. The consequence of this is also less rental profit. At a certain height of the building, the central core will not alone manage to keep the building stable. Therefore it needs to be connected with outriggers to withstand the horizontal forces. The Tubed Mega <b>Frame</b> <b>system</b> developed by Tyréns is designed without the central core and the purpose is to transfer all the loads to the ground via the perimeter of building, making the structure more stable since the lever arm between the loads is maximized. The system has not yet been used in reality. This thesis aimed at testing the efficiency of the Tubed Mega <b>Frame</b> <b>system</b> against conventional systems for {{tall buildings}}. Two different types of the Tubed Mega <b>Frame</b> <b>system</b> were evaluated; TMF Perimeter frame and TMF Mega columns. To begin with, a pre-study was carried out with the purpose of comparing wind deflections and eigenmodes of several conventional systems and Tubed Mega <b>Frame</b> <b>systems.</b> The buildings were modeled in the finite element software ETABS. The Core, outrigger and perimeter <b>frame</b> <b>system</b> performed best compared to the other conventional systems and was therefore chosen as the conventional system to be tested in the main study. A comparison of the Core, outrigger and perimeter <b>frame</b> <b>system</b> and eight different configurations of Tubed Mega <b>Frame</b> <b>systems</b> was carried out for several different building heights as a main study, based on the tall building 432 Park Avenue, New York. The deformations due to wind and seismic loading and eigenmodes were compared. Furthermore, the models were controlled for tension at the base and Pdelta convergence. Overall the TMF Perimeter <b>frame</b> <b>systems</b> had the smallest deflections as the building height was increased and could be increased the most without reaching tension at the base. As the top story height of the buildings was increased, the Tubed Mega <b>Frame</b> <b>systems</b> outperformed the conventional system. For the TMF Perimeter <b>frame</b> <b>system</b> it could be seen that belt walls were more efficient than cross walls, and for the TMF Mega columns the smaller the distance between the belt or cross wall levels was, the less deflection was achieved. The Core, outrigger and perimeter <b>frame</b> <b>system</b> could be increased to 859 m in height before collapse and the Tubed Mega <b>Frame</b> <b>system</b> that performed best – TMF: Perimeter frame single story belt walls – was increased to 1024 m in height until divergence was achieved...|$|R
