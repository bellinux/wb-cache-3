40|$|A fit {{to purpose}} multi-analyte method for the {{official}} control of six coccidiostats (monensin sodium, salinomycin sodium, narasin, lasalocid sodium, semduramicin sodium and <b>maduramicin</b> <b>ammonium</b> alpha) at cross-contamination concentration levels in poultry, cattle, pig and calf compound feed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) {{has been developed}} and in-house validated. The corresponding maximum levels have been recently introduced by European legislation. The method developed involved a simple extraction of the coccidiostats from the feed samples followed by centrifugation and filtration of the supernatants for all matrices. For calf feed an additional de-fattening step of the filtrated supernatants with n-hexane was necessary. The resulting supernatants were submitted to chromatographic analysis. The analytes were quantified by a modified approach of the standard additions technique applied to the extracts, hence allowing a workload comparable to matrix-matched standard calibration curves. A further simplification of this technique was reached by applying the same addition levels of the target analytes for different concentration ranging from 0. 5 × maximum level up to 2. 5 × maximum level (universal approach). The concentration independent intermediate precision {{expressed in terms of}} relative standard deviation varied between 3 and 12 % (except for <b>maduramicin</b> <b>ammonium</b> alpha and semduramicin sodium up to 21 %) and the recovery rates ranged from 80 to 111 %, depending on the target analyte and matrix. The limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ) were different for the various analyte/matrix/instrument combinations but all LOQs were in the 0. 01 ¿ 0. 65 mgkg- 1 range, hence well below the target concentrations of each analyte. Based on the obtained method performance characteristics the method is considered fit for the intended purpose. JRC. DG. D. 6 -Food Safety and Qualit...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA multi-residue HPLC-ESI-MS/MS {{method has}} been {{developed}} for the simultaneous extraction, detection, and confirmation of the 11 coccidiostats concerned by Regulation 2009 / 8 /EC (lasalocid sodium, narasin, salinomycin sodium, monensin sodium, semduramicin sodium, <b>maduramicin</b> <b>ammonium</b> alpha, robenidine hydrochloride, decoquinate, halofuginone hydrobromide, nicarbazin, and diclazuril) in feedingstuffs at carry-over level. The sensitivity of the method allows quantification and confirmation for all coccidiostats below target concentration. The method was in-house validated and meets all criteria of European legislation (2002 / 657 /EC). The precision of the method was determined under repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility conditions; RSDr and RSDR were below the maximum permitted values for every tested concentration. The specificity was checked by analysing representative blank samples and blank samples fortified with potentially interfering substances (benzimidazoles, corticosteroides, triphenylmethane dyes, quinolones, nitrofurans, nitroimidazoles, phenicols) and no interference were found. Concerning quantification, a quadratic regression model was fitted to every calibration curve with a regression coefficient R 2 above 0. 99 on each data set. Finally, the expanded uncertainty U was calculated with data obtained within the laboratory while applying the method during validation and in routine tests...|$|E

Method validation included the determination of selectivity, linearity, specificity, repeatability, the limit of detection, limit of quantification, decision limit (CCα), detection capability (CCβ), and recovery. Feed samples from the Finnish national feed control programme and suspected carry-over samples from a feed manufacturer were analysed in parallel with an existing liquid chromatography method coupled with ultraviolet detection. All feed control samples were negative in LC-UV, but with the developed MS method, monensin, salinomycin, and narasin were detected at concentrations of < 0. 025 – 0. 73 [*]mg/kg, < 0. 025 – 0. 027 [*]mg/kg, and < 0. 025 – 1. 6 [*]mg/kg, respectively. In suspected carry-over samples after an output of 2. 0 tonnes of unmedicated feed in the pelletizer line, the concentrations of monensin, salinomycin, and narasin varied from undetected to 16 mg/kg. In the mixer line, after 3. 2 tonnes of unmedicated feed output, the concentrations of monensin, salinomycin, and narasin varied from undetected to 2. 4 [*]mg/kg...|$|E
