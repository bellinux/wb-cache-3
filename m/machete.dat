5|$|In 2010, Rodriguez {{wrote and}} co-directed a feature-length {{adaptation}} of his fake trailer, <b>Machete.</b> Many {{of the original}} actors from the trailer returned to their roles for it. <b>Machete</b> screened September 1 at the Venice Film Festival and was released across cinemas in the US on September 3, 2010.|$|E
5|$|<b>Machete</b> {{turned out}} to be more of a success at the box office than Grindhouse, {{grossing}} $44 million internationally against a just-over $10 million budget. At the end of the film, the announcer says that there would be two sequels: <b>Machete</b> Kills and <b>Machete</b> Kills Again. Soon afterward, Rodriguez confirmed that the financing for the sequels was in place, and that once everyone was free, they could begin shooting.|$|E

50|$|<b>Machetes</b> {{are often}} {{considered}} tools {{and used by}} adults. However, many hunter-gatherer societies and cultures surviving through subsistence agriculture begin teaching babies to use sharp tools, including <b>machetes,</b> before their first birthdays.|$|R
50|$|Toughness is {{important}} because of the twisting and impact forces that the relatively thin blade may encounter, while edge retention is secondary. Medium to high carbon spring steels, such as 1050 to 1095, are well suited to this application (with better <b>machetes</b> using the latter), and are relatively easy to sharpen. Most stainless steel <b>machetes</b> should be avoided, as many high-carbon stainless-steel <b>machetes</b> cannot stand up to repeated impacts, and will easily break if abused.|$|R
5|$|After {{the film}} was {{released}} on April 6, 2007, ticket sales performed significantly below box office analysts' expectations despite mostly positive critic reviews. In {{much of the rest}} of the world, each feature was released separately in extended versions. Two soundtracks were also released for the features and include music and audio snippets from the film. The feature later found more success on DVD and Blu-ray. In several interviews, despite the box office failure, the directors have expressed their interest in a possible sequel to the film due to its critical acclaim and successful home media sales. Three spin-off films were later made, based on Grindhouses fake trailers: <b>Machete,</b> <b>Machete</b> Kills and Hobo with a Shotgun.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists dug up the garden, while {{surveyors}} used infra-red beams {{to create}} a three-dimensional map of the area. A <b>machete</b> was found and sent for forensic tests. Police also searched the garden for Blakelock's truncheon and helmet. In October 2004 his overalls were retrieved from Scotland Yard's Crime Museum for DNA tests. Nothing was found {{that could be used}} as evidence.|$|E

It also features select bachata versions of songs by reggaetón and Latin pop artists including R.K.M & Ken-Y, Alejandro Fernández, Luis Fonsi, and Cristian Castro.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1950s, however, {{manufacturing}} shortcuts {{have resulted}} in a quality decline of <b>machetes.</b> Today, most modern factory-made <b>machetes</b> are of very simple construction, consisting of a blade and full-length tang punched from a single piece of flat steel plate of uniform thickness (and thus lack a primary grind), and a simple grip of two plates of wood or plastic bolted or riveted together around the tang. Finally, both sides are ground down to a rough edge so that the purchaser can sharpen the blade to their specific geometry using a file. These <b>machetes</b> are occasionally provided with a simple cord loop as a sort of lanyard, and a canvas scabbard - although in some regions where <b>machetes</b> are valuable, commonly used tools, the users may make decorative leather scabbards for them.|$|R
50|$|During {{the slavery}} era in Brazil, the {{slaves in the}} {{sugarcane}} plantations would gather and play Maculelê as a game to vent their anger and frustration from being slaves.

5|$|In the 2009 Friday the 13th reboot, young Jason (Caleb Guss) {{witnesses}} his mother's (Nana Visitor) beheading as a {{child and}} follows in her footsteps, killing anyone who comes to Crystal Lake. The adult Jason (Derek Mears) kidnaps Whitney Miller (Amanda Righetti), a girl who looks like his mother, and holds her prisoner in his underground tunnels. Months later, Whitney's brother Clay (Jared Padalecki) comes to Crystal Lake and rescues her. Eventually, Whitney uses Jason's devotion to his mother against him, stabbing him with his own <b>machete</b> while he is distracted when she appears.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} Friday the 13th (1980), Mrs. Pamela Voorhees (Betsy Palmer) stalks and murders the teenagers preparing Camp Crystal Lake for re‑opening. She {{is determined to}} ensure that the camp does not reopen after her son Jason (Ari Lehman) drowned in the lake due to the negligence of two staff members. The last counselor, Alice Hardy (Adrienne King), fends off Mrs. Voorhees long enough to grab a <b>machete</b> and decapitate her. In Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981), Jason (Steve Daskewisz/Warrington Gillette) is revealed to be alive and fully grown. After killing Alice Hardy, Jason returns to Crystal Lake to guard it from all intruders. Five years later, a group of teenagers arrive at Crystal Lake to set up a new camp, but Jason murders them. Ginny Field (Amy Steel), the last counselor Jason attempts to kill, finds a cabin in the woods with a shrine built around the severed head of Mrs. Voorhees. Ginny fights back and slams a <b>machete</b> through Jason's shoulder. Jason is left for dead as Ginny is taken away in an ambulance. During the events of Friday the 13th Part III (1982), Jason (Richard Brooker) removes the <b>machete</b> from his shoulder and finds his way to Chris Higgins' (Dana Kimmell) local homestead. Chris returns to her property with some friends, and Jason kills anyone who wanders into the barn where he is hiding. Taking a hockey mask from a victim to hide his face, Jason leaves the barn to kill the rest of the group. Chris seemingly kills Jason with an axe to his head, but the night's events drive her into hysteria as the police take her away.|$|E

5|$|Silcott {{was arrested}} for Blakelock's murder on 12 October 1985, six days after the riot; he was interviewed five times over 24 hours, Det Ch Supt Melvin asking the {{questions}} and Detective Inspector Maxwell Dingle taking the notes. During the first four interviews, he stayed mostly silent and refused to sign the detectives' notes, but during the fifth interview on 13 October, when Melvin said he knew Silcott had struck Blakelock with a <b>machete</b> or sword, his demeanour changed, according to the notes.|$|E
5|$|After he was arrested, Gonzalez gave {{permission}} for his vehicle, parked nearby, to be searched. Agents recovered 800 rounds of ammunition, two hatchets, and a <b>machete</b> from the car. Gonzalez {{was ordered to}} be held without bond until a detention hearing on October 1. Less than 24 hours later a 19-year-old man from New Jersey {{was arrested and charged}} with unlawful entry, after he initially tried to enter the White House on foot before returning in a vehicle, which he refused to exit at the checkpoint. There was no evidence to suggest the two incidents were related.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Edward William Purvis (July 4, 1857 – August 16, 1888) was a British {{army officer}} and settler of the Kingdom of Hawaii {{who served as}} Vice-Chamberlain {{during the reign of}} King Kalākaua. After resigning from the royal household, Purvis {{published}} two political satires aimed at undermining the image of the king and his prime minister, Walter M. Gibson, who had been responsible for the removal of Purvis' superior. These actions and other factors led to the demise of the Gibson regime and the Bayonet Constitution of 1887. Purvis died in the following year, after going to the United States to seek medical attention for his health. According to popular legend, he was an expert player of the Portuguese <b>machete</b> or cavaquinho and was believed to be the inspiration for the name of the Hawaiian ukulele.|$|E

5|$|Gibson directed, co-wrote and {{produced}} The Passion of the Christ in 2004, a Biblical epic drama which chronicled the Passion of Jesus. On its release, the film garnered mixed reviews {{as well as}} notoriety for its graphic violence and alleged undertones of antisemitism from critics. Nevertheless, it grossed $370.3 million in the United States and $611.4 million worldwide, making it Gibson's highest-grossing film to date. Two years later he directed, co-wrote {{and produced}} Apocalypto, an epic adventure set in Central America depicting {{the last days of}} Mayan civilization before Spanish arrival in the 16th century. Gibson then took a ten-year hiatus from directing during which time he landed roles in Edge of Darkness (2010), <b>Machete</b> Kills (2013), The Expendables 3 (2014), and Blood Father (2016). He directed Hacksaw Ridge in 2016, a biographical war drama focusing on American World War II veteran Desmond Doss, the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor.

5|$|In 2007, two {{driving under}} the {{influence}} incidents led to Lohan being put on probation, and together with three visits to rehabilitation facilities caused the loss of several movie deals. In 2008 and 2009, Lohan worked as a fashion model and launched the clothing line 6126. She resumed her acting career with TV work in 2008, and starred in the TV film Labor Pains (2009). She appeared in Robert Rodriguez's feature film <b>Machete</b> (2010). Between 2010 and 2013, Lohan went into rehabilitation three times, and spent much of her time entangled in legal problems stemming from misdemeanors and probation violations.
