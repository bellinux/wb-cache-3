30|$|The {{gestures}} {{are then}} divided into multiple states where each {{state has a}} primitive <b>motion</b> <b>element</b> given by {{the mean of the}} motion curve at each state. These primitive elements are synthesized from polynomial curves with the best fit in each state. The standard deviations due to variations between subjects at each state are also included in the primitive elements as shown in Fig.  3. Each of these states is recognized by the HMM detailed in the previous section and the corresponding primitive <b>motion</b> <b>element</b> is rendered in real time.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{a method}} for {{synthetic}} <b>motion</b> <b>element</b> synthesis for haptic rendering using hidden Markov models (HMM) is proposed. The proposed method {{was inspired by the}} embodied motion pattern generation for robots as detailed in [9, 10]. In the aforementioned work, the authors generated self-motion elements from recognized motion patterns in robots to replicate human motion patterns in robots. Here we use mimesis theory to recreate stable, real-time motion patterns for different gestures. The unstable motion patterns are fed to an HMM-based gesture recognition algorithm which recognizes the hidden states corresponding to an identified gesture. Primitive motion elements associated with each states are synthesized to recreate the ideal motion paths associated with each gesture. An algorithm for adaptive modulation of primitive <b>motion</b> <b>element</b> compared with changes in the real-time execution speed by users is also proposed. An objective analysis of the comparative performance of the synthesized motion data with the stable motion data obtained from a reference sensor is conducted to estimate the viability of the proposed model. Further, a subjective evaluation of vibrotactile feedback based on the proposed model was conducted to confirm the performance of the proposed methodology.|$|E

This virtual zoom radius is used as the <b>motion</b> <b>element</b> to control the haptic feedback. The z-axis data of each fingertip positions are neglected to obtain a planar circle approximation. Standard geometric equations shown in [27] we used in the calculation of zoom radius in real-time.|$|E

In addition, it suggested that both of <b>motion</b> <b>elements</b> have relationship as trade-off when the player can avoid a block while keeping fast ball speed. Both of <b>motion</b> <b>elements</b> need to be decreased to get fast ball speed. Also both of <b>motion</b> <b>elements</b> need to be increased to avoid a block...|$|R
30|$|The ideal motion {{curves and}} {{corresponding}} primitive <b>motion</b> <b>elements</b> to be synthesized for each gesture {{were obtained from}} multiple subjects in different conditions using a reference motion tracking sensor. An adaptive control algorithm was implemented to modulate the primitive <b>motion</b> <b>elements</b> based on the user’s actual gesture execution speed. Separate HMM models were trained for each gesture and motion patterns were synthesized in real time in spite of changes in speed and tracking irregularities. The shape and timing of the synthesized, measured, and moving average filtered motion data were compared with the reference motion curve obtained from a stable sensor. Moreover, user satisfaction levels for concurrent and terminal vibrotactile feedback based on different motion data were compared by a subjective evaluation using a questionnaire.|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} method allows multiplicity in {{the definition}} of haptic feedback signals. For e.g. a velocity curve based haptic rendering for dragging gesture can be achieved by applying a derivative of the dragging distance stored in the look-up table instead of the distance vector itself. Similar approaches can be extended to other gestures such as tapping, zooming etc also where velocity and acceleration curves can be obtained in real-time from the reference motion curves by applying derivates in real-time. Moreover, for applications requiring a specific velocity rendering curve, the recognition phase remains the same, but the reference motion curve and the corresponding the primitive <b>motion</b> <b>elements</b> stored in the look-up table only changes. This allows for easy modulation of the proposed approach with the changes {{in the definition}} of the haptic feedback controlling <b>motion</b> <b>elements</b> for each gesture.|$|R
40|$|Previous psychophysical {{studies have}} sought to {{determine}} whether the processes of movement engagement and termination are dissociable, whether stopping an action is a generic process, and whether there is a point in time in which the generation of a planned action is inevitable (“point of no return”). It is not clear yet, however, whether the action of stopping is merely a manifestation of low level, dynamic constraints, or whether it is also subject to a high level, kinematic plan. In the present study, stopping performance was studied while nine subjects, who generated free scribbling movements looking for the location of an invisible circular target, were requested unexpectedly to impede movement. Temporal analysis of the data shows that in 87 % of the movements subsequent to the ‘stop’ cue, the tangential motion velocity profile was not a decelerating function of the time but rather exhibited a complex pattern comprised of one or more velocity peaks, implying an unstoppable <b>motion</b> <b>element.</b> Furthermore, geometrical analysis shows that the figural properties of the path generated after the ‘stop’ cue were part of a repetitive geometrical pattern and that the probability of completing a pattern after the ‘stop’ cue was correlated with the relative advance in the geometrical plan rather than {{the amount of time that}} had elapsed from the pattern initiation. Altogether, these findings suggest that the “point of no return” phenomenon in humans may also reflect a high level kinematic plan and could serve as a new operative definition of motion primitives...|$|E
40|$|The term of preterm {{birth is}} used to define the {{premature}} neonates considering pregnancy age. In less than 34 week pregnancies, corticosteroids are prescribed to promote embryos’ lung maturity. The presents study aimed at evaluating effects of betamethasone injection on feeling embryo motion by mother and index and biophysical profile in preterm pregnancies. In a descriptive-analytical study, 40 pregnant women with the pregnancy age of 30 - 34 weeks were evaluated. Embryo motion and index and biophysical profile of the amniotic fluid were checked before prescription of double dosage of muscular betamethasone (12 mg) at a 24 h time interval. The injection was repeated for 24 and 48 h after the first injection. The resulted outcomes were compared with those results related to before betamethasone injection. In this study, there was statistically meaningful relationship between embryo motions before injection of betamethasone and 12 h after its injection (p = 0. 03). Also, {{there was a significant}} relationship between embryo motions 24 and 48 h after injection of betamethasone (p = 0. 001). In other words, the embryo motions decreased 12 h after injection of betamethasone. They were improved 48 h after betamethasone injection. But, index and biophysical profile results of amniotic fluid were left unchanged. Application of betamethasone leads to evident but transient decrease in embryo motions. Although <b>motion</b> <b>element</b> of index and biophysical profile of amniotic fluid {{which is one of the}} tests used in evaluating the embryo health is fixed and normal, it can be concluded that injection of betamethasone may not affect embryo health...|$|E
40|$|The overall aim of {{this current}} {{research}} was to investigate effects of individual differences and task demand on co-speech gestures in communication. Specifically, we examined whether gesture use affected speakers 2 ̆ 7 information content, and whether individual differences in working memory (WM) profiles and lexical retrieval, and task demand could account for variability in gesture use. Forty-four speaker-listener pairs of Mandarin-speaking adults participated in a video description task. The speaker watched and described motion event videos to the listener, who had two options to choose from. The speaker 2 ̆ 7 s descriptions were transcribed and coded for <b>motion</b> <b>element</b> type (manner, path, source, goal, and trajectory), modality use (speech vs. gesture), gesture type (deictic vs. iconic), gestures 2 ̆ 7 relation to speech (complementary vs. supplementary), and information type carried by gesture (spatial vs. semantic). A WM profile/discrepancy was measured by a difference between visuo-spatial and verbal working memory using Automated Working Memory Asessment (Alloway, 2007). Lexical retrieval was measured using a semantic fluency task (naming `animals 2 ̆ 7 or `foods 2 ̆ 7 in a one-minute interval). Task demand was manipulated by changing number of motion elements to be described in each video, ranging from two to four. The results of an ANOVA showed that speakers did not include more information when they chose to gesture, although they sometimes used supplementary gestures that carried information absent from speech. However, a series of mixed model regression analyses showed that spatial complementary gestures decreased with task demand, whereas spatial supplementary gestures increased with task demand. Also, Individual differences in WM discrepancy and spatial WM capacity, not lexical retrieval, predicted production of semantic supplementary gestures. The interaction between task demand and WM discrepancy predicted spatial complementary gestures. Also, the interaction between task demand and WM discrepancy predicted semantic supplementary gestures. Most importantly, we found that verbal dominant speakers produced fewer spatial complementary gestures when task demand was high, whereas spatial dominant speakers used these gestures similarly across task demands. Also, spatial dominant speakers tended to use more semantic supplementary gestures than verbal dominant speakers when task demand was low, but no such differences were found when task demand was high. Taken together, our findings reveal that individuals 2 ̆ 7 gesture production is a complex process, in which speaker-internal factors, such as WM, and speaker-external factors, such as task demand, and even interactions between the two factors could play a role. Given that communication is dynamic and complex, instead of restricting to one factor at a time, {{we may need to}} expand our scope to more influencing factors and their interactions to fully understand the underlying mechanism of multi-modal communication...|$|E

40|$|Ternus motion {{displays}} {{are well}} known to evoke two qualitatively different motion percepts. Group motion is typically reported for interstimulus intervals (ISIs) larger than a critical value of about 50 ms, while ISIs less than that produce the alternative percept of <b>element</b> <b>motion.</b> According to Braddick's two-process theory of <b>motion</b> processing, <b>element</b> <b>motion</b> occurs at brief and zero ISIs because low-level motion detectors signal the stationarity of the middle element(s). Breitmeyer and Ritter's account similarly points {{to the fact that}} the correspondence problem is trivially solved in favour of <b>element</b> <b>motion</b> at a zero ISI. Contrary to what one would expect based on these theories, we found that group motion can be evoked with a zero ISI: using multiple-frame stimuli moving in a single direction, group motion occurred even when the middle stimulus element(s) had no temporal gap. Additionally, we found that group <b>motion</b> turned into <b>element</b> <b>motion</b> again when we introduced an offset - onset asynchrony between the outer elements. A possible explanation for this finding is that only in this case the stimulus is compatible with the perceptual inference that all elements are moving at the same speed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSix {{observers}} {{were asked to}} indicate in which of two opposite directions, to the right or to the left, an entire display appeared to move, based on the proportion of right vs leftward <b>motion</b> <b>elements,</b> each of which was distinctly visible.

Although formally it was impossible to discriminate between these two models, treating observer as a counting device which measures a randomly selected subsample of all available <b>motion</b> <b>elements</b> had certain advantages. According to the Bernoulli trial model decisions about the global motion direction in a range of 12 – 800 elements were based on taking into account about 4 ± 2 random moving dot elements. This small number is not due to cancellation of the opposite motion vectors since the motion direction recognition performance did not improve after the compared motion directions were made orthogonal.
