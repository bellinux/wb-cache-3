25|$|According to her survivors, {{the first}} torpedo struck just aft {{of the bridge}} and caused major damage. Apparently, it {{exploded}} the ship's magazine; the resulting blast sheared off everything forward of the point of impact, destroying completely the bridge, the chart room, and the officers' and petty officers' quarters. As she stopped dead in the water, unable to signal a distress message, a second torpedo struck about 40 feet forward of the fantail and carried away the after part of the ship above the keel plates and shafts and destroyed the after crew's quarters. Only the <b>midships</b> <b>section</b> was left intact.|$|R

The <b>midship</b> <b>section</b> was duplicated for 56 feet fore and aftan original feature in steamboat designand the broad beam was considered an aid to stability. Like all large American wooden-hulled steamboats of the era, the hull was supported by heavy hog frames and iron tie-rods suspended from king posts to prevent excessive hogging, but in Commonwealths case it was also strengthened with diagonal iron braces [...] "after the manner of fastening the first-class sea-going steamships", and constructed throughout [...] "with great reference to strength and safety." ...|$|E

It displays {{the ratio of}} the immersed volume of the hull to a volume of a prism with equal length to the ship and cross-sectional area equal to the largest underwater section of the hull (<b>midship</b> <b>section).</b> This is used to evaluate the distribution of the volume of the underbody. A low or fine Cp indicates a full mid-section and fine ends, a high or full Cp indicates a boat with fuller ends. Planing hulls and other highspeed hulls tend towards a higher Cp. Efficient displacement hulls travelling at a low Froude number will tend to have a low Cp.|$|E

2500|$|Cipriano Andrade, Jr., {{engineer}} and yacht designer, said of Spray: “After a thorough analysis of Sprays lines, I found {{her to have}} a theoretically perfect balance. Her balance is marvelous — almost uncanny. Try as I would — one element after another — they all swung into the same identical line. I attacked her with proportional dividers, planimeter, rotameter, Simpson's rule, Froude's coefficients, Dixon Kemp's formulae, series, curves, differentials, and all the appliances of modern yacht designing, and she emerged from the ordeal a theoretically perfect boat. For when she is underway every element of resistance, stability, weight, heeling effort, and propulsive force is in one transverse plane, and that plane is the boat's <b>midship</b> <b>section.</b> I know of no similar case in the whole field of naval architecture, ancient or modern.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The design {{evolved from}} earlier straight-stemmed, long-keel boats into a beamy shallow hull with a {{pronounced}} reverse {{curve in the}} <b>midship</b> <b>section</b> and a cut away forefoot. The square tuck stern changed into an immersed elliptical counter, either by evolution or adoption of the Southport form, the change being complete before 1880. All of the boats had wide side decks and a long cockpit, {{about a third of}} the beam in width, with low freeboard and a low rail to facilitate lifting the gear on board. These shrimp boats, about , were fast and handy in the shallow waters of Morecambe Bay. The larger boats were called “prawners”, though they were actually used to catch pink shrimps (Pandalus montagui). In addition to the larger prawner (called [...] "sprawner" [...] at Morecambe) a subtype called [...] "bay boat" [...] developed for the holiday trade. The bay boat had a shallow draft so it could operate around Grange-over-Sands at the head of Morecambe Bay.|$|E

Just over two hours out of port, a violent explosion lifted Sturtevants stern from the water, but caused no apparent damage. Thinking herself under submarine attack, the destroyer dropped two depth charge barrages. About a minute after she dropped the second barrage of charges, a second detonation rocked the ship. She began to settle rapidly, but on an even keel. Minutes later, a third explosion ripped her keel apart beneath the after deckhouse. The <b>midships</b> <b>section</b> sank immediately, and the stern settled soon thereafter. The bow, curiously, remained above water for several hours. Finally, however, all but the crow's nest disappeared beneath the waves. Sturtevant went down off Key West about 8 mi north of the Marquesas Keys. Fifteen of her crew were lost with the ship.|$|R
5000|$|On 3 December, while {{operating}} near Bermuda, {{the ship}} lost all power {{due to an}} engineering failure. The ship had no power to any equipment except those powered by batteries.

In the midst of six-foot swells, there began heavy movement between the two ships causing frequent contact, buckling several frames in the <b>midships</b> <b>section,</b> and causing considerable superficial damage to the starboard side. After temporary repairs were made, all lines were cleared, and W. S. Sims returned to home port for repairs.

5000|$|While her {{forepart}} planted {{firmly on}} the shelving shore her stern was floating in 30 feet of water.
