In this review, we explore the areas where <b>molecular</b> <b>pharming</b> can make the greatest impact, including the production of pharmaceuticals that have novel glycan structures or that cannot be produced efficiently in microbes or mammalian cells because they are insoluble or toxic. We also explore the market dynamics that encourage the use of <b>molecular</b> <b>pharming,</b> particularly for pharmaceuticals that are required in small amounts (such as personalized medicines) or large amounts (on a multi-ton scale, such as blood products and microbicides) and those that are needed in response to emergency situations (pandemics and bioterrorism). The impact of <b>molecular</b> <b>pharming</b> will increase as the platforms become standardized and optimized through adoption of good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards for clinical development, offering a new opportunity to produce inexpensive medicines in regional markets that are typically excluded under current business models...|$|E
40|$|An {{economic}} and cheap production of {{large amounts of}} recombinant allergenic proteins might become a prerequisite for the common use of microarray-based diagnostic allergy assays which allow a component-specific diagnosis. A <b>molecular</b> <b>pharming</b> strategy was applied to express the major allergen of Artemisia vulgaris pollen, Art v 1, in tobacco plants and tobacco cell cultures. The original Art v 1 with its endogenous signal peptide which directs Art v 1 to the secretory pathway, was expressed in transiently transformed tobacco leaves but was lost in stable transformed tobacco plants during the alternation of generations. Using a light-regulated promoter and “hiding” the recombinant Art v 1 in the ER succeeded in expression of Art v 1 over three generations of tobacco plants and in cell cultures generated from stable transformed plants. However, the amounts of the recombinant allergen were sufficient for analysis but not high enough to allow an economic production. Although <b>molecular</b> <b>pharming</b> {{has been shown to}} work well for the production of non-plant therapeutic proteins, it might be less efficient for closely related plant proteins...|$|E

The current shortages in protein therapeutics due to the capacity and economic bottlenecks faced with modern protein production platforms (microbial, yeast, mammalian) has driven considerable attention towards <b>molecular</b> <b>pharming.</b> Utilizing plants for the large-scale production of recombinant proteins {{is estimated to be}} 2 – 10 % the cost of microbial platforms, and up to 1, 000 -fold more cost effective than mammalian platforms (Twyman et al.

Plastid transformation is becoming more popular and an alternative to nuclear gene transformation because of various advantages like high protein levels, the feasibility of expressing multiple proteins from polycistronic mRNAs, and gene containment through the lack of pollen transmission. Recently, much progress in plastid engineering has been made. In addition to model plant tobacco, many transplastomic crop plants have been generated which possess higher resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and <b>molecular</b> <b>pharming.</b> In this mini review, we will discuss {{the features of the}} plastid DNA and advantages of plastid transformation.

40|$|The {{development}} of new alternative platforms for subunit vaccine production is a priority in the biomedical field. In this study, Ustilago maydis, the causal agent of common corn smut or ‘huitlacoche’has been genetically engineered to assess expression and immunogenicity of the B subunit of the cholera toxin (CTB), a relevant immunomodulatory agent in vaccinol-ogy. An oligomeric CTB recombinant protein was expressed in corn smut galls at levels of up to 1. 3 mg g- 1 dry weight (0. 8 % of the total soluble protein). Mice orally immunized with ‘huitlacoche’-derived CTB showed significant humoral responses that were well-correlated with protection against challenge with the cholera toxin (CT). These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using edible corn smut as a safe, effective, and low-cost platform for pro-duction and delivery of a subunit oral vaccine.

40|$|Plant toxins are {{substances}} {{produced and}} secreted by plants {{to defend themselves}} against predators. In a broad sense, this includes all substances that have a toxic effect on targeted organisms, whether they are microbes, other plants, insects, or higher animals. Plant toxins have a diverse range of structures, from small organic molecules through to proteins. This review gives {{an overview of the}} various classes of plant toxins but focuses on an interesting class of protein-based plant toxins containing a cystine knot motif. This structural motif confers exceptional stability on proteins containing it and is associated {{with a wide range of}} biological activities. The biological activities and structural stability offer many potential applications in the pharmaceutical and agricultural fields. One particularly exciting prospect is in the use of protein-based plant toxins as molecular scaffolds for displaying pharmaceutically important bioactivities.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the stable {{expression of a}} medically important antibody in the staple cereal crops rice and wheat. We successfully expressed a single-chain Fv antibody (ScFvT 84. 66) against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a well characterized tumor-associated marker antigen. scFv constructs were engineered for recombinant antibody targeting to the plant cell apoplast and ER. Up to 30 mg/g of functional recombinant antibody was detected in the leaves and seeds of wheat and rice. We confirmed that transgenic dry seeds could be stored {{for at least five}} months at room temperature, without significant loss of the amount or activity of scFvT 84. 66. Our results represent the first transition from model plant expression systems, such as tobacco and Arabidopsis, to widely cultivated cereal crops, such as rice and wheat, for expression of an antibody molecule that has already shown efficacy in clinical applications. Thus, we have established that <b>molecular</b> <b>pharming</b> in cereals can be a viable production system for such high-value pharmaceutical macromolecules.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of significant levels of transgenic products in plant cells is required {{not only for}} crop improvement, but also for <b>molecular</b> <b>pharming.</b> However, knowledge {{about the fate of}} transgenic products and endogenous proteins in grain cells is lacking. Here, we utilized a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach for comparative analysis of expression profiles of transgenic rice endosperm cells in response to expression of a recombinant pharmaceutical protein, human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulation factor (hGM-CSF). This study provided the first available evidence concerning the fate of exogenous and endogenous proteins in grain cells. Among 1883 identified proteins with a false positive rate of 5 %, 103 displayed significant changes (p-value < 0. 05) between the transgenic and the wild-type endosperm cells. Notably, endogenous storage proteins and most carbohydrate metabolism-related proteins were down-regulated, while 26 S proteasome-related proteins and chaperones were up-regulated in the transgenic rice endosperm. Furthermore, it was observed that expression of hGM-CSF induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and activated the ubiquitin/ 26 S-proteasome pathway, which led to ubiquitination of this foreign gene product in the transgenic rice endosperm...|$|E
40|$|There is {{interest}} in establishing genetic modification technologies for the cultivated mushroom Agari-cus bisporits, both for improved crop characteristics and for <b>molecular</b> <b>pharming.</b> For these methods to be successful, {{it is necessary}} to establish a set of transformation systems that include robust and reliable vectors for gene manipulation. In this article, we report the evaluation of a series of promoters for driving expression of the Escherichia coli hph gene encoding hygromycin phosphotransferase. This was achieved using the Aspergillus nidulans gpdA and the A. bisporus gpdII and trp 2 promoters. The Coprinus cinereils beta-tubulin promoter gave contrasting results {{depending on the size of}} promoter used, with a 393 -bp region being effective, whereas the longer 453 -bp fragment failed to yield any hygromycin-resistant transformants. The C. cinereus trp 1 and the A. bisportis lcc 1 promoters both failed to yield transformants. We also show that transformation efficiency may be improved by careful selection of both appropriate Agrobacterium strains, with AGL- 1 yielding more than LBA 1126 and by the choice of the binary vectors used to mobilize the DNA, with pCAMBIA vectors appearing to be more efficient than either pBIN 19 - or pGREEN-based systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of using tissue-specific promoters in the genetic transformation of plants has been emphasized increasingly. Here, we report {{the isolation of}} a novel seed-specific promoter region from peanut and its validation in Arabidopsis and tobacco seeds. The reported promoter region referred to as groundnut seed promoter (GSP) confers seed-specific expression in heterologous systems, which include putative promoter regions of the peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) gene 8 A 4 R 19 G 1. This region was isolated, sequenced, and characterized using gel shift assays. Tobacco transgenics obtained using binary vectors carrying uidA reporter gene driven by GSP and/or cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoters were confirmed through polymerase chain reaction (PCR), RT-PCR, and computational analysis of motifs which revealed the presence of TATA, CAAT boxes, and ATG signals. This seed-specific promoter region successfully targeted the reporter uidA gene to seed tissues in both Arabidopsis and tobacco model systems, where its expression was confirmed by histochemical analysis of the transgenic seeds.

However, the enhancement of heterologous protein production and the expression of multi-target genes remains a challenge. In this study, heterologous protein expression in the enoki mushroom Flammulina velutipes was notably enhanced using 2 A peptide-mediated cleavage to co-express multiple copies of single gene. The polycistronic expression vectors were constructed by connecting multi copies of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) gene using 2 A peptides derived from porcine teschovirus- 1. The P 2 A peptides properly self-cleaved {{as shown by the}} formation of the transformants with antibiotic resistant capacity and exciting green fluorescence levels after introducing the vectors into F. velutipes mycelia. The results of western blot analysis, epifluorescent microscopy and EGFP production showed that heterologous protein expression in F. velutipes using the polycistronic strategy increased proportionally as the gene copy number increased from one to three copies. In contrast, much lower EGFP levels were detected in the F. velutipes transformants harboring four copies of the egfp gene due to mRNA instability. The polycistronic strategy using 2 A peptide-mediated cleavage developed in this study can not only be used to express single gene in multiple copies, but also to express multiple genes in a single reading frame.

40|$|To {{develop a}} new {{strategy}} to target recombinant proteins to the vacuolar storage system in transgenic plants, {{the ability of the}} transmembrane and cytosolic domains of Arabidopsis receptor homology-transmembrane-RING H 2 - 1 (AtRMR 1) was evaluated. A secreted version of RFP (secRFP) and a fusion of it to the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of AtRMR 1 (RFP-TMCT) were produced and studied both in transient and stable expression assays. Transient expression in leaves of Nicotiana tabacum showed that secRFP is secreted to the apoplast while its fusion to TMCT of AtRMR 1 is sufficient to prevent secretion of the reporter. In tobacco leaves, RFP-TMCT reporter showed an endoplasmic reticulum pattern in early expression stages while in late expression stages, it was found in the vacuolar lumen. For the first time, the role of TM and CT domains of AtRMR 1 in stable expression in Arabidopsis thaliana is presented; the fusion of TMCT to secRFP is sufficient to sort RFP to the lumen of the central vacuoles in leaves and roots and to the lumen of PSV in cotyledons of mature embryos. In addition, biochemical studies performed in extract from transgenic plants showed that RFP-TMCT is an integral membrane protein. Full-length RFP-TMCT was also found in the vacuolar lumen, suggesting internalization into destination vacuole. Not colocalization of RFP-TMCT with tonoplast and plasma membrane markers were observed. This membrane vacuolar determinant sorting signal could be used for future application in <b>molecular</b> <b>pharming</b> as an alternative means to sort proteins of interest to vacuoles...|$|E

This report describes the stable expression of functionally different two types of recombinant proteins in the staple cereal crop rice. In the first experiment, {{with the aim of}} engineering functionally active jelly fig pectin methylesterase (PME) in a well-established expression system, a cDNA fragment encoding PME from jelly fig achene has been introduced in rice plants {{under the control of the}} glutelin promoter. Rice plants obtained from the transformed lines inherited the transgene which specifically expressed in rice endosperm. This successful functional expression of this acidic jelly fig PME in rice has significantly broadened its applications in industry. In the second experiment, with a view to upgrade rice protein quality, multiple copies of sesame Prepro 2 S have been introduced in rice plants under the control of seed-specific glutelin promoter. Rice plants obtained from the transformed lines inherited the transgene which specifically expressed in rice endosperm. Transgenic rice eventually will play a major role in the nutrition of human being especially for the vegetarians.

40|$|Compared {{to other}} {{expression}} platforms, plants present several advantages for {{the expression of}} recombinant antibodies such as the ability to assemble multimers, the possibility to achieve posttranslational modifications similar to those found in mammalian cells, low management costs and ease of scalability. Despite these advantages, some drawbacks need to be addressed. One of the limits of the plant expression systems, is represented by downstream purification steps, in which many factors, such as low antibody concentration, extraction methodologies and purification strategy, could influence the effectiveness of the purification. Another important issue to be addressed in the use of plants for antibody expression, is represented by plant glycosylation. The considerable differences between the sugar moieties harbored by proteins expressed in plants and mammals, represents a major drawback in the application of the plant-derived immunoglobulins in human therapy since the possible immunogenicity of these sugar moieties. An additional drawback of recombinant antibodies obtained from plants is represented by the final recovery yield, that can be, in some cases, reduced by the unintended proteolytic process taking place in the plant cell machinery. Particularly, in the case of antibody expression, as reported in many studies, degradation could produce a protein reduction of about 90 % of the final purified product. In this work, we described the expression of the human recombinant antitumoral antibody H 10 in Nicotiana benthamiana using a transient expression system based on vacuum agroinfiltration, focusing our research efforts on the above mentioned issues: extraction and purification strategies, glycosylation profile and proteolysis. The first part of the work emphasized that the application of different extraction methodologies was able to significantly affect the integrity and yield of the IgG H 10 antibody purified from agroinfiltrated N. benthamiana leaves. Based on the data collected, we optimized a pilot-scale purification method, using a two-step purification protocol from 250 g of fresh agroinfiltrated leaves obtaining an average yield of 40 mg per Kg fresh weight of intact IgG with 99. 4 % purity, with endotoxin levels < 1 EU/ml, free of phenolic, alkaloid compounds. In the second part, the glycosylation pattern of plant produced H 10 was modulated using three different strategies in order to study the effect of the different glycosylation profiles on antibody quality and plant expression yield. Finally, the proteolysis of the plant-derived IgG H 10 was studied in order to analyze in planta antibody degradation profile and to identify specific cleavage sites of the immunoglobulin. Furthermore, an in silico analysis permitted the identification of proteases responsible of the cleavage. Data herein represent valid a contribution in the field of plant-made antibodies, and intend to provide new information in the <b>molecular</b> <b>pharming</b> area. Our research efforts aimed to confirm the possibility to over-express immunoglobulins with a “human like” glycosylation profile in N. benthamiana plants, reducing the unintended plant proteolysis to increase the final yield of intact IgG.
