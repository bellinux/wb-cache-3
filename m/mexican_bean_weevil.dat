At the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), Colombia, scientists have been looking at new ways of transferring important traits that occur in wild forms of Phaseolus vulgaris in to domestic varieties of the bean. The two major pests of stored dried beans in Africa and Latin America are the <b>Mexican</b> <b>bean</b> <b>weevil</b> (Zabrotes subfasciatus) and the bean weevil (Acanthoscelides obtectus). By screening thousands of accessions of wild P. vulgaris, CIAT entomologists identified some that were resistant to <b>Mexican</b> <b>bean</b> <b>weevil,</b> others resistant to bean weevil, and two that were resistant to both insects. Among Mexican bean weevils that died in resistant seed, studies conducted in cooperation with the University of Wisconsin pointed to a single cause of death: the protein arcelin, which the insect apparently cannot digest well. (Tie protein's name is based on the town of Arcelia in Mexico where wild bean accessions containing this gene were collected.) Since the biosynthesis of arcelin in resistant genotypes is a simply inherited trait, researchers were able to breed resistance to Z. subfasciatus into experimental lines of domesticated beans. These lines are now being tested in Africa and Latin America.

The new variant is clearly distinct from previously reported ones. It confers high levels of resistance to MBW, comparable to those due to the presence of arcelin 1, arcelin 2 and arcelin 4. Accessions containing arcelin 7 were not as resistant as the one containing arcelin 5 but significantly better in terms of resistance than arcelins 3 and 6.

The proteinase inhibitor Pj was purified using Sephacryl S- 200 gel filtration followed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a Vidac 18 TP. Inhibitor Pj showed a Mr of 20, 000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a Mr of 19. 2 K by mass spectrometry. The inhibition of papain by the Pj inhibitor was the noncompetitive type, with a Ki value of 0. 59 3 1029 M. The gelatinase activity of papain was strongly inhibited by Pj too. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the Pj inhibitor showed homology with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the Kunitzproteinase inhibitor family.

40|$|Digestive a-amylases play an {{essential}} role in insect carbohydrate metabolism. These enzymes belong to an endo-type group. They catalyse starch hydrolysis, and are involved in energy production. Larvae of Zabrotes subfasciatus, the <b>Mexican</b> <b>bean</b> <b>weevil,</b> are able to infest stored common beans Phaseolus vulgaris, causing severe crop losses in Latin America and Africa. Their a-amylase (ZSA) is a well-studied but not completely understood enzyme, having specific characteristics when compared to other insect a-amylases. This report provides more knowledge about its chemical nature, including a description of its optimum pH (6. 0 to 7. 0) and temperature (20. 30 °C). Furthermore, ion effects on ZSA activity were also determined, showing that three divalent ions (Mn 2 +, Ca 2 +, and Ba 2 +) were able to enhance starch hydrolysis. Fe 2 + appeared to decrease a- amylase activity by half. ZSA kinetic parameters were also determined and compared to other insect a-amylases.

This has not only resulted in an enhanced resource for humans, {{but also for the}} insects that feed on these seeds. Seed beetles that attack wild and cultivated seeds often lay several eggs on a single seed. We hypothesized that the larger seed size of domesticated beans will mitigate the competition among the larvae that hatch from these eggs, with important implications for their growth and survival. To test this we examined how seed size of wild and cultivated Phaseolus lunatus (lima bean) affect the performance of the <b>Mexican</b> <b>bean</b> <b>weevil</b> Zabrotes subfasciatus, an important pest of beans in Mexico. A negative correlation was found between the initial number of eggs on a seed and the weight of female beetles that emerged, but only for the much smaller wild seeds. Similarly, beetle survival was found to be negatively correlated with competition intensity only on wild seeds. Our results imply that by selecting for larger seeds, domestication of P. lunatus has reduced the intensity of intraspecific larval competition of Z. subfasciatus...|$|E

We characterized the interaction of alpha AI- 1 present in {{seeds of the}} common bean, of a different isoform, alpha AI- 2, present in seeds of wild common bean accessions, and of two homologs, alpha AI-Pa present in seeds of the tepary bean (Phaseolus acutifolius) and alpha AI-Pc in seeds of the scarlet runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus), with the midgut extracts of several bruchids. The extract of the Z. subfasciatus larvae rapidly digests and inactivates alpha AI- 1 and alpha AI-Pc, but not alpha AI- 2 or alpha AI-Pa. The digestion {{is caused by a}} serine protease. A single proteolytic cleavage in the beta subunit of alpha AI- 1 occurs at the active site of the protein. When degradation is prevented, alpha AI- 1 and alpha AI-Pc do not inhibit the alpha-amylase of Z. subfasciatus, although they are effective against the alpha-amylase of C. chinensis. Alpha AI- 2 and alpha AI-Pa, on the other hand, do inhibit the alpha-amylase of Z. subfasciatus, suggesting that they are good candidates for genetic engineering to achieve resistance to Z. subfasciatus...|$|E

Arcelin {{is a member of}} the arcelin-phytohemagglutinin-?-amylase inhibitor (APA) family of seed proteins, which has been extensively studied but not widely used in bean breeding programs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate microsatellite markers for genetic analysis of arcelin-based bruchid resistance and to determine the orientation of markers and the rate of recombination around the APA locus. A total of 10 previously developed microsatellites and 22 newly developed markers based on a sequenced BAC from the APA locus were screened for polymorphism and of these 15 were mapped with an F 2 population of 157 individuals resulting from a susceptible × resistant cross of SEQ 1006 × RAZ 106 that segregated for both the arcelin 1 allele and resistance to the bruchid, Z. subfasciatus. Microsatellites derived from APA gene sequences were linked within 0. 8 cM of each other and were placed relative to the rest of the b 04 linkage group. In a comparison of genetic to physical distance on the BAC sequence, recombination was found to be moderate with a ratio of 125 kb/cM, but repressed within the APA locus itself. Several markers were predicted to be very effective for genetic studies or marker-assisted selection, based on their significant associations with bruchid resistance and on low adult insect emergence and positions flanking the arcelin and phytohemagglutinin genes.

Plant traits such as chemical defenses after damage can affect not only the performance of the insect herbivores that feed on the plants but also the availability of them to their predators / parasitoids. The aim of my Phd thesis was in one side, to test whether in each specific community herbivores and their natural enemies will have adapted to the plant defenses induced by earlier herbivores. We tested that by determining the extent to which damage on leaves and seeds of Lima bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus) by the leaf beetle (Cerotoma ruficornis) and the bean pod weevil (Apion godmani) affects the performance and choice behavior of the <b>Mexican</b> <b>bean</b> <b>weevil</b> (Zabrotes subfasciatus) which arrive later in the season. In parallel we also studied how such effects affected the next trophic level (parasitoids). In the other side, we showed that in Lima bean there is a potential conflict between attracting defending ants and pollinators. This conflict could only be detected in situations of an increased production of extrafloral and floral nectar by plants induced with JA. By integrating the results regarding both direct and indirect defenses in Lima bean we can conclude that the complexity of the plant responses is driven by hormonal control.

40|$|In {{common bean}} (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), the most {{abundant}} seed proteins are the storage protein phaseolin and the family of closely related APA proteins (arcelin, phytohemagglutinin and α-amylase inhibitor). High variation in APA protein composition has been described {{and the presence of}} arcelin (Arc) has been associated with bean resistance against two bruchid beetles, the bean weevil (Acanthoscelides obtectus Say) and the <b>Mexican</b> <b>bean</b> <b>weevil</b> (Zabrotes subfasciatus Bohemian). So far, seven Arc variants have been identified, all in wild accessions, however, only those containing Arc- 4 were reported to be resistant to both species. Although many efforts have been made, a successful breeding of this genetic trait into cultivated genotypes has not yet been achieved. Here, we describe a newly collected wild accession (named QUES) and demonstrate its resistance to both A. obtectus and Z. subfasciatus. Immunological and proteomic analyses of QUES seed protein composition indicated the presence of new Arc and arcelin-like (ARL) polypeptides of about 30 and 27 kDa, respectively. Sequencing of cDNAs coding for QUES APA proteins confirmed that this accession contains new APA variants, here referred to as Arc- 8 and ARL- 8. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis showed the two proteins are closely related to APA components present in the G 12949 wild bean accession, which contains the Arc- 4 variant. The presence of these new APA components, combined with the observations that they are poorly digested and remain very abundant in A. obtectus feces, so-called frass, suggest that the QUES APA locus is involved in the bruchid resistance. Moreover, molecular analysis indicated a lower complexity of the locus compared to that of G 12949, suggesting that QUES should be considered a valuable source of resistance for further breeding purposes...|$|E
40|$|Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean) is an {{important}} source of protein for human and animal consumption. Economic losses post-harvest in storage are primarily due to the bruchid beetles Acanthoscelides obtectus (Bean Weevil) and Zabrotes subfasciatus (<b>Mexican</b> <b>Bean</b> <b>Weevil).</b> Wild-lines exhibiting resistance to these two species have been found and the mechanisms of resistance to each species are investigated. The mechanisms of resistance to the two species are found to be multiple, and different for each species. In the case of Z. subfasciatus, the presence of a novel storage protein and absence of the conventional storage protein constitutes the primary mechanism. The novel protein ("arcelin") is antimetabolic when included in artificial diets. In vitro digestibility studies indicate that it is indigestible to Z. subfasciatus larval gut proteases, and since arcelin constitutes the major protein of the seed the larvae starve. Arcelin has a similar amino- acid sequence to PHA. Also present is WBAI, a highly specific inhibitor of larval amylase of the two bruchid pests Z. subfasciatus and Callosobruchus maculatus, whilst having virtually no inhibitory activity on the mammalian amylase, nor on other insect, bacterial nor fungal enzymes. WBAI is similar in gross structure to the conventional amylase inhibitor obtainable from RKB (commercial P. vulgaris), and both are also immunologically similar to PHA. Both of these mechanisms are suitable for incorporation into commercial seed, and the former has already been tested, using meal from seeds, in feeding trials using rats, confirming absence of mammalian toxicity. Resistance to A. obtectus damage is accompanied by reduced starch content, and high content of an acidic polysaccharide (whose structure has not been elucidated). No protein cause for resistance was found. Inheritance of resistance to A. obtectus is recessive. Since the factor responsible for resistance is not a primary gene product and is expressed recessively, this factor is unsuitable for incorporation into breeding lines to be used for developing commercial cultivars...|$|E
