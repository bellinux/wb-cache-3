30|$|OCT {{measurements}} were obtained using the Stratus OCT 3 (software ver. 5.0), a time-domain OCT instrument (Carl Zeiss, Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA). Scanning was performed using the fast macular thickness map protocol, consisting of six evenly spaced 6 -mm radial lines for quantitative measurements; each line consisted of 128 A-scans, intersecting at the fovea, {{for a total}} of 768 sampled points with a scanning time of 1.9  s. Central 1 -mm subfield thickness (Area A 1) was recorded using the manufacturer’s imaging software. In instances when automated central macular thickness could not be computed due to marked thickening, the caliper mode on the Stratus OCT was used for a <b>manual</b> <b>center</b> point thickness measurement. High-resolution vertical and horizontal cross-hair patterns (9 – 3  o’clock and 6 – 12  o’clock) were also obtained for assessment of evidence of overlying macular edema (cystoid versus diffuse), retinal pigment epithelium scar, and foveal atrophy.|$|E

50|$|Word processors, by contrast, center text {{based on}} a {{computer}} algorithm using a fixed central reference point rather than the left margin on the typewriter as measured from the paper's edge.

50|$|The United States Air Force re-leased the {{established}} facility in 1951 and assigned it to Air Defense Command (ADC).

40|$|Precise {{machining}} {{of bearing}} rings {{is integral to}} finished bearing assembly quality. The output accuracy of center-based machining systems such as lathes or magnetic chuck grinders relates directly {{to the accuracy of}} part centering before machining. Traditional tooling and methods for centering on such machines are subject to wear, dimensional inaccuracy, setup time (hard tooling) and human error (<b>manual</b> <b>centering).</b> A flexible system for initial part centering is developed based on a single measurement system and actuator, whereby the part is placed by hand onto the machine table, rotated and measured to identify center of geometry offset from center of rotation, then moved by a series of controlled impacts or pushes to align the centers. The prototype centering system is developed as a demonstration platform for research in a number of mechanical engineering areas, particularly: Characterization of optimal state estimators through analysis of accuracy and computational efficiency; Distributed communication and control, efficient transfer of information in a real-time environment, and information sharing between processes; Modeling of sliding dynamics and the interaction of friction with compliant body dynamic models; Motion path planning through both deterministic geometric transforms and through frequency domain command manipulation. A vision is created for future work not only in the described areas, but also in the areas of advanced controller design incorporating multiple variables, derived machine diagnostic information, and application of the distributed communication architecture to information flow throughout the manufacturing organization. The guiding motivation for this research is reduction of manufacturing processing costs in the face of global competition. The technologies researched, developments made, and directions prescribed for future research aid in enabling this goal. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Dr. Thomas R.

5000|$|The SAGE radar {{stations}} of Air Defense Command (Aerospace Defense Command after 1968) were the military installations operated by USAF squadrons using the 1st automated air defense environment (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) and networked by the SAGE System, a computer network. Most of the radar stations used the Burroughs AN/FST-2 Coordinate Data Transmitting Set (CDTS) to automate the operator environment and provide radar tracks to sector command posts at SAGE Direction Centers (DCs), e.g., the Malmstrom Z-124 radar station was co-located with DC-20. The sector/division radar stations were networked by DCs and <b>Manual</b> Control <b>Centers</b> to provide command, control, and coordination (e.g., at Topsham AFS for the [...] "Bangor North American Air Defense Sector") for ground-controlled interception of enemy aircraft by interceptors {{such as the}} F-106 developed {{to work with the}} SAGE System.|$|R
