Since there was quite plausibly {{such a thing as}} natural nonbelief in early humans, then it doesn't make <b>much</b> <b>sense</b> to say that said nonbelief is self-deceptive. That's because natural nonbelief entails nonresistant nonbelief.|$|E
25|$|As a {{military}} term, the word quijote refers to cuisses, {{part of a}} full suit of plate armour protecting the thighs. The Spanish suffix -ote denotes the augmentative—for example, grande means large, but grandote means extra large.

25|$|Although {{the first}} {{electric}} railway between Retiro and Tigre was inaugurated in 1916, major electrification projects were not adopted.

After several decades of the Buenos Aires rail-service being under-funded, there is presently an ongoing modernistion plan so as to provide much needed improvement in services, and the trend is towards electrification of several lines. Similarly, ongoing maintenance and investment has continued on existing electric lines, such as with the $845 million purchase of 705 CSR electric multiple unit cars from China for the Mitre, Sarmiento and Roca lines in 2013.|$|E

25|$|There is {{controversy}} in the academic world though as to who is really {{the topic of the}} machinations of the Gallo-Romano Aristocracy after the death of Avitus who was of Gallic origin and from amongst their own ranks. Many scholars old and new have either read the name of the event Marcellini, Marcelliniana instead of Marcellana. This does not make <b>much</b> <b>sense</b> to place Marcellinus as the person in question for this action of the Gallic aristocracy since he is not Gallic and most likely comes from a wealthy Dalmatian family. The assumption to place Marcellinus as the person being spoken of has only led others to assume then that he is Gallic in origin when there is absolutely no evidence to support this. Mathisen has shown that Marcellinus cannot be the person in question and that Apollinaris Sidonius was speaking of a Marcellus, who was a Gallic aristocrat. He demonstrates why Marcellinus cannot logically be the person in question by comparing other names written by the same author and showing that Sidonius using the same style in writing the names thus giving the support it is Marcellus not Marcellinus he speaks of.|$|E
500|$|The {{amendment}} {{removed the}} stigma of not being considered purebred from American-bred horses. A major consideration was that by the late 1940s most of the horses with suspect pedigrees were so far back in most horses' ancestry {{that it no longer}} made <b>much</b> <b>sense</b> to exclude them. Neither did it make <b>much</b> <b>sense</b> to exclude some of the most successful racehorses in Europe from registration. Weatherby's further amended its regulations in 1969, introducing the word [...] "thoroughbred" [...] to describe the horses registered in previous volumes of the General Stud Book.

Crooke's introduction to Tod's 1920 edition of the Annals recorded that the old Indian texts recorded [...] "the facts, not as they really occurred, but as the writer and his contemporaries supposed that they occurred." [...] Crooke also says that Tod's [...] "knowledge of ethnology was imperfect, and he was unable to reject the local chronicles of the Rajputs." [...] More recently, Robin Donkin, a historian and geographer, has argued that, with one exception, [...] "there are no native literary works with a developed sense of chronology, or indeed <b>much</b> <b>sense</b> of place, before the thirteenth century", and that researchers must rely on the accounts of travellers from outside the country.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{the track}} {{was met with}} mixed reviews from music critics.

Hitfire praised the refrain and the strophes of the tune, but criticized its drop and main part, confessing that they [...] "destroy the song a little bit".

Daring To Do provided a negative review for [...] "I Did It, Mama!", {{saying that it was}} [...] "boring" [...] and confessing that its radio potential was [...] "below zero".

500|$|Later that year, Farrell {{played the}} main {{antagonist}} in the Fright Night remake, joining Anton Yelchin, David Tennant and Toni Collette {{in the story}} of a charismatic vampire who moves next door to a high-school student and his single mother. The film was released by DreamWorks, with Craig Gillespie (of Lars and the Real Girl) directing a script by Buffy the Vampire Slayer writer Marti Noxon. Sukhdev Sandhu of the Telegraph wrote that Farrell [...] "proves his comedy credentials once more....utterly seductive as the plushly eyebrowed carpenter-cum-bloodsucker", while the New York Timess A.O.

500|$|Series creator Eric Kripke had {{previously}} {{written for the}} WB series Tarzan, and was offered the chance to pitch show ideas to the network. He used the opportunity for Supernatural, a concept he had been developing for nearly ten years. Kripke envisioned Supernatural as a road trip series, deeming it the [...] "best vehicle to tell these stories because it's pure, stripped down and uniquely American... These stories exist in these small towns all across the country, and it just makes so <b>much</b> <b>sense</b> to drive {{in and out of}} these stories." [...] Though the network rejected his initial pitch—a tabloid reporter investigates supernatural occurrences throughout the country—they were still interested in a series featuring urban legends. Kripke quickly suggested a Route 66-style series, and the network loved it. Filming was greenlit after director David Nutter, who previously had worked with Kripke on Tarzan, signed on.|$|E

Robert Bianco for USA Today wrote of Chenoweth's guest appearance: [...] "Her presence {{may not make}} <b>much</b> <b>sense,</b> but that's probably all right. If it means hearing Chenoweth sing, we can put up with any explanation the show cares to offer." [...] Raymund Flandez for The Wall Street Journal was equally positive regarding Chenoweth's role, praising her [...] "powerful voice", [...] "kittenish mien" [...] and [...] "commanding presence". Flandez deemed the performance of [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] the show's best number since [...] "Don't Stop Believin debuted in the pilot episode. Mike Hale of the New York Times similarly stated that [...] "The Rhodes Not Taken" [...] was [...] "the best episode musically since the pilot", calling the performance of [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] "truly rousing".

500|$|The mildly complex {{reciprocal}} skill {{system was}} generally praised, {{with a few}} exceptions. IGN, though finding the manual's {{description of the system}} unclear, found the classes well balanced and well designed for all play styles. GameSpot found the system clear and sensible. PC Gamer, by contrast, found the system unbalanced, with combat privileged over other features. Computer Gaming World felt the system's privileging of combinations of single-handed combat weapons and shields over double-handed weapons unnecessarily exploitable, but appreciated the freedom offered by the broad skillset and action-dependent leveling. GameSpy gave strong commendation to the system, stating that [...] "The advancement system makes so <b>much</b> <b>sense</b> that it makes other games, even games set in the D world such as Baldur's Gate, look silly by comparison". Morrowinds combat system was poorly received by the gaming press. GameSpot characterized it as one of the game's major weak points and GameSpy devoted the majority of their review's minor complaints to it. The system was disparaged for its simplicity and for its tendency to bore.|$|E

500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was {{critical}} of Emma in the show's second season. He said: [...] "Emma is apparently married, but we haven’t seen her husband since October, and {{even when he was}} more of a “fixture” on the show (which is difficult to say about a character who’s appeared as little as Carl Howell has), his relationship with Emma made no sense as anything other than a plot device. Now, as it turns out, Emma and Carl haven’t consummated their marriage at all, and this {{has something to do with}} the fact that the show has combined Emma’s germ-phobia and virginity into some sort of terrifying psychosexual pathology that doesn’t make <b>much</b> <b>sense</b> and doesn’t resemble the somewhat levelheaded person she used to be. (The plotting in Will Schuester’s love life is the one place where the show attempts to have even a modicum of continuity, for whatever reason.) Anyway, Carl is necessarily upset about this, and he’s also upset when Holly Holliday gets Emma to admit that she still has confusing feelings for Will, so he resolves to let her stay in the condo while he stays in the Radisson where all of the good big-name Glee guest stars go to hope their pilots for the fall are picked up." ...|$|E
500|$|Not all of {{the recent}} {{critical}} reaction to Tenebrae has been positive. Geoff Andrew of Time Out thought that the film was [...] "unpleasant even by contemporary horror standards". John Kenneth Muir, author of Horror Films of the 1980s, considers the film to be far inferior to Suspiria, but acknowledges {{that it was so}} [...] "unremittingly gory" [...] that it justified its US title of [...] "Unsane". John Wiley Martin, although evaluating the film as a [...] "technically mesmeric" [...] one, felt that thematically it was a [...] "disappointingly retrograde step" [...] for Argento. Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com called it a [...] "gory but not particularly effective Argento horror flick", while Dennis Schwartz of Ozus' World Movie Reviews dismissed it as [...] "trash", giving it the grade C. Gary Johnson, editor of Images, complained, [...] "Not much of Tenebre makes <b>much</b> <b>sense.</b> The plot becomes little more than an excuse for Argento to stage the murder sequences. And {{these are some of the}} bloodiest murders of Argento's career." [...] In 2004, Tim Lucas re-evaluated the film and found that some of his earlier enthusiasm had dimmed considerably, noting that, [...] "Tenebre is beginning to suffer from the cheap 16 mm-like softness of Luciano Tovoli's cinematography, its sometimes over-storyboarded violence (the first two murders in particular look stilted), the many bewildering lapses in logic... and the overdone performances of many of its female actors".|$|E
