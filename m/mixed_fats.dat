40|$|P OPULATIONS habitually {{subsisting}} on diets low in fats tend to {{have low}} concentra-tions of cholesterol in the blood serum. ‘- Because isocaloric substitution of carbohy-drates for the <b>mixed</b> <b>fats</b> in the ordinary American diet decreases the serum cholesterol level of man in experiments, {{it seems reasonable to}} attribute the findings in these populations to their low dietary fat intake. However, many populations who subsist on low-fat diets are also low in their consumption of total protein or of proteins of animal origin, so the question arises as to whether the dietary protein is in-fluential in producing the low cholesterol values. The present paper is a report of controlled experiments on human subjects on diets con-stant in calories but differing in protein content. In one experiment the serum cholesterol re-sponse to a change from a moderate-fat diet to a high-fat diet was compared at two levels of protein intake (about 83 and 130 g daily). In another pair of experiments two groups of men were maintained on a diet constant in fats (64 to 69 g daily), the protein intake was then doubled for four weeks and subsequently was reduced to the original protein level. In these latter experiments a daily supplement of 1000 mg of cholesterol was also added to the diet, with and without the protein supplement, for eight weeks. Skimmed milk powder was used as the source of the protein supplement...|$|E

40|$|International audienceChronic {{fish oil}} {{intervention}} had {{been shown to}} {{have a positive impact on}} endothelial function. Although high fat meals have often been associated with a loss of postprandial vascular reactivity, studies examining the effects of fish oil fatty acids on vascular function in the postprandial phase are limited. Our aim was to examine the impact of the addition of fish oil fatty acids to a standard test meal on postprandial vascular reactivity. Twenty-five men received in random order either a placebo oil meal (40 g of <b>mixed</b> <b>fat,</b> fatty acid profile representative of the UK diet) or a fish oil meal (31 g <b>mixed</b> <b>fat</b> and 9 g fish oil) on 2 occasions. Vascular reactivity was measured at baseline (0 h) and 4 h after the meal by laser Doppler iontophoresis and blood samples taken for the measurement of plasma lipids, total nitrite, glucose and insulin. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase mRNA gene expression was determined in endothelial cells after incubation with triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) isolated from the 4 h plasma samples. Compared with baseline, sodium nitroprusside (endothelial independent vasodilator) induced reactivity (P= 0. 024) and plasma nitrite levels (P= 0. 001) were increased after the fish oil meal. In endothelial cells, postprandial TRLs isolated after the fish oil meal increased eNOS and decreased NADPH oxidase gene expression compared with placebo oil meal TRLs (P≤ 0. 03). In conclusion, meal fatty acids appear to be an important determinant of vascular reactivity, with fish oils significantly improving postprandial endothelial independent vasodilation...|$|R

40|$|Model fat blends were {{prepared}} by blending of synthesized structural triglycerides with Canola oil. Structural triglycerides differed by molecular weight {{and location of}} acyls in the molecules of sn- 1, 2 -diacyl- 3 -stearoylglycerol, sn- 1, 3 -diacyl- 2 -stearoylglycerol, and sn- 1 -kaprinoyl- 2 -stearoyl- 3 -lauroylglycerol. These structural triglycerides are similar by their composition to structures that {{are present in the}} mixture obtained by transesterification of coconut (palm kernel) oil and fully hydrogenated oil (Canola, soybean). Transesterification is used recently to obtain structural trans-isomers free fats for production of margarine fat blends. Basic physical properties (melting point, solidification point, solid fat content, and yield value) were measured in the model fat blends. Molecular weight and symmetry of structural triglycerides influence greatly the physical properties of model fat blends. Model fat blends with the symmetrical structural triglyceride showed higher values of the measured physical properties in comparison to the ones with corresponding unsymmetrical structural triglyceride. <b>Mixed</b> model <b>fat</b> blends that contained symmetrical and unsymmetrical structural triglyceride with the same fatty acids acyls {{were prepared}} as well. It was determined that physical properties of the <b>mixed</b> <b>fat</b> blends generally do not have additive character of model fat blends concentration.
