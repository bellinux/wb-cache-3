This was evidenced by the final minutes in the episode, setting things up for a new arc based on Frozen in the fourth season.|$|E

25|$|Gardner {{argues that}} there is a wide range of {{cognitive}} abilities, but that there are only very weak correlations among them. For example, the theory postulates that a child who learns to multiply easily is not necessarily more intelligent than a child who has more difficulty on this task. The child who takes more time to master multiplication may best learn to multiply through a different approach, may excel in a field outside mathematics, or <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> at and understanding the multiplication process at a fundamentally deeper level.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Laliberté {{bought out}} Gauthier, and with 95% ownership, has {{continued}} to expand the brand. In 2008, Laliberté split 20% of his share equally between two investment groups Istithmar World and Nakheel of Dubai, {{in order to further}} finance the company's goals. In partnership with these two groups, Cirque du Soleil had planned to build a residency show in the United Arab Emirates in 2012 directed by Guy Caron (Dralion) and Michael Curry. But since Dubai's financial problems in 2010 caused by the 2008 recession, it was stated by Laliberté that the project has been [...] "put on ice" [...] for the time being and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> for another financial partner to bankroll the company's future plans, even willing to give up another 10% of his share. Several more shows are in development around the world, along with a television deal, women's clothing line and the possible venture into other mediums such as spas, restaurants and nightclubs. Cirque du Soleil also produces a small number of private and corporate events each year (past clients have been the royal family of Dubai and the 2007 Super Bowl).|$|E

500|$|Critics {{were divided}} with the {{character}} development and the storylines in Tron: Legacy. Writing for The New Yorker, Bruce Jones commented that the audience didn't connect {{with the character}}s, as they were lacking emotion and substance. [...] "Disney <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> for a merchandising bonanza with this long-gestating sequel to the groundbreaking 1982 film," [...] remarked Jones, [...] "but someone in the corporate offices forgot to add any human interest to its action-heavy script." [...] Likewise, USA Today journalist Claudia Puig found Tron: Legacy to resonate with [...] "nonsensical" [...] and [...] "unimaginative, even obfuscating" [...] dialogue, and that [...] "most of the story just doesn't scan". As Dana Stevens from Slate summed up, [...] "Tron: Legacy {{is the kind of}} sensory-onslaught blockbuster that tends to put me to sleep, the way babies will nap to block out overwhelming stimuli. I confess I may have snoozed through one or two climactic battles only to be startled awake by an incoming neon Frisbee." [...] Although he proclaimed the plot of Tron: Legacy and its predecessor to be spotty, Ian Buckwater of NPR was lenient of the latter film due to its youth-friendly nature. In contrast to negative responses, Michelle Alexander of Eclipse adored the plot of Tron: Legacy, a reaction that was paralleled by Rossiter Drake from 7x7, who wrote that it was [...] "buoyed" [...] by its [...] "sometimes convoluted, yet hard to resist" [...] story. Metros Larushka Ivan-Zadeh complained about the underdeveloped plot, saying [...] "In 2010, issues surrounding the immersive nature of gaming and all-consuming power of modern technology are more pertinent than ever, so it's frustrating the script does nothing with them." [...] However, she conceded that [...] "it's the best 3D flick since Avatar and a super-groovy soundtrack by Daft Punk nonetheless makes for an awesome watch".|$|E

2500|$|As of October 24, 2015, nearly 60 {{women have}} claimed that they were sexually abused by Cosby, and the terms [...] "sociopath" [...] and [...] "serial rapist" [...] {{have been used to}} {{describe}} him. Jewell Allison, one of his accusers, described him as a [...] "sociopath" [...] and stated: [...] "We <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> at America's greatest serial rapist that ever got away with this for the longest amount of time.

2500|$|Photographers find perp walks {{their second}} most-dreaded {{assignment}} after {{going to the}} home of someone who has recently died to ask for a picture. They must wait a long time for a period of a few seconds in which they will be competing with a potentially large group of other photographers and television crews. This presents the possibility that they can be trampled beneath the group, as depicted in the 1994 film The Paper, and the difficulty of photographing a defendant who <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> downward to keep his face from view. Marty Lederhandler, an Associated Press photographer who worked for {{the last half of the}} 20th century and shot the perp walks of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, as well as David Berkowitz, describes the perp walk as [...] "it's, 'He'll be out in 10 minutes.' You line up. He comes out and into the car, and you've got your picture. Nice." [...] When he began in the years after World War II, Lederhandler says, the media was more polite during perp walks than they are now. [...] "We all had the same lenses those days, and everybody would stand 8 or 10 feet back, and nobody was pushing or shoving." ...|$|E
