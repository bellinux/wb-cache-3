40|$|PURPOSE: This note {{expands the}} scope and utility of the Waterways Experiment Station (WES) plant {{bioassay}} procedure by using Cyperus escu[entus (yellow nut-sedge) as an index plant to link an existing agronomic data base {{to that of the}} WES data base. Relating contaminant uptake and mobility by the index plant grown on dredged material to that of an existing agricultural data base may show that levels of contaminant uptake by plants and subsequent mobility into the food web from dredged material may be compared to what is normally acceptable in agricultural products. Therefore, contaminant uptake and mobil-ity may not be as harmful to the environment as often projected (i. e., absence of “unacceptable adverse effect”). This technical note is a synopsis of a contract report prepared under the Toxic Substances Bioaccumulation by Plants work unit in the Long-Term Effects of Dredging Operations Program. Dr. Brian E.

Due in part to the effectiveness of the Children Challenging Industry (CCI)programme some educationalists now contend that laboratory based school science teaching needs to be complemented by out‐of‐school science learning that draws on the actual world (e.g. through field trips to industry etc.), the presented world (e.g. in science centres, botanic gardens, zoos and science museums), and the virtual worlds that are increasingly available through information technologies.|$|R
