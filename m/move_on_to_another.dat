25|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the draft, the Dolphins began {{contract}} negotiations with Jake Long. On April 14, Peter King of Sports Illustrated reported that the Dolphins had given Long a deadline to accept their contract offer (believed to be worth less than 2007 No. 1 pick JaMarcus Russell received from the Oakland Raiders); otherwise, they would <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> prospect. On April 22, the Dolphins officially signed Long to a five-year, $57.75 million contract with $30 million guaranteed, assuring they would take him first overall. On May 19, the Dolphins signed sixth-rounders Jalen Parmele and Lex Hilliard and seventh-rounder Lionel Dotson to contacts. On May 23, sixth-round pick Donald Thomas was signed to a multi-year deal. On July 11, the Dolphins signed third-round pick Kendall Langford to a multi-year deal.|$|E
500|$|The actual {{killing method}} varies {{according}} to prey species. With large prey, mature wolves usually avoid attacking frontally, instead focusing on the rear and sides of the animal. Large prey, such as moose, is killed by biting large chunks of flesh from the soft perineum area, causing massive blood loss. Such bites can cause wounds [...] in length, with three such bites to the perineum usually being sufficient to bring down a large deer in optimum health. With medium-sized prey such as roe deer or sheep, wolves kill by biting the throat, severing nerve tracks and the carotid artery, thus causing the animal to die within {{a few seconds to}} a minute. With small, mouse-like prey, wolves leap in a high arc and immobilize it with their forepaws. When prey is vulnerable and abundant, wolves may occasionally surplus kill. Such instances are common in domestic animals, but rare in the wild. In the wild, surplus killing primarily occurs during late winter or spring, when snow is unusually deep (thus impeding the movements of prey) or during the denning period, when wolves require a ready supply of meat when denbound. Medium-sized prey are especially vulnerable to surplus killing, as the swift throat-biting method by which they are killed allows wolves to quickly kill one animal and <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Two {{days after}} Knight {{was fired from}} Indiana University, Jeremy Schaap of ESPN interviewed him and {{discussed}} his time at Indiana. Towards {{the end of the}} interview, Knight talked about his son, Pat, who had also been dismissed by the university, wanting an opportunity to be a head coach. Schaap, thinking that Knight was finished, attempted to <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> subject, but Knight insisted on continuing about his son. Schaap repeatedly tried to ask another question when Knight shifted the conversation to Schaap's style of interviewing, notably chastising him about interruptions. Knight then commented (referring to Schaap's father, Dick Schaap), [...] "You've {{got a long way to}} go to be as good as your dad!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Mulligan {{dropped out}} of high school during his senior year to pursue work with a touring band. He {{contacted}} bandleader Tommy Tucker when Tucker was visiting Philadelphia's Earle Theatre. While Tucker did not need an additional reedman, he was looking for an arranger and Mulligan was hired at $100 a week to do two or three arrangements a week (including all copying). At the conclusion of Mulligan's three-month contract, Tucker told Mulligan that he should <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> band that was a little less [...] "tame". Mulligan went back to Philadelphia and began writing for Elliot Lawrence, a pianist and composer who had taken over for Warrington as the band leader at WCAU.|$|E
2500|$|Sexual {{activity}} of kangaroos consists of consort pairs. Oestrous females roam widely and {{attract the attention}} of males with conspicuous signals. A male will monitor a female and follow her every movement. He sniffs her urine to see if she is in oestrus, a process exhibiting the flehmen response. The male will then proceed to approach her slowly to avoid alarming her. [...] If the female does not run away, the male will continue by licking, pawing, and scratching her, and copulation will follow. After copulation is over, the male will <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> female. Consort pairing may take several days and the copulation is also long. Thus, a consort pair is likely to {{attract the attention of}} a rival male. As larger males are tending bonds with females near oestrus, smaller males will tend to females that are farther from oestrus. Dominant males can avoid having to sort through females to determine their reproductive status by searching for tending bonds held by the largest male they can displace without a fight.|$|E
2500|$|Peter, a stereotypical blue-collar worker, {{frequently}} gets {{drunk with}} his neighbors Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire at [...] "The Drunken Clam," [...] Quahog's local tavern. After taking an I.Q. test, Peter discovered his low intellect falls slightly {{below the level}} for mental retardation. Peter {{is known for his}} brash impulsiveness, which has led to several awkward situations, such as attempting to molest Meg in order to adopt a redneck lifestyle. He is incredibly jealous of other attractions Lois has in her life, an attitude which has led to extreme situations, such as when he assaulted a whale that kissed Lois at SeaWorld. In the third season episode [...] "Stuck Together, Torn Apart", Peter and Lois split up because of Peter's jealousy, only to discover that Lois has the same character flaw and the two decide to live with their mutually jealous nature. Peter has a very short attention span which frequently leads him to bizarre situations, as Chris points out in [...] "Long John Peter", after Peter's parrot dies [...] "He will get over it pretty quickly and then <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> wacky thing", to which Peter finds a pipe organ and forgets about his parrot (Peter then destroys the pipe organ within seconds and then finds a deed to a cattle ranch).

2500|$|On December 7, UN {{officials}} {{claimed that}} the $7.1 billion budget (USD) for peacekeeping troops was insufficient even before planned reinforcements of MONUC could be fulfilled; even the troop and equipment requirements may not be met, as Western countries declined support, citing the conflict not as [...] "strategically vital" [...] as those in Iraq and Afghanistan. International Crisis Group vice-president Fabienne Hara stated that, [...] "Contributions of U.N. members states will probably not grow at the very least, if not diminish... may not be funded properly due to a crisis in terms of resources." [...] An anonymous UN official {{claimed that the}} Security Council could [...] "drop the ball, <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> issue and we're the ones at fault. We've seen before that {{is a recipe for}} failure." [...] Reuters reported that a senior Western Security Council diplomat claimed that, while criticism was not invalid, other countries with reserves of troops should aid failing peacekeeping missions. The official stated that [...] "We're not the only ones who can do this. Where are the Russians, the Ukrainians? Where are the developing countries who want to have seats on the Security Council? Where is Brazil? It doesn't always have to be us." [...] The lack of peacekeeping resources was cited as counterproductive by political analyst Max Bergmann of the National Security Network. [...] "UN forces ... do fail, but this is often the result of either too few troops or too little money. Our reliance on the United Nations to address trouble spots and to prevent them from worsening has only increased. Shorting the U.N. on peacekeeping funding is therefore akin to shooting ourselves in the foot." [...] European Union nations declined to intervene.|$|E
2500|$|St. Elsewheres series finale {{featured}} momentous {{changes for}} several main characters, including the departures of Drs. Fiscus and Morrison {{and the death}} of Dr. Auschlander, as well as the return of Dr. Westphall to an active leadership role at St. Eligius after Ecumena agrees to sell the hospital back to the Boston archdiocese, as Dr. Gideon is set to <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> hospital in San Jose, California. [...] The finale is more known for its provocative final scene: Westphall and his son Tommy Westphall (played by Chad Allen), who has autism, are seen in Dr. Auschlander's office watching snow falling outside. The image cuts to an exterior shot of the hospital. At that moment, Tommy and Daniel Auschlander are seen in an apartment building, with Tommy playing with a snow globe. Donald arrives home from a day of work, and {{it is clear from the}} uniform he wears and the dialog in this scene that he works in construction. [...] "Auschlander" [...] is revealed to be Donald's father, and thus Tommy's grandfather. Donald laments to his father, [...] "I don't understand this autism thing, Pop. Here's my son. I talk to him. I don't even know if he can hear me, because he sits there, all day long, in his own world, staring at that toy. What's he thinking about?" [...] As Tommy shakes the snow globe, he is told by his father to come and wash his hands for dinner. Donald places the snow globe on the family's television set and walks into the kitchen with Tommy and Auschlander; as they leave the room, the camera closes in on the snow globe—which holds a replica of St. Eligius.|$|E
