5|$|Seafood has {{traditionally}} been important to the cuisine of Jersey: <b>mussels</b> (called moules in the island), oysters, lobster and crabs – especially spider crabs – ormers and conger.|$|E
5|$|There are 28 {{species and}} {{subspecies}} of threatened freshwater <b>mussels</b> in Michigan. Of these, 9 are species of special concern, 6 {{are listed as}} threatened and 13 are endangered. Six are also federally listed as endangered.|$|E
5000|$|Mussels: Interpretation {{of archaeological}} <b>mussel</b> shell is {{complicated}} {{because it is}} reliant {{on the condition of}} the <b>mussel</b> beds, distance to the <b>mussel</b> beds and the type of harvest method being employed. In general, however, sites closer to <b>mussel</b> beds should have larger <b>mussel</b> shell due to plucking and residential consumption. Sites far from <b>mussel</b> procurement beds would be expected to have a mix of <b>mussel</b> shell sizes due to stripping. The presence of higher amounts of small <b>mussel</b> shell could also indicate and increase in resource intensification.|$|R
40|$|The green <b>mussel</b> Perna viridis forms a {{significant}} fishery along the Malabar coast. The green <b>mussel</b> forms extensive beds on the laterite and granite formations along Kasargod to Kozhikode in the intertidal and subtidal zones up to 15 - 20 m depth. The <b>mussel</b> farming sector now faces twofold problem in acquiring seed for farming in the estuaries. a) <b>Mussel</b> spat settlement {{has been relatively}} poor and not available duringthe <b>mussel</b> farming season. b) The <b>mussel</b> pickers are unwilling to supply seed to the <b>mussel</b> farmers...|$|R
50|$|Similar species {{include the}} European <b>mussel,</b> Mytilus galloprovincialis, {{and the black}} <b>mussel,</b> Choromytilus meridionalis. The European <b>mussel</b> is similar in shape and color to the brown <b>mussel</b> and shares its native habitat on the {{south-western}} coast of Africa. The European <b>mussel</b> is also more resistant to human disturbance such as use for baits and consumption. It is out-competing the brown <b>mussel</b> as it is more resistant to certain parasites. The black <b>mussel</b> has similar shape and size although it lacks the distinguishable pitted resillal ridge.|$|R
5|$|There were no {{permanent}} indigenous settlements on Point Loma {{because of a}} lack of fresh water. Kumeyaay people did visit Ocean Beach periodically to harvest <b>mussels,</b> clams, abalone and lobsters.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{have been}} an {{important}} source of food for humans at least since Roman times and empty shells found in middens at archaeological sites are evidence of earlier consumption. Oysters, scallops, clams, ark clams, <b>mussels</b> and cockles are the most commonly consumed kinds of bivalve, and are eaten cooked or raw. In 1950, the year in which the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) started making such information available, world trade in bivalve molluscs was 1,007,419 tons. By 2010, world trade in bivalves had risen to 14,616,172 tons, up from 10,293,607 tons a decade earlier. The figures included 5,554,348 (3,152,826) tons of clams, cockles and ark shells, 1,901,314 (1,568,417) tons of <b>mussels,</b> 4,592,529 (3,858,911) tons of oysters and 2,567,981 (1,713,453) tons of scallops. China increased its consumption 400-fold during the period 1970 to 1997.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to promoting growth of kelp forests, sea otters {{can also have}} a profound effect in rocky areas that tend to be dominated by mussel beds. They remove <b>mussels</b> from rocks, liberating space for competitive species and thereby increasing the diversity of species in the area.|$|E
5000|$|The Asian Green <b>Mussel</b> (Perna viridis) cuisines are favored in Thalassery dishes. The <b>mussel</b> {{is called}} Kallu-mma-kaya (fruit on the stone). They grow on rocks {{in contact with}} sea. Other dishes include Kallummakaya porichathu (fried <b>mussel),</b> Arikkadukka (Stuffed-in-shell <b>mussel,</b> steamed and fried [...] ), <b>mussel</b> pickels. Elambakka (clams) are also popular. The green <b>mussel's</b> {{popularity}} led farmers to employ aquaculture in local rivers to increase supplies. Thalassery natives {{are known for their}} generous hospitality towards guests.|$|R
50|$|Choromytilus chorus, {{common name}} Chorus <b>Mussel</b> or Choro <b>mussel,</b> is {{a species of}} <b>mussel,</b> a marine bivalve mollusc in the family Mytilidae.|$|R

5|$|The {{ability of}} sea <b>mussels</b> to {{maintain}} their grip on rocks in the ocean is facilitated by their use of organometallic iron-based bonds in their protein-rich cuticles. Based on synthetic replicas, the presence of iron in these structures increased elastic modulus 770 times, tensile strength 58 times, and toughness 92 times. The amount of stress required to permanently damage them increased 76 times.|$|E
5|$|Varieties of meat {{consumed}} include poulet (chicken), pigeon (squab), canard (duck), oie (goose, {{the source}} of foie gras), bœuf (beef), veau (veal), porc (pork), agneau (lamb), mouton (mutton), caille (quail), cheval (horse), grenouille (frog), and escargot (snails). Commonly consumed fish and seafood include cod, canned sardines, fresh sardines, canned tuna, fresh tuna, salmon, trout, <b>mussels,</b> herring, oysters, shrimp and calamari.|$|E
5|$|California spiny {{lobsters}} are nocturnal, hiding in crevices during the day, {{with only the}} tips of their long antennae showing, {{as a means of}} avoiding predators. Towards dawn, the {{spiny lobsters}} form aggregations, which they maintain until dusk. At night, they emerge and feed on sea urchins, clams, <b>mussels</b> and worms. This activity is important in limiting sea urchin populations, and so maintaining healthy seabed communities.|$|E
5000|$|The Chilean <b>mussel</b> or Chilean blue <b>mussel</b> {{is a type}} of blue <b>mussel</b> {{native to}} the coasts of Chile and the Falkland Islands.

50|$|The study {{compared}} the golden <b>mussel</b> with the zebra <b>mussel</b> (Dreissena polymorpha) {{which is another}} aggressive invasive species. The golden <b>mussel</b> is more tolerant of increased salinity, low pH values and higher temperatures than the zebra <b>mussel.</b> The study considered the likely effect if the golden <b>mussel</b> were to reach North America. It seemed likely {{that it would be}} able to colonise water masses that did not suit the zebra <b>mussel,</b> and thus would devastate native unionids in their few remaining strongholds.|$|R
50|$|Mytilopsis leucophaeata is {{a species}} of small bivalve mollusc in the false <b>mussel</b> family, Dreissenidae. It is {{commonly}} known as Conrad's false <b>mussel</b> or the Dark false <b>mussel.</b>|$|R
5|$|Copper is biostatic, meaning {{bacteria}} {{and many other}} forms of life will not grow on it. For this reason {{it has long been}} used to line parts of ships to protect against barnacles and <b>mussels.</b> It was originally used pure, but has since been superseded by Muntz metal and copper-based paint. Similarly, as discussed in copper alloys in aquaculture, copper alloys have become important netting materials in the aquaculture industry because they are antimicrobial and prevent biofouling, even in extreme conditions and have strong structural and corrosion-resistant properties in marine environments.|$|E
5|$|Exotic {{species of}} fauna {{such as the}} zebra and quagga <b>mussels</b> and the New Zealand mud snail are {{invasive}} species that can greatly impact fish species. Though the mussel species are not known to be in Wyoming, several surrounding regions have reported them. The New Zealand mud snail {{has been found in}} the Shoshone River east of the forest. Forest managers have established a preventative program to try to keep these species from entering forest waterways.|$|E
5|$|Like most brown algae, Postelsia {{goes through}} {{alternation}} of generations, {{and is an}} annual species. The diploid sporophyte produces, through meiosis, haploid spores, which drip down through the grooves in the blades onto the substrate, which may be <b>mussels,</b> barnacles, or bare rock. These spores develop, through mitosis, into small, multicellular haploid gametophytes, male and female. The male and female gametophytes create sperm and eggs, respectively. The sperm of the male reaches the female egg and fertilizes, resulting in a diploid zygote, which develops into a new sporophyte.|$|E
50|$|The {{deepwater}} snail Bathynerita naticoidea {{can detect}} <b>mussel</b> beds containing the <b>mussel</b> Bathymodiolus childressi, {{because it is}} attracted to water that has cues in it from this species of <b>mussel.</b>|$|R

40|$|In 2014, a {{non-indigenous}} dreissenid bivalve, the quagga <b>mussel</b> (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis Andrusov, 1897) was for {{the first}} time recorded in the Szczecin Lagoon. This was also the first record of the species in the Baltic Sea catchment. The quagga <b>mussel</b> was found to accompany the zebra <b>mussel</b> (Dreissena polymorpha), a non-indigenous bivalve already firmly established in the Lagoon. As indicated by the new immigrant's estimated abundance (4000. 0  ±  355. 44  ind.  m− 2) and the zebra <b>mussel</b> to quagga <b>mussel</b> abundance ratio (about 60 : 40), the immigration of D. rostriformis bugensis to the Lagoon can be regarded as successful. The quagga <b>mussel</b> has already formed a strong and reproducing population which co-occurs with that of the zebra <b>mussel</b> in the area...|$|R
5|$|Marine {{researchers}} {{note that}} mammals and birds {{get the most}} attention but smaller creatures {{at the base of}} the ocean food chain are also harmed by the oil. Life on the sea floor and near the shore such as <b>mussels,</b> barnacles, and other shellfish are unable to move out of the way. When exposed to oil, these organisms suffer 90%-plus mortality and recovery of the population can take decades.|$|E
5|$|More {{specialized}} carnivores {{include the}} shrewlike rats of the Philippines, which feed on insects and soft-bodied invertebrates, and the Australian water rat, which devours aquatic insects, fish, crustaceans, <b>mussels,</b> snails, frogs, birds' eggs, and water birds. The grasshopper mouse from dry regions of North America feeds on insects, scorpions, {{and other small}} mice, and {{only a small part}} of its diet is plant material. It has a chunky body with short legs and tail, but is agile and can easily overpower prey as large as itself.|$|E
5|$|North American river otters, {{like most}} predators, prey upon the most readily {{accessible}} species. Fish is a favored food among the otters, {{but they also}} consume various amphibians (such as salamanders and frogs), freshwater clams, <b>mussels,</b> snails, small turtles and crayfish. The most common fish consumed are perch, suckers, and catfish. Instances of river otters eating small mammals, such as mice and squirrels, and occasionally birds have been reported as well.|$|E

5|$|Research {{motivated}} by adhesive polyphenolic proteins in <b>mussels</b> {{led to the}} discovery in 2007 that {{a wide variety of}} materials, if placed in a solution of dopamine at slightly basic pH, will become coated with a layer of polymerized dopamine, often referred to as polydopamine. This polymerized dopamine forms by a spontaneous oxidation reaction, and is formally a type of melanin. Synthesis usually involves reaction of dopamine hydrochloride with Tris as a base in water. The structure of polydopamine is unknown.|$|E
