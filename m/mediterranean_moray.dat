50|$|One {{parasitic}} crustacean, the trematode Folliculovarium mediterraneum and the flatworm Lecithochirium grandiporum are parasites of the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>moray.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>moray</b> inhabits {{the coastal}} {{waters of the}} eastern Atlantic Ocean from the British Isles to the coast of Senegal; {{the waters of the}} Canary Islands and the Azores; and the Mediterranean Sea. It prefers rocky bottoms and lives in depths of from 16.5 to 264 feet (5 to 80 meters). It is a solitary and {{territorial}} species. The <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>moray</b> spends most of the day in cavities and clefts between rocks and is more active at night. It hunts fish, crayfish and cephalopods, but also feeds on dead animals.|$|E
50|$|The {{bite of the}} <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>moray</b> can be {{dangerous}} mainly due to the mildly toxic slime of its skin. It can be utilized fresh and eaten broiled, boiled and baked. The skin {{can be used for}} leather.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>moray's</b> {{reproduction}} {{is not well}} known. They spawn about 60,000 eggs into open water, from which planktonic transparent leptocephali hatch.|$|R
40|$|Moray eels {{are very}} common species, mainly in {{tropical}} and subtropical waters; nevertheless, {{they are very}} little studied. While the monophyly of the family is well-supported by phylogenetic studies, the species taxonomy is still controversial and some genera appear to be not-monophyletic. From cytogenetic point of view, only 20 of about 200 species have been studied {{and for most of}} them few karyological data are available. Beside a rather conserved diploid number of 42, morays display a greatly diversified karyotype structure and a large amount of heterochromatin. Chromosomal rearrangements as well as chromosome homologies have been reported in several species, resulting in divergent karyotype structures. To further investigate these cytogenetic features, the localization and distribution of specific sequences by FISH are essential for species with no genomic data but, to date, this molecular cytogenetic technique has been employed in very few moray species, with promising results. The karyotype of the <b>Mediterranean</b> brown <b>moray</b> eel Gymnothorax unicolor (Delaroche, 1809) was previous investigated and compared with the other Mediterranean species Muraena helena and with the congeneric species G. tile, by the use of classical techniques that pointed out many chromosomal banding similarities, as well as the occurrence of pericentric inversions and changes in heterochromatin amount. Furthermore, in this species FISH has been employed for the localization of centromeric, telomeric and 45 S ribosomal sequences. In order to extend the study of ribosomal genes in this species, in the present study we carried out the isolation, molecular characterization and chromosomal mapping of the 5 S sequences. These ribosomal genes have been interstitially localized in the acrocentric chromosome pair n. 10, different from the major ribosomal gene-bearing pair. Within the Muraenidae family, the minor ribosomal gene family has been recently mapped in other five species, pointing out with differences in the chromosomal distribution. G. unicolor is the only studied species with only one 5 S cluster, but a similar location on an acrocentric chromosome has been found in almost all other species. Furthermore a comparative analysis of the distribution of the two ribosomal gene families among morays have been carried out. These results, even if preliminary, provide novel karyological information for comparative genomic investigations and could also help to understand the cytotaxonomy of this family...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>moray</b> (sometimes {{also called}} Roman eel, Muraena helena,زريمباية) is a fish of the moray eel family. It {{has a long}} eel-like body and {{is found in the}} eastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Its bite can be {{dangerous}} to humans.|$|E
5000|$|The {{maritime}} {{reserve is}} home to various species of crustaceans, molluscs, and fishes including the common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), the Pinna nobilis clam that produces sea silk, the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>moray</b> (Muraena helena) that {{was regarded as a}} delicacy by the Romans, the garfish (Belone belone), and flying gurnard (Dactylopterus volitans), which uses its enlarged pectoral fins to [...] "walk" [...] along the ocean floor.

50|$|The <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>moray</b> has an elongated, eel-like {{body and}} can reach {{a length of}} 1.5 meters and weigh over 15 kilograms. Its {{coloration}} varies from dark grey to dark brown with fine dark spots. The skin is slimy and without scales. The dorsal fin begins behind its head and continues to the caudal fin (fused with the anal fin). Pectoral fins are absent, teeth are long and sharp-pointed (like other morays), the mouth is long and robust and reaches behind the gills.|$|E
50|$|The sea slug Chelidonura fulvipunctata was {{originally}} described from waters around Japan and is {{widespread in the}} eastern Indian Ocean and western Pacific. It was first identified in the Mediterranean in 1961 and {{was seen in the}} Red Sea in 2005, most likely as a result of anti-Lessepsian migration. In addition, a survey of polychaete worms in the southern Suez Canal found six species that were regarded as anti-Lessepsian migrants. Among the fish species that have been confirmed as anti-Lessepsian migrants are Solea aegyptiaca, <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>moray</b> Murea helena, comber Serranus cabrilla, European seabass Dicentrarchus labrax, and spotted seabass Dicentrarchus punctatus.|$|E
5000|$|Some of the {{tropical}} Muraenas exceed a length of 5 feet (150 cm), {{but most of the}} species, among them the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>moray,</b> are somewhat smaller. The latter, the [...] "murena" [...] of the Italians and the Muraena helena of ichthyologists, was considered by the ancient Romans {{to be one of the}} greatest delicacies, and was kept in large ponds and aquaria. It is not confined to the coasts of southern Europe, but is spread over the Indian Ocean, and is not uncommon on the coasts of Australia. Its body is generally of a rich brown, marked with large yellowish spots, each of which contains smaller brown spots.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the archaeological interest of the subaquatic park, the area {{is also an important}} registry of oceanic species and marine flora. From a medium depth of 15 m to approximately 35 m, the bottom of the bay includes rock and sand. The conditions provide useful characteristics for underwater photography, including geological features and maritime species. Since it is not considered a dangerous local area, diving both in the day and evening are possible.Here there are several marine species that are frequently visible: such as Whiteseabream or Sargo (Diplodus sargus), Common bream (Pagellus acarne), Dusky Groupers (Epinephelus marginatus), <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>moray</b> (Muraena helena), Salema porgy (Sarpa salpa), Almaco jack (Seriola rivoliana) and Common stingrays (Dasyatis pastinaca).|$|E

Other common freshwater fish include catfishes (Wels catfish and less common Aristotle catfish), the northern pike, burbot, and others.|$|E
50|$|Pictorial {{evidence}} of Roman fishing comes from mosaics. The Greco-Roman sea god Neptune {{is depicted as}} wielding a fishing trident. Fish was served only in earlier periods, and it remained more expensive than simpler meat types. Breeding was attempted in freshwater and saltwater ponds, but some kinds of fish could not be fattened in captivity. Among those that could was the formidable and potentially toxic <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>moray,</b> a valued delicacy which were reared ponds at the seaside. These morays were also kept as pets and sometimes {{as a means of}} punishment. Another farmed species was the popular, mullus, the goatfish. At a certain time this fish was considered the epitome of luxury, above all because its scales exhibit a bright red color when it dies out of water. For this reason these fish were occasionally allowed to die slowly at the table. There even was a recipe where this would take place in garo, in the sauce. At the beginning of the Imperial era, however, this custom suddenly came to an end, which is why mullus in the feast of Trimalchio (see the Satyricon) could be shown as a characteristic of the parvenu, who bores his guests with an unfashionable display of dying fish. The fish and fishing practices of the Roman era were recorded by the Greco-Roman Oppian of Cilicia, whose Halieutics was an expansive poem in hexameter composed between 177 and 180. It is the earliest such work to have survived to the modern day.|$|E
40|$|The Pessegueiro Island Marine Protected Area (MPA), SW {{coast of}} Portugal, was {{implemented}} in 2011 {{with the purpose}} of protect biodiversity and prevent over-exploitation of commercially important fish species. Amongst those species are the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>moray</b> (Muraena helena) and the European conger (Conger conger). In this context, the aim {{of this study was to}} assess the importance of this MPA as a refuge/feeding area for these species and to evaluate its location and size adequacy. The study was carried out during the summer of 2013 and a total of 19 morays and 6 congers were tagged with acoustic transmitters. An array of 19 automatic receivers was deployed with a sampling design that spatially covered the entire MPA. The data from the receivers was analysed through multivariate statistics (PERMANOVA), Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Network Analysis. Results showed that the Pessegueiro Island MPA is an important zone for both species since the tagged morays and congers spent 48 % of the time within the area (average residency index). Also, KDE and Network Analysis showed that both species displayed relatively reduced home ranges, 20 ha in average for morays and 30 ha for congers, and the movements performed were limited to adjacent areas. Activity was more intense during night time for both species. Regarding morays, lunar cycle and sea conditions also seemed to influence their movement patterns. The data collected in this study highlight the importance of this MPA for the target species...|$|E
40|$|Muraenidae is a species-rich family, with {{relationships}} among genera and species and taxonomy {{that have not}} been completely clarified. Few cytogenetic studies have been conducted on this family, and all of them showed the same diploid chromosome number (2 n= 42) but with conspicuous karyotypic variation among species. The <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>moray</b> eel Gymnothorax unicolor was previously cytogenetically studied using classical techniques that allowed the characterization of its karyotype structure and the constitutive heterochromatin and argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (Ag-NORs) distribution pattern. In the present study, we describe two new repetitive elements (called GuMbo I and GuDde I) obtained from restricted genomic DNA of G. unicolor that were characterized by Southern blot and physically localized by in situ hybridization on metaphase chromosomes. As they are highly repetitive DNA sequences, they map in heterochromatic regions. However, while GuDde I was localized in the centromeric regions, the GuMbo I fraction was distributed on some centromeres and was co-localized with the nucleolus organizer region (NOR). Comparative analysis with other Mediterranean species such as Muraena helena pointed out that these DNA fractions are species-specific and could potentially be used for species discrimination. As a new contribution to the karyotype of this species, we found that the major ribosomal genes are localized on acrocentric chromosome 9 and that the telomeres of each chromosome are composed of a tandem repeat derived from a poly-TTAGGG DNA sequence, as it occurs in most vertebrate species. The results obtained add new information useful in comparative genomics at the chromosomal level and contribute to the cytogenetic knowledge regarding this fish family, which has not been extensively studied...|$|E
40|$|Localization of the ribosomal {{genes in}} Anguilliformes (Chordata, Osteichthyes) E. Coluccia, R. Cannas, A. Milia, A. M. Deiana, S. Salvadori Dipartimento di Biologia Animale ed Ecologia, Università di Cagliari, Viale Poetto 1, 09126 Cagliari, Italy Keywords: Anguilliformes, FISH, ribosomal genes Ribosomal genes are {{organized}} in two multiple tandemly-arrayed units: the major family encoding for 28 S, 18 S and 5. 8 S rRNA and localized in the {{nucleolar organizer region}} (NOR), and the minor family encoding for 5 S rRNA. Their chromosomal localization represents useful markers for karyotype analysis and for {{the investigation of the}} phylogenetic relationships among related species, especially in fishes in which euchromatic structural banding patterns are difficult to obtain. In the present study, the chromosomal evolution of rDNA within the Anguilliformes order was studied through the mapping by FISH of the two ribosomal gene families in some species from different families, and by comparison with data on other Anguilliformes. 45 S rDNA has been mapped in Gymnothorax unicolor (Muraenidae), Conger conger (Congridae), Ophisurus serpens and Echelus myrus (Ophichthidae); it was detected only in a chromosome pair in all species, as in the other previously studied Anguilliformes. This situation is the most frequent in teleosteans. A terminal localization on the short arm of a submetacentric and subtelocentric chromosome pair was found in O. serpens and C. conger respectively; this is the most frequent situation among Anguilliformes and fishes in general; an interstitial location on a acrocentric chromosome pair was detected for G. unicolor and E. myrus. NOR is positive to silver staining and CMA 3 banding in all species in which these techniques have been applied. Between the two <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>moray</b> eels (Muraena helena and G. unicolor) a pericentric inversion involved the NOR bearing pair. The ribosomal gene families are located on separate chromosome pairs in Anguilla anguilla and A. rostrata  1, 2  and in most fishes. In the present study in M. helena, the 5 S gene family has been mapped on a pair other than NOR, while in C. conger, both 5 S and 45 S rDNA were clustered in the same chromosome region. 1 Martínez J.
