40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the effects of soil-structure {{interaction}} on the seismic response of reinforced concrete frames on <b>monopile</b> <b>foundations</b> connected by tie beams. Such systems are usually designed by considering fixed restraints at the column bases and the effects of the foundation compliance have not yet been investigated. The soil-foundation system is analysed in the frequency domain by means of a numerical model that allows obtaining the dynamic impedance functions of the system and the foundation input motion necessary for the subsequent nonlinear inertial soil-structure interaction analysis which is performed in the time domain. Tie beams with different stiffness and soil deposits characterised by three different profiles of shear wave velocity are considered. Results of incremental dynamic analyses carried out on frames with <b>monopile</b> <b>foundations</b> are compared with those obtained considering double-pile foundations and the fixed base assumption. Soil-structure interaction is found to affect considerably the response of frames on <b>monopile</b> <b>foundations</b> by increasing the structural deformation and modifying the evolution of the dissipative mechanisms. Analyses accounting for the actual soil-foundation system compliance and the foundation input motion may be crucial for a reliable prediction of the actual distribution of stresses in the superstructure and the foundation elements.

40|$|Effects of the {{embedded}} <b>monopile</b> <b>foundation</b> on {{the local}} distributions of pore water pressure, soil stresses, and liquefaction are investigated in this study using a three-dimensional integrated numerical model. The model {{is based on a}} Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes wave module and a fully dynamic poroelastic seabed module and has been validated with the analytical solution and experimental data. Results show that, compared to the situation without an embedded foundation, the embedded <b>monopile</b> <b>foundation</b> increases and decreases the maximum pore water pressure in the seabed around and below the foundation, respectively. The embedded <b>monopile</b> <b>foundation</b> also significantly modifies the distributions of the maximum effective soil stress around the foundation and causes a local concentration of soil stress below the two lower corners of foundation. A parametric study reveals that the effects of embedded <b>monopile</b> <b>foundation</b> on pore water pressure increase as the degrees of saturation and soil permeability decrease. The embedded <b>monopile</b> <b>foundation</b> tends to decrease the liquefaction depth around the structure, and this effect is relatively more obvious for greater degrees of saturation, greater soil permeabilities, and smaller wave heights...|$|E

40|$|A reliability-based design {{optimization}} (RBDO) of a <b>monopile</b> <b>foundation</b> for offshore wind turbines is conducted to optimize monopile design criteria by explicitly {{accounting for the}} effects of uncertainties. The RBDO in this study aims at optimizing cost of construction, installation and failure with respect to the ultimate limit state of a <b>monopile</b> <b>foundation</b> while accounting {{for the effects of}} uncertainties in soil parameters and lateral loads. Due to the inherent soil variability and measurement errors, a probabilistic link is constructed to model soil parameter interpretation from CPT data.

Advanced maximum likelihood procedures were employed to account for the effects of spatial correlation in the random field parameters of CPT measurements.

40|$|When {{building}} {{offshore wind}} turbines, a static scour protection is typically designed, allowing no movement of top layer stones under design conditions, {{leading to an}} often conservative design. Furthermore, little design guidelines exist for a scour protection around a <b>monopile</b> <b>foundation</b> under combined wave and current loading. In part 1 (De Vos et al., 2011), preceding this paper, a static design guideline for a scour protection around a monopile is suggested, based on a combined wave and current flow field. By allowing some movement of the top layer stones of the scour protection, a more economical design is obtained. This paper describes the derivation of a dynamic design formula to calculate the required stone size for a scour protection around a <b>monopile</b> <b>foundation</b> in a combined wave and current climate. The formula {{is based on the}} results of an experimental model study, described in this paper. The formula gives an expected damage level to the scour protection, based on the wave orbital velocity, wave period, steady current velocity, water depth, relative stone density and stone size.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to investigate the effects on tower dynamics when mounting a turbine on a <b>monopile</b> <b>foundation</b> offshore compared to a similar onshore installation. Changes in frequency, modeshapes and damping are investigated including effects of hydrodynamics and nonlinear soil properties. The tool used for the investigation is the new aeroelastic code HAWC 2, {{which is based on}} a multibody formulation. The multibody formulation used in the HAWC 2 code is very generally formulated which means that it can handle any structural object (body) as well as large rotations between the bodies and their associated nonlinear effects. This means e. g. that complex foundation types as very flexible monopile foundations, tripod structures and floating support structures can be simulated in the code. In the present investigation the <b>monopile</b> <b>foundation</b> will be considered. It is possible to apply non-linear springs and dampers on the structure, which are used for soil properties. In the hydrodynamic module of the code the hydrodynamic forces are calculated using Morisons equation.

The pile-driving construction process is an environmental concern as the noise produced is incredibly loud and propagates far in the water, even after mitigation strategies such as bubble shields, slow start, and acoustic cladding. The footprint is relatively small, but may still cause scouring or artificial reefs. Transmission lines also produce an electromagnetic field that may be harmful to some marine organisms.|$|R

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{has been used}} to study the boundary layer flow around three different bottom-fixed offshore wind turbine foundation designs. Two of the designs are gravity-based foundations, where one has a hexagonal bottom slab and one a circular bottom slab (bottom part). The third design is a monopile. Three-dimensional analyses have been performed with Spalart-Allmaras Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation using a Reynolds number 4 * 10 ^ 6 based on the free stream velocity and the diameter of the monopile, D. The boundary layer size is D in all the analyses. Time averaged results for velocities, pressure and bed shear stress were obtained. The dependence of the results on the mesh resolution was investigated and comparisons with published data were made. The results were found to be reasonably accurate. A distinct horseshoe vortex was found in front (upstream side) of the <b>monopile</b> <b>foundation.</b> Vortex shedding was present in the wake of all the foundations. Two smaller horseshoe vorticies were found in front of the hexagonal gravity-based foundation, were one was {{on the top of the}} bottom slab and one was near the seabed in front of the bottom slab. Three horseshoe vortices in total were found in front of the circular gravity-based foundation, due to the presence of two horseshoe vortices near the seabed in front of the bottom slab. A large region of downflow exists in front of the monopile, reaching all the way down to the seabed. This causes a backflow in front of the foundation near the seabed due to conservation of mass. The gravity-based foundations were found to have two main regions of downflow, one in front of the cylindrical shaft (upper part) on top of the bottom slab and a smaller region in front of the bottom slab near the seabed. The gravity-based designs are found to limit the downflow near the seabed. Pressure distributions around the foundations were studied. A positive vertical pressure gradient was found in front of the <b>monopile</b> <b>foundation.</b> It was also found in front of the cylindrical shaft and in front of the bottom slab near the seabed on the gravity-based foundations. A larger volume of increased pressure exists in front of the <b>monopile</b> <b>foundation</b> than in front of the gravity-based foundations due to its geometry. The bed shear stress in the flow direction along the upstream symmetryline on the seabed was investigated. The horseshoe vortex size, measured as the distance from the separation point to the foundation surface along this line, was found to be 0. 40 D for the <b>monopile</b> <b>foundation,</b> 0. 125 D for the hexagonal and 0. 22 D for the circular gravity-based foundation. Bed shear stress distributions near the foundations were obtained. The magnitude of the bed shear stress, normalized by the far field bed shear stress, was used. A maximum value of 4. 89 was found near the surface of the <b>monopile</b> <b>foundation</b> at phi = +- 66. 5 degrees, where phi is the angle measured from the stagnation point in front of the foundation. Similarly, 2. 86 at phi = +- 60. 1 was found for the hexagonal gravity-based foundation. The larger values of the hexagonal foundation are concentrated around the corners at phi = +- 60 degrees, and the rest of the seabed has shear stresses close to the far field shear stress. The results of the circular foundations were found to be slightly asymmetric, with a maximum value of 2. 59 at phi = 68. 9 degrees for the upper distribution (for positive phi) and 2. 72 at phi = - 85. 4 degrees for the lower (for negative phi) ...|$|E

Results show that biaxial loading significantly influenced the pile-head load-displacement response in addition to the development of significant accumulated displacements and coexistent soil loosening and densification. Moreover, predictions determined using a state-independent soil model were shown to be significantly nonconservative; these findings have important implications for environmental loading of offshore monopiles...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide {{energy demand}} is growing rapidly, {{and there is}} great {{interest}} in reducing the current reliance on fossil fuels for uses such as power generation, transportation, and manufacturing. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, are abundant but have very low power densities. The US {{is in the process}} of approving its first offshore wind farm, located in Nantucket Sound. Geotechnical factors will play a large role in the development of offshore wind projects due to the high cost contribution from foundations, and the high loads associated with storm conditions. Offshore wind turbine foundations provide unique design challenges. First, various foundation alternatives exist, so it is important that an appropriate cost-effective foundation type be selected. Second, the loads and soil conditions will vary for each location. Therefore, it is important to ensure the foundation can adequately support vertical and horizontal loads. Finally, each turbine manufacturer has unique deflection and rotation criteria. Therefore, the foundation should perform within those tolerances, even under worst-case loading. This thesis considers the performance of a <b>monopile</b> <b>foundation</b> under typical vertical and horizontal storm loading conditions. Capacity, deflection, and rotation of a proposed <b>monopile</b> <b>foundation</b> are calculated by various methods to simulate the design procedure. The results show that very stiff foundations are required to keep pile head movements within design tolerances. by Duncan Rath Kopp. Thesis (M. Eng.)
