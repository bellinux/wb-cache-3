40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} building a macromodel from frequency response measurements {{by means of a}} stable and passive linear dynamical system in state-space representation. The proposed algorithms are based on a system-theoretic tool, the matrix pencil of the shifted Loewner and Loewner matrices. Their performance is compared with that of the widely-used vector fitting in terms of the computational time required to build such a model and the accuracy of the interpolating system, when the same order model is constructed, and it is shown that our algorithms render better models in less time. Even though the main application we have in <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> modeling the scattering parameters of an electromagnetic device, no modifications are needed when the admittance parameters are provided instead. Last, our algorithms are especially suited for devices with a large number of ports because the data matrices <b>are</b> <b>collapsed</b> into vectors...|$|R

This does not mean it does not exist, it means that it exists in a manner that is counter to our ordinary way of misperceiving how phenomena exist, according to Buddhism. When the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> itself cognized properly, without misperceiving its mode of existence, it appears to exist like an illusion. There is a big difference however between being [...] "space and illusion" [...] and being [...] "space-like" [...] and [...] "illusion-like". <b>Mind</b> <b>is</b> not composed of space, it just shares some descriptive similarities to space. <b>Mind</b> <b>is</b> not an illusion, it just shares some descriptive qualities with illusions.|$|R
