500|$|It was at Milan, in {{particular}} under manager Carlo Ancelotti, where Pirlo made big strides in developing {{into a world}} class player, {{and one of the}} best deep-lying playmakers and set-piece specialists in the world, as he went on to achieve notable domestic and international success during his time with the club. Pirlo later recalled the period he has spent in Milan with Ancelotti: [...] "He changed my career, putting <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the defence. We shared some unforgettable moments. We had a magnificent past together." [...] After Mazzone's pioneering decision to move Pirlo into a deep-seated playmaking role with Brescia during the previous season, Milan managers Fatih Terim and, {{in particular}}, Carlo Ancelotti further developed this role for him at Milan. In Ancelotti's 4–3–1–2 and 4–3–2–1 formations, Pirlo was deployed as a deep-lying playmaker in front of the defence, which allowed him to play alongside other talented attacking midfielders, such as Rivaldo, Rui Costa and eventually Kaká, replacing the gap left by Milan legend Demetrio Albertini in the deep midfield playmaking role. He would become an integral part of the Rossoneri's midfield, forming a formidable partnership with Gennaro Gattuso, as well as with Clarence Seedorf and Massimo Ambrosini, who also supported his playmaking role defensively. Pirlo was given the nickname the metronome during his time at the club, for the way in which he set the team's rhythm.|$|E

2500|$|In November, Gillan {{revealed}} that the film was undergoing reshoots. That February, {{it was reported that}} the film had scored a perfect 100 in test screenings, the highest for any Marvel Studios film. The Hollywood Reporter noted this score could not necessarily be compared to any non-Marvel movies due to Marvel's specific testing process that selects its audience [...] "from a more select pool of recruits, what it terms 'friends and families screenings'". In March 2017, Gunn {{revealed that}} Michael Rosenbaum would appear in the film, and that Gunn would provide reference for Baby Groot's dancing [...] "in a much bigger way [...] I actually had to do like a full day's worth of dancing to get Groot's dance down this time. Last time it was <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of an iPhone, and this time it's me dancing on a huge soundstage and shooting it from five different angles." [...] Fred Raskin and Craig Wood returned from the first film to serve as editors. On scenes that were cut from the film, Gunn said Nathan Fillion, who had had a voice cameo in the first film, was going to appear as Simon Williams in a sequence that would have shown several movie posters for films starring Williams, including films in which he portrays Arkon and Tony Stark. Gunn chose Williams for Fillion's cameo because he wanted Fillion to have a bigger role in the MCU at some point and so didn't want to give him a role that could prevent him from taking a more substantial one later. Gunn still considered Fillion's cameo canon to the MCU, despite it being cut. He also confirmed that Close's scenes had been cut from the film, because it felt like he [...] "was trying to cram Nova Prime into the second movie as opposed to having it happen organically." ...|$|E
