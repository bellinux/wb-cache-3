The program serves twelve- to eighteen-year-old students from the eight school districts located in western Montgomery County. Originally established in 1976 as an alternative to institutionalization for socially <b>maladjusted</b> <b>youth,</b> PVA leased space in the Upper Perkiomen School District Administration Building. In June 1980, PVA made its home in a renovated tack shop on Route 73, in Obelisk, PA. In August 1994, PVA relocated to its current education/recreation facility located on Hoffmansville Road, in Frederick, Pennsylvania.|$|E
50|$|While {{attending}} Göteborgs Högre Samskola in Gothenburg, Henrik Berggren {{was looking}} for a way to express himself, and decided that the easiest way would be to form a pop band. The first six years of the band's existence consisted of a number of name changes until the band finally settled on the name Broder Daniel - translating to Brother Daniel. A couple of new members joined and they slowly started to find their sound. Swedish music press soon caught on to the hype of the now notorious band featuring charismatic singer Henrik who in a short time had gained a cult following of <b>maladjusted</b> <b>youth,</b> looking for a leader. Journalists, however, tended to mostly focus on the violent shows and Henrik's make-up and out of tune voice.|$|E

40|$|Structural {{equation}} modeling {{was used}} to delineate the relationship between sexual victimiza-tion and personality variables in the prediction of patterns of child molestation in adolescent males. Two hundred thirty-five adolescents, representing subsamples of sexually victimized and nonvictimized, perpetrating and nonperpetrating, and emotionally <b>maladjusted</b> and nonmalad-justed <b>youths,</b> participated in the study. Juvenile child molesters {{were found to have}} more pessi-mistic explanatory styles and deficits in self-sufficiency relative to nonoffending youths. A younger age at time of victimization, a greater number of incidents, a longer period of waiting to report the abuse, and a lower level of perceived family support postrevelation of the abuse were found to be predictive of subsequent sexual perpetration.

40|$|NEW CONTEXT. One of {{the most}} {{important}} things for the treatment of the <b>maladjusted</b> <b>youth</b> is a change of environment. For the Time Out Project to be a success, they need to be temporarily relocated in a complete alien context. Preferably somewhere foreign, because the language barrier will prevent them having too much contact with locals. A rural area with low stimuli from outside works really well. Ormoy. An old farm in the small village of Ormoy in the North-East of France, has been chosen for this project. “This village is well suited to take <b>maladjusted</b> <b>youth</b> to, because it is an environment with low stimuli. The house is on the outskirts of the village so it won’t disturbe the neighbours too much. ” SEPARATING SLEEPING & TREATMENT. The pressure on the youth to be treated can be very high. To help the youth take some distance from the treatment, there is a physical separation between the treatment and the sleeping. There are two buildings in which these two functions take place, with a separating garden in between. In the Sleeping-Building the architecture will play an active role in the treatment. And in the Treatment-Building the architecture will play a passive role. REWARD PROGRAM. When the youngster enters the project he or she will always start in the first room. It has a simple staircase leading up to the room. From the public space boxes in different colors can be seen can be seen. This box impersonates you. All you need is inside this box. In the first room this is only a desk, closet and a bed. In the second box you will get more facilities like a wash basin. This process continues. So the box grows with you.

On the {{programme}} of univer-sal development of socially <b>maladjusted</b> <b>youth</b> Among {{a whole range}} of offers of re-education available at the international market certain gaps exist, leading to the limitation of the effectiveness of the return of maladju-sted persons to society. The present article includes a suggestion of individual re-education programme of youth as well as life skills development allowing for effective functioning according to correct social roles. Perhaps, due to its comprehensive character, the present suggestion will serve to complement the formerly neglected areas of interaction.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to answer the {{question}} of whether the level of resiliency is combined with a sense of support received in the group of subjects. The study was conducted on a group of 174 teenagers of both sexes, aged 14 – 18 years. The study involved two groups of respondents. 112 individuals were classified as socially maladjusted and 62 as the controls. The study was conducted in attendance centres for adolescents at risk. SPP- 18, a Polish scale for measuring resiliency, designed by N. Oginska-Bulik and Z. Juczyński, and author’s own Support Factors Questionnaire, were used in the study. The following results were achieved: the overall level of resiliency and factors 1, 3, 4 was not significantly different in the compared groups. Socially maladjusted youths significantly differed from the controls in perseverance, determination in action and a sense of support from the school. Resiliency and the perceived support (family, school and peer) were correlated in the group of socially <b>maladjusted</b> <b>youth...</b>|$|E
40|$|Youth {{criminality}} {{has been}} a source of concern for criminologists and scholars of social problems. In Nigeria, empirical studies on youth criminality are largely focused on economic and socio-demographic characteristics of offenders. There is a dearth of research linking school maladjustment and family disruption to youth criminality, and this spurred us to embark on this study. A cross-sectional survey research design was adopted. Male inmates detained for the various offences of violent crime in Abakalike prisons constituted the target population. A Questionnaire was used in the data collection and descriptive statistical analysis was done. Using the prison records as a guide, we employed simple random sampling technique in the selection of 212 respondents. The findings show that there is a positive relationship between <b>maladjusted</b> behaviour and <b>youth</b> criminality. Also, chi-square values of 59. 002 and p > 0. 001 show a positive connection between family problems and youth offending behaviour. There is thus an urgent call for a proactive and sustainable youth empowerment; the teeming unemployed youth should be engaged in meaningful national reorientation and income-yielding activities to discourage them from contemplating crime...|$|R
40|$|Stressful {{life events}} that occur {{within the context}} of {{interpersonal}} relationships are problematic for adolescents. Peer victimization, a stressful interpersonal event, involves acts of both physical and verbal harassment, and can contribute to psychosocial maladjustment among youth. Direct verbal victimization is a specific form of peer victimization involving name-calling and teasing that is particularly prevalent among adolescents, but has rarely been studied separately from other types of victimization. This form of victimization is associated with adjustment problems, including anxiety and aggression among adolescents. Despite the significant association between direct verbal victimization and negative adolescent adjustment outcomes, not all youth who experience this stressor are <b>maladjusted.</b> Resilient <b>youth</b> may possess certain internal or external characteristics that protect them from the harmful impact of direct verbal victimization. Support from one 2 ̆ 7 s family is one of these external characteristics that has been shown to serve a protective function in the face of stress. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to use structural equation modeling techniques to examine the longitudinal impact of experiencing direct verbal victimization on adolescent 2 ̆ 7 s anxious and aggressive behaviors. This study also examined whether perceiving greater support from one 2 ̆ 7 s family served a protective function against the detrimental impact of direct verbal victimization on adolescent adjustment. In addition, this study examined an alternative relation between aggression and family support to assess whether adolescents who are highly aggressive perceive less support from their family over time. Participants included a predominantly African American sample of 632 adolescents participating in a larger project that evaluated the effectiveness of a school-based violence prevention program. As hypothesized, experiencing direct verbal victimization predicted changes in adolescent 2 ̆ 7 s reported level of anxiety over time. However, experiencing direct verbal victimization did not predict changes in the reported frequency of engaging in aggressive behavior. In addition, family support did not significantly buffer adolescents from the negative effects of direct verbal victimization. Although, there were no gender differences in the impact of direct verbal victimization on anxiety and aggression, being female significantly predicted increases in level of anxiety. Overall, the current study 2 ̆ 7 s findings confirm that direct verbal victimization is a highly prevalent and distressing problem for urban African-American adolescents, and suggest that it has a significant longitudinal effect on adolescent adjustment. These findings have important implications for violence prevention interventions...|$|R
40|$|Peer victimization is {{characterized}} by acts of physical, relational, and verbal aggression that can contribute to maladjustment. Youths’ responses to peer victimization are guided by social information-processing (SIP) skills that impact their adjustment. Maladjustment can contribute to biases in SIP. Biased processing occurs when youth rely on existing schemas without attending to cues from the immediate social context. These processing deficits contribute to the enactment of problematic responses {{that may lead to}} further maladjustment. However, not all youth exhibit SIP deficits. A recent study identified four adjustment clusters based on differences in aggression, anxiety, depression, social acceptance, and victimization within a predominantly African American sample of adolescents (Sullivan 2 ̆ 6 Farrell, 2008). These clusters included aggressive-victims, passive-victims, neglected youth, and well-adjusted youth. Data suggest that cluster membership influences SIP and responses to peer victimization. This study used latent profile analysis (LPA) and the Articulated Thoughts in Simulated Situations (ATSS) paradigm, a think-aloud approach to cognitive assessment, to examine differences in SIP between well-adjusted youth and subgroups of <b>maladjusted</b> <b>youth</b> in response to simulated peer victimization situations. Participants included a primarily African American sample of 523 sixth grade students who completed a series of self-report measures of adjustment. LPA identified a four-class solution that included: Aggressive-victims, Aggressors, Passive-victims, and Well-adjusted youth. This model closely approximated the clusters previously identified. However, the current solution includes a purely aggressive group whereas the prior solution contained a neglected group. A sub-sample of 176 students was then randomly selected to complete ATSS interviews. Logistic regression was used to examine SIP pattern differences across the groups. As hypothesized, aggressors and aggressive-victims {{were more likely to report}} intentions to engage in physical aggression compared to well-adjusted youth. In addition, aggressors were more likely to report beliefs that it is ok to fight in response to physical aggression compared to their well-adjusted peers. Further, well-adjusted youth were more likely to report intentions to behave nonviolently compared to their maladjusted peers. However, six of the ten hypotheses were not supported. Additional findings related to gender differences and situation-specific SIP patterns were identified. These findings have important implications for violence prevention interventions...|$|E
