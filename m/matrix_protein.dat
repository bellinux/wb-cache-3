5|$|Calcium ions may be {{complexed}} by proteins through binding the {{carboxyl groups}} of glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues; or by being chelated by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; osteocalcin, a bone <b>matrix</b> <b>protein,</b> uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both {{the first and}} the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface. As an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds, monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0mM and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix is tricalcium phosphate at 100µM.|$|E

40|$|AbstractExtracellular <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> {{form the}} basic {{structure}} of blood vessels. Along with providing basic structural support to blood vessels, <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> interact with different sets of vascular cells via cell surface integrin or non-integrin receptors. Such interactions induce vascular cell de novo synthesis of new <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> during blood vessel development or remodeling. Under pathological conditions, vascular <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> undergo proteolytic processing, yielding bioactive fragments to influence vascular wall matrix remodeling. Vascular cells also produce alternatively spliced variants that induce vascular cell production of different <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> to interrupt <b>matrix</b> homeostasis, leading to increased blood vessel stiffness; vascular cell migration, proliferation, or death; or vascular wall leakage and rupture. Destruction of vascular <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> leads to vascular cell or blood-borne leukocyte accumulation, proliferation, and neointima formation within the vascular wall; blood vessels prone to uncontrolled enlargement during blood flow diastole; tortuous vein development; and neovascularization from existing pathological tissue microvessels.

We have used imaging techniques {{to understand the}} relationship between the cis-medial Golgi <b>matrix</b> and transmembrane <b>proteins</b> during retrograde traffic in control and brefeldin A (BFA) -treated cells. All five of the cis-medial <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> tested were associated with retrograde tubules within 2 - 3 min of initiation of tubule formation. Then, at later time points (3 - 10 min), transmembrane proteins are apparent in the same tubules. Strikingly, both the <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> and the transmembrane proteins moved directly to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites labeled with p 58 and Sec 13, and {{there seemed to be a}} specific interaction between the ER exit sites and the tips or branch points of the tubules enriched for the <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins.</b> After the initial interaction, Golgi <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> accumulated rapidly (5 - 10 min) at ER exit sites, and Golgi transmembrane proteins accumulated at the same sites ∼ 2 h later.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the aberrant expression of nuclear <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> in human gastric cancer cells {{before and after}} hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) treatment. METHODS: Proteomics analysis of differential nuclear <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> was performed by two dimensional electrophoresis polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The expression levels of three nuclear <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> were further confirmed by Western blotting and their locations in nuclear matrix filament were observed by quantum dots-based immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Proteomics analysis showed that 43 protein spots were significantly changed due to HMBA treatment. Fifteen proteins were identified in the HMBA-induced differentiation of gastric tumor cells. Eight proteins spots were down-regulated while seven were up-regulated. Among these proteins, prohibitin, nucleophosmin and hnRNP A 2 /B 1 were significantly decreased in HMBA-treated human gastric cancer cells, and their locations in nuclear matrix were altered by HMBA. Our results proved the alteration of specific nuclear <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> during the differentiation of human gastric cancer cells. And the aberrant expressions of nuclear <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> were of significance in revealing the regulatory mechanism of tumor cell proliferation and differentiation. CONCLUSION: The aberrant expressions and intracellular redistributions of nuclear <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> before and after HMBA treatment indicated that nuclear <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> play {{a pivotal role in}} the differentiation of gastric cancer cells.

40|$|During mitosis, the {{mammalian}} Golgi disassembles into numerous vesicles {{and larger}} membrane structures {{referred to as}} clusters or remnants. Following mitosis, the vesicles and clusters reassemble to form an intact Golgi in each daughter cell. One model of Golgi biogenesis states that Golgi <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> remain assembled in mitotic clusters and then serve as a template for Golgi reassembly. To test this idea, we performed a 3 D-computational analysis of mitotic cells {{to determine the extent}} to which these proteins remain in mitotic clusters. As a control we used brefeldin A-induced Golgi disassembly which causes dispersal of Golgi enzymes, but leaves <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> in remnant structures. Unlike brefeldin A-treated cells, in which <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> were clearly sorted from non-matrix proteins, we observed extensive dispersal of <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> in metaphase cells with no evidence of differential sorting of these proteins from other Golgi proteins.

40|$|The plant Golgi {{apparatus}} plays {{a central}} role in the secretory pathway, being the site of protein glycosylation, sorting and the synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides and glycolipids. Golgi <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> are involved in the formation and maintenance of the Golgi stack and putative plant homologues have been identified, but their general function and role in plant Golgi biogenesis still is unknown. To study Golgi biogenesis, the Golgi was disrupted using both the drug Brefeldin A (BFA) and a mutated GTP-Iocked form of the small GTPase Sarlp, blocking protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. As prolonged expression of Sarl-GTP is toxic to cells, the gene was inserted into a dexamethasone-inducible promoter system, allowing controlled expression and Golgi disruption. The system was characterised by live cell imaging of fluorescent Golgi and ER exit site markers and at the ultrastructural level by electron microscopy. A novel method to reverse the dexamethasone-inducib'e system in tobacco using the glucocorticoid antagonist RU 486 was established. The subcellular location of the Golgi <b>matrix</b> <b>proteins</b> GFP-AtCASP, GFP-golgin- 84, AtGRIP-GFP and GFP-TMF and other Golgi markers fused to fluorescent proteins was studied during Golgi disruption and reformation.
