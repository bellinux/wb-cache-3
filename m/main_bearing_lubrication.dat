5000|$|The 700S {{continued}} to be developed at the Darley Abbey works in Derbyshire, along with the SPR Production Racing version. [...] Production was slow, with just two motorcycles a week coming off the production line. Customers could select from five colour schemes - British Racing Green, metallic blue or green, black with gold coachlines or plain red. There was also a Scott special edition in purple and cream - and a special scheme similar to Silk Cut cigarettes, which were popular at the time.As a precision engineering company, Silk {{were able to make}} the piston port twin cylinder engine in-house at their Derbyshire workshops. The pressed up, four roller bearing crank had the primary drive taken from the crankshaft centre, to an inverted Velocette Venom four-speed gearbox. The two stroke engine ran on a 50:1 petroil mix, with a separate oil tank reserved for <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>lubrication</b> fed by Silk's own design of oil pump. When the rider opened the throttle the oil flowed faster, ensuring best possible lubrication. The engine's claimed 48 bhp was developed at 6,000rpm, giving good touring performance, and peak torque was at 3,000rpm, comparable to the Suzuki GT750. Twin siamesed exhaust pipes fed an Ossa silencer. The wheels on early models were 18 inch Borrani alloy rims, replaced with six spoke Campagnolo cast wheels on later Silks. The final drive chain was enclosed for longer life.|$|E
40|$|This {{article from}} the {{analysis}} of the power consumption of the ball mill and the work characteristic of the motor, analyzes the fault reason of ball mill transmission equipment. The paper mainly deals with a side-transmission ball mill. The main fault is about the breakdown in the elastic rubber coupling of the transmission system. It is found {{from the analysis}} of the real cases and data that the actual power consumption is increased and it is caused by the overload. The main parameters which influence the ball mill power consumption are load of the mill, feed material mass, ball mill rotational speed and friction. The main part of power consumption for ball mill is used to elevating grinding body and material, a portion is used to overcome the friction force between the main bearing. Under the conditions in which the load of the mill and feed material mass are kept the same, the parameters which influence the ball mill power consumption are rotational speed and friction status. When the ball mill voltage decreased, according to the motor characteristics, its rotation speed will decrease, which will disrupt the hydrodynamic lubrication state of the hollow shaft and spherical surface, so that the power consumption of the ball mill increase. The larger power leads to the transmission fault. This paper also put forward to make sure kept the ball mill <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>lubrication</b> status. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{analysis}} for operating characteristics of journal <b>bearing</b> <b>lubrication</b> system is performed {{based on the}} numerical model. Dynamic <b>bearing</b> <b>lubrication</b> characteristics such as oil film pressure and thickness distribution can be analyzed through a numerical model with an integration of elastohydrodynamics and multi-flexible-body dynamics (MFBD). In particular, the oil film thickness variation by elastic deformation is considered in the elastohydrodynamic analysis by applying the bending stiffness effect of journal. And the oil film thickness variation by the bending stiffness effect {{is applied to the}} fluid governing equations to calculate the oil film pressure in the elastohydrodynamic lubrication region. A series of process proposed in this study is available for the analysis of realistic elastohydrodynamic lubrication phenomenon. Also, a numerical example for the journal <b>bearing</b> <b>lubrication</b> system is demonstrated and compared with the experimental results.

40|$|Volvo Car Corporation uses a new {{generation}} of four cylinder inline engines in their automobiles. The engine family is known as Volvo Engine Architecture and the differences between the different engines are the different power outputs made possible with different engine boosts. The VEA engines utilise a bedplate design for their engines where the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports are casted into the bedplate. For the high performance engines the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports need to be sprayed with an aluminium alloy to get a strong bonding with the bedplate. The spraying is, however, expensive and an alternative solution is sought. Four design proposals, which are based on the current design of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports, were proposed. These design proposals does not use any of the sprayed aluminium alloy material. Instead they have been designed with the goal of getting a mechanical bonding, instead of the chemical bonding that the aluminium alloy coating provides. The design proposals were evaluated by static simulations and dynamic simulations to investigate the influence on the <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> in terms of: • radial deformations of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> profiles, • total pressure and asperity contact pressure and • friction losses. The contact behaviour between the bedplate and the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports, for the different design proposals, at high temperature were also investigated. The results from the simulations were compared to results from earlier work on the sprayed <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports. None of the design proposals generally provided lower friction losses compared to the sprayed <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> support. The differences in friction loss should also by weighed against the potential cost saving, which is a question for VCC. The sprayed <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports showed in general higher asperity contact pressure compared to the design proposals. Most of the bonding between the bedplate and the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports occurred on the top surfaces and the sides of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports for the different design proposals. An investigation of getting fatigue failure in the bedplate should also be considered, if VCC should proceed with {{one or more of the}} design proposals.

40|$|The {{studies on}} the cause of fault at machine {{elements}} and materials have been explained by many authors already. But, the studies of actual machine parts {{under the influence of}} dynamic load are rare explained. Here the studies of breakage in <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> siud at diesel engine are achieved and its solutlhn is proved. The results are summarized as follows: 1. The insufficient rigidity of engine bed is most cause of breakage in <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> studs at diesel engine. 2. Seconrlly, the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> stud suffered severe load by the weak structure of <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> cap and therfore the better type of structure is recommended by the writer. 3. Tightness of <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> is important too. The maximum tensile stress of <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> studis about 2 times in comparison with one of the other studby fault of tighting and its value indicates about 28 kg/㎟. ディーゼル機関に於て主軸受スタッドの切損を屡々見受ける。この切損の特徴として，その装着位置からして早期発見が仲々むつかしく従って慨事故を発見した時は主軸受メタルの焼付・亀裂又はクランクジャーナル部の偏摩粍等を併発している事が多く，甚だしきに至っては機関台床亀裂等の大事故を起し機関再選転を不能ならしめた例もある。筆者の過去数年間に互る調査結果より推察すると，概切損事故の特色は機関主軸受NO・としてクランク両・端側の主軸受（例えば 7 シリンダ機関ではNO・ 1 及 8 主軸受）には事故皆無であり，切損の過半数は中央主軸受（ 7 シリンダ機関ではNO・ 4 及 5 主軸受）に発生している事である。尚スタッドの切損個所としてはスタッド植込部からが殆んどである。此等の調査結果を本稿中の表- 1 に示してある。主軸受スタッド切損に就て調査研究並びにこれに基ずく実験を行い，その原因を究明し得たのでその対策と併せて茲に発表する...|$|R

5000|$|Crankshafts on six-cylinder engines {{generally}} have either four or seven <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b> Larger engines and diesels {{tend to use}} seven bearings because of high loadings and to avoid crankshaft flex. Because of the six-cylinder engine's smooth characteristic, {{there is a tendency}} for a driver to load the engine at low engine speeds. This can produce crankshaft flex in four <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> designs where the crank spans the distance of two cylinders between <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b> This distance is longer than the distance between two adjacent <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> on a V6 with four mains, because the V6 has cylinder bores on opposite banks which overlap significantly; the overlap may be as high as 100%, minus the width of one connecting rod (1.00" [...] or so). In addition, modern high-compression engines subject the crankshaft to greater bending loads from higher peak gas pressures, requiring the crankthrows to have greater support from adjacent bearings, so it is now customary to design straight-sixes with seven <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b>|$|R
