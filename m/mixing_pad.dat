40|$|Friction {{material}} in a brake system {{plays an important}} role for effective and safe brake performance. Brake materials contain mainlyAlumina and other ingredients. This research attempts to examine mechanical properties of Boron <b>mixed</b> brake <b>pads.</b> Five groups of semi-metallic composite materials were studied. Friction coefficient of Boron mixed and commercial brake pads were significantly different. Average friction coefficient of Boron <b>mixed</b> <b>pads</b> was 0. 495, 0. 065 higher than commercial pad. Abrupt reduction of friction coefficient which is known as fade was more significant in the commercial pad samples than in Boron <b>mixed</b> <b>pads.</b> Fade occurred in commercial pad sample at the lower temperature as first fade was at 204 oC and second was at 159 oC resulted from earlier softening and degradation of Alumina material. All Boron pads were more stable and constant than their commercial counterparts. The study shows a slight reduction of friction coefficient at a temperature of 204 oC during the first fade and 238 oC on the second for Boron <b>mixed</b> <b>pads.</b> Both commercial and Boron <b>mixed</b> brake <b>pads</b> showed normal recovery stage in that they returned to their pre-fade friction coefficient levels with little temperature reduction. Properties of Boron <b>mixed</b> brake <b>pads</b> are better than Commercial brake pads.  2013 Trade Science Inc. - INDI...|$|R
40|$|Friction {{material}} in an automotive brake system {{plays an important}} role for effective and safe brake performance. A single material has never been sufficient to solve performance related issues. Current research aimed to examine properties of Boron <b>mixed</b> brake <b>pads</b> by comparing them with the commercial brake pads. Friction coefficient of Boron <b>mixed</b> brake <b>pads</b> and commercial brake pads were significantly different and increased with the increase in surface roughness. The abrupt reduction of friction coefficient is more significant in commercial brake pad samples than in Boron <b>mixed</b> brake <b>pad</b> formulations.

30|$|While our {{experiments}} {{were conducted on}} tweet sentiment data, our approach {{can be applied to}} all text classification tasks. 1 -of-m encoding has already been demonstrated to work in multiple text classification domains [1]. Future work should continue to investigate network design when using log-m embedding and performance of on longer text documents should be investigated. Also, while padding allows deep networks to be constructed with a variety of architectures, it does increase training time. <b>Mixing</b> <b>padded</b> and non-padded layers may help improve training time. Alternatively, non-square convolutional filters and max pooling layers could be implemented to allow deeper networks to be trained without relying on padding and should be investigated. Experiments should be extended to include text in other languages, since our proposed embedding should be far more efficient than 1 -of-m embedding or word embeddings when using text with thousands of unique characters, such as Chinese.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} {{and evaluation of}} maize husks as asbestos-free friction material {{for the production of}} automotive brake pad was carried out in this work. Asbestos friction material that has been used for over 80 years was found to be carcinogenic in nature and has prompted several research efforts for its replacement from brake pads. Three sets of composite compositions were made using maize husks as filler material to impart friction properties with varied epoxy resin contents as the matrix that bonded the particles in the <b>mix.</b> Brake <b>pad</b> specimens were made out of the composites and subjected to mechanical, physical and tribological analyses to ascertain their possible performance in service using standard test procedures, materials and equipment. The particulate size of the MH filler material was 300 µm and epoxy resin was in slurry. The result showed that specimen composite 3 with 30 % MH filler content having coefficient of friction, abrasion resistance, water absorption, oil absorption, density, hardness, tensile strength, compressive strength, and thermal conductivity o...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{investigation}} of new materials {{to replace the}} asbestos has started to be considered. Brake pads used in automotive industry contain materials composed of more than ten different ingredients. In this study, the use of Rice Straw Dust (RSD) and Rice Husk Dust (RHD) has been investigated for assessing the tribological properties of brake pads. RSD and RHD both have silica in them which gives the pad materials a ceramic like behavior. To obtain RSD and RHD, rice straw and rice husk were grained {{after they have been}} dried. Different amounts of RSD and RHD were included in the brake <b>pad</b> <b>mix</b> along with the other regular ingredients. These newly formulated brake pads have been tested under Friction Assessment and Screening Test (FAST). Friction coefficient, wear rate and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) for friction surfaces were examined to assess the performance of these samples...|$|R

40|$|Stanniocalcin- 1 (STC- 1) is a nerve cell-enriched protein {{involved}} in intracellular calcium homeostasis regulation. Changes in calcium regulation are hypothesized {{to play a}} role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The expression of STC- 1 increases in response to ischemic stroke, but whether it is altered in neurodegenerative disorder, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), has not been investigated before. We measured STC- 1 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from a total of 163 individuals including AD, prodromal AD (<b>pAD),</b> <b>mixed</b> AD, stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI), and diagnoses of other dementia than AD, as well as cognitively normal controls (CNC) enrolled at academic centers in France and Sweden. STC- 1 concentration was reliably measureable in all CSF samples and was significantly increased in the initial exploratory cohort of neurochemically enriched AD patients versus AD biomarker-negative controls. In the second cohort, STC- 1 was increased in AD versus pAD, and other dementia disorders, but the difference was not statistically significant. In the third cohort, there was no significant difference in STC- 1 concentration between AD and CNC; however, STC- 1 concentration was significantly decreased in patients with other dementia disorders compared with AD and CNC. Taken together, CSF STC- 1 showed an increasing trend in AD, but the findings were not consistent across the three study cohorts. In contrast, CSF STC- 1 concentrations were reduced in patients with dementia diagnoses other than AD, as compared with both AD patients and CNC. The findings from these studies suggest CSF STC- 1 as a potential biomarker in differential diagnosis of dementias...|$|R

40|$|Two typical {{scrubber}} internals are {{studied in}} this thesis, inlet vane and wire mesh pads. A total of 8 wire mesh pads were studied at {{low and high}} pressure conditions. The inlet vane was studied at high pressure. The measurements performed at elevated pressures were performed at 20, 50 and 85 bars for a N 2 /Exxsol system {{as well as a}} synthetic natural gas <b>mix.</b> The mesh <b>pads</b> studied varied in height, specific surface area, wire packing density, wire diameter as well as porosity. Liquid holdup measurements were made at five vertical positions and in addition pressure drop and separation efficiency were measured. The results show variations in holdup profile depending on liquid load, pad geometry, running time, measuring position and interfacial properties. Droplet size measurements were also made for all wire mesh pads below and at flooding of the wire mesh pads. A new equation was developed that qualitatively describes aspects of wire mesh pad design and was used for developing correlations. A novel method for measuring flooding point was developed and flooding points for several inlet pipe liquid volume fractions were made. A correlation predicting flooding points in wire mesh pads at both low and high pressure was developed. Dry pressure drop for all wire mesh pads was also determined. A correlation predicting dry pressure drop for spiral wound pads was developed. A novel method for measuring scrubber efficiency above a inlet vane at varying vertical positions was developed. The separation efficiency was measured at five different vertical positions in a scrubber column with an inner diameter of 252 mm. In addition a column of 150 mm was investigated at one position. Liquid fraction measurements were made at two vertical positions to asses flow distribution. Droplet size measurements were also performed 127. 5 mm above the inlet vane.
