They used ideographic or early <b>mnemonic</b> <b>symbols</b> or both to convey information yet were likely devoid of linguistic content. These systems emerged in the early Neolithic, {{as early as the}} 7th millennium BCE.|$|R

Included are the collective memories of daily headlines and images from pop-culture, as well as personal memories from my own history. Contemporary society is constantly inundated with emotionally charged imagery that aims to shock viewers by appealing to their sensibilities. By reworking the images to avoid shock and specificity, my artwork turns these depictions into <b>mnemonic</b> <b>symbols</b> that stir the mind with associations. Advisor: Aaron Hol...|$|R
25|$|The {{mainstream}} academic {{theory is}} that writing first appeared during the Sumerian civilisation in southern Mesopotamia, around 3300–3200 BC. {{in the form of}} the Cuneiform script. This first writing system did not suddenly appear out of nowhere, but gradually developed from less stylised pictographic systems that used ideographic and <b>mnemonic</b> <b>symbols</b> that contained meaning, but did not have the linguistic flexibility of the natural language writing system that the Sumerians first conceived. These earlier symbolic systems have been labelled as proto-writing, examples of which have been discovered in a variety of places around the world, some dating back to the 7th millennium BC.|$|R
25|$|Writing {{systems were}} preceded by proto-writing, which used pictograms, ideograms and other <b>mnemonic</b> <b>symbols.</b> Proto-writing lacked {{the ability to}} capture and express {{a full range of}} {{thoughts}} and ideas. The invention of writing systems, which dates {{back to the beginning of}} the Bronze Age in the late Neolithic Era of the late 4th millennium BC, enabled the accurate durable recording of human history in a manner that was not prone to the same types of error to which oral history is vulnerable. Soon after, writing provided a reliable form of long distance communication. With the advent of publishing, it provided the medium for an early form of mass communication.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the various {{possible}} symbolic mnemonic devices that the ‘Cretan labyrinth’ can be constructed from. The ‘Cretan labyrinth’ has been used throughout history, sometimes as graffiti. Yet it has a complex and difficult structure, not a structure that you would expect to find in graffiti that would have been constructed in a hurry. The structure does suggest that it was drawn from the center expanded out form a very simple symbol. This paper concentrates on all the possible different ways of constructing it. These simple <b>mnemonic</b> <b>symbols</b> may explain the longevity and popularity of the complex structure of the ‘Cretan labyrinth’...|$|R

25|$|In {{the history}} of how systems of {{representation}} of language through graphic means have evolved in different human civilizations, more complete writing systems were preceded by proto-writing, systems of ideographic or early <b>mnemonic</b> <b>symbols.</b> True writing, in which the content of a linguistic utterance is encoded so that another reader can reconstruct, with a fair degree of accuracy, the exact utterance written down, is a later development. It is distinguished from proto-writing, which typically avoids encoding grammatical words and affixes, {{making it more difficult}} or impossible to reconstruct the exact meaning intended by the writer unless a great deal of context is already known in advance. One of the earliest forms of written expression is cuneiform.|$|R

2500|$|No {{standard}} terminology exists; each {{author is}} responsible for defining in prose the meanings of their <b>mnemonics</b> or <b>symbols.</b> Many authors use a [...] "register-transfer"-like symbolism to explain the actions of their models, but again {{they are responsible for}} defining its syntax.|$|R
50|$|Assembly {{language}} {{source code}} generally permits {{the use of}} constants and programmer comments. These are usually removed from the assembled machine code by the assembler. If so, a disassembler operating on the machine code would produce disassembly lacking these constants and comments; the disassembled output becomes more difficult for a human to interpret than the original annotated source code. Some disassemblers provide a built-in code commenting feature where the generated output gets enriched with comments regarding called API functions or parameters of called functions. Some disassemblers {{make use of the}} symbolic debugging information present in object files such as ELF. For example, IDA allows the human user to make up <b>mnemonic</b> <b>symbols</b> for values or regions of code in an interactive session: human insight applied to the disassembly process often parallels human creativity in the code writing process.|$|R
5000|$|A {{mnemonic}} used {{by students}} {{to remember the}} Maxwell relations (in thermodynamics) is [...] "Good Physicists Have Studied Under Very Fine Teachers", which helps them remember {{the order of the}} variables in the square, in clockwise direction. Another mnemonic used here is [...] "Valid Facts and Theoretical Understanding Generate Solutions to Hard Problems", which gives the letter in the normal left-to-right writing direction. Both times A has to be identified with F, another common symbol for Helmholtz' Free Energy. To prevent the need for this switch the following mnemonic is also widely used:"Good Physicists Have Studied Under Very Ambitious Teachers". One other useful variation of the <b>mnemonic</b> when the <b>symbol</b> E is used for internal energy instead of U is the following: [...] "Some Hard Problems Go To Finish Very Easy".|$|R
40|$|Cognitive {{instruments}} (words, other <b>symbols,</b> <b>mnemonic</b> images, {{and countless}} other things) are, for the most part, heuristic devices deployed in experimental contexts. They {{are not so much}} means of consolidating and organizing what we already know; they are rather means of probing, of exploring yet uncharted fields (often fields opened by these very devices). Maps, too, are not simply records of terrain already charted. They are indispensable instruments of experimental thought. This potential is based on the diagrammatic nature of maps, which combines the map’s indexical functions with its iconic qualities. Diagrammatization involves both likeness and analogy, which makes the map an efficient tool not only for exploring unknown territories but also for making visible structures and new relationships that no verbal description could reveal. But what makes the map such an immensely useful prosthesis for exploration is its inherent potential to provide the possibility to derive new information from it that is not in itself contained in it. This is also what accounts for the foremost function of the diagram, namely that it expands the field of possibilities so that even more innovative experiments can be performed and, thus, enables novel exploration. It is this capacity that makes diagrams indispensible cognitive tools as they not only reveal unsuspected relationships but also produce new knowledge. That may also explain the close link among subjectivity, writing, art practices and cartography: maps seem to inspire ventures into new realms within practices of writing and the arts, on the one hand, and the cartographic impulse, on the other. Analysing the use of maps since rock art carvings through the Antique and medieval mappae mundi up to contemporary map art, this paper looks at how writers and artists incorporate essential characteristics of maps and mapping into their works and in so doing, make full use of space as a medium of representation in order to explore new knowledge space and to develop new ways in which to articulate both its potential and limitations of representation...|$|R
