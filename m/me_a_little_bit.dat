500|$|Musically, [...] "All the Lovers" [...] is an electropop-influenced disco track. Minogue's breathy and whisper-y vocal {{delivery}} and the electronic {{production of the}} song make it similar to [...] "I Believe in You", a single from Minogue's greatest hits album Ultimate Kylie (2004). Through the lyrics of the song, Minogue invites her lover to dance with her, beginning with a line in which she softly sings [...] "Dance, it's all I wanna do, so won't you dance? I'm standing here with you, why won't you move?". During the anthemic chorus of the song, which is backed by a warbling synthesizer riff, Minogue asserts that her previous relationships do not [...] "compare" [...] to her present one, singing [...] "All the lovers that have gone before, they don't compare to you/ Don't be frightened, just give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more/ They don't compare, all the lovers." [...] UK-based music website Popjustice opined that the song is [...] "not really about relaxing while you dance, it's about relaxing into a relationship." [...] Fraser McAlpine from BBC Chart Blog felt the [...] "elegiac" [...] and sad-toned chorus [...] "makes the verses transform from a straightforward plea for dancefloor action into what sounds like a demand that everyone join Kylie for one last dance before things become spoiled forever." [...] The song features a bridge section in which Minogue again asks her lover to dance with her, after which an electronic breakdown takes place. According to the sheet music of the song published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "All the Lovers" [...] is composed in the key of C major and follows a midtempo of 142 beats per minute. Minogue's vocal range spans from the key of G3 to A4.|$|E

[...] He says that he does believe in [...] "the spiritual and mystical part of the world", including practicing yoga, but his moral precepts [...] "aren't informed in any way by religious doctrine or, like, organized religion or anything." ...|$|E

He also found {{returning}} to the stage difficult because of his long departure.

And looking back now it still frightens <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> to think that so much of my life was totally devoted to Star Trek and almost nothing else." ...|$|E

One of the researchers targeted said, [...] "It worries <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit...</b> I mean, anytime someone threatens you physically I think it causes worry." [...] The Animal Liberation Brigade said in a communique re-released by the Animal Liberation Press Office that the act was not a hoax, with officials at the primate center claiming threats and protests have happened before and were unacceptable.|$|E
2500|$|Scissor Sisters {{spent much}} of 2008 and early 2009 in the {{recording}} studio. However, after working on new material for approximately 18 months, the band decided to shelve their third album. Shears explained: [...] "In my heart I knew it wasn't right. I didn't really {{know what it was}} trying to say. It left <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> cold." [...] Reportedly, an entire record had been worked on but that the group had [...] "shelved it about a year ago."

2500|$|Malfoy {{grew into}} one of the series' most popular {{characters}} due to Felton's performances and Felton quickly became synonymous with the character to many female fans, much to Rowling's dismay. [...] "I'm trying to clearly distinguish between Tom Felton, who is a good looking young boy, and Draco, who, whatever he looks like, is not a nice man. It’s a romantic, but unhealthy, and unfortunately all too common delusion of girls ... it actually worried <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> to see young girls swearing undying devotion to this really imperfect character ... I mean, I understand the psychology of it, but it is pretty unhealthy." [...] Rowling has also noted that Malfoy [...] "is certainly stylish in the film." ...|$|E

2500|$|In sheer power, {{her high}} notes were {{sometimes}} {{compared to those}} of the Broadway belter Ethel Merman. However Nilsson claims her [...] "explosive" [...] high notes that were her biggest asset on-stage [...] "have not been recorded like they should have been" [...] in the studio. She later lamented: [...] "It always made <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> sad when I heard my own recordings. And many people told me that I sang much better in person than I do on the recordings! That didn't flatter me at all, because I know what's going to be left when I am no longer singing". Once urged to follow Nilsson in the same role at the Metropolitan Opera, the eminent soprano Leonie Rysanek refused.|$|E
2500|$|Diamond {{spent his}} early {{career as a}} {{songwriter}} in the Brill Building. His first success as a songwriter came in November 1965, with [...] "Sunday and Me", a Top 20 hit for Jay and the Americans. Greater success as a writer followed with [...] "I'm a Believer", [...] "A Little Bit <b>Me,</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Bit</b> You", [...] "Look Out (Here Comes Tomorrow)", and [...] "Love to Love", all performed by the Monkees. Diamond wrote and recorded the songs for himself, but the cover versions were released before his own. The unintended, but happy, consequence was that Diamond began to gain fame {{not only as a}} singer and performer, but also as a songwriter. [...] "I'm a Believer" [...] became a Gold Record within two days of its release, and stayed {{at the top of the}} charts for seven weeks, making it the Popular Music Song of the Year in 1966.|$|E

The {{fight was}} at light welterweight, {{which was the}} sixth weight {{category}} Pacquiao has fought at and is the weight at which Hatton was previously undefeated. Pacquiao defeated Hatton {{in the second round}} by a KO victory after knocking Hatton down twice in the first round. Following the loss to Pacquiao, Hatton put his career on hiatus. After more than a year out of action, in a June 2010 interview with Gulfnews.com, the British boxer seemed uninterested in coming to the ring again. He stated: [...] "Boxing started off as a habit and it ended up giving me some money and making <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of a better person. But I don't think I will have a fight again. But you can never say never as I have not announced officially that I won't be boxing.

2500|$|In January 2009, Jones {{appeared}} in Unforgiven, a three-part drama on ITV1, where she plays Ruth Slater, a woman {{released from prison}} after serving a 15-year prison sentence {{for the murder of}} two policemen. Naturally brown-haired, Jones dyed her hair [...] "tobacco yellow" [...] with [...] "big roots"; Jones joked that whilst not filming she [...] "really should have worn a wig". Additionally, the character of Ruth wore no make-up throughout, with Jones stating she was left feeling [...] "quite exposed", but nonetheless saying [...] "Ruth wouldn't have worn any make-up, I don't think". Jones received favourable reviews for her portrayal, with Brian Viner of The Independent writing: [...] "a stunning performance, the stuff of Bafta nominations if ever I saw it. Heck, on the back of it she might even get propelled into the movies, and bring a bit of North Country sense to the Golden Globes". Viner summarised his review of Unforgiven by stating, [...] "Five stars all round, and six for Jones". Jones later stated, [...] "I loved that role. They don't come along that often. It was seen by the broadsheets as well as the tabloids. It gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of credibility, I suppose".|$|E
2500|$|Injuries put {{holes in}} the Nationals' {{starting}} lineup in the games after they clinched the division. Right fielder Bryce Harper was injured in a September 25 game against the Pirates, jamming his thumb when Pirates third baseman Jung Ho Kang faked a tag that prompted {{him to make a}} late slide into third. Nationals manager Dusty Baker took exception to the play, and when Kang next came up to bat, Cole threw a ball behind his back and was ejected from the game, leading to a benches-clearing altercation on the field. Cole denied the pitch was intentional, saying, [...] "The ball was getting away from <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> and that one got away from me." [...] He was suspended five games over the incident and fined, a verdict which he appealed. In the following game, a rain-soaked September 26 matchup with the Arizona Diamondbacks, catcher Wilson Ramos tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee for the second time after making a leaping catch on a relay from first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, forcing him to undergo season-ending surgery. Spencer Kieboom was called up from Harrisburg to replace him on the roster. However, the team also received some bullpen reinforcements as Belisle returned from his injury layoff to pitch against the Pirates in the September 25 game while left-handed reliever Sammy Solis was activated off the disabled list on September 26 and pitched a perfect inning in a 4–2 win over the Diamondbacks the following day.|$|E
