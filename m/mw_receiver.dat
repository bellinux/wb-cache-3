40|$|The {{quality of}} {{wireless}} network depends essentially on the directional {{characteristics of the}} antennas, {{the most important of}} which are the amplitude radiation pattern (RP) and the frequency response (FR), which is understood as a change of the gain coefficient in the working frequency band. At the same time, equipment for measuring the characteristics of the antennas in real conditions is very expensive, difficult to deploy, configure and maintain. In most cases, the measurement accuracy requirements are significantly lower than in laboratory measurements. This fact allows using the equipment {{which is part of the}} wireless network itself. The aim of this work is to develop a simplified procedure for measuring the amplitude RP and frequency characteristics of antennas for the rapid assessment of electromagnetic environment during deployment of wireless networks, when the requirements for measurement accuracy are not critical. In this article we propose to use as a UHF calibrated power generator a standard Wi-Fi router with a coaxial output, i. e. with the possibility to connect an external antenna.

30|$|Sleep {{scheduling}} of WLAN APs {{is heavily}} {{affected by the}} traffic pattern. (1) In the micro time scale, duty-cycling of APs is suggested in [14] for power-efficient multi-hop extension of access networks. Packets can also be aggregated so as to use the burst transmission and high rate of 802.11 n [15], enabling a longer idle period and sleeping time. Practically, only the WLAN module can be put into sleep in the short idle period. (2) In the macro time scale, the whole system of idle APs can be put into sleep to realize green WLANs [4]. A further optimization is to aggregate flows to few APs and put more APs into sleep. But some APs still have to stay awake even in the idle state {{in order to ensure}} coverage. Several methods may be used to activate APs from sleep. An AP is composed of WLAN module, LAN module, CPU, memory, hard disk etc. A simple wake-up policy is to keep the LAN module and WLAN module awake while putting other modules into sleep, and exploit the wake-on-LAN [16] and wake-on-WLAN [17] functions for wake-up signaling. According to [3], although an idle LAN module consumes little power, an idle WLAN module still consumes significant power (on the order of 1 W) in monitoring the channel. A more energy-efficient method is to put the WLAN module into sleep as well, and use an auxiliary low-power (no more than 1 <b>mW)</b> wake-up <b>receiver</b> to trigger the wake-up event instead.

40|$|The {{development}} of wireless communication systems into multi-standard radio architectures that can process {{a multitude of}} frequency bands and modulation schemes has lead to a growing demand for wideband receiver front-ends. To allow for portability and low cost, these new architectures {{also need to be}} low power, compact size integrated circuits with a higher degree of components integrated on chip. These requirements have made the simple architecture of the Zero IF receiver especially attractive for this application. The design of a Zero IF receiver that complies both with current standards such as GSM and UMTS as well as the new standards WiMAX and LTE meet several challenges. Both the new standards take advantage of the multi carrier modulation scheme OFDM to increase spectral efficiency, which demands for higher linearity because of a non constant signal envelope. Also the frequency spectrum allocated for WiMAX/ LTE range from 900 MHz to 5. 8 GHz which is several GHz higher than current multi-standard receivers. One possible solution for a high linearity wideband Zero IF receiver is to use the recently developed common gate LNA with capacitive cross-coupling technique, together with a passive down-conversion mixer that has inherently high linearity.

This dissertation mainly {{focuses on the}} design of a 210 GHz fundamental transceiver and also covers the design of a W-band fully integrated imaging system utilizing a novel concept of spatial-overlapping super pixels. Firstly, a 210 GHz transceiver with OOK modulation in a 32 nm SOI CMOS process (fT/fmax= 250 / 320 GHz) is presented. The transmitter (TX) employs a 2 × 2 spatial combining array consisting of a double-stacked cross-coupled voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) at 210 GHz with an on-off-keying (OOK) modulator, a power amplifier (PA) driver, a novel balun-based differential power distribution network, four PAs and an on-chip 2 × 2 dipole antenna array. The non-coherent receiver (RX) utilizes a direct detection architecture consisting of an on-chip antenna, a low noise amplifier (LNA), and a power detector. The VCO generates measured - 13. 5 dBm output power; and the PA shows a measured 15 dB gain and 4. 6 dBm Psat. The LNA exhibits a measured in-band gain of 18 dB and minimum in-band noise figure (NF) of 11 dB. The TX achieves an EIRP of 5. 13 dBm at 10 dB back-off from saturated power. It achieves an estimated EIRP of 15. 2 dBm when the PAs are fully driven. This is the first demonstration of a fundamental frequency CMOS transceiver at the 200 GHz frequency range. Secondly, a W-band direct-detection-based receiver array in an advanced 0. 18 µm BiCMOS process is presented, which incorporates a new concept of spatial-overlapping super-pixels for millimeter-wave imaging applications. The use of spatial-overlapping super-pixels results in (1) improved SNR at the pixel level through a reduction of spillover losses, (2) partially correlated adjacent super-pixels, (3) a 2 × 2 window averaging function in the RF domain, (4) the ability to compensate for the systematic phase delay and amplitude variations due to the off-focal-point effect for antennas away from the focal point, and (5) the ability to compensate for mutual coupling effects among the array elements.

However, current research at San Diego State University (SDSU) Combustion and Solar Energy Laboratory (CSEL) is underway to develop a high temperature solar receiver which will utilize carbon nanoparticles as a solar absorption medium. To produce carbon nanoparticles for the small particle heat exchange receiver (SPHER), a lab-scale carbon particle generator (CPG) has been built and tested. The CPG is a heated ceramic tube reactor with a set point wall temperature of 1100 - 1300 ??C operating at 5 - 6 bar pressure. Natural gas and nitrogen are fed to the CPG where natural gas undergoes pyrolysis resulting in carbon particles. The gas-particle mixture is met downstream with dilution air {{and sent to the}} lab scale solar receiver. To predict soot yield and general trends in CPG performance, a model has been setup in Reaction Design CHEMKIN-PRO software. One of the primary goals of this research is to accurately measure particle properties. Mean particle diameter, size distribution, and index of refraction are calculated using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and a Diesel Particulate Scatterometer (DPS). Filter samples taken during experimentation are analyzed to obtain a particle size distribution with SEM images processed in ImageJ software. These results are compared with the DPS, which calculates the particle size distribution and the index of refraction from light scattering using Mie theory. For testing with the lab scale receiver, a particle diameter range of 200 - 500 nm is desired. Test conditions are varied to understand effects of operating parameters on particle size and the ability to obtain the size range. Analysis of particle loading is the other important metric for this research. Particle loading is measured downstream of the CPG outlet and dilution air mixing point. The airparticle mixture flows through an extinction tube where opacity of the mixture is measured with a 532 nm laser and detector. Beer's law is then used to calculate particle loading. The CPG needs to produce a certain particle loading for a corresponding receiver test. By obtaining the particle loading in the system, the reaction conversion to solid carbon in the CPG can be calculated to measure the efficiency of the CPG. To predict trends in reaction conversion and particle size from experimentation, the CHEMKIN-PRO computer model for the CPG is run for various flow rates and wall temperature profiles. These predictions were a reason for testing at higher wall set point temperatures. Based on these research goals, it was shown that the CPG consistently produces a mean particle diameter of 200 - 400 nm at the conditions tested, fitting perfectly inside the desired range. This led to successful lab scale SPHER testing which produced a 10 -point efficiency increase and 150 ??C temperature difference with particles present. Also, at 3 g/s dilution air flow rate, an efficiency of 80 % at an outlet temperature above 800 ??C was obtained. Promise was shown at higher CPG experimental temperatures to produce higher reaction conversion, both experimentally and in the model. However, based on wall temperature data taken during experimentation, it is apparent that the CPG needs to have multiple heating zones with separate temperature controllers in order to have an isothermal zone rather than a parabolic temperature profile. As for the computer model, it predicted much higher reaction conversion at higher temperature. The mass fraction of fuel in the inlet stream was shown to not affect conversion while increasing residence time led to increasing conversion. Particle size distribution in the model was far off and showed a bimodal distribution for one of the statistical methods. Using the results from experimentation and modeling, a preliminary CPG design is presented that will operate in a 5 <b>MW</b> th <b>receiver</b> system...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advance in}} {{wireless}} technologies has enabled {{rapid growth of}} mobile devices. Consequently, emerging applications for mobile devices have begun demanding data rates up to multiple Gb/s. Although advanced WiFi systems are approaching such data rates, the narrow bandwidth at ISM band fundamentally limits the achievable data-rate. Therefore, the unlicensed 7 GHz of bandwidth at 60 GHz band provides an opportunity to efficiently implement these communication systems with a potential to achieve > 10 Gb/s throughput. Besides the wider bandwidth, operating at higher frequency theoretically has higher achievable signal-to-noise ratio in area limited applications. This is because the maximum achievable antenna gain within limited aperture increases with frequency {{and it can be}} achieved using phased-array technique. This thesis therefore focuses on the design of 60 GHz phased-array transceivers to support energy-efficient high data-rate communication systems. Despite the advantages of 60 GHz, mobile applications often require low power consumption as well as low cost implementation, making the design of 60 GHz phased-array systems challenging. Taking into account the limited power budget, this research investigates the design choices of the number of elements in phased-array transceivers, and identifies that the overhead power is the bottleneck of energy efficiency. In order to reduce the overhead power in the transmitter, a new architecture using a fast start-up oscillator is proposed, which eliminates the need of explicit modulator and 60 GHz LO delivery. Measurements has shown that the transmitter efficiency is boosted by more than 2 X. More importantly, the overhead power is significantly reduced down to 2 mW, making this architecture a good candidate for large number phased-array. On the other hand, suffering from the similar overhead problem, the receiver unfortunately could not share the same architecture. A different architecture that stacks the mixer on top of LO generation is thus proposed to reduce the power consumption in the receiver. This approach demonstrated a 2 X power reduction in receiver overhead, and the resulted optimum number of receiver elements is close to 4. Besides using CMOS technologies, on-chip antenna is also studied in order to further reduce the system cost. Slot-loop antenna is identified as a good candidate because that its intrinsic ground plane eases the integration with the rest of circuitry. Although the simulation shows an efficiency as high as 30 %, the planar nature of the on-chip antenna limits its coverage in end-fire directions. Antenna diversity is thus proposed to overcome this limitation by utilizing multiple drive points on the same antenna. Because the antenna is fully integrated on-chip, antenna diversity can be implemented without extra high frequency I/Os, eliminating the loss that would be introduced otherwise. Using the proposed transceiver architectures, a 4 -element phased-array with on-chip antennas was fabricated on TSMC's 65 nm CMOS technology as a test vehicle. Consuming 50 mW in the transmitter and 65 <b>mW</b> in the <b>receiver,</b> this 10. 4 Gb/s phased-array covers a range larger than 45 cm in all directions. This achieves a state-of-art energy-efficiency of 11 pJ/bit. The 29 mW/element power consumption also demonstrates the lowest power of a single phased-array element...|$|R
