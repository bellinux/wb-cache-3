[...] The guitar was tuned down one-half step, with the tone controls set to resemble a bass guitar.|$|E
500|$|Returning to Britain {{to receive}} his medal from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 22 June 1915, O'Leary {{was given a}} grand {{reception}} attended by thousands of Londoners in Hyde Park on 10 July. He was also {{the subject of much}} patriotic writing, including a poem in the Daily Mail and the short play O'Flaherty V.C. by George Bernard Shaw. Tributes came from numerous prominent figures of the day, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who said that [...] "No writer in fiction would dare to fasten such an achievement on any of his characters, but the Irish have always had a reputation of being wonderful fighters, and Lance-Corporal Michael O’Leary is clearly one of them." [...] and Thomas Scanlan who said: [...] "I heard early this week of the great achievements of the Irish Guards. All Ireland is proud of O’Leary. He fully deserves the high honour that has been conferred upon him. Ireland is grateful to him." [...] His reception was repeated in Macroom when he visited Ireland, with crowds turning out to applaud him. Daniel O'Leary was interviewed in a local newspaper regarding his son's exploit but was reportedly unimpressed, commenting: [...] "I am surprised he didn't do more. I often laid out twenty men <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stick coming from Macroom Fair, and it is a bad trial of Mick that he could kill only eight, and he having a rifle and bayonet." ...|$|E

I find <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heightened colour perception and an appreciation of beauty almost destroyed by my years of depressions." [...] Most AAs were strongly opposed to his experimenting with a mind-altering substance.|$|E
5000|$|I will {{maintain}} {{an attitude of}} good will. I will not preoccupy <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> enemy ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Stop that foolery, you idiot," [...] I {{muttered to}} Stephen, kicking {{him on the}} shins, [...] "or you'll get our throats cut." [...] Then, {{collecting}} <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> effort, I said: ...|$|R
2500|$|Early {{studies of}} alcoholics who {{underwent}} LSD treatment reported a 50% success rate after a single high-dose session. However, {{the studies that}} reported high success rates had insufficient controls, lacked objective measures of genuine change, and failed to conduct rigorous follow-up interviews with subjects. The lack of conclusive evidence notwithstanding, individual case reports are often dramatic. Bill Wilson, the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous conducted medically supervised experiments in the 1950s {{on the effects of}} LSD on alcoholism. Bill is quoted as saying [...] "It is a generally acknowledged fact in spiritual development that ego reduction makes the influx of God's grace possible. If, therefore, under LSD we can have a temporary reduction, so that we can better see what we are and where we are going—well, that might be of some help. The goal might become clearer. So I consider LSD to be of some value to some people, and practically no damage to anyone. It will never take the place of any of the existing means by which we can reduce the ego, and keep it reduced." [...] Wilson felt that regular usage of LSD in a carefully controlled, structured setting would be beneficial for many recovering alcoholics. However, he felt this method only should be attempted by individuals with well-developed super-egos. In 1957 Wilson wrote a letter to Heard saying: [...] "I am certain that the LSD experiment has helped me very much. I find <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heightened colour perception and an appreciation of beauty almost destroyed by my years of depressions." [...] Most AA members were strongly opposed to his experimenting with a mind-altering substance.|$|E
60|$|I have {{received}} your letter of yesterday's date, and shall content <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> brief reply.|$|E
60|$|Canaples was livid with passion, but {{otherwise}} the calmest in that room, saving perhaps <b>myself.</b> <b>With</b> <b>a</b> gesture he restrained Montmédy and St. Auban.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Carvel, {{your very}} obedient. Hereafter I shall {{know better than}} to forget <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> overseer." [...] And he gave me his back. [...] "What say you to a game of billiards, Philip?" ...|$|R
60|$|I was pausing {{again and}} trying to invest <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> air of further interest, when another man was {{introduced}} to her, quite evidently, from his appearance, a vapid jackass without one tenth of the brain calibre that I have.|$|R
60|$|I drank {{a cup of}} Armagnac, cheered <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> oath or two, {{and again}} I called Michelot. When he came, I {{asked him if he}} were acquainted with M. de Canaples, to which he replied that he was, having seen the gentleman in my company.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{supposed}} {{that we should}} come to that, Master Oswald, for otherwise {{you would not have}} told me to provide <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> staff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It ruined them, unfortunately. They {{were never}} any use again. For {{the rest of}} the trip I had to {{manicure}} <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hunting-spear." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{felt that}} still Mrs. Fursey didn't understand. But I foresaw that further {{explanation}} would only shock her, so contented <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> simple, matter-of-fact question.|$|E
60|$|Later on I busied <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{inspection}} of the hut, and my first attentions were for the miraculous image. I looked upon it with awe, and I knelt to it in prayer for forgiveness for the unworthiness I brought {{to the service of}} the shrine.|$|R
60|$|Nicholas Naranovitsch was {{transferred}} to the staff of General Skobeleff. Petroff was sent to act the part of guide and scout to the division, and I, although anxious to obtain employment at the front, was obliged to content <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> appointment to the army hospitals at Sistova.|$|R
60|$|Again {{there was}} silence. Mabane had {{withdrawn}} his pipe from his mouth, {{and was looking}} steadfastly into the bowl. As for me, I found it wholly impossible to analyse my sensations. All the time Arthur was looking eagerly {{from one to the}} other of us. I recovered <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> effort, and answered him.|$|R
6000|$|Oh, my friend, {{the agony}} in that {{shrouded}} face was ecstasy to see! I {{thought of a}} new torture, and applied it--assisting <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> trifle of lying invention-- ...|$|E
60|$|So I had to wipe <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{newspaper}} which I {{happened to}} have in my pocket, and a more unsatisfactory thing to dry oneself upon I cannot conceive.|$|E
60|$|At a hint {{from the}} {{solicitor}} I contented <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more definite promise {{to do me}} justice. Then {{as we left the}} office, Martin Lorimer turned to the editor.|$|E
60|$|On the {{occasion}} of my second reception by the Princess, at her little evening party, I detected the Baroness, more than once, {{in the act of}} watching her Highness and <b>myself,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> appearance of disapproval in her manner, which puzzled me. When I had taken my leave, she followed me out of the room.|$|R
6000|$|There! Go {{and do it}} if you can. I {{admit that}} I can't. I {{have no idea what}} the French phrase above means, but I know that {{personally}} I cannot [...] "invest <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> atmosphere of interest." [...] I might manage about two per cent on five hundred dollars. But what is that in these days of plutocracy? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{sincerely}} think so, Lord Pledge, or I {{should not}} have said it. I am peculiarly situated <b>myself.</b> <b>With</b> <b>an</b> immense fortune, without rank, name, or connections, nothing is easier than for one of my years to be led astray; {{and it is my}} ardent desire to hit upon some expedient that may connect me properly with society." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{voice of}} my {{companion}} {{brought me back}} to <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> laugh. I too had been groping and floundering, the while I thought I rode clear-eyed through the mystery.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he might," [...] said Fred; [...] "or {{take you}} on the head--which wouldn't be so pleasant. I'm not particular--but I'd better run my chance <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> chap that fired low." ...|$|E
60|$|Here I stop <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strong rein. It is fatal, dear Mr. Ruskin, {{to write}} letters on New Year's day. One can't help moralising; one falls on the metaphysical vein unaware.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{seeing that}} the commandant was utterly uncompromising, Marais went up to his nephew and whispered {{to him for a}} while. What he said I do not know. The result of it was, however, that after favouring both Retief and <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> angry scowl, Pereira turned and walked to where his horse stood, mounted it, and rode off, {{followed}} by two Hottentot after-riders.|$|R
6000|$|... "Feeling no {{disposition}} to reply to him, I contented <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> inward speculation on the differences which {{exist in the}} constitution of men's minds. I {{do not know what}} inference Mr. Crimsworth drew from my silence--whether he considered it a symptom of contumacity or an evidence of my being cowed by his peremptory manner. After a long and hard stare at me, he rose sharply from his seat.|$|R
6000|$|MARMADUKE [...] No--it cannot be-- [...] I {{dare not}} trust <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> such <b>a</b> thought-- [...] Yet whence this strange aversion? You are a man [...] Not used to rash conjectures-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Another {{shock to}} his mind might be fatal to him. I can use what I believe to be a justifiable fraud to prevent his marrying again; but I cannot burden <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> crime." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{scream of}} delight from Suzanne {{followed}} this sally, which was received by Gaspard and Hippolyte with a rattle of sacres, and--despite our irritation--the Colonel, Monsieur Gratiot, and <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> burst of involuntary laughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "This morning, I rose, {{planning}} to amuse <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new narrative, when the ideal {{world in which}} I am now living, became a world annihilated by collision with the sordid interests of real life.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is true," [...] I said to <b>myself,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> inward laugh, [...] "I carry no glove or {{delicate}} handkerchief bound upon my visor--" [...] but at {{this point}} my mind wandered. I went more slowly, and at last I stopped and sat down under the shade of a way-side tree. I thought for a few minutes, and then I said to myself, [...] "It seems to me {{this would be a good}} time to take one of those capsules," [...] and I took one. I then fancied that perhaps I ought to take two, but I contented <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> one.|$|R
6000|$|Well, my {{butterfly}} was resting, poised like a statue, on {{a pretty}} flowering plant {{that grew out}} of a cranny in the sheer wall of rock, a yard or two below the precise point where I was then sitting. Said I to <b>myself,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> eager dart forward, [...] "I shall nab that specimen;" [...] and laying aside my pencil and drawing-pad at once, I proceeded forthwith, {{at the top of my}} speed, incontinently to nab him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{pretend to}} compare <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> such <b>a</b> woman; but I {{should have no}} more right to give up," [...] she answered, {{helpless}} against the logic of her fate, which he had somehow divined.|$|R
