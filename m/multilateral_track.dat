40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to prove the {{progress}} of the Eastern Partnership despite the unsettled economic and political situation in most of participating countries by means of a closer look at the bilateral and multilateral economic cooperation between EU and the partners and by emphasizing the main guidelines and potential of the implemented projects in the sphere of economic integration and convergence with EU policies. The first chapter introduces the Eastern initiative by explaining its premises, thematic platforms and the main purposes of the bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> <b>track.</b> It also introduces the profile of the partner states, depicting therefore the international context of the Partnership. The second chapter offers a detailed look at the fundamental level of the Eastern Partnership. It embodies two sub-chapters corresponding with the bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> <b>track.</b> The third chapter represents a general view of the project implementation in connection with existing challenges and offers a set of recommendations which would increase the EaP's performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} {{basically}} {{concerned with the}} multilateral diplomacies in the Middle East conflict {{in general and the}} Madrid Conference 1991 in particular. It focuses on the Madrid format i. e. the ceremony, the Bilateral <b>tracks,</b> and the <b>Multilateral</b> <b>tracks.</b> As for the ceremony, it addresses the impact of the Gulf War II on convening the Madrid Conference and James Baker's shuttle diplomacy. The Bilateral tracks illustrate the Israeli negotiation process with joint Jordanian-Palestinian, Syrian, and Lebanese delegations. The <b>Multilateral</b> <b>tracks</b> touch cross border issues, namely arms control, economic cooperation, water, refugees and environment. It also compares the multilateral diplomacies in the Middle East conflict with important examples of the same kind of diplomacy in the past, notably at Westphalia (1648), Vienna (1815), Versailles (1919) and San Francisco (1945) ...|$|R

50|$|As a {{first step}} Bush {{announced}} his intention to reconvene the international peace conference in Madrid. The Bush administration believed there was {{a window of opportunity}} to use the political capital generated by the U.S. victory in the Gulf War to revitalize the Arab-Israeli peace process. This peace initiative focused on convening a multi-party international conference that would then break into separate, bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> negotiating <b>tracks.</b> U.S. Secretary of State James Baker made eight diplomatic visits to the region to get support for the conference. A framework of objectives was formulated and the U.S., together with the Soviet Union, extended a letter of invitation, dated 30 October 1991 to Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Palestinians.|$|R
40|$|Joel Peters {{focuses on}} the failed peace-making {{practices}} of the Middle East <b>multilateral</b> <b>track</b> process launched at Madrid in 1991. He thus uses the dynamics within Arab-Israeli relations to inform {{an assessment of the}} Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. Peters shows that conflicts of interests and rivalries among the participating parties emerged as soon as the multilateral peace talks moved from the discussion of ideas to the stage where decisions on the actual implementation of cooperation projects had to be reached. Thus, the demise of the multilateral talks and the subsequent slowdown in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process were underway before the launching of the EMP. The failure of developing peace-making practices within the multilateral Arab-Israeli peace talks inevitably spilled over to the EMP from the outset...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{crucible}} in {{this scenario}} for the international climate regime {{is the emergence of}} an effective and liquid international carbon market with participation of private entities. In order to make the carbon market effective a bilateral negoti-ation track will develop, operating in parallel with the <b>multilateral</b> <b>track</b> under the UNFCCC. The purpose of the bilateral track is to integrate the various emissions trading schemes involving private actors. This bilateral track feeds into the UNFCCC negotiations, which still represents the main arena for the international climate negotiations. Through the bilateral, bottom-up negotiations, a multistage system develops, with differentiated rights and duties, complemented by a package of coordinated support mechanisms. The advantages of such a bottom-up approach prove to be, inter alia, fewer negotiating parties, new negotiation arenas, and a new set of selective incentives. The result is a continuously evolving agreement with the potential to gradually broaden participation and deepen the reduction commitments of the international climate regime. Moreover, the bilateral agreements for linking schemes with private actors also represent a fallback {{in the event of a}} collapse in the multilateral negotiations...|$|E
40|$|Many {{scholars}} now {{argue that}} the Treaty of Lisbon has removed the role and influence of the rotating Council Presidency {{in the domain of}} the European Union’s foreign affairs. This paper will, however, go beyond a superficial, treaty-based analysis of the influence of the post-Lisbon rotating Council Presidency and instead look at two primary, residual, informal Presidential roles, namely agenda-shaping and brokering. It will examine {{the extent to which these}} informal roles allowed the Polish and Lithuanian Council Presidencies of July to December 2011 and 2013 respectively to influence the development of the bilateral, <b>multilateral</b> and internal <b>tracks</b> of the Eastern Partnership.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{narrative of}} the diplomatic exchanges {{that occurred during the}} Libyan war. Some crises flare up and are forgotten fairly quickly. Others offer lasting insights into the global balance of power and the state of international diplomacy. The Libyan crisis falls into the second category. In a period in which serious commentators dwell on “the decline of the West” and “the erosion of the post-Cold War order”, the war has been both a test of Western military might and international cooperation. In March 2011, with the Libyan war gathering pace, the Center on International Cooperation [CIC] at New York University asked Emily O’Brien and Andrew Sinclair to <b>track</b> <b>multilateral</b> efforts to manage the crisis. The result is this detailed narrative of diplomatic negotiations across international and regional organizations ranging from the United Nations, NATO and the EU to the African Union, League of Arab States and Organization of the Islamic Conference. The narrative runs from the first international responses to the uprising in Libya in February to the eve of the rebel assault on Tripoli {{in the second half of}} August...|$|R
40|$|Research {{into the}} effects of ability {{grouping}} has usually been conducted within schools. In the British and North American context, where the bulk {{of this kind of}} research has been carried out, ability grouping commonly occurs within schools. In Flanders – the Dutch-speaking, northern part of Belgium – as in other European countries, there are not only tracks within schools, but schools themselves can be distinguished by the curriculum they offer. This study questions whether students’ global self-esteem is affected differently by processes of within-school <b>tracking</b> (<b>multilateral</b> schools) compared to processes of between-school tracking (categorial schools). Analyses are based on a subsample of the Flemish Educational Assessment, gathered in 2004 – 2005, encompassing 10 multilateral and 56 categorial schools with 3, 758 academic and 2, 152 vocational students. Multi-level analyses (HLM 6) show that academic students have a significant higher self-esteem than vocational students and this difference is larger in multilateral schools. Academic students in multilateral schools have a slightly higher self-esteem than those in categorial schools. Conceivably, academic students compare themselves with the vocational track students, leading to a higher awareness of status gratification, resulting in a higher self-esteem...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{achievements}} of Middle East environmental diplomacy under the <b>multilateral</b> <b>track</b> and lays out a feasible program to build on these achievements. It argues that negotiations should be informed by three lessons {{from the history of}} international water diplomacy. These are: 1) unequal partners may unequally share {{the costs and benefits of}} cooperation; 2) third-party mediation is most successful if accompanied by “carrot and stick” policies; and 3) cooperation should proceed as a series of modest steps, rather than as a grand regional plan. The paper analyzes three issues in urgent need of multicountry cooperation. These are: 1) food for water trades to enhance food and water security in the region; 2) a transition to integrated pest management to halt the pollution of groundwater from agricultural runoff; and 3) the treatment and reuse of urban wastewater for health and water conservation. In addition, the countries of the region should, jointly and individually, invest in environmental training and outreach. The conclusion contains an itemized list of short-to-intermediate term recommendations for environmental diplomacy...|$|E
40|$|One {{aftermath}} of the Madrid Peace Conference was establishment of a <b>multilateral</b> <b>track</b> (the “multilaterals”) by the United States designed to address issues of region-wide concern, such as arms control and regional security, economic development, water, the environment, and refugees. For {{the first time since}} Israel’s creation, Israel and Arab states gathered together specifically to address regional issues of mutual concern, marking a major turning point {{in the history of the}} Arab-Israeli conflict. Despite problems, the multilaterals produced joint projects and unprecedented regional economic conferences, and the first regional Arab-Israeli institutions. Among the most significant of these institutions is the Bank for Economic Cooperation and Development in the Middle East and North Africa, or the MENABANK. The MENABANK was primarily created to serve the political objectives of the peace process, creating cooperative outlets for Arab-Israeli interaction that would establish a favorable regional climate for peacemaking. This paper uses the MENABANK case to explore the sources of new regional institutions and to illustrate larger lessons about the forces supporting and impeding regional multilateral cooperation. Conceptually, international relations scholarship has begun to recognize the need to focus on the question of regional orders which, outside the European context, have been greatly ignored. The question of building regional institutions as part of these orders is particularly important, especially because such institutions can help facilitate more stable relations if constructed properly. But institution building, like any political process, is a contentious exercise that deserves careful study, a point well illustrated by the MENABANK...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{looks into}} {{whether and how}} Georgian NGOs have made use ofthe opportunities available to them within the developing relations between the EU and Georgia. This qualitative in-depth case study based research focusing on Georgia is set within the theoretical fields of external europeanization and democracy assistance. It aims to uncover how networks emerge that transcend the international-domestic divide and how Georgian NGOs have participated in these networks. Since the 2004 big bang enlargement, when 10 new states acceded, the EU has been continuously confronted with popular protests against authoritarian regimes in its neighbourhood. Both the wave of colour revolutions in the Eastern neighbourhood and {{the events of the}} Arab Spring caught the EU by surprise. The EU failed to respond to the demand for increased EU support from within the neighbourhood and was overtaken by these events. While the EU introduced specific policies for the neighbouring countries {{in the form of the}} European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the Eastern Partnership (EaP), these appeared to only have had limited impact on democratization. Generally, critics regarded this as proof that the EU was unable to formulate and implement a coherent external policy and that it still relied on its conditionality-based tools in order to support democratization outside its borders. This research analyzes the usefulness ofthe ENP and EaP as democracy assistance policies through a different framework in order to uncover other mechanisms through which the EU may facilitate democracy assistance in its neighbourhood. The theoretical foundation of this research consists of two fields of thinking: democracy assistance and external europeanization. From the first field, this research borrows the view that successful international democracy assistance focuses on creating favourable circumstances for NGOs to work in and on fostering links between NGOs and the state. The second field looks to howthe EU influences countries outside its borders and how this affects the policies and politics of third countries. While the direct democracy assistance programmes of the EU may be largely ineffective, the ENP and EaP introduce potential forms of engagement for non-state actors. By doing so, these policies create opportunities for interaction between different actors, including NGOs, which is a form of back door democracy assistance, identified as a network governance model of democracy assistance in this research. In this form of democracy assistance, NGOs are not considered as targets of democracy assistance programmes, but as actors that make use of the pressure for adaption caused by the rhetorical support for democratization within the ENP/EaP agenda. This agenda mayoffer NGOs different types of resources, leading to different forms of empowerment. In order to test these theoretical assumptions, this research looks to the single case of post-Rose Revolution Georgia. The case ofGeorgia combines three elements that are crucial if the proposed theoryis to be upheld: institutionalization of relations between the EU and Georgia in the framework of the ENP/EaP, a rhetorical commitment to European integration and democratization by the Georgian government and the existence of a vibrant NGO scene in Georgia. Through qualitative research,including more than 70 interviews, this research looks into whether Georgian NGOs perceived the ENP/EaP as an opportunity to strengthen their own agenda, substantiating three main findings. First, this research considers whether the ENP and EaP have indeed entailed a new form of governance that would allow for a network governance model of democracy assistance. The ENP turned out to borrow heavily from the earlier experience of enlargement, continuing to build on traditional forms of bilateral relations and failing to export the EUs model of governance outside its borders. Despite the stress on the importance of democratization there was no room for institutionalized inclusion of non-state actorssuch as NGOs. The ENP can be considered a form of external europeanization using mainly conditionality-based tools, failing to create a form ofnetwork mode of governance. The EaPs <b>multilateral</b> <b>track</b> introduced horizontal governance structures into the EUs relations with its Eastern neighbours. Several institutions, such as the Civil Society Forum (CSF), have been created that allow for the involvement of non-state actors. Incontrast to the ENP the EaP did succeed in initiating a network mode ofgovernance within its external relations. However, this remains limitedas bilateral relations continue to play a more determinant role in the EaP compared to advisory bodies such as the CSF. Although the EU claimedthat the ENP was to introduce novel forms of governance, the creation of the EaPs CSF signalled the first actual step in this direction. This shows how there is a disparity between the EUs ambition in this field and the realization of this aspiration. Second, the question is whether Georgian NGOs perceive the ENP/EaP as an opportunity. Under the ENP there was a lack of institutional embeddedness which hampered the effectiveness of the activities of NGOs within the ENP. The EU from its sidehad no clear commitment towards civil society inclusion and the initiatives that were started by Georgian NGOs failed to connect with the ENPsinstitutions. In contrast to the ENP, the EaP offers NGOs institutionalembeddedness, opening up a network mode of governance assistance in stead of the sole use of an unintended back door form, as was the case inthe ENP. As a result, Georgian NGOs have made use of the opportunities within the EaP in a different way than under the ENP. Although the extrafunding and their inclusion into the CSF strengthened their position, the fact that NGOs remained outside the bilateral track restricted their opportunities. Third, the EaP has indeed contributed to thedevelopment towards a network mode of governance democracy assistance. The introduction of the CSF and the associated National Platform (NP), together with a more coordinated and focused approach towards direct civil society assistance from the part of the EU, have resulted in the creation of an international and domestic network of NGOs and in closer and more direct ties between EU institutions and NGOs. This is the result of the incremental progress made by the EU towards realizing its goal of a novel way of setting up relations with partners from the countries from the EaP and of creating a partnership with society. However, members of the NP still consider their role and input in the overall EaP-framework to be limited, especially when looking to the impact of NGOs on other political actors such as the government. This last finding indicates that the domestic context is still the dominant factor when assessing the effectiveness of this network mode of governance democracy assistance.
