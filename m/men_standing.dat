5|$|As Pettigrew's North Carolina Brigade came on line, they flanked the 19th Indiana {{and drove}} the Iron Brigade back. The 26th North Carolina (the largest {{regiment}} in the army with 839 men) lost heavily, leaving the first day's fight with around 212 men. By {{the end of the}} three-day battle, they had about 152 <b>men</b> <b>standing,</b> the highest casualty percentage for one battle of any regiment, North or South. Slowly the Iron Brigade was pushed out of the woods toward Seminary Ridge. Hill added Maj. Gen. William Dorsey Pender's division to the assault, and the I Corps was driven back through the grounds of the Lutheran Seminary and Gettysburg streets.|$|E
5|$|Casualties were {{severe that}} afternoon. The 26th North Carolina (the largest {{regiment}} {{of the army}} with 839 men) lost heavily, leaving the first day's fight with around 212 men. Their commander, Colonel Henry K. Burgwyn, was fatally wounded by a bullet through his chest. By {{the end of the}} three-day battle, they had about 152 <b>men</b> <b>standing,</b> the highest casualty percentage for one battle of any regiment, North or South. One of the Union regiments, the 24th Michigan, lost 399 of 496. It had nine color bearers shot down, and its commander, Col. Henry A. Morrow, was wounded in the head and captured. The 151st Pennsylvania of Biddle's brigade lost 337 of 467.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days after}} Kennedy was assassinated, the Associated Press in Dallas {{reported}} that Altgens' first photograph along Elm Street had {{captured the attention}} of people who noticed that one of the <b>men</b> <b>standing</b> in the main doorway to the book depository appeared to resemble the accused killer Lee Harvey Oswald. Those observers raised the question of whether Oswald could have killed Kennedy, saying he {{would not have been able}} to get to the doorway from the sixth floor of the building. The report quoted depository superintendent Roy Truly, who identified fellow employee Billy Lovelady as the man in the image. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) told the AP they had already investigated the photograph and also identified Lovelady.|$|E
50|$|The one-hour family comedy block {{returned}} for the 2013-14 season, with sophomore series The Neighbors joining Last <b>Man</b> <b>Standing,</b> where the former floundered. Another freshman comedy, Cristela (a starring vehicle for co-creator Cristela Alonzo), joined Last <b>Man</b> <b>Standing</b> on Fridays for the 2014-15 season; yet another sitcom, Dr. Ken (a star vehicle for former doctor turned stand-up comic Ken Jeong), will join Last <b>Man</b> <b>Standing</b> {{on the block}} in 2015-16. Both Dr. Ken and Last <b>Man</b> <b>Standing</b> were renewed for 2016-17. Due partly to the continued strength of Shark Tank and 20/20 (and to a somewhat lesser degree, Last <b>Man</b> <b>Standing),</b> ABC has become a challenger for CBS' usual dominance on Friday nights since the 2012-13 season. Both Dr. Ken and Last <b>Man</b> <b>Standing</b> were canceled in May 2017.|$|R

For every five-cun layer of earth, two <b>men,</b> <b>standing</b> face to face, should tamp six times with pestles, each man {{pounding}} three times on a dent; then tamp four times on each dent, two men again standing face to face, each pounding twice on the same dent; then tamp two more times, each man pounding once. Following this, tamp the surface with pestles or stamp with feet randomly to even out the surface. Every five-cun layer of earth should be compressed to three cun; every three-cun layer of brick and stone to one and a half cun.|$|E
5|$|In reserve, Farnese {{deployed}} a large battalion {{made up by}} the German regiments of Hannibal d'Altemps and Georg von Frundsberg, flanked on {{its right}} by troops of reiters under Duke Francis of Saxe-Lauenburg, elder brother of Duke Maurice, John Casimir's former lieutenant, and on its left by lancers under Pierre de Taxis. The remaining Spanish cavalry, led by Ottavio Gonzaga, covered the rear. Farnese led his troops personally, and before the battle was started, he scouted the Dutch position, having ordered his troops not to move until his return. On the Dutch side, while De la Noue and Norreys directed the <b>men</b> <b>standing</b> in Borgerhout, William of Orange witnessed the battle from the walls of Antwerp in company of archduke Matthias, brother of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, whom the States General had elected as Governor of the Netherlands {{in opposition to the}} deceased John of Austria.|$|E
5|$|On the left, on {{the other}} hand, Count William Louis of Nassau {{advanced}} with the remaining Dutch cavalry but was halted by the musketry fire of the 200 <b>men</b> <b>standing</b> on the advanced ditch. Aiming to disrupt the Dutch right, Verdugo then charged ahead of Frate's Albanian company and that of Baron de Bievres. The Dutch horse, disorganized by the musketry fire, could not resist Verdugo's rush and turned back, breaking the order, in turn, of the English foot standing behind. To capitalize on this success, Verdugo ordered his foot to follow up the victory. Unaware of the Spanish success {{on the other}} side of the field, the English infantry continued pressing back the Spanish right flank until they reached the Spanish camp. When they realized what had happened, however, the Englishmen turned back in a vain attempt to escape. The Spanish centre and left were blocking the way, and thus the English attempted to save themselves fleeing across the bogged ditches, only to be killed in large numbers.|$|E

25|$|The police offered Erickson a plea deal in {{exchange}} for testimony against Ferguson at his trial, {{which took place in}} 2005. Along with Erickson, Jerry Trump, a janitor at the Tribune, testified that he saw Erickson and Ferguson at the scene. Trump testified that while he was in jail on unrelated charges, his wife sent him a news article about the crime. He claims that as he removed the newspaper from the envelope, he saw photos of Erickson and Ferguson and immediately recognized them as the two <b>men</b> <b>standing</b> over Heithold on the evening of the murder.|$|E
25|$|The Confederates withdrew back to {{the safety}} of the hills south of town. Stonewall Jackson {{considered}} mounting a resumed counterattack, but the Federal artillery and impending darkness changed his mind. A fortuitous Union breakthrough had been wasted because Franklin did not reinforce Meade's success with some of the 20,000 <b>men</b> <b>standing</b> in reserve. Neither Franklin nor Reynolds took any personal involvement in the battle, and were unavailable to their subordinates at the critical point. Franklin's losses were about 5,000 casualties in comparison to Stonewall Jackson's 3,400, demonstrating the ferocity of the fighting. Skirmishing and artillery duels continued until dark, but no additional major attacks took place, while the center of the battle moved north to Marye's Heights. Brig. Gen George D. Bayard, who commanded a cavalry brigade in the VI Corps, was struck in the leg by a shell fragment and died two days later.|$|E

500|$|There {{were rumors}} that the nearby black town of Boley was {{organizing}} an attack on Okemah. Okemah's {{women and children were}} sent {{to spend the night in}} a nearby field, with the <b>men</b> <b>standing</b> guard on Main Street. Oswald Garrison Villard of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), wrote in protest to Lee Cruce, governor of Oklahoma. Cruce assured Villard he would do everything he could to bring the killers to justice. He defended the laws of Oklahoma as [...] "adequate" [...] and its [...] "juries competent", and said the administration of justice in the state proceeded with little cause for criticism, [...] "except in cases of extreme passion, which no law and no civilization can control". He added: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} day, {{the carrier}} [...] was badly damaged by several bomb hits and a kamikaze. Alaska {{and her sister}} , two other cruisers, and several destroyers were detached to create Task Group 58.2.9 to escort the crippled Franklin back to Ulithi. On the voyage back to port, another D4Y bomber attacked Franklin, though the ships were unable to shoot it down. Gunfire {{from one of the}} 5-inch guns accidentally caused flash burns on several <b>men</b> <b>standing</b> nearby; these were the only casualties suffered by her crew during the war. Alaska then took on the role of fighter director; using her air search radar she vectored fighters to intercept and destroy a Kawasaki Ki-45 heavy fighter. On 22 March, the ships reached Ulithi and Alaska was detached to rejoin TG 58.4.|$|E
500|$|Construction {{proceeded}} at a snail's {{pace and}} the ship was finally commissioned on 4 July 1958, although she did not enter service until 1959.

She accidentally collided with the ex-Italian torpedo boat Biokovo in 1963, damaging the latter so badly that she was immediately struck from the Navy List.

500|$|In the west, the Union {{troops had}} fallen {{back to the}} Seminary and built hasty breastworks running [...] north-south before the western face of Schmucker Hall, bolstered by 20 guns of Wainwright's battalion. Dorsey Pender's {{division}} of Hill's Corps stepped through the exhausted lines of Heth's men at about 4:00 p.m. to finish off the I Corps survivors. The brigade of Brig. Gen. Alfred M. Scales attacked first, on the northern flank. His five regiments of 1,400 North Carolinians were virtually annihilated {{in one of the}} fiercest artillery barrages of the war, rivaling Pickett's Charge to come, but on a more concentrated scale. Twenty guns spaced only [...] apart fired spherical case, explosive shells, canister, and double canister rounds into the approaching brigade, which emerged from the fight with only 500 <b>men</b> <b>standing</b> and a single lieutenant in command. Scales wrote afterwards that he found [...] "only a squad here and there marked the place where regiments had rested." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2012, New York artist Sophia Wallace {{started work}} on a {{multimedia}} project to challenge misconceptions about the clitoris. Based on O'Connell's 1998 research, Wallace's work emphasizes the sheer scope {{and size of the}} human clitoris. She says that ignorance of this still seems to be pervasive in modern society. [...] "It is a curious dilemma to observe the paradox that on the one hand the female body is the primary metaphor for sexuality, its use saturates advertising, art and the mainstream erotic imaginary," [...] she said. [...] "Yet, the clitoris, the true female sexual organ, is virtually invisible." [...] The project is called Cliteracy and it includes a [...] "clit rodeo", which is an interactive, climb-on model of a giant golden clitoris, including its inner parts, produced with the help of sculptor Kenneth Thomas. [...] "It's been a showstopper wherever it's been shown. People are hungry {{to be able to talk}} about this," [...] Wallace said. [...] "I love seeing <b>men</b> <b>standing</b> up for the clit [...] Not having access to the pleasure that is your birthright is a deeply political act." ...|$|E
500|$|The film shows novel {{techniques}} in film production {{that were used}} to assist the viewer in understanding the narrative. In the beginning of the film, when Harry and the thief struggle, a closeup shot is used to show the thief placing the purse into Harry's pocket. While the two struggle in the previous scene, the close-up shot has both <b>men</b> <b>standing</b> still. Charlie Keil, author of Early American Cinema in Transition, cites this as an attempt to improve the narrative by allowing a complex sequence of events to be examined intelligibly by the viewer. Keil also states that shot may have been done to lessen trade press objections to the close-up views by showing the value to the narrative development. When Harry is in jail, he imagines his mother, and this is shown by an inset at the upper right of film. Months after the film had been released, Robert Grau wrote a column in the Moving Picture World which praised the attention to detail in the production for a newspaper which was shown on camera for only a few seconds. Grau states, [...] "I was unable to discern in the few seconds the effect was on view, what means were taken to create the illusion ... and it is consoling to know that the producers of photoplays are aspiring to reach great heights in such matters." [...] An analysis of the frame shows that it was not so much an illusion as pasting the headline on the edition of August 27, 1910 of the New York City Herald Tribune. The film also shows a real and dangerous stunt executed by Crane, where he is seen [...] "sliding 40 feet down a washline to liberty in a scene that couldn't have been faked." ...|$|E
