40|$|KEY WORDS: Wire-frame models, {{constructive}} solid geometry, matching, editing tools The {{modeling of}} three-dimensional objects is a current topic in digital photogrammetric research. The modeling of buildings in digital imagery or digital surface models involving automation processes {{has reached a}} level where it can compete with classical photogrammetric stereo measurements. There are many different ways on how to integrate automation. We describe our system and its automated features that support the operator in the adaption of parametric models to multiple overlapping images. There do exist tools to automate the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>heights,</b> to automate the estimation of the form parameters or for the handling of building aggregates. With such tools we can reach about 20 seconds for the modeling of a volumetric primitive which is fully comparable to the currently used photogrammetric methods. ...|$|E

40|$|In the Bayesian {{approach}} to internal dosimetry, uncertainty and variability of biokinetic model parameters {{need to be}} taken into account. The discrete empirical Bayes approximation replaces integration over biokinetic model parameters by discrete summation in the evaluation of Bayesian posterior averages using Bayes theorem. The discrete choices of parameters are taken as best-fit point determinations of model parameters for a study subpopulation with extensive data. A simple heuristic model is constructed to numerically and theoretically study this approximation. The heuristic example is the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>heights</b> of a group of people, say from a photograph where measurement uncertainty is significant. A comparison is made of posterior mean and standard deviation of height after a measurement, (i) using the exact prior describing the distribution of true height in the population and (ii) using the approximate discrete empirical Bayes prior obtained from measurements of some study subpopulation...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Estimation of {{gestational age}} is an {{essential}} component of prenatal care. Gestational age is estimated by Last Menopausal Period, fundal height and ultrasonography. Serial measurment <b>of</b> fundal <b>height</b> and comparison with LMP predicts the G. A more accurately. Since nowadays, ultrasonography is used more frequently during pregnancy, patients have to bear more expenses. But we can use serial <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> fundal <b>height</b> for determination <b>of</b> G. A. This method is cheap, reliable and easy for assessment of G. A and fetal growth in pregnancies without serious complications. In this study, we compared the accuracy <b>of</b> Fundal <b>Height</b> <b>Measurement</b> And Ultrasonography for estimation of gestational age. Methods: In this cross sectional study we investigated and compared the accuracy <b>of</b> fundal <b>height</b> <b>measurement</b> and ultrasonography in estimation of G. A. A total of 140 pregnant mothers were selected from patients referring to gynecology and obstetrics clinic of Doctor Mojibian and Shahid Sadughi hospitals in Yazd.
