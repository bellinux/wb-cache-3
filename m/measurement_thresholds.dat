40|$|A {{statistical}} {{framework for}} climatological Z-R parameter estimation is developed and simulation experiments are {{conducted to examine}} sampling properties of the estimators. Both parametric and nonparametric models are considered. For parametric models, it is shown that Z-R parameters can be estimated by maximum likelihood, a procedure with optimal large sample properties. A general nonparametric framework for climatological Z-R estimation is also developed. Nonparametric procedures are attractive because of their flexibility in dealing with certain types of measurement errors common to radar data. Simulation experiments show that even under favorable assumptions on error characteristics of radar and raingages, large datasets are required to obtain accurate Z-R parameter estimates. Another important conclusion is that estimation results are generally quite sensitive to radar and raingage <b>measurement</b> <b>thresholds.</b> For fixed sample size, the simulation results {{can be used to}} provide quantitative assessments of the accuracy of Z-R model parameter estimates. These results are particularly useful for error analysis of precipitation products that are derived using climatological Z-R relations.

40|$|Abstract The {{effect of}} undersampling on {{estimating}} {{the size of}} extreme natural hazards from historical data is examined. Tests using synthetic catalogs indicate that the tail of an empirical size distribution sampled from a pure Pareto probability distribution can range from having one-to-several unusually large events to appearing depleted, relative to the parent distribution. Both of these effects are artifacts caused by limited catalog length. It {{is more difficult to}} diagnose the artificially depleted empirical distributions, since one expects that a pure Pareto distribution is physically limited in some way. Using maximum-like-lihood methods and the method of moments, we estimate the power-law exponent and the corner size parameter of tapered Pareto distributions for several natural hazard examples: tsunamis, floods, and earthquakes. Each of these examples has varying catalog lengths and <b>measurement</b> <b>thresholds,</b> relative to the largest event sizes. In many cases where there are only several orders of magnitude between the measurement threshold and the largest events, joint two-parameter estimation techniques are necessary to account for estimation dependence between the power-law scaling exponent and the corner size parameter. Results indicate that whereas the corner size parameter of a tapered Pareto distribution ca...|$|E

These inspection tools collect highly precise data regarding the geometry of flaws and defects in the pipe wall. In turn this data is used for fitness-for-purpose investigations, the final goal of the operator being an understanding of the true state of integrity for a given pipeline. Different physical principles are applied during the non destructive testing of pipelines, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Choosing the most suitable non destructive testing technology and therefore in line inspection tool for a given inspection task requires an understanding of these different techniques and their system specific <b>measurement</b> <b>thresholds,</b> accuracies and resolutions.

40|$|Ecological {{indicators}} are used extensively as tools to manage environmental resources. In the oceans, indicators of plankton {{can be measured}} {{using a variety of}} observing systems including: mooring stations, ships, autonomous floats and ocean colour remote sensing. Given the broad range of temporal and spatial sampling resolutions of these different observing systems, as well as discrepancies in measurements obtained from different sensors, the estimation and interpretation of plankton indicators can present significant challenges. To provide support to the assessment {{of the state of the}} marine ecosystem, we propose a suite of plankton indicators and subsequently classify them in an ecological framework that characterizes key attributes of the ecosystem. We present two case studies dealing with plankton indicators of biomass, size structure and phenology, estimated using the most spatially extensive and longest in situ and remote-sensing observations. Discussion of these studies illustrates how some of the challenges in estimating and interpreting plankton indicators may be addressed by using for example relative <b>measurement</b> <b>thresholds,</b> interpolation procedures and delineation of biogeochemical provinces. We demonstrate that one of the benefits attained, when analyzing a suite of plankton indicators classified in an ecological framework, is the elucidation of non-trivial changes in composition, structure and functioning of the marine ecosystem...|$|E

40|$|After {{selection}} of the 13 biodiversity variables (Sect. 2. 3) based on their importance and feasibility for assessment by NFIs, responses were solicited from participating countries regarding {{the degree to which}} the variables are now assessed. Two conclusions were evident: (1) most countries currently assess most of the variables, but (2) consensus is lacking on assessment methods and necessary field crew expertise, suggesting that harmonization would require emphasis on field operations. For each of the seven essential features into which the 13 variables were grouped, more detailed assessments were conducted. For forest categories, the conclusion was that the only major difference in classification systems used by European NFIs was whether potential or actual vegetation was used to define classes. Thus, the prospects for harmonization of forest categories are considered excellent. For forest structure, the prospects depend on the variable. For tree species, the prospects are excellent because the variable is assessed in the same manner by all NFIs. For dbh and height, considerable variability in measurementthresholds were found, but otherwise the harmonization prospects are good. For social position, definitions of classes varied, but harmonized estimates of proportions for dominant, intermediate, and suppressed classes are considered possible. Prospects for harmonized estimates of layers are consideraly poorer because of different definitions, thresholds and the uncertainty associated with visual assessment methods. Harmonized estimation of forest age is impeded by the increasing proportion of uneven-aged stands for which age is often not assessed, different definitions, and different assessment methods. However, agreement on dominant age as a reference definition would greatly increase the prospects. Deadwood is becoming an increasingly popular indicator of sustainable forest management. Unfortunately, considerable variability was found in deadwood definitions, components (e. g., stumps, limbs), sampling methods, and <b>measurement</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Thus, harmonized deadwood estimation will require development of bridges. Harmonization of regeneration estimates faces challenges due to differences in assessment approaches such as presence/absence versus coverage and all species versus dominant species. Harmonized estimation may be restricte to change in regeneration success. Harmonized estimation for ground vegetation also faces serious challenges due to differences in the components assessed (e. g., small trees, shrubs, herbs, bryophytes, lichens), difference in height thresholds, and differences in categories for which ground vegetation is reported. Forest naturalness integrates many of the other essential feature. However, many countries do not assess naturalness, and among those that do, assessment variables, methods, and reporting classes vary considerably. For harmonized assessment using NFI variables, the hemeroby approach, which emphasizes indications of human influence, is extremely sensitive to plot size. Harmonization using the ecosystem processes approach requires a common dbh threshold and similar plot sizes. The overall conclusion is that harmonization will be considerably easier for some essential features than for others. The factors leading to difficulties often are related to different definitions, different reporting classes, different <b>measurement</b> <b>thresholds,</b> and different features of sampling protocols such as plot sizes and configurations. Nevertheless, construction of reference definitions and bridges greatly facilitate harmonization for all essential features as is illustrated in Chap. 5...|$|E

40|$|Ambulatory blood {{pressure}} (BP) monitoring is the reference standard for out-of-clinic BP <b>measurement.</b> <b>Thresholds</b> for identifying ambulatory hypertension (daytime systolic BP [SBP]/diastolic BP [DBP] ≥ 135 / 85 mm[*]Hg, 24 -hour SBP/DBP ≥ 130 / 80 mm[*]Hg, and nighttime SBP/DBP ≥ 120 / 70 mm[*]Hg) have been derived from European, Asian, and South American populations. We determined BP thresholds for ambulatory hypertension in a US population-based sample of African American adults. We analyzed {{data from the}} Jackson Heart Study, a population-based cohort study comprised exclusively of African American adults (n= 5306). Analyses were restricted to 1016 participants who completed ambulatory BP monitoring at baseline in 2000 to 2004. Mean SBP and DBP levels were calculated for daytime (10 : 00 am- 8 : 00 pm), 24 -hour (all available readings), and nighttime (midnight- 6 : 00 am) periods, separately. Daytime, 24 -hour, and nighttime BP thresholds for ambulatory hypertension were identified using regression- and outcome-derived approaches. The composite of a cardiovascular disease or an all-cause mortality event {{was used in the}} outcome-derived approach. For this latter approach, BP thresholds were identified only for SBP because clinic DBP was not associated with the outcome. Analyses were stratified by antihypertensive medication use. Among participants not taking antihypertensive medication, the regression-derived thresholds for daytime, 24 -hour, and nighttime SBP/DBP corresponding to clinic SBP/DBP of 140 / 90 mm[*]Hg were 134 / 85 mm[*]Hg, 130 / 81 mm[*]Hg, and 123 / 73 mm[*]Hg, respectively. The outcome-derived thresholds for daytime, 24 -hour, and nighttime SBP corresponding to a clinic SBP ≥ 140 mm[*]Hg were 138 mm[*]Hg, 134 mm[*]Hg, and 129 mm[*]Hg, respectively. Among participants taking antihypertensive medication, the regression-derived thresholds for daytime, 24 -hour, and nighttime SBP/DBP corresponding to clinic SBP/DBP of 140 / 90 mm[*]Hg were 135 / 85 mm[*]Hg, 133 / 82 mm[*]Hg, and 128 / 76 mm[*]Hg, respectively. The corresponding outcome-derived thresholds for daytime, 24 -hour, and nighttime SBP were 140 mm[*]Hg, 137 mm[*]Hg, and 133 mm[*]Hg, respectively, among those taking antihypertensive medication. On the basis of the outcome-derived approach for SBP and regression-derived approach for DBP, the following definitions for daytime, 24 -hour, and nighttime hypertension corresponding to clinic SBP/DBP ≥ 140 / 90 mm[*]Hg are proposed for African American adults: daytime SBP/DBP ≥ 140 / 85 mm[*]Hg, 24 -hour SBP/DBP ≥ 135 / 80 mm[*]Hg, and nighttime SBP/DBP ≥ 130 / 75 mm[*]Hg, respectivel...|$|E
