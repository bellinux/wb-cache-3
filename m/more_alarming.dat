25|$|The {{following}} month, {{however, the}} city commissioners again approached members of Congress {{to find a}} way to have the appraisal ruling overturned. <b>More</b> <b>alarming</b> to cemetery lotholders was a new city street map, which failed to show the cemetery and instead showed extensive subdivisions on the cemetery property. In May, the city went even further and published a street extension map showing an extension of Albany Street NW through the northern part of the burial ground.|$|E
25|$|The Company had {{obtained}} Parliamentary powers {{to merge with}} the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway (GP) in 1847, but even <b>more</b> <b>alarming</b> revelations of financial impropriety emerged regarding that company, and the Caledonian considered getting authorisation to cancel the amalgamation. However it was later decided to proceed, and the amalgamation took place by Act of Parliament of 7 August 1851. The GP operated the line between Glasgow and Paisley jointly with the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G), and the Paisley line used a terminus at Bridge Street, in Glasgow.|$|E
25|$|On November 7, 1995, Mayne Queen {{departed}} from Snug Cove {{and ran into}} a neighbouring marina, heavily damaging a floating dock in addition to 12 small pleasure boats, one of which sank. The crash was primarily attributed to human error and while transferring steering and power control from one control panel to the other located in the ship. The vessel's captain was also inexperienced with the Mayne Queen and normally piloted other vessels. <b>More</b> <b>alarming</b> {{was the fact that}} the captain promptly left the scene of the accident after the incident without conducting a proper damage assessment.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Safavid da'wa (propaganda) {{continued}} in Ottoman areas – with great success. Even <b>more</b> <b>alarming</b> for the Ottomans was the successful conversion of Turcoman tribes in Eastern Anatolia, and {{the recruitment of}} these well experienced and feared fighters into the growing Safavid army. In order to stop the Safavid propaganda, Sultan Bayezid II deported large numbers of the Shi'i population of Asia Minor to Morea. However, in 1507, Shah Ismail and the Qizilbash overran large areas of Kurdistan, defeating regional Ottoman forces. Only two years later in Central Asia, the Qizilbash defeated the Uzbeks at Merv, killing their leader Muhammad Shaybani and destroying his dynasty. His head {{was sent to the}} Ottoman sultan as a warning.|$|E
25|$|Blue crab populations {{naturally}} fluctuate {{with annual}} changes in environmental conditions. They {{have been described}} as having a long-term dynamic equilibrium, which was first noted after irregular landings data in the Chesapeake in 1950. This tendency may have made it difficult for managers to predict the severe decline of the Chesapeake’s blue crab populations. Once considered an overwhelmingly abundant annoyance, the declining blue crab population is now the subject of anxiety among fishermen and managers. Over the decade between the mid-1990s to 2004, the population fell from 900 million to around 300 million, and harvest weight fell from 52,000 tons (115,000,000 lbs) to 28,000 tons (62,000,000 lbs). Revenue fell further, from $72 million to $61 million. Long term estimates say that the overall Chesapeake population decreased approximately 70% in the last few decades. Even <b>more</b> <b>alarming,</b> the number of females capable of reproducing, known as spawning age females, has plummeted 84% in just a few decades. Survival and addition of juveniles to the harvestable crab population is also low. Many factors are to blame for low blue crab numbers, including high fishing pressure, environmental degradation, and disease prevalence.|$|E
500|$|Drowning Girl {{presents}} an [...] "unmistakeable acknowledgement to the flamboyant linearism of Art Nouveau". The waves {{are intended to}} [...] "recall Hokusai {{as well as the}} biomorphic forms of Arp and Miró;" [...] just as the source comics may have intended to. [...] Lichtenstein has claimed a strong relation between the original comic book source panel and Hokusai's The Great Wave off Kanagawa, making this work a bridge between the two. [...] The adaptation of the wave print is said to add a decorative look and feel to the painting, without which the work might be much <b>more</b> <b>alarming</b> to the viewer. Lichtenstein even made the connection between Drowning Girls arabesque waves and [...] "the Art Nouveau aesthetic". Regarding this work, Lichtenstein stated: ...|$|E

500|$|The {{four-year}} {{association with}} Fenby from 1929 produced two major works, and several smaller pieces often drawn from unpublished music from Delius's early career. The {{first of the}} major works was the orchestral A Song of Summer, based on sketches that Delius had previously collected under the title of A Poem of Life and Love. In dictating the new beginning of this work, Delius asked Fenby to [...] "imagine that we {{are sitting on the}} cliffs in the heather, looking out over the sea". This does not, says Fenby, indicate that the dictation process was calm and leisurely; the mood was usually frenzied and nerve-wracking. The other major work, a setting of Walt Whitman poems with the title Songs of Farewell, was an even <b>more</b> <b>alarming</b> prospect to Fenby: [...] "the complexity of thinking in so many strands, often all at once; the problems of orchestral and vocal balance; the wider area of possible misunderstandings..." [...] combined to leave Delius and his helper exhausted after each session of work—yet both these works were ready for performance in 1932. Of the music in this final choral work, Beecham wrote of its [...] "hard, masculine vigour, reminiscent in mood and fibre of some of the great choral passages in A Mass of Life". Payne describes the work as [...] "bracing and exultant, with in places an almost Holstian clarity".|$|E

2500|$|... {{haircuts}} declined {{sharply in}} value." [...] The productive capacity of Indian industry, {{which had been}} relatively meagre after the stagnation arising from the Great Depression, faced significant capacity constraints that drove up prices of Indian goods and commodities. The rise in prices of essential goods and services was initially [...] "not unsatisfactory" [...] and [...] "not disturbing", but became <b>more</b> <b>alarming</b> in 1941. Then in early 1943, {{the rate of inflation}} for foodgrains in particular took an unprecedented upward turn.|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{the long}} {{germination}} window for tall waterhemp, a single herbicide application {{is unlikely to be}} an effective control strategy. [...] Michigan State University Extension recommends a preemergence application followed by one or more postemergence applications. Tall waterhemp have been reported resistant to acetolactate synthase inhibiting (ALS) herbicides and the triazines, with some individual weeds being resistant to both herbicides groups. [...] Resistance to acifluorfen and other diphenyl ether herbicides has been reported. Even <b>more</b> <b>alarming</b> is the emergence of waterhemp resistant to the latest generation of herbicides, HPPD inhibitors. Furthermore, waterhemp at a site in Nebraska was found to be resistant to 2,4-D, a phenoxy herbicide.|$|E
2500|$|While Christina may {{not have}} been alone in her own time for {{choosing}} masculine dress (Leonora Christina Ulfeldt, for example, was known for dressing the same way), she also had physical features some described as masculine. According to Henry II, Duke of Guise, [...] "she wears men's shoes and her voice and nearly all her actions are masculine". When she arrived in Lyon, she again wore a toque and had styled her hair like that of a young man. It was noted that she also wore large amounts of powder and face cream. In one account she [...] "was sunburnt, and she looked like a sort of Egyptian street girl, very strange, and <b>more</b> <b>alarming</b> than attractive".|$|E
