5|$|Brownsea Castle was {{purchased}} by Mary Bonham-Christie in 1927. She allowed the property to fall into disrepair {{and by the time}} of her death in 1961 it was in a very poor condition. It was then purchased by the National Trust and leased to the John Lewis Partnership, who restored it over <b>many</b> <b>years.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 21st century it is still used by the Partnership as a corporate hotel for their employees and retired staff.|$|E
5|$|By 1899, Waterloo had 16 {{platforms}} {{but only}} 10 numbers allocated in different {{sections of the}} station or on different levels; some numbers were duplicated. This complexity and confusion became the butt of jokes by writers and music hall comics for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 19th century, including Jerome K. Jerome in Three Men in a Boat. It was criticised and satirised in several Punch cartoons.|$|E

5|$|Wilber Rogan {{was born}} in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. After {{the death of his}} mother and his father's remarriage, he moved with his family to Kansas City, Kansas. He began his {{baseball}} career there in 1911 as a catcher with Fred Palace's Colts, a semipro team composed mostly of teenagers. Also joining the Colts that season was Dick Whitworth, who would, like Rogan, go on to pitch for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Negro leagues.|$|E
5|$|Bute was {{determined}} to control the local government around Cardiff, considering it part of his rights and duties as a major landowner and aristocrat. On inheriting his estates, however, he found himself facing a difficult political situation. The Butes' grip on Glamorganshire had been weakened in the late 18th century, and the management of their political interests had been left for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of John Wood, a local solicitor, whose family was embroiled in local politics, with their own set of interests. Glamorgan was also politically split between factions {{in the west and}} the east of the county, with most of Bute's estates in the eastern half. Bute's residence in the area, Cardiff Castle, was understaffed and regarded as unsuitable as a residence; consequently, he lacked the easy local patronage that would have come with a major, properly functioning establishment.|$|E
5|$|Cetiosauriscus leedsi: In 1887, John Whittaker Hulke named a {{new species}} of sauropod, Ornithopsis leedsi. He {{designated}} BMNH R.1984–1988 as its type series, bones from the collections found by Alfred Nicholson Leeds. In 1905, Harry Govier Seeley made a suggestion to Arthur Smith Woodward, who took Seeley's advice and renamed O. leedsi, Cetiosaurus leedsi. Woodward also referred an additional specimen to the species, BMNH R.3078. The specimen was mounted and displayed for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dinosaur Gallery of the British Museum of Natural History (now the Natural History Museum) in London. An additional specimen, BMNH R.3706, referred to C. leedsi under the genus Cetiosaurus, includes some ribs, and may belong to a pliosaur. All referrals of C. leedsi outside of Ornithopsis are no longer accepted, and the species is thought to represent a new indeterminate brachiosaurid.|$|E

5|$|Feeling unsuited to a {{managerial}} role {{in such an}} environment, he left Oak Ridge at the end {{of summer}} in 1947 and returned to Princeton University, although he maintained a consulting role with the facility for <b>many</b> <b>years.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> postwar period he served on a number of government bodies, including the National Bureau of Standards from 1947 to 1951, the mathematics panel of the National Research Council from 1951 to 1954, the physics panel of the National Science Foundation, and the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission from 1952 to 1957 and again from 1959 to 1964. He also contributed to civil defense.|$|E
5|$|In {{the other}} world, Oliver finds a {{multitude}} of broken-hearted people affected by Jabou, and uses his new-found magic abilities to restore those pieces of heart which they lack, and travels the world {{to seek out the}} four great sages who may be able to help. Along the way, he meets Maru, daughter of one of the great sages, and Jairo, a thief who initially steals a crucial item from them, but who ultimately decides to help. As they enlist the sages' help, they learn of a wand {{that could be used to}} defeat Jabou, but are at a loss as to how to retrieve it, as it was recently destroyed by Jabou. Soon after, they find themselves <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past by the actions of a stranger, and are able to retrieve the wand there.|$|E
5|$|In March 2009, Dave Whelan {{acquired}} {{a chain of}} fitness clubs from JJB Sports. In the process, Whelan used the business {{to set up a}} new venture, DWSportsfitness and announced that the stadium name would change to the DW Stadium in August. Whelan also announced {{that at the same time}} the stadium was renamed, its ownership would pass from himself to Wigan Athletic. Concerns about the future of Wigan Warriors were arrested in the same announcement, as Whelan extended the lease on the stadium by 50 years for the rugby league team. Before their match against Leeds Rhinos in July 2009, both clubs were given the opportunity to rename one stand, with the intention of renaming them in honour to a recognised player from each club's history. The rugby league club were granted the East Stand, which they renamed 'The Boston Stand' in tribute to the Welsh winger Billy Boston, As Wigan Athletic had spent <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower leagues it was recognised that most of their players were not known, so the West Stand was renamed 'The Springfield Stand' after the club's former ground.|$|E
