Although forest gaps are generally considered as favorable to the regeneration of this species, in this study, a preliminary inventory conducted within a selective exploitation located in the Dja district, southeastern Cameroon, found a low density of 12. 7 seedlings. ha- 1 within logging gaps. This suggests that the species was in fact poorly represented in logging gaps. In order to further study {{the behavior}} of the <b>moabi</b> in logging gaps, 795 seeds were planted in 15 logging gaps and 410 saplings from a tree nursery were introduced in 15 other gaps. A biannual monitoring spanning a period of 30 months showed a 75. 9 % survival rate for seedlings and 95. 5 % for saplings. Despite our observation of a significant difference in growth rates between both methods during the first semester, after 30 months of monitoring, seedlings and saplings had reached similar growth rates (167. 5 cm and 160. 6 cm for seedlings and saplings, respectively). On average, 6. 1 % of B. toxisperma saplings emerged naturally from the competitive vegetation and had a higher growth rate than other plants species. Growth differences between plants were mainly explained by the geographical orientation of the logging gap (N-S unfavorable) and the density of Macaranga spp. whose abundance inhibits the development of B. toxisperma. In conclusion, both the high survival rate of B. toxisperma in logging gap and its 10 fold higher growth rate in the latter environment when compared to canopy cover suggest the implementation of forestry methods using logging gap during reforesting operations...|$|E

40|$|Studies of {{regeneration}} in African {{rain forests}} suggest that without silvicultural treatments, natural succession in logging gaps may {{not result in}} the establishment of timber species. In this paper we present the results of an experimental enrichment planting with <b>moabi</b> (Baillonella toxisperma Pierre), a valuable and important timber species harvested in Central Africa. Although forest gaps are generally considered as favourable for the regeneration of this species, a survey conducted in a forest concession in southeastern Cameroon provided an estimate of only 12. 7 seedlings ha 1, suggesting that the species was, in fact, poorly represented in logging gaps within the study area. To further investigate the dynamics of the <b>moabi</b> in logging gaps, 795 seeds were sown in 15 logging gaps and 410 nursery-raised seedlings were planted in 15 other gaps. A biannual monitoring program over a 30 -month period showed a lower survival rate for seedlings from sowing (75. 9 %) compared to that of nursery-raised seedlings (95. 3 %). Planted seedlings reached on average 229. 3 cm whereas seedlings from sowing were 167. 5 cmtall, with the observed difference roughly corresponding to the average height of the nursery-raised seedlings at the time they were introduced to the logging gaps. After 30 months, the diameters of planted seedlings (16. 8 mm) were also greater than those of the directly sown individuals (12. 5 mm). Forest gap characteristics signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the growth of the plants. Factors accounting for the differences were total solar radiation, the soil content of coarse sand, the topographic position of the gap, the vegetation cover and the density of Macaranga spp. Whilst total solar radiation had a positive inﬂuence on growth, the remaining factors had impacted growth negatively. A streamlined technique was tested by planting 7 seedlings in 250 gaps. Without additional site maintenance, 29. 3 % of the <b>moabi</b> seedlings emerged naturally from the competing vegetation after 24 months. With biannual maintenance some 89. 4 % of seedlings became successfully established. Clearance operations had no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the height of plants whilst plant diameter was greater in cleared gaps. The total cost of the enrichment technique was 5. 5 EUR per gap without maintenance and 7. 5 EUR per gap with a single maintenance measure. Whilst long-term monitoring is needed, this study suggests a high survival rate of <b>moabi</b> introduced in logging gaps, and a growth rate 10 times higher than previously reported under canopy cover. These ﬁndings, combined with the low costs of the enrichment technique, support the use of silvicultural measures in logging gaps to restore the forest. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Growing {{attention}} has been paid to gender in ecological economics, political ecology and development studies but a focus on gender in resource extraction conflicts is still rare. This article explores women-led resistance movements to commercial logging in South-eastern Cameroon, focusing on the <b>moabi</b> tree (Baillonella toxisperma). The latter provides oil, medicine and other non-timber products and use-values to local forest societies and particularly to women. Resistances arise because most socio-environmental costs of the international logging trade are imposed on the rural populations and especially on women of the extractive regions. The aim of this paper is to analyze the root causes of the gender structure of such mobilisations as well as the impacts on gender relations induced by such resource extraction conflicts. After proposing a typology of different environmental currents and their gender counterparts, this paper focuses on the gender construction of local Bantu societies, taking as a point of departure Paola Tabet's thesis that masculine control over production tools is the objective factor revealing the sexual division of work. In our case study, we found that the men's control over technology not only highlights the sexual work division but also the gendered division of access rights to natural resources. Thereby, we argue that the sexual division of access rights and work [...] revealed through differentiated control over technology [...] are two key institutions explaining the gendered structure of local mobilizations. We, then, discuss the empowerment allowed by the new forms of women's organizations, with a particular focus on the appropriation of new production tools by women.

40|$|Knowledge of wood production, and {{particularly}} of diameter increment of trees, {{is central to}} forest management. This {{is one of the}} parameters contributing to determination of the length of the felling cycle as well as the maximum allowable cut without impoverishment of forest stands. Two techniques can be used to assess diameter increment of trees: analysis of growth rings and periodical measurements of circumference over a given period. The results obtained with several designs, in which trees have been periodically measured for more than ten years (Mopi, Irobo and La Téné in Cote de Ivoire, Mbaiki in Central African Republic and Oyane in Gabon), provide increments for each species. In the same way, several growth ring counts were carried out for species with visible annual growth rings, especially in Cameroon, Central African Republic and Gabon. This report describes the methodology used for growth ring analysis, the application of such analysis for each tree species, as well as a synthesis of the results obtained for the main species exploited in Central and West Africa. The following species are included: Ayous/Samba (Triplochiton sideroxylon), Sapelli (Entandrophragma cylindricum), Limba/Fraké (Terminalia superba), Sipo (Entandrophragma utile), Tali (Erythrophleum ivorense), Tiama (Entandrophragma angolensis), Kosipo (Entandrophragma candollei), Okoumé (Aucoumea klaineana) and <b>Moabi</b> (Baillonella toxisperma).

40|$|According {{to recent}} data (GLC 2000 map), African dense forests cover c. 236 million ha, that is 7. 9 % {{of the total}} {{continent}} area. The Central African forest is the last contiguous block of tropical forest in Africa; it covers an area of c. 203 million ha, whereas the forest cover of West Africa (c. 10 million ha) is highly fragmented. At {{the fringes of the}} Congo Basin, forests are replaced by woodlands and shrublands, mixed in some places with croplands. Woodlands and shrublands together cover 27 % of the continent, while grasslands represent 15 % of the land. The largest desert in the world is the Sahara desert that covers an area of c. 900 million ha or 33 % of the African continent. Agricultural activities extend over 12 % of the continent. The area of cropland is more important in West Africa than in Central Africa, respectively 16 % and 7 %. Closely related to agriculture, the deforestation rate is higher in West Africa (1. 7 % versus 0. 4 %). The other causes of deforestation are logging, mining activities, infrastructure development and fires. The most forested countries of the continent are: Central African Republic (c. 8 million ha), Gabon (c. 21 million ha), Cameroon (c. 21 million ha), Congo (c. 26 million ha) and D. R. Congo (c. 125 million ha). These five countries account for 85 % of the African dense forest. In Central Africa, 45 % of the total forest area is under a logging concession status. As a consequence, logging activities {{play a major role in}} the Central African rainforest’s future. According to the ITTO (International Tropical Timber Organization) figures, in 2003 the estimated productions of the five previously mentioned countries were: c. 7. 4 million m 3 of logs; c. 1. 1 million m 3 of sawn wood; c. 380, 000 m 3 of plywood and veneer, that is less than 1 % of the world production. Logging in Central Africa is characterized by its high selectivity. For economic reasons, only a few species are commercialized. Usually only one to two trees are felled per hectare and the cover disturbance is about 10 %. The most felled species can be grouped in two categories: hygrophilous evergreen rain forest species and moist semi-evergreen rain forest species. The first category is mainly composed of azobe Lophira alata, beli Julbernardia pellegriniana, douka Tieghemella africana, kevazingo Guibourtia spp., okoume Aucoumea klaineana, pachyloba Afzelia pachyloba, tali Erythrophleum ivorense. The second category is made up of afromosia Pericopsis elata, agba Prioria balsamifera, ayous Triplochyton scleroxylon, dibetou Lovoa trichiloides, frake Terminalia superba, iroko Milicia excelsa, kossipo Entandrophragma candollei, <b>moabi</b> Baillonella toxisperma, movingui Distemonanthus benthamianus, padouk Pterocarpus soyauxii, sapelli Entandrophragma cylindricum, sipo Entandrophragma utile. The major forest companies in the region are mostly subsidiaries of larger European firms (French, German, etc.) although Asian business is becoming more and more important. Obliged by the recent evolution of the Central African forestry laws, some of these logging companies are conceiving forest management plans. The management methods currently implemented were developed as normative regulations issued under the forest laws in the region. The basis of these methods is a statistical inventory of the resources which allows the determination of the population structures, i. e. the number of stems per diameter class. Considering increment and mortality, rotation and/or minimum felling diameters are adapted to reach a satisfactory reconstitution rate. Unfortunately, undamental knowledge about the species population dynamic parameters is still lacking and finally the precision on the rate of reconstitution after a cutting cycle is jeopardized. Moreover, these methods do not pay any attention to long-term preservation of the logged species, since species could have a satisfactory level of reconstitution after one rotation, but could disappear after a second cycle. For such species specific interventions are needed to improve their natural regeneration capacities. In this paper, examples are given for a 176, 000 ha management unit in Cameroon for flagship species: assamela Pericopsis elata, ayous Triplochyton scleroxylon, iroko Milicia excelsa, <b>moabi</b> Baillonella toxisperma, sapelli Entandrophragma cylindricum and tali Erythrophleum ivorense.

For vegetal NTFPs, the existing studies are typified by either a purely descriptive (ethno) botanical approach (lists of species used by an ethnic group) or by processing studies (transformation, conservation, economic value and commercialization of products) or by inventories defining the densities of certain species. Only a few studies examine the productivity of certain species. Within this context, one can conclude that {{there is a lack of}} studies that monitor the pressure exerted by local communities on the available products. The forest manager remains destitute while trying to monitor the level of exploitation of the ecosystem, while implementing a sustainable exploitation of the available resources or when he tries to set up conservation measures. This study aims at solving this problem. At first, a quantitative follow-up of the pressure exerted on vegetal NTFPs by a local Badjoué community living at the border of the Dja Reserve (Cameroon) is presented. This community of hunters and farmers (317 inhabitants) can be considered as representative of the way of life of many ethnic groups in rain forests. Pressure exerted is defined in terms of consumed quantities of each product and during several seasons. The consumed quantities are then converted into numbers of fructifying trees. Main results are twofold: on the one hand, the consumption of major exploited NTFPs can be expressed in terms of consumed quantities per habitant and per day during a certain period. On the other hand, we were able to calculate the number of tree stands that should be available to cope with the demands of the local community (with about 300 members). We could conclude that it is necessary — for our Badjoué community — to have 26 fructifying Irvingia gabonensis trees, 17 Baillonella toxisperma trees, 7 Ricinodendron heudelotii trees and 71 Trichoscypha spp. trees. Such research allows forest managers to consider the needs of local communities. Finally, the example of the <b>Moabi</b> (Baillonnella toxisperma Pierre) is chosen to illustrate the usefulness of this kind of approach for forest management planning...|$|E
