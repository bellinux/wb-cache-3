5|$|Through 1969, the Beatles' {{catalogue}} {{was published}} almost exclusively by Northern Songs Ltd., a company formed in February 1963 by music publisher Dick James specifically for Lennon and McCartney, though it later acquired songs by other artists. The company was organised with James and his partner, Emmanuel Silver, owning a controlling interest, variously described as 51% or 50% plus one share. McCartney had 20%. Reports again vary concerning Lennon's portion – 19 or 20% – and Brian Epstein's – 9 or 10% – which he received {{in lieu of}} a 25% band <b>management</b> <b>fee.</b>|$|E
5|$|Epstein asked {{chartered}} accountant James Trevor Isherwood {{to set up}} a company to collect Lennon and McCartney's PRS payments—called Lenmac—which he did on 12 May 1964. When he first visited Epstein's office, Isherwood was surprised to learn that Epstein took 25 per cent of the gross income, and not the 10 per cent that he believed most other managers received at that time. All of Epstein's expenses were deducted from his artists' gross income, including office rental, staff wages, travel, telephone costs, and entertaining expenses. Before his death, Epstein knew that the renegotiation of his management contract (up for renewal on 30 September 1967), would lower his <b>management</b> <b>fee</b> from 25 to 10 per cent, and that NEMS would no longer receive a share of the Beatles' performance fees, reducing its revenues still further.|$|E

40|$|The cost {{to investors}} of {{investing}} in mutual equity funds through <b>management</b> <b>fees,</b> could be substantial {{when compared to the}} return they generate. If the fees are fairly set, they should give investors a high excess return, termed alpha, when compared to a passive benchmark. <b>Management</b> <b>fees</b> have been shown to give negative excess return in the US market, and we regress the excess return of Swedish equity funds as estimated by CAPM on <b>management</b> <b>fees.</b> Our prediction is that higher <b>management</b> <b>fees</b> leads to lower alpha...|$|R
50|$|Malkiel discussed, and discarded, the {{hypothesis}} that the discount is due to the <b>management</b> <b>fees.</b> The argument of the paper is that since <b>management</b> <b>fees</b> are generally constant, this view would not explain changes {{in the size of the}} discount during the life-cycle of a fund. Furthermore, if the discount resulted from <b>management</b> <b>fees,</b> it should be related (Malkiel contended) to interest rates, yet the data do not support any such tie.|$|R

25|$|It {{was also}} in the 1960s that the common form of private equity fund, still in use today, emerged. Private equity firms {{organized}} limited partnerships to hold investments in which the investment professionals served as general partner and the investors, who were passive limited partners, put up the capital. The compensation structure, still in use today, also emerged with limited partners paying an annual <b>management</b> <b>fee</b> of 1.0–2.5% and a carried interest typically representing up to 20% of the profits of the partnership.|$|E

So far VCUQatar has 450 Alumni representing 33 nationalities. VCU received about $42 million in 2014 to operate the campus. A portion {{of this is a}} <b>management</b> <b>fee,</b> which in previous years was $3.4 million, allowing the campus to profit off of the campus. VCU is not the only US campus in Education City, and it, along with the other universities, are the subject of criticism of their implicit acceptance of Qatar's sponsorship of terrorism and egregious human rights violations.|$|E
25|$|Management {{fees are}} {{calculated}} {{as a percentage}} of the fund's net asset value and typically range from 1% to 4% per annum, with 2% being standard. They are usually expressed as an annual percentage, but calculated and paid monthly or quarterly. Management fees for hedge funds are designed to cover the operating costs of the manager, whereas the performance fee provides the manager's profits. However, due to economies of scale the <b>management</b> <b>fee</b> from larger funds can generate a significant part of a manager's profits, and as a result some fees have been criticized by some public pension funds, such as CalPERS, for being too high.|$|E
25|$|To many retail investors, {{money market}} funds are confusingly similar to {{traditional}} bank demand deposits. Virtually all large {{money market funds}} offer check writing, ACH transfers, wiring of funds, associated debit and credit cards, detailed monthly statements of all cash transactions, copies of canceled checks, etc. This makes it appear that cash is actually in the individual’s account. With net asset values reported flat at $1.00, despite the market value variance of the actual underlying assets, an impression of rock solid stability is maintained. To help maintain this impression, money market fund managers frequently forgo being reimbursed legitimate fund expenses, or cut their <b>management</b> <b>fee,</b> on an ad hoc and informal basis, to maintain that solid appearance of stability.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Management</b> <b>fees</b> are {{fees that}} are paid out of fund assets to the fund's {{investment}} adviser for investment portfolio management, any other <b>management</b> <b>fees</b> payable to the fund's investment adviser or its affiliates, and administrative {{fees payable to}} the investment adviser that {{are not included in}} the [...] "Other Expenses" [...] category (discussed below). They are also called maintenance fees.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the difference in performance and <b>management</b> <b>fees</b> between ethical and conventional mutual funds registered in Sweden. Our dataset consists of 49 ethical and 254 conventional funds, estimated on a 10 -year period of time between January 2005 to January 2015. Jensen’s alpha is used as a measure for risk-adjusted performance and estimated through CAPM single-index model as well as by Carhart’s four-factor model. By adding back the <b>management</b> <b>fees</b> to the net returns and then estimate Jensen’s alpha by Carhart’s four-factor model once again, evidence of any differences in the impact on return between ethical and conventional funds is found. The results obtained from the study show that there is no difference in neither the risk-adjusted returns nor <b>management</b> <b>fees</b> between ethical and conventional funds. It is concluded that Swedish mutual fund investors are not paying a specific price in terms of reduced returns or higher <b>management</b> <b>fees</b> for putting social and ethical values into their financial investment decision...|$|R

30|$|In the survey, {{drivers were}} asked to provide their age (AGE), gender (GEND), and {{educational}} background (EDU). Additionally, each participant was encouraged to report his/her average hours of work per day (HOUR) and number of off-duty days per week (DRES) during the past 3 years. Because taxi companies in China charge taxi drivers considerable <b>management</b> <b>fees</b> to cover operational costs, including periodic training and renewal of operating licenses, this survey also required each participant to report his/her company-charged daily <b>management</b> <b>fees</b> (FEE) to capture taxi drivers’ average economic burden.|$|R

2500|$|Many {{hedge fund}} {{investment}} strategies aim {{to achieve a}} positive return on investment regardless of whether markets are rising or falling ("absolute return"). Hedge fund managers often invest money of their own in the fund they manage. A hedge fund typically pays its investment manager an annual <b>management</b> <b>fee</b> (for example 2% of {{the assets of the}} fund), and a performance fee (for example 20% of the increase in the fund's net asset value during the year). Both co-investment and performance fees serve to align the interests of managers with those of the investors in the fund. [...] Some hedge funds have several billion dollars of assets under management (AUM).|$|E
2500|$|Funds {{may choose}} to report some {{information}} {{in the interest of}} recruiting additional investors. Much of the data available in consolidated databases is self-reported and unverified. [...] A study was done on two major databases containing hedge fund data. The study noted that 465 common funds had significant differences in reported information (e.g. returns, inception date, net assets value, incentive fee, <b>management</b> <b>fee,</b> investment styles, etc.) and that 5% of return numbers and 5% of NAV numbers were dramatically different. With these limitations, investors have to do their own research, which may cost on the scale of US$50,000 for a fund that is not well-established.|$|E
2500|$|Lind {{demanded the}} fee in advance. Barnum agreed, and she {{accepted}} the offer, which would permit her {{to raise a}} huge fund for charities, principally endowing schools for poor children in Sweden. To raise the fee, Barnum borrowed heavily on his mansion and his museum. [...] Still slightly short, he persuaded a Philadelphia minister, who thought that Lind {{would be a good}} influence on American morals, to lend him the final $5,000. The contract also gave Lind the option of withdrawing from the tour after sixty or one hundred contracts, paying Barnum $25,000 if she did so. [...] Lind and her small company sailed to America in September 1850. As a result of Barnum's months of preparations, Lind was a celebrity even before she arrived in the U.S., and close to 40,000 greeted her at the docks and another 20,000 at her hotel, the press was in attendance, and [...] "Jenny Lind items" [...] were available. When she realized how much money Barnum stood to make from the tour, Lind insisted on a new agreement, which he signed on September 3, 1850. This gave her the original fee plus the remainder of each concert's profits after Barnum's $5,500 <b>management</b> <b>fee</b> was paid. She was determined to accumulate as much money as possible for her charities.|$|E
