Patients returned to sports at an average of 6 months postoperatively (range, 4 to 44) and to their previous level of sports at an average of 12 months (range, 8 to 18). The mean increase in humeral retroversion was 29 degrees (range, 18 degrees to 44 degrees) Three women with preoperative multidirectional hyperlaxity were considered to have failed results. Derotational humeral osteotomy can be considered in the throwing athlete with posterosuperior impingement after failure of all other means of treatment. Careful patient selection and preoperative evaluation of humeral retroversion is important. Best results can be achieved in a motivated patient with low retroversion (< 10 degrees). If retroversion is normal (20 degrees to 30 degrees), the surgical indication is unclear. We do not recommend this surgery for patients with hyperlaxity...|$|E
40|$|Hypothesis / aims {{of study}} The primary {{objective}} of this prospective randomized study is to evaluate the anatomical efficacy {{and the safety of}} two different transvaginal techniques for suspension of the superior vaginal segment in patients with Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) > stage 2 : High Levator <b>Myorraphy</b> (HLM) (1) and Uterosacral Vaginal Vault Suspension (UVVS) (2). The secondary objective is to define the impact of these procedures on anorectal function, sexuality and Quality of Life (QoL) Study design, materials and methods Between September 2005 and December 2006, 116 female patients were enrolled. The pre-operative work-up included: history, POP-Q score, Q-Tip test, conventional urodynamic studies and questionnaires (King’s Health Questionnaire, Wexner score for constipation, and a Sexuality score). The patients were randomized into two groups (computer generated randomization list) : in the first group we used the HLM procedure for vaginal vault suspension; in the second group the UVVS was performed. All the patients underwent correction of cystocele with a Polypropylene mesh applied “tension-free” and vaginal hysterectomy. The results were analyzed using: T-test, McNemar Chi-squared test and Mann-Whitney U test.

In the UVVS procedure, angulation of the left ureter with hydronephrosis was observed in 5 patients (8. 6 %) which was diagnosed in the immediate post-operative period and resolved after removal of the suture. No intra-operative complications occured in the HLM group. Vaginal mesh erosions were present in 12 % of HLM group and 17 % in UVVS group (p 0. 34) Interpretation of results Both procedures provide significant anatomical correction of all vaginal segments. However the correction of the anterior segment was less effective. A possible explanation for this finding could be that the vaginal axis is displaced caudally by vault suspension. An additional aggravating factor could be the tension free application of the mesh anteriorly without anchoring sutures which does not provide adequate contrast to the tension resulting from the central segment suspension. The mean Total Vaginal Length is 7. 2 cm in HLM and 8. 9 cm in UVVS group (p 0. 04), but this does not coincide with an improvement in sexuality, as demonstrated by incidence of post-operative dyspareunia. There is a statistically significative improvement of the voiding symptoms, prolapse-related symptoms, with a good impact on the quality of life. Concluding message This study demonstates that the two vaginal vault suspension techniques are equivalent regarding anatomy, function and QoL. UVVS has a higher incidence of major complications involving the higher urinary tract, which, in our opinion, is an important factor to consider when selecting the appropriate surgical procedure. The recent introduction of trans-perineal techniques for the correction of central vaginal prolapse seems promising, and results of ongoing trials are eagerly awaited. References 1.
