50|$|<b>Meg{{ohmmeter}}</b> is {{a special}} type of ohmmeter {{used to measure the}} electrical resistance of insulators. Insulating components, for example cable jackets, must be tested for their insulation strength at the time of commissioning and as part of maintenance of high voltage electrical equipment and installations. For this purpose megohmmeters, which can provide high DC voltages (typically in ranges from 500 V to 5 kV, some are up to 15 kV) at specified current capacity, are used. Acceptable insulator resistance values are typically 1 to 10 megohms, depending on the standards referenced.|$|E

The influences of reaction temperature, time and O-MMT Loading on intercalated reaction were systematically studied by XRD and TEM, finding the optimum condition of 65 ºC, 72 h, and O-MMT 4 wt%. Moreover, the Mechanical and electrical properties of vulcanized CR/O-MMT nanocomposites were tested by electron pull machine, sclerometer, super-high <b>megohmmeter.</b> The nanocomposites exhibited better antistatic property, hardness, tensile strength, especially stresses at strains of 300 % and 500 %, which were remarkably enhanced {{in comparison with}} the CR/silica white composites...|$|E
40|$|Condition {{monitoring}} on {{electric motor}} is a preventive maintenance {{in order to}} avoid problems and hazard from happening to the machinery, also to prevent personal injury with the major factor is insulation resistance. In this thesis, to further discuss this issue, the developed experiment with the measuring technique of the condition of electric motor on insulation resistance is used. Then, the experiment rig was developed applied to Thrige Odense Denmark 3 -phase induction motor for case stud} to obserxe the condition monitoring on insulation resistance. The validity of the data was then taken using the <b>megohmmeter</b> and temperature indicator. The experiment is to monitor the Denmark manufactured motor condition of insulation whether is good. fair, poor or bad by following the IEEE standard procedure. This prexentixe maintenance test can be done on a monthlx. semiannual or annual basis as conditions demand. The data from the test is plotted to graph to get the trended data of the insulation. The theoretical and experiment studies include the effect of the humiditx and temperature to the insulation. Tests rig for the experimental work are developed using IEEE Standard 43 - 2000. IEEE Recommended Practice for Testing Insulation Resistance of Rotating Machinery and A Guide To Diagnostic Insulation Testing Above lkV by Megger Ltd. Second Edition 2002. The results have been compared to the standard and analyses are presented in graph. From the developed procedure and methods prove that the temperature affects the insulation winding at 3 -phase induction motor (2 speed : 2 winding). For case study, the motor has been soaked for three days to apply flooded condition. The result shows that the motor insulation condition is even better after comparison with the standard manufactured data at 821 MH and 893 MH change to more than 999 Mfi for both winding condition after drying out experiment...|$|E

50|$|An {{ohmmeter}} is {{an electrical}} instrument that measures electrical resistance, {{the opposition to}} an electric current. Micro-ohmmeters (microhmmeter or microohmmeter) make low resistance measurements. <b>Megohmmeters</b> (also a trademarked device Megger) measure large values of resistance. The unit of measurement for resistance is ohms (Ω).|$|R
