500|$|The book is 15,000 words {{long and}} was first {{published}} in January 2011 as an electronic book only, priced at USD$4. The Economist noted that the [...] "publishing model is fascinating in its own right". A hardback version, which Cowen dubbed [...] "the retrogression", was published in June 2011. Yglesias described the publication as an innovation in [...] "current affairs publishing" [...] and [...] "much shorter and cheaper than a conventional book in a way that actually leaves you wanting to read more once you finish it. <b>My</b> <b>guess</b> is that this is the future of books." [...] The book has been compared to economic and political pamphlets of the 17th century, which were frequently used to quickly get ideas about current affairs into circulation.|$|E
500|$|When Carter goes {{undercover}} in the episode, {{she wears}} a dress inspired by the evening dresses of the 1930s and 40s, which the script described as a [...] "Veronica Lake look". Ottobre-Melton noted that [...] "We got to make Peggy into the classic femme fatale". For the character of Colleen O'Brien, series costume designer Giovanna Ottobre-Melton saw her as [...] "a hard working girl making just enough to get by. The war term 'Mend and Make Do' really applies to her. She has a few nice pieces in her closet that she scrimped and saved to buy. <b>My</b> <b>guess</b> is {{she knows how to}} unravel an old tired sweater to knit herself a new one." [...] The man in the green suit [...] "wore a suit that was a tricky balance," [...] explained Ottobre-Melton. [...] "The goal was to find a green that wasn't over the top, but still made a powerful statement. The suit I designed was inspired by a 1940s green double breasted suit I had located." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film's opening {{scenes are}} not great filmmaking. They're heavy on jargon and impenetrable calculation, murky and heavy on theory. [...] <b>My</b> <b>guess</b> {{is that much}} of the fascination with this film is {{inspired}} by the unveiling of facts, unclearly seen. There isn't a whole lot of plot– basically, just that Maya thinks she is right, and she is.|$|E
60|$|These are <b>my</b> <b>guesses</b> {{concerning}} the means whereby the understanding comes {{to have and}} retain simple ideas, and the modes of them, with some other operations about them.|$|R
60|$|He {{listened with}} a simple joy in it, and his {{pleasure}} strengthened the mystic bond which had formed itself between us through the confidences he had made me, so flatteringly corroborative of all <b>my</b> <b>guesses</b> concerning him and his party.|$|R
60|$|He {{burst out}} {{laughing}} maliciously, he penetrated <b>my</b> jealousy, and <b>guessed</b> <b>my</b> question almost before it had passed my lips.|$|R
2500|$|Romney's {{campaign}} speeches sometimes {{contained a}} standard {{response to the}} religion issue as a whole: [...] "I believe in God. I believe in the family. I believe in America's future. It has a great role to preserve the peace on the planet. So the kinds of values I have are very much in line {{with those of the}} American people. <b>My</b> <b>guess</b> is as they get to know me better, there will be other faults that they find more troubling." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a Washington Post profile a {{few months}} after the September trip, Bronfman laid out what he thought had been {{accomplished}} during his September meetings. He said, [...] "There's going to be a buildup of pressure through the business community. The Russians know the Soviet Jewry issue is tied to trade ... <b>My</b> <b>guess</b> is that over a period of time, five to ten years, some of our goals will be achieved." [...] Author Gal Beckerman says in his When They Come For Us We'll Be Gone, [...] "Bronfman had a business man's understanding of the Soviet Jewish issue. It was all a matter of negotiation, of calculating what the Russians really wanted and leveraging that against emigration." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the book's publication, {{legal counsel}} for Cruise made {{statements}} to the press regarding the author's research. [...] When an attorney for Tom Cruise read reports that Morton had obtained letters asserting Cruise had a homosexual affair while filming Eyes Wide Shut, he commented on a November 2005 letter he had written to Morton: [...] "I {{wrote a letter to}} Mr. Morton back in November and said he obviously was entitled to write the book but 'make sure you check your facts'. If he tries to use my letter to create the impression that Mr. Cruise did have a gay affair, we will certainly sue … because the story is false. Mr. Cruise is not gay." [...] In an interview with InTouch Weekly, Cruise's attorney Bertram Fields commented on the book: [...] "To the extent that Mr. Morton's book sticks to the truth, it can't 'ruin' or 'harm' Tom … <b>My</b> <b>guess</b> is this book will be dull except for those parts that are lies." [...] Cruise's publicist also stated that the book will consist of fabricated lies.|$|E
6000|$|... "That sounds wrong," [...] he said slowly. [...] "As for {{the other}} I can't make up <b>my</b> mind. I <b>guess</b> <b>my</b> ear ain't had the trainin' yours has." ...|$|R
60|$|Often {{since that}} time I have marvelled how Ayesha {{performed}} this miracle, and from what substances she gathered or compounded the lightning-like material, which was her servant in the work; also, whether or no it had been impregnated with the immortalizing fire of Life that burned in the caves of Kor.[*] Yet to this hour I have found no answer to the problem, for it is beyond <b>my</b> <b>guessing.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{he chose}} Mr. Allen's name," [...] she said, [...] "is {{absolutely}} beyond <b>my</b> <b>guessing.</b> Unless {{there is some}} purpose behind the choice, which I do not for an instant believe, it was a foolish thing to do, and one very apt to lead to difficulties. I can understand the rest. He {{has a reputation for}} eccentricity which he feels he must keep up, and this notion of assuming a name evidently appealed to him as an inspiration." ...|$|R
2500|$|Several {{months after}} declaring his {{retirement}} from mixed martial arts, B.J. Penn {{announced that he}} would be returning to the octagon after repeated challenges made by welterweight prospect Rory MacDonald; stating, [...] "Rory, I accept your challenge!". Initially, Penn was expected to face Rory MacDonald on September 22, 2012 at UFC 152. [...] However, MacDonald pulled out of the bout after sustaining a cut to the forehead while training. Penn vs. MacDonald eventually took place on December 8, 2012 at UFC on Fox 5. [...] Penn lost the fight via unanimous decision. After the fight Dana White stated that he'd like to see B.J. Penn retire from mixed martial arts, although Penn has hinted a desire to return to the UFC's lightweight division. Following months of silence regarding his future, Penn spoke with Ariel Helwani in an interview for UFC on Fox, where he admitted that he was still undecided on his future, telling him that [...] "at this moment, <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> is probably a little better than yours, but I don't know, I'm enjoying what I'm doing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2011, Car Magazine {{conducted}} a comparison test between Lexus LFA and Lamborghini Aventador. The Aventador had a 139 HP {{advantage over the}} Lexus LFA. However, Lexus LFA weighs almost 230kg less. The magazine had established the Lexus LFA engine as the better of the two going as far as saying that [...] " [...] is powered by the best engine this side of Paul Rosche’s masterpiece {{in the back of}} a McLaren F1." [...] Regarding the exterior look of the Lexus LFA, editor commented [...] "To me LFA is a glorious looking car - beautifully proportioned and meticulously finished and with drama in every crease and curve". Once the editors had the cars on mountain roads, clearly Lexus LFA seemed to make a very positive impression on the editors as they commented [...] "The way the Aventador quickly reverses in my rearview mirror, <b>my</b> <b>guess</b> was not far off". [...] " [...] zings between hairpins and then peels cleanly into them, front end assured, but never artificially pointy and the rear noticeably wants to edge just a few degreess wide as the V10 feeds the rear tires with its buzzsaw power". In the end in terms of sheer driving enjoyment, the editors were clear that Lexus LFA was the more enjoyable car of the two.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{present a}} statistical-based {{approach}} to the part-of-speech guessing problem. I see assigning a part-of-speech, such as Adjective or Noun, as a classification problem. <b>My</b> <b>guessing</b> framework, which relies on automated learning of a language model, is described in detail. The rich feature analysis presented is suitable for linguistic data, {{such as the ones}} observed in German. I use a large margin classifier learning algorithm to select relevant features and learn appropriate labelling. The system is evaluated using a German corpus. ...|$|R

6000|$|The bishop was reluctantly interested. [...] "That does {{describe}} something--of {{the mental}} side," [...] he admitted. [...] "I never believe in concealing my own thoughts from an intelligent patient," [...] said Dr. Dale, {{with a quiet}} offensiveness. [...] "That sort of thing belongs to the dark ages of the 'pothecary's art. I will tell you exactly <b>my</b> <b>guesses</b> and suppositions about you. At the base of it all is a slight and subtle kidney trouble, due I suggest to your going to Princhester and drinking the local water--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And afterward? <b>My</b> <b>guess</b> isn't flattering, but I can't blame you, Jake. You {{believed}} I {{was what}} you call a sucker, sent here because I was too big a fool to find things out." ...|$|E

60|$|Events, are {{consequential}} or inconsequential {{irrespective of}} their size. The wars of Troy were fought for a woman, and Charles VIII, of France, bumped {{his head against}} a stone doorway and died {{because he did not}} stoop low enough. And to descend from history down to my own poor chronicle, Mr. Cooke's railroad case, my first experience at the bar of any gravity or magnitude, had tied to it a string of consequences then far beyond <b>my</b> <b>guessing.</b> The suit was my stepping-stone not only to a larger and more remunerative practice, but also, I believe, to the position of district attorney, which I attained shortly afterwards.|$|R
