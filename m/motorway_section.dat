5|$|Fischer {{attempted}} to gain wider {{support for the}} cooperation schemes already in place and extend their scope in Sector West. Fischer also assured the local authorities of the RSK that {{such a move would}} prevent renewed fighting in the area. The result of Fischer's efforts was the Daruvar Agreement. The agreement, signed in Daruvar on 18 February, encompassed the reconstruction of water and electrical power supply networks, the reopening of the Zagreb–Belgrade <b>motorway</b> <b>section</b> in Sector West for non-commercial traffic, the facilitation of the Novska–Nova Gradiška railway, the repair of telecommunication lines, the establishment of a joint commission tasked with normalisation of living conditions in Sector West, the return of all refugees to their homes, the access to property owned by civilians across the ceasefire line, and further meetings with local authorities to discuss further cooperation.|$|E
5|$|The A1 {{motorway}} {{was originally}} {{designed in the}} early 1970s, albeit along a different route than the present Zagreb–Split motorway route. After suppression of the Croatian Spring and removal of the Croatian leadership that proposed and adopted the construction plan in 1971, all the work related to the Zagreb–Split motorway was cancelled. The plans were revived in the 1990s and new designs were developed to include a <b>motorway</b> <b>section</b> built between Zagreb and Karlovac into the design so that the section could be shared between Zagreb–Split and Zagreb–Rijeka motorways. Construction work started in 2000 and the motorway reached Split by 2005 and was extended towards Dubrovnik later on. Both in the 1970s and in the 2000s, construction of the Zagreb–Split motorway was perceived to symbolize rebuilding of national unity.|$|E
5|$|Further {{construction}} of the motorway was suspended by {{the onset of the}} Croatian War of Independence. In October 1991, a part of the motorway between Novska and Nova Gradiška became inaccessible to the government of the Republic of Croatia due to military occupation of the area by the forces of the so-called SAO Western Slavonia. Consequently, the NovskaNova Gradiška section was closed to all traffic. On December 21, 1994, negotiations led to the reopening of that section for transit traffic. However, the section remained unsafe for use as intermittent violence continued until May 1995, when the area was overrun by the Croatian army. Inspection of the <b>motorway</b> <b>section</b> carried out at the time revealed damage to a viaduct carrying the motorway over the ZagrebSisakVinkovci railroad and a local road near Novska. Besides the overall lack of maintenance during the period, the pavement and a number of flyovers were damaged by artillery bombardments, and the flyover approach embankments were damaged where trenches were dug.|$|E

25|$|Recently, {{one section}} of the future European {{motorway}} corridor 5C was constructed and opened for traffic near Sarajevo. Soon the Federal government will start construction on a new 40km long <b>motorway</b> <b>section</b> from Sarajevo to Zenica. The construction of the whole 330km of 5C was planned to be started in spring 2006, and worth approximately 3 billion euros.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} scheme did not terminate at {{this point}} as a new realigned N3 2+2 Non <b>Motorway</b> <b>section</b> continued {{from the end of}} the Motorway past Kells before terminating near the County Cavan border. The overall scheme also included the N52 Kells northern bypass. Since completion, the M3 now bypasses Dunshaughlin, Navan, and Kells along with Cavan which was bypassed much earlier.|$|E

25|$|Between 1996 and 1999 the M1 section {{north of}} the M62 {{underwent}} a major reconstruction and extension to take the M1 on a new route to the A1(M) at Aberford. The new road involved {{the construction of a}} series of new junctions, bridges and viaducts to the east of Leeds. When the new section of M1 was completed and opened on 4 February 1999, the Leeds South Eastern <b>Motorway</b> <b>section</b> of the M1 was redesignated as the M621 and the junctions were given new numbers (M621 Junctions 4 to 7).|$|E
25|$|The {{prefabricated}} piles, {{manufactured by}} Tvornica Betonskih Stupova – TBS in Jastrebarsko, and {{sections of the}} steel structural elements, manufactured by Đuro Đaković in Slavonski Brod, were delivered to the construction site by trucks. The steel structure was assembled on the northern (Hungarian) {{bank of the river}} followed by incremental launching of the superstructure. The bridge design was developed by Hungarian company Uvaterv, and the bridge construction works were performed by Croatian Hidroelektra-Niskogradnja. Bridge equipment was installed by Dalekovod. Total cost of the bridge construction works was 8million kuna (1.08million euro). The cost was shared equally by Croatia and Hungary. Additional 50million kuna (6.7million euro) was required to build the connecting <b>motorway</b> <b>section</b> north of Goričan interchange.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the large}} effort {{that was made}} in 2004 to improve the {{motorway}} features of the Thessaloniki ring road, the motorway is still insufficient to tackle Thessaloniki's increasing traffic and metropolitan population. To tackle this problem, the government has introduced large scale redevelopment plans throughout 2011 with tenders expected to be announced within early 2012; that include the total restructuring of the A16 in {{the western side of}} the city, with new junctions and new emergency lanes throughout the whole length of the motorway. In the eastern side an even larger scale project has been announced, {{for the construction of a}} new elevated <b>motorway</b> <b>section</b> above the existing, which would allow faster travel for drivers heading through to the airport and Chalkidiki that do not wish to exit into the city, and will decongest the existing motorway for city commuters. The plans also include adding one more lane in each direction on the existing A16 ring road and on the A25 passing through Thessaloniki's southeast suburbs, from its junction with the A16 in Kalamaria, up to the airport exit (ΕΟ67); which will make it an 8 lane highway.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the elasticities {{of demand}} in tolled motorways in Spain {{with respect to}} the main variables influencing it. The demand equation is estimated using a panel data set where the cross-section observations correspond to the different Spanish tolled <b>motorways</b> <b>sections,</b> and the temporal dimension ranges {{from the beginning of the}} eighties until the end of the nineties. The results show a high elasticity {{with respect to the}} economic activity level. The average elasticity with respect to petrol price falls around - 0. 3, while toll elasticities clearly vary across <b>motorway</b> <b>sections.</b> These <b>motorway</b> <b>sections</b> are classified into four groups according to the estimated toll elasticity with values that range from - 0. 21 for the most inelastic to - 0. 83 for the most elastic. The main factors that explain such differences are the quality of the alternative road and the length of the section. The long-term effect is about 50 per cent higher than the short term one; however, the period of adjustment is relatively short. Demand elasticity, tolled motorways, private transport. ...|$|R

25|$|In 2005, {{upon the}} opening of the South Eastern <b>Motorway</b> <b>section</b> of the M50, the National Roads Authority erected new style gantry signage. The new signage {{retained}} typical colours and fonts but differed from older side of road signage in that it used separate overhead panels for each lane, headed with the route number in each case as well as new half-gantry signs closer to the exit. The new signage was also erected on the N2 Finglas – Ashbourne scheme and N7 Clondalkin – Naas scheme. These were the first roads in Ireland where overhead gantry signage {{has been used as a}} matter of course, instead of just very major junctions. Drivers are given clear advanced warning 1km ahead of an upcoming junction. A half gantry at the junction then directed them to their destination. The new style signage is visually clearer than older type signage with drivers able to read the gantry signage from a distance of approximately 300m on a straight stretch of road. Despite its significant advantages, the new gantry signage caused confusion because the downward arrows over the left traffic lanes seemed to indicate to drivers that they should pull out into the right lane if they wish to continue on the motorway or dual carriageway, breaking the keep left rule.|$|E
500|$|The <b>motorway</b> <b>section</b> {{that was}} {{eventually}} constructed through Twyford Down completed {{the route of}} the M3 motorway. This removed traffic from the earlier Winchester Bypass, allowing its closure, and significantly reduced heavy traffic volumes from the village of Twyford. When interviewed for The Independent, local residents said the removal had transformed the place, one adding [...] "St. Catherine's Hill used to be cut off from Winchester by the A33.

500|$|A {{portion of}} western Slavonia, {{encompassing}} an area approximately , was {{designated as the}} UNPA Western Slavonia (or Sector West) by the peace plan. [...] Although unlike other UNPAs, the RSK controlled only {{about one-third of the}} area—in the south, centred on the town of Okučani—the RSK-held area included a section of the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway. Sector West was divided into four areas of responsibility (AORs). The western portion of the <b>motorway</b> <b>section</b> and its surroundings were assigned to a Jordanian battalion of the UNPROFOR (JORDBAT), and the area to the east (containing the rest of the motorway within the UNPA and the town of Okučani) was the AOR of a Nepalese battalion (NEPBAT). To the north of the JORDBAT and NEPBAT AORs, a Canadian battalion (CANBAT 1) AOR was established. The northernmost portion of Sector West became the AOR of an Argentine battalion (ARGBAT). Unlike the Canadians, who had at their disposal 83 armoured personnel carriers, the Jordanian and Nepalese troops were equipped with small arms only. Sector West was commanded by Argentine Brigadier General Carlos Maria Zabala, and most of the staff work was assigned to the Canadians. The UNPROFOR established two storage depots for Army of the RSK (ARSK) heavy weapons, near Pakrac and in Stara Gradiška, and the HV moved its heavy weapons [...] away from Sector West. Although the storage facilities were guarded by the UNPROFOR, the RSK was allowed access to maintain the weapons.|$|E

Running clockwise from the M1 the zones were defined for Zones 1 to 4 based on the proposed M2, M3 and M4 motorways. The M5 and M6 numbers were reserved for the other two planned long distance motorways.
