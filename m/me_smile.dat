500|$|Critics commended the {{development}} of the relationship between Maggie Green and Glenn. Andrew Conrad of The Baltimore Sun stated that the storyline epitomized a [...] "steamy romance", while The Wall Street Journal Aaron Rutkoff called it [...] "the funniest moment of the series." [...] Goldman opined that their sexual encounter felt genuine; [...] "He's a nice guy, she seems like a cool gal, and it felt genuine when she noted she felt plenty lonely too and ready for some companionship." [...] Nick Venable of Cinema Blend asserted that the interactions between Maggie and Glenn was the highlight of the episode. [...] "I'm glad the writers are introducing this comic book plot point, as this show seriously needs a couple without closets full of skeletons. When Glenn accidentally grabs a box of condoms for Maggie to see, I chuckled heartily. The ensuing conversation also made <b>me</b> <b>smile,</b> which makes me wonder why humor is paid the least amount of attention on the show." [...] Jackson was surprised with the scene, and called it [...] "unexpected". Jen Chenay of The Washington Post compared Glenn to Little Mikey from the Life advertisements, and summated: [...] "He has assumed this role without much choice in the matter, but he has done so with a certain quiet, occasionally petrified, baseball-cap-wearing dignity that makes him admirable." ...|$|E
