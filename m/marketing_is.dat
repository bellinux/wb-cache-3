25|$|Prior {{to credit}} cards, each {{merchant}} had to evaluate each customer's credit history before extending credit. That task is now {{performed by the}} banks which assume the credit risk.

25|$|One of {{the issues}} arising from {{unsolicited}} phone <b>marketing</b> <b>is</b> the dealing in individuals' personal information, ie. financial institutions selling personal information, balances and transaction information to third parties. However financial services companies, those that offer both banking, insurance, and investment products, say that the issue and attempted legislation on the topic was caused by smaller financial institutions who simply focused on one type of product or business. The {{reason for this is}} that combining all those products with one company creates a Walmart-style economies of scale and other synergies which are difficult to compete against as a single product line company. By putting forth legislation which forbids financial institutions from sharing information with other companies, single-product-line financial institutions could cripple integrated financial services companies because of the technicality that the banking, investments, and insurance parts of the business had to be operated under separate company affiliates within a holding company. Most financial services companies claim that they have never sold information to non-financial services companies. Some critics of financial institutions agreed with this analysis but continued to press for the legislation because they believed that the financial services integrated business model was fundamentally wrong; however the vast majority of critical articles focused on the issue of selling information to outside telemarketers.|$|E

Similar teams were established in Manchester, Birmingham, and Leeds. The company denied that it was a marketing campaign; a spokesman told The Times that [...] "we haven't done... tests on inner city roads. That is what the team is doing. <b>Marketing</b> <b>is</b> not the prime function but will undoubtedly be a spin-off." [...] Sinclair was reported to be surprised at the lack of demand and blamed the press for [...] "a lack of foresight and pessimistic reporting". Matters did not improve. The retail chain Comet acquired 1,600 C5s but nine months later most were still unsold.|$|E
