5|$|A cadet's class rank, which determines {{his or her}} Army {{branch and}} {{assignment}} upon graduation, is calculated as a combination of academic performance(55%), <b>military</b> <b>leadership</b> performance(30%), and physical fitness and athletic performance(15%).|$|E
5|$|British <b>military</b> <b>leadership,</b> {{which had}} been decisive up to Brock's death, {{suffered}} a blow with his loss. His direct successor, Major-General Sheaffe, although successful in his approach at Queenston Heights, {{was never able to}} live up to Brock's reputation. He was criticised by many, including John Strachan, for his retreat at the Battle of York, and was shortly after recalled to England, where he continued a successful, if not brilliant, military career.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1918 the cathedral {{was in danger of}} an attack by the Turks. Prior to the May 1918 Battle of Sardarabad, which took place just miles away from the cathedral, the {{civilian}} and <b>military</b> <b>leadership</b> of Armenia suggested Catholicos Gevorg (George) V to leave for Byurakan for security purposes, but he refused. The Armenian forces eventually repelled the Turkish offensive and set the foundation of the First Republic of Armenia.|$|E
5000|$|The {{weakness}} of mechanized corps lay {{not in the}} design of their equipment, but rather in its poor mechanical state, the inadequate training of their crews, and the abysmal quality of Soviet <b>military</b> <b>leaderships</b> in the first month of the war.|$|R
5000|$|At first, the MDB {{had almost}} no power or {{influence}} in the ARENA-dominated Congress. As such, it boycotted the indirect presidential elections; in practice, these elections merely served to rubber-stamp the <b>military</b> <b>leadership's</b> choice of president, and ARENA's majority was so massive that any MDB candidate stood virtually no chance.|$|R

5|$|On 28 July 1914, the First World War began; On 4 August, Germany invaded Belgium and the United Kingdom {{entered the}} war to uphold the Treaty of London (1839). Britain faced a {{continental}} war it {{was not prepared to}} fight; the Expeditionary Force was dispatched but the country lacked the forces required for the protracted war envisioned by the <b>military</b> <b>leadership.</b>|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{establishment}} of the revolutionary committee, however, a faction opposing Pan emerged and sought to remove him from power. Pan became involved in factional violence. He jailed people from the rival faction, including party members and ordinary people. His supporters and opponents fought each other in major armed conflicts, and Pan had serious disagreements with the local <b>military</b> <b>leadership.</b> In June 1971, the central government dismissed him from his posts and put him under investigation.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by {{the rapid}} {{collapse}} of the KPA, China's Chairman Mao Zedong ordered the People's Liberation Army's North East Frontier Force to be reorganized into the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) for the upcoming intervention in Korea. Despite Mao's determination to save North Korea from capitulation, the Chinese <b>military</b> <b>leadership</b> expressed doubts {{on the ability of}} the Chinese army to fight against the more modernized US forces. As a compromise, Mao authorized the First Phase Campaign, a bridgehead building operation with limited offensives against only the South Korean forces while avoiding contacts with the US forces. Under strict secrecy, the PVA entered Korea on 19 October.|$|E

5|$|Alexander III of Macedon (356–323BC), {{best known}} as Alexander the Great, was an Ancient Greek king of Macedon who reigned from 336BC until his death. He is widely {{regarded}} as one of the greatest military tacticians and strategists in history, and is presumed undefeated in battle. Renowned for his <b>military</b> <b>leadership</b> and charisma, he always led his armies personally and took to the front ranks of battle. By conquering the Persian Empire and unifying Greece, Egypt and Babylon, he forged the largest empire of the ancient world and effected the spread of Hellenism throughout Europe and Northern Africa.|$|E
5|$|Although other retired {{high-ranking}} officers, including generals James Gavin and Matthew Ridgway, joined Shoup in this, it was Shoup's pointed criticisms {{that regularly}} made {{the front pages}} of newspapers, because they went beyond the war to American government, business, and <b>military</b> <b>leadership.</b> He feared the conflict had endangered the nation's historical identity, and argued increasing the troop levels in Vietnam would only aggravate the strategic problems there. Historian Robert Buzzanco noted that Shoup may have been the most vocal former military member to oppose the war.|$|E
5|$|Another USCGA {{graduate}} was Lieutenant John Gazzo Martinez, who {{was born}} in New Orleans and entered the service during World War II. He received an Academy appointment in 1946, and in 1951 was commissioned an ensign in the Coast Guard. From 1954 to 1956 LTjg. Martinez served as commanding officer at the LORAN Transmitting Station in Yonago, Japan. Martinez prepared and delivered classes in LORAN (Long Range Aids to Navigation) procedures at the U.S. Air Force 34th Bombardment Squadron which was stationed nearby. He was later assigned as advisor in the U.S. Naval Mission to the Haitian Garde-Cotes d'Haiti. He taught classes for the Haitian <b>military</b> <b>leadership</b> and later oversaw the overhaul of Garde-Cotes patrol vessels.|$|E

50|$|In 1924 Valve {{started as}} {{commander}} of coastal artillery {{and in the}} following year, just {{at the age of}} 29, he was promoted colonel; in the 1920s Valve was the fastest promoted member of the Jäger Movement. One reason for the quickly progressed career was the <b>military</b> <b>leadership's</b> aim to push aside the older officers served in the Imperial Russian Army, and place the jägers in the key positions. During 1925-1926 went through Commander Course in General Staff College.|$|R
25|$|Both the {{criticism}} {{and the public}} response to it indicate a deepening level of dissent, not only within the kingdom's religious establishment, but also among the public. It is significant that the question was asked and answered in a public forum, and then reprinted in the media -- including the Arabic and English language newspapers. Similar questions of legitimacy will arise in coming months, with the kingdom's religious, political and perhaps <b>military</b> <b>leaderships</b> becoming the focal points for increasingly intense criticism.|$|R
5|$|Aside from Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, master gunnery {{sergeant}} (MGySgt) and {{sergeant major}} {{are the highest}} enlisted ranks in the Marine Corps; however, there are far fewer master gunnery sergeants than sergeants major. One of the major {{differences between the two}} E-9 ranks is that master gunnery sergeants retain their Military Occupational Specialty (MOS), while sergeants major are given a new MOS to reflect their general command focus. This reinforces the master gunnery sergeant's role as a provider of technical <b>military</b> <b>leadership.</b>|$|E
5|$|Manekshaw rose {{to be the}} 8th COAS of the Indian Army in 1969, {{and under}} his command Indian forces {{conducted}} successful campaigns against Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 {{that led to the}} Liberation of Bangladesh in December 1971. The decisive results achieved by the Indian Army during this war, under the able <b>military</b> <b>leadership</b> of Manekshaw, gave the nation a new sense of confidence, and in recognition of his services, in January 1973 the president of India conferred the rank of field marshal on him. Later, he was also awarded the Padma Vibhushan and the Padma Bhushan, the second and third highest Indian civilian awards respectively, for his services to the Indian nation.|$|E
5|$|Operation Dragoon was {{controversial}} {{from the}} time it was first proposed. The American <b>military</b> <b>leadership</b> and its British counterparts disagreed on the operation. Winston Churchill argued against it {{on the grounds that it}} diverted military resources that were better deployed for Allied operations in Italy; instead, he favored an invasion of the oil-producing regions of the Balkans. Churchill reasoned that by attacking the Balkans, the Western Allies could deny Germany petroleum, forestall the advance of the Red Army of the Soviet Union, and achieve a superior negotiating position in post-war Europe, all at a stroke.|$|E

5000|$|... 68% of indictees {{have been}} Serbs (or Montenegrins), {{to the extent}} that a {{sizeable}} portion of the Bosnian Serb and Croatian Serb political and <b>military</b> <b>leaderships</b> have been indicted. Many have seen this as reflecting bias, while the Tribunal's defenders have seen this as indicative of the actual proportion of crimes committed. However, Marko Hoare claimed that, aside from Milošević, only Momčilo Perišić (Chief of the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army), who was acquitted, has been indicted from the Serbian military or political top when it comes to wars in Croatia and Bosnia.|$|R
5|$|Rolling Thunder {{had begun}} as a {{campaign}} of psychological and strategic persuasion, but it changed very quickly to interdiction, a tactical mission. Its ultimate failure had two sources, both of which lay with the civilian and military policy-makers in Washington: first, neither group could ever conceive that the North Vietnamese would endure under the punishment that they would unleash upon it. The civilians, moreover, did not understand air power {{well enough to know}} that their policies might be crippling it; second, the American <b>military</b> <b>leadership</b> failed to initially propose and develop, or later to adapt, an appropriate strategy for the war.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army {{had entered}} the Second World War with {{inadequate}} resources due to severe cutbacks {{at the hands of}} conservative governments in the 1920s and 1930s. This was compounded by a lack of interest and appreciation of logistics on the part of its civilian and <b>military</b> <b>leadership.</b> There was an assumption that the Australian Army would form part of an expeditionary force that would fight overseas in a larger British force. This was indeed the case in the Great War, and again in the Second World War in the Middle East and Malaya, but not in SWPA, where the Australian Army not only had to provide its own logistic support, but support to its Allies as well.|$|E
5|$|The later German monuments {{constructed}} by the Nazi government were substantial, but communicated a limited range of symbolic messages, focusing on German heroism, conservative nationalism sentiments and masculinity. Use of mass graves symbolised the sense of German community. When Paul von Hindenburg died in 1935, the Tannenberg Memorial was then used as his mausoleum, commemorating elite <b>military</b> <b>leadership</b> during the war. The Nazi government attempted to have the Jewish names removed from the war memorials, but this proved impractical and instead a law was passed forbidding their addition to any future memorials. The government also removed more experimental earlier war memorials which were felt to communicate an inappropriate message about the war, such {{as the work of}} Ernst Barlach.|$|E
5000|$|The {{variable}} {{political history}} of Pakistan shows the country being ruled alternately by the civilian and <b>military</b> <b>leaderships.</b> This {{lack of political}} succession has had its effects {{on the way the}} history was depicted in the curricula of Pakistan Studies until 2006, which increasingly portrayed what Rubina Saigol termed as 'glorification of military'. However, the occasional attempts to alter the historical texts did not escape criticisms from the academics and scholars in Pakistan and abroad. Historian Ayesha Jalal in her 1995 article also raised concerns over the trends of official historiography in Pakistan's history textbooks.|$|R
5000|$|As all cadets are {{commissioned}} {{as second}} lieutenants and ensigns {{in the technical}} services upon graduation, <b>military</b> and <b>leadership</b> education is nested with academic instruction in the following specialties and subjects: ...|$|R

5|$|Under the {{guidance}} of General Hermann Balck, the cities of Zhytomyr and Korosten were retaken in mid-November, but after receiving reinforcements Vatutin resumed the offensive on 24 December 1943, and the Red Army continued its successful advance. Manstein's repeated requests to Hitler for more reinforcements were turned down. On 4 January 1944 Manstein met with Hitler {{to tell him that}} the Dnieper line was untenable and that he needed to retreat in order to save his forces. Hitler refused, and Manstein again requested changes in {{the highest levels of the}} <b>military</b> <b>leadership,</b> but was turned down, as Hitler believed that he alone was capable of managing the wider strategy.|$|E
5|$|Walter Ohmsen (7 June 1911 – 19 February 1988) was {{a highly}} {{decorated}} Oberleutnant zur See in the Kriegsmarine during World War II. On 6 June 1944 the Western Allies launched Operation Overlord, the amphibious invasion of Normandy, France. Ohmsen was the first German defender of Fortress Europe to sight the invasion force. His battery engaged in heavy fighting and subsequently Ohmsen was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) {{for the defense of}} the Crisbecq Battery against the American 4th Infantry Division, which landed on Utah Beach. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recognised extreme battlefield bravery or successful <b>military</b> <b>leadership.</b>|$|E
5|$|Also to this end, and {{to provide}} more {{professional}} <b>military</b> <b>leadership,</b> Diocletian separated military from civil command at the lowest, provincial level. Governors of provinces on the frontiers were stripped of command of the troops stationed there in favour of purely military officers called duces limitis ("border commanders"). Some 20 duces may have been created under Diocletian. Most duces were given command of forces in a single province, but a few controlled more than one province e.g. the dux Pannoniae I et Norici. However, at higher echelons, military and administrative command remained united in the vicarii and praefecti praetorio. In addition, Diocletian completed {{the exclusion of the}} senatorial class, still dominated by the Italian aristocracy, from all senior military commands and from all top administrative posts except in Italy.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} deciding factor in a battle at night is preparation. This includes training, reconnaissance, and planning. As with any <b>military</b> operation, <b>leadership</b> is important in both the high-ranking officers and the low-level squad and unit leaders.|$|R

50|$|On 14 December 2006, Wolfgramm and Mataitoga {{were also}} {{taken to the}} {{military}} camp and detained for questioning whereupon Wolfgramm had his passport confiscated and was informed of his deportation to Australia. Wolfgramm's deportation was not followed through and his passport was returned to him through the Office of the Fiji Human Rights Commission on 5 January 2007. The FDP had been refusing to accept Military interference in its publications {{in the wake of}} the military coup which deposed the Qarase-led SDL government on 5 December 2006.
