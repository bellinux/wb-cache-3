Its chassis was engineered to be mine-resistant and blastproof, allowing it to survive multiple TM-46 detonations during trials. The G6 was conceived as a wheeled rather than a tracked vehicle for this purpose, as well as to allow it to deploy long distances by road without consuming excessive quantities of fuel or requiring a tank transporter.|$|R
50|$|In agriculture, a sprayer is a {{piece of}} {{equipment}} that is used to apply herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers on agricultural crops. Sprayers range in size from man-portable units (typically backpacks with spray guns) to trailed sprayers that are connected to a tractor, to <b>self-propelled</b> <b>units</b> similar to tractors, with boom mounts of 60-151 feet in length.|$|R
50|$|Under the 1941 scheme, when divisional antitank battalions were {{converted}} to tank destroyers, they were renumbered. Those from infantry divisions received a number in the 600 range, those from armored divisions in the 700s, and those from field artillery in the 800s. Towed and <b>self-propelled</b> <b>units</b> were often noted by (T) or (SP) being appended to the number.|$|R
50|$|The Joint Mobile Offshore Base (JMOB) was a MOB {{concept for}} expeditionary warfare and {{humanitarian}} and commercial operations {{developed in the}} 1990s by McDermott International, Inc. of Arlington, Virginia.

It was deemed impractical, and in 1943 was canceled by Albert Speer. It never left the drawing board and no progress was made. It would have surpassed the Panzer VIII Maus (heaviest tank ever built) and the Landkreuzer P. 1000 Ratte (never built) in weight and size.|$|R

25|$|Despite the {{performance}} advantages, {{it turned out}} that no branch of the US Army wanted the new gun. The Infantry considered it too large and heavy. The other possible user, the Tank Destroyer Center, preferred more <b>mobile</b> <b>self-propelled</b> weapons. Finally, pressure from the head of Army Ground Forces, Gen. Lesley McNair, resulted in the gun being adopted by the TD Center. McNair's opinion was apparently influenced by the experience of the North African Campaign, where self-propelled guns were found to be hard to conceal.|$|R

25|$|For {{advanced}} {{training as a}} <b>self-propelled</b> <b>unit,</b> the battalion first moved to Camp Hood, Texas, on 3 March 1943. The battalion moved back to Camp Swift on 14 June 1943 and participated in the Third Army Maneuvers in Louisiana from September to November 1943, then returned to Camp Swift. On 20 December 1943, the battalion was reorganized as a towed battalion utilizing 3 inch guns and on 26 March 1944 traveled to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, arriving on 29 March 1944. The battalion embarked on the Ile de France, on 5 April 1944, at the New York Port of Embarkation, and sailed on 7 April 1944.|$|R
50|$|Airborne threats can be countered {{in several}} ways. One is air supremacy. This {{is what the}} United States relies on most, which is {{demonstrated}} by their distinct lack of effective short-range, mobile air defence vehicles to accompany armoured units. Most other countries accompany their armoured forces with highly <b>mobile</b> <b>self-propelled</b> anti-aircraft guns such as the German Gepard or the Soviet 9K22 Tunguska, short and medium-range surface-to-air missile systems such as the SA-6, SA-8 and SA-11, or combine both on the same vehicle (the Tunguska for example can also host SA-19 SAM missiles). The usage of anti-aircraft rounds fired from the main gun of a tank has been increasing over the years. An example is the HE-FRAG round from the T-90 which can be detonated at a set distance as determined by its laser range finder.|$|R
40|$|Collective {{behavior}} of active matter is observed for self-propelled particles, such as vibrated disks and active Brownian particles, {{as well as}} for cytoskeletal filaments in motile cells. Here, a system of quasi two-dimensional penetrable self-propelled rods inside rigid rings is used to construct a complex self-propelled particle. The rods interact sterically {{with each other and with}} a stationary or mobile ring via a separation-shifted Lennard-Jones potential. They either have a sliding attachment to the inside of the ring at one of their ends, or can move freely within the ring confinement. We study the inner structure and dynamics of the <b>mobile</b> <b>self-propelled</b> rings. We find that these complex particles cannot only be characterized as active Brownian particles, but can also exhibit cell-like motility: random walks, persistent motion, circling, and run-and-circle motion...|$|R

500|$|The 827th Tank Destroyer Battalion was {{activated}} on April 20, 1942, at Camp Forrest, Tennessee, {{one of five}} such battalions {{created that}} year.

It finally returned to a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>unit,</b> equipped with M18 Hellcats. At no point during this constant reshuffling did the unit ever receive a full allocation of equipment. At the same time, the original officer cadre was replaced twice—first with black officers, then with white officers from other disbanded segregated battalions. By the time the battalion sailed overseas, it had seen eight separate commanding officers.|$|R
50|$|The most {{significant}} employment of tank destroyers in Normandy was in early August, {{at the battle}} of Mortain, where the 823rd Tank Destroyer Battalion (towed 3-inch guns) was on the defensive alongside the 30th Infantry Division. The division, which was in temporary positions and not prepared for a defensive engagement, was attacked by elements of four panzer divisions on 6 August, under heavy fog. The 823rd put up a strong defense—knocking out fourteen tanks—but took heavy losses, being mostly overrun and losing eleven guns. This served to reinforce misgivings about the effectiveness of the towed units, and a report delivered to the Pentagon in December recommended they be phased out in favor of <b>self-propelled</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are various}} types of trains that are {{designed}} for particular purposes. A train may consist {{of a combination of}} one or more locomotives and attached railroad cars, or a <b>self-propelled</b> multiple <b>unit</b> (or occasionally a single or articulated powered coach, called a railcar). The first trains were rope-hauled, gravity powered or pulled by horses. From the early 19th century almost all were powered by steam locomotives. From the 1910s onwards the steam locomotives began to be replaced by less labor-intensive and cleaner (but more complex and expensive) diesel locomotives and electric locomotives, while {{at about the same time}} <b>self-propelled</b> multiple <b>unit</b> vehicles of either power system became much more common in passenger service.|$|R

25|$|The first diesel {{locomotive}} {{to operate in}} regular service in Michigan arrived in 1938. It was Grand Trunk Western 7800 an EMC SC switching locomotive to work in Detroit. Previously in 1925 GTW acquired from EMC an early motorized gas-electric railcar known as a Doodlebug. The cars were <b>self-propelled</b> <b>units</b> resembling a passenger car with a baggage compartment and a coach section for passengers that GTW used on its Detroit to Port Huron and Richmond to Jackson routes until 1953. GTW also had another gas-electric locomotive {{referred to as a}} box-cab built by Brill in 1926. Originally built for the Long Island Rail Road, GTW purchased it in 1934 and numbered it 7730. It was relegated to loading and unloading freight cars from GTW ferries in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The unit was eventually converted to diesel power in 1939 and served in Milwaukee until 1960.|$|R
