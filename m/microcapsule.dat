Selected <b>microcapsules</b> were assessed for long-term inductive properties with xenotransplantation into Sprague-Dawley rat ears. Both barium and calcium <b>microcapsules</b> maintained xenogenic dermal papilla cells in an immunoisolated environment and induced the formation of hair follicle structures. Calcium <b>microcapsules</b> showed better biocompatibility, permeability, and cell viability in comparison with barium <b>microcapsules.</b> Before 18 weeks, calcium <b>microcapsules</b> gathered together, with no substantial immune response. After 32 weeks, some <b>microcapsules</b> were near inflammatory cells and wrapped with fiber. A few large hair follicles were found.

50|$|Microencapsulation {{can be used}} to {{slow the}} release of a drug into the body. This may permit one {{controlled}} release dose to substitute for several doses of non-encapsulated drug and also may decrease toxic side effects for some drugs by preventing high initial concentrations in the blood. There is usually a certain desired release pattern. In some cases, it is zero-order, i.e. the release rate is constant. In this case, the microcapsules deliver a fixed amount of drug per minute or hour during the period of their effectiveness. This can occur as long as a solid reservoir or dissolving drug is maintained in the <b>microcapsule.</b> A more typical release pattern is first-order in which the rate decreases exponentially with time until the drug source is exhausted.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with tackling three major challenges of melamine formaldehyde (MF) <b>microcapsules</b> for delivering of core materials: reducing the formaldehyde content in the formulation, modulate the mechanical properties and reducing the leakage of the core material through the <b>microcapsules.</b> Thus, to reduce the formaldehyde content in the <b>microcapsules,</b> a low formaldehyde to melamine (F/M) molar ratio (0. 20 - 0. 49) compared to the conventional literature formulations (2. 30 - 5. 50) was used to produce the MF <b>microcapsules</b> in this study. It was found {{that there is a}} relatively small window of F/M molar ratio between 0. 20 and 0. 49 in which the wall thickness and nominal rupture stress of the <b>microcapsules</b> can be modulated significantly. Above 0. 49 increases in F/M molar ratios only increase these properties marginally. Furthermore, to reduce the leakage of the <b>microcapsules,</b> organic/inorganic double shell composite <b>microcapsules</b> with MF/copolymer as the inner shell, and ripened CaCO_ 3 nanoparticles as the outer shell were produced. A 20 fold reduction in leakage was observed between the double shell composite <b>microcapsules</b> and the MF <b>microcapsules</b> by the end of 24 hours, and it was also found that the mechanical properties of these double shell composite <b>microcapsules</b> are dominated by the CaCO_ 3 nanoparticles outer wall. Finally, calcium shellac matrix containing MF <b>microcapsules</b> and unripened CaCO_ 3 nanoparticulate <b>microcapsules</b> (complex capsules) were also produced to reduce the leakage. A 37 fold leakage reduction between calcium shellac matrix containing MF <b>microcapsules</b> and MF <b>microcapsules</b> alone by the end of 20 days was observed, and a 14 fold reduction was found between calcium shellac containing unripened CaCO 3 nanoparticulate <b>microcapsules</b> and the unripened CaCO_ 3 nanoparticulate <b>microcapsules</b> alone.

50|$|This {{process has}} been {{demonstrated}} with dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) and Grubbs' catalyst (benzylidene-bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)dichlororuthenium). Both DCPD and Grubbs' catalyst are imbedded in an epoxy resin. The monomer on its own is relatively unreactive and polymerization does not take place. When a microcrack reaches both the capsule containing DCPD and the catalyst, the monomer is released from the core-shell <b>microcapsule</b> and comes in contact with exposed catalyst, upon which the monomer undergoes ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). The metathesis reaction of the monomer involves the severance of the two double bonds in favor of new bonds. The presence of the catalyst allows for the energy barrier (energy of activation) to be lowered, and the polymerization reaction can proceed at room temperature. The resulting polymer allows the epoxy composite material to regain 67% of its former strength.|$|E

An illustrative example is the Hypercolor fashion, where microcapsules with crystal violet lactone, weak acid, and a dissociable salt dissolved in dodecanol are applied to the fabric; when the solvent is solid, the dye exists in its lactone leuco form, while when the solvent melts, the salt dissociates, the pH inside the <b>microcapsule</b> lowers, the dye becomes protonated, its lactone ring opens, and its absorption spectrum shifts drastically, therefore it becomes deeply violet.

50|$|Basically, three {{traditional}} methods of enzyme immobilization can be distinguished: binding to a support(carrier), entrapment (encapsulation) and cross-linking. Support binding can be physical, ionic, or covalent in nature. However, physical bonding is generally too weak to keep the enzyme fixed to the carrier under industrial conditions of high reactant and product concentrations and high ionic strength. The support can be a synthetic resin, a biopolymer or an inorganic polymer such as (mesoporous) silica or a zeolite. Entrapment involves inclusion of an enzyme in a polymer network (gel lattice) such as an organic polymer or a silica sol-gel, or a membrane device such as a hollow fiber or a <b>microcapsule.</b> Entrapment requires the synthesis of the polymeric network {{in the presence of}} the enzyme. The third category involves cross-linking of enzyme aggregates or crystals, using a bifunctional reagent, to prepare carrier-free macroparticles.|$|E

50|$|The {{reasons for}} {{microencapsulation}} are countless. It is mainly used {{to increase the}} stability and life of the product being encapsulated, facilitate the manipulation of the product and control its liberation in an adequate time and space.
