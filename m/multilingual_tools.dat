We run experiments with the TAC 2008 and 2009 data sets (English corpora for summarization research), and we obtained very promising results; at TAC 2009 our runs attained top rank for linguistic quality and second best for overall responsiveness. We also run a small-scale evaluation on languages other than English, demonstrating thereby the multilinguality of our approach, but also providing interesting evidence that contradicts the pervasive assumption “if it works for English, it works for any language”. Finally, we present an online system currently under development which will eventually incorporate all the elements of the summarization approach discussed hereby and we show sample output summaries in various languages.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new lexicographic resource, the MuLeXFoR database, {{which aims to}} present word-formation processes in a multilingual environment. Morphological items represent a real challenge for lexicography, especially {{for the development of}} <b>multilingual</b> <b>tools.</b> Affixes can take part in several word-formation rules and, conversely, rules can be realised by means of a variety of affixes. Consequently, {{it is often difficult to}} provide enough information to help users understand the meaning(s) of an affix or familiarise with the most frequent strategies used to translate the meaning(s) conveyed by affixes. In fact, traditional dictionaries often fail to achieve this goal. The database introduced in this paper tries to take advantage of recent advances in electronic implementation and morphological theory. Word-formation is presented as a set of multilingual rules that users can access via different indexes (affixes, rules and constructed words). MuLeXFoR entries contain, among other things, detailed descriptions of morphological constraints and productivity notes, which are sorely lacking in currently available tools such as bilingual dictionaries...|$|E

40|$|Compounding is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} for many languages, especially those with a rich morphology. Dealing with compounds is a challenge for the natural language processing (NLP) systems since compounds are not often included in the dictionaries and other lexical sources.

Due to the usage of language independent features, the method {{can be applied to}} different languages. We report on our experiments in splitting of German and Russian compound words, giving positive results compared to matching of compound parts in a lexicon.

40|$|Abstract. BalkaNet is an EC funded project (IST- 2000 - 29388) {{that started}} in September 2001 and will end in August 2004. It aims at {{developing}} [109] aligned wordnets for the following Balkan languages: Bulgarian, Greek, Romanian, Serbian, Turkish and to extend the Czech wordnet previously developed in the EuroWordNet project. BalkaNet project has insofar delivered many useful results {{in the fields of}} both Computational Lexicography and Natural Language Processing. However, most of these results have been only partially disseminated in different conferences and journals. This is the first attempt to provide an overall description of the findings, methodologies and results of the project as well as a detailed account on each monolingual wordnet. The paper also presents the freeware <b>multilingual</b> <b>tools</b> designed for the development, maintenance and efficient exploitation of the aligned BalkaNet wordnets. A preliminary approach on BalkaNet’s application towards indexing Web documents and Information Retrieval is described, following the consideration that semantic networks are valuable in the context of real world systems and user communities. Last but not least, a rather thorough analyses of wordnet applications over the last years is intended to put in evidence the hottest themes for further developments based on wordnets. The ultimate objective of this contribution is to spread the knowledge and experience that we have acquired, to the benefit of the research and industrial communities. We also hope that our shared experience will be helpful for other wordnet-builders. 10 D. Tufi¸s, D. Cristea, S. Stamou 1...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} about the information-seeking {{behavior}} that bilingual users – specifically, native Chinese speakers whose second language is English - exhibit when performing an online search. Bilingual online searching occurs when bilingual users submit queries to search for information in two languages. This study seeks to explore the information-seeking behavior of bilingual users {{in an attempt to}} discover possible ways of improving bilingual users’ online searching experience. The study focuses on defining the characteristics of bilingual users’ information-seeking behavior on the web. This research employed questionnaire and interview methods to determine (1) The information-seeking behavior of bilingual users; (2) Language’s influence on online searching; (3) Bilingual users’ opinions on the online searching support they need. The sample was recruited from Chinese native-speaking students in Pittsburgh. The researcher found that bilingual users tend to select the language that best fits their information needs rather than doing multilingual online searching and that they used search engines as <b>multilingual</b> <b>tools.</b> The researcher also identified five types of search strategies preferred for bilingual online searching. They include: directly linking, keyword searching, browsing, comparison, and externally linking. Directly linking means that the participant has a specific website in mind so he/she just go to the website directly or search for the website in the search engine. Browsing means that they retrieved a list of resources first and browse through them. Comparison means that they obtained several search results first and compare them. Externally linking strategy means that participants link from the website they accessed originally. This is a descriptive study of users completing four specific tasks and it only emphasizes on users’ opinions about the search support given by the bilingual online searching interface. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The task of {{cultural}} heritage preservation {{is a major}} endeavor that has political, economic and societal, {{in addition to the}} cultural implications. It requires the active participation of many stakeholders and needs to be founded on scientific grounds with attention to privacy/ethical issues. We argue that Information Technology, if utilized properly, can {{play an important role in}} the cultural heritage preservation by serving as a tool that can aid the process in many ways[7]. It allows better, cheaper and longer term preservation of archival material in digital form. This applies to printed matter as well as to multimedia objects (voice, pictures, video). The Internet allows access, independent of distance, both to reach the archival materials and to contribute objects. Access/modification can be controlled/regulated/monitored with minimal human effort. Virtual tours/exhibits, better annotation, and multilingual support can improve reachability to larger audiences. Presentation methods employing computer graphics/multimedia/Virtual Reality and GIS tools can help better querying and digestion of data. IT offers new cooperation possibilities in cultural heritage preservation such as crowd sourcing which helps the democratization of the process by allowing more people to contribute even in small ways, while still observing strict safeguards. Storage distribution and mirroring help smooth access and guard against interruptions/bottlenecks/failures, technical and otherwise; The open access culture of the Internet is an impediment to restrictive practices by custodians, while still giving the tools to preserve the privacy of individuals. Reductions in storage and bandwidth costs, better connectivity and the increase in computational power of devices and the ubiquitous nature of computing as well as the pervasiveness of <b>multilingual</b> <b>tools</b> for Information Retrieval are all factors that contribute to a better integration of IT resources into the cultural heritage preservation effort. IT, however, comes at a cost: better access also means more frequent malicious access attempts; misinterpreting the role of IT as an end rather than a tool and IT workers as policy setters rather than implementers; lax treatment of the real artifacts on the assumption that digital objects are a substitute; plus the usual failures that plague IT systems: deployment delays, bugs, unclear access rights management and the dominance of technical issues at the expense of scientific/cultural aspects of the work. We argue that digital, or IT-enabled preservation {{of cultural}} heritage, is here to stay, due to its economic, technical, cultural and societal advantages[7, 8]. We claim that in the Palestinian context IT may allow for preserving aspects of Palestinian Cultural Heritage, which are while endangered, may not be the focus of a critical mass of researchers/entities.
