5|$|Despite the Interior Department's {{rejection}} of the overall Rampart Dam project, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continued its engineering feasibility study on the project. That plan was completed on June 25, 1971, and it included most of the previous federal documents pertaining to the project, including the electricity <b>market</b> <b>studies</b> published by the Department of the Interior in 1965, the Fish and Wildlife study of 1964, and other studies about the economic feasibility of the project. A detailed description of potential construction methods and the overall plan for the project were included, as were reports about the site's geography and hydrology. In total, the report encompassed two volumes including more than 480 pages. Because the construction season at the site is only five months, the Corps of Engineers projected that several decades {{would be needed to}} build the dam and associated structures.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{following}} {{the launch of}} the wide-body 747, Boeing began considering further developments of its narrow-body 727 trijet. Designed for short and medium length routes, the three-engined 727 was the best-selling commercial jetliner of the 1960s and a mainstay of the U.S. domestic airline <b>market.</b> <b>Studies</b> focused on improving the 189-seat , the most successful 727 variant. Two approaches were considered: a stretched , and an all-new aircraft code-named 7N7. The former was a cheaper derivative using the 727's existing technology and tail-mounted engine configuration, while the latter was a twin-engine aircraft which made use of new materials and improvements to propulsion technology which had become available in the civil aerospace industry.|$|E

25|$|Data {{released}} by the Constitutional Courts indicated that the PS was the party with the largest budget, with almost 996,000 Euros in its war-chest, followed by the PSD, with 651,000 Euros, while the PPM was the group with the smallest budget, with only 3,000 Euros. It was anticipated that the PS would spend 261,000 Euros in its campaign; followed by the CDU, with 65,000 Euros; and the CDS-PP, with 61,000 Euros, while the PPM little more than 1,450 Euros. The Platforma de Cidadania (the alliance between the PPM and PND), with a global budget of 48,000 Euros, dedicated {{the majority of their}} cash reserves to public relation firms and <b>market</b> <b>studies</b> (where they spent 26,000 Euros). For the PSD, which received 350,633 Euros of state subsidies, the highest expenditure item, 180,000 Euros, was devoted to purchase giveaways and other offers. For its part the PDA, the only national party with their headquarters in the Azores, expected to spend 8,000 Euros, with 5,000 Euros for posters and pamphlets in order to elect their first parliamentary seat.|$|E

2500|$|Ambient conditions, such as lighting, {{temperature}} and music, are {{also part of}} the overall retail environment. It is common for a retail store to play music that relates to their target <b>market.</b> <b>Studies</b> have found that [...] "positively valenced music will stimulate more thoughts and feeling than negatively valenced music", hence, positively valenced music will make the waiting time feel longer to the customer than negatively valenced music. In a retail store, for example, changing the background music to a quicker tempo may influence the consumer to move through the space at a quicker pace, thereby improving traffic flow. Evidence also suggests that playing music reduces the negative effects of waiting since it serves as a distraction. Jewellery stores like Michael Hill have dim lighting with a view to fostering a sense of intimacy.|$|E
2500|$|On July 29, 2008, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia {{overturned}} the district court's decision allowing the merger.

The {{court ruled that}} [...] "mission driven" [...] consumers (those {{with an emphasis on}} social and environmental responsibility) would be adversely affected by the merger because substantial evidence by the FTC showed that Whole Foods intended to raise prices after consummation of the merger. As part of its effort to combat the ruling, Whole Foods subpoenaed financial records, <b>market</b> <b>studies</b> and future strategic plans belonging to New Seasons Market, a regional competitor based in the Portland area. In 2009 Whole Foods agreed to sell the Wild Oats chain.|$|E
2500|$|On March 17, Graham {{joined his}} finance {{minister}} Victor Boudreau {{to introduce the}} budget for the 2009-10 fiscal year. [...] The budget included $144 million in personal and corporate tax reductions and a pledge to lower taxes {{by a total of}} over $380 million over four years, and budget deficit of $741 million. [...] It centred around the so-called Plan for a Stronger Economy which included the tax cuts, a four-year plan to return the province to balanced budgets, the $1.2 billion in infrastructure spending previously announced in December, investments in priority areas with cuts in other areas to ensure [...] "responsible management" [...] of government expenditure. [...] Savings were released by instituting a two-year wage freeze for all government employees, the elimination of 700 civil service positions and the elimination of some services, most controversially the elimination of three ferries in the lower Saint John River Valley. Later there was also controversy surrounding some cuts to education services—despite an increase of funding to the education department, and a dispute with the province's physicians over their payment. The province's tax reforms attracted positive national attention, however, with the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, the National Post newspaper, and the Atlantic Institute for <b>Market</b> <b>Studies</b> all spoke on it favourably.|$|E

Though the initial shipment of 300,000 units sold {{out on the}} first day, Nintendo successfully avoided {{a repeat of the}} Super Famicom launch day pandemonium, in part by using a wider retail network which included convenience stores. In the months between the Japanese and North American launches, the Nintendo 64 saw brisk sales on the American grey market, despite import stores charging as much as $699 plus shipping for the system. The Nintendo 64 was first sold in North America on September 26, 1996, despite having been advertised for the 29th. It was launched with just two games in the United States, Pilotwings 64 and Super Mario 64. In 1994, prior to the launch, Nintendo of America chairman Howard Lincoln emphasized the quality of first-party games, saying [...] "... we're convinced that a few great games at launch are more important than great games mixed in with a lot of dogs". The PAL version of the console was released in Europe on March 1, 1997. According to Nintendo of America representatives, Nintendo had been planning a simultaneous launch in Japan, North America, and Europe, but <b>market</b> <b>studies</b> indicated that worldwide demand for the system far exceeded the number of units they could have ready by launch, potentially leading to consumer and retailer frustration.|$|E
