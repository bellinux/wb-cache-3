40|$|The Bass Basin forms {{part of the}} Southern Margin Rift System that {{developed}} {{as a result of}} the initial separation of Australia and Antarctica. The structural history of the Bass Basin differs from that of a classic extensional basin in that it was influenced by two major rifting events, one associated with the opening of the Southern Ocean (Southern Ocean Rifting) and the other with the opening of the Tasman Sea (Tasman Rifting). The structure and stratigraphy of the basin reflect the impact of both rifting events. A revised model for the structural development of the Bass Basin is proposed. Four important periods of structural development within the basin are: ○ possible Barremian extension associated with the closing phases of Southern Ocean Rifting; ○ Turonian to Campanian extension associated with Tasman Rifting; ○ Campanian to Early Eocene transtensional (wrenchrelated) reactivation of Tasman rift structures, and ○ Middle Tertiary reactivation. Current geothermal gradients within the Bass Basin are high, ranging from 33 °C/km (Pelican- 2) to 65 °C/km (Konkon- 1). Comparison of <b>maturity</b> <b>profiles</b> based on one dimensional thermal modelling with measured <b>maturity</b> <b>profiles</b> indicates that the Late Cretaceous to Recent sequence is experiencing maximum temperatures. Uplift relating to Oligocene to Miocene reactivation is restricted to the northern region of the basin (e. g. Cormorant Trough). Oligocene-Miocene deformation within central and southern regions was restricted to strike-slip reactivation of deep-seated basement involved structures. Assuming constant heat flow based on present-day values, source-rich horizons from the L. balmei to M. diversus intervals within the central depocentre regions of the Cormorant, Yolla and Pelican Troughs appear to have entered the oil expulsion window after deposition of the regional sealing unit, the Demons Bluff Formation. These source- rich horizons continued to pass through the oil expulsion window during and after Oligocene-Miocene reactivation events. An understanding of early rift geometries and subsequent changes in basin architecture and thermal conditions is central to defining new play concepts in this comparatively under-explored basin...|$|R

40|$|We {{study to}} what extent firms spread out their debt {{maturity}} dates across time, which we call "granularity of corporate debt. " We consider the role of debt granularity using a simple model in which a firm's inability to roll over expiring debt causes inefficiencies, such as costly asset sales or underinvestment. Since multiple small asset sales are less costly than a single large one, firms may diversify debt rollovers across maturity dates. We construct granularity measures using data on corporate bond issuers for the 1991 - 2011 period and establish a number of novel findings. First, there is substantial variation in granularity in that many firms have either very concentrated or highly dispersed maturity structures. Second, our model's predictions are consistent with observed variation in granularity. Corporate debt maturities are more dispersed for larger and more mature firms, for firms with better investment opportunities, with higher leverage ratios, and {{with lower levels of}} current cash flows. We also show that during the recent financial crisis especially firms with valuable investment opportunities implemented more dispersed maturity structures. Finally, granularity plays an important role for bond issuances, because we document that newly issued corporate bond maturities complement pre-existing bond <b>maturity</b> <b>profiles...</b>|$|R

Through a better understanding of the relationships between Performance Improvement Programmes and Organisational Maturity Variables, implementation success rates can increase, leading to improved results and sustainability. The approach taken to this research was quantitative in nature. Various descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to the selected respondents from the Eastern Cape automotive sector. The respondents had a working knowledge of Lean Manufacturing, Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) and Six Sigma. The research instrument was administered through an online survey. The research sought to identify whether there was a relationship amongst the variables under the three identified constructs. The research also sought to establish whether there was a difference between the specific Performance Improvement Programmes’ and Organisational Maturity Variables’ relationships. This affirmed the use of a new framework that integrates the programmes on the basis of their relationship to Organisational Maturity Variables. The research also provided insight into the challenges of the industry from a performance perspective and linked these with the relationship between Organisational Maturity Variables and Organisational Performance Variables. This allowed the researcher to include this additional insight as a consideration in the integrated implementation framework developed as part of the research. The results show that good consideration should be given to the Organisational Maturity Variables as these variables are related to the successful adoption of Performance Improvement Programmes.

40|$|Abstract. The {{existence}} of emergent semantics within social metadata (such as tags in bookmarking systems) {{has been proven}} by {{a large number of}} successful approaches making the implicit semantic structures explicit. However, much less attention has been given to the factors which influence the “maturing ” process of these structures over time. A natural hypothesis is that tags become semantically more and more mature whenever many users use them in the same contexts. This would allow to describe a tag by a specific and informative “semantic fingerprint ” in the context of tagged resoures. However, the question of assessing the quality of such fingerprints has been seldomly addressed. In this paper, we provide a systematic approach of mining semantic <b>maturity</b> <b>profiles</b> within folksonomy-based tag properties. Our ultimate goal is to provide a characterization of “mature tags”. Additionally, we consider semantic information about the tags as a gold-standard source for the characterization of the collected results. Our initial results suggest that a suitable composition of tag properties allows the identification of more mature tag subsets. The presented work has implications for a number of problems related to social tagging systems, including tag ranking, tag recommendation, and the capturing of light-weight ontologies from tagging data. ...|$|R

The workshops have developed from an initial educative and developmental focus for novice researchers, to one that now embodies more of a critical perspective, in which participants reflect upon and collectively discuss their own beliefs and understandings as educators and researchers within the NACCQ sector. This has required the development of specific self-assessment instruments. These include an instrument for assessing researcher maturity and a further instrument for self-assessment of paradigm preferences in curriculum development and research. Preliminary results from these self-assessments have been reported (Clear & Young, 2001) which give some insights into the understandings about research of computing educators and novice researchers in the sector. But developing and refining these self-assessment instruments is a continuing process. Since this self-assessment process has been undertaken as a means of actively modelling use of the critical method in research, determining forms of analysis that are consonant with this paradigm is a current issue for the authors.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Soybean is a short-day crop of agricultural, ecological, and {{economic}} importance. The sensitive photoperiod responses significantly limit its breeding and adaptation. GmFT 2 a, a putative florigen gene with different transcription profiles in two cultivars (late-maturing Zigongdongdou and early-maturing Heihe 27) with different <b>maturity</b> <b>profiles,</b> {{is key to}} flowering and maturation. However, up to now, {{its role in the}} diverse patterns of maturation in soybeans has been poorly understood. METHODS: Eighty varieties, including 19 wild accessions, covering 11 of all 13 maturity groups, were collected. They were planted in pots and maintained under different photoperiodicity conditions (SD, short day; LD, long day; and ND, natural day). The day to first flowering was recorded and the sensitivity to photoperiod was investigated. Polymorphisms in the GmFT 2 a coding sequence were explored by searching the known SNP database (NCBI dbSNP). The GmFT 2 a promoter regions were then cloned from these varieties and sequenced. Further polymorphism and association analyses were conducted. RESULTS: These varieties varied greatly in time to first flowering under ND and exhibited a consecutive distribution of photoperiod sensitivity, which suggested that there is rich diversity in flowering time. Furthermore, although GmFT 2 a had only one known synonymous SNP in the coding sequence, there were 17 haplotypes of the GmFT 2 a promoter region, HT 06 of which was extremely abundant. Further association analysis found some SNPs that might be associated with day to first flowering and photoperiod sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Although GmFT 2 a is a key flowering gene, GmFT 2 a polymorphism {{does not appear to be}} responsible for maturity diversity in soybean...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} whether <b>maturity,</b> anthropometric <b>profiles</b> {{and fitness}} measures {{vary according to}} birth date distribution in elite, under- 14 youth academy soccer players. The selection year was divided into four quarters, with 160 male players grouped according to individual birth date. Players had their skeletal age determined and were assessed using a battery of standard anthropometric and physical performance tests. Players born across all quarters of the year were investigated for differences in the various performance characteristics using multi- and univariate analyses. An uneven birth distribution was observed, with players born early in the selection year highly represented (P< 0. 01). A significant difference in height was observed across quarters (P< 0. 01) with higher values reported in the earlier-born players. No significant differences were observed across any of the fitness measures, although the trend was for players born {{in the first quarter}} to out-perform peers born in the later quarters. These findings suggest that the relative age of the performer may not always be linked to a significant advantage in physical components. The selection criteria for entry into the academy may explain the present results...|$|R
