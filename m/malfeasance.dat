5|$|As the 1880 presidential {{elections}} approached, many Democrats remained convinced Tilden had been robbed {{of the presidency}} in 1876. In the House, Tilden supporter Clarkson Nott Potter of New York sought {{an investigation into the}} 1876 election in Florida and Louisiana, hoping that evidence of Republican <b>malfeasance</b> would harm that party's candidate in 1880. The Democratic caucus, including Randall, unanimously endorsed the idea, and the committee convened in May 1878. Some in the caucus wished to investigate the entire election, but Randall and the more moderate members worked to limit the committee's reach to the two disputed states.|$|E

5|$|After graduation, Sawyer {{joined the}} law firm of Drinker Biddle & Reath, where he {{remained}} for his entire career. Shortly after joining the firm, he was assigned to work as a temporary assistant district attorney in the O'Malley Case, a prosecution of political corruption in the city (the Philadelphia district attorney's office at that time was mostly staffed by part-time employees drawn from firms as needed). Working under lead prosecutor Laurence Howard Eldredge and alongside assistant prosecutor Lemuel Braddock Schofield, Sawyer assisted in the trial of Chief Magistrate John J. O'Malley for 206 counts of <b>malfeasance</b> in office. O'Malley was found not guilty in two trials in 1948 and 1949. Sawyer was called back into the Navy in 1950 during the Korean War and later as a foreign service officer in Europe. He returned to Philadelphia in 1953.|$|E
5|$|As a result, Alfonsín {{sponsored}} the Trial of the Juntas, in which, {{for the first}} time, the leaders of a military coup in Argentina were on trial. The first hearings began at the Supreme Court in April 1985 and lasted {{for the remainder of}} the year. In December, the tribunal handed down life sentences for Jorge Videla and former Navy Chief Emilio Massera, as well as 17-year sentences for Roberto Eduardo Viola. President Leopoldo Galtieri was acquitted of charges related to the repression, but he was court-martialed in May 1986 for <b>malfeasance</b> during the Falklands War. Ramón Camps received a 25-year sentence. The trials did not focus only on the military: Mario Firmenich was captured in Brazil in 1984 and extradited to Argentina. José López Rega was extradited from Miami in 1986, because of his links with the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{vigorous}} political {{debate in the}} 1790s was sparked by the publication of Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France in November 1790. Most commentators in Britain expected Burke to support the French revolutionaries, because he had previously {{been part of the}} liberal Whig party, a critic of monarchical power, a supporter of the American revolutionaries, and a prosecutor of government <b>malfeasance</b> in India. When he failed to do so, it shocked the populace and angered his friends and supporters. Burke's book, despite being priced at an expensive three shillings, sold an astonishing 30,000 copies in two years. Thomas Paine's famous response, The Rights of Man (1792), which became the rallying cry for thousands, however, greatly surpassed it, selling upwards of 200,000 copies.|$|E
50|$|In March 2010, {{the staff}} of the {{magazine}} issued an open letter attacking new editor Li Chang for actions including: cancelling contracts with Chinese science fiction readers and authors; refusing to buy stories from authors, forcing the editors to write the stories themselves; ordering that foreign language editors do all translations into Chinese themselves instead of buying translations, and art editors create the illustrations themselves instead of hiring artists. He also interfered with advertising, replacing the magazine’s front cover with an advertisement for a school. All of these <b>malfeasances</b> were claimed as causes for the recent severe drop in SFW circulation, to a low of approximately 130,000. Investigations by China Youth Daily and others verified the accusations, and by 4 April Xinhua reported Li Chang's ouster. Later the problem was solved, and Yao Haijun became the deputy director of Science Fiction World.|$|R
5000|$|Sources {{state that}} he {{undertook}} anti-Nazi resistance {{work in the}} army without spelling out what this involved. However, his father was arrested in February 1942, sentenced in May 1942 and, on 15 September 1942, executed. [...] Three days later his mother was re-arrested and taken into custody. [...] Kurt Langendorfer himself was identified as [...] "politically unreliable" [...] and transferred to a Punishment squadron. [...] In July 1943, {{caught up in the}} Battle of Kursk, he attempted to cross over and join the Red Army. Langendorf was shot and rendered unconscious: after the front line had rolled back and forth for several days he was found by German soldiers and taken to the field hospital. The surgeon who extracted the bullet advised him to retain it: it came from a German revolver. [...] (It was only in much later, in 1990, that he discovered that army records of the time had reported him as dead.) By the end of 1944, after further military service, he found himself before a military court following further various <b>malfeasances</b> and was sentenced to a further five years in a Punishment squadron. One of his misdemeanours had been to announce to an aristocratic senior officer, during a training course for junior officers, that the Second World War would be won by Germany because Goebbels, the government propaganda minister, was the greater liar.|$|R
2500|$|In July 1843, his defense, Die Beschwerden und Klagen der Slaven in Ungarn über die gesetzwidrigen Übergriffe der Magyaren ("The {{complaints}} and grievances of the Slavs in Hungary about the illegal <b>malfeasances</b> of the Hungarians"), which editorial offices throughout 19th century Hungary {{had refused to}} publish, was published in Leipzig, Germany. From 11 to 16 July 1843, at the parish house of J. M. Hurban in Hlboké, {{the leaders of the}} Slovak national movement – Štúr, J. M. Hurban, and M.M. Hodža – agreed on how to codify the new Slovak language standard and how to introduce it to the public. On 17 July 1843, they visited Ján Hollý, an important writer and representative of the older Bernolák Slovak language standard, in Dobrá Voda and informed him about their plans. On 11 October 1843, although the committee did not find anything illegal about Štúr's activities, Štúr was ordered to stop lecturing and was removed from the function of deputy for Prof. Palkovič. However, Štúr continued to give lectures. On 31 December 1843, he was definitively deprived of the function of deputy for Prof. Palkovič. As a result, in March 1844, 22 students left Pressburg in protest; 13 of them went to study at the Evangelical Lýceum in the town of Levoča. One of the supporting students was Janko Matuška, who took the opportunity to write a hymn, [...] "Nad Tatrou sa blýska", which later became the official anthem of the Slovak Republic.|$|R
5|$|After Dorgon's {{death on}} the last day of 1650, the Shunzhi Emperor started his {{personal}} rule: he ordered the members of the Council to memorialize to him directly on important matters of state. After Dorgon's supporters had been purged from the court (by March 1651), his former co-regent Jirgalang made a number of special appointments to the Council to foster loyalty among the Manchu elite. Between 1651 and 1653, he added thirty new members who lacked official positions in the Banners or the metropolitan bureaucracy. Two of the new appointees were Chinese Bannermen Fan Wencheng 范文程 (1597–1666) and Ning Wanwo 寗完我 (d. 1665), two of only three Chinese who were ever appointed to the Council. All four of the future regents for the Kangxi Emperor (Oboi, Suksaha, Ebilun, and Soni) were also appointed to the Council at that time. In 1656, the emperor issued an edict abolishing the automatic appointment to the Council of Manchu and Mongol Grand Secretaries, yet by the end of his reign in 1661, the Council still counted more than fifty members. During the Shunzhi reign, the Council was often convened to investigate important officials who had been accused of corruption or <b>malfeasance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite Arnold's successes, he {{was passed}} over for {{promotion}} by the Continental Congress, while other officers claimed credit for some of his accomplishments. Adversaries in military and political circles brought charges of corruption or other <b>malfeasance,</b> but most often he was acquitted in formal inquiries. Congress investigated his accounts and concluded that he was indebted to Congress (he also {{had spent much of}} his own money on the war effort). Arnold was frustrated and bitter at this, {{as well as with the}} alliance with France and the failure of Congress to accept Britain's 1778 proposal to grant full self-governance in the colonies. He decided to change sides, and opened secret negotiations with the British. In July 1780, he was awarded command of West Point. His scheme was to surrender the fort to the British, but it was exposed when American forces captured British Major John André carrying papers which revealed the plot. Upon learning of André's capture, Arnold fled down the Hudson River to the British sloop-of-war Vulture, narrowly avoiding capture by the forces of George Washington, who had been alerted to the plot.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic party {{continued}} {{to criticize the}} Sangkum and Sihanouk in their newspaper, much to Sihanouk's consternation. In August 1957 Sihanouk finally lost patience, calling out Democrat leaders for a debate. Five of them attended. At the debate, held at the royal palace, Sihanouk spoke in a belligerent tone, challenging the Democrat leaders to present evidence of <b>malfeasance</b> in his government and inviting them to join the Sangkum. The Democrat leaders gave hesitant responses, and according to American historian David P. Chandler, it gave the audience {{the impression that they}} were disloyal to the monarchy. The debate led to the effective demise of the Democratic party, as its leaders were subsequently beaten up by government soldiers, with Sihanouk's tacit approval. With the Democrats vanquished, Sihanouk focused on preparing for general elections, slated to be held in March 1958. He drafted left-wing politicians, including Hou Yuon, Hu Nim, and Chau Seng, to stand as Sangkum candidates, with a view to winning left-wing support from the Pracheachon. The Pracheachon on their part fielded five candidates for the elections. However, four of them withdrew, as they were prevented by the national police from holding any election rallies. When voting took place, the Sangkum won all seats in the national assembly.|$|E
6000|$|Of Hanbury's News-Letters from Foreign Courts, four or five, {{incidentally}} printed, {{are like}} {{the contents of a}} slop-pail; uncomfortable to the delicate mind. Not lies on the part of Hanbury, but foolish scandal poured into him; a man more filled with credulous incredible scandal, evil rumors, of <b>malfeasances</b> by kings and magnates, than most people known. His rumored mysteries between poor Polish Majesty and pretty Daughter-in-law (the latter a clever and graceful creature, Daughter of the late unfortunate Kaiser, and a distinguished Correspondent of Friedrich's) are to be regarded as mere poisoned wind. [See--Hanbury's Works,--ii. 209-240.] That [...] "Polish Majesty gets into his dressing-gown at two in the afternoon" [...] (inaccessible thenceforth, poor lazy creature), one most readily believes; but there, or pretty much there, one's belief has to stop. The stories, in WALPOLE, on the King of Prussia, have a grain of fact in them, twisted into huge irrecognizable caricature in the Williams optic-machinery. Much else one can discern to be, in essence, false altogether. Friedrich, who could not stand that intriguing, spying, shrewish, unfriendly kind of fellow at his Court, applied to England in not many months hence, and got Williams sent away: ["22d January, 1751" [...] (MS. LIST in State-Paper Office).] on to Russia, or I forget whither;--which did not mend the Hanbury optical-machinery on that side. The dull, tobacco-smoking Saxon-Polish Majesty, about whom he idly retails so many scandals, had never done him any offence.|$|R
30|$|Goethe reappears {{in one of}} {{the most}} celebrated {{passages}} in Volume 1 of Capital, a work that consists largely of many pages of careful, straightforward analysis, interlarded with some lengthy reports of British Parliamentary committee investigations into workers’ conditions and capitalist owners’ <b>malfeasances</b> (for example, in the bakery industry), but that occasionally breaks into short bursts of soaring rhetoric. The passage in question deals with the historical evolution from the preaching of abstinence and saving that characterized the speech and life-style of early capitalists, to the cult of consumption and luxury that were beginning, in Marx’s day, to dominate capitalism in its more “modernized” form. In his characteristically facetious way, Marx, having just cited a very lengthy passage from Martin Luther (1483 – 1546) in which Luther inveighs against usurers as the greatest enemies of mankind after the devil himself, says that original sin is, alas, to be found everywhere: the original sin is accumulation. Marx next cites two lines from Faust (Chapter 24, Section 3) about “two souls” dwelling within the same individual, opposing one another, and concludes by asserting that there is, in the capitalist’s breast, “a Faustian conflict between the [sordid] passion for accumulation, and the desire for enjoyment”. (This remains, incidentally, a fundamental conflict within contemporary capitalism – call it, in today’s language, the conflict between profit maximization and consumerism – that only gets resolved, if at all, in an ambivalent, compromising fashion). Marx then goes on, one paragraph later, to intone another line that has become very famous: “Accumulate! Accumulate! That is Moses and the Prophets!” ([1], p: 594 – 595). I shall return shortly to reflect on some of the philosophical and, as it were, theological implications of this text.|$|R
5000|$|During {{his tenure}} as Minister of Transportation, Băsescu oversaw {{privatization}} of Romania's merchant fleet. While some argued that the aging ships {{at the time were}} of minimal value, many Romanians believed the compensation received for the ships was artificially low. The [...] "scandal" [...] of the fleet sale became known in Romania as The Fleet File (Dosarul Flota) Affair. Prosecutors brought charges against Băsescu, but it was not proven that he was involved in any <b>malfeasances.</b> In 1996, Băsescu was the first Romanian parliamentarian to renounce his parliamentary immunity, in order to allow judicial procedures related to the Fleet File Affair to continue against him (Romanian MPs were, by default, granted immunity from prosecution of any kind). Although the case against him was closed at the time for lack of evidence, it was reopened in early 2004, in what some considered a political maneuver against him sponsored by the then PSD government. In 2004, the case was brought before the High Court of Cassation and Justice, however the judges decided to send it back to the Prosecutor's Office citing procedural errors (the signature of a prosecutor was missing). In December 2007, the Romanian National Anti-corruption Directorate (Direcția Națională Anticorupție), a subdivision of the General Prosecutor Office, ruled to end the investigation, based on the financial expertise that there was not prejudice from the association of Romanian NM Petromin SA Constanța with the Norwegian Torvald Klaveness Group (April 1991 - August 2000). However the case is still opened as this is only the latest expertise published and the only one who serves as evidence in favor of Băsescu. Some have seen this as a political maneuver destined to prove his innocence. In total 136 people were investigated, 80 of which, including Băsescu, were retained for the investigation of this case, while the facts pertaining to 51 others were separated for independent investigations.|$|R

Methods sociological absentee polling {{in the form of}} a questionnaire statistical logical documentary graphic method of systemic analysis. 	Results the opinions of the population on police are extremely controversial. It is connected mostly with the sources of information which mostly are not reliable and objective. 	The article shows that despite the growth of victimization the level of anxiety of the population about the criminal attacks is gradually reduced and the sense of security in citizens is strengthened though often due to their personal efforts to protect their life health and property. Only every fifth citizen relies on the participation of law enforcers in ensuring security and public order. The survey revealed that about half of the citizens who are potentially interested in the reaction of law enforcement officers to the crime actually agree to leave the offender unpunished due to the mistrust of the police. A third of claimants were unsatisfied with the police action on their application which does not correlate with the declared numbers. 	The opinion of Volgograd citizens on the frequency of bribery among police officers remains unchanged whereas other <b>malfeasances</b> received a significant increase. And despite this the attitude of the respondents towards the police in general has improved. Mostly it was the result of media activities that inform the public about successful police work using TV shows documentaries and feature films.
