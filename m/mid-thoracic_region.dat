40|$|Older large breed dogs, {{primarily}} of the German Shepherd type, may be presented with progressive ataxic spastic paresis. There {{seems to be}} no sex predominance. The lesion found on necropsy is diffuse degeneration of spinal cord myelin and axons in all fiber tracts, most extensive and in the <b>mid-thoracic</b> <b>region,</b> but not associated with intervertebral disc herniation, spondylosis, or osseous metaplasia of the dura. The condition is thought to be primary spinal cord degeneration of unknown cause...|$|E
40|$|Vertebral {{deformity}} is {{the classical}} hallmark of osteoporosis. Three types of vertebral deformity are usually described: crush, wedge and biconcave deformities. However, {{there are few}} data concerning the descriptive epidemiology of the individual deformity types, and differences in their underlying pathogenesis and clinical impact remain uncertain. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the epidemiological characteristics of the three types of vertebral deformity and to explore the relationships of the number and type of deformity with back pain and height loss. Age-stratified random samples of men and women aged 50 years and over were recruited from population registers in 30 European centers (EVOS study). Subjects were invited to attend for an interviewer-administered questionnaire and lateral spinal radiographs. The presence, type and number of vertebral deformities was determined using the McCloskey-Kanis algorithm. A total of 13, 562 men and women were studied; mean age in men was 64. 4 years (SD 8. 5), and in women 63. 8 years (SD 8. 5 years). There was evidence of variation in the occurrence of wedge, crush and biconcave deformity by age, sex and vertebral level. Wedge deformities were the most frequent deformity and tended to cluster at the <b>mid-thoracic</b> and thoraco-lumbar <b>regions</b> of the spine in both men and women. Similar predilection for these sites was observed for crush and to a lesser extent biconcave deformities though this was much less marked than for wedge deformities. In both sexes the frequency of biconcave deformities was higher in the lumbar than the thoracic spine and unlike the other deformity types it did not decline in frequency at lower lumbar vertebral levels. The prevalence of all three types of vertebral deformity increased with age and was more marked in women. There were no important differences in the effect of age on the different deformity types. All types of deformity were associated with height loss, which was greatest for individuals with crush deformity. Back pain was also associated with all types of deformity. Overall, these results do not suggest important differences in pathophysiology between the three deformity types. Biomechanical factors appear to be important in determining their distribution within the spine. All deformity types are linked with adverse outcomes, though crush deformities showed greater height loss than the other deformity types...|$|R
40|$|Spinal {{epidural}} angiolipomas are rare, benign tumors {{composed of}} mature lipocytes admixed with abnormal blood vessels. Only 128 cases of spinal epidural angiolipomas {{have been reported}} in literature till now. Spinal angiolipomas are predominantly located in the <b>mid-thoracic</b> <b>region.</b> We report a case of dorsal epidural angiolipoma in a 56 -year-old male who presented with paraparesis and was diagnosed to have D 4 - 5 epidural angiolipoma. Total surgical excision of the epidural angiolipoma was done and his paraparesis gradually improved...|$|E
40|$|Lung trauma {{has been}} {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the vital injuries induced by explosion-generated blast overpressure. Conflicting evidence exists as to whether nitric oxide plays a crucial role in acute lung injury induced by blast. Data presented in this study demonstrate that local exposure of <b>mid-thoracic</b> <b>region</b> to moderate-level blast overpressure significantly enhanced lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde and superoxide anion generation in rabbit’s lungs 30 minutes after exposure, whereas the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase) activity showed parallel increase. NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a non-specific inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), had no effects on the measured parameters suggesting that oxidative stress induced by blast exposure might be independent from NOS.

40|$|Spontaneous {{intracranial}} hypotension (SIH) {{is characterized}} by orthostatic headache (OH), low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, and diffuse pachymeningeal gadolinium enhancement (DPME). We present here the case studies of two patients. One patient demonstrated a CSF leak in the <b>mid-thoracic</b> <b>region,</b> and recovered completely with conservative treatment. The other patient in whom leak could not be demonstrated, developed dementia, rapidly worsening encephalopathy, and became comatose, necessitating urgent epidural blood patch (EBP) with 25 cc of autologous blood, after which immediate and complete symptomatic relief was obtained. A second EBP was required {{a few days later}} and also provided complete and sustained clinical benefit, without subsequent recurrence. Both patients had OH and showed bilateral subdural fluid collections, DPME and “sagging” of brain on MRI. A high index of suspicion, recognizing the orthostatic nature of headache, and typical findings on contrast enhanced MRI should point to the diagnosis of SIH. EBP can be effective treatment in patients unresponsive to conservative measures...|$|E
40|$|Sensory {{changes and}} lower limb {{reflexes}} {{were observed in}} 35 patients receiving segmental epidural analgesia in the <b>mid-thoracic</b> <b>region.</b> Sensory blockade was con-fined to the thoracic and upper lumbar segments. The lower limb reflexes changed to an "upper motor neurone " pattern, with the onset and development of segmental blockade. The sequence of changes observed was hypertonic tendon reflexes, then the onset of ankle clonus, and finally the plantar response changed to a positive Babinski sign. With regression of analgesia the reflexes returned to normal in the reverse order. The significance of these findings is discussed {{in relation to the}} anatomy of descend-ing spinal pathways, and to the pattern of penetration of local anaesthetics into the substance of the spinal cord. Coming's original attempts at spinal analgesia in 1885 were based on the concept that medications injected close to the cord would be taken up by the substance of the spinal cord (Corning, 1885).

40|$|Palpation for {{tenderness}} {{forms an}} important part of the manual therapy assessment for musculoskeletal dysfunction, In conjunction with other testing procedures it assists in establishing the clinical diagnosis. Tenderness in the thoracic spine has been reported in the literature as a clinical feature in musculoskeletal conditions where pain and dysfunction are located primarily in the upper quadrant. This study aimed to establish whether pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) of the <b>mid-thoracic</b> <b>region</b> of asymptomatic subjects were naturally lower than those of the cervical and lumbar areas. A within-subject study design was used to examine PPT at four spinal levels C 6, T 4, T 6, and L 4 in 50 asymptomatic volunteers. Results showed significant (P < 0. 001) regional differences. PPT values increased in a caudal direction. The cervical region had the lowest PPT scores, that is was the most tender. Values increased in the thoracic region and were highest in the lumbar region. This study contributes to the normative data on spinal PPT values and demonstrates that mid-thoracic tenderness relative to the cervical spine is not a normal finding in asymptomatic subjects.

40|$|Spinal angiolipomas are benign {{uncommon}} neoplasm {{composed of}} mature lipocytes admixed with abnormal blood vessels. They {{account for only}} 0. 04 – 1. 2 % of all spinal tumors. We report two cases of lumbar extradural angiolipoma and review previously reported cases. We found 118 cases of spinal epidural angiolipoma (70 females and 48 males; age range 1. 5 – 85  years, mean 44. 03) spanning from 1890 to 2006. Prior to diagnosis 40. 6 % of the patients had weakness of the lower limbs. The interval between the initial symptoms and tumor diagnosis ranged from 1  day to 17  years (mean 20. 2  months). Except for four cases diagnosed at autopsy, 109 patients underwent surgery and gross-total resection was performed in 79 cases (72. 4 %). Spinal angiolipomas are tumors containing angiomatous and lipomatous tissue, predominantly located in the <b>mid-thoracic</b> <b>region.</b> All angiolipomas show iso- or hyperintensity on T 1 -weighted images and hyperintensity on T 2 -weighted images and most lesions enhance with gadolinium administration. The treatment for spinal extradural angiolipomas is total surgical resection and no adjuvant therapy should be administered...|$|E
40|$|Idiopathic {{spinal cord}} {{herniation}} (ISCH), where {{a segment of}} the spinal cord has herniated through a ventral defect in the dura, is a rarely encountered cause of thoracic myelopathy. The purpose of our study was to increase the clinical awareness of this condition by presenting our experience with seven consecutive cases treated in our department since 2005. All the patients developed pronounced spastic paraparesis or Brown-Séquard syndrome for several years (mean, 4. 7 years) prior to diagnosis. MRI was consistent with a transdural spinal cord herniation in the <b>mid-thoracic</b> <b>region</b> in all the cases. The patients underwent surgical reduction of the herniated spinal cord and closure of the dural defect using an artificial dural patch. At follow-up, three patients experienced considerable clinical improvement, one had slight improvement, one had transient improvement, and two were unchanged. Two of the four patients with sphincter dysfunction regained sphincter control. MRI showed realignment of the spinal cord in all the patients. ISCH is probably a more common cause of thoracic myelopathy than previously recognized. The patients usually develop progressive myelopathy for several years before the correct diagnosis is made. Early diagnosis is important in order to treat the patients before the myelopathy has become advanced...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to radiologicaly {{estimate}} the width, height and depth of bodies of thoracic and lumbal vertebras. Charts of one hundred and seventeen patients with implanted internal fixateur on the thoracic and lumbal spine, between 01. 01. 2008. and 31. 3. 2010. at the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology - Clinical centre Sarajevo, were retrieved, and only 14 patients, with totally 46 vetrtebras have meet including criteria (clearly visible measured structures on X-ray and CT scans, and data about implants dimensions). Digitalized anteroposterior and laterolateral X ray, and transversal and sagital CT scans were basic inputs for measurement of height, width and depth of the vertebral body - CH, CW, CD. The correction of enlargement on X-ray pictures was performed according to known dimensions of implants and the length scale on CT scans. Enlargement of those parameters, from T 1 to L 5 spine level was from 60 to 100 %, except the stagnation in the <b>mid-thoracic</b> <b>region,</b> and decreasing of corporal depth on the L 5 vertebra (CD/L 5), {{in comparison to the}} fourth vertebra (CD/L 4). The clinical importance of this work is in estimation and comparison of dimensions of vertebral bodies measured on X ray and CT scans, as the basic inputs during surgical procedures of vertebroplasty and anterior spondilodesis...|$|E
40|$|Impulsive stimuli {{were used}} to evoke {{postural}} reflexes in healthy subjects (n = 10) and avestibular patients (n = 2). Electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded with subjects standing erect, feet together with eyes closed and leaning forward to activate their leg muscles. EMG was recorded bilaterally from over the soleus muscles, rectified and averaged. The evoked response was biphasic and consisted of a short latency (SL) and a smaller medium latency (ML) response, at approximately 60 and 80 ms post-stimulus, respectively. Reflex amplitude was expressed {{as a percentage of}} the prestimulus level. Stimulus rise times of 10 and 14 ms evoked the largest responses. SL responses were largest when stimulating at the vertebra prominens (C 7) or over the <b>mid-thoracic</b> <b>region</b> (C 7 : 56 ± 42 %, mid-thoracic: 56 ± 51 %). Positive (push) stimuli evoked larger responses than negative stimuli which evoked an initial inhibition (C 7 positive: 56 ± 42 %, C 7 negative: - 12 ± 5 %). Similarly, increasing intensity also produced larger responses (standard intensity: 56 ± 42 %; increased intensity: 80 ± 53 %). There was no apparent EMG response in the sitting condition, despite activation of calf muscles, indicating the reflex was dependent on posture. Avestibular patients had well-formed responses similar to normals (patients: SL = 137. 5 and 84. 5 %, ML = - 11. 6 and - 16. 2 %) with mildly prolonged latencies. This study has described the basic properties of a reflex evoked by impulsive accelerations of the trunk that we propose is not primarily dependent upon vestibular afferents and is likely to have a role in normal postural stability. A truncal origin of the receptors mediating the response best fits our observations and is an alternative explanation for some previous reports about postural reflexes in response to limb displacements. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Spinal cord {{compression}} by {{a mass of}} amyloid tissue {{arising from}} the thoracic verteb-rae is described in a 72 -year-old female. Investigations failed to provide a primary cause for-this amyloid tissue. In {{a review of the}} literature, only one case of spinal cord compression by an amyloid deposit has been found. ' Amyloidosis of the nervous system is known to cause peripheral neuropathy and autonomic dis-turbances due to direct involvement of peripheral nerves. 23 Multiple myeloma is known to cause para-plegia by extradural deposits and vertebral collapse. Compression of nerve roots by myelomatous tissue extending from contiguous bone have been described. Peripheral neuropathy which does not depend on compression of nervous structures by tumour tissue has also been well recognised both in cases of primary amyloidosis and multiple myeloma. 4 Progressive paraparesis due to a mass of amyloid tissue compressing the spinal cord has only recently been described. ' Case report A 72 -year-old female presented in July 1980 with progres-sive lower limb paraparesis and urinary retention during the past three weeks. She was anorectic and had lost 7 kg in weight. She had no pain. There was no relevant drug or family history and no history of chronic illness. She had lower limb weakness and a sensory deficit below the <b>mid-thoracic</b> <b>region</b> with urinary retention. Lower limb reflexes were brisk. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 50 mm/h; haemoglobin 11. 7 g/dl, blood urea 34 mmol/l; serum cal-cium 2 * 34 mmolIl. Twenty-four hour urinary protein was 0 - 44 g from 1460 ml of urine.
