5000|$|Unlike some {{existing}} benefits, such as Income Support, {{that have}} a 100% withdrawal rate, Universal Credit is gradually tapered away, like tax credits and Housing Benefit - so that, in theory, people can take a part-time job and still be allowed to keep {{some of the money}} they receive. Opinion on the effects of the benefit is divided. In theory, Universal Credit claimants should be better off taking on work, as the benefit will ensure they keep at least a proportion of the money they earn (as discussed here http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/11414408/With-Universal-Credit-work-might-finally-pay.html). However, reductions in funding and changes to the withdrawal rate meant that commentators {{on both sides of the}} political divide have questioned whether it will <b>make</b> <b>work</b> <b>pay.</b> The Daily Telegraph claimed [...] "part-time work may no longer pay", and [...] "some people would be better off refusing" [...] part-time work and in the Guardian, Polly Toynbee wrote [...] "Universal credit is simple: work more and get paid less". Universal Credit may also ensure that self-employment is no longer a worthwhile option for vast swathes of the population due to the [...] "Minimum Income Floor" [...] provision.|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} the Labour Government's success in {{improving}} the financial reward to work for low-income families. Since 1997, the Labour Government has instigate a series of reforms aimed at helping to <b>make</b> <b>work</b> <b>pay</b> more than not working, and to <b>make</b> <b>work</b> <b>pay</b> enough to help families avoid poverty. This report {{is the first to}} provide an overview of all such policies since 1997, and to provide an impartial analysis of the evidence of the Government's success to date. The report examines the key outcomes targeted by 'make work pay' policies, showing trends in the proportion of parents in employment, and the number of children in households where no adult is in paid work. It reviews studies which estimate the contribution that government policies made to these changes. And it provides new evidence on the impact of changes to personal taxes, tax credits and benefits on measures of financial work incentives. The authors also anticipate where this policy agenda might take the Government in the future. ...|$|E
30|$|Two main levers can <b>make</b> (formal) <b>work</b> <b>pay</b> for low-productivity {{workers and}} their employers: {{decreasing}} the labor tax wedge at lower wage levels and “smoothing” incentives with changes to social assistance, housing, and family benefits. Regarding the tax wedge, current social protection financing in several countries discriminates against lower earners. Options for reducing the labor tax wedge include incentives linked to wage subsidies, social insurance contribution credits, or so-called “in-work” or employment-conditional benefits—cash benefits or refundable income tax credits conditional on formal employment—for low-wage earners. With regard {{to the design of}} social assistance, housing, and family benefits, the key is to keep the marginal effective tax rate in mind when designing eligibility conditions and how benefits are withdrawn. The goal is to reform these benefits toward so-called “smart safety nets,” making social protection benefits more compatible with work. In particular, any additional wage should also increase beneficiaries’ net incomes, including benefits. Otherwise, additional <b>work</b> does not <b>pay,</b> and beneficiaries will prefer to not work at all, to work informally, or to underreport their earnings 3.|$|R
40|$|Areas of {{innovation}} where patents {{could not be}} or were not in use present a challenge to historians. On the one hand, the existence of patent-free innovation seems to show that, contrary to traditional views, obtaining patents {{is not the only}} motivation for those who innovate. On the other hand, such places and periods reveal an abundance of alternative strategies by which innovators sought to protect their ability to profit from their work. Drawing on three case studies from the history of British plant breeding in the long nineteenth-century, this paper substantiates the new revisionism about patents and innovation in a general way {{while at the same time}} throwing new light on how a specific community of innovators attempted to <b>make</b> their innovative <b>work</b> <b>pay.</b> Two conclusions emerge in what follows. One is that, during the period in question, science played an important part in British plant breeders' efforts to add value to their varieties. The other is that science was able to play this role only thanks to a pre-existing moral economy among the breeders. Arts, Education & Law Group, School of LawNo Full Tex...|$|R

30|$|Calls to {{strengthen}} automatic stabilizers {{also point to}} a paradox. There has been widespread focus on the (dis)incentive effects of taxes, unemployment benefits {{and other forms of}} social transfers. The quest has been to reduce the marginal effective tax rate on work (intensive margin) and <b>make</b> <b>work</b> <b>pay</b> (extensive margin). However, reforms aiming at strengthening the incentive structure may as an unintentional by-product weaken automatic stabilizers.|$|E
30|$|Our {{reading of}} the European {{evidence}} is that when programs are designed to award cash transfers in lieu of work, employment falls. In contrast, when programs are designed to encourage work and award transfers only when work clearly is not possible, employment rises.

40|$|The {{governments of}} the European Union are facing {{important}} challenges that may impact both their need and their capacity to collect taxes.

Finally, the desire to shift tax away from labour and to <b>make</b> <b>work</b> <b>pay</b> while retaining the social models will force Member States to find alternative robust tax bases.

With the exception of Germany there seems to be a consistent policy of making work pay through the introduction of a substantial in-work tax credit and a decrease of the basic rate.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{efforts to}} <b>make</b> <b>work</b> <b>pay,</b> concentrating on U. S. American and German policies and experiments. We are specifically interested in fleshing out {{the relevance of}} U. S. American models for a German context {{as well as the}} special characteristics of the German situation which do not allow a mere „copying“ of the models. There is no established negative income tax in Germany, but current experiments are being conducted, in order to assess how successful incentives could be in lowering the high levels of welfare caseloads and easing the transition from welfare to work. High unemployment rates and guaranteed social assistance (and unemployment insurance) have caused a German version of the poverty trap, where few incentives exist for people to find work. This paper examines the normative, political and economic situation of each country with specific experiments and studies of tax credits. The U. S. American early negative income tax (NIT) experiments in the 1970 s, the present day Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), and two recent experiments to <b>make</b> <b>work</b> <b>pay</b> are discussed. The historical, political and economic context of Germany is evaluated for a possible earned income tax credit, and fledgling tax credit experiments that are currently being conducted in Germany are discussed. A negative income tax is defined in this paper as a cash payment to individuals and families from respective governments that acts to subsidize personal income up to a predetermined level. There is a minimum benefit level, a marginal tax rate and a break-even point. The higher the benefit level and the break-even point, the more a negative income tax will cost the government (Zimmerman 1995). Before describing specific tax programs, we first outline the country's welfare state developments with respect to financial incentives for work. The following is a closer consideration of the U. S. -American and German public assistance and tax systems. The U. S. and Germany have very different welfare regimes and negative income taxes should inevitably fit into the respective welfare structures in different ways, fulfilling different goals. ...|$|E

Indicators of financial work incentives are needed for identifying any undesired influences of taxes and social transfers on people’s work decisions. Marginal effective tax rates (METRs) are calculated {{in order to show}} what part of a change in earnings is “taxed away” by the combined operation of taxes, social security contributions (SSCs), and any withdrawal of earnings related social benefits. Three different types of METRs are calculated in order to measure so-called low-wage,unemployment and inactivity traps, that is situations where incentives to work are low. The results allow the identification of countries and family types that face little financial incentive to increase work effort or to take up a job.
