5000|$|A {{few years}} after the {{introduction}} of the 8086 and 8088, Intel added some complexity to its naming scheme and terminology as the [...] "iAPX" [...] of the ambitious but ill-fated Intel iAPX 432 processor was tried on the more successful 8086 family of chips, applied as a kind of system-level prefix. An 8086 system, including coprocessors such as 8087 and 8089, as well as simpler Intel-specific system chips, was thereby described as an iAPX 86 system. There were also terms iRMX (for operating systems), iSBC (for single-board computers), and iSBX (for <b>multimodule</b> boards based on the 8086-architecture) all together under the heading Microsystem 80.

40|$|The hydroelastic {{behavior}} of very large floating structures (VLFSs) is investigated {{based on the}} proposed <b>multimodules</b> beam theory (MBT). To carry out the analysis, the VLFS is first divided into multiple submodules that are connected through their gravity center by a spatial beam with specific stiffness. The external force exerted on the submodules includes the wave hydrodynamic force {{as well as the}} beam bending force due to the relative displacements of different submodules. The wave hydrodynamic force is computed based on three-dimensional potential theory. The beam bending force is expressed {{in the form of a}} stiffness matrix. The motion response defined at the gravity center of the submodules is solved by the multibody hydrodynamic control equations; then both the displacement and the structure bending moment of the VLFS are determined from the stiffness matrix equations. To account for the moving point mass effects, the proposed method is extended to the time domain based on impulse response function (IRF) theory. The method is verified by comparison with existing results.

40|$|Several {{multilevel}} converter topologies have stimulated widespread interests amongst researchers {{because they}} have the capabilities of (i) reaching high voltage ratings without magnetics and transformers and (ii) attaining low Total Harmonic Distortions (THD), using the low switching frequencies of gate-turn-off thyristors (GTOS). This thesis focuses on the diode-clamped multilevel converter topology as the basic module for realizing the high kV voltage rating and the high MVA rating in controllers for the Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS). The thesis has extended the topology configurations to include: (i) multiple modules of multilevel converters and (ii) <b>multimodules</b> of multilevel converters in a back-to-back rectifier/inverter link. These configurations form the backbones for the following multilevel FACTS controllers: (a) the Shunt STAT(ic) COM(pensator), (b) the Series STATCOM, (c) the Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) and (d) the Asynchronous Link. A number of key technical innovations have been assembled together to make the new multilevel FACTS controllers possible. On the sides of the ac lines, the Fundamental Frequency Switching strategy has been extended so that it succeeds in simultaneously (a) lowering the Total Harmonic Distortions in the voltage and current waveforms, (b) controlling directly the ac voltage magnitudes, and (c) sharing the current loading in the parallel modules. On the side of the dc links of the STATCOMs, feedback controls have succeeded in: (a) regulating the total dc link voltages and (b) equalizing the dc capacitor voltages in all the levels. The voltage equalization by feedbacks cannot be accomplished {{in the case of the}} Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) and the Asynchronous Link. A system of locally controlled class-B choppers which transfer the charges from dc capacitors with the higher voltages to their contiguous neighbours with the lower voltages succeeds in equalizing the dc capacitor voltages. The proofs of performance of the multilevel FACTS controllers are substantiated by digital simulations. The equalization of the multilevel rectifier/inverter using the system of class-B choppers has been proven experimentally...|$|R

40|$|Background/PurposeThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of educational intervention using a <b>multimodule</b> curriculum of palliative care on medical students, and to explore significant factors that influence improvement in beliefs of ethical decision-making. MethodsA total of 259 medical students enrolled in the “Family, Society and Medicine” course, and accepted a <b>multimodule</b> palliative care curriculum that included a 1 -hour lecture, 1 hour of patient contact, 1 hour of literature reading, and 1 hour of discussion. A questionnaire was administered before and after the course to evaluate improvements in medical students' knowledge (principles and clinical management) of palliative care and their beliefs concerning ethical decision-making in palliative care. ResultsThe students showed significant improvements after the course in their knowledge of the principles of palliative care (pretest 58. 4 % vs. posttest 73. 1 %; p < 0. 01) and clinical management of palliative care (pretest 58. 8 % vs. posttest 67. 9 %; p < 0. 01). Although their beliefs about ethical decision-making were also improved after the course, the medical students did not have a positive belief of “artificial nutrition and hydration is not always beneficial for terminal cancer patients”, with a mean score of only 3. 15 and 3. 51 (pretest and posttest, respectively; range, 1 - 5). The logistic regression model showed that improvement in knowledge of either principles or clinical management did not significantly improve beliefs about ethical decision-making.

40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of this work is to {{effectively}} implement the ε-constraint method for producing Pareto optimal solutions for optimizing three objective functions, simultaneously, incorporating a Rotary Hybrid Flow Controller (RHFC) as an energy flow controller. The RHFC is a hybrid compensator composed of a Rotary Phase Shifting Transformer (RPST), a <b>multimodule</b> Thyristor-Switched Series Capacitor (TSSC), a <b>multimodule</b> Thyristor-Switched Series Reactor (TSSR) and a Mechanically-switched Shunt Capacitor (MSC). In this paper, a multi-objective Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is applied to optimally locate RHFC to improve the power system operation. Fuzzy decision-making is utilized in terms of optimal location processing, according to the best compromise among the Pareto optimal solutions. The optimal location and OPF model are implemented in General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) software in order to optimize total fuel cost, power loss and system loadability, as objective functions, simultaneously. Simulations are performed on IEEE 30 -bus and 118 -bus test systems to determine optimal parameters {{and the location of}} RHFC.

40|$|Batteries in a fuel-cell {{power system}} are {{essential}} to providing the additional power during the sharp load-transients. This necessitates a power-electronics subsystem (PES), which controls the energy flow between the fuel-cell stack, the battery, and the application load during the transient and in the steady states. In this paper, a distributed PES (comprising a <b>multimodule</b> dc-dc boost converter) is proposed for a fuel-cell and battery based hybrid power system, which provides higher cost effectiveness, efficiency, and footprint savings. This is realized by interfacing both the fuel-cell stack and the battery to the distributed PES using transfer switches, which are so controlled such that during a load transient, power from both the battery power and the fuel-cell stack is fed to the load via the PES while the stack energy input is adjusted for the new load demand. During the steady-state, the control implements a dynamic-power-management strategy such that only an optimal number of power converter modules of the distributed PES are activated yielding improved optimal energy-conversion efficiency and performance. Furthermore, using a composite Lyapunov-method-based methodology, the effect of dynamic change {{in the number of}} active power converter modules with varying load conditions on the stability of the PES is also outlined. Finally, the PES concept is experimentally validated by interfacing a <b>multimodule</b> bidirectional dc-dc boost converter with Nexa ® proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel-cell stacks from Ballard Power Systems. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 3119059...|$|E
