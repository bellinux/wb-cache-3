60|$|The {{result of}} my {{inquiries}} was briefly as follows:--Neufchâtel, whose prince is the King of Prussia, has receded from the confederation, {{on account of the}} recent changes, and the leaders of the aristocratic party were accused of combining a plan, under the protection and with the knowledge of the authorities of this state, to produce a counter-revolution in Berne, well knowing the influence of this canton in the confederation. This very day {{is said to be the}} one selected for the effort, and rumour adds, that a large body of the peasants of the Oberland were to have crossed the Brunig yesterday, with a view to co-operate in other sections of the country. A merry company we should have been, had it been our luck to have fallen in with this escort! Now, rightfully or not, the Austrian government and the French Carlists are openly accused of being concerned in this conspiracy, and probably not without some cause. The suspicions excited concerning our fellow-traveller, through his own acts, recurred to me, and I now think it probable he was in waiting for the aforesaid peasants, most probably to give them a <b>military</b> <b>direction,</b> for he had the air and franchise of an old French soldier.

40|$|Throughout the {{operations}} of the War of the Spanish Succession in the Low Countries and Germany, senior commanders such as John Churchill, duke of Marlborough, were aided, abetted and, on occasion, disrupted by a number of general and staff officers. These officers provided the mechanism by which supra-regimental command, <b>military</b> <b>direction</b> and management was effected. While these individuals possessed military dignity according to their rank and station, their real authority in the army was in no small part drawn from the powers and duties delegated to them by the commander-inchief, or assumed upon their own initiative; clear chains of command did not exist. Such officers functioned not only as vital elements in their own army, but within the broader context of the confederate warfare as a whole, in an army composed of English (later British), Dutch, Imperial, Danish and auxiliary German contingents. They came from diverse backgrounds and could possess constrasting political affiliations, aspirations and notions of duty. Their careers were governed as much by patronage and preference as any personal merit. A burgeoning sense of military duty was complicated by personal prejudice and the boundary between public and private endeavour was indistinct. Some officers gained wealth and financial security; others were ruined by the peculations of others. ...|$|E
40|$|Some seventy-one {{years ago}} it was {{identified}} that there was a role for drones to play within our society. Whilst the military were quick to realize this and develop the technology, it is only recently that the civilian application is being explored on mass. That said, given this prediction and the <b>military</b> <b>direction,</b> legislators find themselves now unprepared for the civilian use and market potential. However, this is not an unprecedented situation – the civil aviation (manned) market has often shown the inability to work together, to be prepared and to cooperate. As a consequence, there has been fragmentation and arguably casualties associated with such lethargy. This paper discusses the aspect of risk, governance and liability (predominately covering safety and security) and the need for a suitable framework to be put in place relating to drone usage (particularly viewed from the perspective of third parties). The paper identifies the challenges, whilst the research focus concerns the direction of the European Union and the lessons learnt from the unity and development of such within the manned civil aviation framework. It is argued, that going forward, there is a need not just to adapt existing aviation systems and mechanism and to apply best practices, but to learn from past failures and the success of other modes and system...|$|E
40|$|Reconfigurable antennas {{have been}} a subject of rapidly {{increased}} interest during the past decades. This has been prompted by the increased demand on new wireless communications technology in both civilian and <b>military</b> <b>directions.</b> Moreover, different types of reconfigurations have been identified and investigated {{to keep up with}} the demand for new technologies. In this research, the possibility of designing reconfigurable Dielectric Resonator Antennas (DRAs) have been explored with different types of reconfigurability directions, especially with the increased interest in the area of DRAs during the past three decades. These results have been satisfactory in general. The main aim of this research is to experiment with different reconfigurability designs, each purpose is to achieve one type of reconfigurability or more. This includes, polarisation reconfigurability in Chapter Three, frequency agility in Chapters Four and Five, beam steering and gain agility in Chapter Five. Furthermore, this research main aim has been to investigate new ways to exploit the advantages of the semiconductor plasma in reconfigurable antennas. However, research’s limited resources led to reduce the efforts in this area to only one experiment, which is presented in Chapter Six, based on a similar design presented in Chapter Four. Although the results have been conflicted for the last experiment, the results shown that the used reconfigurability medium (AlGaN/GaN HFETs) can be benefitted better from it in other application. Two models have been introduced for polarisation reconfigurability, a hemispherical DRA couple with reconfigurable annular slot excitation, and a notched rectangular DRA with reconfigurable parasitic strip(s). Both designs shown the possibility of achieving LP/CP radiations. In addition, rectangular DRAs that are excited with single, as well as multiple, slot have been studied. Prototypes have been built and measured with reasonable agreement between practical and simulated results. Furthermore, the work has been extended to study a reconfigurable DRA linear array where several designs have been investigated including single and dual-slot for two and four-element linear arrays. The single-slot model reconfiguration resulted in the expected beam steering alongside the array direction. On the other hand, both frequency tuning and beam steering {{have been a}}chieved with the dual-slots models. Finally, the semiconductor plasma reconfigurable antennas have been considered with the investigation of AlGaN/GaN HFETs as a replacement for the well investigated and presented silicon SPIN diodes. The prototype has been measure and discrepancies between measurements and simulations have been discussed. ...|$|R
