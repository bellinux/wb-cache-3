The adaptive method is referred to as ‘h’ method if mesh refinement is used, ‘r’ method if the number of grid point is fixed and not redistributed and ‘p’ if the order of solution scheme is increased in finite-element theory. The multi diemensional problems using the equi-distribution scheme can be accomplished in several ways. The simplest to understand are the Poisson Grid Generators with control function based on the equidistribution of the weight function with the diffusion set as a multiple of desired cell volume. The equidistribution scheme can also be applied to the unstructured problem. The problem is the connectivity hampers if <b>mesh</b> <b>point</b> movement is very large. Steady flow and the time-accurate flow calculation can be solved through this adaptive method. The grid is refined and after a predetermined number of iteration in order to adapt it in a steady flow problem. The grid will stop adjusting to the changes once the solution converges. In time accurate case coupling of the Partial Differential Equations of the physical problem and those describing the grid movement is required.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Wireless mesh {{networking}} (WMN) {{is regarded as}} a low-cost technology for rapid wireless network deployment. However, in a single-channel WMN, the overlapped transmission ranges between relaying mesh points could introduce serious interference. Using multiple radios over multiple channels can decrease the interference and improve the capacity of a WMN, but it increases the cost of a <b>mesh</b> <b>point.</b> One possible solution to balance between interference, hence performance, and cost is utilizing fewer radios that switch among multiple channels instead of using per-channel radios. In this paper, we propose a channel-switching method, called the traffic-aware switching scheme (TRASS), for a <b>mesh</b> <b>point</b> with a limited number of radios. TRASS utilizes the existing IEEE 802. 11 mechanisms, i. e., hybrid-coordinationfunction-controlled channel access and power saving, to avoid packet loss during channel switching. A TRASS <b>mesh</b> <b>point</b> monitors the occupied channel time to schedule radios that switch among channels. The implemented TRASS demonstrates 75 % throughput improvement by (2, 1), i. e., two-channel single-radio, over (1, 1). (3, 2) and (3, 1) achieve 69. 8 % and 39. 7 %, respectively, of the throughput of (3, 3) in the simulated TRASS.
