50|$|The <b>meadow</b> <b>fritillary</b> is {{frequently}} encountered in wet, open places, including pastures, fields, and streamsides.|$|E
50|$|The purplish {{fritillary}} {{is also a}} bit {{smaller than}} the <b>meadow</b> <b>fritillary,</b> and {{the underside of the}} hindwings are a deep, rusty red.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{species in}} the <b>meadow</b> <b>{{fritillary}}'s</b> range include the silver-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene), the bog fritillary (Boloria eunomia), and the purplish fritillary (Boloria chariclea).|$|R
2500|$|The Glanville {{fritillary}} {{is found}} across Europe and temperate Asia. It is most commonly {{found on the}} Åland Islands of Finland, which host a network of about 4,000 dry <b>meadows,</b> the <b>fritillary's</b> ideal habitat. These butterflies commonly inhabit open grassland at an elevation of [...] above sea level.|$|R

50|$|Melitaea parthenoides, the <b>meadow</b> <b>fritillary,</b> is a {{butterfly}} of the Nymphalidae family. Note {{that the common}} name <b>meadow</b> <b>fritillary</b> is also used for the North American species Boloria bellona. It is found in south-western Europe, more specifically on the Iberian Peninsula, south-western France, parts of the Italian Alps and southern and south-western Germany and a few regions of Switzerland. Recently one was spotted by an officer for The Parks Trust on private farmland in Tingewick, Buckingham, England, which was later confirmed by Butterfly Conservation, {{as reported in the}} local newspaper dated 15 August 2014.|$|E
50|$|The bog {{fritillary}} {{is a bit}} smaller than the <b>meadow</b> <b>fritillary,</b> its wing bases are hairy, and {{on the underside of}} the hindwing are a series of bands and patches which are rust red, yellow, and white.|$|E
50|$|The meadow is {{dominated}} by species such as meadowsweet and common couch. A number of different species of sedge have been record and these include the nationally rare downey-fruited sedge (Carex tomentosa). Orchids present include southern marsh orchid. Adder's tongue flourishes on this site. The <b>meadow</b> supports <b>fritillary</b> which is nationally rare.|$|R
50|$|Fox <b>Fritillary</b> <b>Meadow</b> is a 2.4 hectare {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest {{north of}} Framsden in Suffolk. It is owned and {{managed by the}} Suffolk Wildlife Trust.|$|R
50|$|Fox <b>Fritillary</b> <b>Meadow</b> {{nature reserve}} and Site of Special Scientific Interest is located {{to the north}} of the village. The reserve is managed by Suffolk Wildlife Trust and is a major site within East Anglia for snake's-head {{fritillary}} (Fritillaria meleagris).|$|R
50|$|The female is {{the active}} flight partner. Females deposit greenish-yellow eggs near the host plant on twigs or leaves. Mature larvae are gray and black with small, light colored spines. The {{chrysalis}} is yellow brown. The <b>meadow</b> <b>fritillary</b> overwinters as a larva. It has {{one or two}} broods per year.|$|E
5000|$|The upperside of {{the wings}} is yellow orange with dark spots, lines, and zigzagged bands. The forewing is squared off {{just below the}} apex. A dark border on the hindwing margin is lacking on most individuals. It has long palps. The {{underside}} of the wings are mottled with orange and purplish-brown. There is a yellowish band that runs across {{the center of the}} hindwing. It lacks the silver spots most lesser fritillaries have. The forewing is smudged with orange and brown near the apex. The wingspan of the <b>meadow</b> <b>fritillary</b> is 3.5 - 5.1 cm ( [...] - 2 inches).|$|E
5|$|The birds seen on Brean Down include {{peregrine}} falcon, jackdaw, kestrel, collared {{and stock}} doves, common whitethroat, common linnet, stonechat, dunnock, rock pipit and– in 2007 – Britain's {{first and only}} Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross.

5000|$|Another reserve {{run by the}} Trust, Glasbury Cutting, {{is located}} at Glasbury-on-Wye, {{in the far east}} of the Trust's {{administrative}} area. Formerly part of the railway line between Brecon and Hereford, which closed in 1962, it is composed partly of woodland and partly of a meadow created to encourage wild plants. Dormice, a protected species, were discovered within the reserve in 2000. In the far south-west, Cae Lynden Nature Reserve is one of three reserves close together near Ystradgynlais. The grasslands of this former sports field encourage marsh <b>fritillary,</b> <b>meadow</b> brown and gatekeeper butterflies.|$|R
5000|$|The {{plant was}} once {{abundant}} in the UK, particularly in the Thames Valley and parts of Wiltshire, and was collected in vast quantities to be sold as a cut flower in the markets of London, Oxford and Birmingham. During World War II most of the ancient meadows were ploughed up and {{turned over to the}} production of food crops, destroying much of the plant's habitat. Although a popular garden plant it is now rare in the wild, although there are some notable sites where it is still found, such as the meadows at Magdalen College, Iffley Meadows, Oxford and the Oxfordshire village of Ducklington, which holds a [...] "Fritillary Sunday" [...] festival It is also found in the North Meadow National Nature Reserve, Wiltshire, Clattinger Farm Nature Reserve, Wiltshire and Fox <b>Fritillary</b> <b>Meadow</b> and Mickfield Meadow nature reserves in Suffolk. In 2002 it was chosen as the County flower of Oxfordshire following a poll by the wild flora conservation charity Plantlife.|$|R
