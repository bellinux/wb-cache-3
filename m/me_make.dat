500|$|Sanford {{was born}} in 1917 in Laurinburg, North Carolina, the son of Elizabeth Terry (Martin) and Cecil Leroy Sanford, both of English descent. He became an Eagle Scout in Laurinburg's Troop 20 of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). Shortly before he died, Sanford related his Scouting {{experience}} to journalist David Gergen and said that it [...] "probably saved {{my life in the}} war. Boys who had been Scouts or had been in the CCC knew how to look after themselves in the woods.... What I learned in Scouts sustained me all my life; it helped <b>me</b> <b>make</b> decisions about what was best." [...] The BSA recognized him with its Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.|$|E
500|$|Unlike his provocative written language, Wills {{spoke in}} a breezy and laconic manner. In one of his {{borderline}} [...] "thought disordered" [...] letters, {{it is evident that}} at times he entered a state of depersonalisation: [...] "I do not know what I am standing on ... when anyone speaks to me I cannot for the life of <b>me</b> <b>make</b> out what they are talking about—everything seems so curious." [...] In 1884, Hammersley compared Wills' incipient madness and fiery glare to that of Adam Lindsay Gordon, the Australian bush poet. Wills' mental instability is a source for speculation: epilepsy has been suggested as a possible cause of his perplexed mental state, and a variant of bipolar illness may account for his disjointed thinking and flowery, confused writings.|$|E

500|$|In 1955, {{aided by}} junior counsel Sebag Shaw and Peter Rawlinson, Stevenson defended Ruth Ellis against {{the charge of}} murdering her lover. Stevenson's {{decision}} to keep his cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses to a minimum, and his [...] "near silent performance in court", have been severely criticised by Muriel Jakubait, Ellis's sister. He opened the defence by saying: [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>make</b> this abundantly plain: {{there is no question}} here but this woman shot this man... You will not hear one word from me– or from the lady herself– questioning that." [...] The jury took 23minutes to find Ellis guilty; she was sentenced to be hanged, the last woman executed for murder in the United Kingdom. Public revulsion at the case is thought to have played a part in the abolition of capital punishment in the UK in 1969.|$|E
500|$|... "Revolver" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna, Carlos Battey, Steven Battey, Lil Wayne, Justin Franks and Brandon Kitchen, and {{produced}} by Madonna and DJ Frank E. In an interview with Hiphopupdate.com, Frank E recalled that {{he had gone to}} the recording session two hours before his scheduled meeting with Madonna to set up and give the audio files to the recording engineer, and he said that the ensuing wait was incredibly nerve-racking for him. After Madonna arrived, they recorded her vocals and the song was finished the next day. [...] Reminiscing about the session, he said: [...] "I will never forget the feeling of leaving that session after vocal producing Madonna, and thinking to myself, 'It can’t it really get any harder than this.' I've taken that mentality into every other session I've been in, and it's helped <b>me</b> <b>make</b> the session and song more of a success. Unfortunately, the mix sounded like crap and the song flopped, but hey, you win some and you lose some." ...|$|E
500|$|As in most Westminster system parliaments, Australia's {{government}} is {{formed by the}} party enjoying {{the confidence of the}} lower House of Parliament, the House of Representatives. However, Australia's Parliament also has a powerful upper house, the Senate, which must pass any legislation initiated by the House of Representatives if it is to become law. The composition of the Senate, in which each state has an equal number of senators regardless of that state's population, was originally designed to attract the Australian colonies into one Federation. The Constitution forbids the Senate to originate or amend a money bill, but places no limitation on the Senate's ability to defeat one. In 1970, Gough Whitlam, as Leader of the Opposition, had stated of a budget bill, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>make</b> it clear at the outset that our opposition to this Budget is no mere formality. We intend to press our opposition by all available means on all related measures in both Houses. If the motion is defeated, we will vote against the Bills here and in the Senate. Our purpose is to destroy this Budget and destroy the Government which has sponsored it." ...|$|E

500|$|In the {{television}} series Alias (2001–06), Cooper achieved some {{success for the}} role of Will Tippin, a local reporter for a newspaper and the best friend of Jennifer Garner's character, Sydney Bristow. Garner {{was one of the first}} people he met in Los Angeles and was, in Cooper's words, [...] "very maternal... She wanted to take care of <b>me,</b> <b>make</b> sure I was okay all the time." [...] He acted in the 2002 psychological thriller Changing Lanes. The scenes in which he appeared were edited out of the final cut of the film, but are featured on the film's DVD and Blu-ray releases. Also in 2002, he played a man involved in a love triangle in the romantic drama Bending All the Rules. He guest-starred in the short-lived TV series Miss Match and played the part of cowboy and race horse trainer Morgan Murphy in {{the television}} film The Last Cowboy, which aired on the Hallmark Channel in January 2003. He later appeared in the television film I Want to Marry Ryan Banks (2004) with Jason Priestley and as a regular guest star in the WB series Jack & Bobby (2004–05).|$|E
500|$|Grey's Anatomy {{has been}} well {{received}} among critics. The show holds an average of 71% positive score on Rotten Tomatoes and 7.7/10 score at IMDB site. The A.V. Club gave an insight on both the overwhelming success and lows {{in the quality of}} the hit medical drama saying, [...] "The quality arc for the show is all over the place, starting with a steady build in the first season, then skyrocketing into phenomenon in season two, then leveling off and dipping in season three, before having some seriously bumpy moments in seasons four (interrupted by the writers’ strike) and five. The climb begins again in season six" [...] Samantha Highfill of Entertainment Weekly in a review wrote, [...] " [...] I believe the show’s best season to date is season 2. Let <b>me</b> <b>make</b> it clear that I’m not saying seasons 3 through 9 were bad. In my opinion, there have only been a few lulls in the show’s history, and most of them didn’t last a full season." [...] adding, [...] "I still enjoy the show, and I’ll honestly never stop watching. By any standards, Grey’s Anatomy has been successful television, ranking highly in the ratings for nine seasons and entering the cultural lexicon via phrases as cloying yet catchy as [...] "McDreamy.", the show has had its periods of being intensely irritating, and it has had its periods when it seems as if Shonda Rhimes has taken leave of her faculties, but it’s also got an amazingly high batting average, particularly with every solid season that passes along in this second act of its run." [...] The site lauded the show saying, [...] "On average, it’s been very good TV, filled with interesting, driven characters who run the gamut of professions within the show’s hospital setting. It’s been, by turns, a good soap, a good romantic comedy, a good medical drama, and a good interpersonal show about an unexpected workplace family." ...|$|E
500|$|Mac Sledge finds {{redemption}} {{largely through}} his relationship and eventual marriage with Rosa Lee. This {{is in keeping}} with the motif of fidelity common in the works of Foote, inspired, said the writer, by his marriage to Lillian Vallish Foote. He told The New York Times that she [...] "kept me goin'. She never lost faith, and that's a rare thing. I don't know now how we got through it, but we got through it." [...] The lyrics of [...] "If You'll Hold the Ladder", which Mac performs with his new country band {{in the second half of}} the film, suggest what love has done for him. He sings of someone holding the ladder for him as he climbs to the top; this is symbolic of Rosa's love and guidance, which has allowed Sledge to improve himself and build a new life. The desultory romances that defined his past are represented by the more promiscuous lyrics of Dixie Scott's songs, such as those of [...] "The Best Bedroom in Town": [...] "The best part of all / the room at the end of the hall / That's where you and <b>me</b> <b>make</b> everything alright ... We celebrate the happiness we've found / Every night in the best bedroom in town". His storming out of her concert symbolizes his rejection of that earlier life. In contrast, Rosa Lee sings the humble church hymn, [...] "Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me". In a related way, the film emphasizes the importance of the woman's role in domestic life—although Mac takes on the role of patriarch in his new family setting, it is only through the support and care of Rosa Lee that he is able to settle into this role. Sociologist Norman K. Denzin points out that Tender Mercies embodies many of the ideas of recovery from addiction that are part of the twelve-step program used by Alcoholics Anonymous. Both the film and the support group's program advocate the idea of hitting rock-bottom, making a decision to stop drinking, dealing with the past and adopting a spiritual way of life.|$|E

(She had relented in late 1970 and recorded [...] "Help <b>Me</b> <b>Make</b> It Through the Night" [...] on the album Careless Hands, which was released in 1971.) As the sexual revolution peaked, so did West's career. Under United Artists, West's material changed from traditional country to up-tempo and slow-tempo Adult Contemporary-styled music. In 1977, West released her first album under United Artists, When It's Just You and Me. The title track peaked at No.19 on the country charts.|$|E
