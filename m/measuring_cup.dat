5|$|Susan, a {{divorced}} mother, takes interest in Mike Delfino (James Denton), a plumber who has {{recently moved to}} Wisteria Lane; however, she faces competition with neighbor Edie Britt (Nicollette Sheridan), a promiscuous serial divorcée. Suspicious that Mike is spending the night with Edie, Susan enters Edie's home uninvited with the pretense of borrowing sugar. While inside, she accidentally knocks over a candle, which sets fire to the entire house. Susan flees the scene, leaving behind her glass <b>measuring</b> <b>cup.</b> Though wracked with guilt, Susan is relieved to learn that Mike was not the man with whom Edie was fornicating. Meanwhile, Lynette, a former career woman, is frustrated with raising four young children while her husband, Tom (Doug Savant), is constantly away on business.|$|E
25|$|Acclimation is {{a process}} that is {{performed}} when adding new marine life to an aquarium, particularly for invertebrates, who lack osmoregulation. This process slowly introduces the organisms to the water composition of the new environment, preventing shock resulting from sudden changes in water chemistry. There are several different methods of doing this, including the use of a drip line, or of a <b>measuring</b> <b>cup</b> or other device to slowly mix water from the aquarium tank into a container with the new animal.|$|E

Transparent plastic <b>measuring</b> <b>cups</b> allow {{ingredient}} levels to be easily visible, and are lighter and less fragile than glass <b>measuring</b> <b>cups.</b> Plastic handles added to utensils improve comfort and grip. While many plastics deform or decompose if heated, a few silicone products can be used in boiling water or in an oven for food preparation. Non-stick plastic coatings can be applied to frying pans; newer coatings avoid the issues with decomposition of plastics under strong heating.|$|R

5000|$|Heat-resistant glass {{utensils}} can be {{used for}} baking or other cooking. Glass does not conduct heat as well as metal, and has the drawback of breaking easily if dropped. Transparent glass <b>measuring</b> <b>cups</b> allow ready measurement of liquid and dry ingredients.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Measuring</b> <b>cups</b> {{usually have}} {{capacities}} from 250 ml (approx. 1 cup (volume) to 1000 ml (approx. 4 cups = 2 pints = 1 quart), though larger sizes {{are also available}} for commercial use.

Dry <b>measure</b> <b>cups</b> without a scale are sometimes used, in sets typically of 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, and 1 cup. The units may be milliliters or fractions of a liter, or (specially in the United States [...] ) the cup (unit) with its fractions (typically 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, and 3/4), pints, and often fluid ounces. Sometimes multiples of teaspoons and tablespoons are included. There may also be scales for the approximate weight for particular substances, such as flour and sugar.|$|R
5|$|Certain {{problems}} can be solved using this result. For example, consider two <b>measuring</b> <b>cups</b> of volume a and b.

5000|$|The cup is an English unit of volume, most {{commonly}} associated with cooking and serving sizes.

The shear rate was first ramped up from 0 to 200  s− 1 in 3  min and then ramped down in 3  min. All measurements were taken at a shear rate of 100  s− 1 during ramping up period. The measured viscosity value was the apparent viscosity.|$|R
