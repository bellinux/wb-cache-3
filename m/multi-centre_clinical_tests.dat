40|$|BACKGROUND Multicentre {{clinical}} trials are challenged by high administrative burden, data management pitfalls and costs. This {{leads to a}} reduced enthusiasm and commitment of the physicians involved and thus to a reluctance in conducting multicentre {{clinical trials}}. OBJECTIVE The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a web-based open source platform to support a <b>multi-centre</b> <b>clinical</b> trial. METHODS We developed on Drupal, an open source software distributed under the terms of the General Public License, a web-based, <b>multi-centre</b> <b>clinical</b> trial management system with the design science research approach. RESULTS This system was evaluated by user-testing and well supported several completed and on-going clinical trials and is available for free download. CONCLUSION Open source clinical trial management systems are capable in supporting <b>multi-centre</b> <b>clinical</b> trials by enhancing efficiency, quality of data management and collaboration...|$|R

40|$|The Electronic Health Record is {{of utmost}} {{importance}} to enable the provision of high-quality collaborative care; one prominent development is openEHR. On the other hand, a systematic approach to {{support the use of}} routine data for <b>multi-centre</b> <b>clinical</b> research is becoming increasingly important. One example of this is the extensible architecture for using routine data for additional purposes (eardap) which features comprehensive terminological support. However, as experiences in various medical fields have shown, the terminology-based approach is limited to specialized fields and it is argued that a comprehensive terminology is simply too complex and too difficult to maintain. As the openEHR archetype approach does not rely heavily on big standardized terminologies, it offers more flexibility during standardisation of clinical concepts and overcome the shortcomings of terminology-focused approaches. It is unknown, however, how far the more generic openEHR approach can also enable re-use of routinely collected data for clinical research purposes – the use case for which eardap was designed. We therefore explored the feasibility of using the openEHR approach to support multi-centre research in comparison to eardap. Generally speaking, our results show that both eardap and openEHR are suitable to enable the use of routine data for <b>multi-centre</b> <b>clinical</b> research. As the openEHR approach also ensures open, future-proof Electronic Health Records, we conclude that it is highly desirable that <b>multi-centre</b> <b>clinical</b> trials adopt openEHR...|$|R
40|$|A mixture model {{incorporating}} long-term survivors {{has been}} adopted {{in the field of}} biostatistics where some individuals may never experience the failure event under study. The surviving fractions may be considered as cured. In most applications, the survival times are assumed to be independent. However, when the survival data are obtained from a <b>multi-centre</b> <b>clinical</b> trial, it is conceived that the environ mental conditions and facilities shared within clinic affects the proportion cured as well as the failure risk for the uncured individuals. It necessitates a long-term survivor mixture model with random effects. In this paper, the long-term survivor mixture model is extended for the analysis of multivariate failure time data using the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) approach. The proposed model is applied to analyse a numerical data set from a <b>multi-centre</b> <b>clinical</b> trial of carcinoma as an illustration. Some simulation experiments are performed to assess the applicability of the model based on the average biases of the estimates formed. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Background Malnutrition {{is common}} in {{patients}} with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), and is associated with impaired quality of life (QoL), longer hospital stay and higher risk of treatment-related adverse events. This phase III <b>multi-centre</b> randomised <b>clinical</b> trial <b>tested</b> early enteral feeding versus standard care on postoperative QoL. Methods From 2009 to 2013, 109 patients requiring surgery for suspected advanced EOC, moderately to severely malnourished were enrolled at five sites across Queensland and randomised to intervention (n = 53) or control (n = 56) groups. Intervention involved intraoperative nasojejunal tube placement and enteral feeding until adequate oral intake could be maintained. Despite being randomised to intervention, 20 patients did not receive feeds (13 did not receive the feeding tube; 7 had it removed early). Control involved postoperative diet as tolerated. QoL was measured at baseline, 6 weeks postoperatively and 30 days after the third cycle of chemotherapy. The primary outcome measure was the difference in QoL between the intervention and the control group. Secondary endpoints included treatment-related adverse event occurrence, length of stay, postoperative services use, and nutritional status. Results Baseline characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. No significant difference in QoL {{was found between the}} groups at any time point. There was a trend towards better nutritional status in patients who received the intervention but the differences did not reach statistical significance except for the intention-to-treat analysis at 7 days postoperatively (11. 8 intervention vs. 13. 8 control, p 0. 04).

40|$|Despite {{the use of}} {{standardized}} protocols in, <b>multi-centre,</b> randomized <b>clinical</b> trials, outcome may vary between centres. Such heterogeneity may alter the interpretation and reporting of the treatment effect. Below, we propose a general frailty modelling approach for investigating, inter alia, putative treatment-by-centre interactions in time-to-event data in <b>multi-centre</b> <b>clinical</b> trials. A correlated random effects model is used to model the baseline risk and the treatment effect across centres. It may be based on shared, individual or correlated random effects. For inference we develop the hierarchical-likelihood (or h-likelihood) approach which facilitates computation of prediction intervals for the random effects with proper precision. We illustrate our methods using disease-free time-to-event data on bladder cancer patients participating in an European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer trial, and a simulation study. We also demonstrate model selection using h-likelihood criteria...|$|R

To assess if a set of explicative variables impacts on the health-related {{quality of life}}, regression models are routinely adopted. However, the interest of researchers may be focussed on modelling other parts (e. g. quantiles) of this conditional distribution. In this paper we present an approach based on M-quantile regression to achieve this goal. We applied the proposed methodology to a prospective, randomized, <b>multi-centre</b> <b>clinical</b> trial.

The data are generated via a fixed, but unobservable, realisation of the vector. We derive the smallest confidence region for a specific component of this random vector under a joint Bayesian/frequentist paradigm. On average this optimal region can be much smaller than the corresponding Bayesian highest posterior density region. The new estimation procedure is especially appealing when one deals with data generated under a highly parallel structure.

40|$|<b>Clinical</b> <b>tests</b> of {{pharmaceuticals}} {{on people}} have for long stirred much controversy, also {{of legal and}} fi nancial nature, and, in particular, regarding the obligation put on the sponsor of the tests to co-fi nance the treatment {{with the use of}} tested drugs together with the National Health Fund. The existing regulations of the above procedure are not very extensive and the main legal act governing <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> today is the Act of 6 September 2001 called: Pharmaceutical Law. Pursuant to its Art. 37 k para. 1 in force as of 1 May 2011, the sponsor fi nances the work needed to be performed by health service units to conduct <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> that are covered by a <b>clinical</b> <b>test</b> protocol, and which {{are not part of the}} guaranteed health care services referred to in the Act on health care services fi nanced from public funds. In particular, as the Act provides, the sponsor is responsible for supply, free of charge, of the tested pharmaceuticals to all participants of <b>clinical</b> <b>tests,</b> as well as for the provision of other appliances needed to administer the tested drugs. Another important issue related to <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> is the obligatory insurance when it comes to <b>clinical</b> <b>tests.</b> This issue is been only recently regulated in Poland. The fi rst relevant ordinance came in force on 11 May 1999 and it regulates the specifi c principles of creating and fi nancing bioethics committees and the manner in which they should function. The ordinance introduced an obligation of insuring the patients participating in <b>clinical</b> <b>tests.</b> Another Act issued pursuant to Art. 37 b para. 3 of the Act: Pharmaceutical Law was the ordinance of the Minister of Finance of 30 April 2004 on the obligatory civil insurance of the researcher and the sponsor, which determined a detailed scope of their civil liability for damages caused or arising from <b>clinical</b> <b>tests,</b> leaving apart, however, the issues related to the liability insurance of the research centre. Hence, in spite of the existence of some regulation of the issues connected with conducting <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> in Poland, there is still a need for a more complex regulation to be contained in one Act on <b>clinical</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Nephrin is an {{integral}} part of podocytes that together with endothelial cells and the basement form the glomerular filtration barrier. Placental ischemia triggers a cascade of events that ultimately result in endothelial malfunction, hypertension, podocytopathy and fetal compromise. Methods: We review the literature to determine if urine nephrin measurements could serve as a useful biomarker to detect early podocyte injury in pre-eclampsia. Results: Our search identifies eight studies published to date. The findings of these studies demonstrate that urine nephrin excretion plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of proteinuria during pre-eclampsia and that this is a good indicator of glomerular injury. Conclusion: There is thus an urgent need for a large <b>multi-centre</b> <b>clinical</b> study using standardized recruitment criteria to determine the full potential of this biomarker in clinical practice...|$|R

ParticipantsPeople with shoulder pain who underwent <b>clinical</b> <b>testing</b> in order to diagnose rotator cuff pathology. Outcome measuresThe diagnostic accuracy of <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> was determined using likelihood ratios. ResultsThirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The 13 studies evaluated 14 <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> in 89 separate evaluations of diagnostic accuracy. Only one evaluation, palpation for supraspinatus ruptures, resulted in significant positive and negative likelihood ratios. Eight of the 89 evaluations resulted in either significant positive or negative likelihood ratios. However, none of these eight positive or negative likelihood ratios were found in other studies. Of the 89 evaluations of <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> 71 (80 %) {{did not result in}} either significant positive or negative likelihood ratio evaluations across different studies. ConclusionOverall, most tests for rotator cuff pathology were inaccurate and cannot be recommended for clinical use. At best, suspicion of a rotator cuff tear may be heightened by a positive palpation, combined Hawkins/painful arc/infraspinatus test, Napoleon test, lift-off test, belly-press test, or drop-arm test, and it may be reduced by a negative palpation, empty can test or Hawkins-Kennedy test...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to present a {{rationale}} to explore the use of <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> for the sacroiliac joints to detect early axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) and to suggest a protocol to validate these <b>clinical</b> <b>tests.</b> Based on the European Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatments of Pelvic Girdle Pain, we propose a set of six <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> to identify the likely presence of inflammation in the sacroiliac joints associated with early axial SpA. As magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the current gold standard used to identify inflammation in the sacroiliac joints, the results of the proposed set of <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> are compared with those from the MRI examinations. We hypothesize that specific <b>clinical</b> <b>tests,</b> which combine pain provocation and functional tests, for assessing the sacroiliac joints will help to identify early active inflammation at the sacroiliac joints in axial SpA.

Objectives: To {{evaluate the}} diagnostic accuracy of <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> used to diagnose patients with structural lumbar segmental instability (LSI). Backround: Patients with structural LSI represent an important, identifiable subgrouping {{of individuals with}} low back pain. Numerous <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> have been proposed to diagnose structural LSI; however, data on the diagnostic accuracy of these tests {{have not yet been}} evaluated through a systematic review of the literature. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in 6 electronic databases for diagnostic accuracy studies, published between January 1950 and March 2010, that evaluated <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> against radiological diagnosis of structural LSI. The diagnostic accuracy of the <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> from the retrieved articles was independently evaluated, reviewed, and quality scored using the QUADAS tool. Results: Four articles and a total of 11 <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> used in the diagnosis of structural LSI met the study inclusion criteria. The majority of tests had high specificity but low sensitivity, with positive likelihood ratios ranging from very small to moderate. QUADAS scores ranged from 16 to 25 out of a possible 26. The passive lumbar extension test was the most accurate <b>clinical</b> <b>test,</b> with high sensitivity (84 %), specificity (90 %), and a positive likelihood ratio of 8. 8 (95 % CI: 4. 5, 17. 3), indicating that this <b>clinical</b> <b>test</b> may be useful in the differential diagnosis of structural LSI. Conclusion: This systematic review found that the majority of <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> routinely employed to diagnose structural LSI demonstrated only limited ability to do so. The results do, however, indicate that the passive lumbar extension test may be useful in orthopaedic clinical practice to diagnose structural LSI. Additional research is required to further validate its use for diagnosing structural LSI in all populations of those with low back pain...|$|R

Methods : The National Benchmarks and Evidence-based National Clinical guidelines for Heart failure management programmes study used an investigator-developed questionnaire concerning a clinical audit for heart failure programmes throughout Australia. Ethical guidelines developed by the National governing body of health and medical research in Australia classified the National Benchmarks and Evidence-based National Clinical guidelines for Heart failure management programmes Study as a low risk clinical audit not requiring ethical approval by IREC. Results : Fifteen of 27 IRECs stipulated that the research proposal undergo full ethical review. None of the IRECs acknowledged: national quality assurance guidelines and recommendations nor ethics approval from other IRECs. Twelve of the 15 IRECs used different ethics application forms. Variability in the type of amendments was prolific. Lack of uniformity in ethical review processes resulted in a six- to eight-month delay in commencing the national study.
