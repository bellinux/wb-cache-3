40|$|Bluetooth is a {{personal}} wireless communication technology and is being applied in many scenarios. Current existing MAC (Medium Access Control) Scheduling Algorithm. It is very challenging to provide QOS (Quality of Service) support for different connections due to the feature of <b>Master</b> <b>Driven</b> TDD (Time Division Duplex). The proposed system addresses the issues of how to enhance the QoS in Bluetooth Network. The MAC scheduling Algorithm, which can provide different QoS for different connections based on priorities. The current Bluetooth implementations adopt Round Robin(RR) Algorithm which only provides Best-Effort Service to all applications, {{which leads to a}} low bandwidth utilization and increase in time delay, when one or more slaves have no data to transmit. To alleviate this problem, some scheduling algorithms have been proposed. The MAC scheduling algorithm can provide different QoS for different connections based on their priorities. Considering the feature of <b>master</b> <b>driven</b> TDD, it defines a token counters to estimate the traffic of real-time slaves, to increase the bandwidth utilization. A backoff mechanism is then presented for best-effort slaves to decrease the frequency of polling idle slaves. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves better performance than existing Round Robin Algorithm...|$|R

While I would agree that Robert California alters the tone and rhythm of the series when he is present, he isn’t present particularly often (and wasn’t present at all during what Seitz and I would both identify as the season’s strongest episode, [...] "Lotto") and, even when he is present, he isn’t really being developed as a character with motivations or multi-dimensionality. His omniscience is valuable on some level, but it also creates a distance between the character and the narrative, which makes me reluctant to consider him as Carell’s replacement (which is what Seitz suggests in his piece). In truth, and picking up on something I suggested last week, I think I would be enjoying this season a lot more if Spader were positioned as Carell’s replacement, and we were seeing the season from his perspective".|$|E

This paper has addressed the chaos synchronization problem of two chaotic systems using the Nonlinear Control Techniques, based on Lyapunov stability theory. It has been shown that the proposed schemes have outstanding transient performances and that analytically as well as graphically, synchronization is asymptotically globally stable. Suitable feedback controllers are designed to stabilize the closed-loop system at the origin. All simulation results are carried out to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies by using Mathematica 9...|$|E
