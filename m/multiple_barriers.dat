This reordering of memory operations (loads and stores) normally goes unnoticed within a single thread of execution, but can cause unpredictable behaviour in concurrent programs and device drivers unless carefully controlled.

50|$|Chapter 40B {{continues}} to be controversial {{and it has not}} overcome the <b>multiple</b> <b>barriers</b> that exist to building affordable housing in the state. A study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition rated Massachusetts as being the least affordable state in which to rent an apartment in 2003. Despite the law, fewer new affordable housing units are built in Massachusetts compared to the state's needs. The state government as a policy works toward increasing the supply of inexpensive housing. The shortage contributes to sprawl as workers move further away from jobs in order obtain affordably priced houses. The high price of housing is one reason that young adults move away from Massachusetts.|$|E

40|$|Cyanobacteria are a {{major problem}} for the world wide water {{industry}} as they can produce metabolites toxic to humans in addition to taste and odour compounds that make drinking water aesthetically displeasing. Removal of cyanobacterial toxins from drinking water is important to avoid serious illness in consumers. This objective can be confidently achieved through the application of the <b>multiple</b> <b>barrier</b> approach to drinking water quality and safety. In this study the use of a <b>multiple</b> <b>barrier</b> approach incorporating coagulation, powdered activated carbon (PAC) and ultrafiltration (UF) was investigated for the removal of intracellular and extracellular cyanobacterial toxins from two naturally occurring blooms in South Australia. Also investigated was the impact of these treatments on the UF flux. In this multibarrier approach, coagulation was used to remove the cells and thus the intracellular toxin while PAC was used for extracellular toxin adsorption and finally the UF was used for floc, PAC and cell removal. Cyanobacterial cells were completely removed using the UF membrane alone and when used in conjunction with coagulation. Extracellular toxins were removed to varying degrees by PAC addition. UF flux deteriorated dramatically during a trial with a very high cell concentration; however, the flux was improved by coagulation and PAC addition. Mike B.

50|$|There {{are some}} {{technical}} challenges in water reuse, among which are making start-up more economical, questions about water quality standards, {{long-term effects of}} pharmaceutical and household chemicals leftover in the water after treatment (constituents of emerging concern), {{and a lack of}} infrastructure to carry out water reuse. Although there has been little documentation of adverse affects to humans from water reuse contact or consumption, there remains concern about long-term effects of endocrine disrupters, pharmaceuticals, household chemicals, and personal care products in reused water, including impacts on the natural and beneficial microbiota found on and inside people. Treating water to a degree that would be free of these contaminants is expensive, and, for recycled water that is introduced into a groundwater aquifer, it would include the use of <b>multiple</b> <b>barriers</b> and mediums for removal of the microbiological and chemical contaminants. Furthermore, all wastewater that is added to the groundwater supply must be highly treated just in case it has these potentially dangerous contaminants. Monitoring is a critical step in these processes as well.|$|E

About 1.5 million Canadian households or 12.7 per cent of Canadian households were in core housing need.Housing policies across Canada that {{address the issue of}} affordability of housing acknowledge a housing continuum that encourages home ownership and rental in the private sector but also provides rental and/or income assistance to low income households, high level support services to the most vulnerable citizens (frail elderly, disabled, mentally challenged, single parents, etc.) from short-term transitional housing, longer-term supportive housing, to emergency shelters for the homeless. Housing policies and strategies consider repeat users and those who face <b>multiple</b> <b>barriers</b> to meet and maintain core housing needs and therefore provide a wide range of support services including life skills training and assistance programs to break the cycle of poverty (BC Housing Strategy 2006).

50|$|The {{safety of}} ecosan systems {{in terms of}} {{pathogen}} destruction during the various treatment processes is a continuous topic of debate between proponents and opponents of ecosan systems. However, {{the publication of the}} WHO Guidelines on Reuse, with its <b>multiple</b> <b>barrier</b> concept, has gone a long way in establishing a common framework for safe reuse. Nevertheless, the question remains whether ecosan systems can ever be scaled up to reach millions of people and how they can be made sufficiently safe to operate. The initial excitement in the early 2000s by the ecosan pioneers has changed into a realization that changing attitudes and behaviours in sanitation takes a lot of patience.|$|R
40|$|Beginning {{within the}} context of the {{classical}} risk assessment framework, this chapter discusses the origins of risks to microbiological water quality. The importance of a preventative <b>multiple</b> <b>barrier</b> approach is discussed and the advantages of controlling contamination as near to the source as possible are presented briefly. Practical, simple to use approaches are needed to identify risks and manage them at the day-to-day level. The hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) principles are used to illustrate such a process in relation to drinking water. Although the HACCP examples are drawn from drinking water the principles are equally applicable to the recreational water and wastewater reuse areas. A recently proposed management strategy for recreational water is also outlined...|$|R
