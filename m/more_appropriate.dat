5|$|To be able {{to choose}} the <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> {{algorithm}} for each specific problem, it is important to determine both the effectiveness and precision of all the available algorithms.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} a generic local search {{algorithm}} which artificially adds neutrality in search landscapes by discretizing the evaluation function. Some experiments on NK landscapes show that an adaptive discretization is useful to reach high local optima and to launch diversifications automatically. We believe that a hill-climbing using such an adaptive evaluation function could be <b>more</b> <b>appropriated</b> than a clas-sical iterated local search mechanism. ...|$|R

30|$|The non-identification of the {{software}} concerns, especially the crosscutting ones, may bring difficulties for {{the software}} development and evolution processes, harming the reasoning {{of the software}} engineers on the effects caused by the inclusion, removal, or modification of a requirement over the other ones [1]. The aspect-oriented requirements engineering (AORE) area deals with software concerns during the early phases of software development [2, 4], in order to identify, classify, modularize, and compose these concerns in a <b>more</b> <b>appropriated</b> way.|$|R
5|$|Two-level {{utilitarian}}ism (sometimes Government House utilitarianism) is a utilitarian {{theory of}} ethics developed by R. M. Hare. According to the theory, a person's moral decisions {{should be based}} on a set of 'intuitive' moral rules, except in certain rare situations where it is <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> to engage in a 'critical' level of moral reasoning.|$|E
5|$|Although lesbian-feminism was a {{significant}} shift, not all lesbians agreed with it. Lesbian-feminism was a youth-oriented movement: its members were primarily college educated, with experience in New Left and radical causes, but they had not seen any success in persuading radical organizations to take up women's issues. Many older lesbians who had acknowledged their sexuality in more conservative times felt maintaining their ways of coping in a homophobic world was <b>more</b> <b>appropriate.</b> The Daughters of Bilitis folded in 1970 over which direction to focus on: feminism or gay rights issues.|$|E

30|$|The type of {{relationship}} {{addressed by the}} concept “Composition” describes the idea of decomposition of a concern into sub-concerns. This concept is important, because a given concern may be too wide and reducing its granularity may facilitate the reasoning of the software engineers on which concerns are really present in the software and which are the <b>more</b> <b>appropriated</b> strategies for modularizing them. For instance, the “Security” concern may be decomposed into “Authorization,” “Encryption,” among others. There may be the “Authorization” sub-concern in a specific software but not the “Encryption” sub-concern.|$|R
40|$|This work compares two fault {{tolerance}} techniques, Hamming code and Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), that are largely used to mitigate Single Event Upsets in integrated circuits, {{in terms of}} area and performance penalty. Both techniques were implemented in VHDL and tested in two target applications: arithmetic circuits with pipeline and registers files. Area overhead results show that TMR is <b>more</b> <b>appropriated</b> for modules using single registers like in pipelines, control and datapath circuits, while Hamming code is a better trade-off for groups of registers, such as register files, caches and embedded memories. 1...|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{aircraft}} {{industry as a}} whole was becoming increasingly interested in VTOL aircraft. It was expected that any future European war would start with a nuclear exchange that would destroy most airbases, so aircraft would need to operate from limited airbases, roads or even unprepared fields. Considerable research effort was put into various solutions to securing a second-strike capability. Some of these solutions included rocket-launched aircraft like the zero-length launch concept, while many companies started work on VTOL aircraft as a <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> long-term solution.|$|E
5|$|Cinefantastiques Dale Kutzera {{thought the}} episode flowed well, {{and that the}} treknobabble was {{reasonable}} and logical, but that the episode didn't {{make good use of}} the characters. He said that each character fitted a certain role: Neelix was the jealous boyfriend, B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) was the shoot-first Klingon, and Kes was the perky-looking alien sounding board for other characters. Furthermore, Kutzera felt that the themes of the episode were <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> for an early first-season episode, not being as pertinent or believable a year later. He gave the episode 2.5 out of 4 stars.|$|E

30|$|The {{confusion}} matrix provides the general discriminant performance for each feature subset. In {{order to determine}} the <b>more</b> <b>appropriated</b> subset, we used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis [17] to estimate the expected performance of a discriminant function under varying criterion. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve (AUC) are properties used to assess the performance for different number of attributes. The area under ROC Curve (AUC) gauges the ranking of correct class separation. When dealing with a reduced database sample, the area under ROC convex hull (ROCCH) provides the finest grade of the separability for the corrosion classes [17].|$|R
5|$|If the ylide carbon is {{substituted}} with an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), the reagent {{is referred}} to as a stabilized ylide. These, similarly to sulfoxonium reagents, react much slower and are typically easier to prepare. These are limited in their usefulness as the reaction can become prohibitively sluggish: examples involving amides are widespread, with many fewer involving esters and virtually no examples involving other EWG's. For these, the related Darzens reaction is typically <b>more</b> <b>appropriate.</b>|$|E

The two medical schools merged in 1982 and became the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals (UMDS).

5|$|Juventus {{were founded}} as Sport-Club Juventus in late 1897 by pupils from the Massimo D'Azeglio Lyceum school in Turin, but were renamed as Foot-Ball Club Juventus two years later. The club joined the Italian Football Championship during 1900. In 1904, the {{businessman}} Ajmone-Marsan revived the finances {{of the football}} club Juventus, making it also possible to transfer the training field from piazza d'armi to the <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> Velodrome Umberto I.
