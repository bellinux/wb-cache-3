5|$|If the {{earthquake}} had {{occurred during the}} early morning while residents were asleep, rather than mid-afternoon (1:52 pm local time), {{it could have been}} deadlier as housing in the epicentral area consisted chiefly of <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> brick.|$|E
5|$|In this {{flat and}} marshy area, the {{branches}} and roots of mangrove trees form dams where deposits of oyster shells naturally accumulate along with <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> plant detritus.

5|$|The French {{army was}} forced to march through rain and black {{coal-dust}} mud to reach Waterloo, and then to contend with <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> rain as it slept in the open.

5|$|All rock now {{exposed in}} the area of the park is volcanic, but this has not always been the case. For {{hundreds}} of millions of years, the Lassen region underwent repeated uplifting to form mountains, only to have them worn down and submerged under encroaching seas. During the periods of submersion, sand, <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> limestone were deposited. Occasionally volcanic activity was associated with the mountain building.|$|E

5|$|Breeding pairs {{must have}} a {{territory}} of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus aggressively defend a territory and its food resources. Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food resources in the area. The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs, bound with an inner layer of roots, <b>mud,</b> <b>and</b> bark and lined with a softer material, such as deer fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles.|$|E
5|$|Coursed mud {{construction}} {{is one of}} the oldest approaches to building walls. Moist mud is formed by hand to make the base of a wall, and allowed to dry. More mud is added and allowed to dry to form successive courses until the wall is complete. With puddled mud, a hand-made mud form is filled with wetter <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> allowed to dry.|$|E

After this usage of the name Bess, it was retired for the second time and was replaced with Brenda. This marked the only occasion where a single name was removed twice in the same basin.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{a mixture}} of sand and cement {{was applied to the}} {{external}} faces of the mosque with the intention of protecting the mosque from wind and rain damage. However, this treatment resulted in substantial damage to the building as moisture became trapped in the walls built of <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> started a deterioration process of the structure, with termites infesting the wooden supports under humid conditions. This resulted in part of the mosque collapsing and during the repair work it caused some distortions of the structural elements and the exterior of the mosque.|$|E

5|$|Milnrow is {{situated}} at Junction 21 of the trans-Pennine M62 motorway. Construction of the Milnrow {{part of the}} M62 began in April 1967, a process which spread <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> dirt throughout the town. The official opening of the motorway on 13 October 1971 was by Queen Elizabeth II, who was welcomed by Ralph Assheton, 1st Baron Clitheroe {{in his role as}} Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire, as well as the Chairman of Milnrow Urban District Council and his wife. Once opened, the Queen cast aside protocol for an informal meeting with the people of Milnrow.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon, {{with the}} reserves, made a late start on 17 June and joined Ney at Quatre Bras at 13:00 to attack Wellington's army but found the {{position}} empty. The French pursued Wellington's retreating army to Waterloo; however, due to bad weather, <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> {{the head start}} that Napoleon's tardy advance had allowed Wellington, apart from a cavalry action at Genappe, there was no substantial engagement.|$|E
5|$|Omaha had terrible streets {{through the}} late 1880s, which caused many {{residents}} to believe the city was not progressing appropriately. This lack of responsiveness by the city government was caused by property owners throughout the city {{who did not want}} to pay for improvements. On rainy days stagecoaches would sink up to their hubcaps, and residents wore knee-high boots to wade through the <b>mud,</b> <b>and</b> at times rivers ran through the streets.|$|E

5|$|Other common changes {{include the}} {{replacement}} of the factory stock tires with rain tires or <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> snow tires and the shortening of the vehicle's wheelbase to improve maneuverability. For smaller applications smaller trucks are used. In Canada pickup trucks are used with snow removal operations with a blade mounted in front and optional de-icing equipment installed in the rear. Underbody scrapers are also used by some agencies and are mounted between axles, distributing plowing stresses on the chassis more evenly.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{are found}} in both deep oceans and shallow coastal waters worldwide. The {{greatest}} diversity is in the tropics {{although there are many}} species adapted to relatively cold waters. The majority of species cling on to rocks, shells or submerged timber, often hiding in cracks or under seaweed, but some burrow into sand and <b>mud,</b> <b>and</b> a few are pelagic.|$|E
5|$|The 5th Division {{attacked}} {{with three}} battalions through the Scherriabeek valley, which were raked by fire from Gheluvelt {{and found the}} valley to be impassable. Polderhoek Château was captured but then relinquished because many weapons were clogged by <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> the position made an awkward salient. The Germans promptly reoccupied the château, swept the area to the west with massed machine-gun fire and counterattacked, which pushed the brigade back to the start line.|$|E

40|$|The first {{high-resolution}} {{mapping of}} <b>mud</b> volcanoes <b>and</b> <b>mud</b> domes of the Central Mediterranean Ridge (Eastern Mediterranean) presented here {{is based on}} successive in situ observations from the Nautile submersible [MEDINAUT (1998) and NAUTINIL (2003) surveys] and near-bottom side-scan sonar data (MEDINETH cruise, 1999). Data were obtained over two types of clay-kinetic-related features previously identified south of Crete: the Olimpi field <b>mud</b> volcanoes <b>and</b> the Southern belt mud domes, characterized by highly contrasting morpho-acoustic characteristics. Using the new data we can better define the morphological and backscatter characteristics of both <b>mud</b> volcanoes <b>and</b> <b>mud</b> domes <b>and</b> illustrate their similarities and differences; and establish ground truth, {{in terms of the}} presence or not of mud flows, diagenetic carbonate pavements, active seepage and macro-and microbiology. This study reveals strong contrasts between: (1) large mud volcanoes, made of successive <b>mud</b> flows, <b>and</b> associated with diagenetic carbonates and fluid venting activity, <b>and</b> (2) smaller <b>mud</b> domes, characterized by steep slopes affected by sedimentary instabilities, and without any evidence of mud flow, specific fluid seepage activity, authigenic carbonate pavement, or biologic communities. From these results we demonstrate a strong variability of clay-kinetic structures from the central domain of the Mediterranean Ridge accretionary complex to its northern thrust boundary against the Cretan continental backstop. From an integration of the high-resolution results to the Mediterranean Ridge geologic and structural settings, a qualitative model is finally proposed to explain the <b>mud</b> volcano <b>and</b> <b>mud</b> dome emplacement. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
