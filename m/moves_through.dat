5000|$|He {{noted that}} undines {{are similar to}} humans in size, while sylphs are rougher, coarser, longer, and stronger. Gnomes are short, while {{salamanders}} are long, narrow, and lean. The elementals {{are said to be}} able to <b>move</b> <b>through</b> their own elements as human beings <b>move</b> <b>through</b> air. Gnomes, for example, can <b>move</b> <b>through</b> rocks, walls, and soil. Sylphs are the closest to humans in his conception because they <b>move</b> <b>through</b> air like we do, while in fire they burn, in water they drown, and in earth, they get stuck. Paracelsus states that each one stays healthy in its particular [...] "chaos," [...] as he terms it, but dies in the others.|$|R

5|$|Jaws allow fish {{to eat a}} {{wide variety}} of food, {{including}} plants and other organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the esophagus. In the stomach, food is further digested and, in many fish, processed in finger-shaped pouches called pyloric caeca, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the liver and pancreas add enzymes and various chemicals as the food <b>moves</b> <b>through</b> the digestive tract. The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption.|$|E
