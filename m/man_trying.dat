5|$|In Venezuela, {{citizens}} in coastal areas of Falcón, Sucre and Isla Margarita {{were moved to}} safer areas, and several thousands were evacuated due to the hurricane. The Simón Bolívar International Airport, as well as three other mainland airports, were closed. Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. temporarily closed its oil refinery in Curaçao, and two ports were briefly shut down; this caused a delay in two oil deliveries. The Valero Energy Corporation shut down its largest oil refinery in Aruba. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the hurricane, oil companies in Trinidad and Tobago ceased production and removed workers from offshore rigs; the Atlantic LNG company closed exports. Seven shelters were opened on Tobago, where about 560people evacuated for the storm. Two people died: one <b>man</b> <b>trying</b> to save his car, and one girl sleeping in her bed, when a tree fell on the roof above her room. Most evacuees were from low-lying areas, and {{on the day of the}} storm's passage most schools and businesses were closed. The two main airports in the country were closed, with one airline canceling all of its flights.|$|E

25|$|The film centres on Sam Lowry, a <b>man</b> <b>trying</b> {{to find a}} {{woman who}} appears in his dreams while he is working in a mind-numbing job {{and living in a}} small apartment, set in a consumer-driven dystopian world in which there is an over-reliance on poorly {{maintained}} (and rather whimsical) machines. Brazils bureaucratic, totalitarian government is reminiscent of the government depicted in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, except that it has a buffoonish, slapstick quality and lacks a Big Brother figure.|$|E
25|$|The {{counterpart}} to the slave was the dandy, a common {{character in the}} afterpiece. He was a northern urban black <b>man</b> <b>trying</b> to live above his station by mimicking white, upper-class speech and dress—usually to no good effect. Dandy characters often went by Zip Coon, after the song popularized by George Washington Dixon, although others had pretentious names like Count Julius Caesar Mars Napoleon Sinclair Brown. Their clothing was a ludicrous parody of upper-class dress: coats with tails and padded shoulders, white gloves, monocles, fake mustaches, and gaudy watch chains. They spent their time primping and preening, going to parties, dancing and strutting, and wooing women.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the stage}} name Cole Dammett (adapted from his father's stage name, Blackie Dammett), Kiedis landed {{a number of}} small roles in {{television}} and film as a teenager in the late 1970s. His early credits include F.I.S.T. and the 1978 ABC Afterschool Special It's a Mile from Here to Glory. Resuming his acting work in the 1990s, Kiedis appeared in the 1991 Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze vehicle Point Break playing Tone, a surfer. The Chase, a 1994 movie starring Charlie Sheen as an estranged <b>man</b> <b>trying</b> to escape the cops with a young woman he kidnapped, had Flea and Kiedis playing metalheads who chase Sheen's character in a 4×4 truck and end up crashing.|$|E

25|$|After her husband's death, Laura Upthegrove {{lived under}} an assumed name in western Florida for a time. In {{the next two}} years, she was arrested on several {{occasions}} before eventually opening a gas station at Canal Point on Lake Okeechobee. She later {{moved in with her}} mother in Upthegrove Beach. On August 6, 1927, she died during an argument with a <b>man</b> <b>trying</b> to buy moonshine from her. In the heat of the moment, she swallowed a bottle of disinfectant and died within minutes. It is unclear whether it was an accident, as some claim she mistook it for a bottle of gin, but it was widely reported that she had committed suicide. She was 30 years old.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Malden {{starred in}} Skag, an hour-long drama {{that focused on}} the life of a foreman at a Pittsburgh steel mill. Malden {{described}} his character, Pete Skagska, as a simple <b>man</b> <b>trying</b> to keep his family together. The pilot episode for the series had Skag temporarily disabled by a stroke and explored the effects it had on his family and co-workers. While Skag met with poor ratings, critics praised it. In some instances, even full page ads were taken out in newspapers in an attempt to keep the program from being taken off the air. Nevertheless, the series was cancelled after several episodes. In 1987, he was the host/narrator for the second and third television specials that later became the long-running series Unsolved Mysteries.|$|E
25|$|The black humor {{employed}} by Ichikawa has also often {{been the subject}} of comment by others. It has been claimed that Eiji Funakoshi was fundamentally a comic actor. The noted Japanese film critic Tadao Sato points out that Funakoshi does not play his role in Fires on the Plain in the usual style of post-World War II anti-war Japanese films. He does not put on the pained facial expression and the strained walk typical of the genre, but instead staggers confused through the film more like a drunk man. Sato says that this gives the film its black-comic style which results from watching a <b>man</b> <b>trying</b> to maintain his human dignity in a situation which makes this impossible. Quandt notes that Ichikawa's wife, Natto Wada, wrote the script to the film and contributed this sardonic wit. Audie Bock says that this black humor, rather than relieving the bleakness of the film, has the effect of actually heightening the darkness.|$|E

500|$|The 1928 {{version of}} [...] "Good Old Mountain Dew" [...] {{is close to}} the style of a ballad. The lyrics tell the story of a man's first day in court to answer charges of making illegal alcohol. In the first verse, the {{prosecutor}} closes his case. In the next three verses, several respected members of the community—the deacon, the doctor, and the conductor—visit the charged <b>man,</b> <b>trying</b> to buy his whiskey.

500|$|Outliers {{has been}} {{described}} as a form of autobiography, as Gladwell mixes in elements from his own life into the book to give it a more personal touch. Lev Grossman, writing in Time magazine, called Outliers a [...] "more personal book than its predecessors", noting, [...] "If you hold it up to the light, at the right angle, you can read it as a coded autobiography: a successful <b>man</b> <b>trying</b> to figure out his own context, how success happened to him and what it means." [...] He also surmised that Gladwell feels guilty about his success and believes that Christopher Langan should have experienced the same success that he had.|$|E

He investigates rumors that the Church of Scientology reportedly claims to have a [...] "cure" [...] for homosexuality through [...] "auditing", and speaks with a former Scientologist about his experiences. He also explores the casting couch phenomenon, the pornography industry, and the Oscars. Halperin meets with famous actors and celebrities, successfully obtains a talent agent, and {{a role in the}} film The Aviator.|$|E
500|$|With {{less than}} an hour left and still without a confession, the detectives are exhausted, and Tucker turns the table on them. He claims Pembleton has the {{attitude}} of a <b>man</b> <b>trying</b> to distance himself from his African American heritage because he is ashamed to be black. Tucker also accuses Bayliss of hiding a [...] "dark side" [...] inside him that he is afraid to embrace. Eventually, Tucker admits he harbored pedophilic feelings for Adena, and feels shame that the [...] "one great love of my life was an 11-year-old girl". He breaks down and cries, but still insists he did not kill her. The 12-hour time limit elapses and the detectives fail to get a confession. Tucker is released and Bayliss is miserable he was unable to close the case. Pembleton, who has a new respect for Bayliss, tries to comfort him by saying he is now convinced Tucker is the killer, but Bayliss is no longer so sure.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. James Hunt {{reviewed}} the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in January 2013. He was surprised by the episode as he [...] "went in expecting something that was typically season one awful, and got something that was actually a lot of fun". [...] He thought that the theme of symbiosis between man and machine was [...] "interesting", stating it was the best episode up until that point in season one and one of the best of the season overall. Zack Handlen watched the episode for The A.V. Club in May 2010. He too was surprised by what he found. Handlen said that [...] "last time I saw it, I thought Riker and Minuet's interactions were cheesy as hell. They didn't bother me so much now, because they don't go on very long, and there's something hilarious about a <b>man</b> <b>trying</b> to seduce a computer simulation designed to respond to his seductions". But he said, [...] "I had fun with this, which I wasn't expecting", and [...] "thought this was solid". He gave the episode a B grade.|$|E

500|$|Into Temptation {{marks the}} second film by {{independent}} filmmaker Patrick Coyle, who {{wrote and directed}} the 2003 drama film Detective Fiction. Coyle said Into Temptation was partially inspired by his father, James Patrick Coyle, a kind but belligerent {{man who had been}} encouraged by his mother to become a priest. James entered seminary but dropped out before ordination after he was drafted into serving overseas in World War II and met Margaret Mary Quinlan, who would become his wife and Patrick Coyle's mother. Coyle conceived of the script for Into Temptation while imagining what kind of priest his father would have been. His father strongly approved of the project, and told Coyle, [...] "Go make that movie. And tell the truth." [...] Coyle was also partially inspired by his childhood pastor and friend, the Reverend Damian Zuerlein, who performed the marriage ceremony for Coyle and his wife and baptized their children. Coyle said of him, [...] "He's just a young, energetic, competent, committed, devoted man working with a poor parish. And he loves his work. I was inspired by that." [...] Coyle said when writing Into Temptation, he did not intend to make a religious film, and said of protagonist Father John Buerlein, [...] "The character could have been a minister or a rabbi or a public defender. He's a good <b>man</b> <b>trying</b> to do a job the best he can." ...|$|E
500|$|The season {{also saw}} {{several of the}} show's cast write their own episodes. Series co-star Gillian Anderson {{directed}} and wrote her first episode of the series, [...] "all things". Anderson originally approached Carter about writing and directing an episode of the series during the sixth season. Anderson crafted a script that would see Scully pursuing a [...] "deeply personal X-File, one which in [...] is taken down a spiritual path when logic fails her". Anderson had only a rough outline of the script until one day she wrote {{a majority of the}} story in one sitting. She explained, [...] "A certain concept began to form, [...] I just wrote the entire outline for 'all things' right then and there. It all just kind of came together on the page". The next day, Anderson pitched the script to Carter, who approved of the [...] "personal and quiet" [...] characteristics of the story. In addition, series regular Davis wrote his only episode, [...] "En Ami". Davis approached Carter with his idea about Cigarette Smoking <b>Man</b> <b>trying</b> to seduce Scully with medical knowledge, and Carter, who was intrigued, responded positively to the idea. He assigned executive producer Spotnitz to work with Davis and craft a full-fledged script. The script went through many revisions. Because Cigarette Smoking Man was able to manipulate Scully, Carter later referred to the [...] "En Ami" [...] as [...] "the creepiest episode of the year." ...|$|E
500|$|Joshua Rich from Entertainment Weekly {{had mixed}} {{views on the}} {{prospect}} of Michael returning in season four, because although Perrineau {{was one of his}} [...] "favorite" [...] actors, he liked how peaceful the series had become without Michael constantly screaming [...] "Walt!". IGN's Chris Carabott called Michael's return [...] "the worst kept secret in Lost history", but still found his reveal [...] "exciting". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger found [...] "a fine performance from Mr. Perrineau" [...] in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson". Sepinwall wrote that Michael's [...] "struggle to deal with the guilt from his Faustian bargain to save Walt was another moving example of how the writers this season are really trying to build on the emotional impact of everything that's happened before." [...] Cynthia Littleton of Variety was [...] "really happy" [...] to see Michael again, and wrote [...] "Perrineau plays it just right most of the time—no hysterics or scenery-chewing, just a <b>man</b> <b>trying</b> to do the right thing, most of the time." [...] Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones commented that [...] " [...] suicidal plight was well conveyed and there were plenty of shocks and thrills along the way". Before the fourth season finale aired, Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen ranked Michael being unable to commit suicide as the thirteenth best moment of the season, but did add [...] "This story line didn't match the hype". Oscar Dahl from BuddyTV called Michael's death [...] "the culmination of a fairly lackluster story arc".|$|E
