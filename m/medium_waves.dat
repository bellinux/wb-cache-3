50|$|Listeners {{can hear}} the {{broadcasts}} via headsets connected to the internal hospital network, or on a normal radio by tuning to 1278 kHz on the <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> band, <b>medium</b> <b>Wave</b> is not available at Doncaster.|$|R
50|$|Because {{at these}} {{frequencies}} atmospheric noise is {{far above the}} receiver signal to noise ratio, inefficient antennas much smaller than a wavelength {{can be used for}} receiving. For reception at frequencies below 1.6 MHz, which includes long and <b>medium</b> <b>waves,</b> loop antennas are popular because of their ability to reject locally generated noise. By far the most common antenna for broadcast reception is the ferrite-rod antenna, also known as a loopstick antenna. The high permeability ferrite core allows it to be compact enough to be enclosed inside the radio's case and still have adequate sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|At {{times in}} the 1980s, in order to protest the Reagan administration's Cuba policy and its {{instigation}} of the anti-Castro Radio Martí program from the Voice of America, Radio Havana Cuba broadcast briefly on mediumwave frequencies at a greatly boosted power allowing the station to be heard on American AM radios and overwhelming local American AM stations broadcasting on that frequency, including clear channel station WHO in Des Moines, Iowa on 1040 kHz. RHC no longer transmits on <b>medium</b> <b>waves</b> , even though Radio Martí still transmits from the United States to Cuba on 1180 kHz.|$|E
50|$|<b>Medium</b> <b>waves</b> {{can also}} reflect off charged {{particle}} layers in the ionosphere {{and return to}} Earth at much greater distances; {{this is called the}} skywave. At night, especially in winter months and at times of low solar activity, the lower ionospheric D layer virtually disappears. When this happens, MF radio waves can easily be received many hundreds or even thousands of miles away as the signal will be reflected by the higher F layer. This can allow very long-distance broadcasting, but can also interfere with distant local stations. Due to the limited number of available channels in the MW broadcast band, the same frequencies are re-allocated to different broadcasting stations several hundred miles apart. On nights of good skywave propagation, the skywave signals of distant station may interfere with the signals of local stations on the same frequency. In North America, the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) sets aside certain channels for nighttime use over extended service areas via skywave by a few specially licensed AM broadcasting stations. These channels are called clear channels, and they are required to broadcast at higher powers of 10 to 50 kW.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the start}} of the 1950s, {{sponsorship}} of the English service had begun to grow once more, and while initially some of the English-language programmes continued via Radio Luxembourg I on long wave, a second but less powerful wavelength was opened up as Radio Luxembourg II on <b>medium</b> <b>wave.</b> The English programmes of Radio Luxembourg moved on July 2, 1951 from long <b>wave</b> to the <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> frequency of 208 metres (1439kHz). The controversy over the station's broadcasting frequencies had been resolved with the 1948 Copenhagen plan (which this time the Luxembourg government did sign), which allocated the country two high-power frequencies, one on long wave and the other on <b>medium</b> <b>wave.</b> Eventually all English programming moved to <b>medium</b> <b>wave,</b> with long wave being dedicated to French programmes, [...] while German, Dutch and other languages used <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> during the daytime.|$|R
50|$|Diplexers {{are also}} used at <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> {{broadcasting}} stations. However their use is not that common in this frequency range because the corresponding wavelength varies much more across the <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> band than across the FM band {{and so it is}} more practicable to use a separate antenna for each frequency: <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> transmission sites usually broadcast only on one to four frequencies, while FM-broadcasting sites often uses four and more frequencies.|$|R
5000|$|In Europe, where {{a second}} AM {{broadcast}} band {{is used for}} longwave broadcasting, tuners may be fitted with both the standard <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> and the additional longwave band. However, radios with only <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> are also common, especially in countries {{where there are no}} longwave broadcasters. Rarely, radios are sold with only FM and longwave, but no <b>medium</b> <b>wave</b> band. Some tuners may also be equipped with one or more short wave bands.|$|R

50|$|Generally tourist {{facilities}} are very basic and rustic. Food service, generally under palapas, open-air restaurants with thatched roofs, is common, but accommodations are sparse. One change to encourage tourism was to replace many speed bumps on Highway 200 {{and other major}} roads with devices that make the car vibrate instead to control speed. These roads are now also regularly patrolled by the Mexican federal police, which {{has been trying to}} control an increased incidence of highway robbery.Chautengo is a large lagoon in the Cruz Grande municipality. Most economic activity is based on fishing, but there are some palapas and food service at the Pico del Monte beach, which is next to where the lagoon opens to the sea. La Bocana is a long beach facing open ocean with a small navigable estuary where the Marquelia River empties into the Pacific Ocean. The area is filled with palapa restaurants as the beach is popular with locals. La Peñitas has two small bays facing the ocean, and one mostly closed off and protected by a strip of land. Accommodations in small bungalows is available along with restaurants. Barra de Tecoanapa is next to the mouth of the Quetzala River. It has beaches facing the ocean. Playa Ventura is in the municipality of Marquelia. This is a small bay facing open ocean with a long beach and <b>medium</b> <b>waves.</b> Unlike other beaches in the area, this is relatively developed with houses, restaurants and hotels made of cinderblock and concrete, painted in bright colors. Hotel services are basic and camping is permitted.|$|E
5000|$|Daytime vs Nighttime: In {{the medium}} {{frequency}} {{portion of the}} radio spectrum where most AM broadcasting is allocated, signals propagate full-time via groundwave and, at nighttime, via skywave as well. This means that during the nighttime hours, co-channel interference exists on many AM radio frequencies due to the <b>medium</b> <b>waves</b> reflecting off the ionosphere and being bounced back down to earth. In the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Bahamas, there are international agreements on certain frequencies which allocate [...] "clear-channel" [...] broadcasting for certain stations to either have their respective frequencies to themselves at night, or to share their respective frequencies with other stations located over hundreds or even thousands of miles away. On other frequencies, there are [...] "Regional Channels" [...] where most stations on these frequencies either reduce power or change to a directional antenna system at nighttime to help reduce co-channel interference to each other's signals. In the United States, there are six [...] "Local Channel" [...] frequencies, also known as [...] "graveyarders" [...] where nearly every station on those frequencies has the same power and antenna pattern both day and night and, {{as a result of}} skywave propagation, there is normally massive co-channel interference in rural areas on these frequencies, often making it difficult, if not impossible, to understand what's being said on the nearest local station on the respective channel, or the other distant stations which are bouncing on the same channel, during the nighttime hours. Skywave has been used for long distance AM radio reception since radio's inception and should not be construed as a negative aspect of AM radio. FCC deregulation allowed many new AM radio stations on the former clear and regional channel designations; this is the principal cause of overcrowding on the AM band at night. A new source of interference on the AM broadcast band is the new digital broadcast system called HD, any AM station that broadcasts HD superimposes digital [...] "hash" [...] on its adjacent channels. This is especially apparent at night as some stations, for example WBZ transmits its 30 kHz wide signal for hundreds of miles at night causing documented interference and covering another station on an adjoining frequency (WYSL 1040) as far as 400 miles away.|$|E

40|$|Wave {{patterns}} in lambskin hair follicles {{are an important}} factor determining the quality of sheep's wool. Hair follicles in lambskin from Hu sheep, a breed unique to China, have 3 types of waves, designated as large, medium, and small. The quality of wool from small wave follicles is excellent, while the quality of large waves is considered poor. Because no molecular and biological studies on hair follicles of these sheep have been conducted to date, the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of different wave patterns is currently unknown. The aim {{of this article was}} to screen the candidate microRNAs (miRNA) and genes for the development of hair follicles in Hu sheep. Two-day-old Hu lambs were selected from full-sib individuals that showed large, medium, and small waves. Integrated analysis of microRNA and mRNA expression profiles employed high-throughout sequencing technology. Approximately 13, 24, and 18 differentially expressed miRNAs were found between small and large waves, small and <b>medium</b> <b>waves,</b> and medium and large waves, respectively. A total of 54, 190, and 81 differentially expressed genes were found between small and large waves, small and <b>medium</b> <b>waves,</b> and medium and large waves, respectively, by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Differentially expressed genes were classified using gene ontology and pathway analyses. They were found to be mainly involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, growth, immune response, and ion transport, and were associated with MAPK and the Notch signaling pathway. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses of differentially-expressed miRNA and genes were consistent with sequencing results. Integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression indicated that, compared to small waves, large waves included 4 downregulated miRNAs that had regulatory effects on 8 upregulated genes and 3 upregulated miRNAs, which in turn influenced 13 downregulated genes. Compared to small waves, <b>medium</b> <b>waves</b> included 13 downregulated miRNAs that had regulatory effects on 64 upregulated genes and 4 upregulated miRNAs, which in turn had regulatory effects on 22 downregulated genes. Compared to <b>medium</b> <b>waves,</b> large waves consisted of 13 upregulated miRNAs that had regulatory effects on 48 downregulated genes. These differentially expressed miRNAs and genes may {{play a significant role in}} forming different patterns, and provide evidence for the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of hair follicles of varying patterns...|$|E

30|$|Consequently, {{vertically}} {{transverse isotropy}} (VTI), {{which is the}} simplest and most practical anisotropic model typically used to describe sand/shale sequences, has become standard model in the anisotropic analysis of seismic data especially, in AVO analysis (Backus 1962; Li and Pickford 2002). In this type of <b>medium,</b> <b>waves</b> generally travel faster in the horizontal direction, than in the vertical direction. Anisotropy increases with offset (incident angle) and has considerable effects on the amplitude of reflections. The magnitude of anisotropy is dependent on Thomsen (1986) dimensionless anisotropy parameters epsilon (ε) and delta (σ) of the overburden for a compressional wave incident on transversely isotropic media, which determines {{the strength of the}} AVO response.|$|E
