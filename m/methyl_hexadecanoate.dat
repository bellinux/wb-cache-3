Despite {{the research on}} B. oleae female pheromones has a long history, only few components (mainly 1, 7 -dioxaspiro[5. 5]undecane) have been deeply investigated. Detailed evidences about the chemical identity and bioactivity of several others C 10 –C 18 molecules produced in female rectal glands are lacking. We conducted GC and GC/EI–MS, identifying nine sex-specific chemicals and an additional compound [ethyl(Z) - 9 -octadecenoate], less abundant in females over males.

Meanwhile, in a second moment, this study evaluated {{the effects of the}} EPMG on the levels of amino acids in the hippocampus, and the mechanism of sedative and anxiolytic action. Adult mice were treated with doses of 200, 300, and 400 [*]mg/kg and evaluated in open field, elevated plus-maze, light dark, and rotarod tests. Moreover, in the behavioral tests diazepam (GABAergic anxiolytic, 2 [*]mg/kg) as positive control and flumazenil (GABA antagonist, 2. 5 [*]mg/kg) were used to identify mechanism of sedative and anxiolytic action produced by EPMG.

40|$|High {{pressure}} phase equilibria measurements of long chain saturated methyl esters (methyl decanoate, methyl dodecanoate, methyl tetradecanoate, <b>methyl</b> <b>hexadecanoate,</b> methyl octadecanoate and methyl docosanoate) in supercritical ethane have been measured for temperatures between 312 K and 355 K and for methyl ester mass fractions from 0. 65 to 0. 018. The results show a generally linear {{relationship between the}} phase equilibria pressure and the temperature with complete mutual solubility above 17 MPa. No three-phase regions or temperature inversions (change in sign of gradient of temperature-pressure relationship at constant composition) were observed while maxima in the phase transition pressures were found for methyl ester mass fractions usually between 0. 2 and 0. 3. When the phase transition pressure is plotted {{as a function of}} carbon number at constant temperature and mass fraction methyl ester, a linear relationship is realised. This linear relationship can be used to determine the solubility of any saturated methyl ester with between 10 and 22 carbon atoms, with limited extrapolation being possible. Thermodynamic modelling of the measured phase equilibria with the sPC-SAFT and Peng Robinson equations of state showed that, even with the use of an interaction parameter, these equations of state are not able to model the phase behaviour and the linear pressure-carbon numbers provide more accurate predictions. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Background & objectives: The {{pathogenicity}} of the nosocomial pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii {{is regulated}} by their quorum sensing (QS) systems. The {{objective of the}} present study was to examine the effect of the cold ethyl acetate extract of Tinospora cordifolia stem on virulence and biofilm development in the wild type and clinical strains of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. The study was further aimed to identify the probable active constituents in the plant extract. Methods: P. aeruginosa virulence factors viz., LasA protease, LasB elastase and pyocyanin production were analyzed spectrophotometrically. Biofilm formation was studied using crystal violet staining-microtitre plate assay. The plant extract was fractionated using silica gel column chromatography and the most active fraction was derivatized using silylation and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In silico testing of the molecules identified in GC-MS was performed, for binding to the P. aeruginosa LasI and LasR proteins, to predict the QS inhibitory molecules. Results: The plant extract inhibited three major virulence factors in P. aeruginosa; it exhibited enhanced biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa while decreased biofilm development in A. baumannii. The most active fraction obtained from column chromatography, exhibited suppression of virulence as well as biofilm in both the organisms. Docking scores were calculated for all the molecules identified in GC-MS, and high docking scores were obtained for 2, 3, 4 -triacetyloxybutyl acetate, methyl 16 -methyl heptadecanoate, 2 -(5 -ethenyl- 5 -methyloxolan- 2 -yl) propan- 2 -ol, <b>methyl</b> <b>hexadecanoate</b> and 2 -methoxy- 4 -vinyl phenol. Interpretation & conclusions: The compounds showing high docking scores could probably be the QS inhibitors.

40|$|Soil is {{composed}} of various minerals with variable amounts of organic matter that absorb many pollutants, which can be difficult and expensive to remove. High energy ball milling is an effective and cheap way of remediating contaminated soil. Research {{has shown that the}} initial step in the process is predominantly the ionization of the polluting organic molecules to form a radical. This radical initiates a chain reaction, thus destroying the organic pollutant. The site(s) of ionization on the organic molecule has yet to be identified. Initial studies using diesel and some small molecules suggested that the ionization potential of the molecule is important, but the volatility of these small molecules had made these results uncertain. In this study, a range of large organic molecules with low volatilities has been investigated. These molecules contained a range of functional groups and were milled in quartz to determine their destruction rates. This enabled the investigation of whether destruction rates are dependent on the functional group or the main carbon chain in the organic compounds. Whether ionization is the major initiator was investigated as well. It was found that the functional group does in fact {{play a major role in}} the destruction rates of the compounds. In order of destruction difficulty: The most difficult to destroy was found to be the alkene hexadecane then in order of increasing ease of destruction: hexadecanone, hexadecanol, <b>methyl</b> <b>hexadecanoate,</b> hexadecanoyl chloride, propyl hexadecanoate, ethyl hexadecanoate, hexadecanoic acid, hexadecylamine, decyl hexadecanoate, hexadecane and the fastest was n-ethylhexadecanamide. Comparison of the destruction rates with the ionization energies of the functional groups showed, a modest relationship. While the ionization of the functional group does play a part, destruction is clearly a more complicated process...|$|E

In total, 86 compounds representing 89. 9 - 94. 9 % of the whole oil composition, were identified in these oils by GC-FID and GC/MS analyses. The root essential oil was clearly distinguished for its high content in sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (β-caryophyllene, 1 (44); 24. 1 % and germacrene D, 2 (53); 20. 0 %), while those obtained from pods, leaves, stems, and flowers were dominated by non-terpene hydrocarbons. The most important ones were n-tetradecane (41, 16. 3 %, pod oil), 1, 7 -dimethylnaphthalene (43, 15. 6 %, leaf oil), and n-octadecane (77, 13. 1 %, stem oil).
