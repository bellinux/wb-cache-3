50|$|SMA is {{available}} in {{a broad range of}} molecular weights and <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (<b>MA)</b> contents. In a typical combination of those two properties, SMA {{is available}} as a crystal clear granule {{that can be used in}} a wide variety of applications. SMA polymers with a high molecular weight are widely used in engineering plastic applications, normally in the impact modified and optional glass fibre filled variants. Alternatively, SMA is applied using its transparency in combination with other transparent materials like PMMA or the heat resistancy to heat-boost other polymers materials like ABS or PVC. The solubility of SMA in alkaline solutions makes it suitable for various applications in the field of sizings (paper), binders, dispersants and coatings. The specific reactivity of SMA makes it a suitable agent for compatibilizing normally incompatible polymers (e.g. ABS/PA blends) or cross-linking.The glass transition temperature of Styrene maleic anhydride is 130 - 160 °C.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} polyolefins with {{different}} ethene/propene ratios was grafted with <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (<b>MA)</b> {{both in the}} melt and in solution.

The MA graft content is low for polyolefins with high propene content, increases as the propene content decreases and reaches a plateau at propene levels below 50 wt. %. Branching/crosslinking occurs for polyolefins with low propene content, while degradation is the main side reaction for polyolefins with a high propene content.

The formulations were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In the case of THA modified polyolefins, the time of reaction and the interaction between time of reaction and THA concentration influenced the process, whereas the MA and BPO concentrations influenced the grafting of MA onto polyolefins. THA and MA modified polyolefin samples with similar grafting contents were analized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). THA and MA functionalized polyolefins presented reduction in the melting temperature of 4. 3 °C and 1. 4 °C, respectively, comparing with the original polymer. These effects corroborate with the strong reduction in the areas of the diffraction peaks (110) and (200) after the grafting process...|$|R

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of n-butane to <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> {{was investigated}} over {{a series of}} model-supported vanadia catalysts where the vanadia phase was present as a two-dimensional metal oxide overlayer on the different oxide supports (TiO 2, ZrO 2, CeO 2, Nb 2 O 5, Al 2 O 3, and SiO 2). No correlation {{was found between the}} properties of the terminal V==O bond and the butane oxidation turnover frequency (TOF) during in situ Raman spectroscopy study. Furthermore, neither the n-butane oxidation TOF nor <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> selectivity was related to the extent of reduction of the surface vanadia species. The n-butane oxidation TOF was essentially independent of the surface vanadia coverage, suggesting that the n-butane activation requires only one surface vanadia site. The <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> TOF, however, increased by a factor of 2 – 3 as the surface vanadia coverage was increased to monolayer coverage. The higher <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> TOF at near monolayer coverages suggests that a pair of adjacent vanadia sites may efficiently oxidize n-butane to <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride,</b> but other factors may also play a contributing role (increase in surface Brønsted acidity and {{decrease in the number of}} exposed support cation sites). Varying the specific oxide support changed the n-butane oxidation TOF by ca. 50 (Ti>Ce>Zr Nb>Al>Si) as well as the <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> selectivity. The <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> selectivity closely followed the Lewis acid strength of the oxide support cations, Al> Nb> Ti> Si> Zr> Ce. The addition of acidic surface metal oxides (W, Nb, and P) to the surface vanadia layer was found to have a beneficial effect on the n-butane oxidation TOF and the <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> selectivity.

40|$|The {{addition}} of benzyltrimethylsilane to <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> mediated by TiO 2 photocatalysis was initially investigated. The affect {{of changing the}} catalyst, the radical trap loading and the substitution of the benzyltrimethylsilane molecule was assessed. Cyclisation precursors based on benzyltrimethylsilane were prepared, but were found not to cyclise via TiO 2 photocatalysis. A number of other systems were assessed {{for their ability to}} cyclise under TiO 2 photocatalysis; tertiary amines, aminomethyltrimethylsilanes, phenoxymethyltrimethylsilanes and phenoxyacetic acids. Phenoxymethyltrimethylsilane and phenoxyacetic acid were found to add effectively to <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> under TiO 2 photocatalysis conditions, however they were unreactive with regards to cyclisation. EPR spectroscopy has been employed to characterise further the reaction of benzylsilanes with <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> under TiO 2 photocatalytic conditions. A number of EPR active species were observed; trapped holes and electrons, which reside within the TiO 2 catalyst. In addition, methyl and benzyl radicals were observed and were found to originate from the oxidation of the benzylsilanes by trapped holes in the TiO 2 catalyst. However, no radical species were observed from the <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride.</b> These observations had the following consequences for the currently proposed reaction mechanism for the {{addition of}} benzyltrimethylsilane with <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> under TiO 2 photocatalysis.  The observation of the benzyl radical definitely proved that the reactive intermediate was indeed the proposed benzyl radical  The absence of any <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> EPR active species cast doubt on the role of <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> as an electron trap.
