2500|$|The route {{includes}} unstable {{areas such}} as Trebanos, liable to landslide and earthquake due to extensive historic mineworkings, which are deemed too dangerous for mains gas to be piped to local homes. Local people raised concerns and permission was denied in November 2006, but the pipeline was still laid in the area. As one local said: [...] "If there was a shift or a landslip again, <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the pipe would fracture, and we'd get an enormous gas leak." [...] National Grid claimed that the pipeline would be secure. An undiscovered Roman road was found during {{the building of the}} pipeline near Brecon and was partially destroyed as a result.|$|E
2500|$|On December 9, Brian Chase {{admitted}} he had posted the false biography to Wikipedia {{because he believed}} Wikipedia to be [...] "some sort of joke Web site." [...] After confessing, Chase was fired from his job at Rush Delivery. Seigenthaler received a hand-written apology and spoke with Chase on the phone. Seigenthaler confirmedas he had previously statedthat he would not file a lawsuit {{in relation to the}} incident, and urged Rush Delivery to rehire Chase, which it did. Seigenthaler commented: [...] "I'm glad this aspect of it is over." [...] He stated that he was concerned that [...] "every biography on Wikipedia is going to be hit by this stuffthink what they'd do to Tom DeLay and Hillary Clinton, to mention two. <b>My</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we're going to get government regulation of the Internet as a result." ...|$|E

60|$|What would I {{not have}} given then for one word with that honest and {{faithful}} friend of our family, Captain Daniel! I {{knew that he}} suspected Grafton: {{he had told me}} as much that night at the Coffee House.

You {{do not know}} yet how much you have gone through. <b>My</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> you will feel {{it all the more}} painfully when the {{excitement}} is past.

6000|$|I do {{not doubt}} the play's being well received, but <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{these people would}} be looked upon as mere abstractions, and would have but a cold welcome in consequence, and would not lay hold of your {{audience}}. Now, when you have laid hold of your audience and have accustomed them to your theatre, you may produce [...] "The White Rose," [...] with far greater justice to the author, and to the manager also. Wait. Feel your way. Perkin Warbeck is too far removed from analogy with the sympathies and {{lives of the people}} for a beginning.|$|E

I'm surprised, amazed, sir, I may say.... But, Mr. Belding, what I want to know most is about my son. I'm broken in health. I've worried myself ill over him. I don't mind telling you, sir, that we quarreled. I laughed at his threats. He went away. And I've come to see that I didn't know Richard. I was wrong to upbraid him. For a year we've known nothing of his doings, and now for almost six months we've not heard from him at all. Frankly, Mr. Belding, I {{weakened}} first, and I've come to hunt him up. <b>My</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I didn't start soon enough.

60|$|I am holiday-making until Friday, when {{we start}} on the round of travel that is to bring us back here for the 1st of April. My holiday-making is simply {{thorough}} resting, except on Wednesday, when I dine with Longfellow. There is still great political excitement, but I hope it may not hurt us very much. <b>My</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it may damage the farewell. Dolby is not of my mind as to this, and I hope he may be right. We are not quite determined whether Mrs. Fields did not desert our colours, by coming {{on the ground in}} a carriage, and having bread soaked in brandy put into the winning man's mouth as he steamed along. She pleaded that she would have done as much for Dolby, if he had been ahead, so we are inclined to forgive her. As she had done so much for me in the way of flowers, I thought I would show her a sight in that line at the dinner. You never saw anything like it. Two immense crowns; the base, of the choicest exotics; and the loops, oval masses of violets. In the centre of the table an immense basket, overflowing with enormous bell-mouthed lilies; all round the table a bright green border of wreathed creeper, with clustering roses at intervals; a rose for every button-hole, and a bouquet for every lady. They made an exhibition of the table before dinner to numbers of people.|$|E

6000|$|I could quote {{others just}} {{as strong as}} these, in some of which the above phrase [...] "complementary" [...] also appears, while I have not a single case in which my correspondents speak of {{originally}} dissimilar characters having become assimilated through identity of nurture. However, a somewhat exaggerated estimate of dissimilarity {{may be due to}} the tendency of relatives to dwell unconsciously on distinctive peculiarities, and to disregard the far more numerous points of likeness that would first attract the notice of a stranger. Thus in case 11 I find the remark, [...] "Strangers see a strong likeness between them, but none who knows them well can perceive it." [...] Instances are common of slight acquaintances mistaking members, and especially daughters of a family, for one another, between whom intimate friends can barely discover a resemblance. Still, making reasonable allowance for unintentional exaggeration, the impression that all this evidence leaves on the mind is one of some wonder whether nurture can do anything at all, beyond giving instruction and professional training. It emphatically corroborates and goes far beyond the conclusions to which we had already been driven by the cases of similarity. In those, the causes of divergence began to act about the period of adult life, when the characters had become somewhat fixed; but here the causes conducive to assimilation began to act from the earliest moment of the existence of the twins, when the disposition was most pliant, and they were continuous until the period of adult life. There is no escape from the conclusion that nature prevails enormously over nurture when the differences of nurture do not exceed what is commonly to be found among persons of the same rank of society and in the same country. <b>My</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> my evidence may seem to prove too much, and be discredited on that account, as it appears contrary to all experience that nurture should go for so little. But experience is often fallacious in ascribing great effects to trifling circumstances. Many a person has amused himself with throwing bits of stick into a tiny brook and watching their progress; how they are arrested, first by one chance obstacle, then by another; and again, how their onward course is facilitated by a combination of circumstances. He might ascribe much importance to each of these events, and think how largely the destiny of the stick had been governed by a series of trifling accidents. Nevertheless all the sticks succeed in passing down the current, and in the long-run, they travel at nearly the same rate. So it is with life, in respect to the several accidents which seem to have had a great effect upon our careers. The one element, that varies in different individuals, but is constant in each of them, is the natural tendency; it corresponds to the current in the stream, and inevitably asserts itself.|$|E

5000|$|Regarding {{the meaning}} of the song, Matthew Bellamy has said: [...] "It's about a semi-fear of the {{evolution}} of technology, and how in reality it's destroying all humanity. <b>My</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we can't control it because it's moving faster than we are, so the song's setting myself in a location in the future where the body is no longer important and everyone's plugged into a network.

5000|$|Voutas {{has spoken}} in {{interviews}} about film censorship in China, saying [...] "I'd love to keep making movies China, my dilemma {{is whether a}} script can be passed by the censors without having its wings clipped. <b>My</b> <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> increasingly censors are the directors of films, and that directors and producers, fearing cuts, then self-censor themselves from the get-go.

He also performed, at intervals, upon a cornet which he had brought with him. This was a very wise thing to do, but, for some reason or other, such music, in a fog, depressed my spirits; however, as it seemed quite suitable to the condition of my affairs I did not interfere, and the notes of Bonnie Doon or My Old Kentucky Home continued to be soaked into the fog.|$|R
