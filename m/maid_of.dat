5|$|From {{the figure}} of the artist, the viewer's eye leaps again diagonally into the {{pictorial}} space. Another man stands, echoing and opposing the form of the artist, outside rather than inside, made clearly defined and yet barely identifiable by the light and shade. The positioning of such an area of strong tonal contrast right {{at the rear of the}} pictorial space is a daring compositional tactic. The shapes of bright light are similar to the irregular light shapes of the foreground <b>Maid</b> <b>of</b> Honour, but the sharply defined door-frame repeats the border of the mirror.|$|E

5|$|Mírzá Husayn `Alí Núrí {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{followers}} of the Báb, and later took the title of Bahá'u'lláh. Bábís faced a period of persecution that peaked in 1852-53 after a few individuals made a failed attempt to assassinate the Shah. Although they acted alone, the government responded with collective punishment, killing many Bábís. Bahá'u'lláh was put in prison. He claimed that in 1853, while incarcerated in the dungeon of the Síyáh-Chál in Tehran, he received the first intimations that he was the one anticipated by the Báb when he received a visit from the <b>Maid</b> <b>of</b> Heaven.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{became a}} {{follower}} of the Báb in Persia in 1845. Three years after the Báb was executed, he was exiled to Baghdad (then {{a part of the}} Ottoman Empire), where in 1863 he proclaimed the Bahá'í Faith when he declared himself He whom God shall make manifest, a messianic figure in Babi theology. Bahá'u'lláh based this announcement on a vision of the <b>Maid</b> <b>of</b> Heaven he claimed to have had while imprisoned in the Síyáh-Chál in Tehran, Persia. He would be further exiled to Edirne and ultimately to the prison city of Acre, Palestine (present-day Israel), where he died.
