The chapters in Digital Writing Assessment & Evaluation place emphasis on assessment of digital writing—the methodological, technological, and ethical approaches for and issues involved with assessing <b>multimodal,</b> <b>networked</b> texts (and the student learning they represent). Authors address questions such as:How do different approaches to assessing traditional writing (8 1 / 2 x 11 word-centric texts) port—or not—to the assessment of digital writing? What challenges and opportunities for assessment do <b>multimodal,</b> <b>networked</b> texts present to teachers, program administrators, state-wide organizations, etc. ?What material and technological resources are needed when assessing digital writing and/or how might existing resources need to be modified?How are processes and products of selection, collection, and reflection different (or not) with the multimodal affordances of digital technologies?How do guidelines and outcomes of groups such as CCCC, NCTE, WPA, AAC&U, impact approaches to assessment?

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{we deal with}} {{shortest}} paths {{in the context of}} urban passenger mobility. In particular, we present a novel shortest path algorithm on <b>multimodal</b> <b>networks,</b> where the objective function may consist of different components, such as monetary cost, time and discomfort paid by users when changing modality. The key feature of the proposed algorithm is that it focuses on the modal change nodes and forces as much as possible routings through those nodes that could be profitably selected as commuting points. Since modal change nodes play a relevant role in the choice of the route, we evaluate the performance of such nodes with the aim of increasing their attractiveness, thus minimizing the generalized cost of the multimodal routes. The underlying model fits in the class of multi – weighted graph approach, where here weights are associated with both arcs and nodes of the multimodal digraph. Resultsof a computational experimentation aimed at validating the proposed algorithm with different sized <b>multimodal</b> <b>networks</b> are reported, together with a case study related to the city of Genoa, Italy.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{exploration}} into {{the analysis of}} public transport networks using space syntax approaches combined with concepts of sustainable accessibility. Present urban development policy aims to achieve sustainable mobility patterns, shifting mobility to soft transportation modes such as walking and cycling, supported by a more integrated multi?modal public transport system, and understanding how different urban areas can support this objective is an important urban policy and design task. We propose that the description of urban areas in terms of ‘modal environments’ is useful to understand the mobility patterns of their populations. We explore this hypothesis by characterising the neighbourhoods in the Randstad region of the Netherlands {{in terms of public}} transport ‘modal environments’ by measuring the centrality of the public transport infrastructure of the city?region, and compare their centrality to the mobility patterns of the population. The <b>multi?modal</b> <b>network</b> model of the Randstad includes the three main public transport networks, namely rail, tram and metro/light rail, and it is a simple topological undirected network where the stations or stops represent nodes in the graph and the mobility infrastructure defines the links. In order to create a <b>multimodal</b> <b>network</b> we introduce a fourth set of links representing modal interfaces that make the connection between the nodes of the different public transport modes. We then measure the degree, closeness and betweenness centrality of this network and correlate the results with the data of the 2008 Mobility Survey of the Netherlands, aggregated at neighbourhood level. Although the centrality of the <b>multi?modal</b> <b>network</b> does not fully explain the patterns of public transport use in the different neighbourhoods, it seems to offer a possibility of characterising those neighbourhoods in terms of their public transport use potential, i. e. to what extent they can be public transport ‘modal environments’. The realisation of this potential is dependent on other factors, and further work is required to understand what makes a walking and cycling or a car environment in terms of multi?modal mobility networks. Furthermore, it was found that topological centrality measures show a hierarchy in the <b>multi?modal</b> <b>network</b> infrastructure, and that one should use different methods to analyse the different modes because they play different roles. Finally, it was found that, despite these differences, {{it is important to consider}} the network as an integrated multi?layered system. How these layers are modelled and articulated should be subject of further research. UrbanismArchitectur...|$|E
30|$|To {{determine}} {{transportation cost}} on the <b>multimodal</b> <b>network</b> (from supplier to potential DCs), the following process is applied. As a first step, the matrix {{part of the}} chromosome is decomposed into its rows and in each row the intermediate nodes used along the route are identified. In the second step, transportation mode between nodes is distinguished. In third step, distances between nodes are determined and multiplied by the corresponding transportation cost; sum of the results gives total cost for each link. Finally, total demand for each DC is calculated and multiplied by link costs. Sum of these costs form the <b>multimodal</b> <b>network</b> transportation cost. Last cost function {{is the cost of}} providing mode changing facilities at multimodal terminals. To have the cost calculated, nodes which mode changes are happened should be identified. For this mean, inbound and outbound modes are determined for each node along multimodal links. If the modes are identical, then node may host no mode change; otherwise mode changing facilities need to be established on that location. Fixed cost of providing mode changing facilities is aggregated to form the fourth cost function.|$|E
40|$|The {{applying}} of simplified schemes, such as cordon pricing, as second-best {{solution to}} the toll network design problem is investigated here {{in the context of}} multiclass traffic assignment on <b>multimodal</b> <b>networks.</b> To this end a suitable equilibrium model has been developed, together with an efficient algorithm capable of simulating large scale networks in quite reasonable computer time. This model implements the theoretical framework proposed in a previous work on the toll optimization problem, where the validity of marginal cost pricing for the context at hand is stated. Application of the model to the real case of Rome shows us, not only that on <b>multimodal</b> <b>networks</b> a relevant share (up to 20 %) of the maximum improvements in terms of social welfare achievable with marginal cost pricing can in fact be obtained through cordon pricing, but also that in practical terms rationing is a valid alternative to pricing, thus getting around some of the relevant questions (theoretical, technical, social) the latter raises. As a result we propose a practical method to analyze advanced pricing and rationing policies differentiated for user categories, which enables us to compare alternative operative solutions with an upper bound on social welfare based on a solid theoretical background.
