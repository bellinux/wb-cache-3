5|$|At the Twelve Oaks party, Scarlett privately {{declares}} {{her feelings}} to Ashley, but he rebuffs her by responding {{that he and}} Melanie are more compatible. Scarlett is incensed when she discovers another guest, Rhett Butler, has overheard their conversation. The barbecue is disrupted by the declaration {{of war and the}} men rush to enlist. As Scarlett watches Ashley kiss Melanie goodbye, Melanie's younger brother Charles proposes to her. Although she does not love him, Scarlett consents and they are <b>married</b> <b>before</b> he leaves to fight.|$|E
5|$|Bewick {{was born}} at Cherryburn, {{a house in the}} village of Mickley, Northumberland, near Newcastle upon Tyne on 10 or 11 August 1753, {{although}} his birthday was always celebrated on the 12th. His parents were tenant farmers: his father John had been <b>married</b> <b>before</b> his union with Jane, and was in his forties when Thomas, the eldest of eight, was born. John rented a small colliery at Mickley Bank, which employed perhaps six men. Bewick attended school in the nearby village of Ovingham.|$|E

5|$|Child {{marriage}} (including {{union or}} cohabitation) {{is defined as}} marriage {{under the age of}} eighteen and is an ancient custom. In 2010 it was estimated that 67 million women, then, in their twenties had been <b>married</b> <b>before</b> they turned eighteen, and that 150 million would be in the next decade, equivalent to 15 million per year. This number had increased to 70 million by 2012. In developing countries one third of girls are married under age, and 1:9 before 15. The practice is commonest in South Asia (48% of women), Africa (42%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (29%). The highest prevalence is in Western and Sub-Saharan Africa. The percentage of girls <b>married</b> <b>before</b> the age of eighteen is as high as 75% in countries such as Niger (Nour, Table I). Most child marriage involves girls. For instance in Mali the ratio of girls to boys is 72:1, while in countries such as the United States the ratio is 8:1. Marriage may occur as early as birth, with the girl being sent to her husbands home as early as age seven.|$|E
5|$|Eardwulf {{was evidently}} <b>married</b> <b>before</b> he became king, as Alcuin reproached him for abandoning {{his wife for}} a {{concubine}} soon after his coronation. This strained relations with the new Archbishop Eanbald II—Eanbald I {{had died in the}} year of Eardwulf's coronation. Alcuin, while condemning secular oppression of the church, affected surprise that while the Archbishop Eanbald was travelling he was accompanied by a large retinue, including soldiers, and that he received and protected the king's enemies. Eanbald was presumably in conflict with Eardwulf over property, but it is likely that he also supported rivals for Eardwulf's throne.|$|E

5|$|Unlike in Western Europe where priests {{were clearly}} demarcated from the laymen, the clergy of the Eastern Roman Empire {{remained}} {{in close contact}} with the rest of society. Readers and subdeacons were drawn from the laity and expected to be at least twenty years of age while priests and bishops had to be at least 30. Unlike the Latin church, the Byzantine church allowed married priests and deacons, {{as long as they were}} <b>married</b> <b>before</b> ordination. Bishops, however, were required to be unmarried.|$|E
5|$|The Mahabharata portrays Iravan as dying {{a heroic}} {{death in the}} 18-day Kurukshetra War (Mahabharata war), the epic's main subject. However, the South Indian cults have a {{supplementary}} tradition of honouring Aravan's self-sacrifice to the goddess Kali to ensure her favour and {{the victory of the}} Pandavas in the war. The Kuttantavar cult focuses on one of the three boons granted to Aravan by the god Krishna in honour of this self-sacrifice. Aravan requested that he be <b>married</b> <b>before</b> his death. Krishna satisfied this boon in his female form, Mohini. In Koovagam (கூவாகம்), Tamil Nadu, this incident is re-enacted in an 18-day festival, first by a ceremonial marriage of Aravan to ThiruNangais and male villagers (who have taken vows to Aravan) and then by their widowhood after ritual re-enactment of Aravan's sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|The final {{demobilisation}} plan assigned differing {{scales of}} points for service men and women. Service men were allocated two points {{for each year}} of age based on their age at enlistment and a further two points for each month of service {{if they did not}} have dependent children or three points if they did. Service women received three points for each year of age at enlistment and a point for each month of service. Women with children were given priority for demobilisation, followed by those who had <b>married</b> <b>before</b> the end of the war. Service women who married after the war could ask for an early discharge on compassionate grounds. Men were also eligible for early discharge on compassionate or health grounds, if they had skills which were important to the Australian economy or had been accepted into a full-time training course.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{difficulty}} with Bede's chronology {{on the date}} of Æthelburg's marriage, as surviving papal letters to Edwin urging him to convert imply that Eadbald only recently had become a Christian, which conflicts with Bede's chronology. The historian D. P. Kirby argues that Paulinus and Æthelburg must therefore have gone to Northumbria earlier than 624, and that Paulinus went north, not as a bishop, but as a priest, returning later to be consecrated. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting agrees with Kirby's reasoning. Another historian, Peter Hunter Blair, argues that Æthelburg and Edwin were <b>married</b> <b>before</b> 625, but {{that she did not}} go to Northumbria until 625. If Kirby's arguments are accepted, then the date of Paulinus' consecration needs to be changed by a year, to 21 July 626.|$|E
5|$|Although {{problems}} with sexual function {{that result from}} SCI {{play a part in}} some divorces, they are not as important as emotional maturity in determining the success of a marriage. People with SCI get divorced more often {{than the rest of the}} population, and marriages that took place before the injury fail more often than those that took place after (33% vs. 21%). People <b>married</b> <b>before</b> the injury report less happy marriages and worse sexual adjustment than those married after, possibly indicating that spouses had difficulty adjusting to the new circumstances. For those who chose to become involved with someone after an injury, the disability was an accepted part of the relationship from the outset. Understanding and acceptance of the limitations that result from the injury on the part of the uninjured partner is an important factor in a successful marriage. Many divorces have been found to be initiated by the injured partner, sometimes due to the depression and denial that often occurs early after the injury. Thus counseling is important, not just for managing changes in self-perception but in perceptions about relationships.|$|E
5|$|Jinnah's {{given name}} at birth was Mahomedali, and he was born most likely in 1876, to Jinnahbhai Poonja and his wife Mithibai, in a rented {{apartment}} {{on the second floor}} of Wazir Mansion near Karachi, Sindh, now in Pakistan but then within the Bombay Presidency of British India. Jinnah's family was from a Gujarati Ismaili background, though Jinnah later followed the Twelver Shi'a teachings. According to Akbar Ahmed however, Jinnah moved to the Sunni sect early in life. Jinnah was from a wealthy merchant background, his father was a merchant and was born to a family of textile weavers in the village of Paneli in the princely state of Gondal (Kathiawar, Gujarat); his mother was also of that village. They had moved to Karachi in 1875, having <b>married</b> <b>before</b> their departure. Karachi was then enjoying an economic boom: the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 meant it was 200 nautical miles closer to Europe for shipping than Bombay. Jinnah was the second child; he had three brothers and three sisters, including his younger sister Fatima Jinnah. The parents were native Gujarati speakers, and the children also came to speak Kutchi and English. Except for Fatima, little is known of his siblings, where they settled or if they met with their brother as he advanced in his legal and political careers.|$|E

50|$|According to UNICEF, Africa has {{the highest}} {{incidence}} rates of child marriage, with over 70% of girls marrying {{under the age of}} 18, in three nations.

Among Nigerian women between the ages of twenty and twenty-four, 76% reported <b>marrying</b> <b>before</b> the age of 18 and 28% reported <b>marrying</b> <b>before</b> the age of fifteen. This UNICEF report is based on data that is derived from a small sample survey between 1995 and 2004, and the current rate is unknown given lack of infrastructure and in some cases, regional violence.|$|R
5|$|Orr {{was born}} in the town of Parry Sound on the shores of Georgian Bay in Ontario, Canada.

Orr's father, Doug Orr, had once been a hockey {{prospect}} and was invited to join the Atlantic City Seagulls in 1942 but turned down the offer. Doug Orr instead joined the Royal Canadian Navy, serving during the Second World War. He returned after the war to Parry Sound and Arva Steele, whom he had <b>married</b> <b>before</b> he left for war, and to a job in the CIL dynamite factory. Doug and Arva had five children together: Patricia, Ronnie, Bobby, Penny and Doug Jr. Bobby was born on March 20, 1948 at St. Joseph's Hospital, where his grandmother Elsie Orr was a nurse. Bobby was a sick baby at birth and his survival was tenuous.|$|E
