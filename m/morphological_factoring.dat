The study is conducted for {{the case of an}} exposure to a front plane wave at the 2100 MHz frequency carrier. This study is based on the development of different regression models for estimating the WBSAR as a function of <b>morphological</b> <b>factors</b> morphology. For this manner, a database of twelve anatomical human models (phantoms) has been considered. Also, eighteen supplementary phantoms obtained using morphing technique were generated to build the requested relation. The paper presents three models based on external <b>morphological</b> <b>factors</b> like the Body Surface Area (BSA), the Body Mass Index (BMI) or the body mass. These models show good results for families obtained by morphing technique on the estimation of the WBSAR (< 10 %) but still less accurate (30 %) when applied for different original phantoms. This study stresses the importance of the internal <b>morphological</b> <b>factors</b> such as muscle and fat proportions in the characterization of the WBSAR. The regression models are then improved using internal <b>morphological</b> <b>factors</b> with an estimation error around 10 % on the WBSAR.

Factor analysis of 17 morphological measures produced three <b>morphological</b> factors: <b>factor</b> of mesoectoendomorphy (general <b>morphological</b> <b>factor)</b> and factor of pronounced endomorphy, i. e. excessive adipose tissue, along with low skeleton longitudinality. Factor analysis of 16 motor variables yielded four motor factors: factor of general motoricity; factor integrating leg flexibility and arm explosiveness; factor juxtaposing body flexibility and repetitive leg strength; and factor predominantly defining leg movement frequency. Three significant canonical correlations, i. e. linear combinations, explained the association between the set of six latent variables of the morphological and basic motor system, and five variables assessing the knowledge in competitive gymnastics. The first canonical linear combination was based on the favorable and predominant impact of the general motor factor (a system integrating leg explosiveness, whole body coordination, relative arm and trunk strength, and arm movement frequency), along with unfavorable effect of <b>morphological</b> <b>factors</b> on the gymnastics elements performance, squat vault and handstand in particular. The relation of the second pair of canonical factors pointed to the effects of leg flexibility and arm explosiveness on the cartwheel and backward pullover mount performance, whereas the relation of the third pair of canonical factors showed a favorable impact of the general <b>morphological</b> <b>factor</b> and leg movement frequency regulator on the forward shoulderkip from increase, cartwheel and handstand performance...|$|R

With this purpose, a set of 18 morphological measures and a set of 12 motor tests were used on a sample of 60 male and 51 female Croatian karateka aged 13 to 15. Different morphological structures were isolated by factor analysis according to gender. Two <b>morphological</b> <b>factors</b> in male karateka, named: ecto-mesomorphy and fat tissue. Three factors in female karateka, named: endo-mesomorphic somatotype, ecto-mesomorphic somatotype and transverse dimensionality of the skeleton, particularly of the hand and wrist. Also, different motor structures were isolated by factor analysis according to gender. In male karateka: the first factor responsible for cortical regulation of movement, the second one responsible for power-force regulation and the third one named precision. In female karateka: the first factor integrating regulators of speed, force, movement structures and muscle tone with synergetic regulation, the second one responsible for energy regulation integrating core strength and sprint, and the third one named precision. Latent structure of fighting efficiency in karate differs according to gender. Two <b>morphological</b> <b>factors,</b> namely force regulator and factor of cortical regulation of movement, and one <b>morphological</b> <b>factor</b> defined as ecto-mesomorphy factor have a significant impact on determining success in male karateka. In determining fighting efficiency of young female karateka, two motor factors have significant impact, namely: the first factor integrating regulators of speed, force and agility/coordination, accompanied by regulator of muscle tone and synergetic regulation, and the second factor of basic core strength which ensures the initial energy component in technique performance, particularly of kicks.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} biomotor structures in elite female handball players, <b>factor</b> structures of <b>morphological</b> characteristics and basic motor abilities, and of variables evaluating situation motor abilities of elite female handball players (n= 53) were determined first, followed by determination of differences and relations of the morphological, motor and specific motor space according to handball performance. Factor analysis of 16 morphological measures produced three <b>morphological</b> <b>factors,</b> i. e. factor of absolute voluminosity, i. e. mesoendomorphy, factor of longitudinal skeleton dimensionality, and factor of transverse hand dimensionality. Factor analysis of 15 motor variables yielded five basic motor dimensions, i. e. factor of agility, factor of throwing explosive strength, factor of running explosive strength (sprint), factor of jumping explosive strength and factor of movement frequency rate. Factor analysis of 5 situation motor variables produced two dimensions: factor of specific agility with explosiveness and factor of specific precision with ball manipulation. Analysis of variance yielded greatest differences relative to handball performance in the factor of specific agility and throwing strength, and the factor of basic motoricity that integrates the ability of coordination (agility) with upper extremity throwing explosiveness and lower extremity sprint (30 -m sprint) and jumping (standing triple jump). Considering <b>morphological</b> <b>factors,</b> the factor of voluminosity, i. e. mesoendomorphy, which is defined by muscle mass rather than adipose tissue, was found to contribute significantly to the players’ performance.

It was hypothesized that flowering structures would be more reliant on insect-derived nitrogen than the pitchers themselves, and so expected to see an increase in prey-derived nitrogen in flowers. Significantly higher levels of insect-derived nitrogen were found in flowering structures compared to pitchers, with a mean in flowers of 73 % prey-derived nitrogen. Pitcher size, color, soil temperature, surrounding biomass, number of flowers, and captured insect biomass all correlated with variation in prey-derived nitrogen values in the flowers.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the contributions of functional and <b>morphological</b> <b>factors</b> in the recovery of the quadriceps muscle after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. METHODS: Nine subjects (31. 3 ± 5. 8 years) underwent eccentric exercise sessions twice a week for 12 weeks. Quadriceps muscle function was evaluated using an isokinetic dynamometer (isometric and eccentric peak torque) and electromyography (RMS). Morphological changes were measured using magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: The initial evaluation showed a significant deficit in knee extensor torque in the involved limb and significant muscle atrophy along the length of the quadriceps. EMG activity was lower in all tested situations. Eccentric training significantly increased isokinetic torque (from 199 ± 51 to 240 ± 63, p< 0. 05, respectively) and quadriceps area, with the greatest hypertrophy in the proximal thigh region (from 169 ± 27 to 189 ± 25. 8 cm², p< 0. 01). The EMG activity of vastus medialis increased after the first six weeks of eccentric training. The increased extensor torque was correlated with quadriceps cross-sectional area (r= 0. 81, p< 0. 01) and EMG activity (r= 0. 69, p< 0. 05). After twelve weeks of training, there was a correlation only between torque and cross-sectional area (r= 0. 78, p< 0. 01).
