The district council collects council tax, provides services such as building regulations and local planning, leisure and tourism, handles issues strategic to the district, and many other services. ECDC is in turn governed by Cambridgeshire County Council which has administration buildings in Cambridge.

40|$|In the {{beginning}} of 2000, an inquiry was carried out among the readers in all <b>mobile</b> <b>libraries</b> in Slovenia. Fourteen questions were asked {{in order to find}} out what the readers thought of our work and how important were <b>mobile</b> <b>libraries</b> to them. The inquiry was planned as part of the main topic of the 10 th meeting of Slovene mobile libraries,i. e. the Survey of the Effectiveness of <b>Mobile</b> <b>Libraries</b> in Slovenia. The inquiry included more than 13 % of the active readers all over Slovenia. Percentages of the respondents,in regard to gender and status, reflect the structure of the readers. Respondents’answers were very similar in all <b>mobile</b> <b>libraries.</b> The results showed that the readers were satisfied with the service, the attitude and the qualification of the employees and they were pleased with the selection and presentation of materials. In future, they would like to have access to more audio and video materials. The two main reasons for attending <b>mobile</b> <b>libraries</b> are: remoteness of stationary libraries and the selection of the materials. For them, <b>mobile</b> <b>libraries</b> are often the only means available for borrowing books. The most important result of the inquiry was in the fact that the materials and the services offered by <b>mobile</b> <b>libraries</b> were used by more people (130 % more) than the recorded number of active members...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we discuss the {{phenomenon}} of <b>mobile</b> <b>libraries</b> with special reference to the Greek context. First we {{provide an overview of}} the history of <b>mobile</b> <b>libraries</b> internationally. Then we proceed to our case study presenting new data on the profile of the majority of mobile libraries’ users and on the operation mode of such a particular case of libraries in Greece. By way of conclusion we reflect on their current state providing an explanation for the reasons which have led to the decline of this institution in recent years. Lastly, we discuss the social mission of <b>mobile</b> <b>libraries</b> (which operate largely also as school libraries), attempting a correlation between the function of the welfare state and its obligations to citizens as an issue directly implicated to the future and present of <b>mobile</b> <b>libraries...</b>|$|R
5|$|The village holds typical English rural festivals {{during the}} year. The spring and harvest festivals are horticultural shows {{that include the}} {{surrounding}} villages. The country fair (or fête) in the summer previously included traditional country games, stalls and attractions such as hay bale throwing, tug of war and a coconut shy, although the village has not held a fête since 2009.

This thesis aims to identify the professional identities found in these <b>mobile</b> <b>libraries.</b> The way to reach this goal will be through a systematic analysis of public documents and interviews with two decision makers employed at <b>mobile</b> <b>libraries.</b> The collected documents and interview transcriptions {{have been subjected to}} a directed qualitative content analysis based on the professional identities defined by Anders Ørom and Trine Schreiber. The additional goal is to uncover which, if any, unique identities exist in Sami <b>mobile</b> <b>libraries.</b> A main finding in this thesis was that of a new professional identity; the culture and language curator. This identity is connected to tasks concerning the preservation, revitalisation and highlighting of the Sami language and culture. This identity is also applicable for librarians working with other indigenous or minority languages around the world...|$|R

Design/ Methodology/ Approach The research is exploratory in nature. This paper is based on a review of literature, survey information, and on the author&#x 2019;s own viewpoints. A comprehensive search of scientific literature has been done along with a survey for validating the necessity of designing <b>mobile</b> based <b>library</b> information and service delivery systems. Responses to closed-ended questions in particular on 7 -point Likert scales were analyzed using the descriptive analysis techniques of SPSS 20. 0 and responses to other closed-ended questions were analyzed using general statistics. Findings The research indicates that users of academic libraries, especially students and faculty members, have a positive notion regarding designing and implementing a <b>mobile</b> based <b>library</b> information and service delivery system. It also reveals user opinions regarding the possible problems associated with the design and implementation of a <b>mobile</b> based <b>library</b> information and service delivery system.
