40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{approximation}} for individual overflow moments of a multiservice link with differing arrival rates, capacity requirements and <b>mean</b> <b>holding</b> <b>times,</b> where trunk reservation is used.

In the absence of controls, larger bandwidth calls can experience a much higher blocking probability than low bandwidth calls [23], [20].

40|$|Background: Although preterm infants possess early tactile manual abilities, the {{influence}} of the postnatal experience has not yet been systematically examined. Aims: To investigate whether early tactile manual habituation, discrimination and recognition (following interference) of shape in preterm infants are modified by postnatal age. Study design: Prospective study. Subjects: Forty preterm infants were assessed from the post-conceptional age (PCA) of 34 weeks. Two groups were made up according to postnatal age (PNA) : low PNA (PNA ≤ 10 days of life) and high PNA (PNA ≥ 12 days of life). Outcome measures: An object (prism or cylinder) was presented repeatedly in the left hand, and holding times of the object were recorded during each trial. Results: Holding time was shorter for all preterm infants following successive presentation of the same object irrespective of postnatal age range. In the discrimination phase, the <b>mean</b> <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> for the novel object was longer than holding times in the last two habituation trials, in both PNA groups. Finally, the <b>mean</b> <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> of the familiar object presented in the recognition phase was shorter than the holding time of the novel object presented previously, but only in the low PNA group. Conclusions: Tactile manual habituation and discrimination of shape information is present in preterm infants at a post-conceptional age of 34 weeks, independently of postnatal age. However, tactile manual recognition of familiar shapes following interference is affected by length of postnatal experience. The significance of this last result is discussed in detail...|$|E

The long-lived calls can be reserved well in advance, and the short-lived calls are provided on demand. Therefore, {{we assume that the}} long-lived calls have strict priority over the short-lived ones. We develop approximations for the estimation of the blocking probability based on the quasi-stationary approach in two ways. One uses the Erlang fixed-point approximation (EFPA), and the other uses the overflow priority classification approximation (OPCA). We compare the results of the approximations with simulation results and discuss the accuracy of the approximations under different system parameters, such as ratio of offered load, number of links per trunk, maximum allowable number of deflections, and trunk reservation.

The three experimental parameters were selected as common priorities by the proposed collaborators based on an in-kind project through which a description of the current state-of-the-art for this technical area was developed.

We consider a model in which devices operate in a regular mode until they are triggered into an alarm mode by an alarm event. The positions of devices and events are modeled by means of Poisson point processes, where the generated traffic by a given device depends on its position and event positions. We first consider the case where devices and events are static and devices generate traffic according to a Bernoulli process, where we derive the total rate from the devices at the base station. We then extend the model by defining a two-state Markov chain for each device, which allows for devices to stay in alarm mode for a geometrically distributed holding time. The temporal characteristics of this model are analyzed via the autocovariance function, where the effect of event density and <b>mean</b> <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> are shown.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that the Hortonian mechanism of runoff generation occurs in arid and semi-arid regions, generally characterized by high rainfall intensity on soils exhibiting low infiltrabilities. Differently, in steeply sloping forested watersheds in humid climates, by infiltrating through a highly permeable upper soil horizon, water moves beneath the soil surface determining a slow response. However, in most real cases, for example when in arid regions mountain forested areas take place, both (quick and slow) runoff generation processes coexist and together contribute to the hydrologic hillslope response. In this paper, based on analytical solutions of the hydrologic response, instantaneous response functions of both quick and slow components are defined, depending on parameters characterizing geometrical and dynamical features at the hillslope scale of immediate physical meaning. For each response component, two characteristic time-scales are defined, the <b>mean</b> <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> spent by a particle in its motion through the hillslope and the so-called time to equilibrium, accounting for a critical rainfall duration generating a maximum discharge {{at the bottom of}} the hillslope. Approximated instantaneous response function (IRFs) in the usual form of gamma probability density functions (pdfs) are proposed, which allowed reducing the many parameters appearing in both quick and slow response models to the scale and shape parameters, also incorporating the effect of different antecedent flow conditions. At the basin scale, the collective response of all the hillslopes is described by a representative hillslope, which combined response accounts for the relative dominance of quick and slow response...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{past year}} has seen {{explosive}} growth in internet traffic. Currently, the most common way of accessing the internet is via the switching systems and the interoffice trunk facilities of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The PSTN was designed to carry voice calls that have an average call holding time of about 3 minutes. The nominal 3 minute call assumption pervades all aspects of telco equipment design such as switch engineering, line concentration ratios, and trunk group sizes. However, internet calls violate this fundamental assumption and have a <b>mean</b> <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> {{of the order of}} 20 minutes with some calls lasting for many hours. This long holding time traffic severely taxes the PSTN. It requires additional equipment to be provisioned, without compensating revenues, and potentially affects service performance for all users. Internet traffic, which is packet data in nature, can in principle be carried much more efficiently on data networks. However, since the PSTN currently represents the only nearuniversal access method, any long term solution necessarily involves a staged migration from the present mode of operation towards some packet network solution. This paper reviews the impacts of internet traffic on the PSTN. It summarizes the impact of internet traffic on transmission and switching equipment, the need for comprehensive revisions to existing engineering and planning algorithms, and the implications of these issues for operational practices and operations support systems. It also provides analysis of the cost of supporting internet traffic on the PSTN. Finally, it describes a number of possible solutions. In each case the current barriers to implementing the solution are discussed. I...|$|E

40|$|On the {{suitability}} of applications for GMPLS networks Abstract — After identifying that current GMPLS specifications only allow {{for the implementation of}} a call blocking mode of operation that handles immediate-request calls (not book-ahead calls), this paper addresses the question of {{suitability of}} different types of applications for such networks. Two types of applications are considered, ones in which the per-circuit bandwidth and <b>mean</b> call <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> are independent and ones in which they are dependent (file transfers). GMPLS networks are often cited for high-bandwidth applications and for large file transfers. This work, through analysis, reasons that GMPLS networks are not well suited both for applications in which the required per-circuit bandwidth is high, on the order of one-tenth the shared link capacity, or low, on the order of one-thousandth the shared link capacity. Ideal is the one-hundredth range. Further for file transfers, we show that the best range of operation to achieve high utilization and low call blocking rates with an acceptable number of ports on switches for traffic aggregation, requires call <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> to be small, in the range of seconds.

High concentrations of feces from cows with clinical symptoms of Johne's disease were used to contaminate raw milk in order to realistically mimic possible incidents most closely. Final M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis concentrations varying from 102 to 3. 5 × 105 cells per ml raw milk were used. Heat treatments including industrial HTST were simulated on a pilot scale with 22 different time-temperature combinations, including 60 to 90 °C at <b>holding</b> (<b>mean</b> residence) <b>times</b> of 6 to 15 s.

30|$|In this paper, the call-level {{performance}} analysis of mobile CRCNs under fixed-rate with hard-delay constraints (FR-HDC) traffic 1 is investigated. This issue is {{addressed in the}} following manner: (a) as a first step, a novel mathematical model to approximately capture the effect of interruption of SU calls due {{to the arrival of}} primary sessions is proposed. In particular, it is proposed to use an independent potential time (referred hereafter as unencumbered call interruption time) associated with the instant of possible interruption for each call in every visited cell. (b) Then, the SUs’ call interruption process due the arrival of primary users is approximated by a Poisson process. 2 (c) Building on this model and under the assumption that both CDT and UST have general probability distribution functions, analytical formulae for the probability distribution functions and the first three standardized moments of new call channel <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> (CHTn) and handoff call channel <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> (CHTh) as well as mathematical expressions for inter-cell and intra-cell handoff arrival rates are derived. Additionally, for exponentially distributed UST and generally distributed CDT, a novel closed-form mathematical expression for call forced termination probability of SUs (due to either inter-cell or intra-cell handoff failures) is derived. (d) On the other hand, considering all the involved time variables (i.e., unencumbered call interruption time, unencumbered service time, inter-arrival time, and cell dwell time) exponentially distributed and using fractional channel reservation to prioritize intra (due to spectrum handoff)- and inter (due to users’ mobility)-cell handoff call attempts over new call requests, a queuing analysis to evaluate the call-level performance of CRCNs with FR-HDC traffic in terms of Erlang capacity is developed. (Erlang capacity is obtained by optimizing the number of reserved channels.) (e) Finally, channel <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> statistics and the effects of the relative value of the mean secondary service time to the <b>mean</b> primary channel <b>holding</b> <b>time,</b> users’ mobility, the use of spectrum handoff (SH), and the primary channel utilization factor on the maximum Erlang capacity of the system are investigated.|$|R
40|$|The {{first two}} years of a {{two-phase}} program aimed at improving the high temperature crack initiation life prediction technology for gas turbine hot section components are discussed. In Phase 1 (baseline) effort, low cycle fatigue (LCF) models, using a data base generated for a cast nickel base gas turbine hot section alloy (B 1900 +Hf), were evaluated for their ability to predict the crack initiation life for relevant creep-fatigue loading conditions and to define data required for determination of model constants. The variables included strain range and rate, <b>mean</b> strain, strain <b>hold</b> <b>times</b> and temperature. None of the models predicted all of the life trends within reasonable data requirements. A Cycle Damage Accumulation (CDA) was therefore developed which follows an exhaustion of material ductility approach. Material ductility is estimated based on observed similarities of deformation structure between fatigue, tensile and creep tests. The cycle damage function is based on total strain range, maximum stress and stress amplitude and includes both time independent and time dependent components. The CDA model accurately predicts all of the trends in creep-fatigue life with loading conditions. In addition, all of the CDA model constants are determinable from rapid cycle, fully reversed fatigue tests and monotonic tensile and/or creep data...|$|R

Microstructure, dislocations and texture distribution were analysed by OM, TEM and EBSD techniques. Evolution of microstructure and texture in primary recrystallization was studied. Results indicate that as the annealing <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> prolongs, recovery and recrystallization occur gradually. When the <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> increases to 300 s, recrystallization is almost fully realized and grains are equiaxed.

Primary recrystallization texture is affected by <b>holding</b> <b>time.</b> As the <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> extends, { 111 } texture and { 110 } texture are weakened and Goss texture is strengthened. { 111 } texture is reduced firstly and then increases. The intensity of cube texture and rotated cube texture is stable.
