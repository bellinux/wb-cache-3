3000|$|As a {{critical}} component of the railway vehicle, underframe equipment has a great influence on the ride comfort of railway vehicles due to their big mass and active vibration. Therefore, study on the relationship between suspension parameters of underframe equipment and the modal frequency of carbody is extremely crucial for controlling the ride quality of railway vehicles. In this paper, a finite element model of the carbody was developed to investigate the effects of the suspension location, the mass of the <b>suspension</b> <b>equipment,</b> and the <b>suspension</b> frequency on the mode of the carbody. Then, the matching relationship between the suspension parameters and the modal frequency of the carbody was studied through the transfer function. In addition, roller rig tests were performed to verify the numerical simulation model of the carbody. The results show that the suspension parameters of the underframe equipment have a great influence on the mode of the carbody, especially for the frequency of the first bending mode. To improve the frequency of carbody high-frequency bending and reduce energy transfer, equipment with a large mass should be suspended toward the middle of the carbody. The weight of the equipment strongly affects the first bending frequency and energy transfer of the carbody. The frequency of heavy suspended equipment should be sufficiently low to increase the transmissibility of high frequencies and improve the vibration characteristics of the carbody. Although the bending frequency of the carbody can be improved effectively by increasing the suspension stiffness of the <b>suspension</b> <b>equipment,</b> in order to reduce carbody vibration effectively, the suspension frequency of the equipment should be slightly lower than the carbody bending frequency.|$|R

40|$|Abstract] The aircraft-store {{certification}} {{community and}} other tri-service test organizations {{have identified a}} need for a small, inexpensive instrumentation/telemetry system that can be installed non-intrusively in a variety of configurations and locations on aircraft surfaces, <b>suspension</b> <b>equipment,</b> weapon bay structure, and other test articles such as stores and ground vehicles without significantly impacting the performance of the system being tested. In addition, the instrumentation system must be able to be uninstalled quickly and easily, facilitating a return of the test article to its original un-instrumented state in a timely manner. A variety of sensors is desired, each capable of measuring a physical parameter of interest.

30|$|To {{optimize}} vibrational {{comfort in}} the design stage, {{the dynamics of the}} whole vehicle {{must be taken into account}} [9, 10]. The natural frequency of rolling stock is not only an important parameter in the dynamic loading of a carbody, but also forms the basis of the vehicle system dynamics. Elastic vibration in the carbody will be excited when the external excitation frequency equals the natural mode of the structure. The relationship between the suspension parameters of the equipment and the inherent carbody modal frequency have attracted widespread attention, as they are essential in ensuring system stability and passengers’ ride comfort. Carbody modeling is now the starting point of such research. By considering the carbody accessory structure, some progress has already been achieved. For instance, the influence of three types of equipment suspended from the carbody and the avoidance of structural resonance by adjusting the stiffness distribution has been reported [11]. Kang and Zeng [12] proposed a rigid coupling of the nonlinear system dynamics model. They discussed the vibration character of <b>suspension</b> <b>equipment</b> and studied the matching relation between the carbody modal frequency and suspension parameters, determining the optimal suspension location from the dynamic response of the underframe equipment. Taking CRH 3 electric multiple units (EMU) as an example, Zhao et al. [13] analyzed the influence of underframe equipment on the carbody mode, and suggested that the elastic <b>suspension</b> of <b>equipment</b> could effectively improve the bending and rhombic modes. The modeling of a carbody structure and its suspension units was elaborately described in [14], which presented a reasonable modeling method by changing the mass distribution and boundary conditions. The carbody, wheelset, and frame have been considered as elastomers to analyze the modal frequency of a 270  km/h high-speed EMU [15], and to compare the stiffness matching conditions of the whole vehicle. The modal frequency of passenger cars has been analyzed using a finite element method, with the effect of the mass and stiffness of additional parts also considered [16]. A linear prediction method has been applied to the modal properties of the carbody, and this approach was validated by data from both stationary and running tests [17]. However, most research only considers a modal analysis of the initial frequency. The relation between the modal frequency and vibration has not been studied. High-speed EMUs in China often use both elastic and rigid suspension. Research has shown that elastic suspension effectively reduces the elastic vibration, changing the modal frequency of the carbody. The equipment is equivalent to a dynamic vibration absorber when elastic suspension is used. The two peak values will appear in the curve of the first bending frequency of the carbody. The key problem in this paper is to determine the best combination of carbody mode suspension parameters and vibration. A series of simulations enables us to identify the matching principles between the <b>equipment</b> <b>suspension</b> parameters and the modal frequency of the carbody.|$|R

30|$|The dynamic {{vibration}} absorber (DVA) theory {{has been used to}} study the influence of elastic <b>suspension</b> of <b>equipment</b> on the carbody vibration, which indicates that an appropriate suspension stiffness and damping ratio could relive the first-order bending mode and reduce the flexible vibration of carbody [10, 11, 12, 13, 14].

Jacquot [16, 17] also used absorbers to reduce the vibration of plates, and he studied the damper location optimization for randomly forced cantilever beams. In [18, 19], {{in order to reduce the}} broad-band wave propagation and vibration within a certain frequency band, the absorbers were designed with various stiffness and damping coefficients in different types. However, the absorbers were regarded in a single-stage vibration isolation system, and the excitation from the absorber itself was not considered, such as the dynamic unbalance and impact turbulence.|$|R
30|$|From Fig.  14 b, one can {{see that}} the <b>equipment</b> <b>suspension</b> {{frequency}} increases with the stiffness; it is 12  Hz when the vertical stiffness is 150  kN/m, which is close to the first-order bending mode. Thus, the suspension force and vibration acceleration of carbody, frame, and equipment increase sharply. Also, it is 8  Hz when the vertical stiffness is 60  kN/m; thus, the suspension frequency is smaller than the first-order bending mode of carbody, and a satisfactory vibration isolation performance is obtained. However, a smaller stiffness means a greater static deflection, larger movements, and shorter life cycle of rubber elements. In addition, a greater stiffness is preferred to avoid the resonance.|$|R
