[...] The airfield was north of Salt Lake, in an area known variously over the years as Huskerville, Arnold Heights and Air Park; and was located approximately within the western half of the West Lincoln Township. [...] The air field was a stop for United Airlines in 1927 and a <b>mail</b> <b>stop</b> in 1928. [...] As train, automobile, and air travel increased, business flourished, and the city prospered. [...] The population of Lincoln increased 38.2% from 1920 to a population of 75,933 in 1930. [...] In 1942 the Lincoln Army Airfield was established at the site. During World War II, over 25,000 aviation mechanics were trained with over 40,000 troopers being processed for combat. [...] The Army closed the base in 1945. [...] The Air Force reactivated the base during the Korean War in 1952. [...] In 1966, the base was closed and Lincoln annexed the airfield, including the base's old housing units to the west. [...] The base became the Lincoln Municipal Airport under ownership of the Lincoln Airport Authority. [...] The airport was later renamed the Lincoln Airport. [...] The two main airlines serving the airport were United Airlines and Frontier Airlines. [...] The authority shared facilities with the Nebraska National Guard, who continued ownership over some portions of the old Air Force base. [...] In 1966, Lincoln annexed the township of West Lincoln, incorporated in 1887. [...] West Lincoln voters rejected annexation by Lincoln until the state legislature passed a bill in 1965 allowing cities to annex surrounding areas without a vote.|$|E

50|$|Sentinel {{was built}} in 1898 for the Hunt Brothers, who ran a family {{steamboat}} business on Puget Sound. The Hunts ran the vessel to stops on Bay Island in southern Puget Sound, and also on a run to Seattle with <b>mail</b> <b>stops</b> on Vashon Island. The vessel was sold to Hansen Transportation Co. in 1903, rebuilt and widened so as to increase passenger capacity from 100 to 250. In 1921 Hansen Transportation sold the vessel to Ed Lorentz.

5000|$|... "The {{damage done}} to the farms in the river bottoms was immense. Some were {{stripped}} utterly of their fences; fields under cultivation were washed into ruts by {{the violence of the}} water; all hope of a crop for one season being destroyed, not only by what was carried away, but by the debris which was left by the subsiding of the river. It was almost impossible to estimate the losses. Roads were rendered impassable-bridges swept away-the <b>mails</b> <b>stopped,</b> and traveling by land to any distance utterly vetoed. Houses were carried away, mills damaged, timber floated off, and all manner of mischief done by the flood." [...] J.M. Dixon blamed the flood for a temporary decrease in the population of the town.|$|R
50|$|The ill Charbonneau {{was taken}} to Inskip Station in Danner, Oregon, built in 1865, about 33 mi from the river and west of Jordan Valley. It is now a ghost town.

It had its own well, and Charbonneau may have deteriorated from drinking the water.

Under Cox' management, the structure served as a trading post, an unofficial Butterfield Overland <b>Mail</b> <b>stop,</b> post office, voting place, eating establishment, church of the Benton County Baptist Society, and inn. As the war moved near, Jesse Cox left the tavern to the care of his son and daughter-in-law Joseph and Lucinda Pratt Cox and went to Kansas.|$|E
50|$|Gladewater {{was founded}} by the Texas and Pacific Railway Company in 1873 on land bought from Jarrett Dean and Anderson White. A {{community}} called St. Clair, 2 mi to the east, moved to Gladewater when the railroad announced that the only <b>mail</b> <b>stop</b> in the area would be there; residents from Point Pleasant, also bypassed by the railroad, moved to Gladewater. The first post office at Gladewater was established on August 22, 1873. The town's name probably originated from its proximity to Glade Creek, {{a tributary of the}} Sabine River that rose in a rather barren region called the Glades.|$|E

A new version of the series was produced by Cosgrove Hall Films from 2003, which expanded on many aspects of the original series. In 2000, Royal <b>Mail</b> <b>stopped</b> using Postman Pat for their promotional and charity work.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{feasibility}} of using the detection of electron antineutrinos produced in fission to monitor the time dependence of the Plutonium content of nuclear power reactors and large (> 1 MWatt) research reactors. If practical such a scheme would allow worldwide, automated monitoring of reactors and, thereby, the detection of proliferation attempts. Although this idea shows some promise, we find that a practical scheme is difficult to envision. We also consider using fission antineutrino spectra to determine and attribute the fuel in an unexploded nuclear device. We find {{it would not be}} possible to determine the isotopic content of such a device in this manner. Finally, we examine the possibility of antineutrino detection of an unannounced low-yield (∼ 1 kton) nuclear explosion. We argue this can be ruled out completely. 1 <b>Mail</b> <b>stops</b> and email addresses...|$|R

50|$|Thanks to the {{creation}} of a railroad system that was essential to travel and supply in Virginia, many small towns including Catlett sprung up as stops.

The land that the town was built on had originally been granted to John Catlett in 1715, but was not named for him at first.
