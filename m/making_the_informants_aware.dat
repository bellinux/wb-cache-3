Method: The study has a qualitative exploratory design. Data was created by multistage focus group interviews and analyzed inspired by Lundman and Granheim’s content analysis. The focus groups consisted of midwives and public health nurses. Results: <b>The</b> <b>informants</b> were <b>aware</b> that obesity in pregnancy may cause complications for both mother and child, but they experienced obesity and lifestyle changes as challenging in antenatal care. Weight and body were perceived as something vulnerable. Informants found it hard to talk about weight because they were afraid of reactions from the pregnant women.

40|$|Abstract The overall {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} to what extent new research findings, in neuroscience and learning, {{may be useful in}} a school improvement context. In a qualitative interview study combined with questionnaire, we have investigated the approach to school improvement that exists in a municipality. Informants have been head teachers in preschool and primary school, special education teachers in a student health team and a development manager. The outcome of the study showed that all of the study participants, all of which have a formal mandated to work for school improvement occurs. It also shows that informants, according to their professional position, express different goals when relating to school improvement. The study also shows that all <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> are <b>aware</b> of and considered that the new research findings, in neuroscience and learning, was particularly important for school personnel to know about as well in preschool as in primary school, to meet all children’s and pupils’ different needs. Furthermore <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> believed that <b>the</b> neuroscientific perspective can help create better conditions for the activities to reach the policy documents aim. One conclusion to be drawn from the study in this is that in the studied municipality of the staff groups (school leaders, special educators, development manager) which has formal responsibility for school improvement, there is great interest both to acquire knowledge from research ant to disseminate and apply research- based knowledge. The study also, shows that <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> believe that research-based knowledge of neurodidactics is particularly important and will become increasingly important for school improvement.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 54) This {{study is}} {{an analysis of}} some of the phonological, grammatical, and lexical features of the English spoken by native Urdu speakers living in the United States. The initial data collection involved noting down all nonstandard English usages by native Urdu speakers in informal social situations. Based on this data, written exercises, perception tests, pronunciation lists, a reading passage, and a common topic for informal discussion were developed for the second data collection. Both error analysis and contrastive analysis were then performed on this data collected from a number of <b>informants.</b> Phonologically, <b>the</b> most significant occurrences of errors include the use of the Urdu labiodental /w/ in place of the English consonants /v/ and /w/ and in the use of / th/ for / 9 /, a sound non- existant in Urdu. Prepositions or postpositions occur in both languages. Due to their idiosyncratic features in different languages, the second language learner is faced with the task of memorizing them. In the written tests, only a few Urdu natives revealed {{that they did not know}} the SAE usage. Because Urdu does not use the verb do as a support verb, the Urdu native often omits it in his English speech. According to the written test data, <b>the</b> Urdu <b>informants</b> are <b>aware</b> of SAE usage of do as a main verb as well as a support verb. <b>The</b> Urdu <b>informants</b> often deviate in their use of the English definite article. This is shown to be caused by the fact that such an article does not exist in Urdu. They also have difficulty in using the noun partitive, pair of, again because such a partitive does not occur in Urdu. Count-noncount nouns present <b>the</b> Urdu <b>informant</b> with problems of SAE usage since the classification of these nouns is peculiar to each language. Even though <b>the</b> Urdu <b>informants</b> are <b>aware</b> that an English demonstrative cannot be used in conjunction with a possessive, as the data shows, they occasionally use such a construction in their English speech. The study concludes with the statement that since the Urdu speakers have mastered English global grammar, they are successful communicators in their second language...|$|R

One of my conclusions is that bilingual children learn the language during both free play and structured play especially when educators are present and aware of the activities that they perform. It is also important to see children as individuals to cover all the needs of children at different activities. Finally, I can also mention that bilingual children develop their language in the play by using different materials and communicate in different ways to contact other children. In play, children work a lot with their fantasies, knowledge and experience they already have from before and that they created during the game...|$|R

40|$|Bakgrund: Våldet mot kvinnor är ett folkhälsoproblem. Det är svårt att fastställa den faktiska prevalensen vad gäller våldsutsatta kvinnor delvis på grund av att mörkertalet är stort. Syfte: Syftet med studien var att undersöka samverkan i organisationer och myndigheter i arbetet med våldsutsatta kvinnor i nära relationer i Skaraborgsregionen. Metod: Tre semistrukturerade intervjuer genomfördes med myndighetspersoner från X, Y och Z, vilka arbetar med våldsutsatta kvinnor i nära relationer. Resultat: Resultatet visade att femton kommuner i Skaraborgsregionen samverkar i arbetet med våldsutsatta kvinnor. Enligt informanterna var en av effekterna av samverkan möjligheten att hänvisa kvinnorna vidare. Informanterna såg {{potential}} till förbättringar i det framtida samarbetet, exempelvis med förskola och skola. Resultatet visade även att informanterna är medvetna om betydelsen av sitt bemötande mot våldsutsatta kvinnor, vissa mer än andra. Slutsats: En kommun kan inte ensam ge en kvinna tillräcklig hjälp, varför samverkan är viktig för de femton kommuner som deltar. Samverkan i Skaraborgsregionen fungerar bra, dock finns det delar som kan förbättras. Informanterna hade olika egna förslag till förbättring, exempelvis en utökad myndighetssamverkan.  Background: The {{violence against}} women is a public health problem. It {{is difficult to determine}} the actual prevalence of the {{violence against women}} because unreported cases are high. Aim: The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the interaction in organizations and agencies with abused women in intimate relationships in the region of Skaraborg. Method: Three semistructured interviews were conducted with officials from X, Y and Z, who work with abused women in intimate relationships. Results: The results showed that there are fifteen councils in the region of Skaraborg who interact with abused women. One of the effects of the interaction is to be able to refer further according to <b>the</b> <b>informants.</b> <b>The</b> <b>informants</b> saw potential for improvement in the future, for example by collaborating with preschool and school. The results also showed that <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> are <b>aware</b> of <b>the</b> importance of their treatment against abused women, some more than others. Conclusion: The interaction is important to the fifteen councils in the region of Skaraborg, because one council can not alone give the women adequate help. The interaction in the region of Skaraborg works fine, however there are things that can improve in order to get better. <b>The</b> <b>informants</b> had their own different suggestions on how to make changes to the better, an example is a wider interaction with other agencies...|$|R
30|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> were <b>aware</b> that CBCCs were {{established}} {{in order to provide}} pre-primary school learning to children. Their view was that pre-primary school learning offered by CBCCs provides a strong educational foundation for children. They explained that CBCCs provide children with both learning and association skills; enable children to easily adapt to primary school environment; and, that such children perform very well in primary school compared to those who have not been enrolled in pre-schools. In some communities orphan care centres {{were established}} to provide basic necessities such as food, clothes, blankets and education to orphans and other vulnerable. Most informants added that some of the orphan care centres have, however, been transformed into CBCCs because of the demand for pre-school education among non-orphaned children and also as an attempt to prevent the discrimination of orphans. According to <b>informants,</b> <b>the</b> demand for pre-school education has also come about {{because of the presence of}} an increasing number of idle children in communities due to, among other factors, being very young for enrolment into primary school; lack of educational facilities within a reasonable walking distance; no one being at home to take care of children; and parents/guardians failure to pay a fee required at private nursery schools. Consequently, these idle children disturbed their parents and guardians from performing economically productive activities. Thus, the establishment of CBCCs was meant to preoccupy such children with certain activities and prevent them from disturbing guardians in doing their work. CBCCs were also established in order to provide protection to young children. Some respondents revealed that young children in most communities are vulnerable to many threats. Children are at risk of being bullied, physical and sexual abuses and accidents when they are left alone at home. Having a CBCC in a community therefore, meant that children were less exposed to such threats.|$|R
40|$|Background This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between human health and nature. The motivation for the study is to examine if nature that citizens have access to {{in their daily lives}} {{can be used as a}} mean to relieve stress and promote general wellbeing. The results of the study are based on a problem statement that focuses on how stress sick people experience having mindful and sensuous activities in nature. This problem statement is significant and relevant because – to my knowledge – there are no psychological studies on how stress sick citizens experiences the use of local public green areas for stress reduction. Approach The study has a phenomenological standpoint. Its empirical basis consists of observation and interviews with a group of stress sick informants during a 7 week course of stress intervention once a week. The analytical approach is based on Reflective Lifeworld Research. With Reflective Lifeworld Research the aim is to capture the essence of the experiences of the stress sick during their stay in nature. The consequence of this thinking is that the essence is not something that the researcher adds through interpretation. Therefore <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> immediate experiences are analyzed without using external material e. g. theory and hypotheses. The reason for this is to let the experiences speak for themselves, without having interpretations of reality distract from it. Since the external material is not included in the analysis, it is added later on in the discussion of the analytical findings. Findings The analysis consists of seven constituents that together form the essence of the stress sick informants’ experiences of having mindful and sensuous activities in nature with the aim to reduce stress and promote well-being. These constituents are: 1) Stress symptoms despite natural surroundings. Several informants experiences stress symptoms in the form of aversion and tension, when they start having mindful and sensuous activities in nature. The aversion and tension is experienced as restlessness, discomfort, chaotic thoughts and sadness. 2) Being mindful and sensuous in nature. When <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> attention is <b>aware</b> of colors, smells and sounds of nature, they experience that thoughts come and go without the usual commitment. Hereby they mentally transforms from a ‘decisive’ state, where they are thinking about what they should do or what should be different, to a ‘being’ state, where they are simply present and focus on what is happening in the present. 3) Being comfortable relaxed in nature. <b>The</b> <b>informants</b> experience what they see, feel, hear and smell in the nature as relaxing. The activities in nature, such as sitting in front of a fire, doing breathing exercises or hanging in the hammock between the trees, creates physical and mental relaxation. In addition <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> experience that <b>the</b> stays in nature makes them better able to rest and sleep, which they point out as a factor increasing well-being in their everyday life. 4) Nature is a free space. <b>The</b> <b>informants</b> experience nature as a free space, where they feel that they can be themselves. Their problems related to stress seem of less importance, when they are engrossed in all the sensory impressions in nature. 5) The group interaction is anchored in the outdoor experience. <b>The</b> <b>informants</b> have meaningful experiences based on being with each other in nature. Everyone accepts each other in spite of their own vulnerability and stress sickness. Thereby they feel that the demands of the group does not exceed their resources. They experience is that the non-demanding socializing where everyone has similar needs or reasons for being in nature, provides a nourishing bond. 6) <b>The</b> <b>informants</b> experience a connection to nature. They experience an increased awareness in nature. The existential and essential experience goes beyond their thinking mind and transcends them from their focus on themselves. Their problems seem smaller when they are outside, because they experience a sense of only being ‘a small piece of the universe’. They find that even though life circumstances are stressful, nature shows that life goes on, leaves die in the fall, but new ones grow out in spring. 7) Nature as a health strategy that creates stress reduction and well-being. It appears that there is a multifaceted picture of <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> needs for stress management. <b>The</b> <b>informants</b> experience both a need for relaxation, but also a need for more energy. The mindful and sensuous stays in nature meet both needs. <b>The</b> <b>informants</b> experience energy and relaxation when being mindful of the sensations in nature. In regards to the long-term health benefits of <b>the</b> intervention, <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> I interviewed half a year after they participated in the intervention describe that they experience nature more intense and present than they previously did. These informants use their gardens and local nature areas in a strategy to reduce stress and increase well-being in their everyday life. Conclusion This study concludes that the stress sick experience mindful and sensual activities in nature as stress reducing and profitable for their well-being. Characteristic stress symptoms such as insomnia, poor concentration and restlessness improves by being in nature. <b>The</b> <b>informants</b> also experience relaxation and balance of body and mind. Despite these positive results, some stress symptoms can be expected when stress sick people initiate having mindful and sensual stay in nature. It can sometimes be uncomfortable to be introduced to unfamiliar physical and mental sensations under the mindful and sensual activities. An interesting result of the study is that the sensory experiences of nature can be profitable for being mindful and this can intensify the sensory experiences in nature. This interaction between sensory and mindfulness makes <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> more <b>aware</b> and present. Furthermore, the study finds that <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> experience of a connection to nature can be used therapeutically as it makes problems appear smaller, because of the recognition that they are only a small piece in the universe and that life goes on despite their current struggles. Finally, the results indicate a long term effect of the 7 week stress intervention, since <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> keep using nature after the intervention in a mindful and sensuous way to reduce stress and increase well-being, and to have a free space in their everyday life. Recommendation It can be beneficial to include the nature, which citizens have access to in their everyday life in health promotion and health strategies that aim to reduce stress and increase the well-being of stress sick people. The main effort though, should be of a preventive character to avoid severe stress cases. Nature is not as a substitute for changing the stressors in the hectic work and everyday life that creates risk of stress. Keywords Nature based health promotion, Stress reduction, well-being...|$|R

General practitioners (GP) are encouraged to advise on smoking cessation at all suitable consultations. Unsolicited advice from GPs results in one of 40 - 60 smokers stopping smoking. Smoking cessation advice has traditionally been given on an individual basis. Our aim was to gain insights that may help general practitioners understand why people smoke, and why smokers stop and then remain quitting and, from this, to find fruitful approaches to the dialogue about stopping smoking. Methods Interviews with 18 elderly smokers and ex-smokers about their smoking and decisions to smoke or quit were analysed with qualitative content analysis across narratives.

Results Six stages in the smoking story emerged, from the start of smoking, where friends had a huge influence, until maintenance of the possible cessation. <b>The</b> <b>informants</b> were influenced by "all the others" at all stages.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Mortality data provide {{essential}} {{evidence on}} the health status of populations in crisis-affected and resource-poor settings and to guide and assess relief operations. Retrospective surveys are commonly used to collect mortality data in such populations, but require substantial resources and have important methodological limitations. We evaluated the feasibility of an alternative method for rapidly quantifying mortality (<b>the</b> <b>informant</b> method). <b>The</b> study objective {{was to assess the}} economic feasibility of <b>the</b> <b>informant</b> method. METHODS: <b>The</b> <b>informant</b> method captures deaths through an exhaustive search for all deaths occurring in a population over a defined and recent recall period, using key community informants and next-of-kin of decedents. Between July and October 2008, we implemented and evaluated <b>the</b> <b>informant</b> method in: Kabul, Afghanistan; Mae La camp for Karen refugees, Thai-Burma border; Chiradzulu District, Malawi; and Lugufu and Mtabila refugee camps, Tanzania. We documented the time and cost inputs for <b>the</b> <b>informant</b> method in each site, and compared these with projections for hypothetical retrospective mortality surveys implemented in the same site with a 6 month recall period and with a 30 day recall period. FINDINGS: <b>The</b> <b>informant</b> method was estimated to require an average of 29 % less time inputs and 33 % less monetary inputs across all four study sites when compared with retrospective surveys with a 6 month recall period, and 88 % less time inputs and 86 % less monetary inputs when compared with retrospective surveys with a 1 month recall period. Verbal autopsy questionnaires were feasible and efficient, constituting only 4 % of total person-time for <b>the</b> <b>informant</b> method's implementation in Chiradzulu District. CONCLUSIONS: <b>The</b> <b>informant</b> method requires fewer resources and incurs less respondent burden. The method's generally impressive feasibility and the near real-time mortality data it provides warrant further work to develop the method given the importance of mortality measurement in such settings...|$|R
40|$|Syftet med uppsatsen är att utifrån kvalitativ data synliggöra perspektiv på genus och könsstereotyper, i kombination med organisation. Empirin utgår från fyra informanters perspektiv på dessa frågor, med utgångspunkt från deras egen arbetssituation. Grunden i intervjuerna har varit hur informanterna ställer sig till det faktum att de befinner sig i minoritet könsmässigt på arbetsplatsen och hur detta påverkar arbetssituationen, samt vad som gjort att de valt att bryta könsmönstret i ett annars segregerat arbetsliv. Teorin tar sin utgångspunkt i skapandet av kön och genus i kombination med organisation. Samt lyfts en diskussion kring avvikelse som utgår från Erving Goffmans begrepp stigma. Resultaten visar att informanterna varit medvetna om sin minoritetssituation, både i positiv och också i negativ bemärkelse. Mestadels anser de dock att de kunnat ingå som en del av gruppgemenskapen. De har dock alla vid olika tillfällen tvingats ta ställning till den könsstruktur som finns på arbetsplatsen. The {{purpose of}} this paper, {{which is based on}} {{qualitative}} data, is to highlight the perspectives of gender and gender stereotypes, in combination to organization. The empirical data is based on four individuals’ perspectives on these issues, based on their work situation. The basis of the interviews has been to understand the informants' attitudes, {{to the fact that they}} are in gender minority at the workplace, and how this affects the work situation. And also what made them chose to break the gender pattern in an otherwise segregated working life. The theory is based on the creation of sex and gender in combination to organization. And also a discussion on difference is raised, based on Erving Goffman's definition of stigma. The results show that <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> have been <b>aware</b> of their gender minority position, both in positive and also in a negative sense. They have all at various times been forced to consider the gender structure at the workplace. Though, mostly they believe that they can be a part of the group, despite their minority situation...|$|R
40|$|Assessment of {{the level}} of the pupils´ {{knowledge}} and understanding are important parts of teaching. There are diverse ways to do this and many different tools to use. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore, through qualitative interviews, how five teachers work with assessment. The focus lies on both how they work with assessment in general and how they use the assessment tools called »LUS» and »Nya språket lyfter!». The pupils´ participation in their own education is an important part of the Swedish curriculum, which is why the study also focuses on how <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> work to enable the pupils´ participation in the assessment and in their education. <b>The</b> <b>informants</b> all think that both assessment and the pupils´ participation in the assessment are important, since teaching is easier when the pupils are aware of what they need to know and learn. Many of <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> express that time is an issue when it comes to <b>making</b> <b>the</b> assessment trustworthy. They need to have time to discuss assessment and the interpretation of the curriculum with colleagues, which is not always possible. In spite of this hurdle most of them think that they enable their pupils´ participation and that an assessment tool is an important aid that both furthers this and makes assessment easier and more trustworthy...|$|R
