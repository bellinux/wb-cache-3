40|$|To achieve {{clean air}} in our cities, all modern means <b>of</b> ground {{transportation}} <b>make</b> use <b>of</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters.</b> Precious metal-based catalysts such as Pt and Pd are currently used in <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters.</b> To achieve higher fuel efficiency, combustion {{can be carried}} out in excess air resulting in a reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Reduction of these emissions has emerged as a major challenge. Most of the pollutants are emitted within the first 30 seconds after starting an engine because the catalyst is cold. The development of catalysts which achieve high activity at low temperatures will improve fuel efficiency and therefore reduce the nation’s dependence on foreign fossil fuels. The supplies of precious metals are limited worldwide, but there is increasing demand for clean energy. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} develop more active catalysts that provide long-term stable performance at elevated temperatures with minimal use of precious metals such as platinum. A major problem is that catalysts lose activity during use. Pt particles sinter, leading to poor stability. There is universal agreement that addition of Pd improves the catalytic performance as well as the durability of the Pt catalysts; however, the mechanisms by which Pd improves the performance of Pt are less clear. Conventional supported catalysts (Pt, Pd, and Pt-Pd) have been used to explore the microstructure of diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs) in their working state (i. e. under oxidizing conditions). Model catalysts have been used to study the evolution of platinum and palladium nanoparticles. Both a statistical and a microscopic approach have been used to understand the ways in which Pd affects Pt. The catalytic activity and kinetics of various monometallic as well as bimetallic powder catalysts aged under different conditions has also been studied. NO oxidation in the presence of NO, O 2, and NO 2 was the probe reaction used to distinguish between the differing activities of Pt/Al 2 O 3 and Pt-Pd/Al 2 O 3. The work described here focuses on important problems in the field of catalysis. A fundamental understanding of the role of palladium on both the catalytic activity and long-term performance of platinum catalysts has been gained.

One of the problems faced by designers is obtaining the performance <b>of</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters</b> where the substrate {{is made up of}} a large number of cells.

The adapted sub-grid scale modeling was used to predict the pressure loss, select the cell shape and produce the performance chart which could show the relationship between the parameters involved. The proposed adapted sub-grid scale modelling method was found to give results within 5 % error which was better compared to the single channel method. Results also indicated the advantage of hexagonal-shaped over square-shaped cells in terms of pressure loss where the former showed a 43 % lower value than the latter.
