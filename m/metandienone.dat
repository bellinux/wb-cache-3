25|$|Methyltestosterone and ethyltestosterone (17α-ethyltestosterone) are {{the parent}} {{structures}} of all 17α-alkylated AAS. Major 17α-alkylated AAS include the testosterone derivatives fluoxymesterone, <b>metandienone</b> (methandrostenolone), and methyltestosterone and the DHT derivatives oxandrolone, oxymetholone, and stanozolol.|$|E
25|$|Methyltestosterone, {{also known}} as 17α-methyltestosterone or as 17α-methylandrost-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic, 17α-alkylated androstane steroid and a {{derivative}} of testosterone differing from it only {{in the presence of}} a methyl group at the C17α position. Close synthetic relatives of methyltestosterone include <b>metandienone</b> (17α-methyl-δ1-testosterone) and fluoxymesterone (9α-fluoro-11β-hydroxy-17α-methyltestosterone).|$|E
50|$|Following further FDA pressure, CIBA withdrew Dianabol in 1983. Generic {{production}} {{shut down}} two years later, when the FDA revoked <b>metandienone's</b> approval entirely in 1985. Non-medical use was outlawed in the US under the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990.|$|R
25|$|Testosterone, {{which is}} {{available}} as a pharmaceutical drug, is metabolized in part to estrogens such as estradiol, and can produce significant estrogenic effects at high dosages, most notably gynecomastia in males. The {{same is true for}} some synthetic anabolic–androgenic steroids, like methyltestosterone and <b>metandienone.</b> DHEA is available over-the-counter as a dietary supplement in the United States (but not in many other countries), though it is only very weakly estrogenic.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used AAS in medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but {{most commonly}} testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (most commonly nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and <b>metandienone</b> (methandrostenolone). Others also available and used commonly but {{to a lesser extent}} include methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, mesterolone, and oxymetholone, as well as drostanolone propionate, metenolone (methylandrostenolone), and fluoxymesterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; androstanolone, stanolone) and its esters are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine. Boldenone undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|The {{pharmacodynamics}} of AAS are unlike peptide hormones. Water-soluble peptide hormones cannot {{penetrate the}} fatty cell membrane and only indirectly affect {{the nucleus of}} target cells through their interaction with the cell’s surface receptors. However, as fat-soluble hormones, AAS are membrane-permeable and influence the nucleus of cells by direct action. The pharmacodynamic action of AAS begin when the exogenous hormone penetrates the membrane of the target cell and binds to an androgen receptor (AR) located in the cytoplasm of that cell. From there, the compound hormone-receptor diffuses into the nucleus, where it either alters the expression of genes or activates processes that send signals {{to other parts of}} the cell. Different types of AAS bind to the AAR with different affinities, depending on their chemical structure. Some AAS such as <b>metandienone</b> bind weakly to this receptor in vitro, but still exhibit AR-mediated effects in vivo. The reason for this discrepancy is not known.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone can be metabolized by {{aromatase}} into estradiol, {{and many}} other AAS can be metabolized into their corresponding estrogenic metabolites as well. As an example, the 17α-alkylated AAS methyltestosterone and <b>metandienone</b> are converted by aromatase into methylestradiol. 4,5α-Dihydrogenated derivatives of testosterone such as DHT cannot be aromatized, whereas 19-nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone can be but to a greatly reduced extent. Some 19-nortestosterone derivatives, such as dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, cannot be aromatized due to steric hindrance provided by their 11β-methyl group, whereas the closely related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone), in relation to its lack of an 11β-methyl group, can be aromatized. AAS that are 17α-alkylated (and not also 4,5α-reduced or 19-demethylated) are also aromatized but {{to a lesser extent}} than is testosterone. However, it is notable that estrogens that are 17α-substituted (e.g., ethinylestradiol and methylestradiol) are of markedly increased estrogenic potency due to improved metabolic stability, and for this reason, 17α-alkylated AAS can actually have high estrogenicity and comparatively greater estrogenic effects than testosterone.|$|E
25|$|In late 1989, Robinson gave an {{interview}} with Stern in West Germany accusing a number of figures in American track and field of using and distributing performance-enhancing drugs. In October, The Athletics Congress (later USA Track & Field) had allowed the voluntary resignation of Robinson's former coach Chuck DeBus for giving banned substances to his athletes. Robinson said in Stern that, while staying at his house in 1982, he had seen Carl Lewis inject himself with a white fluid – what he believed to be testosterone. Furthermore, {{he said he had}} seen Tom Tellez (Lewis' coach) distribute blue pills to his athletes and claimed that these were banned steroids. Robinson had begun training with Bob Kersee in 1987 and he claimed that the coach had advised him on steroid use and given him two types of tablets; oxandrolone and <b>metandienone.</b> Robinson also claimed that he had personally sold a 10-cubic centimetre vial of human growth hormone to Florence Griffith-Joyner in March 1988, just months before she ran two world records and won an Olympic gold medal.|$|E

50|$|Chlorodehydromethyltestosterone (CDMT) (brand name Oral Turinabol) is an anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS). It is the 4-chloro-substituted {{derivative}} of <b>metandienone</b> (dehydromethyltestosterone) (Dianabol). CDMT {{was the first}} original product of Jenapharm, an East German pharmaceutical company. The patent registration took place in 1961. The idea of combining the structures of 4-chlorotestosterone (clostebol) and <b>metandienone</b> originated from the chemist Albert Stachowiak. At the time this represented a unique dissociation of anabolic and androgenic effects after oral administration. The product had been introduced for clinical use in 1965.|$|E

50|$|All {{synthetic}} AAS are derivatives of testosterone. Prominent {{examples include}} nandrolone (19-nortestosterone), <b>metandienone</b> (17α-methyl-δ1-testosterone), and stanozolol (a 17α-alkylated derivative of DHT). Unlike testosterone, AAS that are 17α-alkylated, like <b>metandienone</b> and stanozolol, are orally active. This {{is due to}} steric hindrance of C17β-position metabolism during the first-pass through the liver. In contrast, most AAS that are not 17α-alkylated, like nandrolone, are not active orally, and must instead be administered via intramuscular injection. This is almost always in ester form; for instance, {{in the case of}} nandrolone, as nandrolone decanoate or nandrolone phenylpropionate.|$|E
