5|$|The body wall {{consists}} of an epidermal layer, a jellylike mesogloea layer and an inner gastrodermis; the septa are infoldings of the body wall and consist of a layer of mesogloea sandwiched between two layers of gastrodermis. In some taxa, sphincter <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mesogloea close over the oral disc and act to keep the polyp fully retracted. The tentacles contain extensions of the coelenteron and have sheets of longitudinal muscles in their walls. The oral disc has radial <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> epidermis, {{but most of the}} <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> column are gastrodermal, and include strong retractor muscles beside the septa. The number and arrangement of the septa, as well as the arrangement of these retractor muscles, are important in anthozoan classification.|$|E

5|$|Digestion {{starts in}} buccal cavity (mouth) as {{partially}} chewed food is {{broken down by}} saliva from the salivary glands. As the salivary glands produce fluid and carbohydrate-digesting enzymes (mostly amylases), strong <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pharynx pump fluid into the buccal cavity, lubricating the food like the salivarium does, and helping blood feeders, and xylem and phloem feeders.|$|E

5|$|When prey is swallowed, it is {{liquefied}} in the pharynx by enzymes and by muscular contractions of the pharynx. The resulting slurry is wafted {{through the}} canal system by {{the beating of}} the cilia, and digested by the nutritive cells. The ciliary rosettes in the canals may help to transport nutrients to <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mesoglea. The anal pores may eject unwanted small particles, but most unwanted matter is regurgitated via the mouth.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
5|$|Biomechanical {{studies by}} Ken Carpenter in 2002 {{confirmed}} that the most likely function of the forelimbs in predation was grasping, as their great lengths would have permitted longer reach than for most other theropods. The rather large and elongated coracoid, indicating powerful <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forelimbs, further strengthened this interpretation. Carpenter's biomechanical studies using bone casts also showed that Deinonychus could not fold its arms against its body like a bird ("avian folding"), contrary to what was inferred from the earlier 1985 descriptions by Jacques Gauthier and Gregory S. Paul in 1988.|$|E

5|$|Flies tend {{to fly in}} a {{straight}} line then make a rapid change in direction before continuing on a different straight path. The directional changes are called saccades and typically involve an angle of 90°, being achieved in 50 milliseconds. They are initiated by visual stimuli as the fly observes an object, nerves then activate steering <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn. Detecting this within four or five wingbeats, the halteres trigger a counter-turn and the fly heads off in a new direction.|$|E
5|$|Motor {{systems are}} {{areas of the}} brain that are {{involved}} in initiating body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.|$|E
5|$|Respiration {{involves}} drawing {{water into}} the mantle cavity through an aperture, passing it through the gills, and expelling it through the siphon. The ingress of water is achieved by contraction of radial <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mantle wall, and flapper valves shut when strong circular muscles force the water out through the siphon. Extensive connective tissue lattices support the respiratory muscles {{and allow them to}} expand the respiratory chamber. The lamella structure of the gills allows for a high oxygen uptake; up to 65% in water at 20⁰C. Water flow over the gills correlates with locomotion, and an octopus can propel its body when it expels water out of its siphon.|$|E

5|$|SCI {{can lead}} to {{significant}} insecurities, which have repercussions for sexuality and self-image. SCI often affects body image, either due to the host {{of changes in the}} body that affect appearance (e.g. unused <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> legs become atrophied), or due to changes in self-perception not directly from physical changes. People frequently find themselves less attractive and expect others not to be attracted to them after SCI. These insecurities cause fear of rejection and deter people from initiating contact or sexual activity or engaging in sex. Feelings of undesirability or worthlessness even lead some to suggest to their partners that they find someone able bodied.|$|E
5|$|The {{proboscis}} is an infolding of {{the body}} wall, and sits in the rhynchocoel when inactive. When <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wall of the rhynchocoel compress the fluid in the rhynchocoel, the pressure makes the proboscis jump inside-out to attack the animal's prey along a canal called the rhynchodeum and through an orifice, the proboscis pore. The proboscis has a muscle which attaches {{to the back of}} the rhynchocoel, and which can stretch up to 30 times its inactive length and then retract the proboscis.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequence}} of movements {{in which a}} horse takes a step with all four legs is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, a horse completes four movements: the swing phase, the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move, the legs perform the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. Good movement is sound, symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on many factors, including conformation, soundness, care and training of the horse, and terrain and footing. The proportions and length of the bones and <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> legs can significantly impact the way an individual horse moves. The angles of certain bones, especially in the hind leg, shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.|$|E

Propantheline {{can also be}} used to treat excessive sweating because acetylcholine block also reduces secretions such as sweat and tears.|$|R
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has played}} an enormous role in refining the wings, control and sensory systems, {{and anything else}} that affects aerodynamics or kinematics. One noteworthy trait is wing twist. Most insect wings are twisted, as are helicopter blades, with a higher angle of attack at the base. The twist generally is between 10 and 20 degrees. In addition to this twist, the wing surfaces are not necessarily flat or featureless; most larger insects have wing membranes distorted and angled between the veins {{in such a way that}} the cross-section of the wings approximates an airfoil. Thus, the wing's basic shape already is capable of generating a small amount of lift at zero angle of attack. Most insects control their wings by adjusting tilt, stiffness, and flapping frequency of the wings with tiny <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thorax (below). Some insects evolved other wing features that are not advantageous for flight, but play a role in something else, such as mating or protection.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} {{a ring of}} four ganglia, {{positioned}} around the rhynchocoel near its front end. At least a pair of ventral nerve cords connect to the brain and run {{along the length of}} the body. Most nemerteans have various chemoreceptors, and on their heads some species have a number of pigment-cup ocelli. These ocelli can detect light but can not form an image. Nemerteans respire through the skin. They have at least two lateral vessels which are joined at the ends to form a loop, and these and the rhynchocoel are filled with fluid. There is no heart, and the flow of fluid depends on contraction of <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vessels and the body wall. To filter out soluble waste products, flame cells are embedded in the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels, and remove the wastes through a network of pipes to the outside.|$|E
5|$|The order Rodentia may {{be divided}} into suborders, infraorders, superfamilies and families. There {{is a great deal}} of {{parallelism}} and convergence among rodents caused by the fact that they have tended to evolve to fill largely similar niches. This parallel evolution includes not only the structure of the teeth, but also the infraorbital region of the skull (below the eye socket) and makes classification difficult as similar traits may not be due to common ancestry. Brandt (1855) was the first to propose dividing Rodentia into three suborders, Sciuromorpha, Hystricomorpha and Myomorpha, based on the development of certain <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jaw and this system was widely accepted. Schlosser (1884) performed a comprehensive review of rodent fossils, mainly using the cheek teeth, and found that they fitted into the classical system, but Tullborg (1899) proposed just two sub-orders, Sciurognathi and Hystricognathi. These were based on the degree of inflection of the lower jaw and were to be further subdivided into Sciuromorpha, Myomorpha, Hystricomorpha and Bathyergomorpha. Matthew (1910) created a phylogenetic tree of New World rodents but did not include the more problematic Old World species. Further attempts at classification continued without agreement, with some authors adopting the classical three suborder system and others Tullborg's two suborders.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} main muscle {{groups of the}} forelimb. The triceps muscle {{straightens}} the elbow and foreleg, running from the elbow {{to the bottom of}} the shoulder blade. The muscles which extend the lower leg are called extensor muscles, while the flexion of the lower leg joints is achieved through movement of the flexor muscles. There are five main muscles and muscle groups in the hind legs. The vastus muscle flexes the hind leg and runs from stifle to hip, while the gluteal muscles, the large <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hip, extend the femur. Forward motion and flexion of the hind legs is achieved through the movement of the quadriceps group of muscles on the front of the femur, while the muscles at the back of the hindquarters, called the hamstring group, provide forward motion of the body and rearward extension of the hind limbs. Extension of the hock is achieved by the Achilles tendon, located above the hock.|$|E
5|$|Most aquatic stereospondyls have {{flattened}} heads. When feeding, {{they probably}} opened their mouths by lifting their skulls instead of lowering their lower jaws. The jaw {{mechanics of the}} plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is well known, {{and is one of}} the most highly adapted. Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto-occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck. As the skull is raised, the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward. Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls, but they are not as well adapted for such movement. D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls. He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus, a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax, was able to make the same movement. Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959, suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way. At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles, but it is now thought that they used larger <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle. Plagiosuchus, a close relative of Gerrothorax, also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to. Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull, suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth.|$|E

50|$|This disease {{takes two}} forms: typical and atypical. <b>In</b> typical form, <b>the</b> {{twitching}} usually starts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower eyelid <b>in</b> orbicularis oculi <b>muscle.</b> As time progresses, it spreads {{to the whole}} lid, then to the orbicularis oris muscle around the lips, and buccinator <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cheekbone area. The reverse process of twitching occurs in atypical hemifacial spasm; twitching starts <b>in</b> orbicularis oris <b>muscle</b> around the lips, and buccinator <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cheekbone area <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower face, then progresses up to <b>the</b> orbicularis oculi <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eyelid as time progresses.
