40|$|Phenol, p-cresol, and {{volatile}} fatty acids (VFA; acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric, and valeric acids) were used as odor indicators of swine waste. Aeration of the waste allowed the indigenous microorganisms to grow and degrade these <b>malodorous</b> <b>substances.</b> The time required for degradation of these substances varied according to the waste used, {{and it was not}} necessarily related to their concentrations. Using a minimal medium which contained one of the malodorous compounds as sole carbon source, we have selected from swine waste microorganisms that can grow in the medium. The majority of these microorganisms were able to degrade the same substrate when inoculated in sterilized swine waste but with an efficiency varying from one strain to the other. None of these strains was able to degrade all <b>malodorous</b> <b>substances</b> studied. Within 6 days of incubation these selected strains degraded the following: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, phenol and all VFA; Alcaligenes faecalis, p-cresol and all VFA; Corynebacterium glutamicum and Micrococcus sp., phenol, p-cresol, and acetic and propionic acids; Arthrobacter flavescens, all VFA. On a laboratory scale, the massive inoculation of swine waste with C. glutamicum or Micrococcus sp. accelerated degradation of the <b>malodorous</b> <b>substances.</b> However, this effect was not observed with all of the various swine wastes tested. These results suggest that an efficient deodorization process of various swine wastes could be developed at the farm level based on the aerobic indigenous microflora of each waste...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} the new safety antipollution checkups being applied to pulp mills. The origin of malodors in Kraft pulp mills must be sought {{primarily in the}} use of direct contact evaporators, and not at the recovery site. A modern Kraft recovery system can regulate flue gas incineration to the extent that undesirable gases are completely incinerated. Using heavy wood lye oxidation before the lye comes into contact with the combustion gases in the direct contact evaporator, the amount of <b>malodorous</b> <b>substances</b> can be restricted. Alternative methods for odor control in the pulp mill are discussed, including the Ljungstrom type laminar air heater, multipole effect evaporation to a high concentration, bypassing the direct contact evaporator and the Copeland system...|$|E
40|$|Adipose tissue {{contains}} low-molecular-weight soluble substances {{which are}} utilized in preference to lipid for bacterial growth. These components {{are present in}} low concentration at the surface of adipose tissue, and the pH of the surface is high (greater than 7. 0). Bacteria growing on {{a thin layer of}} agar over an adipose tissue surface utilized glucose preferentially, but this was soon exhausted in the vicinity of colonies. Amino acids were then attacked, producing <b>malodorous</b> <b>substances</b> which were detectable as spoilage odors when the cell density was about 10 (6) /cm 2. Growth ceased at a cell density approaching 10 (8) /cm 2 because of substrate limitation.

40|$|The {{amounts of}} {{volatile}} substances {{responsible for the}} malodor of human waste (feces and urine) obtained from the storage tank of a community waste-water treatment plant were determined. Thus far, {{there has been little}} systematic research on malodor-causing substances of human waste. These substances were collected using Tenax-TA, and their concentrations were determined by the usual thermal-desorption cold-trap injector/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (TCT/GC/MS). About 90 % of the malodor-causing substances were fatty acids: acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid. The proportion of ammonia was 6. 5 %. Other malodor-causing and minor substances detected were indole, skatole, pyridine, pyrrole, hydro-gen sulfide, and methyl mercaptan. In addition, a small amount of paradichlorobenzene used as a deodorizer in household toilets was also recognized. Key words —– — human waste, <b>malodorous</b> <b>substance,</b> TCT/GC/M...|$|R
40|$|Peg feces, a <b>malodorous</b> <b>substance</b> causing {{environmental}} pollution, {{were completely}} deodorized within 2 days by Streptomyces. The optimum conditions for deodorization were as follows: pH, 8. 6 to 10; temperature, 35 to 40 degrees C; moisture content, 42 to 63 %; and {{minimum amount of}} inoculum, 2 g of seed culture per 10 g of fresh feces. Many kinds of microorganisms were isolated from the deodorized feces, of which only actinomycetes {{were found to have}} the ability to deodorize. Two strains with strong deodorizing activity were identified as Streptomyces griseus and Streptomyces antibioticus. The low-molecular-weight fatty acids, which are the specific malodorous agents of pig feces, scarcely could be found in feces deodorized by the isolated strains. Chemical analysis showed that the deodorized feces are useful as manure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A new {{biological}} deodorization technology {{which is}} used in Tianjin Jizhuangzi Sewage Plant was introduced in this paper. The geographical position of Jizhuangzi Wastewater Treatment Plant is special. The plant has been surrounded by the living area. The problem of odor to people has been serious until a new deodorization technology is used. It is a source deodorization technology used special filler through vaccination, induction and catalytic to removed the malodorous sources. A special microbial incubator is used to culture and proliferate effective deodorant microorganisms on activated sludge sewage in the biological pool of the plant and then the sludge containing deodorant microbial reflowed to the wastewater inlet. The <b>malodorous</b> <b>substances</b> in the water are removed through adsorption, cohesion, biotransformation degradation and so on by the deodorant microbial. The case indicates that this technology is effective in practice and good for popularization. And this technology with simple process showed significant effect compared with other deodorant technologies and was more secure and convenient to build and run with low cost...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{technologies}} {{exist for the}} treatment of malodorous air streams, including adsorption, absorption, catalytic combustion, biofiltration and bioscrubbing. Conventional packed bed biofiltration of <b>malodorous</b> <b>substances</b> from waste gas streams has the disadvantages of large unit surface area and relatively uncontrolled design principles. The large bed surface area leads to difficulties in maintaining even moisture and temperature profiles. In addition, the control of such biologically important parameters as pH is difficult. Novel fluidized/spouted beds were studied for biological treatment of gases because of their high specific gas flowrate and vigorous mixing which facilitates enhanced gas–biomass contact. Trials of a range of fluidized and spouted beds, with gas loadings of up to 14000 m 3 -gas m− 2 -bed h− 1, were carried out on various biofilm support media including glass ballotini, rice hulls, plastic discs and granules, silica gel, molecular sieves, vermiculite, perlite, activated carbon, cork, polystyrene and expanded clay. Severe aggregation and wall adhesion restricted the operational range of the reactors. Particle suitability was based on a combination of shape, density, size, porosity and wettability, with large, heavy clay particles performing best. Limited gas-phase bacterial studies on selected media with ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria demonstrated the potential of fluidized/spouted beds for efficient biofiltration of ammonia (20 – 40 mg dm− 3...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to characterise and {{quantify}} the emissions of volatile organic compounds that can be released into the air from stink blasters (a toy in human shape that releases <b>malodorous</b> <b>substances</b> after squeezing the head) and to evaluate possible health risks, particularly for children. Although the stink blasters are intended for outdoor use, a hypothetical indoor use (e. g. a child¿s room) has been considered relevant for exposure assessment studies. The emissions of the items were investigated in environmental chambers and their content was assessed by chemical extraction. In addition to these preliminary experiments and in order to evaluate airborne exposure to cyclohexanone, the stink blasters were placed in the Indoortron facility, a 30 m 3 volume walk-in type environmental chamber, and tested for emissions after squeezing several times under ¿real world setting¿ conditions (23 C, 50 % relative humidity, 0. 5 air changes per hour). The amount of chemicals released was determined by applying two different techniques and time series analysis of the air inside the chamber sampled on Tenax TA tubes and DNPH cartridges, followed by thermal desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry and HPLC¿UV, respectively. The main resulting compounds emitted were cyclohexanone and toluene, with concentrations reaching values of 25 and 32 mgm 3, respectively. These levels are much lower than established permissible exposure limits. Measured toluene levels are also below the chronic inhalation reference limit value (300 mgm 3) set for this compound by the California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal EPA). However, such a value is not set for cyclohexanone, so attention should be given to chronic exposures at low concentration levels, in particular for sensitive sub-groups such as children. JRC.

25|$|In 1934, Millikan {{referred}} I. H. Lyons {{from the}} National Postal Meter Company to Arnold Beckman. Lyons wanted a non-clogging ink so that postage could be printed by machines, {{instead of having}} clerks lick stamps. Beckman's solution was to make ink with butyric acid, a <b>malodorous</b> <b>substance.</b> Because of this ingredient, no manufacturer wanted to manufacture it. Beckman decided to make it himself. He started the National Inking Appliance Company, obtaining space in a garage owned by instrument maker Fred Henson and hiring two Caltech students, Robert Barton and Henry Fracker. Beckman developed {{and took out a}} couple of patents for re-inking typewriter ribbons, but marketing them was not successful. This was Beckman's first experience at running a company and marketing a product, and while this first product failed, Beckman repurposed the company for another product.|$|R
5000|$|Although Michael {{considers}} Packer to be {{his best}} friend, and even has him listed as his emergency contact, their friendship appears to be largely one-sided, with Packer treating Michael more like an audience for, and occasional target of, his jokes rather than a friend. He has used Michael as a scapegoat before, such as when Packer picked up a bouncer's girlfriend while he and Michael were at a convention, only to leave Michael behind, after which Michael was savagely beaten up by the bouncer and his friends. In [...] "Sexual Harassment", Michael recalls that once on a sales trip together he and Packer met female twins and brought {{them back to their}} hotel room.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to characterise and quantify the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be released into the air from stink blasters, a particular toy with human shape that releases <b>malodorous</b> <b>substances</b> after squeezing the head, and to evaluate possible health risks, in particular for children. Several notifications to the Rapid Alarm System for Non Food Products (RAPEX) were issued for the presence of cyclohexanone, a neurotoxic compound, in stink blasters. RAPEX is a system for the rapid exchange of information within the European Union on the dangers arising from consumer products, used by member states to communicate products that do not comply with EU legislation. Although the stink blasters are intended for outdoor use, a hypothetical indoor use (e. g. a child¿s room) has been considered relevant for exposure assessment studies.
