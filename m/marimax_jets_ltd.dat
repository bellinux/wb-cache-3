5000|$|Sir Rolf Dudley-Williams (1908-1987), {{co-founder and}} {{managing}} director, Power <b>Jets</b> <b>Ltd,</b> 1936-1944, and MP for Exeter, 1951-1966 ...|$|R
50|$|On 28 March 1944, after {{discussions with}} the Air Ministry, Whittle reluctantly agreed to the {{nationalisation}} of Power <b>Jets</b> <b>Ltd.</b> for £135,000, and the company became Power Jets (Research and Development) Ltd.|$|R
50|$|James Collingwood Burdett Tinling (24 March 1900-1983) was an ex-RAF {{officer who}} joined with Rolf Dudley-Williams and Frank Whittle in 1936 {{to set up}} Power <b>Jets</b> <b>Ltd,</b> which {{manufactured}} the world's first working jet engine.|$|R
50|$|Interest by Douglas Jack W.Cullum in {{the noise}} {{generated}} by aircraft engines and propellers {{led to the}} design of a silencer for the W2 700 jet engine developed by Sir Frank Whittle and his team at Power <b>Jets</b> <b>Ltd.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Tinling married Eileen Nancy Edols on 22 December 1939, at St George's, Hanover Square. He became {{chairman}} of Power Jets in 1941, replacing Lance Whyte, and its prototype Gloster E28/39 first flew on 15 May 1941. Power <b>Jets</b> <b>Ltd.</b> was later {{bought by the}} British government, and Tinling remained on the board.|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} of the turbojet-powered Gloster Meteor was a collaboration between the Gloster Aircraft Company and Sir Frank Whittle's firm, Power <b>Jets</b> <b>Ltd.</b> Whittle formed Power <b>Jets</b> <b>Ltd</b> in March 1936 to develop his ideas of jet propulsion, Whittle himself serving as the company's chief engineer. For several years, attracting financial backers and aviation firms prepared to take on Whittle's radical ideas was difficult; in 1931, Armstrong-Siddeley had evaluated and rejected Whittle's proposal, finding it to be technically sound but at the limits of engineering capability. Securing funding was a persistently worrying issue throughout the early {{development of}} the engine. The first Whittle prototype jet engine, the Power Jets WU, began running trials in early 1937; shortly afterwards, both Sir Henry Tizard, chairman of the Aeronautical Research Committee, and the Air Ministry gave the project their support.|$|R
5000|$|The strong {{relationship}} to aviation history in The Sound Barrier {{has led to}} its being characterised as a [...] "semi-documentary". The film pays tribute to the British effort in the historic advance in aviation of the development and final perfecting of the jet engine by Frank Whittle and Power <b>Jets</b> <b>Ltd</b> and others following.|$|R
50|$|Whittles {{engine was}} {{starting}} to look useful and his Power <b>Jets</b> <b>Ltd.</b> started receiving Air Ministry money. In 1941, a flyable version of the engine called the W.1, capable of 1000 lbf (4 kN) of thrust, was fitted to the Gloster E28/39 airframe specially built for it and first flew on 15 May 1941 at RAF Cranwell.|$|R
50|$|He {{became a}} leading {{figure in the}} British Liberal Party and was {{a partner in a}} firm of stockbrokers. He also held a number of {{business}} directorships with companies including:- Aero Engine Ltd, Alpha Cement Ltd, Earls Court Ltd, Blackburn and General Aircraft, Hanworth Securities Ltd, Scophony <b>Ltd,</b> Power <b>Jets</b> <b>Ltd</b> and was a partner with merchant bankers O.T. Falk and Partners, and stockbrokers Buckmaster & Moore.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, in Britain the Gloster E28/39 had its {{maiden flight}} on 15 May 1941 and the Gloster Meteor finally entered service with the RAF in July 1944. These were powered by {{turbojet}} engines from Power <b>Jets</b> <b>Ltd.,</b> {{set up by}} Frank Whittle. The first two operational turbojet aircraft, the Messerschmitt Me 262 and then the Gloster Meteor entered service within three months {{of each other in}} 1944.|$|R
50|$|In 1942 the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) Turbine Division {{moved to}} new {{facilities}} in Pyestock. In 1944 Power <b>Jets</b> <b>Ltd.</b> (set up by Frank Whittle and two colleagues in 1936) merged with the RAE Turbine Division and was nationalised to form Power Jets (Research and Development) Ltd. In 1946 it was reconstituted as {{a division of the}} Ministry of Supply to form the National Gas Turbine Establishment.|$|R
50|$|Power <b>Jets</b> <b>Ltd</b> {{was formed}} in March 1936. Manufacture of key engine {{components}} was undertaken by the British Thomson-Houston Company (BTH), starting in June 1936. Testing of the first engine, the WU, to demonstrate the concept, commenced on April 12, 1937. Because of a shortage of funds at Power Jets, engine components were in short supply, so development proceeded at a very slow pace.|$|R
50|$|Deciding {{to go into}} business, Williams {{joined with}} fellow Cranwell pupil Frank Whittle and fellow ex-RAF officer James Collingwood Tinling to set up Power <b>Jets</b> <b>Ltd</b> in 1936 to develop Whittle's idea of jet engines for aircraft. In 1941 he was {{appointed}} Managing Director, and in 1944 he joined the Council of the Society of British Aircraft Constructors and was made a Companion of the Royal Aeronautical Society.|$|R

The first part consists of theoretical bases of financial analysis. The second part contains the application of essential methods {{to the analysis of}} financial situation of the company. On the basis of the analysis are found weaknesses for which are designed the recommendations. The recommendations should lead to improved financial health of the company...|$|R
50|$|After MIT, he {{returned}} to Babcock & Wilcox. In 1940, he joined the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough. He was seconded from there to Power <b>Jets</b> <b>Ltd</b> at Lutterworth, where he worked with Frank Whittle on combustion chamber development for the jet engine. Building on {{his work on the}} mixing of fuel and air in flames at MIT, he derived the mixture for fast combustion; the chambers produced by his team were used in the first British jet aircraft.|$|R
25|$|Without Air Ministry support, {{he and two}} retired RAF {{servicemen}} formed Power <b>Jets</b> <b>Ltd</b> {{to build}} his engine with assistance from the firm of British Thomson-Houston. Despite limited funding, a prototype was created, which first ran in 1937. Official interest was forthcoming following this success, with contracts being placed to develop further engines, but the continuing stress seriously affected Whittle's health, eventually resulting in a nervous breakdown in 1940. In 1944 when Power Jets was nationalised he again suffered a nervous breakdown, and resigned from the board in 1946.|$|R
50|$|The {{decision}} to end {{production of the}} Avro RJ series was taken following the sharp downturn in aircraft sales following the September 11, 2001 attacks. British Aerospace (BAE's predecessor) had already left the corporate jet market in 1993, with the sale of British Aerospace Corporate <b>Jets</b> <b>Ltd.</b> (producers of the mid-sized British Aerospace BAe 125 line) to Raytheon, but had maintained the regional jet division. Its remaining commercial aerostructures manufacturing business was sold to Spirit AeroSystems in 2006. Regional Aircraft's headquarters are located at Prestwick International Airport, with an additional site in Weybridge.|$|R

50|$|He started <b>Jet</b> Petroleum <b>Ltd</b> in October 1953. Its first {{company address}} was 23 John William Street in Huddersfield. His first tanker had the {{registration}} JET 855. In 1961 Jet {{was bought by}} Conoco for £12.5m.|$|R
2500|$|The Gloster Meteor was {{the first}} British jet fighter and the Allies' only jet {{aircraft}} to achieve combat operations during the Second World War. The Meteor's development was heavily reliant on its ground-breaking turbojet engines, pioneered by Sir Frank Whittle and his company, Power <b>Jets</b> <b>Ltd.</b> Development of the aircraft began in 1940, although work on the engines had been under way since 1936. The Meteor first flew in 1943 and commenced operations on 27 July 1944 with No. 616 Squadron RAF. The Meteor was not a sophisticated aircraft in its aerodynamics, but {{proved to be a}} successful combat fighter. [...] Gloster's 1946 civil Meteor F.4 demonstrator G-AIDC {{was the first}} civilian-registered jet aircraft in the world.|$|R
50|$|Ruston & Hornsby {{produced}} {{diesel engines}} for ships and locomotives, then by {{teaming up with}} former colleagues of Frank Whittle and Power <b>Jets</b> <b>Ltd,</b> in the early 1950s, R & H (which became RGT) opened the first-ever production line to build gas turbine engines for land-based and sea-based energy production. Hugely successful, {{it was the largest}} single employer in the city, providing over 5,000 jobs in its factory and research facilities, making it a rich takeover target for industrial conglomerates. It was subsumed by English Electric in November 1966, which was then bought by GEC in 1968, with diesel engine production being transferred to the Ruston Diesels Division in Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire, at the former Vulcan Foundry, which was eventually bought by the German MAN Diesel (now MAN Diesel & Turbo) in June 2000.|$|R
5000|$|... 2003 was {{the year}} when Industrial Water <b>Jetting</b> Systems <b>Ltd</b> was bought, with bases in Bury St Edmunds, Lincoln, Grimsby and Maidstone; {{acquisition}} includes Branchand Tank Services and Aquaducks (domestic drainage). To complement this CW Tanker at Thetford was bought and additional IWJS bases were opened at Corby, Colchester and Guildford.|$|R
5000|$|Jemtex Ink <b>Jet</b> Printing <b>Ltd.,</b> a {{developer}} and manufacturer of inkjet digital printheads and engines {{for the large}} industrial printing market, based in Lod, Israel. Scitex commenced investing in this company, as a start-up, in May 2000. In August 2006, its interest having increased to 75%, it agreed a buyout by senior management of Jemtex, thus reducing its stake in Jemtex to 15%.|$|R
5000|$|Evans {{decided to}} sell {{non-core}} business activities which included The Rover Group, Arlington Securities, BAe Corporate Jets, BAe Communications and Ballast Nedam. Although the rationale of diversification was sound (to shield the company from cyclical aerospace and defence markets) the struggling company {{could not afford to}} continue the position: [...] "We simply could not afford to carry two core businesses, cars and aerospace. At one point Rover was eating up about £2 billion of our banking capacity." [...] BAe Corporate <b>Jets</b> <b>Ltd</b> and Arkansas Aerospace Inc were sold to Raytheon in 1993. In 1994 the Rover Group was sold to BMW and British Aerospace Space Systems was sold to Matra Marconi Space. In 1998 BAe's shareholding of Orange plc was reduced to 5%. The Orange shareholding was a legacy of the 30% stake in Hutchison Telecommunications (UK) Ltd when Hutchison exchanged its own shares for a mobile phone company (Microtel Communications Ltd) from BAe.|$|R
50|$|Norfolk <b>Jet</b> Express Pty <b>Ltd</b> was {{an airline}} based on Norfolk Island {{offering}} scheduled, international, domestic, passenger and cargo services. It ceased operations in June 2005 due to financial difficulties.|$|R

40|$|Titanium alloys {{are used}} {{extensively}} in the aerospace industry due to their high specific strength and excellent corrosion resistance. However, their poor thermal conductivity and high chemical reactivity with tool materials make the machining difficult, especially when grinding. During grinding, the excessive heat generated at the wheel-work piece interface may result in poor surface finisil, 1 _, a transformed surface layer, excessive plastic deformation, thermallyinduced residual tensile stress, burn and micro-cracking on the ground surface. The poor surface integrity and metallurgical changes of the surface and sub-surface may impair the surface sensitive properties such as fatigue life during service. ln order to overcome the thermal problems when grinding titanium alloys, a new cooling strategy, cryogenic grinding, was studied which involves the supply of liquid nitrogen into the grinding zone using a nozzle <b>jet</b> system. <b>lt</b> was found that cryo-cooling with conventional grinding wheel decreased surface roughness values, burn and plastic deformation of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloys and produced better a cutting mechanism than when using water-based coolant, especially at higher depths of cut. However, the thermal problems still introduced high residual tensile stress which degraded the fatigue life of ground specimens. Another approach to reducing the grinding temperature was to use a superabrasive wheel (diamond), because of its superior thermal conductivity, {{the integrity of the}} ground surface was improved and the fatigue life properties of the specimen were maintained at higher values than for conventional grinding wheels. An ultra stiff machine tool, Tetraform C, was also used to grind Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloys and under selected conditions the ground surface reached a good surface finish and the fatigue properties were also retained at lower depth of cut. An ELID system on the Tetraform C was also investigated. It produced a rougher surface finish in this study. However, it is believed that reducing the wheel loading problem when grinding titanium alloys may contribute to maintaining the fatigue properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{working party}} an "Cross-Field Transport (Particles and Energy) " took place an January 30 31, 1984 in Garching at the {{invitation}} of the NET team. The meeting was followed by 42 participants (Appendix 1 : List of Attendees), about two thirds of whom were theoreticians and one third experimental physicists; almost all the associations of the European Community were represented. Twentytwoo talks have been given followed by lively discussions; informal sessions were also held (Appendix 11 : Agenda) to try to clarify specific points. A common opinion of course did not emerge at once concerning the nature of the processes which are responsible for anomalous particles and energy transport in Tokamaks. However the confrontation of points of view was extremely fruitful as shown by the technical report which follows. I think personally that theory has now succeeded in providing the outline of a coherent picture of some of the aspects of the problem. The elucidation of these questions would of course be extremely important for <b>JET</b> and NET, <b>lt</b> was generally feit that the meeting, organized along the lines suggested by the PO-COFP, was useful to the participants and in my opinion should be repeated about every 18 months. Beside their intrinsic scientific interest, these meetings permit to improve the cohesion between the theoretical works pursued in the different associations, between the theoretical and experimental studies, and probably have a stimulating impact an the participants...|$|R
