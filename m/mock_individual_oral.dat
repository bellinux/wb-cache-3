Materials and methods: Data are derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 – 2004, which {{is linked to the}} National Death Index for mortality follow-up through 2006. We estimated the risk of mortality among people with three <b>individual</b> <b>oral</b> health conditions—tooth loss, root caries, and periodontitis as well as with oral comorbidity—or having all three conditions. Results: Significant tooth loss, root caries, and periodontal disease were associated with increased odds of dying. The relationship between oral health conditions and mortality disappeared when controlling for sociodemographic, health, and/or health behavioral indicators. Having multiple oral health problems was associated with an even higher rate of mortality. Conclusion: <b>Individual</b> <b>oral</b> health conditions—tooth loss, root caries, and periodontal disease—were not related to mortality when sociodemographic, health, and/or health behavioral factors were considered, and there was no differential pattern between the three conditions.

40|$|Background: The {{monitoring}} {{of infectious diseases}} like the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) using pen-wise oral fluid samples {{becomes more and more}} established. The collection of <b>individual</b> <b>oral</b> fluid, which would be useful in the {{monitoring of}} PRRSV negative boar studs, is rather difficult. The aim {{of the study was to}} test two methods for <b>individual</b> <b>oral</b> fluid collection from pigs and to evaluate the specificity of a commercial ELISA for detection of PRRSV antibodies in these sample matrices. For this reason, 334 serum samples from PRRSV negative pigs (group 1) and 71 serum samples from PRRSV positive pigs (group 2) were tested for PRRSV antibodies with a commercial ELISA. <b>Individual</b> <b>oral</b> fluid was collected with a cotton gauze swab from 311 pigs from group 1 and 39 pigs from group 2. Furthermore, 312 oral fluid samples from group 1 and 67 oral fluid samples from group 2 were taken with a self-drying foam swab (GenoTube).

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this article is to develop a new index system to {{identify}} the <b>individual</b> <b>oral</b> hygiene score (OHS) and the level of the motivation success by using some scales, which are an indicator of the <b>individual</b> <b>oral</b> hygiene status. In this way, the level of personal oral hygiene would be determined and a standard motivation success scale would be presented by comparing the oral hygiene levels measured before and after the motivation application. The Hypothesis: In this hypothesis, an index was primarily formed in order to obtain an individual OHS with the total values of plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), and calculus index (CI) scores. Motivation success levels of the individuals were calculated and classified by using the rate of change of OHS between the sessions. Evaluation of the Hypothesis: This index system would form a basis for future strategies in preventive dentistry. Standard and common scores in one individual or a wide population will be attained easily and effectively...|$|R

A specialist in geriatric dentistry is a dentist general practitioner with special knowledge and skills for delivering oral care to frail elderly people.

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the quality of data {{obtained}} from <b>individual</b> <b>oral</b> and group written administration of a classroom simulation test. The <b>individual</b> <b>oral</b> procedure involved one group of subjects taking the simulator test individually and responding orally, while the group written procedure involved another group writing their responses to the simulator test under group conditions. The sample consisted of 34 women majoring in elementary education at Oregon College of Education at Monmouth, Oregon. These subjects were matched on the basis of age and years of teaching experience. In each of the two different test procedure. the subjects responded to 11 short filmed episodes of the classroom behavior of 22 sixth grade children. The subjects enacted the role of student teacher and were asked to respond at any time during the filmed episode where they felt some response or action was needed. Each subject was equipped with a stop watch. This was used to indicate the point in time in the sequence of events that a subject chose to initiate a response or formulate a judgment. In both test procedures the subjects were asked to respond as if they were actually the teacher talking to the children portrayed on the film. Upon completion of each of the episodes, the subjects were asked to answer three questions: (1) What was it in this situation that made you, as the teacher, respond when you did? (2) Why did you say what you said or do what you did? and (3) What did you anticipate achieving, if anything, by the response you made? These questions were used to try and tap the rationale or reasoning for the particular response made. The protocols, which included responses to the filmed episodes and the answers to the three questions, from the two test procedures were compared in the following ways: (1) the number of words elicited by each method, (2) the point in the episode (time) at which the subject responded, (3) the degree of involvement in the response, (4) the homogeneity of content, and (5) the consistency between the rationale given for a response and the response itself. Analyses three, four and five involved placement of the protocols in category systems. Reliability of category classification was demonstrated by a measure of percent agreement between two sets of raters before the protocols were classified. The data were analyzed by the chi-square analysis and the t-test for related samples to determine the similarity of data elicited by the two administrative procedures. In general, the results of the analyses indicated that the two methods of test procedure, <b>individual</b> <b>oral</b> and group written, elicited comparable data to a classroom simulation test. On the basis of these results, several conclusions seem justified: 1. The group written procedure is economically superior to the <b>individual</b> <b>oral</b> procedure because of its tendency to elicit significantly shorter protocols and because it can be administered to more than one person at one time. 2. Both methods are similar in terms of the time of initiation of response. 3. The group written procedure and the <b>individual</b> <b>oral</b> procedure are similar in facilitating involvement in the simulator test. 4. Both methods are similar in terms of the nature of the content elicited. 5. Consistency between response and rationale for the response was independent of method of administration. The results of the present investigation cannot claim superiority for one method over the other, but it points to the equality of both. Additional research involving the use of simulation materials under various methodological conditions needs to be done in order to further explore the potential of this type of test stimuli...|$|R

Method: The sample consisted of 253 families and 324 adults, which corresponds to 16. 4 % of the families registered at the Jardim Santo Alberto FHU in Santo André, SP. The data of the families were collected using the Basic Attention Information System's A Form and transferred to the instrument "Family Risk Scoring System - Santo André", being classified as low, medium, high and extra high FSR. After this classification, all members of the families were asked to attend for an oral examination by the FHU's oral health team, being classified according to the caries and periodontal disease risk criteria established by the São Paulo State Health Secretary. Data were subjected to descriptive analysis, Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, and multiple logistic regressions. Results: The FSR was only associated with the microarea, and most individuals from the microarea 1 belonged to the high FSR classification. No significant association was found between caries risk and <b>individual</b> <b>oral</b> risk and the demographic variables. Women had 2. 290 more chances than men of presenting low risk of periodontal disease. Conclusion: The instrument and risk criteria used in this program should be restructured and reevaluated in other populations in order to achieve a more effective contribution for planning the work of FHU's oral health teams...|$|R
