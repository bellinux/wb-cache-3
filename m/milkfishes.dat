40|$|<b>Milkfish</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} farmed fish species in the Philippines. In the last 5 years, <b>milkfish</b> production has been increasing. Culture of <b>milkfish</b> in brackishwater ponds still contributes most to <b>milkfish</b> production, although production from marine cages has been on the rise, recently. To sustain <b>milkfish</b> production, a reliable supply of good quality seeds is imperative. Following the spontaneous spawning of <b>milkfish</b> in floating net cages in 1979, protocols for broodstock management, breeding and seed production were developed and these have been continuously refined over the years. Compared to Indonesia and Taiwan, however, commercialization of <b>milkfish</b> seed production in the Philippines, {{took a long time to}} take off. Currently, there are a number of government-run and private <b>milkfish</b> hatcheries in operation. In contrast, <b>milkfish</b> fingerling production in brackishwater ponds has long been practiced in the Philippines and is an industry in itself. Traditionally, <b>milkfish</b> fry were from catch from the wild. Recently, more and more come from local hatcheries as well as fry imported from neighboring countries like Indonesia and Taiwan.

40|$|A brief {{description}} is given of the <b>milkfish</b> (Chanos chanos) farming {{industry in the}} Philippines. Over the past 20 years, {{the relative importance of}} <b>milkfish</b> has declined with the expansion of tilapia, tiger shrimp and seaweed farming. In 1975, some 141, 461 mt of <b>milkfish</b> made up 10 % of the total fish production, whereas in 1995, the total <b>milkfish</b> harvest of 150, 858 mt made up only 5. 5 % of the total fish production. <b>Milkfish</b> are harvested and marketed mostly fresh or chilled, whole or deboned, but some are canned or smoked. The domestic markets, mainly in Metro Manila, absorb most of the production. <b>Milkfish</b> is also absorbed in different product forms: dried, canned, smoked, or marinated. An export market for quick-frozen deboned <b>milkfish</b> fillets has begun to develop and fish processing companies are responding fast.

Substantial {{progress}} {{had been made}} towards understanding the digestive physiology of <b>milkfish.</b> Major enzaymes envolved in the digestions of carbohydrates, protein and lipids had been detected in the pyloric caece, intestines and pancreas of <b>milkfish.</b> The most active carbohydrates {{were involved in the}} hydrolysis of Î± - glocosidic bonds. Intestinal amylase activity consistently reached the peak at about noon when <b>milkfish</b> gut was full. This confirms that <b>milkfish</b> is s daytime feeder. No cellulase activity was detected in any region orf the digertive treat although the fish relies heavily algae and other plant source for food.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to explain empirically the entire <b>milkfish</b> (Chanos chanos) industry in Taiwan, convering 1) the gathering {{and marketing of}} <b>milkfish</b> fry - the procurement subsystem; 2) the production of <b>milkfish</b> fingerlings for the baitfish industry; 3) the production of market-size <b>milkfish</b> - the transformation subsystem; and 4) the marketing of market-size <b>milkfish</b> - the delivery subsystem. A constant elasticity of substitution production function is used to estimate the input-output relationship for baitfish and market-size production systems, with all inputs classified into labor and capital.

40|$|Abstract only. <b>Milkfish</b> is an {{economically}} important fish cultured {{in many countries}} in Asia. In Thailand, <b>milkfish</b> culture has not been given much attention and has not as been developed as in the other Asian countries because {{in the past the}} farmers prefer to grow shrimps and other high value fishes. Nowadays, environmental changes and degradation can affect water resources as well as the important aquaculture species that thrive in them hence the Thai Department of Fisheries recognizes the importance of developing aquaculture that is environment-friendly. This includes <b>milkfish</b> in particular because <b>milkfish</b> meat tastes good, easy to manage on farm, grows rapidly and can be grown in sea water, brackish or even freshwater. <b>Milkfish</b> farming is a low cost operation because <b>milkfish</b> feed mainly on algae and organic matter and these are natural food produced from other types of aquaculture activities. <b>Milkfish</b> can therefore be co-cultured with other species and are capable of reducing the amount of organic material from the process of aquaculture before entering the environment. In 2002, <b>milkfish</b> was first bred successfully through hormone injection and later broodstock mated naturally in Thailand. At present, production of the 1 -inch <b>milkfish</b> has reached 1, 000, 000 per year. The culture sites are in the southern and eastern parts of the country, in brackish and salty areas. Culture methods are either monoculture or polyculture with other species such as shrimp, mussel etc. <b>Milkfish</b> culture in reservoirs last from 6 to 12 months when fish size is about 500 g or two pieces to a kg. and the price is about 50 baht/ kg. On the other hand, <b>milkfish</b> that are 600 - 1, 000 g can sell at 65 - 90 baht/kg. Apart from culture, processing as well as marketing promotion of <b>milkfish</b> has also started in Thailand. <b>Milkfish</b> processing training is being conducted at least 2 times a year. As for the marketing initiatives, there is a move for the <b>milkfish</b> to be declared the symbol of Prachuap Khiri Khan Province since it was here that the fish was first found naturally in Thailand. This, apart from the plan to promote <b>milkfish</b> in the festivals throughout the country. Although found promising, some problems in the Thai <b>milkfish</b> industry are also recognized. Such issues notwithstanding, the Thai Department of Fisheries is coming up with guidelines for <b>milkfish</b> aquaculture as it is optimistic that this commodity shall open the doors to a new alternative industry in Thailand...|$|R

Increasing <b>milkfish</b> production from aquaculture constitutes the strategies for securing fish food supply, especially for the growing middle- and low-income households. However, there are diverging analyses and criticisms on the effectiveness and performance of the <b>milkfish</b> industry in improving access to fish and protein sources among the poor in the Philippines. The generally increasing volumes of <b>milkfish</b> production due to improved technologies are indeed desirable. But higher levels of production does not guaranty the availability and access to fish food supply, especially in geographically dispersed production and consumption centers around the archipelago. Efficiency in marketing perishable fishery products is a crucial factor to ensure availability of safe and fresh <b>milkfish</b> in deficit areas.

There is, however, some disagreement over how these subjects and objects travel far and endure while staying the same. On the one hand, ‘consolidation’ suggests that heterogeneous materials should be consolidated into networks so that the integrity of assemblages remains while subjects and objects relocate. On the other hand, ‘fluidification’ suggests that fluid-like adaptation may be more feasible, although the integrity of subjects or objects may be at stake. The thesis investigates this tension between the two modes of assemblage via a historical and ethnographic study of <b>milkfish</b> farming in Taiwan and an examination of unsuccessful efforts to export them to mainland China. This study first explores the mutual formation of <b>milkfish</b> and <b>milkfish</b> farming and argues that not only are the physical characteristics of <b>milkfish</b> shaped alongside the socio-technical transformation of the <b>milkfish</b> assemblage, but the fish also act as an agent involved in the shaping of <b>milkfish</b> assemblage. Secondly, this study draws attention to how an industrial version of <b>milkfish</b> as a bulk commodity takes shape as well as how it is enacted so that it becomes the dominant reality for <b>milkfish.</b> It is argued that, paradoxically, this version of reality is maintained through fluidification, in which human actors compromise with enacted multiplicities of <b>milkfish.</b> Thirdly, this study turns to the <b>milkfish</b> export scheme. Set up {{under the auspices of the}} Chinese government in 2011, <b>milkfish</b> were exported to Shanghai. But <b>milkfish</b> failed to find a market in Shanghai, and so the export scheme was terminated in 2016. This study first reveals that the material characteristics of ‘ready-made’ <b>milkfish</b> are not easy to integrate into local ways of cooking and eating. Moreover, the fish are excluded from adaptation, while the scheme was adapted in practice to suit the requirements of various other actors brought together by the scheme. This thesis suggests that the lower the demand for <b>milkfish</b> in China, the higher is the need for such an export scheme in Taiwan, but that such a scheme will most likely take the form of continued ‘consolidation’, keeping the export of unsalable fish going while bringing minimal changes to the status quo of <b>milkfish</b> assemblage. Overall, this study of <b>milkfish</b> argues for the co-existence, in tension, of consolidation and fluidification. That is, neither mode of assemblage is in opposition to nor replaceable by the other. The implications for material politics of this study include not only a need to make visible the work of ‘purification’ that keeps both subjects and objects apparently separate from one another, and from others within each realm, but also a need to highlight efforts to erase other possible modes of assemblage, in which the formation of objects and of object-oriented collectives are embedded differently...|$|R

40|$|Juwana {{district}} {{is the largest}} producer of <b>Milkfish</b> production in Pati Regency. The high potential of <b>Milkfish</b> production in Juwana District had not been registered along {{with the number of}} <b>milkfish</b> processors, so that it causes an actual occurrence of value chain at a complete standstill. This research aims to analyse the commodity value chain so therefore will increase the productivity of <b>Milkfish</b> commodity in Juwana District, Pati Regency, Central Java. An analysis of the Value Chains Analysis is used as a method. The sample that used was quota sampling by the number 100 farmers as respondents and Snowballing method was applying for respondents, <b>Milkfish</b> processors, wholesale, and retail fishmongers in Porda market. The method for interview is about to ask the key person from academia, business, government, and community (A-B-G-C). The results showed that in the Commodity Value Chain of <b>Milkfish</b> refers to margin’ the fish farmers and wholesale fishmongers were 0 in Porda market. It was caused by the wholesale fishmongers acted as commissioners. Margin’ for fishmongers and the retailers were 1. 000, meanwhile margin for <b>Milkfish</b> processors and retail of fishmongers are 20. 000, therefore the significant number of increasing margin was caused by value added in the processing of Milkfis...|$|R
