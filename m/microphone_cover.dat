5000|$|In the UK, a 1000 Hz {{tone for}} 200 ms {{represents}} a 10p coin, and 1000 Hz for 350 ms represents a 50p coin. Prior to this system, the earliest UK pay-on-answer payphones used a resistance, {{inserted into the}} loop for one or several short periods followed by a short flash (complete disconnection), to signal units of money inserted. Phreaks simulated these signals by unscrewing the <b>microphone</b> <b>cover</b> of the handset and inserting into the microphone circuit a resistor in parallel with a press-to-open push-button, getting the timing correct was difficult and failure to do this {{would result in the}} relay set controlling the call at the exchange to release, dropping the call. This was hard to do inconspicuously in outdoor payphones, and was more common indoors (e.g., in student halls of residence). Manipulating a telephone in this way was obviously illegal and carried the specific offence of 'Abstracting Electricity' from the GPO (later the Post Office and later still BT.) ...|$|E
40|$|Morphological and {{positional}} {{factors that}} can affect the actual performance of the hearing-support (HS) devices are utilized to support the damaged hearing ability of the sensorineural hearing-impaired persons. However, {{there have been few}} studies that demonstrated the effects of variations in such design factors on the frequency response of the device experimentally. In this study, the effect of design variations {{in the shape of the}} <b>microphone</b> <b>cover</b> on the housing and the wearing position of the device mounted on the ear on the input frequency response of the device and on the performance of an embedded beamforming algorithm were investigated using a human upper body model, a hearing aid housing model, and an acoustic environment model using computer simulation. Experimental results showed that the implemented simulator could simulate the actual acoustic situations (differences less than 5 dB in audible frequency range) and that both of the response patterns of the device and beamforming algorithm were varied in accordance with the variations in the shape of the <b>microphone</b> <b>cover</b> and the mounting position of the device on the ear. These results demonstrate the necessity of additional design and algorithm fine-tuning of each (HS) device to improve its actual speech enhancement performance.

40|$|Tactile texture {{recognition}} {{seems to}} be a very important research area with various interesting applications which include medical, geological and more autonomous mobile robotics; despite the great amount of tasks that biological beings solve using the sense of touch, no much work is done in this area (except for pressure-related sensing), then, {{there are only a few}} papers in literature that uses dynamic tactile sensing strategies, i. e. the kind of exploration that we and the biological beings use to recognize a texture. In this paper we present a system for tactile texture recognition, using sound-understanding techniques. We develop a sensing "pen " with an electret piezoelectric <b>microphone,</b> <b>covered</b> by a rugged material, such pen is rubbed over the material that we want to iden*, the sound produced is segmented, the FFT is obtained and the result is introduced to a learning vector quantization technique (LVQ). We explore 18 common materials which includes surfaces from glass to a real human beard. We achieve more than 93 % of recognition over the 18 textures, and when the system makes an error it gives a similar texture as result...|$|R

40|$|A non-audible murmur (NAM), a {{very weak}} speech sound {{produced}} without vocal cord vibration, can be detected by a special NAM microphone attached to the neck, thereby providing a new speech communication tool for functional speech disorders as well as human-to-machine and human-to-human interfaces with inaudible voice input for use with unimpaired. The NAM microphone is a condenser <b>microphone</b> <b>covered</b> with soft-silicone impression material that provides good impedance matching with the soft tissues of the neck. Because higher-frequency components are suppressed severely, however, the NAM detected with this device can be insufficiently clear. To improve NAM clarity, the mechanism of NAM production {{as well as the}} transfer characteristics of the NAM in soft neck tissues must be clarified. We have investigated sound propagation from the vocal tract to the neck surface, using a finite difference time domain method and a head model based on magnetic resonance imaging scans. Numerical results show that, compared to air-conducted sound detected in front of a mouth, soft-tissue-conducted sound attenuates 50 dB at 1 kHz, which consists of 30 dB full-range attenuation due to air-to-soft-tissues transmission loss and - 10 dB/octave spectral decay due to a propagation loss in soft tissues. The decay agrees well with the spectral characteristics of the measured NAM...|$|R

40|$|Noise {{shielding}} benefits {{associated with}} an advanced unconventional subsonic transport concept, the Blended-Wing-Body, were studied using a 4 - percent scale, 3 -engine nacelle model. The {{study was conducted in}} the Anechoic Noise Research Facility at NASA Langley Research Center. A high- frequency, wideband point source was placed inside the nacelles of the center engine and one of the side engines in order to simulate broadband engine noise. The sound field of the model was measured with a rotating microphone array that was moved to various stations along the model axis and with a fixed array of microphones that was erected behind the model. Ten rotating microphones were traversed a total of 22 degrees in 2 -degree increments. Seven fixed <b>microphones</b> <b>covered</b> an arc that extended from a point in the exhaust exit plane of the center engine (and directly below its centerline) to a point 30 degrees above the jet centerline. While no attempt was made to simulate the noise emission characteristics of an aircraft engine, the model source was intended to radiate sound in a frequency range encompassing 1, 2, and 3 times the blade passage of a typical full-scale engine. In this study, the Blended-Wing-Body model was found to provide significant shielding of inlet noise. In particular, noise radiated downward into the forward sector was reduced by 20 to 25 dB overall in the full-scale frequencies from 2000 to 4000 Hz, decreasing to 10 dB or less at the lower frequencies. Also, it was observed that noise associated with the exhaust radiates into the sector directly below the model downstream to reduce shielding efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Wind {{noise was}} {{measured}} in four behind-the-ear hearing instruments with different microphone openings. A silent airflow of 7 m/s was directed toward the ear of a Kemar head and the resulting wind noise was measured. The amplification was set to an insertion gain of 35 dB at 1. 6 kHz. The wind noise amplitude at {{the position of the}} drum ranged from 84 to 97 dB(A). The hearing instrument with a partially <b>covered</b> <b>microphone</b> entrance proved best, whereas one with an open microphone entrance had the poorest performance. A reduction in wind noise of 6 - 17 dB could be achieved in all hearing instruments by using a simple windscreen made of Styrofoam. The windscreen affected the frequency response by less than 2 dB. By subtracting the insertion gain from the wind noise, an equivalent wind noise could be presented as a function of frequency. A considerable difference was found between the wind noise sensitivity in different hearing instruments. All could be improved by a windscreen without adversely affecting the frequency response...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the sound wave forms which correspond to auscultatory findings of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) clicking and crepitation. Such knowledge is important when selecting parts of digital recordings for spectral analysis. Electronic digital recordings were made with a sampling rate of 44 100 Hz from 60 subjects, including 51 patients referred for suspected rheumatological disease and nine healthy subjects. Accelerometers with the bandwidth 20 – 3600 Hz were used for all subjects and complementary recordings were made from a subgroup of nine subjects using a measurement microphone with the bandwidth 20 – 20 000 Hz. The clicking sounds could be classified into different types according to differences in temporal period duration (T) as measured on the analogue display. One type of clicking, found in 51 % of the patients, had a T of 2 – 20 ms. Another type, found in 70 % of the subjects, had a T of less than 1 ms, often as low 0. 2 ms. This type of clicking was not seen at all in the analogue display if the sampling rate was below 3 000 Hz. The character of the two types of clicking differed: the short duration sounds had a very high pitch, while the pitch of the longer duration sound was lower. Crepitation was found in 63 % of the subjects and was observed to be composed of a series of short duration sounds, occurring with brief (less than 10 ms) intervals. It is concluded that the accelerometer (or <b>microphone)</b> bandwidth should <b>cover</b> the entire audible range (20 – 20 000 Hz), and that sampling rates must be much higher than 3000 Hz, and preferably greater than 10 000 Hz, before the true significance of electronically recorded joint sounds/vibrations can be determined...|$|R
40|$|The pending {{retirement}} of the babyboom generation {{will put a}} strain on the elderly care support system. In particular, {{there will be a}} lack of qualified personnel to provide home care and also insufficient space in elderly care facilities. Technology integrated in the elderly’s home could help ease this burden. Firstly, this technology could keep an eye on things, reassuring the person's safety at home. In such a situation, the person can confidently live independently at home. This way the transfer to an elderly care facility can be postponed until a later stage in life. Secondly, the same technology could simultaneously gather various health-related information for the home caregivers to help diagnosing the elderly’s health situation. Furthermore, the daily gathering of this information makes it possible to track gradual changes over time which could otherwise be missed. This way the workload for both the home caregiver and the care facilities can be reduced. This topic will be addressed by developing and extending applications for a home monitoring system based on acoustic information gathered by microphones. Although many other sensors are also studied for home monitoring (camera, body-worn accelerometers, passive infrared sensor, etc.), acoustic information has some advantages over others: 1) Nowadays microphones are produced very cheaply. With prices for adequate microphones of a few euro per microphone, the total price for the home monitoring system can be limited. 2) The microphones {{do not have to be}} worn. This makes the system convenient for the user and limits its intrusion in his or her daily life. 3) Microphones do not depend on external lighting compared to cameras. Therefore the system’s performance will not suffer by bad lighting (at night, on a cloudy day, …). 4) Nowadays microphones are so small the system can be installed discretely in one’s home. 5) Some possible applications can only work on acoustic information, e. g. scream detection, assistive technology using speech recognition, etc. Furthermore, the system based on acoustic information can later be combined with e. g. cameras in a multi-sensor approach to achieve better performance. In this work a Wireless Acoustic Sensor Network (WASN) is used to gather the acoustic information. A WASN consists of multiple nodes equipped with one or more microphones and possibly a central processor. These nodes (and central processor) are wirelessly linked to exchange information. The use of multiple microphones has some advantages over a single microphone. Firstly, it allows the <b>microphones</b> to <b>cover</b> the whole room/house so that all possible acoustic sources have a microphone nearby for a qualitative observation of that source. Secondly, multiple recordings of the same acoustic source captured at different locations can be used to gather additional information about the source’s position and more noise reduction options are available. This doctoral research has made 2 main contributions to home monitoring systems based on acoustic information: (1) The design of a noise-robust footstep position detector. The detected footstep positions can be used to extract gait information which is known to be related to the person's health. For example, early stages of dementia or other cognitive impairment can be detected from the gait information. In this work standard sound source position estimation techniques are used, complimented by algorithms used to reduce the effect of the noise. It is shown that these complementary, noise-reducing, algorithms can reduce the absolute estimation error by 70 %. In addition it will be shown that some noise-reducing algorithms are influenced by the type of noise. It is clear that some of the noise-reducing algorithms will fail under non-stationary noise but, by using a selection of these noise-reducing algorithms an estimation error reduction of 33 % is still achieved. (2) Proposing a method to extract spatio-spectral features from multi-microphone data. These features can be used to extend existing activity detection applications. These applications try to detect current activities and are able to report abnormal, possibly alarming, situations. Typically activity detection applications use spectral features, describing how the observed signal sounds to a human listener. The proposed spatio-spectral features add an extra dimension to these, namely a spatial description of the sound (the origin of the observed sound). This way different activities can be better separated from their feature description. The proposed features are compared to the typical spectral features in 3 different experiments: a simulated sound source detection scenario, a real-life sound source detection scenario and a real-life activity detection scenario in the home of an older person. In almost all of the experiments the proposed features achieved a better detection score (up to 9. 4 % improvement), without ever achieving large disimprovements (at its worst 0. 2 % disimprovement). nrpages: 165 status: publishe...|$|R
