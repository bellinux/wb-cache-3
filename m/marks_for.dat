5|$|Goebbels, however, used {{not only}} {{intimidation}} but also cajoling and generosity {{to achieve his}} goals. Ferdinand Marian requested compensation of 50,000 <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> taking {{on the role of}} Süß, an amount double anything he had received for previous roles. When asked to approve this amount, Goebbels did so citing the importance of the film and the need for a high-caliber cast to ensure its success.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of Anachronox {{was long and}} difficult, originally planned for a third-quarter 1998 release. Tom Hall planned to create a sequel with the copious content removed during production. Critics enjoyed the game and awarded it high <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> its design and story. Ion Storm closed its Dallas offices {{one month after the}} game's release. In 2002, Anachronox cinematic director Jake Hughes spliced together gameplay footage and cutscenes to create a feature-length, award-winning machinima film.|$|E

Additionally, a suffix coming after the TAM marker can <b>mark</b> <b>for</b> the subject as well. In this way, subject marking is more flexible than <b>marking</b> <b>for</b> tense, aspect, and mood; however, subject pronouns cannot be used in conjunction with subject suffixes.|$|R
5|$|The game {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, who {{praised the}} enhanced vehicle physics, updated visuals, and strong sound design. Several reviewers also gave high <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> the game's Autovista mode. Some critics expressed frustration with Kinect features, and others {{also felt that}} the game was not enough of an innovation from its predecessor, Forza Motorsport 3. These critics did, however, concede that the game was a vast improvement over Forza Motorsport 3.|$|E
5|$|Entering {{his senior}} year, many scouts had Croyle ranked {{as high as}} the #2 quarterback in the country behind Joe Mauer, who would go on to play Major League Baseball. However, Croyle's high school career ended {{abruptly}} in the first game of his senior season against Glencoe High School after a hit by an opposing player tore Croyle's anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), causing him to miss the remainder of his senior year. When he graduated, he held the Alabama state records for career passing yards with 9,323, and career touchdowns with 105. He set <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> most passing yards in a single season, passing yards in a single game, touchdown passes in a season, and touchdown passes in a game.|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to punish}} Basarab, King Charles I mounted a {{military}} campaign {{against him in}} 1330. The king marched to Severin and took it from Basarab. The voivode asked for a truce, offering to refund 7,000 silver <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> {{the costs of the}} army, and showed himself ready to continue paying tribute to the king and send his son as a hostage to the royal court. But the king refused and advanced with his host into Wallachia where everything seemed to have been laid waste.|$|E
50|$|The {{total cost}} of the construction, {{including}} the relocation of railway lines but excluding work related to the elevation of Rendsburg station, was 13.4 million Mark.

5|$|John {{then went}} to France, {{although}} Philip II was annoyed at being excluded from the decision of Isabella's marriage. Matilda I, Countess of Nevers, Erard II of Chacenay, Albert, Abbot of Vauluisant and other local potentates asked John to intervene in their conflicts, indicating that he was esteemed in his homeland. John attended the funeral of Philip II at the Basilica of St Denis in July; Philip bequeathed more than 150,000 <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> the defence of the Holy Land. John then visited England, attempting to mediate a peace treaty between England and France after his return to France.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the coming}} years, several organisations, {{including}} the CIA and the West German Government, attempted to locate Bormann without success. In 1964, the West German government offered a reward of 100,000 Deutsche <b>Marks</b> <b>for</b> {{information leading to}} Bormann's capture. Sightings were reported at points all over the world, including Australia, Denmark, Italy, and South America. In his autobiography, Nazi intelligence officer Reinhard Gehlen claimed that Bormann had been a Soviet spy, {{and that he had}} escaped to Moscow. Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal believed that Bormann was living in South America. The West German government declared that its hunt for Bormann was over in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 {{banknote}} series was {{prepared by the}} Reserve Bank in October 2006 for the abandoned second phase of Operation Sunrise. The Chiremba Balancing Rocks was to be reinstated as the main feature on the obverse whilst use of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark continued. There were additional security features as opposed to previous issues, which included security threads, see-through register marks and recognition <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> the partially sighted.

5|$|Warenne offered King John 500 <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> licence {{to marry}} Melisent, {{the widow of}} Richard de Mountfichet, lord of the manor of Stansted in Essex. Warenne's only {{surviving}} child and sole-heiress was his daughter, Beatrice, whom he married to Doun Bardolf, the holder of a one-half moiety of the feudal barony of Shelford in Nottinghamshire. Beatrice married secondly Ralph, and thirdly Hubert de Burgh. Beatrice had a son, William Bardolf, by her first marriage, who became the eventual heir of his maternal grandfather. Bardolf's rights to the barony were controlled by Beatrice's third husband, who did not relinquish them {{until his death in}} 1243.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} August, 1916, Döblin {{was awarded}} the Fontane Prize (including a {{monetary}} award of 600 <b>Marks)</b> <b>for</b> The Three Leaps of Wang Lun (Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lun). Following this recognition, Döblin set himself {{to work on his}} historical novel Wallenstein, set during the Thirty Years' War. Döblin had to interrupt work on the novel in March 1917 because he had caught typhus, but was able to use the university library at Heidelberg during his convalescence in April and May to continue researching the Thirty Years' War. Back in Saargemünd he came into conflict with his superiors due to the poor treatment of the patients; on 2 August 1917 he was transferred to Hagenau (Haguenau) in Alsace, where the library of nearby Strassbourg helped complete Wallenstein by the beginning of 1919.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the final}} {{primaries}} on June 3, 2008, Obama had gained enough delegates {{to become the}} presumptive nominee. In a speech before her supporters on June 7, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama. By campaign's end, Clinton had won 1,640pledged delegates to Obama's 1,763; {{at the time of}} the clinching, Clinton had 286superdelegates to Obama's 395, with those numbers widening to 256 versus 438 once Obama was acknowledged the winner. Clinton and Obama each received over 17million votes during the nomination process with both breaking the previous record. Clinton was the first woman to run in the primary or caucus of every state and she eclipsed, by a very wide margin, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm's 1972 <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> most votes garnered and delegates won by a woman. Clinton gave a passionate speech supporting Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and campaigned frequently for him in fall 2008, which concluded with his victory over McCain in the general election on November 4. Clinton's campaign ended up severely in debt; she owed millions of dollars to outside vendors and wrote off the $13million that she lent it herself. The debt was eventually paid off by the beginning of 2013.|$|E
5|$|In 1994 {{the general}} {{design of the}} {{banknotes}} was reviewed {{to keep up with}} advancing technologies against counterfeiting, which resulted in the release of two new denominations ($50 and $100) between 1994 and 1995, also to counter the effects of consumer price inflation, which peaked at 41.6% in 1992. Although the Chiremba Balancing Rocks were retained, other features including latent imaging in which the letters RBZ can be seen when the banknote is tilted horizontally at the eye level and identification <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> the visually impaired were added to the design, and the neck of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark was longer. The $5, $10 and $20 banknotes were also revised with the new designs in 1997, whilst the $2 banknote was and replaced by a coin in the same year with the $5 denomination undergoing the same process in August 2001.|$|E
5|$|In February 1194 Coutances was in Germany, at {{the court}} of the German emperor, along with Longchamp, who brought letters to Richard, still in captivity. On 4 February, Coutances became a hostage to the German emperor as surety for the payment of the {{outstanding}} portion of Richard's ransom, and the king was released. The king never paid the final instalment of his ransom, and the archbishop had to pay 10,000 <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> his own release. From that point onwards Coutances was no longer involved with English politics or government, and {{spent the rest of}} his career on Norman affairs. His record of charter witnessing bears this out; between 1189 and 1194 Coutances was among the most prolific of the witnesses to the king's English charters, but not after 1194.|$|E

5|$|The two {{versions}} of Ernoul's chronicle tell different stories about John's ascent to the throne of Jerusalem. According to one version, the leading lords of Jerusalem sent envoys to France in 1208 asking Philip II to select a French nobleman as a husband for their queen Maria. Taking {{advantage of the opportunity}} to rid himself of John, Philip II suggested him. In the other version an unnamed knight encouraged the Jerusalemite lords to select John, who accepted their offer with Philip's consent. John visited Pope Innocent III in Rome. The pope donated 40,000 <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> the defence of the Holy Land, stipulating that John could spend the money only with the consent of the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem and the grand masters of the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller.|$|E
5|$|Walter Bellinger {{enjoyed the}} office of Ireland King of Arms from at least 1468. This is proven {{by the fact that}} on 3 June 1469, King Edward IV granted Bellinger a pension of £20 per annum for his service as Ireland. The same writ states that he had been {{appointed}} on 9 June the year before. Bellinger was a native of Dieppe, and had served as a herald for fifty-five years by 1477. He accompanied his King to France and acted as his ambassador to the French court in the discussions preceding the Treaty of Picquigny. The French King gave him the value of 100silver <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> his services in that affair. Bellinger held {{the office of}} Ireland King of Arms until the reign of Henry VII of England. After Bellinger, no one was appointed to fill the office.|$|E
5|$|William Peveril the Younger {{inherited}} his father's estates, but in 1155 {{they were}} confiscated by King HenryII. While in royal possession, Henry visited the castle in 1157, 1158, and 1164, {{the first time}} hosting King MalcolmIV of Scotland. During the Revolt of 1173–1174, the castle's garrison was increased from a porter and two watchmen to a force led by 20 knights shared with the castles of Bolsover and Nottingham. The Earls of Derby had a claim to the Peveril family's estates through marriage, and in 1199 William de Ferrers, the fourth earl, paid 2,000 <b>marks</b> <b>for</b> the Peak lordship, although the castle remained under royal control. The closest Peveril Castle came to seeing battle was in 1216, when King John gave the castle to William de Ferrers, but the castellan refused to relinquish control. Although they were both John's supporters, the king authorised the earl {{to use force to}} evict the castellan, who eventually capitulated, although {{there is no evidence that}} the castle was assaulted.|$|E
