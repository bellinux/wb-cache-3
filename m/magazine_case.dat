5000|$|Born in Buffalo, New York, on November 7, 1872, Frank Case {{worked as}} an usher at a {{vaudeville}} theater as a teen. In 1896, he started his hotel career as a night clerk at the Genesee Hotel in Buffalo. In a live appearance on the Royal Gelatine Hour radio show on June 17, 1937, Case told Rudy Valee that he learned his hotelier skills at the Genesee Hotel. There, he had to {{stay up all night}} by roaming the hotel on roller skates.Later, he managed Taylor's Hotel in Jersey City, New Jersey for three years. In 1902, at age 31, he was hired by Albert Foster to work at the new hotel at 59 W. 44th Street in Manhattan. Although Foster owned the hotel, Case embraced it as his own. He persuaded his boss to change the name of the hotel, from the [...] "Puritan" [...] to the [...] "Algonquin." [...] Twenty-five years later, he bought the business. In 1916, Mr. Case married Miss Bertha Walden. She was a charming, gracious, outstanding hostess, who fully participated in hotel operations. The Algonquin became a hub for both theater people and journalists, whose offices were nearby. In 1918, Vanity Fair magazine was four doors down. VF writers Robert E. Sherwood, Robert Benchley, and Dorothy Parker began lunching at the Algonquin. When the press reported that theater critic, Alexander Woollcott, was roasted at the Algonquin, customers increased. Mr. Case had a passion for the Arts, and encouraged, cultivated, and catered to the growing literary and artistic celebrities. Those attending these luncheons included Heywood Broun, Harold Ross, Edna Ferber, George S. Kaufman, Harpo Marx, and Franklin P. Adams (F.P.A.) among many others. Mr. Case moved this lively group to a round table {{in the center of the}} Rose room. Thus, began the Algonquin Round Table. He served them free hors d'oeuvres, provided a room for poker games, and space for journalists to hammer out stories. In 1925, Round tabler Harold Ross founded the New Yorker <b>magazine.</b> <b>Case</b> began the tradition of giving each hotel guest a free copy of The New Yorker. Frank Case died June 7, 1946 in Manhattan, New York and is buried in New York City's Woodlawn Cemetery.|$|E
