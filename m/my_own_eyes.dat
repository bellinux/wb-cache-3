So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes.</b> You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E

500|$|Threatened financially by Burroughs' condemnation, Long's {{publishers}} came {{to their}} client's defense by distributing a pamphlet defending his positions. In late 1903, Long published a new book titled A Little Brother to the Bear. In the preface, he wrote: [...] "Except where it is plainly stated otherwise, all the incidents and observations have passed under <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> and have been confirmed later by other observers... I have simply tried to make all these animals as interesting to the reader as they were to me when I discovered them." [...] While The New York Times reviewed it favorably, pointing out its [...] "close observation and loving attention {{to the details of}} wood life", Long's critics were quick to note a number of propositions regarding wildlife. An essay in the book titled [...] "Animal Surgery", in which Long wrote of various animals' ability to treat and mend their own injuries, particularly riled his critics. He told of how animals such as muskrat, beaver and bear were capable of intentionally bandaging their wounds and stumps of amputated limbs by coating them with materials such as tree resin or clay to keep the injury clean. The example that received the greatest attention was the story about a [...] "woodcock genius" [...] who set his own broken leg and applied a cast to the injury: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ode to Psyche" [...] is a 67-line poem {{written in}} stanzas of varying length, which took its form from {{modification}} Keats {{made to the}} sonnet structure. The ode is written to a Grecian mythological character, displaying a great influence of Classical culture as the poet begins his discourse with [...] "O GODDESS!" [...] (line 1). Psyche, a creature so beautiful that she drew the attention of Cupid himself, draws {{the attention of the}} narrator, whose artistic imagination causes him to dream of her: [...] "Surely I dream'd to-day, or did I see / The wingèd Psyche with awaken'd eyes" [...] (lines 5–6). As he relates himself to the mythical character of Cupid, he confuses the god's emotions with his own and imagines that he too has fallen in love with the woman's beauty. The poet does, however, understand the temporal difference between the characters of ancient Greece and his own as he declares, [...] "even in these days [...] I see, and sing, by <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> inspired" [...] (lines 40–43). In line 50, the poet states [...] "Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane", which, Harold Bloom suggests, implies that the poet himself becomes a [...] "prophet of the soul" [...] as he regards the beauty of Psyche and attempts to place himself within Cupid's personage. according to T.S. Eliot, it is the most prominent ode among the six great odes.|$|E

Cook, a US POW held in the Friedrichstadt marshaling yard the night before the attacks, later said that [...] "I saw with <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> that Dresden was an armed camp: thousands of German troops, tanks and artillery and miles of freight cars loaded with supplies supporting and transporting German logistics towards the east to meet the Russians".|$|E
2500|$|The {{accident}} ended Kahlo's {{dreams of}} becoming a doctor and caused her pain and illness {{for the rest of}} her life; her friend Andrés Henestrosa stated that Kahlo [...] "lived dying". During her recovery, she started to consider a career as a medical illustrator, which would combine her interests in science and art, and began to paint. She had a specially-made easel that enabled her to paint in bed, and a mirror was placed above it so she could see herself. [...] Painting became a way for Kahlo to explore questions of identity and existence, and she later stated that the accident and the isolating recovery period made her desire, [...] "to begin again, painting things just as I saw them with <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> and nothing more." ...|$|E

Sadly, the bitter truth is many, many times worse than anything you have heard. All that is known in the free world is but a drop in the ocean of massacres battering European Jewry. To all those doubters, I can bear witness from my own personal experience that all current descriptions are as nothing compared with the awful truth.

40|$|Twenty-five years ago, {{two great}} crises emerged: {{the crisis of}} the {{environment}} and {{the crisis of the}} individual. The environmental crisis was a visible one. I could see it with <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>eye,</b> and verify its existence from <b>my</b> <b>own</b> direct experience. The crisis of the individual was invisible; {{there was no way to}} prove its existence. There was always the possibility that it was no more than <b>my</b> <b>own</b> subjective feeling. And yet I was convinced that the individual was threatened by organize society, that my grandfather’s generation possessed an independence that was fast disappearing, that <b>my</b> <b>own</b> generation was being asked to give up too much individuality for the sake of a job or a career. The crisis of the individual is a product of the same modern organized social system that has provided many benefits. If the crisis becomes sufficiently severe, however, it can undermine all of those benefits, and there are signs that this is now happening. When the crisis of the natural environment becomes life-threatening, we pay attention. The crisis of the individual may be more life-threatening than we yet realize; the evidence of individual decay is all around us...|$|R
2500|$|The Baykalsk Pulp and Paper Mill was {{constructed}} in 1966, directly on the shoreline, bleaching paper with chlorine and discharging waste into Baikal. After decades of protest, the plant was closed in November 2008 due to unprofitability. In March 2009, the plant owner announced the paper mill would never reopen. On 4 January 2010, production was resumed. On 13 January 2010, Vladimir Putin introduced changes in the legislation legalising {{the operation of the}} mill, which brought about a wave of protests of ecologists and local residents. This was based on Putin's visual verification from a minisubmarine, [...] "I could see with <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> — and scientists can confirm — Baikal is in good condition and there is practically no pollution". In September 2013, the mill underwent a final bankruptcy, with the last 800 workers slated to lose their jobs by 28 December 2013. On 28 December 2013 the Russian Government decided to build a Russian Nature Reserves Expo Center on the place of the paper mill.|$|E
2500|$|Gonzaga {{dominated}} the art department of imperial theatres for over thirty years, surviving three monarchs: Catherine II, Paul I and Alexander I. He decorated coronations of Paul (1797), Alexander I (1801) and Nicholas I (1826) while his lifelong benefactor Yusupov administered all three events. Gonzaga became a trusted consultant to heiress and later empress Maria Fyodorovna, Golitsyn and Yusupov families and diversified into decorating palace interiors and landscape design. Fyodor Glinka described Gonzaga's three-dimensional trompe-l'œil folly in Pavlovsk Park (1815): [...] "What {{is a reality}} and what is a dream? ... Convinced at the existence of what was before me, I kept going further and further forward. But suddenly something strange began to happen to my eyes: {{it was as if}} an invisible curtain of some sort was descending upon these objects and swallowing them from sight ...

2500|$|According to Matei Călinescu, Paul Georgescu made special {{efforts to}} push Marxist-Leninist rhetoric and {{conclusions}} into {{the texts of}} non-communist authors he reviewed for publishing, in particular those of philosopher and critic Tudor Vianu. In his recollections, first published in 1998, Călinescu wrote: [...] "In 1957-1958, [...] I could see with <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> how the magazine's editor in chief, Paul Georgescu, was in the printing house, adding the political clichés and the daily slogans into the galley proofs of Tudor Vianu's weekly articles." [...] Călinescu focuses on one such instance, when Georgescu was reportedly so angered by a Vianu text on Renaissance humanism (lacking the obligatory mention of Marxist humanism), that he called him [...] "bourgeois pig" [...] and modified the piece to contain [...] "five or six ritualistic expressions in the wooden tongue". Constantin Ţoiu also recalled that his own relationship with Georgescu cooled when the latter discovered that Ţoiu was frequenting banned author Ion Negoiţescu—this, Ţoiu claimed, explains why {{he was no longer}} given permission to publish in Gazeta Literară. Georgescu took a personal part in condemning and marginalizing Negoiţescu (who was ultimately arrested in 1961), describing him as a [...] "reactionary" [...] author who had failed in adopting [...] "the judicious attitude".|$|E
2500|$|Due in part {{to public}} discontent and {{in part to}} a {{campaign}} for re-examination by Vette himself, a Royal Commission of Inquiry was formed on 7 July 1980 to examine the TAIC's finding of pilot error. Vette's research, along with other evidence, was presented to High Court Judge Peter Mahon, {{who was in charge of}} the commission. Vette served as an adviser to Mahon during the proceedings, and his findings proved especially influential. Justice Mahon even took a helicopter ride to Mt. Erebus during the course of his investigation to experience the phenomenon of sector whiteout for himself. As he later described it, [...] "I was taken for a flight myself in white out conditions and saw with <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> the flat terrain of ice and snow stretching forth for more than forty miles when in fact right in front of us there was a snow ridge several hundred feet high". Mahon's final report was published on 27 April 1981, and it largely agreed with Vette's hypotheses. Mahon found Air New Zealand to be financially responsible, describing their attempts to shift the blame on to the late flight crew as [...] "very clearly part of an attempt to conceal a series of disastrous administrative blunders". ANZ appealed the ruling to the New Zealand Court of Appeal, and, although the financial penalties were ultimately removed, the court declined to overturn any of Mahon's factual findings.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{critics have}} argued that Smart's work {{comments}} on modern urban alienation, a post-industrial landscape that has fallen from human control. Others have cast him as a realist, hyper-realist, 'off-beat classicalist' and a metaphysical painter. Some critics have even referred to Smart's paintings as portraying 'Orwellian gloom' – a statement referring, in particular, to George Orwell's literary political masterpiece, Nineteen Eighty-Four. James Gleeson believes that Smart's paintings are [...] "too real to be real"; and believes that his realist portrayals of 20th century life {{are nothing more than}} superb geometrical compositions and bold colour, of man in his naturalistic, man-made environment. It is true, for instance, that trees are rarely seen in Jeffrey Smart's artworks, and the only grass is that growing between concrete stones, but as Smart claimed: [...] "an artist has to be moved to move his viewers", and Smart was moved by man in nature – man-made nature – not concerned with your typical Australian landscape. [...] "I like living in the 20th century – to me the world has never been more beautiful. I am trying to paint the real world I live in, as beautifully as I can with <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes...</b> It's obvious a bunch of flowers or a billabong is beautiful, and I love natural beauty, but I am not moved by it.... to me composition is everything".
