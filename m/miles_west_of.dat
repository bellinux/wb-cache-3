5|$|The Touchet Formation is {{also found}} in Oregon, in areas flooded by Lake Condon. This lake back-flooded into the Umatilla and John Day River Valleys as well as other tributaries. As one example, silt-sand rhythmites {{associated}} with the Missoula Floods are present along Willow Creek, a valley tributary to the Columbia River. Willow Creek conflues with the Columbia a few <b>miles</b> <b>west</b> <b>of</b> Boardman, Oregon. Excellent exposures of the unit (which contains abundant clastic dikes) can be found in roadcuts along Hwy 74 (Heppner Highway) near the ranching community of Cecil, Oregon. These deposits are associated with former Lake Condon.|$|E
5|$|At Devil's Gate {{the rescue}} party {{unloaded}} the baggage {{carried in the}} wagons of the Hodgett and Hunt wagon companies that had been following the Martin Company so the wagons {{could be used to}} transport the weakest emigrants. A small group led by Daniel Webster Jones remained at Devil's Gate over the winter to protect the property. On November 4 the company had to cross the Sweetwater River, which was about 2 feet (0.6 m) deep and 90 to 120 feet (27 to 37 m) wide. The stream was clogged with floating ice. Some of the men of the rescue party spent hours pulling the carts and carrying many of the emigrants across the river. However, many members of the company crossed the river themselves, some even pulling their own handcarts across. The severe weather forced the Martin Company to halt for another five days at Martin's Cove, a few <b>miles</b> <b>west</b> <b>of</b> Devil's Gate.|$|E

5|$|However, when Edward's army {{approached}} and camped at Badbury Rings, an Iron Age hill fort four <b>miles</b> <b>west</b> <b>of</b> Wimborne, Æthelwold {{was unable to}} gain sufficient support to meet them in battle. Leaving behind his consort, he fled to the Danes of Northumbria, who accepted him as king. Northumbrian coins were issued {{at this time in}} the name of a king called 'Alwaldus', who is thought to have been Æthelwold. Norse sagas record traditions of a Danish king Knútr, who briefly ruled Northumbria around 900. He is said to have been at first repulsed by an English king called Adalbrigt north of Cleveland, but then to have defeated him at Scarborough. In 1987, Smyth suggested that Adalbrigt could have been Æthelwold, but in 1995 Smyth put forward the alternative idea that the Northumbrian Danes accepted Æthelwold's claim to be king of the West Saxons rather than taking him as their own king.|$|E
5|$|On June 12, Egyptian {{infantry}} numbering {{at about}} 4,000, {{reinforced by the}} republican army and mercenaries from the Aden protectorate invaded the town of Beit Adaqah, about thirty <b>miles</b> <b>west</b> <b>of</b> San'a, where Prince Abdullah held a front extending from the Hodeida road, through Kawakaban province, to southern Hajjah. In two days, the attackers advanced about twelve miles, before being repelled by a counter-attack. The royalists admitted about 250 casualties. Next, the Egyptians attacked Sudah, about 100 miles north-west of San'a. They used the unpopularity of the local royalist commander to bribe several local sheiks and occupied the town unopposed. After a month, the sheiks sent delegations to al-Badr soliciting pardons and asking for guns and money with which to fight the Egyptians. Al-Badr sent new forces and managed to regain the surroundings of Sudah, though not the town itself.|$|E
5|$|On September26, a {{very large}} extratropical area of low {{pressure}} developed along a quasi-stationary frontal system a few hundred <b>miles</b> <b>west</b> <b>of</b> the Azores. The low intensified into the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 80mph (130km/h) at 12:00UTC on September27. Over the following days, the low began to lose its frontal features and began to transition into a subtropical cyclone as it traveled in a general westward direction. By September29, the low had developed sufficient convection and was declared Subtropical Storm Laura. Upon being upgraded, cold cloud tops began to wrap around the center of Laura and consolidate near the center of circulation. The convection organized around the center quickly and a satellite pass over the storm revealed that it could be intensifying. A later satellite pass disregarded the possibility of intensification as the intensity was confirmed to be at 60mph (95km/h). The overall structure of Laura remained subtropical but there were indications that it was acquiring tropical characteristics.|$|E
