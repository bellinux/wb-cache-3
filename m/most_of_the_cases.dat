The most common problem is insufficiency of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or luteinizing hormone (LH) leading to sex hormone abnormalities.

25|$|An unusual {{effect of}} the Northridge {{earthquake}} was an outbreak of coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever) in Ventura County.

The United States Department of Agriculture viewed <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> and found no violations of animal-welfare regulations.

Fearful of extremist violence and revolution, the American public supported the raids. Civil libertarians, the radical left, and legal scholars raised protests. Officials at the Department of Labor, especially Post, asserted {{the rule of law}} in opposition to Palmer's anti-radical campaign. Post faced a Congressional threat to impeach or censure him. He successfully defended his actions in two days of testimony before the House Rules Committee in June 1919 and no action was ever taken against him. Palmer testified before the same committee, also for two days, and stood by the raids, arrests, and deportation program. Much of the press applauded Post's work at Labor, while Palmer, rather than President Wilson, was largely blamed for the negative aspects of the raids.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a curious}} fact that amaurotic family idiocy, a rare and fatal disease of children, occurs mostly among Jews. The largest number of cases has been {{observed}} in the United States—over thirty in number. It was at first {{thought that this was}} an exclusively Jewish disease because <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> at first reported were between Russian and Polish Jews; but recently there have been reported cases occurring in non-Jewish children. The chief characteristics of the disease are progressive mental and physical enfeeblement; weakness and paralysis of all the extremities; and marasmus, associated with symmetrical changes in the macula lutea. On investigation of the reported cases, they found that neither consanguinity nor syphilitic, alcoholic, or nervous antecedents in the family history are factors in the etiology of the disease. No preventive measures have as yet been discovered, and no treatment has been of benefit, all the cases having terminated fatally.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{reports of}} {{atypical}} flu in two individuals in southern California {{led to the}} discovery of the novel swine flu virus by the CDC in mid-April. More than a hundred cases were confirmed in the next two weeks, spread through a dozen states. Outside of California and Texas, initial cases were all tied to recent travel to Mexico or close contact with those who had recently visited Mexico. St. Francis Preparatory School, a private school in New York, was the center of a large cluster of cases after a Spring Break trip by several students, and perforce one of the first U.S. schools to be closed as a public health measure during the early outbreak. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> in California and Texas are not linked and may reflect localized outbreaks of this virus in those areas. As of April 30, the disease was not as virulent outside of Mexico as within Mexico, for reasons not fully understood.|$|E
25|$|Concerning the {{practice}} of psalm recitation, the recitation by a congregation of educated chanters is already testified by the soloistic recitation of abridged psalms {{by the end of}} the 4th century. Later it was called prokeimenon. Hence, there was an early practice of simple psalmody, which was used for the recitation of canticles and the psalter, and usually Byzantine psalters have the 15 canticles in an appendix, but the simple psalmody itself was not notated before the 13th century, in dialogue or papadikai treatises preceding the book sticheraria. Later books, like the akolouthiai and some psaltika, also contain the elaborated psalmody, when a protopsaltes recited just one or two psalm verses. Between the recited psalms and canticles troparia were recited according to the same more or less elaborated psalmody. This context relates antiphonal chant genres including antiphona (kind of introits), trisagion and its substitutes, prokeimenon, allelouiarion, the later cherubikon and its substitutes, the koinonikon cycles as they were created during the 9th century. In <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> they were simply troparia and their repetitions or segments were given by the antiphonon, whether it was sung or not, its three sections of the psalmodic recitation were separated by the troparion.|$|E

25|$|The CNDH {{suggested}} after Bermúdez Zacarías' {{murder to}} create a policy to have judges handle cases anonymously {{in order to protect}} their identity. They argued that by having this policy in place, judges would be able to preside over cases impartially and without being intimidated. This method was used in Peru, Colombia, and Italy to protect judges who faced threats from armed groups. The Mexican government stated that they would debate and consider the proposal as an option, but said that accepting the policy would mean that they were giving in to the pressures from organized crime. Moreover, the 2016 judicial reform – the New Criminal Justice System (Spanish: Nuevo Sistema de Justicia Penal, NSJP) – advocated for greater judicial transparency, a move that was seen at odds with the proposed policy. When Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered, only 70 out of 1,391 federal judges had security measures in place to protect them from attacks. Several judges advocated for more security measures, but this also posed several challenges because of the limited resources and long processes that would need to take place for such budgets to be approved by politicians. Local judges, however, do not enjoy the level of protection that their federal counterparts have, and attacks from organized crime members are more prevalent. In addition, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> involving attacks or intimidation against judges are not reported to the police. If the cases are filed to the police, many of them do not reach a court of law and are closed without imparting justice.|$|E
