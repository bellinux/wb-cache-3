Based on the freely available ”ipmitool” program, we built a framework which allows to communicate with AMC Module <b>Management</b> <b>Controllers</b> through the Shelf Manager's network interface, without need to tap an IPMB. It contains functions to exercise various IPMI transactions and to check integrity and correctness of FRU (Field Replacable Unit) information and other data structures published by <b>Management</b> <b>Controllers.</b> The general structure of the library will be presented, as well as first results and future plans...|$|R

25|$|On {{the stock}} Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), {{as well as}} on most 8-bit arcade hardware, {{platform}} games generally only scroll in one direction at a time, usually horizontally. This means designers must use a very narrow level progression, or break levels up into subareas that scrolled either horizontally or vertically, {{as was the case in}} Metroid and Mega Man — or effectively upgrade the system using memory <b>management</b> <b>controller</b> chips, embedded into each relevant cartridge. One of the first platform games to scroll in all four directions freely and follow the on-screen character's movement is in a vector game called Major Havoc, which comprises a number of mini-games, including a simple platformer, a shoot 'em up sequence, a landing sequence, and a Breakout clone. One of the first raster-based platform games to scroll fluidly in all directions in this manner is the previously mentioned 1984 classic, Legend of Kage.|$|E
500|$|Describing the game's soundtrack as a [...] "compilation of game music", Kageyama {{said that}} making {{it was a}} test in trying to [...] "take what people {{generally}} considered to be the sound of the Famicom, and kick it up a notch." [...] Naohisa Morota handled the sound programming, and Kageyama described his contributions as [...] "profound" [...] and helpful in one of his goals in making the tracks sound more like a live performance than just compositions. The Famicom version uses a variation of Sunsoft's FME-7 memory <b>management</b> <b>controller</b> known as [...] "SUNSOFT 5B", which, in addition to the functionality provided by the stock FME-7, features a Yamaha YM2149 PSG audio chip to provide three additional channels for music and sound. Since the NES only uses five sound channels, the extra sound channels were excluded from the European release.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} graphics {{were created}} {{with a special}} graphics machine ("Character Generator Computer Aided Design") that generated a collection of all the graphical shapes used in the game. Shapes in the collection were assigned numbers that the game's code uses to access, and are combined to form complete images on the screen in real time. The Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge uses Nintendo's custom MMC3 (memory <b>management</b> <b>controller)</b> ASIC to enhance the NES capabilities. [...] The MMC3 chip allows for animated tiles, extra RAM for diagonal scrolling, and a scan line timer to split the screen. The game uses these functions to split the game screen into two portions, a playfield {{on the top and}} a status bar on the bottom, allowing the top portion to scroll as the character navigates the stage while the bottom portion remains static to display text and other information.|$|E

500|$|In February 1986, Nintendo {{released}} {{the game as}} the launch title for the Family Computer's new Disk System peripheral. The Legend of Zelda was joined by a re-release of Super Mario Bros., Tennis, Baseball, Golf, Soccer, and Mahjong in its introduction of the Disk System. It made full use of the Disk Card media's advantages over traditional ROM cartridges with a disk size of 128 kilobytes, which was expensive to produce on cartridge format. Due to the still-limited amount of space on the disk, however, all the text was only in katakana. Rather than passwords, it used rewritable disks to save the game. It used the extra sound channel provided by the Disk System for certain sound effects; most notable are the sounds of Link's sword when his health is full, the roars and growls of dungeon bosses, and enemy death sounds. The sound effects used the Famicom's PCM channel in the cartridge version. It also used the microphone built into the Famicom's controller that {{was not included in}} the NES. This led to confusion in the U.S. as the instruction manual reads that Pols Voice, a rabbit-like enemy in the game, [...] "hates loud noise". Blowing or shouting into the Famicom's microphone kills these creatures. However, they cannot be killed through use of the recorder, and on the NES must be killed with weapons. The cartridge version made use of the Memory <b>Management</b> <b>Controller</b> chip, specifically the MMC1 model. The MMC could use bank-switching, allowing larger games than had been previously possible. They also allowed for battery-powered RAM, which let players save progress for the first time on any cartridge-based system or game.|$|E

Developers can add these chips to their games, such as the Konami VRC6, Konami VRC7, Sunsoft 5B, Namco 163, and two more by Nintendo itself: the Nintendo FDS wave generator (a modified Ricoh RP2C33 chip [...] with single-cycle wave table-lookup sound support), and the Nintendo Memory <b>Management</b> <b>Controller</b> 5 (MMC5).|$|E

50|$|A {{key feature}} of the HPI {{specification}} {{is the way it}} handles dynamic reconfiguration, or hot-swap actions in the managed platform.

Often, especially in system architectures like AdvancedTCA, FRUs include their own platform <b>management</b> <b>controllers.</b> Thus, hot-swapping a FRU can simultaneously modify both the set of hardware Entities to be managed and the infrastructure available for that management.|$|R
