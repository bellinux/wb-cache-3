5|$|While many Manhattan {{scientists}} {{expected that}} the development of the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> of the atomic bomb would be straightforward, Parsons, with his experience of the proximity fuze program, expected that it would involve considerable effort. The test program was initiated on 13 August 1943 at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia, where a scale model of the Fat Man plutonium bomb was developed. On 3 March 1944, testing moved to Muroc Army Air Field, California. The initial tests demonstrated that the Fat Man assembly was unstable in flight, and that its fuzes did not work properly.|$|E

25|$|The Solifugae {{apparently}} have neither venom glands nor any venom-delivery apparatus {{such as the}} fangs of spiders, stings of wasps, or venomous setae of caterpillars (e.g., Lonomia or Acharia species). One 1978 study is frequently quoted, in which the authors report detection of an exception to this rule in India, in that Rhagodes nigrocinctus had venom glands, and that injection of the secretion into mice was frequently fatal. However, no supporting studies have confirmed either {{the facts of the}} matter, such as by independent detection of the glands as claimed, or the relevance of the observations if correct. Even the authors of the original account denied having found any <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> of the putative venom by the animal, and the only means of administering the material to the mice was by parenteral injection. Given that many non-venoms such as saliva, blood and glandular secretions can be lethal if injected, and that no venomous function was even speculated upon in this study, there is no evidence as yet for even one venomous species of solifugid.|$|E

2500|$|The {{standard}} <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> was a 10 metre long cattle freight wagon, although {{third class}} passenger carriages {{were also used}} when the SS wanted {{to keep up the}} [...] "resettlement to work in the East" [...] myth, particularly in the Netherlands and in Belgium. The SS manual covered such trains, suggesting a carrying capacity per each trainset of 2,500 people in 50 cars, each boxcar loaded with 50 prisoners. In reality however, boxcars were crammed with up to 100 persons and routinely loaded from the minimum of 150% to 200% capacity. This resulted in an average of 5,000 people per trainset; 100 persons in each freight car multiplied by 50 cars. Notably, during the mass deportation of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka in 1942 trains carried up to 7,000 victims each.|$|E
2500|$|In Europe, {{the bicycle}} {{had fallen out}} of favour as a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> {{in the third quarter of}} the 20th century.

[...] London's [...] "On Yer Bike" [...] and [...] "Pedal-Pushers" [...] were pioneers of pedal over petrol, and the rest of the city's courier companies followed suit. [...] By the late 1980s, cycle couriers were a common sight in central London and a British manufacturer named a range of mountain-bikes for them, the Muddy Fox 'Courier'. [...] Entrepreneurs in continental Europe, some inspired by seeing couriers in the U.S. or in London, began to offer bicycle courier services in the late 1980s, and by 1993 there were sufficiently large numbers of bicycle couriers in Northern Europe and North America that over 400 attended the inaugural Cycle Messenger Championships in Berlin, Germany. [...] Bicycle messengers have not become common in southern Europe, the heartland of world competitive cycling. There are very few bicycle couriers in Portugal, France, Spain, or Italy. Outside Europe and North America, there are now large bicycle messenger services in Japan, and also in New Zealand and Australia. More recently, several companies started offering bike messenger services in Central and South America, specifically in México City, México; San José, Costa Rica; Bogotá, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.|$|E
