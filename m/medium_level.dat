5|$|Following {{the initial}} {{phase of the}} war, the GR1s {{switched}} to <b>medium</b> <b>level</b> strike missions, typical targets for these strikes included munition depots and oil refining facilities. Only the reconnaissance Tornado GR1As continued to operate at the low-altitude high-speed profile throughout the war, the GR1A emerged unscathed despite the inherent danger posed by missions such as conducting pre-attack reconnaissance. In the war's aftermath, Britain maintained a {{military presence in the}} Gulf, around half a dozen GR1s were based at Ali Al Salem airbase in Kuwait for operations over the southern no fly zone as part of Operation Southern Watch; another half a dozen GR1s participated in missions over Northern Iraq in Operation Provide Comfort.|$|E
5|$|Being {{designed}} for low-level operations, the Tornado required modification {{to perform in}} <b>medium</b> <b>level</b> operations that the RAF adopted in the 1990s. The RAF's GR1 fleet was extensively re-manufactured as Tornado GR4s. Upgrades on Tornado GR4s included a Forward looking infrared, a wide-angle HUD (Head-up display), improved cockpit displays, NVG (Night vision devices) capabilities, new avionics, and a Global Positioning System receiver. The upgrade eased the integration of new weapons and sensors which were purchased in parallel, including the Storm Shadow cruise missile, the Brimstone anti-tank missile, Paveway III laser-guided bombs and the RAPTOR reconnaissance pod was integrated. The first flight of a Tornado GR4 was on 4 April 1997, on 31 October 1997 the RAF accepted the first delivery and deliveries were completed in 2003. In 2005, the RSAF opted to have their Tornado IDSs undergo a series of upgrades to become equivalent to the RAF's GR4 configuration. On 21 December 2007 BAE signed a £210m contract for CUSP, the Capability Upgrade Strategy (Pilot). This project would see RAF GR4/4A improved in two phases, starting with {{the integration of the}} Paveway IV bomb and a communications upgrade, followed by a new tactical datalink in Phase B.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study consumers’ {{acceptance}} of pork with different levels of boar taint, in Barcelona (ES, n= 126) and Reading (UK, n= 146). Samples were classified as ‘Females’, ‘Low boar taint’ (low levels of androstenone and skatole), and ‘Medium boar taint’ (<b>medium</b> <b>levels</b> of androstenone and skatole). Three segments of consumers were identified {{on the basis of}} ‘How delicious do you find this meat’. The first segment was labelled as ‘pork lovers’ (n= 169), the second as ‘boar meat lovers’ (n= 59) and the third one as ‘gilt meat lovers’ (n= 44). Apart from the ‘pork lovers’, this study identified a group of consumers that scored better the meat with <b>medium</b> <b>levels</b> of boar taint than low levels or meat from gilts, suggesting that there is a niche for meat from <b>medium</b> <b>levels</b> of boar taintPostprint (published version...|$|R

2500|$|Italian winemakers {{have had}} a long history of using Slavonian oak from the Quercus robur which is known for its tight grain, low {{aromatics}} and <b>medium</b> <b>level</b> tannins. Slavonian oak tends to be used in larger barrel sizes (with less surface area relative to volume) with the same barrels reused for many more years before replacement. [...] Prior to the Russian Revolution, Quercus petraea oak from the Baltic/European states especially from Hungary was the most highly sought after wood for French winemaking. The trees in the Hungarian Zemplén Mountains grow slower in the volcanic soil and smaller, creating fine tight grain which sequentially lends itself to a very delicate extraction.|$|E

2500|$|The 53d WRS was {{activated}} in 1944 at Presque Isle Army Air Field, Maine, originally as the 3 WRS. Many of its missions {{were flown}} from a forward base at Gander, Newfoundland, using B-25s. Its original {{mission was to}} fly weather tracks along aircraft ferry routes between North America and Allied Western Europe. During the 1946 season, when the 53d WRS acquired the Boeing RB-29 (later WB-29) Superfortress as its primary aircraft, the term [...] "Hurricane Hunters" [...] was first used to describe its missions. While not an ideal weather reconnaissance platform, the WB-29 proved to be comparatively safe and reliable. The first <b>medium</b> <b>level</b> penetration of a hurricane took place on 19 October 1947 by an RB-29 of the 53d WRS into Hurricane Love near Bermuda, validating penetration of tropical storms at lower altitudes as reasonably safe.|$|E
2500|$|Three Bombardment Groups were {{allocated}} {{to support the}} Allied invasion of French North Africa in November 1942. They were initially used to carry out low-level attacks against heavily defended targets, incurring heavy losses with poor results, before switching to <b>medium</b> <b>level</b> attacks. By {{the end of the}} North African Campaign, the three B-26 groups had flown 1,587 sorties, losing 80 aircraft. This was double the loss rate of the B-25, which also flew 70% more sorties with fewer aircraft. Despite this, the B-26 continued in service with the Twelfth Air Force, supporting the Allied advance through Sicily, Italy and southern France. Air Marshal Sir John Slessor, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Allied Air Forces, wrote of [...] "the astonishing accuracy of the experienced medium bomber groups -- particularly the Marauders; I think that the 42nd Bombardment Group in Sardinia is probably the best day-bomber unit in the world." [...] Slessor in fact meant the 42nd Bomb Wing—17th, 319th and 320th Bomb Groups—but a US 'wing' equated roughly to a British 'group', and vice versa.|$|E

5000|$|Medium-phosphorus {{electroless}} nickel(MPEN) {{is referred}} to the nickel-phosphorus alloy deposited by electroless/autocatalytic {{process in which the}} resulting alloy consists of <b>medium</b> <b>levels</b> of phosphorus; the definition of <b>medium</b> <b>levels</b> is different in sources of different branches of technology(decorative, industrial, ...). the range accepted as <b>medium</b> <b>levels</b> can be (percent by weight) 4-7 (decorative purpose), 6-9 (industrial sources), or 4-10 (Electronic applications). The EN bath is typically composed of (a.) Nickel source sulfate , (b.) Reducing agent hypophosphite, (c.) Complexing agent; which are necessary to increase phosphite solubility and also to slow down the reaction speed in order to prevent the white-out phenomena but are not co-deposited into the resulting alloy acids or amines, (d.) Stabilizers; which slow down the reduction by co-deposition with the nickel or sulphur or organics, (e.)Buffers complexing agents perform double duty as buffers, (f.) Brighteners; mostly co-deposited with nickel and usually can double as stabilizers or certain organics, (g.) Surfactants; which reduce surface tension in order reduce pitting and staining or almost any other surfactant and (h.) Accelerators; which are added overcome the slow plating rate imparted by complexing agents and usually are co-deposited and can cause discoloration of the deposit compounds. Medium-phosphorus treatment has a high-speed deposit rate and offers bright and semi-bright options for cosmetic particularization. The processing is very stable, used often for Slurry Disposal Industries. This is {{the most common type of}} electroless nickel applied.|$|R
30|$|An {{analysis}} of the community level identified two distinct clusters, one including dominant/canopy species with the highest growth rates and a greater variation of growth, and another cluster which includes the remaining subcanopy species which have a smaller maximum size and lower rates of growth. The area-based structure variables on plot level have a highly significant effect on total basal area growth. However, the effects of forest density and species richness on productivity were not straight forward. Maximum basal area production of about 0.75  m 2 /ha/year is achieved at <b>medium</b> <b>levels</b> of richness (around 20 species per ha) and <b>medium</b> <b>levels</b> of density (around 30  m 2 /ha basal area) using percentile regression estimates. The relative “Dominance” of a selected reference tree had a highly significant effect on individual tree growth on all investigated species. Other neighbourhood structure variables were only occasionally significant or not significant at all.|$|R
