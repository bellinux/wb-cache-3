40|$|A large {{contribution}} to {{the total cost of}} energy in offshore wind farms is due to maintenance costs. In recent years research has focused therefore on lowering the maintenance costs using different approaches. Decision support models for scheduling the maintenance exist already, dealing with different factors influencing the scheduling. Our contribution deals with the uncertainty in the repair <b>times.</b> Given the <b>mean</b> repair <b>times</b> for different turbine components we make some assumptions regarding the underlying repair time distribution. We compare the results of a decision support model for the <b>mean</b> <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> and those repair time distributions. Additionally, distributions with the same mean but different variances are compared under the same conditions. The value of lowering the uncertainty in the repair time is calculated and we find that using distributions significantly decreases the availability, when scheduling maintenance for multiple turbines in a wind park. Having detailed information about the repair time distribution may influence the results of maintenance modeling and might help identify cost factors...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{production lines}} {{consisting of a}} series of machines separated by finite buffers. The processing time of each machine is deterministic and all the machines have the same processing time. All machines are subject to failures. As is usually the case for production systems we assume that the failures are operation-dependent (Buzacott and Hanifin 1978, Dallery and Gershwin 1992). Moreover, we assume that the <b>times</b> <b>to</b> failure and the <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> are exponentially distributed. To analyze such systems, a decomposition method was proposed by Gershwin (1987). The computational efficiency of this method was later significantly improved by the introduction of the so-called DDX algorithm (Dallery et al. 1988, 1989). In general, this method provides fairly accurate results. There are however cases for which the accuracy of this decomposition method may not be so good. This is the case when the reliability parameters (<b>mean</b> <b>times</b> <b>to</b> failure and <b>mean</b> <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>repair)</b> of the different machines have different orders of magnitude. Such a situation may be encountered in real production lines. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose an improvement of Gershwin's original decomposition method that provides accurate results even in the above mentioned situation. The basic difference between the decomposition method presented in this paper with that of Gershwin is that the <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> of the equivalent machines are modeled as generalized exponential distributions (Kouvatsos 1986) instead of exponential distributions. This allows us to use a two-moment approximation instead of a one- moment approximation of the repair time distributions of these equivalent machines...|$|R

40|$|The use of prognostics {{and health}} {{management}} (PHM) systems can improve operational reliability by reducing delays and cancellations caused by unscheduled maintenance events and no-fault-founds (NFFs). While PHM systems have no influence on components’ failure distributions, they {{can improve the}} operational reliability of an aircraft. This is achieved by performing maintenance tasks prior a component failure based on the remaining useful life (RUL) predicted by the PHM system and by reducing NFFs based on health monitoring information of the PHM system. This study presents {{an analysis of the}} monetary potential of an improved operational reliability and reduced maintenance costs realized by the use of a PHM system. Therefore an aircraft lifecycle cost-benefit approach is chosen to conduct an economic assessment from an airline perspective. By modeling the aircraft operation based on a weekly flight plan and the maintenance simulated as discrete events within the aircraft life-cycle it is possible to analyze the influence of changes in operational reliability on aircraft utilization and the net benefit for the operator. To show the potential benefits of PHM systems within different aircraft systems (ATA-Chapters) a parameter variation of a notional aircraft system has been performed on a 150 -seat short-range aircraft. Effects based on PHM have been modeled by a variation of <b>mean</b> <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> (MTTR), <b>mean</b> <b>times</b> between unscheduled removals (MTBUR) and the aircraft price.

In the {{early stage of}} the Weapons Acquisition Process (Concept Exploration and Concept Demonstration/Validation Phases) no exact and reliable data are available about expected <b>Mean</b> <b>Times</b> Between Failures (MTBF) and <b>Mean</b> <b>Times</b> <b>to</b> <b>Repair</b> (MTTR) for both the components of a new system or the new system itself. Nevertheless, appropriate decisions {{have to be made}} about the number of maintenance facilities at certain military command levels, about the needed quantity of (military and/or civilian) maintenance personnel, and about adequate spare stock levels at the appropriate locations. Wrong planning in this early stage can cause a degradation of the new system's future availability. This is problematic especially with electronic equipment, because maintenance personnel have to be highly specialized, and can not be replaced and retrained as easily as support personnel for trucks or tanks. A decision aid for {{the early stages of the}} acquisition process is needed that offers insight into the behavior of a multi-indenture level electronic system within a three echelon maintenance system, develops alternatives for upcoming decisions, and finally provides information about sensitive factors and their possible tradeoffs, essentially used in budgetary discussions. The purpose of this thesis is the exact definition of all relevant factors pertaining to the necessary decisions, the review of existing models and tools and their review for applicability. Because the modification of existing programs can not solve the whole scope of the problem due to the use of early generation computer languages, and due to the necessarily new and different approach to the topic, a new simulation program has to be developed. Using object oriented simulation language MODSIM-II, first steps towards this program are made, but remain to be improved and completed in further research work.

40|$|RELAV (Reliability/Availability Analysis Program) is a {{comprehensive}} analytical tool to determine the reliability or availability of any general system which can be modeled as embedded k-out-of-n groups of items (components) and/or subgroups. Both ground and flight systems at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory have utilized this program. RELAV can assess current system performance during the later testing phases of a system design, as well as model candidate designs/architectures or validate and form predictions during the early phases of a design. Systems are commonly modeled as System Block Diagrams (SBDs). RELAV calculates the success probability of each group of items and/or subgroups within the system assuming k-out-of-n operating rules apply for each group. The program operates on a folding basis; i. e. it works its way towards the system level from the most embedded level by folding related groups into single components. The entire folding process involves probabilities; therefore, availability problems are performed {{in terms of the}} probability of success, and reliability problems are performed for specific mission lengths. An enhanced cumulative binomial algorithm is used for groups where all probabilities are equal, while a fast algorithm based upon "Computing k-out-of-n System Reliability", Barlow & Heidtmann, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY, October 1984, is used for groups with unequal probabilities. Inputs to the program include a description of the system and any one of the following: 1) availabilities of the items, 2) <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> between failures and <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>repairs</b> for the items from which availabilities are calculated, 3) <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> between failures and mission length(s) from which reliabilities are calculated, or 4) failure rates and mission length(s) from which reliabilities are calculated. The results are probabilities of success of each group and the system in the given configuration. RELAV assumes exponential failure distributions for reliability calculations and infinite repair resources for availability calculations. No more than 967 items or groups can be modeled by RELAV. If larger problems can be broken into subsystems of 967 items or less, the subsystem results can be used as item inputs to a system problem. The calculated availabilities are steady-state values. Group results are presented in the order in which they were calculated (from the most embedded level out to the system level). This provides a good mechanism to perform trade studies. Starting from the system result and working backwards, the granularity gets finer; therefore, system elements that contribute most to system degradation are detected quickly. RELAV is a C-language program originally developed under the UNIX operating system on a MASSCOMP MC 500 computer. It has been modified, as necessary, and ported to an IBM PC compatible with a math coprocessor. The current version of the program runs in the DOS environment and requires a Turbo C vers. 2. 0 compiler. RELAV has a memory requirement of 103 KB and was developed in 1989.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of teaching core tendon repairs using a simulation model, ten surgical residents with no prior experience repairing flexor tendons were taught a four-strand cruciate repair. The residents then performed ten repairs each on a simulated tendon (a round synthetic bait worm 10  mm in diameter) while being timed and graded by a hand surgeon using a global rating scale (1 to 5). Six residents also performed a zone IV flexor tendon repair on a fresh frozen cadaver—three residents who had practiced and three other residents who had no practice on the simulated tendon. The mean initial quality score was 2. 4 / 5. 0 which improved to 4. 8 / 5. 0 by the tenth trial. There was a significant incremental improvement in mean performance from trial 1 to 10 (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001). The <b>mean</b> <b>times</b> <b>to</b> complete the first and last repairs were 5. 4 and 3. 0  min, respectively. In the cadaver trial, there was statistically significant evidence (p[*]=[*] 0. 05, one-sided Wilcoxon exact test) that the three residents previously trained with the simulated tendon had a higher median performance (4. 4, min[*]=[*] 4. 3, max[*]=[*] 4. 8) than the three who had not been trained (1. 8, min[*]=[*] 1. 7, max[*]=[*] 2. 1). The <b>mean</b> <b>times</b> <b>to</b> complete the <b>repairs</b> were 4. 0 and 5. 8  min, respectively.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAcute Achilles tendon rupture can {{be treated}} {{conservatively}} or surgically. Open surgery restores tendon continuity but carries a risk of skin complications. Tenolig® is a device designed for the percutaneous biological treatment of acute Achilles tendon rupture. Earlier studies found high rates of recurrent tears and nerve injury after Tenolig® repair. HypothesisWe hypothesised that intra-operative ultrasonography during Tenolig® repair would decrease the post-operative complication rate and improve functional outcomes. Materials and methodsWe studied 75 consecutive patients {{with a mean age}} of 39. 9 years. The injury was sports-related in 82. 8 % of cases. Mean distance from the calcaneal tendon attachment to the tear was 5 cm and <b>mean</b> <b>time</b> from injury <b>to</b> <b>repair</b> was 4. 2 days. All patients underwent Tenolig® repair under ultrasound guidance followed by early rehabilitation therapy with partial weight bearing started after 3 weeks. ResultsMean follow-up was 20. 7 months and no patient was lost to follow-up. A single patient (1. 3 %) experienced rerupture and none had permanent sural nerve damage. <b>Mean</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> sports resumption was 8. 6 months, with two-thirds of patients returning to their previous level of sporting activities. The mean AOFAS functional score was 95 and the mean ATRS score was 91. 3. DiscussionOur experience suggests that intra-operative ultrasonography, a non-invasive, widely available, and accurate tool, provided improved control of Tenolig® suture position. Ultrasonography provided valuable guidance during this demanding procedure and allowed the very early initiation of rehabilitation therapy. Another crucial factor is patient education about the physical therapy programme. Attention to this point allowed us to obtain robust and reliable functional outcomes in a population predominantly composed of athletes. Level of evidenceLevel IV...|$|R
