5|$|Once Beach {{accepted}} the commission on March 12, 1928, Juliette Fraser's sketches were forwarded to him. On April 7, he sent completed models to the <b>Mint</b> <b>and</b> photographs to the Fine Arts Commission. Both the <b>Mint</b> <b>and</b> Houston responded with criticism, the former that {{the relief of}} the coin was high and difficult to reduce to coin-sized hubs. On April 19, Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock wrote in a memorandum that the coin {{would be very hard}} to produce because the area of greatest relief on each side was in the same part of the design. Beach agreed to lower any high points that might cause the Mint difficulty.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the initial}} discovery, a bin {{containing}} several thousand of the error coins was impounded at the Philadelphia <b>Mint,</b> <b>and</b> all such coins within it were ordered melted. Some of the coins {{that had been}} released were eventually tracked back to a coin-wrapping facility near Philadelphia. Employees at the wrapping facility were instructed to watch {{for any of the}} coins; those discovered were turned over to the Mint.|$|E
5|$|In proposing {{his plan}} for a <b>mint</b> <b>and</b> a coinage system, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton in 1791 {{proposed}} that the one-dollar denomination be struck both as a gold coin, and as one of silver, representative of the two metals which he proposed be made legal tender. Congress followed Hamilton's recommendation only in part, authorizing a silver dollar, but no coin of that denomination in gold.|$|E
5|$|In the assembly, Larrea {{promoted}} a customs law which taxed most imports, but made exceptions for machines, scientific tools, books, weapons and military supplies. He organized a local <b>mint,</b> <b>and</b> {{the supply of}} the Army of the North. The presidency of the assembly rotated, and Larrea presided from April 30 to June 1, 1813. During this time the Assembly outlawed torture and repealed all noble titles, and also chose the official Argentine National Anthem.|$|E

5|$|Knox, in his 1866 report, had {{recommended}} a thorough {{revision of the}} laws pertaining to the <b>Mint,</b> <b>and</b> in January 1870, Secretary Boutwell instructed him to prepare a draft.

5|$|Lawrie and Vinson {{approved}} the models. On January 8, Ross telephoned the commission, informing them of this. With Sinnock ill (he died in 1947) and the March of Dimes campaign under way, Ross did {{not wait for}} a full meeting of the commission, but authorized the start of production. This caused some ill-feeling between the <b>Mint</b> <b>and</b> the commission, but she believed that she had fulfilled her obligations under the executive order.|$|E

5|$|The {{birth of}} the Smithsonian Institution {{can be traced to}} the {{acceptance}} of James Smithson's legacy, willed to the United States in 1826. Smithson died in 1829, and in 1836, President Andrew Jackson informed Congress of the gift, which it accepted. In 1838, Smithson's legacy, which totaled more than $500,000, was delivered to the United States <b>Mint</b> <b>and</b> entered the Treasury. After eight years, in 1846, the Smithsonian Institution was established.|$|E
5|$|All {{dates of}} the dollar also exist in proof finish. The 1999 coins were sold as {{standalone}} proof strikes, rather than {{as part of a}} larger proof set, as the 1979, 1980 and 1981 issues were offered. The 1999 proof was minted exclusively at the Philadelphia <b>Mint,</b> <b>and</b> bears a 'P' mint mark, while all other proof Anthony dollars were minted at San Francisco and bear the 'S' of that Mint. Some 1979 and 1981 proofs bear a mint mark which was applied to the coinage dies with a different punch, causing them to have a more legible appearance. They are considered scarce and are valued considerably higher than normal proofs of the series.|$|E
5|$|By 1857, {{both the}} Royal <b>Mint</b> <b>and</b> the public were {{dissatisfied}} {{by the state}} of the copper coinage. Much of it was worn or defaced by advertisements, and 14 percent of the pennies in commerce were Boulton's 1797 cartwheels. The fact that pennies of different specifications circulated side by side precluded the weighing of quantities of copper coin to ascertain the value. Both sorts of pennies were deemed too heavy for daily use. The copper coins were so heavy that Charles Dickens in Nicholas Nickleby had Mr Mantalini contemplate suicide by drowning himself in the Thames, his pockets filled with halfpennies.|$|E

5|$|Congress {{approved}} {{legislation for}} the coin on March 31, 1936, authorizing 15,000 pieces {{to be struck}} at the three mints then in operation. Melish had hired sculptor Constance Ortmayer to design the coin, but the Commission of Fine Arts refused to recommend the designs. Members objected to the depiction of Stephen Foster on the obverse, finding no connection between Foster, who died in 1864, and the supposed anniversary. Nevertheless, the designs were approved by the Bureau of the <b>Mint,</b> <b>and</b> 5,000 sets from the three mints were issued and sold to Melish's group, the only authorized purchaser.|$|E

5|$|One 1954 penny is known, struck for die-testing {{purposes}} at the Royal <b>Mint,</b> <b>and</b> {{intended for}} melting, but recovered from circulation. By {{the end of}} the 1950s, the price of metal ensured that every bronze coin was struck at a loss; the Mint hoped for a reduction in size, and the demonetisation of the farthing at the end of 1960 helped clear the way for such a scheme. It was not until 1961 that there was a need for more pennies to be minted, and production continued each year in very large numbers until the final pre-decimal pennies for circulation, dated 1967, were coined.|$|E
