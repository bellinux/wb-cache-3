40|$|Buffalo, New York, {{has lost}} {{half of its}} {{population}} since 1950. Once a booming manufacturing town, the city's economy collapsed when owners moved their factories out of state or overseas in search of lower production costs. Today, nearly one in six homes is vacant, much of the abandonment concentrated on the city’s east side. This 11 -minute video examines how the city of Buffalo is dealing with its overwhelming vacancy problem. The piece opens with Tracy Krug, one of Buffalo’s two building inspectors, {{as he makes his}} daily rounds inspecting vacant buildings in the severely blighted east side neighborhood. Next are scenes showing the city’s two main strategies for combating vacancies: a demolition site and the annual foreclosure auction, where properties sell for as low as $ 500. The video also follows three groups of Buffalo residents who have found opportunity in the blight. Keith James, a Buffalo native and 18 -year veteran of the fire department, has started a small investment group that buys up cheap properties at the city auction, rehabs them, and sells them for a reasonable price to existing renters, making them owners with a stake in the neighborhood’s recovery. Kevin Hayes runs Buffalo Reuse, a green demolition company that salvages parts from demolished buildings and sells them to rehabbers instead of throwing them into a landfill. Janice and Mark Stevens, and their seven children, are Christian homesteaders who moved to Buffalo from a rural part of the state four years ago, attracted by the abundance of arable vacant land and the low cost of living. They cultivate two acres behind their house and homeschool their children. When the family needs money, <b>Mark</b> <b>works</b> in construction. The end of the piece contrasts the city’s long-term vision for jumpstarting its economy out of a decades-long slump with the immediate challenges facing a young Buffalo native who, unable to find work, is weighing whether to stay in the city or move away...|$|E

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} frequent portrayal of substantive interactions between characters from widely separated socio-economic backgrounds in British fiction written between 1890 and 1925. I designate these scenes as moments of "inter-class connection," and through them, I {{argue that the}} rise of professional society and the burgeoning of commodity culture in the 1880 's transformed the way that texts portray class relations. Works written after 1890 seek to ameliorate the cultural anxieties that accompany inter-class connection by erasing the individualized identity {{of one of the}} characters involved. Because it entails a removal of subjectivity, I label this practice "objectification. " It represents a significant departure from Victorian fiction where texts assimilate those same cultural anxieties through elaborate plot manipulations, such as the sudden revelation that a character thought to be from the lower classes actually possesses a hidden noble heritage. My study examines both the formal and thematic implications of this change. In most cases, objectification emerges as only a partially realized fictional practice that cannot be sustained over the course of an entire narrative, and when it does collapse, these works return to the example of their Victorian predecessors and resolve class interaction through plot machinations. Overwhelmingly, those reversions in formal practice <b>mark</b> <b>works</b> as rhetorically reactionary because they signal a staunch commitment to maintaining elements of low culture excluded from the insular domain of high culture. 	The introduction delineates the basic criteria for inter-class connection and presents numerous examples of it {{in a wide variety of}} texts. It also examines the historical, social and economic factors that fostered the emergence of objectification as a narrative practice. Subsequent chapters provide a detailed analysis of specific cases of inter-class connection and their accompanying strategies of objectification found in the following turn-of-the-century texts: Thomas Hardy's TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES (1891), Oscar Wilde's THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (1891), George Gissing's NEW GRUB STREET (1891), and Katherine Mansfield's "The Garden Party" (1922) ...|$|E

50|$|Mark Blumes, {{formerly}} a retail executive for the Hudson's Bay Company, opened <b>Mark's</b> <b>Work</b> Wearhouse in Calgary, Alberta on August 14, 1977. The store {{was located in}} the Southeast corner of Calgary at Centre Street and Glenmore Trail. Following early success and rapid expansion, the company became publicly traded in 1981 with an Initial Public Offering worth $14,000,000. In 1995, the Board of Directors appointed Garth Mitchell as President and Chief Operating Officer of the company. Under Mitchell, the chain entered a new phase characterized by growth and acquisition. The 140 stores in 1996 generated a revenue of $250 million, and the company acquired Work World which increased revenues by $500 million in six years. In 2002, Canadian Tire Corporation purchased <b>Mark’s</b> <b>Work</b> Wearhouse for $116 million {{as part of a}} strategic plan to add strong and profitable growth within the company’s integrated portfolio of businesses. At this time, <b>Mark's</b> <b>Work</b> Wearhouse operated 325 corporate and franchisee stores across the country. The acquisition provided <b>Mark’s</b> <b>Work</b> Wearhouse with significant working capital, resulting in accelerated growth between 2001 and 2008. Sales grew from $500 million to $1 billion, with 372 stores across Canada. Together, <b>Mark’s</b> <b>Work</b> Wearhouse and Canadian Tire created “combo stores” at 65 Canadian Tire locations which coupled the complete assortment of a Canadian Tire store with a fully serviced <b>Mark’s</b> <b>Work</b> Wearhouse. In 2012, the company underwent a rebrand as part of its strategy to appeal to a wider customer base and reflect its expanded product assortment. Now referred to as Mark’s, the brand launched its newest ad campaign ‘Ready for This’ in 2013.|$|R
