A passenger information office and lounge are above the subway, the British Transport Police office and cycle racks are beyond, and at the western end is Platform 4, used by only a few trains. Alongside this is Platform 2, another bay platform but not signalled for passenger trains and used only for stabling empty trains, as is the former <b>Motorail</b> unloading bay alongside. At the far end of this track is the old Fish Dock, occasionally used for stabling engineers' on-track equipment. Beyond the end of the platform the tracks swing to the right (the west) and pass out of sight beneath Bath Road Bridge, a girder bridge that carries the A4 out of the city.|$|E

25|$|The train {{also has}} a <b>Motorail</b> service to carry passengers' motor vehicles. This {{facility}} was available throughout the journey until November 2015, when it was reduced to only operate between Adelaide and Perth.|$|E

25|$|On 5 March 1995, {{responsibility}} for {{operation of the}} Anglo-Scottish services passed within British Rail from InterCity West Coast to ScotRail. British Rail had proposed to cease operating the Fort William portion, however the Highland Regional Council successfully sought a stay pending a formal consultation, after the Scottish Court of Session ruled that the correct service closure process had not been followed. Eventually British Rail agreed to retain the Fort William portion, but it was reduced from four sleeping carriages to one. The <b>motorail</b> service was withdrawn in 1995.|$|E
25|$|The premier trains on the North Coast line {{were the}} two daily {{services}} to Brisbane, the Brisbane Limited and the Brisbane Express. The Limited was the fastest service, stopping only at major stations, while the Express operated as a sweeper service stopping at most stations north of Grafton and provided connections to services on the Murwillumbah branch. Air-conditioned Sleeping cars had operated on the Brisbane Limited from 1960. In April 1973 the Brisbane Express was withdrawn and replaced by the Gold Coast <b>Motorail,</b> operating to Murwillumbah. The North Coast Daylight Express and North Coast Mail operated to Grafton until they were both replaced in 1985 by a single Holiday Coast XPT train. Following the Booz Allen Hamilton review of 1989 which recommended severe rationalisation of country rail services, the Brisbane and Murwillumbah services were converted to XPT operation in February 1990, and a locomotive hauled Grafton Express service to Grafton introduced in June 1990. In November 1993 the Grafton Express was also converted to XPT operation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1966 British Rail {{launched}} <b>Motorail,</b> {{a long-distance}} {{accompanied car train}} which transported passengers and their cars to the West of England and Scotland. The London <b>Motorail</b> [...] terminal was at Kensington (Olympia), using the West London Line for its wide connections to the UK mainline rail network. <b>Motorail</b> ceased operations in 1981.|$|E
2500|$|A {{series of}} major {{changes were made}} on 1 February 1981. [...] The {{new version of the}} Railcard became valid for either one or two adults, with no {{distinction}} in price—so the separate [...] "joint-holder Railcard" [...] ceased to exist. [...] The price was changed to £10.00; the Railcard holder now gained a discount of 50% on off-peak fares; the child flat fare became £1.00; and two other adults (in addition to the holder/s) could travel in the group for half fare. [...] Other than a price rise in 1983, and some discounts on <b>Motorail</b> services, Sealink ferry services to the Channel Islands and rail-based holidays, the conditions remained the same until 1985.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the next}} few years, until the next major {{revision}} in 1985, the main changes to the Railcards' conditions related to the qualification criteria. [...] From January 1978, these were extended slightly, with people aged 60 or over who received Widow's Pensions or War Widow's Pensions being included. [...] From January 1980, anybody resident in Britain and aged at least 60 (for women) or 65 (for men), and British people living abroad but meeting these age criteria, could buy the Railcard. [...] Finally, from 30 March 1984, a further simplification took place: anybody aged 60 or over could hold one. [...] This condition still applies as of 2007. [...] Other additions included the introduction of certain discounts on <b>Motorail</b> services, London Underground journeys (these were charged at child rate for Railcard holders), through travel to the Isle of Man and various European destinations, and discounts on all-inclusive holidays by rail.|$|E

50|$|In the 1960s, {{the volume}} of <b>motorail</b> {{services}} was increasing. Therefore, Deutsche Bundesbahn decided to build a car loading dock. The first <b>motorail</b> services ran in 1962 between Kornwestheim and Villach.|$|E
50|$|The Victorian Railways {{formerly}} offered <b>Motorail</b> on its Vinelander, and Sunraysia {{services on}} the Mildura line. The New South Wales Railways (later the Public Transport Commission) once offered <b>Motorail</b> services on its long-distance lines.|$|E

Both destinations in Italy. The Euro-Express is operating {{on behalf of the}} Dutch travel agency Treinreiswinkel. Treinreiswinkel, by travelling from Düsseldorf, compensates for the loss of <b>motorail</b> services from the Netherlands to Italy, formerly starting from 's-Hertogenbosch (Den Bosch).|$|E
50|$|In Europe, many <b>motorail</b> {{connections}} are running cross-border between different European countries. To be mentioned are trains between Austria—Germany, Austria—Italy, Germany—Italy, Czech Republic—Slovakia and Serbia—Montenegro. Some domestic services exist as well.

50|$|From 18 June 1965 {{the station}} became the {{terminus}} of a seasonal <b>motorail</b> service from London, the end loading dock behind the former main (Up side) platform {{being used for}} unloading the cars. Early photographs show the station building to be shorter than it is today, with the extension carried out along with refurbishment for <b>motorail</b> traffic. <b>Motorail</b> kept the station in use each summer season until the regular service ended on 19 September 1980 and the occasional peak service on 16 September 1982.|$|E
50|$|Austrian railway ÖBB {{took over}} most <b>motorail</b> {{services}} from DB Autozug.

50|$|Murwillumbah had one platform, with {{a passing}} loop and <b>motorail</b> siding at the {{northern}} end of the station.

50|$|As such, car shuttle train {{services}} {{are to be}} contrasted with Auto Train or <b>Motorail</b> services. Unlike a car shuttle train, an Auto Train or <b>Motorail</b> train is a passenger train on which, except in France, passengers can take their car or automobile along with them. On Auto Trains or <b>Motorail</b> trains, passengers are carried in normal passenger cars or in sleeping cars on longer journeys, while the cars or automobiles are loaded separately into autoracks, car carriers, or flatcars that normally form {{part of the same}} train.|$|E
