40|$|AbstractCentral Europe {{cities are}} the “first / last legs” of {{transnational}} transport chains. These chains consist of local, regional and transnational transport systems. On {{the one hand}} high speed connections among rail hubs in Central Europe are being upgraded, especially on TEN-T networks and along the <b>main</b> <b>intercity</b> <b>lines.</b> On the other hand nevertheless rail and in general public transport bound feeder lines need to be upgraded, strengthened and better organized. That calls for a multimodal integration of local/city transport networks, regional transport systems and transnational transport axes in particular TEN-T. In fact the main elements of this integration are constituted by city rail hubs. In order to enhance rail transport by improving the feeding functions on rail of major hub cities and their respective regions 11 partners from 7 countries cooperate in the RAILHUC project. This project aims to improve Central Europe's interconnectivity by an intermodal integration of rail hubs at three different levels: into the TEN-T system, into regional and local transport rail and non-rail systems. The challenge that the RAILHUC partners share {{is the development of}} models, concepts, measures, harmonized strategies and policy actions targeted at the embedding of the urban and regional transport systems into the intercity rail transport throughout the whole Central Europe area. This paper aims to give an overview about the modelling results and the designed interventions planned at participating hub cities and their respective catchment area...|$|R
50|$|Since 1996 Chiltern Railways {{has used}} its lines south of Aylesbury for local {{services}} into London, and the alternative route south of Haddenham and widened lines south of Neasden for its <b>intercity</b> <b>main</b> <b>line</b> from Birmingham to London.

5000|$|The Garnkirk and Glasgow had {{originally}} {{been one of the}} [...] "coal railways" [...] but its management was more progressive and at first a close ally, it gradually became a competitor. It changed its gauge to standard {{a few weeks after the}} M&KR, and it opened its new line by-passing the M&KR in 1845, becoming the Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway (GG&CR), and allying itself more closely with the Wishaw and Coltness Railway (W&CR) to the south. At this time, promoters were forwarding the idea of a railway from Carlisle, connecting with the developing English network, and they needed a route from the Southern Uplands into Glasgow. This was neatly provided by the W&CR and the GG&CR, who now transformed from coal railways to elements of an <b>intercity</b> <b>main</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
