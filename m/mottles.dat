5|$|Of these viruses {{the most}} serious and {{prevalent}} are NDV, NYSV and NWSV. NDV is associated with chlorotic leaf striping in N. tazetta. Infection with NYSV produces light or grayish green, or yellow stripes or <b>mottles</b> on the upper two-thirds of the leaf, which may be roughened or twisted. The flowers which may be smaller than usual may also be streaked or blotched. NWSV produces greenish-purple streaking on the leaves and stem turning white to yellow, and premature senescence reducing bulb size and yield. These viruses are primarily diseases of commercial nurseries. The growth inhibition caused by viral infection can cause substantial economic damage.|$|E

40|$|<b>Mottle</b> {{becomes a}} major concern when {{considering}} print quality of coated paper and board, both produced with the lithographic and flexographic printing processes. Even if <b>mottle</b> {{is not a new}} phenomenon, it has been a growing problem in the printing industry, since the print quality requirements have increased strongly these past 10 years. <b>Mottle</b> was (and is still at some locations) evaluated visually. For few years now, a lot of lab instruments have appeared on the market to quantify <b>mottle.</b> But with most of them, the user has to determine an arbitrary threshold level in the scale of pixel values which will determine what is part of an object of interest or not. As a result, <b>mottle</b> measurements are not reproducible between different operators and only few of these systems demonstrate a clear correlation between the visual print quality assessment and the measured <b>mottle</b> index. An other limitation traditionally met is that only few systems allow parameters adjustments to measure <b>mottle</b> both on visible and subvisible levels. The aim of this work is to examine issues related to quantification of the overall subjective impression of <b>mottle</b> and to correlate it with color variations (two-dimensional luminance variations and chromatic variations) resulting from the <b>mottle</b> effect. <b>Mottle</b> measurements on print samples were performed with the Verity IA 2001 <b>Mottle</b> system and color variations were carried out with a spherical spectrophotometer Datacolor SF- 600 +, specular excluded.

6000|$|These are marvellous birds, and are {{the glory}} and pride of many fanciers. In their {{extremely}} short, sharp, and conical beaks, with the skin over the nostrils but little developed, they almost depart from the type of the Columbidae. Their heads are nearly globular and upright in front, so that some fanciers say (5/18. J.M. Eaton 'Treatise on Pigeons' 1852 page 9.) [...] "the head should resemble a cherry with a barleycorn stuck in it." [...] These are the smallest kind of pigeons. Mr. Esquilant possessed a blue Baldhead, two years old, which when alive weighed, before feeding-time, only 6 ounces 5 drs.; two others, each weighed 7 ounces. We have seen that a wild rock- pigeon weighed 14 ounces 2 drs., and a Runt 34 ounces 4 drs. Short-faced Tumblers have a remarkably erect carriage, with prominent breasts, drooping wings, and very small feet. The length of the beak from the tip to the feathered base was in one good bird only [...] .4 of an inch; in a wild rock- pigeon it was exactly double this length. As these Tumblers have shorter bodies than the wild rock-pigeon, they ought of course to have shorter beaks; but proportionally {{with the size of}} the body, the beak is [...] .28 of an inch too short. So, again, the feet of this bird were actually [...] .45 shorter, and proportionally [...] .21 of an inch shorter, than the feet of the rock- pigeon. The middle toe has only twelve or thirteen, instead of fourteen or fifteen scutellae. The primary wing-feathers are not rarely nine instead of ten in number. The improved short-faced Tumblers have almost lost the power of tumbling; but there are several authentic accounts of their occasionally tumbling. There are several sub-varieties, such as Bald-heads, Beards, <b>Mottles,</b> and Almonds; the latter are remarkable from not acquiring their perfectly-coloured plumage until they have moulted three or four times. There is good reason to believe that most of these sub-varieties, some of which breed truly, have arisen since the publication of Moore's treatise in 1735. (5/19. J.M.

6000|$|... 45. There's {{a spider}} here: [...] "The {{habits of the}} aranead here {{described}} point very clearly to some one of the Wandering group, which stalk their prey in the open field or in divers lurking-places, and are distinguished by this habit from the other great group, known as the Sedentary spiders, because they sit or hang upon their webs and capture their prey by means of silken snares. The next line is not determinative of the species, for {{there is a great}} number of spiders any one of which might be described as 'Sprinkled with <b>mottles</b> on an ash-gray back.' We have a little Saltigrade or Jumping spider, known as the Zebra spider (Epiblemum scenicum), which is found in Europe, and I believe also in Syria. One often sees this species and its congeners upon the ledges of rocks, the edges of tombstones, the walls of buildings, and like situations, hunting their prey, which they secure by jumping upon it. So common is the Zebra spider, that I might think that Browning referred to it, if I were not in doubt whether he would express the stripes of white upon its ash-gray abdomen by the word 'mottles.' However, there arc other spiders belonging to the same tribe (Saltigrades) that really are mottled. There are also spiders known as the Lycosids or Wolf spiders or Ground spiders, which are often of an ash-gray color, and marked with little whitish spots after the manner of Browning's Syrian species. Perhaps the poet had one of these in mind, at least he accurately describes their manner of seeking prey. The next line is an interrupted one, 'Take five and drop them. [...] .' Take five what? Five of these ash-gray mottled spiders? Certainly. But what can be meant by the expression 'drop them'? This opens up to us a strange chapter in human superstition. It was long a prevalent idea that the spider in various forms possessed some occult power of healing, and men administered it internally or applied it externally as a cure for many diseases. Pliny gives a number of such remedies. A certain spider applied in a piece of cloth, or another one ('a white spider with very elongated thin legs'), beaten up in oil is said by this ancient writer upon Natural History to form an ointment for the eyes. Similarly, 'the thick pulp of a spider's body, mixed with the oil of roses, is used for the ears.' Sir Matthew Lister, who was indeed the father of English araneology, is quoted in Dr. James's Medical Dictionary as using the distilled water of boiled black spiders as an excellent cure for wounds."

METHODS: In patients admitted in ICU for septic shock, we measured on the same area the mean skin perfusion by laser Doppler, the <b>mottling</b> score, and variations of both indices between T 1 (6 hours after vasopressors were started) and T 2 (24 hours later). RESULTS: Fourteen patients were included, SAPS II was 56 [37 [...] 71] and SOFA score at T 1 was 10 [7 [...] 12]. The mean skin surface area analyzed was 4108 +/- 740 mm 2; 1184 +/- 141 measurements were performed over each defined skin surface area. Skin perfusion was significantly different according to <b>mottling</b> score and decreased from 37 [31 [...] 42] perfusion units (PUs) for a <b>mottling</b> score of [0 [...] 1] to 22 [20 [...] 32] PUs for a <b>mottling</b> score of [2 [...] 3] and 23 [16 [...] 28] for a score of [4 [...] 5] (Kruskal-Wallis test, P = 0. 05). We analyzed skin perfusion changes during resuscitation in each patient and together with <b>mottling</b> score variations between T 1 and T 2 using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Among the 14 patients included, <b>mottling</b> score increased (worsened) in 5 patients, decreased (improved) in 5 patients, and remained stable in 4 patients. Baseline skin perfusion at T 1 was arbitrarily scored 100 %. Mean skin perfusion significantly decreased in all the patients whose <b>mottling</b> score worsened from 100 % baseline to 63. 2 +/- 10. 7 % (P = 0. 001), mean skin perfusion significantly increased in all patients whose <b>mottling</b> score improved from 100 % baseline to 172. 6 +/- 46. 8 % (P = 0. 001), and remained stable in patients whose <b>mottling</b> score did not change (100. 5 +/- 6. 8 %, P = 0. 95).

40|$|One of the {{printing}} troubles on print quality is non-uniformity of printing density called print <b>mottle.</b> The causes of print <b>mottle</b> are various. As far as paper, {{it has been}} thought that surface roughness of paper, absorption of ink and fountain solution cause non-uniformity of ink transfer. As the results of evaluation on commercial coated paper, print <b>mottle</b> did not occur in solid area and non-uniformity of ink transfer also did not arise. But print <b>mottle</b> occurred in halftone dots, and it was thought another factor except ink transfer affect print <b>mottle</b> in halftone dots. This was confirmed because print <b>mottle</b> was also observed in halftone dots which shape and density were quite even on the paper (chemical proof). The purpose {{of this research is}} to clarify the cause affecting print <b>mottle</b> in halftone dots. It is known that apparent dot gain (optical dot gain) arises in halftone dots due to lateral light scattering of printing medium, and optical dot gain affects printing density. We set up a hypothesis that non-uniformity of optical dot gain causes print <b>mottle</b> in halftone dots. Therefore, we investigated the non-uniformity of lateral light scattering of paper that was thought to bring about the non-uniformity of optical dot gain. In the past researches to measure the lateral light scattering, ruled-lines were formed on the paper, the modulation arisen in amplitude of microdensity profile of ruled-lines due to light scattering, and light intensity distribution against distance was calculated from the modulation. We measured the modulation using printed ruled-lines on paper.
