30|$|These epigeic {{earthworms}} being voracious feeders can consume {{large quantities}} of different organic materials. In spite of their high rate of consumption, they utilize {{only a very small}} part of the consumed food for their body synthesis and excrete about 90 % to 95 % of the ingested materials as vermicast. Since the intestines of the earthworms harbor high concentrations of various kinds of microorganisms ([Wallwork 1984]), these vermicasts exhibit rich population of these organisms also ([Atlavinyte] and[Vanagas][1982]). Analysis of gut content of the earthworms has revealed the occurrence of different kinds of symbionts like microfungi, bacteria, protozoans, actinomycetes, etc. ([Dash] and[Senapati][1986]). Earthworm guts provide congenial environmental condition for their proliferation, and hence, the total numbers of such microorganisms in earthworm intestines generally increase many folds as compared to their habitats ([Ponomarera][1962]). The food materials ingested by the earthworms are, thus, subjected to more intense microbial activity in the alimentary canal not only due to these higher concentrations of different microorganisms but also owing to increased surface area of the food particles meshed to very fine sizes while passing through the gizzard. In addition to the activities of the microbes, occurrence of various enzymes in earthworm guts also helps such processes. These enzymes operate in near neutral to slightly alkaline pH range in the intestinal fluid of the worms ([Senapati 1993]). In addition, existence of various hormones, antibiotics, etc. has also been reported in earthworm gut ([Edwards] and[Lofty][1972]). All these components <b>mix</b> <b>thoroughly</b> with the food materials in the intestines of the earthworms and are released with their excreta to be known as vermicast. These vermicasts undergo rapid aerobic decomposition in presence of different microbes, which activity is accelerated by various enzymes and encouraged by occurrence of numbers of growth promoting substances. Aerobic microorganisms, being more active decomposers than the anaerobes, degrade vermicasts more rapidly than the traditional ‘pit composting’ methods, and a nutrient rich well-humified organic manure is obtained in shorter period of time which is termed as ‘vermicompost’ ([Chattopadhyay 2005]).|$|E
40|$|Authors: Vera Fonseca, Margaret Packer, Gary Carvalho, Deborah Power, John Lambshead & Simon Creer ### Abstract This {{protocol}} {{describes the}} separation of marine meiofauna from sediment and subsequent environmental DNA extraction. In this study meiofauna samples were taken with a 45 mm core from the upper 5 to 10 cm of sediment layer. Separation from sediment was achieved using a decantation process followed by isolation from fine silt using repetitive centrifugation steps with a 1. 16 specific gravity (sg) LUDOX-TM solution. Meiofauna were deliberately separated from macrofauna by using a 1 mm sieve {{on top of a}} bottle-top sterile 45 µM sieve. High quality DNA was subsequently obtained using the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen) with minor adjustments to the manufacturer’s protocol. This procedure allowed efficient isolation of meiofaunal representatives from marine sediments and also extraction of high quality environmental DNA {{that can be used for}} downstream metagenetic analysis. ### Reagents 1. DESS: 20 % DMSO, 0. 25 M disodium EDTA, saturated with NaCl, pH 8. 0 (1). - LUDOX-TM concentrate: 800 ml of conc. LUDOX-TM, 1200 ml of dH 2 O, shake vigorously until solution is homogenous, rectify specific gravity (sg) until it is 1. 16. - DNA lysis buffer: 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7. 5; 100 mM NaCl; 100 mM EDTA; 1 % SDS, 500 µg/ ml proteinase K - QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen) - 100 % Ethanol - 1. 5 ml Eppendorf tubes, 15 ml falcon tubes, 50 ml falcon tubes ### Equipment 1. 1 mm and 45 µM analytical grade stainless steel wire mesh sieves - Bottle-top 47 mm 45 µM membrane filters and disposable filter holder (Millipore, NY 4104700 and MVHAWG 124) - UV transilluminator chamber - Bench-top centrifuge with swing-arm rotor and adapters for 15 ml and 50 ml rotor adapters - - 20 C and - 80 C freezers ### Procedure **CRITICAL** Where possible, all equipment should be autoclaved between samples. If not possible, the use of a UV transilluminator/ cross linker (according to manufacturer’s instructions) and/or immersion in sodium metabisulfite solution will reduce cross contamination between samples. **Meiofauna extraction** *Separation from sediment – decantation* 1. Collect benthic samples (ca. 150 ml) into storage pots containing 300 ml of DESS solution. - TIP: Maintain at least 1 : 3 ratio of wet sediment sample to DESS ratio for efficient DNA preservation. - Dispose the aqueous DESS-phase of each benthic sample through a 45 µM wire mesh sieve into a chemical waste container and rinse with 45 µM filtered water. DMSO should not be introduced into freshwater ecosystems. - Pour all the sediment-phase of each benthic sample into a 2 L measuring cylinder and rinse the storage pot as well as the 45 µM wire mesh sieve with 45 µM filtered tap water into the cylinder. - Fill the 2 L measuring cylinder with 45 µM filtered tap water, seal with lid, invert the cylinder vigorously 10 times and let it rest for no more than 30 seconds. - Gently pour the decanted samples onto a 45 µM wire mesh sieve and repeat steps 4 and 5 six times. - TIP: Do not lean the cylinder more than a 40 degree angle; the less sediment in suspension decanted with your community, the better. - Localise your biotic sample into the corner of the sieve and rinse into a sample pot using DESS and store the pots at 4 C until use. *Separation from fine silt – centrifugation* 1. Use a 1 mm sieve on top of a bottle-top sterile 47 mm 45 µM membrane filter and pour in the DESS decanted sample, keep a DESS container under the last sieve (e. g. petri dish). - Wash the sample retained on the bottle-top 47 mm 45 µM membrane filter with distilled water. - Again, wash the sample retained on the bottle-top 47 mm 45 µM membrane filter but this time with 1. 16 sg LUDOX-TM and pour it into a 50 ml falcon tube and top up if necessary with 1. 16 sg LUDOX-TM up to 2 cm from the top. - TIP: Do not use too much 1. 16 sg LUDOX-TM since each sample should fit into a 50 ml falcon tube. - Shake the 50 ml falcon tube vigorously, centrifuge for 5 min at 4000 rpm and carefully pour the centrifuged sample into the bottle-top membrane filter. - TIP: If samples are contaminated with fine sediments, use a vacuum filter system to help with the process. - Re-use the retained 1. 16 sg LUDOX-TM for each sample and repeat step 3 five times. - Rinse the sample retained on the bottle-top 47 mm 45 µM membrane filter with distilled water. - Carefully detach the bottle-top sterile 47 mm 45 µM membrane filter and with the help of sterile forceps and blade, carefully fold and slice the 45 µM filter into three pieces. - Place the sliced 45 µM membrane filter inside a 15 ml falcon tube and store at - 80 C until subsequent DNA extraction. *DNA extraction* 1. C overnight in 3 ml of DNA lysis buffer assisted by spinning wheel mixing.  1. Incubate each sample retained in the 15 ml falcon tubes at 56 - Transfer the 3 ml digested solution into a sterile 50 ml falcon tube. - Add 6 ml of Buffer AL (QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit, Qiagen) and <b>mix</b> <b>thoroughly</b> by inversion. - Add 5 ml of 100 % ethanol and <b>mix</b> <b>thoroughly</b> by inversion. - Follow QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen) manufacturer’s protocol. - TIP: Centrifugation and incubation times were increased by up to 15 - 30 minutes as this will ensure complete removal of Buffers AW 1 and AW 2. - Incubate each sample in 700 µl of AE Buffer (Qiagen) for at least 4 h- 8 h, prior to elution via centrifugation for 20 minutes at 5000 rpm. - TIP: A second elution with the same amount of AE Buffer can be performed overnight at room temperature as this results in higher DNA yields. - Keep samples in 1. 5 – 2 ml tubes at - 20 C until subsequent PCR amplification. ### Timing About 2 days Meiofauna extraction, 1 h and 20 minutes per sample; sample digestion, 16 hours; DNA extraction, 2 hours; DNA elution, 4 - 6 hours ### References 1.

40|$|Currently, {{the world}} is facing two crises {{from the point of}} view environmental: the {{scarcity}} of fossil fuels and environmental degradation. According to projections by 2020 the use of vehicles would triple and also increase demand for fossil fuel and therefore emissions contaminants. Compared with the gasoline engine, diesel engine has the advantage of being a more efficient engine and therefore emits less CO 2. However, produce high levels of NOx and particulates. To address these difficulties, we have proposed different actions. One solution, constitute the advanced concepts of combustion Diesel. These concepts allow to reduce levels of NOx and particulates. However, have the disadvantage of producing high levels of noise combustion, the early use of injections, which cause a more fuel is burned in premixed conditions. However, NOx emissions increased in most operating conditions. On that way, various technologies have been introduced to reduce emissions from diesel engines, the in-cylinder reduction techniques of PM and NOx like low temperature combustion (LTC which is an important field of research and development of modern diesel engines. Furthermore, increasing prices and question over the availability of diesel fuel derived from crude oil have introduced a growing interest. Hence it is most likely that future diesel engines will be operated on pure biodiesel and/or blends of biodiesel and crude oil-based diesel. Being a significant technology to reduce emissions, LTC deserves a critical analysis of emission characteristics for both diesel and biodiesel. We can divide LTC in two categories, field of our study. Those in which the combustion phasing is decoupled from the injection timing and the kinetics of the chemical reactions dominate the combustion, are in the first category which is known as HCCI mode. In the second category, combustion phasing is closely coupled to the fuel injection event which is termed as PCCI mode. PCCI combustion seeks to obtain a fully premixed charge before the start-of-combustion, which will result in fully premixed combustion. By injecting very early in the cycle, the air and fuel <b>mix</b> <b>thoroughly</b> such that, upon combustion of the mixture, there are no locally rich regions and little PM is formed. PCCI combustion differs slightly from pure HCCI combustion in that the direct fuel injection results in minor air-fuel mixture gradients, and thus the mixture is not truly homogeneous. Start of combustion is initiated by auto-ignition of the mixture when a sufficiently high cylinder temperature is attained during the compression stroke. When the auto-ignition occurs, the combustion takes place nearly instantaneously throughout the cylinder. The application of PCCI combustion suffers from several practical problems. First, because the mixture combusts almost instantaneously, the heat release is very rapid. If the auto-ignition occurs too far Before Top Dead Center (BTDC), this rapid heat release results in very high cylinder pressure rise rates, and high peak cylinder pressures. In addition, this rapid heat release tends to expose the in-cylinder nitrogen and oxygen to prolonged high temperatures, which can lead to high NOx formation rates. Second, early injection can result in spray impingement on combustion chamber wall surfaces, since the spray penetration is increased at the low gas densities in the chamber early in the compression stroke. However, perhaps the biggest challenge with PCCI combustion is control. This makes emissions control, and overall engine control, very difficult. In conclusion, the aim of this project is to open a field of knowledge of one of the most advanced new combustion concepts in low-temperature combustion, the PCCI combustion technology, which is already an important implantation via research and development in the field of the automotive industryDepartamento de Ciencias de los Materiales e Ingeniería Metalúrgica, Expresión Gráfica en la Ingeniería, Ingeniería Cartográfica, Geodesia y Fotogrametría, Ingeniería Mecánica e Ingeniería de los Procesos de FabricaciónGrado en Ingeniería Mecánic...|$|E
