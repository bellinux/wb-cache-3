50|$|Central office {{multiplexing}} (or CO <b>muxing)</b> is {{telephone exchange}} (central office) equipment that derives {{a number of}} lower speed channels from one high-bandwidth channel. This type of multiplexing is needed when the customer wants to terminate the DS1 or DS3 in the central office and wants to ‘pick up’ lower level services.

50|$|In {{telecommunications}} and computer networks, multiplexing (sometimes contracted to <b>muxing)</b> {{is a method}} by which multiple analog or digital signals are combined into one signal over a shared medium.

This requires switches that pick and multiplex more than one request per cycle. In this paper, we propose a family of circuit topologies where priority encoding picks one or two requests and takes place in parallel with <b>muxing.</b> We first present a scalable logic circuit for the 1 -pick fixed-priority <b>muxing</b> problem and then extend it to the 2 -pick problem.

The permit stipulated that <b>Mux</b> A would only be used for RTV's own channels and that commercial operators would have to use <b>Mux</b> B. Because <b>Mux</b> A became operational before <b>Mux</b> B, RTV was permitted to temporarily provide channels in their multiplex. Regular operations with <b>Mux</b> B started on 1 September 2010 and the analog turn-off took place on 1 December. Initially Pink SI was the only channel to switch to <b>Mux</b> B, although TV3 followed in October.

Norkring issued a criminal complaint to the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption of the Republic of Slovenia, claiming RTV was violating regulatory decisions through hosting commercial channels, arguing that European Union law prohibits commercial channels from being broadcast on national multiplexes.

40|$|Many {{existing}} schemes for linear-optical quantum computing (LOQC) depend on multiplexing (MUX), which uses dynamic routing to enable near-deterministic gates and sources to be constructed using heralded, probabilistic primitives. <b>MUXing</b> {{accounts for the}} overwhelming majority of active switching demands in current LOQC architectures. In this manuscript, we introduce relative multiplexing (RMUX), a general-purpose optimization which can dramatically reduce the active switching requirements for MUX in LOQC, and thereby reduce hardware complexity and energy consumption, as well as relaxing demands on performance for various photonic components. We discuss the application of RMUX to the generation of entangled states from probabilistic single-photon sources, and argue that an order of magnitude improvement in the rate of generation of Bell states can be achieved. In addition, we apply RMUX to the proposal for percolation of a 3 D cluster state in [PRL 115, 020502 (2015) ], and we find that RMUX allows a 2. 4 x increase in loss tolerance for this architecture.
