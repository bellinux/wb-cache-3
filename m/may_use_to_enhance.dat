40|$|Quality {{standards}} play {{an increasingly}} important role in international agri-food trade, and their functioning as nontariff barriers to trade is widely discussed. We argue that food quality standards imposed by importing countries {{are more than just}} border measures and can have profound effects on the market structure of the exporting industry, thereby significantly influencing the supply response. We develop a stylized oligopoly model that accounts for compliance costs (fixed and variable) and investigate alternative policy options to explore different mechanisms an importing county <b>may</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> the quality of its imports. The model explicitly recognizes the coexistence of complying and noncomplying firms, which is a situation often found in low-income countries where a small modern export-oriented segment invests in meeting foreign quality standards. We use the adjustment of the Polish meat sector to the tight EU food quality standards as an empirical example. The simulations show that a subsidy scheme can promote compliance with standards and can contribute to an upgrade of the industry in the exporting country, but its marginal effectiveness is diminishing.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} trade impacts of quality related {{standards}} from {{the supply side}} of the exporting country. We argue that food quality standards imposed by an importing country have profound effects on the market structure of the exporting industry, and hence {{a significant impact on}} the supply response. For our analysis, we develop a stylized oligopoly model that allows for the co-existence of complying and non-complying suppliers. The model is applied to two alternative policy options to explore different mechanisms an importing county <b>may</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> the quality of its imports. We take the Polish meat sector as an empirical example, since after Poland's accession to the EU the tight EU food quality standards indeed apply but the process of adjusting to them is far from complete - particularly in Polish meat production/processing. The simulations show that a subsidy scheme, such as the EU's SAPARD program in Poland, can be an effective instrument to promote the compliance with standards and to upgrade the industry in the exporting country. food quality standards, trade, market structure, Poland, meat sector, oligopoly, International Relations/Trade, Livestock Production/Industries, Q 17, Q 18, L 1,...|$|E

40|$|Pre-electoral fiscal manipulation—spending more or taxing less {{prior to}} an election—is an {{important}} tool that governments possess to enhance their chances for reelection. Existing explanations of pre-electoral fiscal manipulation focus primarily on domestic characteristics. We extend this line of inquiry by examining international influences on governments ’ decisions to engage in pre-electoral fiscal manipulation. We find that international scrutiny {{of the economy and}} international scrutiny of elections affect pre-electoral fiscal manipulation in cross-cutting ways. Using data from 1990 - 2004 for 94 developing countries, we show that pre-electoral fiscal manipulation is more likely when international election monitors make direct election manipulation more difficult, and it is less likely when governments are subject to international economic scrutiny resulting from an IMF agreement. Pre-electoral fiscal manipulation—spending more or taxing less prior to an election—is {{an important tool}} that governments <b>may</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> their chances for reelection. 1 Recent studies document that it is employed most often in new democracies (Brender and Drazen 2005) and developing countries (Shi and Svensson 2006).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the challenges facing tourist hotels in provision of good customer services in Arumeru district, Arusha region. Specifically, the study sought to address the following specific objectives, that is, to examine contributions of good customer’s services to tourist hotels, to determine challenges facing tourist hotels in provision of good customer services and to identify measures for preventing challenges and improve hotels’ customer services. The study design was a descriptive research design whereby both qualitative and quantitative studies were used. The sample size included 30 tourists, 36 hotel employees and 5 hotel managers. Purposive and simple random sampling methods were used. The data collection instruments were questionnaires, interview, direct observation and document review. Quantitative Data were analyzed by using Statistics Packages for Social Science (SPSS version 16. 0) and Microsoft excel whereby content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. The study found that unqualified staffs, poor management, poor communication system, shortage of staff were the main challenges facing tourist. These are the reasons for poor services offered in tourist hotels. Furthermore this study recommended some appropriate strategies that hotels <b>may</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> customer satisfaction.

40|$|These days, {{students}} {{approach their}} graduation and career prospects {{with a great}} deal of uncertainty and pessimism. It is granted that the circumstances within South Africa might not be conducive to creating positive career perceptions, but a large deal of this can attributed to the students themselves. Career indecision plays a role in how students formulate career goals, influences career-related thoughts and decisions, and is a good indicator of how optimistic or pessimistic students are about their future careers. Understanding career indecision and its contributory factors might help students to formulate effective strategies that they <b>may</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> their chances of career advancement. This study aims to determine if there is a difference in the levels of career indecision experienced by students enrolled in different fields of study, in different employment status situations, and between different gender groups. A convenience sample of 202 was drawn and students levels of career indecision were measured with the use of a self-administered questionnaire. The study demonstrates that a difference exists amongst students from the sample groups whose employment status differs, and those who were studying for different degrees. The findings suggest that a student 2 ̆ 7 s degree of study and employment status may have an influence on his or her levels of career indecision. The findings also indicated that there is no significant difference in the levels of career indecision experienced by males and females. Consequently, this study has important implications for certain groups that are, or should be involved in the career decision-making processes of university students, namely tertiary education institutions, career guidance counsellors and internship programme developers...|$|E

Recent {{studies have indicated}} a role for this protein in cancer development. In this study three breast cancer cell lines were stimulated {{with a variety of}} cytokines. The breast cancer cell lines (MCF 7, SK-BR- 3 and MDA-MB- 468) were chosen to reflect the hormone positive, HER- 2 enriched and triple negative subtypes of breast cancer. The cytokines (Interferon gamma, Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha, Interleukin 1 beta and Interferon alpha) are commonly encountered in the breast cancer micro-environment. Relative gene expression was measured using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. ICAM- 1 protein was measured by Western Blot and localised by Immunofluorescence. In addition, ICAM- 1 gene expression was measured in human breast cancer samples and ICAM- 1 and macrophage (CD 68) immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tumour tissue. ICAM- 1 expression was induced in all of the cell lines by IFN, TNF and IL- 1 with increased ICAM- 1 protein production compared to time-matched controls. IFN appeared to induce ICAM- 1 gene expression but no protein was detected. Membranous and para-nuclear ICAM- 1 staining was identified after 24 hours in unstimulated MCF 7 and MDA-MB- 468 cells and the same cell lines stimulated with IFN. ICAM- 1 expression was increased in the human tumour tissue compared to normal tissue however this did not correspond with ICAM- 1 positivity or numbers of macrophages in the tumour. The study highlights a mechanism that cancer cells <b>may</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>enhance</b> their invasive and metastatic potential by making use of a protein normally involved in cell migration...|$|E
