40|$|A major {{challenge}} in microbial diagnostics is the parallel detection and identification of low-bundance pathogens within a complex microbial community. In addition, a high specificity providing robust, reliable identification {{at least at}} the species level is required. A microbial diagnostic microarray approach, using single nucleotide extension labeling with gyrB as the marker gene, was developed. We present a novel concept applying competitive oligonucleotide probes to improve the specificity of the assay. Our approach enabled the sensitive and specific detection of a broad range of pathogenic bacteria. The approach was tested with a set of 35 oligonucleotide probes targeting Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Vibrio cholerae, <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium,</b> <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis,</b> Helicobacter pylori, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni. The introduction of competitive oligonucleotides in the labeling reaction successfully suppressed cross-reaction by closely related sequences, significantly improving the performance of the assay. Environmental applicability was tested with environmental and veterinary samples harboring complex microbial communities. Detection sensitivity in the range of 0. 1 % has been demonstrated, far below the 5 % detection limit of traditional microbial diagnostic microarrays...|$|R
40|$|Mycobacterium simiae is a non-tuberculosis {{mycobacterium}} causing pulmonary {{infections in}} both immunocompetent and imunocompromized patients. We announce the draft genome sequence of M. simiae DSM 44165 T. The 5, 782, 968 -bp long genome with 65. 15 % GC con-tent (one chromosome, no plasmid) contains 5, 727 open reading frames (33 % with unknown function and 11 ORFs sizing {{more than 5000}} -bp), three rRNA operons, 52 tRNA, one 66 -bp tmRNA matching with tmRNA tags from <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium,</b> <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis,</b> Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium microti, Mycobacterium marinum, and Mycobacte-rium africanum and 389 DNA repetitive sequences. Comparing ORFs and size distribution between M. simiae and five other Mycobacterium species M. simiae clustered with M. abscessus and M. smegmatis. A 40 -kb prophage was predicted in addition to two prophage-like elements, 7 -kb and 18 -kb in size, but no mycobacteriophage was seen after the observa-tion of 106 M. simiae cells. Fifteen putative CRISPRs were found. Three genes were predicted to encode resistance to aminoglycosides, betalactams and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B. A total of 163 CAZYmes were annotated. M. simiae contains ESX- 1 to ESX- 5 genes encoding for a type-VII secretion system.

40|$|The {{study of}} tissue-derived Mycobacterium leprae {{provides}} insights to the immunopathology of leprosy and helps identify broad molecular features necessary for mycobacterial parasitism. A major membrane protein (MMP-II) of in vivo-derived M. leprae previously recognized (Hunter, S. W., B. Rivoire, V. Mehra, B. R. Bloom, and P. J. Brennan. 1990. J. Biol. Chem. 265 : 14065) was purified from extracts {{of the organism}} and partial amino acid sequence obtained. This information allowed recognition, within one of the cosmids that encompass the entire M. leprae genome, of a complete gene, bfr, encoding a protein of subunit size 18. 2 kD. The amino acid sequence deduced from the major membrane protein II (MMP-II) gene revealed considerable homology to several bacterioferritins. Analysis of the native protein demonstrated the iron content, absorption spectrum, and large native molecular mass (380 kD) of several known bacterioferritins. The ferroxidase-center residues typical of ferritins were conserved in the M. leprae product. Oligonucleotides derived from the amino acid sequence of M. leprae bacterioferritin enabled amplification {{of much of the}} MMP-II gene and the detection of homologous sequences in <b>Mycobacterium</b> paratuberculosis, <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium,</b> <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis,</b> Mycobacterium intracellulare, and Mycobacterium scrofulaceum.

Two Mycobacterium species and one subspecies that infect wildlife are important from a wildlife damage management perspective. <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium,</b> avian <b>tuberculosis,</b> is a ubiquitous and cosmopolitan disease of wild and domestic birds. Wild and domestic ruminants are host to M. avium paratuberculosis, also known as Johneâ€™s disease. Finally, Mycobaterium bovis, bovine tuberculosis, is primarily associated with domestic and wild bovines and ungulates, but also infects many other species of mammals. Eradicating these diseases from wildlife populations is very difficult if not impossible. Preventing spill-over into domestic livestock herds is also problematic. We review the Mycobacterial diseases in wildlife and discuss their implications to livestock and human health.

This study was conducted with the purpose of phylogenetic analysis of <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> par <b>tuberculosis</b> isolated from dairies in Tehran. In this study, DNA extraction was performed on 100 stool samples from Johne's disease infected cattle. Then using specific primers of gene IS 900, Nested PCR reactions was carried out and from the positive samples isolated, 14 cases were randomly selected and sent to Macro gene Company in Korea for sequencing. In this study, 28 samples from a total of 100 stool samples were positive for MAP. After sequencing, more than 99 % of the positive samples were similar with sequences in gene bank.

40|$|AbstractPathogenic Mycobacteria colonize host macrophages. Attachement {{of these}} organisms to macrophages is the {{preliminary}} step prior to {{invasion of the}} macrophages by the bacteria. Western blot confirmed that walls of <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> and <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> contain molecules which are immunologically related to mycotin, a lectin found in Mycobacterium smegmatis. We have demonstrated that the adherence of Mycobacteria to macrophages is significantly inhibited by anti-mycotin antibody or the mycotin-specific sugar, mannan. These observations suggest that prevention of the interaction of mycotin-related molecules on the surfaces of Mycobacteria with mannose-specific receptors on macrophages, offers an important approach for blocking attachment of pathogenic Mycobacteria to macrophages, thereby preventing infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} infect macrophages {{is a common}} {{characteristic}} shared among many mycobacterial species. <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium,</b> <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis,</b> and Mycobacterium kansasii enter macrophages, using the complement receptors CR 1, CR 3, CR 4, and the mannose receptor. To identify M. avium genes and host cell pathways involved in the bacterial uptake by macrophages, we screened a M. avium transposon mutant library for the inability to enter macrophages. Uptake-impaired clones were selected. Sequence of six M. avium clones identified one gene involved in glycopeptidolipid biosynthesis, one gene encoding the conserved membrane protein homologue to the M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis MAP 2446 c gene and four others belonging to the same region of the chromosome. Analysis of the chromosome region revealed a pathogenicity island inserted between two tRNA sequences with 58 % of G+C content versus 69 % in the M. avium genome. The region is unique for M. avium and is not present in M. tuberculosis or M. paratuberculosis. Although the mutants {{did not differ from}} the WT bacterium regarding the binding to macrophage cell membrane, analysis of macrophage proteins after 1 h infection revealed a deficiency in the mutant to phosphorylate certain proteins on uptake. To understand M. avium interaction with two evolutionarily distinct hosts, the mutants were evaluated for Acanthamoeba castellanii invasion. The defect in the ability of the mutants to invade both cells was highly similar, suggesting that M. avium might have evolved mechanisms that are used to enter amoebas and human macrophages...|$|R

Determination of the functions of these and other plasmids has been hampered by the lack of methods for genetic manipulation of M. avium. In this study, the region of pLR 7 capable of replication was identified and sequenced. Fragments of pLR 7 were cloned into a pUC 18 derivative carrying a kanamycin resistance marker and introduced into a plasmid-free M. avium strain by electroporation. The origin of replication was located on a 1. 8 -kb PvuII-to-SmaI fragment. An open reading frame encoding a putative Rep protein was identified. Two other open reading frames were identified in this region. A shuttle vector, pMB 351, was constructed with the pLR 7 origin of replication, pUC 18, and the kanamycin resistance gene from Tn 5.

Immediate identification of drug-resistant strains is crucial to administering appropriate treatment before the bacteria are allowed to spread. However, developing countries, which are most affected by drug resistance, are struggling to combat the disease without the facilities or funds for expensive diagnostics. Recent studies have emphasized the suitability of isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC) for the rapid detection of mycobacteria. In this study, we investigate its suitability for rapid and reliable M. tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing. Specifically, IMC was used to determine the MICs of three drugs, namely, isoniazid, ethambutol, and moxifloxacin, against three mycobacteria, namely, <b>Mycobacterium</b> smegmatis, <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium,</b> and <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis.</b> The Richards growth model was used to calculate growth parameters, namely, the maximum bacterial growth rate and the lag phase duration from integrated heat flow-versus-time results. For example, MICs of isoniazid, ethambutol, and moxifloxacin were determined to be 1. 00, 8. 00, and 0. 25 Î¼g/ml, respectively.

40|$|Despite the {{antimicrobial}} {{mechanisms of}} vertebrate phagocytes, mycobacteria can survive within the phagosomes of these cells. These organisms use various strategies to evade destruction, including inhibition of acidification of the phagosome and inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion. In contrast to mycobacteria, Coxiella burnetii, the etiologic agent of Q fever, inhabits a spacious acidified intracellular vacuole which {{is prone to}} fusion with other vacuoles of the host cell, including phagosomes containing mycobacteria. The Coxiella-infected cell thus provides a unique model for investigating the survival of mycobacteria in an acidified phagosome-like compartment. In the present study, murine bone marrow-derived macrophages were infected with either <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> or <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> and then coinfected with C. burnetii. We observed {{that the majority of}} phagocytosed mycobacteria colocalized to the C. burnetii-containing vacuole, which maintained its acidic properties. In coinfected macrophages, the growth of M. avium was not impaired following fusion with the acidified vacuole. In contrast, the growth rate of M. tuberculosis was reduced in acidified vacuoles. These results suggest that although both species of mycobacteria inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion, they may be differentially susceptible to the toxic effects of the acidic environment in the mature phagolysosome...|$|R

We report here that when fibroblasts take up live (but not killed) M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv, they develop greatly increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) whether the cell line is inherently sensitive to TNF or not. Ultrasonically disrupted M. tuberculosis also has this property.

The biological effect of EGF on mammalian cells is initiated by the binding to a specific receptor. Both <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> and <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> cause lung infections and localized or disseminated disease in both patients without AIDS and those with AIDS. Histopathologic studies show necrosis in the lung, liver, and splenic tissues of patients with disseminated mycobacterial infection. In the course of experiments to examine the effect of growth factors on macrophages, it was observed that M. <b>avium</b> and M. <b>tuberculosis</b> but not Mycobacterium smegmatis cultured in the presence of 5, 50, or 500 ng of EGF per ml grew significantly faster than mycobacteria cultured in the absence of EGF. 125 I-EGF was found to bind to M. <b>avium</b> and M. <b>tuberculosis,</b> and the binding was competitively inhibited by unlabeled EGF. A receptor for EGF was identified on mycobacteria. Incubation of mycobacteria with EGF prior to infection of macrophage monolayers resulted in faster bacterial growth within macrophages compared with that of mycobacteria not incubated with EGF. EGF-binding protein was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and subsequently the protein was purified and the N-terminal amino acids were sequenced.

It inhibits the polymerization of arabinan in the arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan of the mycobacterial cell wall. Recent studies have shown that arabinosyltransferases could be targets of EMB. These enzymes are encoded by the emb locus that was identified in Mycobacterium smegmatis, <b>Mycobacterium</b> leprae, <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium,</b> and <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>tuberculosis.</b> We demonstrate that a missense mutation in the M. smegmatis embB gene, one of the genes of the emb locus, confers resistance to EMB. The level of resistance is not dependent on the number of copies of the mutated embB gene, indicating that this is a true mechanism of resistance. The mutation is located in a region of the EmbB protein that is highly conserved among the different mycobacterial species. We also identified in this region two other independent mutations that confer EMB resistance. Furthermore, mutations have recently been described in the same region of the EmbB protein from clinical EMB-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates.

A resistant clone harboring a recombinant plasmid with a 3. 1 -kb insert that contained the glutamate decarboxylase (gadA) and D-alanine racemase (alrA) genes was identified. Subcloning experiments demonstrated that alrA was necessary and sufficient to confer a D-cycloserine resistance phenotype. The D-alanine racemase activities of wild-type and recombinant M. smegmatis strains were inhibited by D-cycloserine in a concentration-dependent manner. The D-cycloserine resistance phenotype in the recombinant clone {{was due to the}} overexpression of the wild-type alrA gene in a multicopy vector. Analysis of a spontaneous resistant mutant also demonstrated overproduction of wild-type AlrA enzyme. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the overproducing mutant revealed a single transversion (G 3 T) at the alrA promoter, which resulted in elevated b-galactosidase reporter gene expression. Furthermore, transformants of Mycobacterium intracellulare and Mycobacterium bovis BCG carrying the M. smegmatis wild-type alrA gene in a multicopy vector were resistant to D-cycloserine, suggesting that AlrA overproduction is a potential mechanism of D-cycloserine resistance in clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis and other pathogenic mycobacteria. In conclusion, these results show that one of the mechanisms of D-cycloserine resistance in M. smegmatis involves the overexpression of the alrA gene due to a promoter-up mutation...|$|R

In contrast, all four drugs had very low bactericidal activities against M. avium: the broth-determined MBCs were significantly higher than the Cmax. On a basis of comparisons with the broth-determined MICs found for susceptible M. tuberculosis strains and with the Cmax, about one-third of 100 M. avium strains tested can be tentatively considered as susceptible to three aminoglycosides (streptomycin, amikacin, and kanamycin) but not to capreomycin. In regard to the MBCs and MICs, the three aminoglycosides tested have about identical potentials as drugs of choice in combination with other drugs for chemotherapy of M. avium disease. The low bactericidal activities of these drugs against M. avium in vitro do not exclude their therapeutic usefulness, because they may produce a synergistic effect in combination with other drugs. Such an option is especially promising for patients whose isolates can be considered susceptible {{on the basis of the}} MIC.

Similarly, lung sections from silica-exposed mice had many more acid fast bacilli (AFB) organisms than from control mice. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) from bronchoalveolar lavage of silica-exposed mice also revealed a higher number of mycobacteria compared with mice treated with Al 2 O 3 or saline.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> {{subspecies}} paratuberculosis causes {{systemic infection}} and chronic intestinal inflammation in many species including primates. Humans are exposed through milk and from sources of environmental contamination. Hitherto, the only vaccines available against <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> subspecies paratuberculosis {{have been limited}} to veterinary use and comprised attenuated or killed organisms. METHODS: We developed a vaccine comprising a fusion construct designated HAV, containing components of two secreted and two cell surface <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> subspecies paratuberculosis proteins. HAV was transformed into DNA, human Adenovirus 5 (Ad 5) and Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) delivery vectors. Full length expression of the predicted 95 kDa fusion protein was confirmed. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Vaccination of naÃ¯ve and <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> subspecies paratuberculosis infected C 57 BL/ 6 mice using DNA-prime/MVA-boost or Ad 5 -prime/MVA-boost protocols was highly immunogenic resulting in significant IFN-gamma ELISPOT responses by splenocytes against recombinant vaccine antigens {{and a range of}} HAV specific peptides. This included strong recognition of a T-cell epitope GFAEINPIA located near the C-terminus of the fusion protein. Antibody responses to recombinant vaccine antigens and HAV specific peptides but not GFAEINPIA, also occurred. No immune recognition of vaccine antigens occurred in any sham vaccinated <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> subspecies paratuberculosis infected mice. Vaccination using either protocol significantly attenuated pre-existing <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> subspecies paratuberculosis infection measured by qPCR in spleen and liver and the Ad 5 -prime/MVA-boost protocol also conferred some protection against subsequent challenge. No adverse effects of vaccination occurred in any of the mice.

We have studied the role of IL- 12 and IL- 2 in the generation of Mycobacterium leprae-specific T cell responses in humans. Leprosy patients were defined as low/nonresponders or high responders based on the level of T cell proliferation in M. leprae-stimulated PBMC. In high responders, M. leprae-induced proliferation was markedly suppressed by neutralizing anti-IL- 12 mAb (inhibition 55 +/- 6 %). Neutralization of IL- 2 activity resulted in an inhibition of 77 +/- 4 %. Given the importance of endogenous IL- 2 and IL- 12 in M. leprae-induced responses, we investigated the ability of rIL- 2 and rIL- 12 to reverse T cell unresponsiveness in low/nonresponder patients. Interestingly, rIL- 12 and rIL- 2 strongly synergized in restoring both M. leprae-specific T cell proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion almost completely to the level of responder patients. A similar synergy between rIL- 2 and rIL- 12 was also observed in high responders when suboptimal M. leprae concentrations were used for T cell stimulation. Our data demonstrate a crucial role for endogenous IL- 12 and IL- 2 in M. leprae-induced T cell activation. Most importantly, we show that rIL- 2 and rIL- 12 act in synergy to overcome Ag-specific Th 1 cell unresponsiveness.

40|$|<b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> {{complex is}} a facultative {{intracellular}} pathogen {{that can cause}} pulmonary disease in immunocompromised individuals. Dendritic cells (DCs) {{play a central role}} in protective immunity against <b>mycobacteria.</b> <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> complex infects DCs but does not impair in vitro infected monocytes differentiation into DCs. A 54 -year old woman affected by chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD) was referred to our Division of Dermatology. Immature DCs were generated from her monocytes. One week later she was hospitalized due to a lung infection with <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> complex. Monocyte-derived DCs during <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> infection expressed low levels of CD 1 a and CD 80 as determined by flow cytometry. They also expressed high levels of CD 83 and CD 86, and when stimulated with LPS for 24 hrs they slightly up-regulated CD 83 and did not produce IL 12. When monocyte-derived DCs were obtained from the patient after having recovered from the <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> complex infection, they expressed normal levels of CD 1 a and CD 80 and were negative both for CD 83 and for CD 86. IL 12 production in response to LPS was restored. Inhibition of DC maturation by the in vivo infection with <b>Mycobacterium</b> <b>avium</b> may be an immune-evasion mechanism used by the pathogen because incompletely matured DCs may not activate effector T cells efficiently in vivo...|$|R
