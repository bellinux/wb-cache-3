500|$|I pop {{the video}} in, and wow... Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps... Wow. [...] I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn't mine anymore... It really made <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> how {{powerful}} music is {{as a medium}} and art form. I wrote some words and music in my bedroom {{as a way of}} staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone. [...] that winds up reinterpreted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning— different, but every bit as pure.|$|E
500|$|David Sims of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A, {{calling it a}} [...] "classic" [...] and writing that it [...] "is so damn clever in how it bonds Jerry's fears about social niceties with larger fears about mortality"; he also praised Louis-Dreyfus's acting, saying that Elaine [...] "has an amusingly stark little bit of {{dialogue}} about death midway through the episode: [...] "You know, funerals always make <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> my own mortality and how I'm actually going to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that!" [...] I think it's probably Louis-Dreyfus' best moment of the show so far, because she's really starting to nail Elaine's declarative, vaguely imperious, self-centered tone." [...] He also admired [...] "the estimable Barney Martin in his first appearance as Jerry's irascible dad." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Hill collaboratively {{wrote an}} autobiography, , with mountaineer and writer Greg Child, {{published}} by W.W. Norton & Company. As {{she describes the}} process, [...] "He would take my writings and organize them, and he encouraged me to elaborate on certain elements. He emphasized that telling the story is what's important, so he really helped <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> what I wanted to say, and figure out who my audience was." [...] Hill explained {{in an interview that}} writing about past events was easier because she had had time to reflect on them. She wanted to [...] "convey the history and culture of free climbing", specifically how it became as specialized as it is today. She felt that she had a unique perspective to offer, both as someone who climbed at a particular moment in climbing history and as a woman: [...] "And I wonder if a male writer would have presented that information differently. I think the book is important from that stand point , because I am a woman, and there are not many female viewpoints on climbing, or the history of climbing, out there." [...] Writing about climbing in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was dominated by men. As accomplished American climber and writer Rachel de Silva explains, the six major American climbing magazines published fewer than 12 articles a year by or about women during the 1980s despite women comprising 40% of climbers. It was not until 1990 that the first women-centric climbing books appeared.|$|E

Then, I decided I wanted to work again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Keaton {{has served}} as a {{producer}} on films and television series. She produced the Fox series Pasadena that was canceled after airing only four episodes in 2001 but later completed its run on cable in 2005. In 2003, she produced the Gus Van Sant drama Elephant, about a school shooting. On why she produced the film, she said [...] "It really makes <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> my responsibilities as an adult to try and understand what's going on with young people." ...|$|E

50|$|I {{never thought}} about that question. After Nebe {{told me that he}} had orders to kill the mental {{patients}} in his area, there was nothing for <b>me</b> to <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> After all, mental patients were also killed in the Reich.|$|R
2500|$|In the third-season finale, [...] "The Lunar Excitation", after Penny's failed {{attempts}} {{to move on}} from her relationship with Leonard, she becomes intoxicated and has sex with him. In the morning, Leonard believes that their relationship has resumed, though Penny tells him that the previous night was a mistake. This causes a strain on their friendship; {{at the end of}} the episode, Leonard becomes intoxicated and tries to have intercourse with her, prompting Penny to push him out of her apartment, to which Leonard suspects a double standard. He immediately makes the same advances towards Leslie Winkle, who replies, 'Let <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it" [...] and slams the door in his face.|$|E
2500|$|For the film, Lynch {{decided to}} include pop {{songs from the}} 1960s, {{including}} [...] "In Dreams" [...] by Roy Orbison and [...] "Blue Velvet" [...] by Bobby Vinton, the latter of which was largely inspirational for the film, with Lynch stating that [...] "It was the song that sparked the movie... There was something mysterious about it. It made <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> things. And the first things I thought about were lawns – lawns and the neighborhood." [...] Other music for the film was also produced, this time composed by Angelo Badalamenti, who {{would go on to}} produce the music for most of Lynch's subsequent cinematic works. Dino de Laurentiis loved the film, and it achieved support from some of the early specialist screenings, but the preview screenings to a mainstream audience were instead highly negative, with most of the audience hating the film. Although Lynch had found success previously with The Elephant Man, Blue Velvets controversy with audiences and critics introduced him into the mainstream, and it became a huge critical and moderate commercial success. The film earned Lynch his second Academy Award nomination for Best Director. Woody Allen, whose film Hannah and Her Sisters was nominated for Best Picture, said that Blue Velvet was his favorite film of the year.|$|E

6000|$|Marston pondered for {{a moment}} or two. [...] "Now I {{understand}} why the witches in Macbeth made <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the Bat; they tempted him with lying promises. But I'm not much of a philosopher and we have the Bat to reckon on. Peters doesn't count." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What made <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> Brooks {{was that}} she was awfully decent to me before Enton," [...] Molyneux continued. [...] "I don't mind telling you that I'm hard hit. I want to know who Brooks is. If he's only a country lawyer, he's got no earthly chance with Lady Caroom, and Sybil'd never go against her mother. They're too great pals for that. Never saw them so thick." ...|$|E
6000|$|Halleck {{struck the}} arms of his chair with his {{clinched}} hands. [...] "Confound the fellow! What business has he to come back into my way, and make <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> his wife? Oh, very likely it's quite as you say! I dare say she's stupidly content with him; that she's forgiven it and forgotten all about it. Probably she's told him how I behaved, and they've laughed me over together. But does that make it any easier to bear?" ...|$|E

5000|$|... “To me, {{performance}} {{studies is}} a discipline that {{enables you to}} radically contextualize how we <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the production of culture and, as a black feminist scholar it enables <b>me</b> to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> {{the body and the}} corporeal as being central to our understanding of cultural production. So, what is performance studies? It’s thinking about embodiment as somehow enriching our understanding of text”.|$|R

6000|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it," [...] I parried, and To-jo {{said that}} he would wait until night. He would give me a day to think it over; then he left, and the women left--the men for the hunt, and the women, as I later learned from So-ta, for the warm pool where they {{immersed}} their bodies as did the shes of the Sto-lu. [...] "Ata," [...] explained So-ta, when I questioned her as to the purpose of this matutinal rite; but that was later.|$|E
60|$|I {{meant to}} have written you a long letter, but I cannot write very fast when I like the person I am writing to, because that makes <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> them, and I like you, and so I tell you. Besides, {{it is just}} eight o'clock at night, and I always {{go to bed at}} eight o'clock, except when it is my birthday, and then I sit up to supper. So I will not say {{anything}} more besides this--and that is my love to you and Neptune; and if you will drink my health every Christmas Day I will drink yours--come.|$|E
60|$|It {{is a most}} {{remarkable}} thing. I {{sat down with the}} full intention of writing something clever and original; but {{for the life of me}} I can't think of anything clever and original--at least, not at this moment. The only thing I can think about now is being hard up. I suppose having my hands in my pockets has made <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> this. I always do sit with my hands in my pockets except when I am in the company of my sisters, my cousins, or my aunts; and they kick up such a shindy--I should say expostulate so eloquently upon the subject--that I have to give in and take them out--my hands I mean. The chorus to their objections is that it is not gentlemanly. I am hanged if I can see why. I could understand its not being considered gentlemanly to put your hands in other people's pockets (especially by the other people), but how, O ye sticklers for what looks this and what looks that, can putting his hands in his own pockets make a man less gentle? Perhaps you are right, though. Now I come to think of it, I have heard some people grumble most savagely when doing it. But they were mostly old gentlemen. We young fellows, as a rule, are never quite at ease unless we have our hands in our pockets. We are awkward and shifty. We are like what a music-hall Lion Comique would be without his opera-hat, if such a thing can be imagined. But let us put our hands in our trousers pockets, and let there be some small change in the right-hand one and a bunch of keys in the left, and we will face a female post-office clerk.|$|E
