5|$|Based on its composition, it {{is assumed}} that the magma at Licancabur formed from the partial melting of the oceanic crust subducted at the Peru-Chile Trench after metamorphosis. This magma melted part of the mantle wedge above the subducting plate, <b>mixing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> melt products. Further {{contamination}} by crustal Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite-like rocks from the Archean, crystal fractionation and magma mixing further up in the crust then yielded the Licancabur magmas. The younger lavas may have formed from the mixing of dacite with the magmas forming the older lavas. Some inclusions in Licancabur rocks seem to be from wall rocks of the magma chamber.|$|E
5|$|The {{bombing was}} planned and {{performed}} by two Vietcong agents who escaped uninjured and were never captured. Nguyen Thanh Xuan recollected his involvement to historian Stanley Karnow {{after the war}} had ended. In late-November, Xuan and his comrade received orders from a Vietcong intermediary to bomb the Brinks Hotel. The building housed United States Army officers, including lieutenant colonels and majors, and attracted off-duty personnel with its highly regarded food and drink, rooftop seating areas and movie screenings. It was a six-story building and had 193bedrooms. The Vietcong duo observed their target over the next month, <b>mixing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> crowds in the busy street outside. Noting that South Vietnamese officers mingled freely with Americans, they obtained ARVN uniforms from Saigon's black market, enabling them to get closer. Xuan disguised himself as a military chauffeur, while his partner dressed as a South Vietnamese major. They mingled with the real officers {{so that they could}} copy their mannerisms, speaking style and even their way of smoking. The Vietcong pair then procured the two cars and explosives needed for the operation.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{advancement}} of modern medicine, acute kidney injury {{was referred to as}} uremic poisoning while uremia was contamination of the blood with urine.

This Isleño material relates {{not only to the}} Canary Islands, but also to several other regions of Spain and perhaps Portugal, as immigrants from these places have been coming to Louisiana since the 19th century and <b>mixing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Isleño communities.|$|E
25|$|Americans of English {{descent and}} Scots-Irish descent began moving into {{northern}} Florida from the backwoods of Georgia and South Carolina.

Stinger is a 6-foot 9inch bright green bug that walks amongst the crowd during the games and skates on the ice between periods while wearing a Blue Jackets' jersey. Stinger was originally yellow, but was changed to green, eventually <b>mixing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> team's blue. The image of Stinger was on the original Blue Jackets' jerseys, eventually being removed in 2003. The team also had another mascot, an anthropomorphic cannon named Boomer, for half of the 2010–11 season.|$|E
25|$|Tungsten hexafluoride is an {{extremely}} corrosive compound that attacks any tissue. Exposure of humans to the gas first affects the eyes and respiratory tracts causing irritation, loss of vision, cough, and excessive formation of saliva and sputum. Upon <b>mixing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> body fluids, the gas transforms into hydrofluoric acid which burns the skin and mucous tissues of the respiratory tract. Upon prolonged exposure, this results in pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, and could be fatal. Because {{of the formation of}} hydrofluoric acid upon reaction of WF6 with humidity, WF6 storage vessels have Teflon gaskets.|$|E

25|$|To {{clean the}} filter, water is passed quickly upward through the filter, {{opposite}} the normal direction (called backflushing or backwashing) to remove embedded or unwanted particles. Prior to this step, compressed air may be blown {{up through the}} bottom of the filter to break up the compacted filter media to aid the backwashing process; this is known as air scouring. This contaminated water can be disposed of, along with the sludge from the sedimentation basin, or it can be recycled by <b>mixing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> raw water entering the plant although this is often considered poor practice since it re-introduces an elevated concentration of bacteria into the raw water.|$|E
25|$|Previously some {{archeologist}} {{considered the}} Bell-beaker {{people to have}} lived only within a limited territory of the Carpathian Basin and for a short time, without <b>mixing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> local population. Although {{there are very few}} evaluable anthropological finds, the appearance of the characteristic planoccipital (flattened back) Taurid type in the populations of some later cultures (e.g. Kisapostag and Gáta–Wieselburg cultures) suggested a mixture with the local population contradicting such archaeological theories. According to archaeology, the populational groups of the Bell-beakers also took part {{in the formation of the}} Gáta-Wieselburg culture on the western fringes of the Carpathian Basin, which could be confirmed with the anthropological Bell Beaker series in Moravia and Germany.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of the Anglo-Saxon period in the fifth century CE, the area that became Kent {{underwent}} a radical transformation on a political, social, and physical level. In the preceding era of Roman Britain, the area had been administered as the civitas of Cantiaci, a part of the Roman Empire, but following the collapse of Roman rule in 410 CE, many signs of Romano-British society began to disappear, replaced by those of the ascendant Anglo-Saxon culture. Later Anglo-Saxon accounts attribute this change to the widescale invasion of Germanic language tribes from northern Europe, namely the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. Archaeological and toponymic evidence shows that {{there was a great deal}} of syncretism, with Anglo-Saxon culture interacting and <b>mixing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Romano-British culture.|$|E

25|$|During the 1990s Eno became {{increasingly}} interested in self-generating musical systems, {{the results of}} which he called generative music. The basic premise of generative music is the blending of several independent musical tracks, of varying sounds, length, and in some cases, silence. When each individual track concludes, it starts again <b>mixing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other tracks allowing the listener to hear an almost infinite combination. In one instance of generative music, Eno calculated {{that it would take}} almost 10,000 years to hear the entire possibilities of one individual piece. He has presented this music in his own, and other artists', art and sound installations, most notably I Dormienti (The Sleepers), , Music for Civic Recovery Centre, The Quiet Room and Music for Prague.|$|E
25|$|The Phoenicians were Mediterranean seamen in {{constant}} search for valuable metals such as copper, gold, tin, and lead. They began to populate the North African coast with settlementstrading and <b>mixing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> native Berber population. In 814 BC, Phoenicians from Tyre established {{the city of}} Carthage. By 600 BC, Carthage had become a major trading entity and power in the Mediterranean, largely through trade with tropical Africa. Carthage's prosperity fostered {{the growth of the}} Berber kingdoms, Numidia and Mauretania. Around 500 BC, Carthage provided a strong impetus for trade with Sub-Saharan Africa. Berber middlemen, who had maintained contacts with Sub-Saharan Africa since the desert had desiccated, utilized pack animals to transfer products from oasis to oasis. Danger lurked from the Garamantes of Fez, who raided caravans. Salt and metal goods were traded for gold, slaves, beads, and ivory.|$|E
25|$|Growing algae as {{a source}} of biofuel has also been shown to have {{numerous}} environmental benefits, and has presented itself as a much more environmentally friendly alternative to current biofuels. For one, it is able to utilize run-off, water contaminated with fertilizers and other nutrients that are a by-product of farming, as its primary source of water and nutrients. Because of this, it prevents this contaminated water from <b>mixing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lakes and rivers that currently supply our drinking water. In addition to this, the ammonia, nitrates, and phosphates that would normally render the water unsafe actually serve as excellent nutrients for the algae, meaning that fewer resources are needed to grow the algae. Many algae species used in biodiesel production are excellent bio-fixers, meaning they are able to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to use as a form of energy for themselves. Because of this, they have found use in industry as a way to treat flue gases and reduce GHG emissions.|$|E
