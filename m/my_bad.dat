500|$|In 1988, Love aborted {{her acting}} career and left New York, {{returning}} to the West Coast, citing the [...] "celebutante" [...] fame she'd attained as the central reason. She returned to stripping {{in the small town}} of McMinnville, Oregon, where she was recognized by customers at the bar. This prompted Love to go into isolation, so she relocated to Anchorage, Alaska, where she lived for three months to [...] "gather her thoughts," [...] supporting herself by working at a strip club frequented by local fishermen. [...] "I decided to move to Alaska because I needed to get my shit together and learn how to work", she said in retrospect. [...] "So I went on this sort of vision quest. I got rid of all my earthly possessions. I had <b>my</b> <b>bad</b> little strip clothes and some big sweaters, and I moved into a trailer with a bunch of other strippers." ...|$|E

2500|$|In For Love Not Money former Australian flanker Simon Poidevin recalls that, [...] "Campo made {{a sensational}} midfield break, gave {{to me and}} [...] Burke loomed up {{alongside}} me with their fullback Hugo MacNeill the only guy to beat. Burke was on my right, <b>my</b> <b>bad</b> passing side, and as I drew MacNeill I somehow threw the ball forward to him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Josephine thought Johnny’s {{marriage}} {{proposal was}} a good excuse to leave home again. She wrote, [...] "life was dull for me in San Francisco. In spite of <b>my</b> <b>bad</b> experience {{of a few years}} ago the call to adventure still stirred my blood." [...] Considering that Josephine reported in later life at having first arrived with the Markham Troupe on December 1, 1879, and that Josephine joined Behan in Tombstone that same year, her reference to [...] "my bad experience of a few years ago" [...] means she must have been in Arizona for some time before 1879.|$|E
2500|$|Vyjayanthimala {{commented that}} [...] "his {{death is a}} big loss to the industry. It's <b>my</b> <b>bad</b> luck that I didn't {{have the chance to}} work with him because he came much later. I {{remember}} when he came to Chennai for some film shoot, the college girls went crazy {{to catch a glimpse of}} him when he was going to his studio." [...] Manna Dey said: [...] "He was a great actor, truly a superstar, no doubt about it. I am honoured to have done playback for him. I have worked for him in several movies, and actors like him are a rarity." [...] Mrinal Sen recollected how Khanna had wanted to cast him in one of his films, but the latter could not manage due to date problems. [...] "We had met several times. Once I had wanted to cast him in one of my films, but somehow that didn't work out due to his date problems." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wallis was keen to {{join the}} RAF, and applied for their Volunteer Reserve Service, but he was turned down due to a {{defective}} right eye. Consequently, he obtained a private flying licence which required only a certificate signed by his GP. Wallis obtained his A Licence for dual and solo flying in a record 12 hours. In 1938, Wallis tried {{to join the}} RAF again, {{this time with the}} newly formed RAF Short Service Commission Scheme, but again failed the eye test. In 1939, he was called up to RAF Uxbridge, and again was sent for a medical. When it came to the eyesight test he managed to pass, as Wallis later recalled, [...] "I did the first line with my good eye then they covered it up and asked me to read the bottom line with <b>my</b> <b>bad</b> eye, without them realising I just turned my head slightly so I could again see with my good eye – I passed it with Above Average Eye Sight!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Complexity. Doubts were {{expressed}} as to workability of FATCA {{due to its}} complexity, and the legislative timetable for implementation was pushed back multiple times. According to U.S. national taxpayer advocate Nina Olsen in regards to FATCA: [...] "This {{is a piece of}} legislation that is so big and so far-reaching, and [...] so many different moving pieces, and is rolling out in an incremental fashion (...) that you really won’t be able to know what its consequences are, intended or otherwise,’ Olson said. [...] "I don’t think we’ll know that for years. And by that point we’ll actually be a little too late to go, [...] "Oops, <b>my</b> <b>bad,</b> we shouldn’t have done this,’ and then try to unwind it." [...] Bloomberg reported in 2015 that the IRS help center is not able to provide adequate taxpayer customer service. In 2016, the Taxpayer Advocate reported that [...] "FATCA implementation has created significant compliance burdens and risk exposures" [...] for overseas Americans, and its [...] "heavy-handed approach, especially when combined with the complexity surrounding IRS requirements, has negative consequences, both for FFIs and the IRS".|$|E
2500|$|The 2nd Test match {{witnessed}} many controversial umpiring decisions {{from the}} two umpires - Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson and even the third Umpire. Three of Steve Bucknor's gaffes occurred {{when he did not}} give Andrew Symonds out caught behind at 30 when TV Replays clearly showed that the ball had passed through the bat's edge. The second one occurred when Bucknor did not refer a stumping call against Andrew Symonds to the third umpire. Replays showed the Australia all-rounder’s foot wasn't grounded inside the crease when the bails came off. This was a major boost for Australia as Symonds went on to make 162 not out and brought Australia back into the Game. After these incidents, Andrew Symonds said, [...] "I was very lucky. I was out when I was 30, given not out. That's cricket though, I can sit here and tell you about <b>my</b> <b>bad</b> decisions as well - but I won't." [...] On the fifth day, Bucknor declared Rahul Dravid out caught behind though television replays later showed the ball had brushed his pad without touching his bat.|$|E
