25|$|Between 1936 and 1938, {{three very}} large Moscow Trials of former senior Communist Party leaders were held, {{in which they}} were accused of conspiring with fascist and {{capitalist}} powers to assassinate Stalin and other Soviet leaders, dismember the Soviet Union and restore capitalism. These trials were highly publicized and extensively covered by the outside world, which was <b>mesmerized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> spectacle of Lenin's closest associates confessing to most outrageous crimes and begging for death sentences.|$|E

Ian retreats from {{domestic}} life, preferring to write poetry in solitude. On June 4, 1976 they attend a Sex Pistols concert with Bernard Sumner (James Anthony Pearson), Peter Hook (Joe Anderson), and Terry Mason (Andrew Sheridan), who are starting a band. <b>Mesmerized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> concert, Ian volunteers to be their singer.

The band debuts 19 May 1977 and soon rename themselves Joy Division. Ian and Debbie finance their first EP, An Ideal for Living (1978).|$|E

500|$|One day Shantanu, the Kuru king of Hastinapur, came to {{the forest}} on a hunting trip and was <b>mesmerized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> musk-fragrance emanating from Satyavati. Allured by her sweet scent, Shantanu reached Satyavati's house and, seeing her, fell in love at first sight.

500|$|The {{magazine}} Screen {{called the}} film [...] "a brilliantly made entertainer". Dina Thanthi wrote [...] "Not {{one would not}} have been <b>mesmerized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Thillana" [...] dance sequence". The British newspaper Daily Mail said Thillana Mohanambal is [...] "a feast to the eyes and ears". Subhashini Pathmanathan of Daily News Sri Lanka praised the film's dance and music sequences. Tamil Canadian journalist D. B. S. Jeyaraj wrote for Daily FT that Ganesan's [...] "...duel over artistic superiority with Padmini, particularly during the 'Nalanthaana?' song sequence" [...] was a scene that [...] "remains etched in [...] memory".|$|E
500|$|Eric Lenneberg, Noam Chomsky, and Steven Pinker {{have also}} criticized Whorf {{for failing to}} be {{sufficiently}} clear in his formulation of how language influences thought, and for failing to provide real evidence to support his assumptions. Generally Whorf's arguments {{took the form of}} examples that were anecdotal or speculative, and functioned as attempts to show how [...] "exotic" [...] grammatical traits were connected to what were considered equally exotic worlds of thought. Even Whorf's defenders admitted that his writing style was often convoluted and couched in neologisms– attributed to his awareness of language use, and his reluctance to use terminology that might have pre-existing connotations. [...] argues that Whorf was <b>mesmerized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> foreignness of indigenous languages, and exaggerated and idealized them. According to Lakoff, Whorf's tendency to exoticize data must be judged in the historical context: Whorf and the other Boasians wrote at a time in which racism and jingoism were predominant, and when it was unthinkable to many that [...] "savages" [...] had redeeming qualities, or that their languages were comparable in complexity to those of Europe. For this alone Lakoff argues, Whorf can be considered to be [...] "Not just a pioneer in linguistics, but a pioneer as a human being".|$|E

2500|$|According to Corrales and Penfold, [...] "Chávez was not {{the first}} {{president}} in Venezuelan history to be <b>mesmerized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> promise of oil, but {{he was the one who}} allowed the sector to decline the most", with most statistics showing deterioration of the industry since the beginning of his presidency.|$|E
2500|$|He {{accuses the}} governmental, medical and press establishments of foot-dragging in combating the disease—especially {{in the early}} days of its outbreak, when much of the play is set—and he is even tougher on {{homosexual}} leaders who, in his view, were either too cowardly or too <b>mesmerized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ideology of sexual liberation to get the story out. [...] "There's not a good word to be said about anyone's behavior in this whole mess", claims one character—and certainly Mr. Kramer has few good words to say about Mayor Koch, various prominent medical organizations, The New York Times or, for that matter, most of the leadership of an unnamed organization apparently patterned after the Gay Men's Health Crisis.|$|E

Broadcast Music, Inc. stated [...] "music lovers continue to be <b>mesmerized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> talented [...] "Miss Janet," [...] being an [...] "impressive demonstration of her enduring appeal." [...] "Doesn't Really Matter" [...] was ineligible for an Academy Award nomination due to being used throughout the film and during its credits, also released when {{emphasis was placed on}} songs used in animated films. The song was included on compilations such as Now That's What I Call Music! 5, and featured on Jackson's hits album Number Ones.|$|E
5000|$|While {{contradictions in}} {{continuity}} {{are to be}} expected in science fiction and fantasy franchises with established histories such as Star Trek, Stoklasa stated that it is virtually impossible for writers working in those franchises to write viable stories that avoid such contradictions entirely. While he does focus on such gaffes for material in his reviews, he states that what truly irritates him is sloppy writing, in particular writing that exhibits traits such as poor character motivation, lapses in common sense or questionable logic, in order to advance the film's plot. He cited the Star Wars prequels as an example, saying: [...] "You're <b>mesmerized</b> <b>by</b> all <b>the</b> visuals and excitement on screen, but if you really stop and listen you'll realize that almost every line and every action makes no sense and is just there to get to the next special effects scene." ...|$|R

Later in act 4, the sultan meets Almyna, and when she is unveiled before him, he confesses that he is taken back by her beauty: [...] "Her glistering Eyes, like Lightning flash thro' mine. / All-seeing, all-commanding; how they pierce me?" [...] Although he is <b>mesmerized</b> <b>by</b> Almyna, <b>the</b> sultan reminds her that he will not veer from his murdering, and asks that she consider this before she decides to marry him.

2500|$|Initially, Lehwaldt's force {{retained}} some {{advantage in}} the battle. [...] The fierce Prussian assault prevented the Russians from forming the traditional squares with which to repel cavalry, {{but they did not}} break and run. Furthermore, observers reported that the main force of Prussians advancing on the center fired volley upon volley with their usual ruthless efficiency. Russian army recovered from the shock of the initial assault and counter-attacked. Initially <b>mesmerized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Prussian onslaught, the Russians recovered to shoot back; their return fire was not of the same efficiency, but it was nevertheless effective and the Prussian line eventually collapsed under it. [...] Furthermore, the Kalmyk cavalry and the Don Cossacks, on the Prussian left, pretended to retreat so as to trap the attacking Prussians under heavy artillery fire. [...] This was an effort by Apraksin to encircle the Prussians with his larger army, which Lehwaldt was able to avoid.|$|E
2500|$|Winston {{works at}} the Ministry of Truth, or [...] "Minitrue", as an editor. He is {{responsible}} for historical negationism; he rewrites records and alters photographs {{to conform to the}} state's ever-changing version of history itself, rendering the deleted people [...] "unpersons"; the original documents are destroyed by fire in a [...] "memory hole". At work, he re-writes a Times article reporting on a government official condemned as a thoughtcriminal by writing a story on a nonexistent war hero named [...] "Comrade Ogilvy", and notes the state-sponsored media reporting an increase in the chocolate ration during an actual decrease. Despite his proficiency in his profession, Winston becomes <b>mesmerized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> true past after seeing a photograph of three former high-ranking upper class Inner Party officials in New York, discounting the official government account that they had been collaborating with Eurasian officials. Winston tries to get more information about the true past, and purchases an old journal in an antiques shop in a proletarian neighborhood of London. In a place beside his flat's telescreen where he believes he cannot be seen, he begins writing a journal criticizing the Party and its enigmatic leader, Big Brother. By doing so, he commits a crime that, if discovered by the Thought Police, warrants certain death, and Winston quickly resigns himself {{to the fact that he}} will eventually be arrested for thoughtcrime. In the journal, he records his sexual frustration over a young woman maintaining the novel-writing machines at the ministry named Julia, whom Winston is attracted to but suspects is an informant. He also suspects that his superior, an Inner Party official named O'Brien, is a secret agent for an enigmatic underground resistance movement known as the Brotherhood, a group formed by Big Brother's reviled political rival Emmanuel Goldstein.|$|E

500|$|Frederick had {{benefited from}} an obliging enemy. First, Charles {{saw what he}} wanted to see {{regarding}} the principal attack instead of using his efficient light cavalry {{to figure out what the}} Prussians really intended. Frederick commented later that a lone patrol could have uncovered the truth. The cavalry he had left demonstrating in front of the northernmost position of the Austrian line was simply a screen, a diversion, to hide his real movements. Second, the Austrians obliged him by their failure to post pickets on their unprotected flank south of Leuthen. Nádasdy's omission of outposts on his open flank south of Leuthen was a surprising failure for a man with his long years of experience against the Prussians; he should have considered the possibility of an attack from an unexpected direction because this was Frederick's modus operandi. [...] Third, even when confronted with the attack on his left, the diversion on the right flank near Frobelwitz continued to <b>mesmerize</b> Charles. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> time the Prince moved cavalry to support the faltering troops south of, and in, Leuthen, they had too far to travel in too little time.|$|R
5000|$|As per {{historical}} references, Kalahambir, {{the king}} of SURYA dynasty (Suryavansi) ruled Bissam cuttack and Devi Maa Markama was the Ishtadevi of the royal family.

Yet the ritual of buffalo sacrifice continued, which was stopped <b>by</b> <b>the</b> then Regional officer Shri Gadhadhar Mishro(01.07.1953-19.03.1955). The mention of Devi Maa Markama {{can also be found}} in the CHANDI PURANA of Sarala Dash and also in BATA ABAKASH of Matta Balarama Dash.

[...] CraveOnline's William Bibbiani called the episode [...] "an odd duck". After citing Jamie's early revelation as [...] "melodramatic silliness", Bibbiani added: [...] "The rest of the episode gets its job done, with one major, glaring flaw. The characters end up more or less {{where they need to}} be, but some nearly ridiculous loose ends remain." [...] Brandon Nowalk of The A.V. Club rated this episode a C-, calling it [...] "so unconvincing", adding [...] "I couldn't believe how little all this resolution affected me after The Killing so thrillingly took my grudging engagement for a ride a few weeks ago. This is the same show that delivered Richmond’s hospital nightmare, the hunt for Holder, the anti-Western standoff [...] "Sayonara, Hiawatha", and the crazy train of the last two weeks?
