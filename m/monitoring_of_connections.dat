40|$|Memory {{maintenance}} {{is widely believed}} to involve longterm retention of the synaptic weights that are set within relevant neural circuits during learning. However, despite recent exciting technical advances, {{it has not yet}} proved possible to confirm experimentally this intuitively appealing hypothesis. Artificial neural networks offer an alternative methodology as they permit continuous <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>connection</b> weights during learning and retention. In such models, ongoing alterations in connection weights are required if a network is to retain previously stored material while learning new information. Thus, the duration of synaptic change does not necessarily define the persistence of a memory; rather, it is likely that a regulated balance of synaptic stability and synaptic plasticity is required for optimal memory retention in real neuronal circuits...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the area}} <b>of</b> network <b>monitoring</b> a lot <b>of</b> tools are already {{available}} to measure {{a variety of}} metrics. However, these tools are often limited to a single administrative domain so that no established methodology for the <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> network <b>connections</b> spanning over multiple domains currently exists. In addition, these tools only monitor the network from a technical point of view without providing meaningful network performance indicators for different user groups. These indicators should be derived from the measured basic metrics. In this paper a Service Oriented Architecture is presented which is able to perform multi-domain measurements without being limited to specific kinds of metrics. A Service Oriented Architecture has been chosen as it allows for increased flexibility and scalability in comparison to traditional software engineering techniques.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of a vibration-based damage identification approach for impact damage in two advanced composite skin-stiffener structures is investigated in this paper.

The performance of a 1 D and 2 D formulation of the MSE-DI algorithm is compared for several damage scenarios.

40|$|Connections between {{structural}} members are critical elements that typically govern {{the performance of}} structural systems; hence, techniques for <b>monitoring</b> the condition <b>of</b> <b>connections</b> are needed to provide early warning of structural damage. Plastic hinge formation in fasteners frequently occurs in timber connections when the yield capacity is exceeded. An innovative pulse echo testing technique was developed for detecting {{the formation of a}} plastic hinge in bolted timber connections and estimating the associated magnitude <b>of</b> <b>connection</b> displacement. A shift in overall signal centroid proved to be the best flTedictor of plastic hinge formation, with a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 9. As the plastic hinge angle increased, the signal centroid shifted to the right since a higher proportion of pulse energy was forced to undergo multiple transverse wave reflections caused by the deformed geometry of the bolt. Because the determination of a shift in signal centroid requires the availability of prior test information for the initially undeformed fastener, an alternate linear relationship between echo amplitude ratios and plastic hinge formation was also proposed with an adjusted R 2 of 0. 87. This three parameter regression equation had the advantages of requiring no prior testing information and eliminating ambiguity in signal analysis associated with selection of echo start and end points. Plastic hinge formation was correlated with <b>connection</b> ductility, magnitude <b>of</b> <b>connection</b> overload and energy based measures <b>of</b> <b>connection</b> damage to assess residual connection capacity...|$|R
