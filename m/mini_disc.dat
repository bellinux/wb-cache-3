5000|$|Shaped CDs are {{produced}} {{in one of}} two ways. A special mold can be made and used to [...] "stamp" [...] CDs (or DVDs) as part of the precision injection molding process that is used to make CDs and DVDs. Because of the initial cost involved in setting up this process, it is usually used for mass production. For the same reason, this is generally restricted to the production of read only CDs and DVDs (CD-rom or DVD-rom). Recordable CDs and DVDs (CD-r or DVD-r or DVD+r) are not generally available except in standard shapes including rectangular. The second method to produce a shaped CD or DVD is to produce a normal CD-rom or DVD-rom and cut it to the desired shape. This method works only for CD-rom. It will not work for CD-r because the plastic used to produce CD-r tends to splinter when cut. It is important that two criteria be met for shaped disk to function properly. First, the shape must be balanced to avoid problems when it begins to spin. Second, at least three points of the outer edge must touch either the outer 12 cm diameter rim of the players tray where standard size discs fit or the inner rim where 8 cm diameter <b>mini</b> <b>discs</b> fit.|$|R
40|$|The root lesion {{nematode}} Pratylenchus thornei and the cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii {{belong to the}} top three plant parasitic nematode groups with regards to scientific and economic importance. RNA interference (RNAi) technology is a potential strategy for delivering transgenic resistance for nematode management in agriculture. The natural cellular mechanism of gene silencing, RNAi, is a sequence specific mRNA degradation process induced {{by the presence of}} double stranded RNA (dsRNA). The aim of this research was to investigate whether genes involved in cis and trans-splicing of mRNA in plant parasitic nematodes present suitable targets for nematode control using RNAi. In plant parasitic nematodes, RNAi was induced either through ingestion of dsRNA of genes involved in splicing {{with the help of a}} neurostimulant or via in planta delivery. Comparative analysis with Caenorhabditis elegans identified 55 spliceosome genes in the root {{lesion nematode}}s P. thornei, P. zeae and P. coffeae and 44 genes in the cyst nematodes H. glycines and H. schachtii. Identification of spliced leader (SL) RNA specific sut- 1, sut- 2, sna- 1 and sna- 2 genes suggests the occurrence of SL trans-splicing of mRNA in these nematodes. In vitro RNAi induced by soaking mixed stages of P. thornei and second stage juveniles of H. schachtii in 1 mg/mL dsRNA for selected spliceosome genes for 16 hours in some cases affected nematode movement causing paralysis, ‘knots’ and loss of direction, compared to those fed with dsRNA of green fluorescent protein (gfp) or controls not exposed to dsRNA. When dsRNA treated nematodes were transferred to carrot <b>mini</b> <b>discs</b> or Arabidopsis thaliana plants, after 5 weeks compared to control treatments there was a 55 - 99 % reduction in the number of RNAi-treated P. thornei cultured on the carrot <b>mini</b> <b>discs,</b> and a 9 - 81 % reduction in the number of H. schachtii cysts which developed on wild type A. thaliana, demonstrating that silencing of specific target genes reduced nematode survival and reproduction for both species. Reduction in transcript levels of some genes was also evident when analysed by semi-quantitative PCR. When carrot hairy roots were generated which expressed sequences of dsRNA for SL specific genes of P. thornei, there was a wide variation in the number of nematodes extracted per gram root, between different transgenic events. H. schachtii cyst development over 5 weeks was reduced by 3 - 100 % on transgenic A. thaliana plants transformed to express dsRNA of target 8 genes. The results suggest that some of the target genes studied are potential candidates for further development of nematode resistance in crop plants, and could contribute to the on-going search for delivering sustainable control of these and related nematodes using RNAi technology...|$|R

With cello, mandolin, acoustic guitar, his fantastic voice and a bank of pedals, he creates soundscapes which twist and bend through folk, drone metal and electronica." [...] Further years of writing and recording led to an increase in interest and a new record deal with the All Tomorrow's Parties affiliated ATP Recordings label, for whom he released Old Fog in 2005. One reviewer wrote of the LP that [...] "his beautifully spooked wanderings feature both delicately picked banjo and acoustic guitar, violin, piano, detuned electric guitar, found sounds, looped noise and ghostly vocals, all layered to eerily resonant effect. A wintry and wonderful new discovery", whilst another wrote that it was [...] "The kind of fog you won't mind getting lost in....a beautiful listen."

[...] Both of his first two albums were recorded on a digital 8-track when Tucker lived in a flat above Warren St. tube station, and the vibrations from passing tube trains can be heard in the background of some tracks.|$|E
40|$|Steel roller discs are an {{efficient}} mechanical tool for cutting soft to medium strength rocks in both civil and mining projects. However, their application for hard rock cutting has been hindered since steel discs wear quickly and fail prematurely {{due to high}} concentrated stresses generated at the sharp corners and thin elements of the disc. To overcome this problem, the current generation roller discs comprises a steel shaft connected to a tungsten carbide (WC) disc. In other words, while the material of the disc itself {{is replaced by a}} stronger WC material, steel continues to be used for the shaft body. In this paper, to comprehend the influence of material parameters on the induced stresses inside different parts of a roller cutter, an analytical closed-form solution and a series of finite element (FEM) numerical studies are performed. By considering the problem as a traction boundary-value problem in an elastic domain, the analytical solution is based on the Airy stress formulation in Cartesian coordinates with a Fourier series representing the boundary conditions. The analytical result is developed for both plane stress and plane strain conditions, encompassing all possible loading con?gurations and shaft geometries. To verify the numerical models, these results are also compared with laboratory experimental data obtained from cutting granite using <b>mini</b> <b>discs</b> for the penetration range 1 to 3 mm...|$|R

40|$|Root lesion {{nematodes}} (RLNs, Pratylenchus species) are a {{group of}} economically important migratory endoparasitic plant pathogens that attack host roots of major crops such as wheat and sugarcane, and can reduce crop yields by 7 - 15 %. Pratylenchus thornei and Pratylenchus zeae were treated with double stranded RNA (dsRNA) to study gene silencing, (RNA interference, RNAi), as a potential strategy for their control. Mixed stages of nematodes of both species ingested dsRNA when incubated in a basic soaking solution {{in the presence of}} the neurostimulant octopamine. Incubation for up to 16. h in soaking solutions containing 10 - 50. mM octopamine, 0. 1 - 1. 0. mg/mL FITC, and 0. 5 - 6. mM spermidine did not affect vitality. Spermidine phosphate salt hexahydrate rather than spermidine or spermidine trihydrochloride increased uptake of FITC by nematodes, and this resulted in more effective gene silencing. Silencing pat- 10 and unc- 87 genes of P. thornei and P. zeae resulted in paralysis and uncoordinated movements in both species, although to a higher degree in P. thornei. There was also a greater reduction in transcript of both genes in P. thornei indicating that it may be more susceptible to RNAi. For P. thornei treated with dsRNA of pat- 10 and unc- 87 there was a significant reduction (77 - 81 %) in nematode reproduction on carrot <b>mini</b> <b>discs</b> over a 5. week period. The results show that RLNs are clearly amenable to gene silencing, and that in planta delivery of dsRNA to target genes in these nematodes should confer host resistance. Moreover, for the two genes, dsRNA derived from either nematode species silenced the corresponding gene in both species. This implies cross-species control of nematodes via RNAi is possible...|$|R
5000|$|Meg, {{back in the}} company, confronts McAlistair {{about the}} X-Creatures Project, and he reveals that he was forced by Donovan to do so. She demands that he tells her {{everything}} he knows, and he agrees, but while they're in an elevator heading to his office, the Albino, Donovan's personal hitman, takes out the power to the elevator and shoots into the elevator, wounding McAlistair. Meg gets them both out of the elevator, and McAlistair painfully tells Meg that everything she needs to know is in the red drawer of his office. Meg then takes a key off of his body and goes to his office, being hunted by the Albino the whole time, and finds a tape in the red drawer. After incapacitating the Albino by electrocuting him and stealing his keycard, she finds out (From the tape) that McAlistair hid all his records about the X-creatures project in a safe, which she finds and opens. She finds therein a roster of the scientists working on the X-creatures project and a <b>mini</b> <b>disc.</b> Meanwhile, Steppenwolf {{is going to the}} Antarctic base where the research end of the X-creatures project was situated. Steppenwolf has a friend fly him nearby, and commandeers a frost jet (like a jet-powered snowmobile) to get the rest of the way. He proceeds to break into the lab, where he runs into a beast which is discovered to be an ape named Eruka, one of Shelley Thompson's experiments. He traps the beast in a box and dumps it into a vat, finding a tape soon thereafter, wherein he discovers that Shelley had figured out a way for the human body to absorb the 5 mutagenic genes they had isolated so far in a process she called OSIRIS, which stands for Osmosis of Irregular Inner Systems, which would be further explained in a tape labeled 8/05. But when Steppenwolf found the case, there was no tape inside! While this is happening, Meg is visiting {{what appears to be the}} only surviving scientist that worked on the X-creatures project, Octavio Sanchez. He tells her that the <b>mini</b> <b>disc</b> she found is the code key to the archive vault in Donovan Corporation's Houston base. After breaking through the layers of security therein, she finds the computer room, where she inserts the disc and, through a clever use of the 2 computers there and the tic-tac-toe program they have installed, she finds out about the nature of the X-creatures project, about the [...] "Heruka Incident," [...] and about Shelley Thompson Kane, wife of Alan Kane a.k.a. Steppenwolf, reported missing since the Heruka incident. It is then revealed that Donovan knows she was there as a wall moves to reveal Donovan's office, inside of which is the Albino and a bloodied Dr. Sanchez. Donovan says that he's surprised she'd made it that far, as few had, and said that Dr. Kane chooses his associates well. She says that the public must know of his actions, and he replies that they will, in due time, but he could do without media hype at the moment, and says that he could use her skills as a reporter to report on one [...] "X-creatures project" [...] and that he'd make her an offer she, [...] "...just cannot afford to refuse." [...] Meanwhile, Steppenwolf delves deeper into the base, looking for clues as to what happened. After smashing through a door, he finds that a white beast similar to the ape beast from before had killed and was eating all of the scientists. After trapping it and stunning it with light, he manages to tranquilize it with a tranquilizer gun one of the corpses had. Donovan then appears with Meg in tow and a couple of guards and greets Steppenwolf, discussing how the beast was Shelley Thompson, which Steppenwolf had figured out upon examining the body and finding her wedding ring on its finger. Steppenwolf asks about the plane crash thing, and Reggie explains that his father had wanted to save him the shock. Steppenwolf then brings up the missing tape, which Donovan says he has, and, while it's not pretty, it did entail an antidote to the [...] "change," [...] which Shelley had recorded before she injected herself with the mutagenic serum, but didn't have time to prepare before her brain degraded too far. He further explains how she then became violent, wrecking the whole place, including the X-creature blood samples needed for the antidote, which is her only chance at [...] "redemption." ...|$|E
