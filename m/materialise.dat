5|$|Within {{months he}} was making {{proposals}} for a scientific expedition to South Georgia, but the RGS would not support his plans. In early 1896 he considered collaboration with the Norwegians Henryk Bull and Carsten Borchgrevink {{in an attempt to}} reach the South Magnetic Pole. This, too, failed to <b>materialise.</b>|$|E
5|$|In May 1949, it was {{reported}} that Lympne had made a loss of £17,000 and that the Air Ministry was looking to dispose of it, although it was thought that should a sale not <b>materialise</b> it would continue in operation. In August 1950, Air Kruise started a scheduled service between Lympne and Le Touquet using Dragon Rapides. This service was operated under an associate airline agreement with British European Airways.|$|E

5|$|In mid-2006, Martinez {{joined the}} ECW brand as Ariel, a tarot reading fortune teller. Originally, Martinez {{was to be}} part of a 'vampire' faction with Gangrel and Kevin Thorn; however, the faction did not <b>materialise</b> on television. Instead, Ariel and Thorn began {{appearing}} in vignettes together, and on July 25, Thorn made his in-ring debut with Ariel acting as his valet.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, Welsh hopes of {{advancing}} the cause of female suffrage centred around the Liberal Party and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, {{one of the most}} important Welsh politicians of the day. After Liberal success in the 1906 Election failed to <b>materialise</b> into political change, suffragettes and in particular members of the more militant Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), took a hard line stance towards their Members of Parliament, engaging in direct action against them.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} war saw the end {{for many}} of the older vessels, not least the two {{remaining}} Invincible-class ships. Inflexible was paid off to the Reserve Fleet in January 1919 before being decommissioned on 31 March 1920. Chile briefly considered purchasing the ship in 1920, however the sale did not <b>materialise.</b> She was sold for scrap on 1 December 1921, and scrapped in Germany the following year. Mount Inflexible in the Canadian Rockies was named after the battlecruiser in 1917.|$|E

5|$|The pilots {{later said}} they {{attempted}} the assassination {{in response to}} Diệm's autocratic rule, in which he focused more on remaining in power than on confronting the Vietcong, a Marxist–Leninist guerilla army who were threatening to overthrow the South Vietnamese government. Cử and Quốc hoped that the airstrike would expose Diệm's vulnerability and trigger a general uprising, but this failed to <b>materialise.</b>|$|E
5|$|Veerapandiya Kattabomman was re-released in 1984 during Ramachandran's {{tenure as}} Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. The film was granted tax {{exemption}} {{by the state}} government and was commercially successful at that time as well, running for 30 weeks in theatres. In 2012, following the commercial success of the digital re-release of Karnan, Raj Television Network announced that they would re-release Veerapandiya Kattabomman in 3D in early 2013, {{but that did not}} <b>materialise.</b>|$|E
5|$|With the {{predicted}} traffic for the canal slow to <b>materialise,</b> Hooley and Marshall Stevens (the {{general manager of}} the Ship Canal Company) came to see the benefits that the industrial development of Trafford Park could offer to both the ship canal and the estate. In January 1897 Stevens became the managing director of Trafford Park Estates, where he remained until 1930, latterly as its joint chairman and managing director.|$|E

5|$|A {{couple of}} months into the season, Johnson {{suffered}} a prolapsed disc in his back; the condition was initially treated with injections, but surgery was eventually required as a lasting solution, though it would keep him out for an extended period. However, his recovery took longer than expected {{and it was not}} until the end of the season that Johnson was able to start running again, delaying any comeback until at least the start of the 2006–07 season. That comeback failed to <b>materialise,</b> and in September 2006, Johnson retired from professional football on the advice of his doctors, with his sights now set on coaching.|$|E
5|$|By the 1570s, an {{underground}} church was growing {{fast as the}} Church of England became more Protestant and less bearable for Roman Catholics who were still a sizeable minority. Only one public attempt to restore the old religion occurred: the Rising of the Northern earls in 1569. It was a botched attempt; in spite of tumultuous crowds who greeted the rebels in Durham, the rebellion did not spread. The assistance they sought did not <b>materialise,</b> their communication with allies at Court was poor. They came nowhere near to freeing Mary Stuart, whose presence might have rallied support, from her imprisonment in Tutbury.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the company's former test pilot, Lou Leavitt, had {{purchased}} {{the wreckage of}} the XR-1A at a price of 4 cents per pound. Leavitt had formed a new company, Helicopter Air Transport, intending to provide helicopter flight training in anticipation of a postwar aviation boom, and he returned the XR-1A to flying condition. The projected boom failed to <b>materialise,</b> however, and HAT quickly entered bankruptcy, Leavitt selling the XR-1A to Frank Piasecki, another former Platt-LePage employee who had now started his own helicopter company. Piasecki soon grounded the aircraft due to airworthiness concerns, and used the airframe {{in the development of the}} PA-2B, a planned tiltrotor which failed to proceed beyond the mock-up stage.|$|E

40|$|Query {{rewriting}} is {{a prominent}} reasoning technique in ontologybased data access (OBDA) applications. Roughly speaking, a rewriting of a query Q w. r. t. an ontology is another query Q^ 1 {{that can be}} directly evaluated over the data without further reference to the input ontology. In this paper, we observe that many OBDA applications could significantly benefit from precomputing rewritings for certain queries. For example, in query optimisation, <b>materialised</b> rewritings of frequently asked queries {{can be used to}} speed up the query reformulation process. Moreover, in systems where users have different levels of access to information, <b>materialised</b> rewritings for the views assigned to each user can be exploited to obtain the set of answers to the input query derivable from the assigned views. Consequently, we investigate the problem of reformulating a query given a set of <b>materialised</b> rewritings and present a practical algorithm. Subsequently, we use our approach to design a fully edged query rewriting algorithm which can exploit <b>materialised</b> rewritings to speed up the rewriting process. Our experimental results confirm the potential of our technique in practice...|$|R
5|$|Nicolls {{had many}} such grand schemes for trade between Britain and its colonies, but these all failed to <b>materialise.</b> These schemes {{included}} {{a plan to}} grow oaks in the unlikely location of Sierra Leone for Royal Navy ships, a plan to ship Ascension rocks to England, and a plan to ship New Zealand flax to England which he discussed {{in a letter to}} Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst. On 3 November 1828 Captain William Bate replaced Nicolls as commandant on Ascension. Nicolls was given the substantive rank of major before leaving, on 8 May 1828.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebels in}} Bjelovar used the {{telegraph}} station and telephone exchange {{in the town}} to issue false orders to parts of the 104th Infantry Regiment directing them to withdraw from their positions. The rebels also contacted the Germans by telephone and sent representatives to meet the Germans at the Drava bridgeheads, to advise them that the roads had been cleared of obstacles, and Makanec invited them to enter Bjelovar. Nedeljković's threats to bomb the town did not <b>materialise,</b> and rebels and deserters began to converge on Bjelovar, bringing with them many Serb officers and soldiers who soon filled the town's jails.|$|E
5|$|When Air Chief Marshal Burnett {{completed}} his term in 1942, Williams was once more {{considered for the}} role of CAS. This was vetoed by Prime Minister John Curtin and the appointment unexpectedly went to acting Air Commodore George Jones. A mooted Inspector Generalship of the Air Force, which would have seen Williams reporting directly to the Minister for Air, also failed to <b>materialise.</b> Instead Williams was posted to Washington, D.C. as the RAAF's representative to the Combined Chiefs of Staff in the United States, and remained there {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5000|$|A 15-year-old Cook, {{alone in}} Crookes' house with Crookes' {{friends and family}} as witnesses, {{was said to have}} <b>materialised</b> the spirit of Katie King, who walked about, talked, allowed herself to be weighed and measured, and even held the family's baby (Doyle 1926: volume 1, 241). On one occasion, at a joint seance in Crookes's home in March 1874, Katie King was seen in company with [...] "Florence Maple", a spirit <b>materialised</b> by the medium Mary Showers who was exposed as a fraud shortly thereafter. The {{sessions}} were held with the medium secluded in the dark, because Spiritualists believe that materialisation requires very dim surroundings to succeed, though occasionally the spirits <b>materialised</b> in the light and some photographs were taken. As is apparently typical of <b>materialised</b> spirits, Katie's exact height and weight varied, though Katie was always taller than Florence Cook, with a larger face, and different hair and skin. According to those present, the two were both visible at the same moments, so that Florence could not have assumed the role of the spirit (Doyle 1926: volume 1, 235-240).|$|R
