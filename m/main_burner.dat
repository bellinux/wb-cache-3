40|$|Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is now {{recognized}} as an efficient numerical tool to predict gaseous combustion in industrial burners, {{and a number of}} examples of applications {{can be found in the}} literature. In these examples, the accuracy and the predictive capacity of LES are clearly demonstrated, even for unsteady phenomena. However most industrial burners are fed with liquid fuel and require the description of droplets dispersion, evaporation and burning. The presence of liquid fuel strongly modifies the fuel vapor distribution in the chamber, leading to different flame ignition and stabilisation processes, as well as different flame structures. Extending the LES technique to two-phase reacting flow is therefore crucial to capture and predict the behavior of such burners. This has been done in the code AVBP, coupling an eulerian solver for the liquid spray with a LES solver for the gas flow. This approach allows to work on unstructured grids and therefore to calculate the flow in complex geometries.

The furnace operates by allowing a short natural gas flame to burn over the face of a wall of porous fire brick on two sides of the furnace. Each firing wall uses two <b>main</b> <b>burners</b> and a pilot burner to heat the porous fire brick to a luminous glow. Regulators and orifice valves are used to provide a minimum gas pressure of 4 in. water column at a rate of approximately 1, 450 scf/h to the burners.

Observed flame length and vendor literature were used to calculate pilot burner gas consumption. Air for combustion, purging, and cooling is supplied by a single blower. Rough calculations of the air-flow distribution in piping entering the furnace show that air flow to the burners approximately agrees with the calculated natural gas flow.

Model I assumes that the <b>main</b> <b>burner</b> fuel is completely oxidized to CO,CO 2,H 20 and fuel bound nitrogen is released as HCN, NH 3, N 2; these partially burnt product mixes with tertiary air, undergoes chemical reactions specified by kinetics and burns to complete combustion.

Results from the model recommend the following conditions for optimal reduction of NOx: Equivalence Ratio should be above 0. 95; mixing time should be below 100 ms.

Taking into consideration that we analyzed dilute mixture with very low volume fraction of the coal, the only choice was the Euler-Lagrange approach, i. e. discrete phase model limited to volume fraction of the discrete phase less than 10 - 12 %. Obtained distributions of the coal at the burners agree well for both types of separators...|$|R
40|$|Airfoil {{theory for}} {{unsteady}} motion {{has been developed}} extensively assuming the undisturbed medium to be of uniform density, a restriction accurate for motion in the atmosphere, G/auert (1929), Burgers (1935), Theodorsen (1935), Kussner (1936), Karman and Sears (1938), Kinney and Sears (1975). In some instances, notably for airfoils comprising fan, compressor and turbine blade rows, the undisturbed medium may carry density variations or "spots," resulting from non-uniformaties in temperature or composition, of a size comparable to the blade chord. This condition existsfor turbine blades, Marble (1975), Giles and Krouthen (1988), immediately downstream of the <b>main</b> <b>burner</b> of a gas turbine engine where the density fluctuations {{of the order of}} 50 percent may occur. Disturbances of a somewhat smaller magnitude arise from the ingestion of hot boundary layers into fans, Wortman (1975), and exhaust into hovercraft. Because these regions of non-uniform density convect with the moving medium, the airfoil experiences a time varying load and moment which we propose to calculate...|$|E
