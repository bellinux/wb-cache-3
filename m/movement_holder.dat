50|$|Launched in 2002, Peter Speake-Marin’s first {{wristwatch}} was the Piccadilly. Various Piccadilly {{series and}} unique pieces {{have been created}} since, {{the first of which}} was the Original Piccadilly featuring enamel dial. The Piccadilly case features screwed lugs, pleated crown and a drum-like case shape, which was inspired by the <b>movement</b> <b>holders</b> Peter Speake-Marin worked while at Renaud & Papi, and named after his seven years in antique restoration at Somlo in Piccadilly, London.|$|R
40|$|DE 102007053843 A 1 UPAB: 20090602 NOVELTY - The garment (10), {{pulled over}} the thorax. is {{structured}} {{to register the}} wearer's respiration using an electric cable (12) at the thorax height to alter an electrically-measurable characteristic according to the thorax respiration <b>movements.</b> A <b>holder</b> (14) takes an integrated electronic evaluation unit (16), connected to the conductor. The evaluation unit has an interface for connection to an external data store. USE - The garment monitors the wearer's lung functions through respiration movements at the thorax. ADVANTAGE - The garment is comfortable to wear and gives accurate readings of the respiration movements...|$|R

25|$|According {{to privacy}} advocates, the BAC and the {{shielded}} cover are ineffective when a passport is open, and a passport {{may have to}} be opened for inspection in a public place such as a hotel, a bank, or an Internet cafe. An open passport is subject to unwelcome reading of chip data, such as by a government agent who is tracking a passport <b>holder's</b> <b>movements</b> or by a criminal who is intending identity theft.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the {{magazine}} denounced segregationist George Wallace, who ran in Democratic primaries in 1964 and 1972 {{and made an}} independent {{run for president in}} 1968. During the 1950s, Buckley had worked to remove anti-Semitism from the conservative <b>movement</b> and barred <b>holders</b> of those views from working for National Review. In 1962 Buckley denounced Robert W. Welch, Jr. and the John Birch Society as [...] "far removed from common sense" [...] and urged the G.O.P. to purge itself of Welch's influence.|$|R
40|$|During {{minimally}} invasive procedures an assistant is controlling the laparoscope. Ideally, the surgeon {{should be able}} to manipulate all instruments including the camera him/herself, to avoid communication problems and disturbing camera <b>movements.</b> Camera <b>holders</b> return camera-control to the surgeon and stabilize the laparoscopic image. An additional holder can be used to stabilize an extra laparoscopic instrument for retracting. A literature survey has been carried out giving an over-view of the existing "robotic" and passive camera and instrument holders and, if available, results of their clinical value. Benefits and limitations were identified. Most studies showed that camera holders, passive and active, provide the surgeon with a more stable image and enables them to control their own view direction. Only the passive holders were suitable for holding instruments. Comparisons between different systems are reviewed. Both active and passive camera and instrument holders are functional, and may be helpful to perforin solo-surgery. The benefits of active holders are questionable in relation to the performance of the much simpler passive design...|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Buckley {{disagreed}} strenuously with segregationist George Wallace, who ran in Democratic primaries (1964 and 1972) {{and made an}} independent {{run for president in}} 1968, and debated passionately against Wallace's segregationist platform in a broadcast on Firing Line. Buckley later said he wished National Review had been more supportive of civil rights legislation in the 1960s. He grew to admire Martin Luther King, Jr. and supported creation of a Martin Luther King, Jr. Day national holiday for him.

It first appears in the datable epigraphic record in 122, in Britannia. It was still there in 138-61, the time of its last datable inscription. [...] It is attested in the following Roman forts in Britannia: High Rochester, Maryport (138-61) and Chesters (138-61).|$|R
25|$|Once {{inserted}} into a TEM, the sample {{has to be}} manipulated to locate the region {{of interest to the}} beam, such as in single grain diffraction, in a specific orientation. To accommodate this, the TEM stage allows movement of the sample in the XY plane, Z height adjustment, and commonly a single tilt direction parallel to the axis of side entry bolders. Sample rotation may be available on specialized diffraction holders and stages. Some modern TEMs provide the ability for two orthogonal tilt angles of <b>movement</b> with specialized <b>holder</b> designs called double-tilt sample holders. Some stage designs, such as top-entry or vertical insertion stages once common for high resolution TEM studies, may simply only have X-Y translation available. The design criteria of TEM stages are complex, owing to the simultaneous requirements of mechanical and electron-optical constraints and specialized models are available for different methods.|$|R

It was still there in the 3rd century, the time of its last roughly datable inscription, a votive altar at Magnis (Carvoran, Northumbria). The Notitia Dignitatum, a late Roman official document, records a cohors II Delmatarum at Magnis under the dux Britanniarum, the commander of limitanei (border forces) along Hadrian's Wall. The Western section of the Notitia was drawn up in the 420's but the British units must date to before 410, when the island was evacuated by the Roman army.|$|R

The latter is incomplete, but is plausibly though not conclusively attributed to IV Delmatarum. The regiment's disappearance from the epigraphic record in the early 2nd century has led Spaul to suggest that the regiment was merged with another to form the cohors I Pannoniorum et Delmatarum equitata c.R. attested in Germania Inferior in 127 and beyond. But the record overall is too incomplete to support any firm conclusions.|$|R

40|$|The sky is clear, {{the field}} is vast. Dancing in rhythm with each other, Dike, Eirene and Eunomia, the golden Horae, mark the passing of time. Through the ways they move in their rhythmic flow, they allow time to be re-born over and over. They stamp the ground with all their weight, and, when they gently lift their feet, out of each of their {{footprints}} life arises from Earth again and again, season by season. The cycles of birth and death become possible and meaningful through their playful encounter. Constant recreation of life depends on the interplay of their power, grace and virtue. The three beings in <b>movement,</b> mystic <b>holders</b> of law, peace and good government, give form to themis – the di-vine law of ebb and flow, of times of wealth and times of scarcity, of giving and taking. Through their dance, they connect heavenly and earthly realms, the ethereal divine and the concrete shapes that life takes over and over – al-ways different, always the same. They are ultimately {{the result of the}} eternal encounter between Heaven and Earth, Uranus and Gaea, progenitors of the matrix that gave birth to the three sisters: Themis. Law, thus, {{is nothing more than a}} dance with the di-vine. For sure, the image of a dancing law, justice, govern-ment or order might appear quite strange today when we are confronted daily with the formal structures of codes, contracts and courts, and the bureaucracy connecting them. Rather than a dance it might feel like moving within a spiky labyrinth of wires. Nevertheless, what every judge and legislator still advocates today in the name of law and justice is the act of balance this type of work implies, a bal-ance that goes beyond the structural capacity of the scales of Justice. It includes a myriad of elements beyond posi-tive law that need to find a certain equilibrium with each artIcL...|$|R
