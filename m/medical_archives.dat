25|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, {{the concept}} of popular medicine, or folk medicine, has been {{familiar}} to both doctors and anthropologists. Doctors, anthropologists and medical anthropologists used these terms to describe the resources, other than the help of health professionals, which European or Latin American peasants used to resolve any health problems. The term was also {{used to describe the}} health practices of aborigines {{in different parts of the}} world, with particular emphasis on their ethnobotanical knowledge. This knowledge is fundamental for isolating alkaloids and active pharmacological principles. Furthermore, studying the rituals surrounding popular therapies served to challenge Western psychopathological categories, as well as the relationship in the West between science and religion. Doctors were not trying to turn popular medicine into an anthropological concept, rather they wanted to construct a scientifically based medical concept which they could use to establish the cultural limits of biomedicine. Examples of this practice can be found in <b>medical</b> <b>archives</b> and oral history projects.|$|E

The electronic <b>medical</b> image <b>archive</b> system can help to solve the problem faced in previous physical medium archiving, thus increasing productivity and time which patients are attended to. In this paper, simple but functional electronic <b>medical</b> image <b>archive</b> architecture was proposed and implemented. The system was further evaluated in a hospital setting by medical experts using sample patient image data. Results of the system evaluation shows that electronic <b>medical</b> image <b>archiving</b> systems can actually promote efficiency, quality improvement, provide timely availability of radiologic images, image consultation, and image interpretation in emergent and no emergent clinical care areas among other benefit...|$|R
