5|$|Storm petrels {{are small}} birds which spend <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> at sea, coming ashore only to breed. They feed on planktonic {{crustaceans}} and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering or pattering across the water. Their flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like.|$|E
5|$|The Snake River {{was once}} one of the most {{important}} rivers for the spawning of anadromous fish—which are hatched in the headwaters of rivers, live in the ocean for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> and return to the river to spawn—in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The swifts {{are small}} birds, {{spending}} <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> flying. They have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have very long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang.|$|E

Six of the 1937–38 batches led a quiet life, being situated at Polmadie {{for the whole}} of their lives, apart from their initial spell at Camden. Others were moved from shed to shed for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> Nos. 6251 and 6252 being particularly well travelled.|$|E
5|$|In January 1995, Selena headlined the Teach the Children {{festival in}} San Antonio. The concert funded a {{non-profit}} program to provide school supplies to needy children. Selena was {{a spokesperson for}} women in abusive relationships. She also helped out at homeless shelters. According to the A television series Biography, Selena's fans were often minorities; she encouraged them to make the <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} this interaction, Presley and Jackson spoke on the telephone almost every day, forging a strong friendship. The two came to realize they had much in common: both had been protected and sheltered from the real world, both felt they had missed out on a normal childhood, both were mistrustful of outsiders having spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> feeling exploited by them, and both had problems with the media. Presley was raised in Graceland, while Jackson lived at Neverland.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> {{were spent}} in the European area of Calcutta, which was walled off from the {{indigenous}} sectors of the city, Murray encountered members of indigenous society through her family's employment of 10 Indian servants and through childhood holidays to Mussoorie. The historian Amara Thornton has suggested that Murray's Indian childhood continued to exert an influence over her throughout her life, expressing the view that Murray {{could be seen as}} having a hybrid transnational identity that was both British and Indian. During her childhood, Murray never received a formal education, and in later life expressed pride in {{the fact that she had}} never had to sit an exam before entering university.|$|E
5|$|In English, Jonathan Swift (30 November 1667 – 19 October 1745), {{often called}} the {{foremost}} satirist in the English language, gained fame for works such as Gulliver's Travels and A Modest Proposal. Other notable eighteenth century writers of Irish origin included Oliver Goldsmith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan, though they spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> in England. The Anglo-Irish novel {{came to the fore}} in the nineteenth century, featuring such writers as Charles Kickham, William Carleton, and (in collaboration) Edith Somerville and Violet Florence Martin. The playwright and poet Oscar Wilde, noted for his epigrams, was born in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Many Welsh {{painters}} gravitated {{towards the}} art capitals of Europe. Augustus John {{and his sister}} Gwen John lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast lived in Wales for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> while remaining {{in touch with the}} wider art world. Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London. He was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism. Various artists have moved to Wales, including Eric Gill, the London-Welshman David Jones and the sculptor Jonah Jones. The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and poet and artist Vernon Watkins in Swansea, which also included the painter Alfred Janes.|$|E

50|$|The {{band was}} unique, {{even in the}} 1960s, in that they (at Tommy Hall's urging) played <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>live</b> shows and {{recorded}} their albums while {{under the influence of}} LSD, and built their lifestyle and music around the psychedelic experience. Intellectual and esoteric influences helped shape their work, which shows traces of Gurdjieff, the General Semantics of Alfred Korzybski, the psychedelic philosophy of Timothy Leary, and Tantric meditation.|$|R
5|$|Over 40 {{species of}} mammals have been documented, {{including}} the black bear, coyote, cougar, bobcat, beaver, river otter, black-tailed deer, and elk. Along the coastline, California sea lions, Steller sea lions and harbor seals {{live near the}} shore and on seastacks, rocky outcroppings forming small islands just off the coast. Dolphins and Pacific gray whales are occasionally seen offshore. Roosevelt elk are the most readily observed of the large mammals in the park. Successful herds, brought back from the verge of extinction in the region, are now a common site in park areas south of the Klamath River. Many smaller mammals live in the high forest canopy. Different species of bats, such as the big brown bat, and other smaller mammals including the red squirrel and northern flying squirrel spend <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> well above the forest floor.|$|E
5|$|Although {{pinnipeds}} are widespread, {{most species}} prefer the colder {{waters of the}} Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They spend <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> in the water, but come ashore to mate, give birth, molt or escape from predators, like sharks and killer whales. They feed largely on fish and marine invertebrates; but a few, like the leopard seal, feed on large vertebrates, such as penguins and other seals. Walruses are specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling mollusks. Male pinnipeds typically mate {{with more than one}} female (polygyny), although the degree of polygyny varies with the species. The males of land-breeding species tend to mate with a greater number of females than those of ice- or water-breeding species. Male pinniped strategies for reproductive success vary between defending females, defending territories that attract females and performing ritual displays or lek mating. Pups are typically born {{in the spring and summer}} months and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively short period of time while others take foraging trips at sea between nursing bouts. Walruses are known to nurse their young while at sea. Seals produce a number of vocalizations, notably the barks of California sea lions, the gong-like calls of walruses and the complex songs of Weddell seals.|$|E
5|$|Some writers {{that emerged}} after the Second World War {{followed}} MacDiarmid by writing in Scots, including Robert Garioch and Sydney Goodsir Smith. Others demonstrated a {{greater interest in}} English language poetry, among them Norman MacCaig, George Bruce and Maurice Lindsay. George Mackay Brown from Orkney, and Iain Crichton Smith from Lewis, wrote both poetry and prose fiction shaped by their distinctive island backgrounds. The Glaswegian poet Edwin Morgan became known for translations of works {{from a wide range}} of European languages. He was also the first Scots Makar (the official national poet), appointed by the inaugural Scottish government in 2004. Many major Scottish post-war novelists, such as Muriel Spark, James Kennaway, Alexander Trocchi, Jessie Kesson and Robin Jenkins spent much or <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> outside Scotland, but often dealt with Scottish themes, as in Spark's Edinburgh-set The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961) and Kennaway's script for the film Tunes of Glory (1956). Successful mass-market works included the action novels of Alistair MacLean, and the historical fiction of Dorothy Dunnett. A younger generation of novelists that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s included Shena Mackay, Alan Spence, Allan Massie and the work of William McIlvanney.|$|E

25|$|Coral snakes {{vary widely}} in their behavior, {{but most are}} very elusive, fossorial snakes which spend the vast {{majority}} of their time buried beneath the ground or in the leaf litter of a rainforest floor, coming to the surface only when it rains or during breeding season.
