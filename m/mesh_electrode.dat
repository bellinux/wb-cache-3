Results: The highest removal rate 99 %was obtained at pH 3 within 20 min. Kinetics experiment studies showed that removal of dye was faster at lower initial dye concentrations. The results revealed that color removal was highest at a Fe 2 +:H 2 O 2 ratio of 1 : 4. An increase in current density resulted {{in an increase in}} oxidation rate and faster removal of color. The results demonstrated that increasing the size of the mesh pores led to an increase in the percentage of dye removal. The highest removal percentage (94. 5 %) was observed in 25 min with a <b>mesh</b> 2 <b>electrode.</b> The constant rate of dye removal on steel mesh 2 was 6. 6 times higher than a steel plate.

40|$|Mine {{tailings}} are the {{end product}} of mining and mineral processing after the mineral has been extracted, which are discharged as slurry of low solid contents. Chemical flocculants, such as polymers and inorganic salts, are often used to assist tailings dewatering for subsequent disposal. However, in cases that tailings contain significant fraction of fine solids (in the micro meter range) and clay minerals, the dewatering process becomes increasingly difficult and time consuming. In this study, the water flow generated by electrokinetics on mine tailings from a mine site in Saskatchewan, Canada is investigated. The tailings contain mainly gypsum, quartz and clay minerals. The tailings are characterized for the geotechnical, physical, chemical and mineralogical properties first, and then electrokinetic cell tests are carried out to measure the coefficient of electroosmotic permeability, a key parameter on the response of tailings to electrokinetic dewatering. Two conductive materials are used as electrodes in the study, i. e., a stainless steel SS 316 mesh, which is a high-grade corrosion resistant material; and an electrical vertical drain using a conductive polymer as the conductor. The {{results of the study}} show that the electrokinetic dewatering would be very effective on the tailings using SS 316 <b>mesh</b> <b>electrodes,</b> indicated by the magnitude of the coefficient of electroosmotic permeability, quantity of water transported through the tailings specimen, duration of water flow, effective current density and applied voltage gradient.
