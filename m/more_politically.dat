5|$|After {{weeks of}} {{speculation}} and party infighting, {{he said he}} did not want to become Prime Minister. In mid-March 2008, he chose Yousaf Raza Gillani for Prime Minister in a snub to the <b>more</b> <b>politically</b> powerful Makhdoom Amin Fahim.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 20th century, the Republican Party {{replaced}} the Democratic Party {{as the dominant}} party in the state, as the latter became <b>more</b> <b>politically</b> liberal and as demographic changes favored the former.|$|E
5|$|In {{some of the}} <b>more</b> <b>politically</b> {{unstable}} central African {{and west}} African countries, revolutionary groups have taken control of diamond mines, using proceeds from diamond sales to finance their operations. Diamonds sold through this process are known as conflict diamonds or blood diamonds.|$|E
50|$|His work {{highlights}} how Asia {{is coming}} together economically but getting <b>more</b> divided <b>politically.</b> Although Europe has built institutions to underpin peace, Asia {{has yet to}} begin such a process in earnest.|$|R
2500|$|That {{appears to}} have been <b>more</b> a <b>politically</b> advised than a factual statement, in that it lacks congruity with an {{ordinary}} or accurate reading of the legislation enacted by Parliament (see further information below [...] "Accuracy of Government Information").|$|R
50|$|Käsemann {{was born}} in Bochum. He {{obtained}} his PhD in New Testament at the University of Marburg in 1931, having written a dissertation on Pauline ecclesiology, with Rudolf Bultmann as his doctoral supervisor. Käsemann was one of Bultmann's <b>more</b> well-known <b>politically</b> left-of-centre 'pupils'.|$|R
5|$|As Sicily now {{becomes a}} <b>more</b> <b>politically</b> stable, secure and less corrupt environment, the Baroque palazzi are slowly {{beginning}} {{to open their}} doors to an eager paying public, American and Northern European as much as Italian. In 1963, when the movie The Leopard was released the Gangi Palace ballroom was almost unique in its status of having been a film set, but today long unused salons and ballrooms are hosting corporate and public events. Some palazzi are offering a bed and breakfast service to paying guests, once again providing impressive hospitality to visitors to Sicily, the purpose {{for which they were}} originally intended.|$|E
5|$|Daara J {{was formed}} in 1997 and quickly became popular in Senegal from the release of their first {{cassette}} album, Daara J. They followed in 1999 with a <b>more</b> <b>politically</b> themed recording, Xalima, which integrated numerous musical ideas and instruments from Senegal and other African countries. 2003's Boomerang was critically acclaimed and furthered the combination of various musical and lyrical influences of the previous two recordings. Activism has also been {{an important aspect of}} the group's philosophy since it was founded.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourteenth}} season, Bart {{convinced}} Krusty {{to run for}} Congress so that Krusty could introduce an airline rerouting bill and stop planes from flying over the Simpsons' house. Krusty agreed and ran on the Republican ticket. Although his campaign started off badly, Lisa suggested that he try connecting with regular families, which Krusty did, resulting in a landslide victory. Krusty's term started off badly, as he was completely ignored by his new, <b>more</b> <b>politically</b> savvy colleagues. With {{the help of the}} Simpsons and an influential doorman, however, Krusty succeeded in passing his bill.|$|E
5000|$|We still {{disagree}} about everything. I mean, he's <b>more</b> conservative <b>politically</b> and {{also is a}} pragmatist. He's very pragmatic and wants everything to line up {{and put in a}} box. And I'm a little bit looser. Tommy Smothers (on his brother Dick),from a 2006 interview.|$|R
5|$|According to {{a recent}} survey, the ONA has more female {{supporters}} than either the Church of Satan or the Temple of Set; more women with children; more older supporters; more supporters who are better established in socio-economic terms; and <b>more</b> who <b>politically</b> are further to the Right.|$|R
50|$|<b>More</b> was <b>politically</b> unambitious, gaining his whip posts {{largely through}} {{conscientious}} attendance. He principally devoted himself {{to life as}} a country squire.

5|$|The {{unpredictability of}} the show and Banksy's elusive nature stirred {{excitement}} amongst fans, while defacement from competing street artists and vandals became an imminent problem. While Banksy's works were inherently illegal, no official complaints were reported to the police; most property owners praised the art and some took measures to protect it. The month-long residency drew controversy amongst some locals for its <b>more</b> <b>politically</b> strong pieces, and received mixed reviews from critics. A documentary film covering this period titled Banksy Does New York was released in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Angelou becomes <b>more</b> <b>politically</b> {{active and}} participates in African-American and African protest rallies, {{including}} helping {{to organize a}} sit-in at the United Nations following the execution of Patrice Lumumba, the ousted prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She meets Malcolm X and is struck by his good looks and magnetism. After hearing Martin Luther King Jr. speak, she and her friend, activist Godfrey Cambridge, are inspired to produce a successful fundraising event for King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) called Cabaret For Freedom. King names her coordinator of SCLC's office in New York. She performs in Jean Genet's play The Blacks, with Roscoe Lee Brown, James Earl Jones, and Cicely Tyson.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Ohio, the degree from a prestigious Eastern school made Garfield a man of distinction. He {{returned}} to Hiram to teach at the Institute, and in 1857 was made its president. He did not see education as a field that would realize his full potential. At Williams, he had become <b>more</b> <b>politically</b> aware in the intensely anti-slavery atmosphere of the Massachusetts school, and began to consider politics as a career. In 1858, he married Lucretia; they would have seven children, five of whom survived infancy. Soon after the wedding, he formally entered his name to read law at a Cleveland firm, although he did his studying in Hiram. He {{was admitted to the}} bar in 1861.|$|E
50|$|The Act itself did not {{quell the}} agitation. In {{particular}} {{it was very}} weak in terms of enabling the Crofters Commission to resolve disputes about access to land. It was enough however to make much <b>more</b> acceptable, <b>politically,</b> the use of troops in confrontations with agitators.|$|R
50|$|In recent decades, Native Americans in the United States {{have become}} <b>more</b> active <b>politically,</b> voting in {{increasing}} numbers in local, state and national elections. In 2004, Thurston, a majority-Native American county, {{was the only one}} in Nebraska with a majority voting for the Democratic Party presidential candidate, John Kerry.|$|R
5000|$|In late 2009 Loong {{competed for}} the 1st District {{representative}} slot {{as a candidate}} of Lakas Kampi CMD and won, returning to local politics. As representative he has urged the government to refocus its efforts to address the decades-old rebellion in Mindanao. He stressed that [...] "the Philippine government needs to become fairer economically, <b>more</b> accountable <b>politically,</b> <b>more</b> responsible socially, more sensitive culturally, and provides equal opportunity to all -- they be Lumad, Bangsamoro or Christian. Ultimately, this will facilitate resolving the Mindanao conflict not only by structurally addressing its root causes through the peace negotiations, but also by healing the deep social, cultural and religious gaps or misunderstandings." ...|$|R
5|$|The Nation Alliance Party {{was founded}} in June 2007 by four people: realtor Wei Ping Chen of Delta, renovator Steven Lian from Surrey, tourism guide Randy Liu from Burnaby, and Simon Fraser University student Locan Wang. Party leader Wei Ping Chen had immigrated to Canada from Beijing, via Australia. He {{witnessed}} the challenges that recent immigrants faced once in a new country, and how uninvolved they were in politics. Contrasted to his experience in China, Wei Ping Chen {{was impressed with the}} political freedoms available in Canada and felt motivated to start a political party. He felt that political campaigns oriented towards recent immigrants and people whose first language is not English, would empower those communities to become <b>more</b> <b>politically</b> active.|$|E
5|$|The new {{industrial}} workforce often {{lived and}} worked under very poor conditions, and enjoyed few employment rights. Workers who left their jobs in protest could find themselves arrested by the mounted police {{under the terms of}} the Masters and Servants Act for deserting their employment, or alternatively detained under the vagrancy laws. Although the position of organised labour was weak in Canada – the trade unions only had very limited legal rights – the number of industrial disputes grew significantly over this period. The resulting lockouts and strikes sometimes required armed government intervention. The militia was most commonly used for this purpose, but the mounted police were cheaper to deploy and were considered to be <b>more</b> <b>politically</b> reliable.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} Bond in 1981 saw media {{reports on the}} <b>more</b> <b>politically</b> correct Bond and his choice of car—a Saab 900 Turbo; Gardner later {{put him in a}} Bentley Mulsanne Turbo. Gardner also updated Bond's firearm: under Gardner, Bond is {{initially}} issued with the Browning 9mm before changing to a Heckler & Koch VP70 and then a Heckler & Koch P7. Bond is also revealed to have taken part in the 1982 Falklands War. Gardner updated Fleming's characters and used contemporary political leaders in his novels; he also used the high-tech apparatus of Q Branch from the films, although Jeremy Black observed that Bond is more reliant on technology than his own individual abilities. Gardner's series linked Bond to the Fleming novels rather than the film incarnations and referred to events covered in the Fleming stories.|$|E

5|$|Tyler's {{successor}} in the Senate was William Cabell Rives, {{a conservative}} Democrat. In February 1839, the General Assembly considered who should fill that seat, {{which was to}} expire the following month. Rives had drifted away from his party, signalling a possible alliance with the Whigs. As Tyler had already fully rejected the Democrats, he expected the Whigs would support him. Still, many Whigs found Rives a <b>more</b> <b>politically</b> expedient choice, as they hoped to ally with the conservative wing of the Democratic Party in the 1840 presidential election. This strategy was supported by Whig leader Henry Clay, who nevertheless admired Tyler at that time. With the vote split among three candidates, including Rives and Tyler, the Senate seat remained vacant for almost two years, until January 1841.|$|E
5|$|Moving to Northern California, McNallen began {{a career}} as a school teacher; during the summer {{vacations}} he travelled the world as a military journalist, writing articles for Soldier of Fortune magazine. Concerned by what he saw as the growth of liberal, universalist ideas in Heathenry, he returned to active involvement in the Heathen movement in the mid-1990s, establishing the Asatrú Folk Assembly, which was headquartered in Grass Valley, California. In 1997 he was involved in the establishment of the International Asatru/Odinist Alliance alongside Murray's AA and the British Odinic Rite. He brought greater attention to his group after they became involved in the debate surrounding the Kennewick Man, arguing that it constituted evidence for a European presence in prehistoric America. In the 21st century he became <b>more</b> <b>politically</b> active, becoming involved in both environmentalist campaigns and a group promoting the rights of European Americans.|$|E
5|$|Khánh {{soon came}} to {{dominate}} the MRC. He {{turned out to be}} far <b>more</b> <b>politically</b> astute and motivated than the previous junta, seeking out veteran Vietnamese politicians and technocrats to create a new government. A week after taking power, Khánh summoned Dr. Nguyen Ton Hoan, a Catholic {{who was one of the}} former leaders of the southern branch of the Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam). Hoan had been exiled in Paris during the Diệm era, but remained active, publishing a magazine and keeping up to speed with developments in Vietnam. Hoan had generated little popular following during his campaign for power in the 1940s and 1950s and was unable to form a government as prime minister when he returned. Khánh thereupon decided to act as both Prime Minister and Chairman of the reorganized MRC, which he expanded to include 17 generals and 32 further officers for a total of 50 members. Hoan was appointed as the first Deputy Prime Minister in charge of rural pacification. He was given control of five ministries including the Interior, National Defense and Rural Affairs and two special commissions, which were primarily engaged in consolidating the strategic hamlets of Ngô Đình Nhu into the renamed New Rural Life Hamlets. The second Deputy Prime Minister was Harvard University-trained banker and economist Nguyễn Xuân Oánh, who was associated to the Đại Việt. Oanh was charged with managing the finance and economy of the country. Mậu was the Third Deputy Prime Minister, overseeing social and cultural affairs. Other Đại Việt politicians given cabinet posts included Phan Huy Quát as foreign minister and Ha Thuc Ky as interior minister. However, the second most powerful member of the new regime was Khiêm, who was defense minister, and Khánh firmly controlled the civilian government through the junta, which he rearranged to give greater weight to his fellow coup-plotters.|$|E
50|$|Denis, a Catholic tertiary, {{married his}} first wife, Marthe Meurier, in 1893. They had seven children, {{and she would}} pose for {{numerous}} Denis works. Following her death in 1919, Denis painted a chapel dedicated to her memory. Two years later, he married again, to Elisabeth Graterolle, and fathered two <b>more</b> children. <b>Politically,</b> {{he was close to}} the monarchist Action Française movement.|$|R

50|$|As {{the cameras}} became more {{widespread}} the issue became <b>more</b> contentious <b>politically.</b> In particular motoring bodies {{began to question}} the effectiveness of speed cameras {{as a means for}} accident prevention. This created a demand for research showing whether or not the cameras were, in practice, effective at reducing deaths and injuries from road accidents. Four independent evaluation reports were commissioned by the DfT to address this.|$|R

5000|$|As the {{revolution}} neared, Bullitt became <b>more</b> active <b>politically.</b> He joined Prince William County's Committee of Safety along with Lynaugh Helm and Henry Lee. In 1776 he and Henry [...] "Light Horse Harry" [...] Lee were the county's delegates to a revolutionary Provincial Congress of Virginia. That meeting became a constitutional convention, producing an interim constitution {{used by the}} province {{for the next several}} years.|$|R
50|$|When Genghis Khan was {{deciding}} who should succeed him, {{he had trouble}} choosing between his four sons. Tolui had amazing military skills and was very successful as a general, but Genghis Khan chose Ögodei, who was <b>more</b> capable <b>politically.</b> Genghis Khan felt that Tolui would be too cautious {{to be an effective}} leader. Tolui was with his father on campaign against Xi Xia in 1227.|$|R
40|$|Beckett {{has been}} made the centrepiece {{of what might be}} called a {{contemporary}} aesthetics of the inexhaustible, which assumes the sovereign value of endless propagation and maintains a horror of any kind of limit. Having perhaps helped in some of my previous work to recruit Beckett to this aesthetic, I argue in this paper that Beckett is in fact a writer who is governed by the principles of limit and finitude, principles that are in fact both philosophically <b>more</b> provocative and <b>politically</b> <b>more</b> responsible than the cult of endless exceeding that has attached itself to Beckett...|$|R
