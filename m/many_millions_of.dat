5|$|Earth's {{lithosphere}} {{is divided}} into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of <b>many</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> years. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans. The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes, rivers and other sources of water {{that contribute to the}} hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|The {{proximity}} of the Peak to major conurbations and urban areas (an estimated 20 million people live within an hour's drive) poses unique challenges for managing the area. The Peak District National Park Authority and the National Trust, with other landowners, attempt to balance keeping the upland landscape accessible to visitors for recreation, whilst protecting it from intensive farming, erosion and pressure from visitors themselves. An inevitable tension exists between {{the needs of the}} 38,000 residents of the Peak District National Park, the needs of the <b>many</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> people who visit it annually, and the conservation requirements of the area.|$|E

5|$|After 150 {{million years}} of volcanism, plutonism, metamorphism, and thrust {{faulting}} had run their course, {{the early part}} of the Cenozoic era (early Tertiary, 6530 Ma) was a time of repose; neither igneous nor sedimentary rocks of this age are known here. A relatively featureless plain was created from erosion over <b>many</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> years. Deposition resumed some 35 Ma in the Oligocene epoch on a flood plain that developed in the area; sluggish streams migrated laterally over the surface, laying down cobbles, sand, and mud. Outcrops of the resulting conglomerates, sandstone, and mudstone of the Titus Canyon Formation can be observed in road cuts at Daylight Pass on Daylight Pass Road, which becomes State Route 374 a short distance from the pass. Several other similar formations were also laid down.|$|E
5|$|Like all catalysts, enzymes {{increase}} the reaction rate by lowering its activation energy. Some enzymes {{can make their}} conversion of substrate to product occur <b>many</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> times faster. An extreme example is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds. Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the equilibrium of a reaction. Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity. Many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and pH.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{investigation}} {{has resulted in}} several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. In the West, belief in a flat Earth was displaced {{by the idea of}} spherical Earth, credited to Pythagoras in the 6th century BC. Earth was further believed {{to be the center of}} the universe until the 16th century when scientists first theorized that it was a moving object, comparable to the other planets in the Solar System. Due to the efforts of influential Christian scholars and clerics such as James Ussher, who sought to determine the age of Earth through analysis of genealogies in Scripture, Westerners before the 19th century generally believed Earth to be a few thousand years old at most. It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at least <b>many</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> years.|$|E

5|$|Sporting {{competitions}} {{have always}} provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the {{players from the}} audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in stadium and auditorium design, {{as well as in}} recording and broadcast technology, have allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and spectator sport has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are association football and cricket. Their ultimate international competitions, the World Cup and test cricket, are broadcast around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for <b>many</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> non-players worldwide. A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the Tour de France, unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.|$|E

25|$|Geochronology is {{the science}} of {{determining}} the absolute age of rocks, fossils, and sediments {{by a variety of}} techniques.
