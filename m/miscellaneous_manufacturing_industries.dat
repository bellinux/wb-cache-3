This database provides the relevant data on Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China, and the USA. Because TFP data are not available for a few industries in Taiwan, we removed Taiwan from the study and only constructed innovation input–output matrices for Japan, Korea, China, and the USA. The data cover the years 1980 – 2000 for most countries. We selected 15 sectors consisting of chemicals, petroleum and coal products, leather, stone/clay/glass, primary metal, fabricated metal, machinery, electrical machinery, motor vehicles, transportation equipment and ordnance, instruments, rubber and <b>miscellaneous</b> plastics, <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>manufacturing,</b> transportation, and communication.

The main objective of this research is to calculate the pollution rate caused by the activities of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>industry</b> sector and also <b>manufacturing</b> <b>industry</b> sector behavior in 1990 and 1995. So in turn it can be determined, which <b>manufacturing</b> <b>industry</b> sub sector needs to be noticed more By finding out the sub sector that contributes more to the pollution rate, the pollution rate can be decreased. Analysis applied is the Industrial Pollution Projection System (IPPS), which is developed by World Bank.

Based on calculation result, it can be concluded that there is a change on the most pollution contribution of the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>industry</b> sub sector from 1990 until 1995. The most pollute sectors for 1995 which pollutants of air are coded ISIC 3692, 3411, 3710, 3530 and 3540. The sectors, which pollutants of water are, coded ISIC 3710, 3411, 3720, 3511 and 3522.
