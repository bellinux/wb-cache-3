5|$|Until the Industrial Revolution, Tyldesley was rural, {{agriculture}} and cottage spinning and weaving, mainly <b>muslin</b> and fustian, were the chief occupations before 1800. Silk weaving {{became an important}} cottage industry after 1827 when silk was brought from Manchester.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of its medieval glory, Dhaka was {{regarded}} as one of the wealthiest and most prosperous cities in the world. It served as the capital of the Bengal province of the Mughal Empire twice (1608–39 and 1660–1704). The city's name was Jahangir Nagar (City of Jahangir) in the 17th century. It was central to the economy of Mughal Bengal, which generated 50% of Mughal GDP. It was a cosmopolitan commercial center and the hub of the worldwide <b>muslin</b> and silk trade.|$|E
5|$|East coast trade hummed, with goods {{arriving}} from Golkonda where rice, millet, pulses and tobacco were grown {{on a large}} scale. Dye crops of indigo and chay root were produced for the weaving industry. A mineral rich region, Machilipatnam was the gateway for high quality iron and steel exports. Diamond mining {{was active in the}} Kollur region. The cotton weaving industry produced two types of cottons, plain calico and <b>muslin</b> (brown, bleached or dyed). Cloth printed with coloured patterns crafted by native techniques were exported to Java and the Far East. Golkonda specialised in plain cotton and Pulicat in printed. The main imports on the east coast were non-ferrous metals, camphor, porcelain, silk and luxury goods.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were many}} hand loom weavers in Anderton in the 19th century. British <b>muslins</b> were first {{manufactured}} at Anderton in 1764, {{and that there}} in 1782 were {{for the first time}} in England produced 'the Balasore handkerchiefs, the jaconet and japanned <b>muslins</b> in the style of India.|$|R
50|$|The <b>muslins</b> {{used in this}} {{industry}} came largely from local mills: the first cotton mills had been built in west Scotland in the 1770s, and by the 1780s the quality was high enough to supply the demand for fine white <b>muslins,</b> which became de rigueur to achieve the neo-classical style of dress.|$|R

5|$|Other realist novels by Moore {{from this}} period include A Drama in <b>Muslin</b> (1886), a satiric story of the {{marriage}} trade in Anglo-Irish society that hints at same-sex relationships among the unmarried daughters of the gentry, and Esther Waters (1894), {{the story of an}} unmarried housemaid who becomes pregnant and is abandoned by her footman lover. Both of these books have remained almost constantly in print since their first publication. His 1887 novel A Mere Accident is an attempt to merge his symbolist and realist influences. He also published a collection of short stories: Celibates (1895).|$|E
5|$|Still {{photographs}} of Oheka Castle in Huntington, New York, {{were used in}} the opening montage, representing Kane's Xanadu estate. Ferguson also designed statues from Kane's collection with styles ranging from Greek to German Gothic. The sets were also built to accommodate Toland's camera movements. Walls were built to fold and furniture could quickly be moved. The film's famous ceilings were made out of <b>muslin</b> fabric and camera boxes were built into the floors for low angle shots. Welles later said that he was proud that the film production value looked much more expensive than the film's budget. Although neither worked with Welles again, Toland and Ferguson collaborated in several films in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Dhaka {{suffered}} stagnation {{and decline}} began during the mid 19th-century. Its <b>muslin</b> industry {{was destroyed by}} high colonial taxation, restriction of trade and forced imports of British manufactured textiles. The city's weavers starved to death during Bengal famines. The rise of the colonial capital Calcutta caused {{a sharp decline in}} the city's population. Dhaka became heavily impoverished. In 1824, an Anglican bishop described Dhaka as a city of magnificent ruins. During the mutiny of 1857, the city witnessed revolts by the Bengal Army. The British Indian rule was established following the mutiny. It bestowed privileges on the Dhaka Nawab Family, which dominated the city's political and social elite. The Dhaka Cantonment was established as a base for the British Indian Army. The British developed the modern city around Ramna, Shahbag Garden and Bahadur Shah Park. A modern civic water system was introduced in 1874. The electricity supply began in 1901.|$|E

5|$|Stern shot Changeling in {{anamorphic}} format on {{35mm film}} using Kodak Vision 500T 5279 film stock. The film was shot on Panavision cameras and C-Series lenses. Due {{to the large}} number of sets, the lighting rigs were more extensive than on other Eastwood productions. The crew made several ceilings from bleached <b>muslin</b> tiles. Stern lit the tiles from above to produce a soft, warm light that was intended to evoke the period through tones close to antique and sepia. The crew segregated the tiles using fire safety fabric Duvatyn to prevent light spilling onto neighboring clusters. The key light was generally softer to match the warm tones given off by the toplights. Stern used stronger skypans—more intense than is commonly used for key lighting—to reduce contrasts when applying daytime rain effects, as a single light source tended to produce harder shadows.|$|E
5|$|The Rashtrakuta {{economy was}} {{sustained}} by its natural and agricultural produce, its manufacturing revenues and moneys gained from its conquests. Cotton {{was the chief}} crop of the regions of southern Gujarat, Khandesh and Berar. Minnagar, Gujarat, Ujjain, Paithan and Tagara were important centres of textile industry. <b>Muslin</b> cloth were manufactured in Paithan and Warangal. The cotton yarn and cloth was exported from Bharoch. White calicos were manufactured in Burhanpur and Berar and exported to Persia, Turkey, Poland, Arabia and Egypt. The Konkan region, ruled by the feudatory Silharas, produced large quantities of betel leaves, coconut and rice while the lush forests of Mysore, ruled by the feudatory Gangas, produced such woods as sandal, timber, teak and ebony. Incense and perfumes were exported from the ports of Thana and Saimur.|$|E
5|$|The caravan trade {{depended}} on patrons and merchants. Patrons owned the {{land on which}} the caravan animals were raised, providing animals and guards for the merchants. The lands were located in the numerous villages of the Palmyrene countryside. Although merchants used the patrons to conduct business, their roles often overlapped and a patron would sometimes lead a caravan. Commerce made Palmyra and its merchants among the wealthiest in the region. Some caravans were financed by a single merchant, such as Male' Agrippa (who financed Hadrian's visit in 129 and the 139 rebuilding of the Temple of Bel). The primary income-generating trade good was silk, which was exported from the East to the West. Other exported goods included jade, <b>muslin,</b> spices, ebony, ivory and precious stones. For its domestic market Palmyra imported variety of goods including slaves, prostitutes, olive oil, dyed goods, myrrh and perfume.|$|E

5|$|The first tournament {{provided}} two winners, {{both of whom}} therefore {{qualified for}} the UEFA Cup in the 1995–96 season, with Frenchman Jacky Duguépéroux and Yugoslavian Slavoljub <b>Muslin</b> as the winning managers. From the following season to the 2005 contest, three teams were awarded Intertoto Cups, with French managers being the most successful. In 2006, the format was modified to allow eleven clubs {{to qualify for the}} second qualifying round of the UEFA Cup, the Intertoto Cup being awarded to the team that progressed the furthest in the competition. Englishman Glenn Roeder lifted the cup that season as he guided Newcastle United to the last 16 of the 2006–07 UEFA Cup. German Jupp Heynckes is the only man to have won the cup twice and did so in consecutive years (2003 and 2004) with German club Schalke 04.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit of}} {{blackcurrants}} can be eaten raw, {{but it has}} a strong, tart flavour. It can be made into jams and jellies which set readily because of the fruit's high content of pectin and acid. For culinary use, the fruit is usually cooked with sugar to produce a purée, which can then be passed through <b>muslin</b> to separate the juice. The purée {{can be used to make}} blackcurrant preserves and be included in cheesecakes, yogurt, ice cream, desserts, sorbets and many other sweet dishes. The exceptionally strong flavour can be moderated by combining it with other fruits, such as raspberries and strawberries in summer pudding, or apples in crumbles and pies. The juice can be used in syrups and cordials. Blackcurrants are a common ingredient of Rødgrød, a popular kissel-like dessert in North German and Danish cuisines.|$|E
5|$|During the 1880s, Moore {{began work}} {{on a series of}} novels in a realist style. His first novel, A Modern Lover (1883) was a three-volume work, as {{preferred}} by the circulating libraries, and deals with the art scene of the 1870s and 1880s in which many characters are identifiably real. The circulating libraries in England banned the book because of its explicit portrayal of the amorous pursuits of its hero. At this time the British circulating libraries, such as Mudie's Select Library, controlled the market for fiction and the public, who paid fees to borrow their books, expected them to guarantee the morality of the novels available. His next book, a novel in the realist style, A Mummers Wife (1885) was also regarded as unsuitable by Mudie's and W H Smith refused to stock it on their news-stalls. Despite this, during its first year of publication the book was in its fourteenth edition mainly due to the publicity stirred up by its opponents. The French newspaper Le Voltaire published it in serial form as La Femme du cabotin in July–October 1886. His next novel A Drama in <b>Muslin</b> was banned by Mudie's and Smith's. In response Moore declared war on the circulating libraries by publishing two provocative pamphlets; Literature at Nurse and Circulating Morals. In these, he complained that the libraries profit from salacious popular fiction while refusing to stock serious literary fiction.|$|E

50|$|Indian {{textiles}} were traded {{from ancient}} times with China, Southeast Asia and the Roman Empire. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea mentions mallow cloth, <b>muslins</b> and coarse cottons. Port towns like Masulipatnam and Barygaza won fame for its production of <b>muslins</b> and fine cloth. Trade with the Arabs who were middlemen in the spice trade between India and Europe brought Indian textiles into Europe, {{where it was}} favored by royalty in the 17th-18th century. The Dutch, French and British East India Companies competed for monopoly of the spice trade in the Indian Ocean, but were posed {{with the problem of}} payment for spices, which was in gold or silver. To counter this problem, bullion was sent to India to trade for the textiles, a major portion of which were subsequently traded for spices in other trade posts, which then were traded along with the remaining textiles in London. Printed Indian calicos, chintz, <b>muslins</b> and patterned silk flooded the English market and in time the designs were copied onto imitation prints by English textile manufacturers, reducing the dependence on India.|$|R

That first game ended in defeat, and Žigić's physical appearance– a growth spurt {{from the age of}} 16 had brought his height to – provoked suggestions that he might be better suited to basketball. He scored the second goal as they beat Hajduk Kula 2–0 in the next league match. In between, he produced a hat-trick against Nistru in the 2003–04 UEFA Cup qualifying round, and went on to contribute a further three goals as Red Star beat Odense 6–5 on aggregate in the first round. He scored twice in the 3–0 win in the Eternal Derby against Partizan, and celebrated by miming a basketball shot. By the mid-season break, he had 12 league goals as well as the 6 in the UEFA Cup, and was named Player of the Year for 2003, both by the captains of the First League teams voting via the Večernje novosti newspaper and by the Football Association. He finished the season as the league's top scorer, with 18, as Red Star won their 23rd title, and scored the winning goal in the cup final.|$|E
