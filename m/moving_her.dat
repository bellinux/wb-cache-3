5|$|After the {{war there}} were several plans (Project 27) to {{reconstruct}} Petropavlovsk, as she was now known, using the bow of Frunze and <b>moving</b> <b>her</b> third turret to the forward position, {{but they were not}} accepted and were formally cancelled on 29 June 1948. She was renamed Volkhov, after the nearby river, on 28 November 1950 and served as a stationary training ship until stricken on 4 September 1953 and broken up afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In early 2010, Salzgeber {{announced}} {{that she would be}} <b>moving</b> <b>her</b> base of training from the stables in Bad Worishofen where she had been located since she graduated from college. The new facilities, nearby in Blonhofen, Bavaria, offered more room and extensive natural therapy facilities, including aquatherapy, acupuncture, osteopathy, and homeopathics. Salzgeber said the new, larger, base would allow her to give more training clinics and accept more students.|$|E
5|$|The show's puppeteers claim {{there are}} {{different}} problems working with different characters. For example, Destiny is the largest puppet and so <b>moving</b> <b>her</b> is more difficult. As Marion {{spends much of his}} time sitting on top of a rubbish bin, his puppeteer, Brownlow-Pike, has to stand inside a bottomless bin for long periods of time. Kali is said to be the most difficult puppet to work with, because as she has no hands she is limited to what she can hold.|$|E

5|$|In early 2001, Boisselier {{promised the}} cloning {{of a human}} child within a year, drawing further {{attention}} to her work. A prosecutor in New York began investigating her compliance with local medical laws. Boisselier said that the Food and Drug Administration also surreptitiously investigated her, and Raël claimed that U.S. President George W. Bush was concerned about Clonaid's work. The caretaker of the laboratory that Hunt had rented grew suspicious about their work and contacted law enforcement. They spoke with the FDA, who searched the site and persuaded Boisselier to suspend her cloning work pending legal clarification. After Hunt {{was asked by the}} laboratory's caretaker to shut down the cloning operation, he broke with Boisselier and criticized her for seeking media attention. The caretaker also spoke publicly, saying that Boisselier was seldom at the laboratory. Boisselier then announced that she was <b>moving</b> <b>her</b> cloning operations overseas. Boisselier never faced any legal charges in connection with the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|In late 2005 the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) {{threatened}} action {{over the}} holding in captivity of Mercedes, then Britain's only polar bear. The zoo had initially planned to retire their polar bear exhibit after Mercedes died. When zoo officials {{announced plans to}} create a new attraction, citing their responsibility to ensure the survival of the species, the ALF threatened damage to zoo workers' property and other scare-tactics. Edinburgh's treatment of polar bears had often been subject to criticism, punctuated by incidents like the death in 1997 of Mercedes' partner Barney, who choked on a plastic child's toy thrown into his enclosure. In 2009 the zoo carried out their plans {{to create a new}} exhibit and improve conditions for Mercedes, <b>moving</b> <b>her</b> to the Highland Wildlife Park, where she was joined by a young male polar bear named Walker. Mercedes was euthanized on compassionate grounds in 2011, suffering from severe arthritis.|$|E
5|$|Sarah {{was about}} fifteen when Churchill {{returned}} from the Continent in 1675, and {{he appears to have}} been almost immediately captivated by her charms and considerable good looks. Churchill's amorous, almost abject, missives of devotion were, it seems, received with suspicion – his first lover, Barbara Villiers, was just <b>moving</b> <b>her</b> household to Paris, feeding doubts that he may well have been looking at Sarah as a replacement mistress rather than a fiancée. However, his persistent courtship over the coming months eventually won over the beautiful, if relatively poor, Maid of Honour. Although Winston wished his son to marry the wealthy Catherine Sedley (if only to ease his own burden of debt), Colonel Churchill married Sarah sometime in the winter of 1677–78, possibly in the apartments of the Duchess of York.|$|E

5|$|The Council's {{preference}} for Strathfield {{as a permanent}} location for the school was not shared {{by most of the}} school community, and after an intervention by the Education Trust of the NSW General Assembly it was decided that PLC would reopen once again at Croydon in first term 1946. The military agreed to pay for the extensive renovations that were required, with the final cheque handed over by the government on 21 March 1949. Lauriston and Welbeck were disposed of in 1946, but the Lingwood property was retained as a preparatory school. The Council negotiated with Margaret Thompson, the owner and principal of Branxton, a private school in Strathfield, about <b>moving</b> <b>her</b> school to the Lingwood property, where it would retain the name Branxton and come {{under the control of the}} PLC Council.|$|E

25|$|As US forces moved ever {{north and}} west, {{supplies}} {{had to be}} moved into new advance bases, and Grumium sailed 14 January 1945, to bring up aviation supplies from Manus to Ulithi. Then she made a similar voyage to Roi Island before <b>moving</b> <b>her</b> supply base to Guam 16 March 1945. The ship was soon to carry her support activities to the assault area itself, however, and rendezvoused with an Okinawa-bound convey at Saipan 23 March.|$|E
25|$|The National Football League (NFL) {{was also}} {{interested}} in placing a team at the Met.

The Cardinals moved two of their regular season home games against the Philadelphia Eagles (October 25) (att: 20,112) and New York Giants (November 22) (att: 26,625) to Bloomington for the 1959 NFL season. A preseason football game was held each year at the Met from 1956 to 1960.|$|E
25|$|Kvitová also {{possesses}} notable {{amount of}} variety in her game. Her volleys {{tend to come}} more from her forehand, her stronger side, which she executes by <b>moving</b> <b>her</b> racket in a straight line, also allowing her to disguise the shot well enough from her opponents. In the slice department, she {{has the ability to}} keep the ball low and performs the shot better on her backhand wing. Due to her tall frame, she is known to make up for her lack of speed by playing close to the baseline. Her game suits the fast courts and she cites grass as her favourite surface.|$|E
