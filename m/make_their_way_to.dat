After 12 days, the adult fleas <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> back <b>to</b> the mother. They complete this mini-migration every time she gives birth.|$|R

5|$|In literature, Portsmouth is {{the chief}} {{location}} for Jonathan Meades' 1993 novel Pompey, {{in which it is}} inhabited largely by incestuous and necrophiliac criminals.

5|$|Most {{terrestrial}} caecilians {{that lay}} eggs {{do so in}} burrows or moist places on land near bodies of water. The development of the young of Ichthyophis glutinosus, a species from Sri Lanka, has been much studied. The eel-like larvae hatch out of the eggs and <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> water. They have three pairs of external red feathery gills, a blunt head with two rudimentary eyes, a lateral line system and a short tail with fins. They swim by undulating their body from side to side. They are mostly active at night, soon lose their gills and make sorties onto land. Metamorphosis is gradual. By the age of about ten months they have developed a pointed head with sensory tentacles near the mouth and lost their eyes, lateral line systems and tails. The skin thickens, embedded scales develop and the body divides into segments. By this time, the caecilian has constructed a burrow and is living on land.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, when President Lincoln {{called for}} 75,000 troops in {{response}} to the attack on Fort Sumter, the 5th Massachusetts was ordered by Massachusetts Governor John A.

On April 19, pro-secessionist rioters in Baltimore attacked the 6th Massachusetts as that regiment attempted to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Washington. Alarmed by the escalation in violence, Andrew summoned the 5th Massachusetts to Boston to prepare for departure. The first companies arrived in Boston that same day on April 19. By April 20 the remaining companies reported and the regiment was prepared to depart. That night, the unit barracked in Faneuil Hall and departed for Virginia on April 21, 1861.|$|E
