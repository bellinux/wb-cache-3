An updated <b>model</b> <b>by</b> Matt Meselson and Charley Radding in 1975 introduced {{the idea of}} branch migration. Further observations in the 1980s led to the proposal of alternate mechanisms for recombination such as the double-strand break <b>model</b> (<b>by</b> Jack Szostak, Frank Stahl, and others) and the single-strand annealing model. A third, the synthesis-dependent strand annealing model, did not involve Holliday junctions.|$|E

His hand, resting on a globe, is obscured by the gown: a literal presentation of Smith's famous metaphor of the invisible hand.

We study the performance of channelized cellular systems <b>modeled</b> <b>by</b> hypergraphs in comparison with those <b>modeled</b> <b>by</b> graphs.
