40|$|The {{microbiological}} and metabolic {{changes of}} an overweight-associated colonic microbiota after reducing in vitro the carbohydrate supply and its supplementation with oligosaccharides derived from lactulose (OsLu) were evaluated using a dynamic simulator of the gastrointestinal tract. The differentiation {{and stability of}} the microbial communities within each colon compartment were reached {{after two weeks of}} feeding the system with a high energy (HE) medium based on fructose and readily fermentable starches. The effect of reducing the energy content (low-energy <b>medium,</b> <b>LE)</b> and the supplementation with OsLu caused minor variations in bacterial counts, except for Enterobacteriaceae. The LE medium caused an effect on the microbial metabolic activity that was characterized by an absence of net butyrate production and an increase in ammonium content. This shift from fermentative to proteolytic metabolism was not observed when the LE medium was supplemented with OsLu. This oligosaccharide mixture was mainly metabolized in the proximal colonic compartment. The results obtained in this study indicate that the substitution in the diet of easily digestible carbohydrates by OsLu maintains the fermentative functionality of the intestinal microbiota, allowing the net production of butyric acid with potential beneficial effects on health, and avoiding a full transition to proteolytic metabolism profiles.

Qu’en est-il de la « présence » théâtrale à l’égard d’un <b>médium</b> comme <b>le</b> cinéma, où tout est « reproductible » (Benjamin) ? Si la théâtralité était liée non seulement à une présence ambiguë, mais aussi à la {{fonction}} de localisation, il deviendrait possible de repenser son rapport au cinéma en termes de cadrage.

What {{is the meaning}} of theater, and in particular of theatricality, in a world dominated by electronic media?

Informed by such considerations, this text interprets the relationship between theater and cinema in some recent films, in particular Being John Malkovich and eXistenZ, in order to suggest that theatricality plays an increasingly important part in a universe fascinated by "the media"...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMultistability is an {{emergent}} dynamic {{property that}} has been invoked to explain multiple coexisting biological states. In this work, we investigate the origin of bistability in the lac operon. To do this, we develop a mathematical model for the regulatory pathway in this system and compare the model predictions with other experimental results in which a nonmetabolizable inducer was employed. We investigate the effect of lactose metabolism using this model, and show that it greatly modifies the bistable region in the external lactose (Le) versus external glucose (Ge) parameter space. The model also predicts that lactose metabolism can cause bistability to disappear for very low Ge. We have also carried out stochastic numerical simulations of the model for several values of Ge and Le. Our results indicate that bistability can help guarantee that Escherichia coli consumes glucose and lactose in the most efficient possible way. Namely, the lac operon is induced only when {{there is almost no}} glucose in the growing <b>medium,</b> but if <b>Le</b> is high, the operon induction level increases abruptly when the levels of glucose in the environment decrease to very low values. We demonstrate that this behavior could not be obtained without bistability if the stability of the induced and uninduced states is to be preserved. Finally, we point out that the present methods and results may be useful to study the emergence of multistability in biological systems other than the lac operon...|$|R
40|$|Multiplayer games users' have {{increased}} since {{the widespread use}} of the internet. Withthe arrival of rich portable devices and faster cellular wireless networks, multiplayer games on mobile phones and PDAs are becoming a reality. For multiplayer games to be playable, they should be highly interactive, fair and should have a consistent state for all the players. Because of the high wireless network latency and jitters, the issue of providing interactive games with consistent state across the network is non-trivial. In this thesis, we propose different approaches for achieving consistency in mobile multiplayer games in the face of high latency and large and variable jitters. Although absolute consistency is impossible to achieve because information takes time to travel from one place to another, we exploit the fact that strong consistency is not always required in the virtual world and can be relaxed in many cases. Our proposed approach uses the underlying network latency and the position of different objects in the virtual world to decide when to relax consistency and when to apply strong consistency mechanisms. We evaluate our approach by implementing these algorithms in J 2 ME based games played on mobile phones. The algorithms for consistency mechanism are very complex and are often intermixed with the game core logic's code, which makes it hard to program a game and to change its code in the future. We propose to separate the consistency mechanisms from the game logic {{and put them in a}} distributed component responsible for both consistency maintenance and communication over the network. We call this reusable component a Synchronization <b>Medium.</b> Dans <b>les</b> jeux multijoueurs, où plusieurs joueurs participent à une même partie et communiquent entre eux à travers un réseau, les joueurs peuvent avoir des visions différentes du jeu en raison des délais de communication. Ceci engendre des incohérences encore plus importantes sur les réseaux mobiles tels que les réseaux 3 G où les délais de communication peuvent atteindre plusieurs secondes. Des algorithmes doivent donc être mis en place pour maintenir la cohérence entre les joueurs. Ces algorithmes sont assez complexes et difficiles à programmer et mettre au point. Le but de cette thèse est de proposer une architecture logicielle qui découple la conception du jeu, de ses besoins de communication en proposant une infrastructure de communication qui pourra être interchangeable en fonction des technologies; cette infrastructure prend la forme originale d'un composant de synchronisation. Ainsi, les conséquences des propriétés physiques du transport des informations pourront être plus ou moins masquées en intégrant dans cette infrastructure les algorithmes adéquats...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{was conducted on the}} Brekete Gatsi cult in Ghana to investigate the use of the body in action during the dance in the ritual context. Brekete is a possession cult found among the Ewe’s of the Volta Region-Ghana. Devotees in this cult worship the deities Kunde and Ablewa on every Friday, Sunday and during ceremonial days. They also propitiate other pantheons who are children of Kunde and Ablewa. During ritual moments they call on these deities, who manifest themselves by embodying trained mediums to enter into an act of communion with the religious community. This state of embodiment is manipulated by rhythms paralleled with ritual sacrifices and dance which the community believes attains efficacy through possession. Therefore, this article will discuss the role of two dances which are performed during the ritual of the cult. Both dances occur during the same ritual events but may be distinguished by the fact that one of them is accompanied by possession and the other is not. I have therefore labelled them as Wu (Dance) and Trɔwo le ewu du (deities are dancing). It is through the analysis of these dances that it is possible for the reader to understand the relationship between the mundane world and the supernatural world of the people who perform in this cult. The methodology used has been that of classical anthropological research approach and more particularly of participant observation of events of which I had no prior knowledge due to my Christian urban upbringing. I wish to highlight the exoticism of the experience for a researcher who, despite his own upbringing, tackled a different religious phenomenon irrespective of his social and religious affiliations. Thus, with my focus on the bodily actions and how they are used to gain access into the celestial world, I identify dance as an instrument and a medium by which the physical evidence of possession comes about. To that effect, and through the phenomenon that religious possession dance is laden with complexities and meaning, this article will hereby develop how the ritual processes and the differences between the movement of “Wu and Trɔwo le ewu du” teaches us about the ritual efficacy of possession dance. I argue here that both possession dance and the dance without possession (i) are contra-kinetically constructed, (ii) have movement sequences employing sagittal symmetrical principles, and (iii) although they have limited motifs of the steps and arm gesture, the possession dance has many variations. Finally, the Wu serves as a prelude to Trɔ di amedzi (deity has embodied or mounted its <b>medium)</b> and Trɔwo <b>le</b> ewu du, which has the concept of possession among the Brekete Gatsi cult based on the philosophy of repetitive motif characterised by intense energy, rhythmic tempo and musicality (multidi-mensional, accentuation and phrasing) from the brekete drum...|$|R
