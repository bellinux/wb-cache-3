George gets drunk at a local bar and {{is involved in a}} fight before he leaves and goes to a nearby bridge, thinking of suicide. The film's narrative catches up to the time of the opening scene. Before he can jump, Clarence dives into the river just before George does, causing George to rescue Clarence rather than killing himself. George does not believe Clarence's subsequent claim to be his guardian angel.|$|E
25|$|Other stories {{say that}} Asclepius was killed because after {{bringing}} people {{back from the}} dead, Hades thought that no <b>more</b> <b>dead</b> spirits {{would come to the}} underworld, so he asked his brother Zeus to stop him. This angered Apollo who in turn killed the Cyclopes who made the thunderbolts for Zeus. For this act, Zeus suspended Apollo from the night sky and commanded Apollo to serve Admetus, King of Thessaly for a year. Once the year had passed, Zeus brought Apollo back to Mount Olympus and revived the Cyclopes that made his thunderbolts. After Asclepius's death, Zeus placed his body among the stars as the constellation Ophiuchus ("the Serpent Holder").|$|E

Plagued by the hot climate, mosquitos and illnesses and conscious that the broad river extended upwards, the expedition continued south. Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada was convinced they would reach the lands full of gold they heard about at the Caribbean coast and motivated his delegation of soldiers, that at this time had an average age of 27 years old, to walk on.|$|E

25|$|Riparian {{zones are}} {{characterized}} by a distinct community of plant species that are physiologically adapted to a greater amount of freshwater than upland species. In addition to having frequent direct contact with surface water through periodic rises in stream water levels and flooding, riparian zones are also characterized by their proximity to groundwater. Particularly in arid regions, shallow groundwater, seeps, and springs provides a more constant source of water to riparian vegetation than occasional flooding. By reducing the availability of water, groundwater withdrawals can impact the health of riparian vegetation. For example, Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), and San Joaquin willow (Salix gooddingii), common riparian species in Arizona, {{were found to have}} <b>more</b> <b>dead</b> branches and experienced greater mortality with decreasing groundwater levels.|$|E
25|$|Returning in {{strength}} the next day, the Australians swept {{the area and}} located {{a large number of}} Viet Cong dead. Although the Australians initially believed they had suffered a major defeat, the scale of the Viet Cong's losses revealed that they had actually won a significant victory. Over the next two days, they continued to clear the battlefield, uncovering <b>more</b> <b>dead</b> as they did so. Yet with 1 ATF lacking the resources to pursue the withdrawing force, the operation ended on 21 August. Eighteen Australians were killed and 24 wounded, while the Viet Cong lost at least 245 dead. A decisive Australian victory, Long Tan proved a major local setback for the Viet Cong, indefinitely forestalling an imminent movement against Nui Dat. Although there were other large-scale encounters in later years, 1 ATF was not fundamentally challenged again. The battle established the task force's dominance over the province and allowed it to pursue operations to restore government authority.|$|E
25|$|Besides winning {{two more}} Futures doubles titles in three finals in Irun and Espinho, Sousa reached his first four singles finals {{at the same}} level in 2009. He won the title in the La Palma final. At the Estoril Open, Sousa was granted a wild card to {{participate}} in his first doubles ATP World Tour level tournament, but lost in the first round. During 2009, Sousa was twice called to the Portugal Davis Cup team, winning both singles dead rubbers he took part in – over Philippos Tsangaridis from Cyprus in March and Algeria's Sid-Ali Akkal in July. In 2010, Sousa won his first Challenger title at the Tampere's doubles tournament in August. In the 2010 season, Sousa did not enter any ATP tournament; he began shifting his schedule increasingly from the Futures circuit to the Challenger tour. He was more successful in the Futures, winning three singles titles in four finals at Valldoreix, Tenerife and Lanzarote, and doubles titles in Lanzarote, Córdoba and two in Tenerife. At the Davis Cup, Sousa played two <b>more</b> <b>dead</b> rubbers, winning {{for the second time in}} three seasons over Cyprus' Christou and losing to Bosnian Damir Džumhur.|$|E

25|$|The Australians {{returned}} in strength the next day, sweeping {{the area and}} locating {{a large number of}} Viet Cong dead. Although initially believing they had suffered a major defeat, as the scale of the Viet Cong's losses were revealed it became clear they had won a significant victory. Two wounded Viet Cong were killed after they moved to engage the Australians, while three were captured. The bodies of the missing from 11 Platoon were also located. Two men had survived despite their wounds, having spent the night in close proximity to the Viet Cong as they attempted to evacuate their own casualties. Due to the likely presence of a sizeable force nearby the Australians remained cautious as they searched for the Viet Cong. Over the next two days they continued to clear the battlefield, uncovering <b>more</b> <b>dead</b> as they did so. Yet with 1 ATF lacking the resources to pursue the withdrawing force, the operation ended on 21 August. Heavily outnumbered but supported by strong artillery fire, D Company held off a regimental assault before a relief force of cavalry and infantry fought their way through and forced the Viet Cong to withdraw. Eighteen Australians were killed and 24 wounded, while the Viet Cong lost at least 245 dead which were found over the days that followed. A decisive Australian victory, Long Tan proved a major local setback for the Viet Cong, indefinitely forestalling an imminent movement against Nui Dat and establishing the task force's dominance over the province. Although there were other large-scale encounters in later years, 1 ATF was not fundamentally challenged again.|$|E

[...] Robert K.

[...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three and a half stars out of five, saying [...] "In the guise of a family film, Burton evokes a darkly erotic obsession that recalls Edgar Allan Poe and Hitchcock's Vertigo.
