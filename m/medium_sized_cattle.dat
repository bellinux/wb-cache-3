40|$|In {{this thesis}} I examine {{household}} (re) production {{within the framework}} of the neoliberal economic and political policies as they have been, and continue to be experienced by small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>cattle</b> ranchers within the Guanacaste province of Costa Rica. In so doing, this analysis moves away from purely macro, structural and economic analysis of development, which have long been held as the principle unit of discourse within the various attempts to come to grips with theories of development. To do this I argue that by placing an analysis of culture and hegemony within the wider framework of development theory one will be better able to grasp the creative responses of rural peoples based upon their individual and group experiences with the processes of 2 ̆ 7 development 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 modernization 2 ̆ 7.

40|$|The Nguni. an indigenous, {{small to}} <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> <b>cattle</b> breed of eastern and {{northern}} South Africa is well adapted to low quality feed, {{has a high}} degree of tick resistance, is docile, early maturing and fertile. It is also a typical multi-purpose animal, used for meat, milk, leather, draught, saving account, as well as various socio-cultural functions. Because of its heterogeneity in colour, hornshape and confirmation Nguni were rejected as “scrub ” by the great majority of white settlers. After being told that Ngunis are inferior cattle, communal farmers started to believe that and started crossbreeding their cattle with cattle from commercial farms. More recently scientists and commercial farmers have developed an interest in Nguni as low external input breed. A breed society has been formed almost 20 years ago. A recent book on the meaning of Nguni colour pattern became a best-seller. A study of animal husbandry practices in communal areas of KwaZulu-Natal for two development project brought to light the lack of current information among communal farmers. Farmers were rather sceptible with respect to Ngunis, and presently keep a crosses with commercial breeds. The promised higher productivity does not materialize, particularly because of insuffient feed., but a visit to a stud farm or even showing a booklet on South African breeds already created some interest. The development projects are now looking for ways to promote Nguni cattle among. Possibilities include communal bull-keeping, or even AI, depending on local circumstances...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyse type traits in 1, 086 first-calving Cika cows. Statistical model was {{analysed}} by GLM procedure in SAS/STAT statistical package, which included the fixed effect of scoring year, and age at scoring and days after calving as linear regressions. First-calving cows were on average 126. 5 cm high at the withers at the age of 33. 9 months, which clearly shows that it belongs to small to <b>medium</b> body <b>sized</b> <b>cattle.</b> The largest proportion of the variability was explained in the measured traits of the body frame (0. 14 – 0. 17). The explained proportion of variability among individual traits of autochthonous was between 0. 03 and 0. 07, while 0. 12 in the composite trait of autochthonous. We found out that type traits and therefore the classification of animals were significantly affected at least the following effects: the scoring year, age and stage of lactation. Classification of animals into the appropriate type, should therefore, be carried out after exclusion of the environmental effects. This would give a more accurate classification of Cika first-calving cows...|$|R

Environmental capabilities of small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> enterprises are found to be bound to energy efficiency projects, with very few small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> enterprises having a strategic outlook toward developing these capabilities. The majority of small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> enterprises did not access governmental grants to improve energy efficiency, and those who did accessed governmental rather than NGO or private sources. Around a third of small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> enterprises did not invest in any form of Environmental Management System or Environmental Management Accreditation over the last two years. Environmental capabilities, which are considered to have a direct positive impact on cost reduction, are found to be attracting the highest demand from small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> enterprises.

The focus of the paper is on the international diffusion of small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> firms innovations. Small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> firms face two challenges in globalization: property rights protection and barriers to entry. We suggest that these barriers can frequently be circumvented by using existing multinationals as international conduits for small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> firms' innovations. However, such intermediated modes of expansion is adversely affected by transaction difficulties and intermediator's rent extraction. We raise two categories of questions: (i) is the private sector systematically making the wrong choice between the direct and intermediated mode of international expansion? and (ii) What should be the policy guidelines to improve the overall rate of international diffusion of innovation by small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> enterprises...|$|R

Cobb-Douglas production, cost-benefit (C: B) and break-even ratios {{were employed to}} assess resource use efficiency and profitability and financial efficiency of cross and local breed dairy farms. The regression coefficients with respect to concentrate for <b>medium</b> and small <b>size</b> cross breed farms are positive and significant at 10 % level. The coefficient of dry fodder for <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> cross breed and local breed are positive and significant at 10 % level. For small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> local breed farms, the coefficient for dry fodder is positive and significant at 5 % level and labor is positive and significant at 5 % level {{in the case of}} small size cross breed. For small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> local breed farms, the coefficient for miscellaneous are positive and significant at 10 % level. There is difference between the present and optimum levels of inputs. The optimum levels of inputs with respect to concentrate are 30. 21 quintal and 24. 82 quintals for <b>medium</b> and small <b>size</b> cross breed farms, respectively. For dry fodder, the optimum is 32. 70 quintals and 12. 84 quintal for <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> cross and local breed farms, respectively. where as, 8. 88 quintals for small size local breed farms. Green fodder, the optimum level is 10. 88 quintals for <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> local breed farms. The optimum level for labor is 403. 12 man day for small size cross breed farms. For miscellaneous cost the optimum levels are 228. 54 Birr and 336. 47 Birr for <b>medium</b> and small <b>size</b> local bred farms, respectively. The C:B results indicated that cross breed farms were profitable (1. 0 : 3. 02) than local breed farms (1. 0 : 2. 18). Both medium and small categories of cross breed farms were profitable (1. 0 : 3. 45 and 1. 0 : 2. 74, respectively). In local breed <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> farms were profitable (1. 0 : 2. 19). The ratio of break-even milk output from the actual milk production for cross breed and local breed cows owning farms needed 13 % of the actual milk {{production and}} 18 % additional milk production over the actual milk production to cover fixed cost, respectively. Cross breed small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> farms needed 8 % and 11 % milk output and local breed small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> farms requires additional 31 % and 14 % over the actual milk production. In conclusion, dairy cow's owner should be advised to use the optimum levels inputs and replace their indigenous cow with cross breed cow.
