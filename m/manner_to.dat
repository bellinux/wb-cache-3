5|$|In an {{analogous}} <b>manner</b> <b>to</b> zirconium and hafnium, rutherfordium {{is projected to}} form a very stable, refractory oxide, RfO2. It reacts with halogens to form tetrahalides, RfX4, which hydrolyze on contact with water to form oxyhalides RfOX2. The tetrahalides are volatile solids existing as monomeric tetrahedral molecules in the vapor phase.|$|E

5|$|Yellow tea: This tea is {{processed}} {{in a similar}} <b>manner</b> <b>to</b> green tea, but instead of immediate drying after fixation, it is stacked, covered, and gently heated in a humid environment. This initiates oxidation in the chlorophyll of the leaves through non-enzymatic and non-microbial means, which results in a yellowish or greenish-yellow colour.|$|E
5|$|A {{rapid transit}} route to connect Staten Island (alternately known as Richmond County) to the {{remainder}} of New York City was proposed in 1912, {{in conjunction with the}} Dual Contracts of the New York City Subway. At the time, there were no vehicular or rail connections between Staten Island and the other four boroughs; the only connection was by ferry. Although not funded by the city, the tunnel was expected to help expand the then-sparsely populated borough in a similar <b>manner</b> <b>to</b> the population and development explosions seen in Brooklyn and the Bronx.|$|E
5|$|A royal {{charter of}} 1215 gave Wellington {{its status as}} a town, and during the medieval period it grew as a centre for trade on the road from Bristol to Exeter, being laid out, with the church at the east end of town, in a similar <b>manner</b> <b>to</b> other towns of this era. In 1548, the manor was sold to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, but reverted to the control of the bishops after his execution. By the end of the 16th century it had come under the {{protection}} of John Popham (judge) and his descendants who built a manor house which was destroyed during the English Civil War.|$|E
60|$|Berenice, {{arrested in}} her forward movement, watched Mannering's face eagerly. So {{carefully}} modulated had been Borrowdean's voice that no word of his had reached beyond their own immediate circle. It {{was as though}} a silent tableau were being played out between the three, and <b>Mannering,</b> <b>to</b> whom repression had become a habit, gave little indication of anything he might have felt. Borrowdean's fixed smile betokened nothing but an ordinary interest in the introduction of two friends, and the Duchess's back was turned towards her friends. They both waited for <b>Mannering</b> <b>to</b> speak.|$|R

5|$|As bacon {{ice cream}} {{was created in}} 1992 and came to {{prominence}} in the 2000s, there is no traditional recipe. Recipes generally involve adding bacon to a standard sweet ice cream recipe, often vanilla but other suggestions include coffee, rum or pecan. The saltiness of the bacon highlights {{the sweetness of the}} ice cream. According to one Wired.com article, the bacon should be candied prior to addition, a process which involves baking the bacon in a sugar syrup. This has the benefit of sweetening the bacon, in a similar <b>manner</b> <b>to</b> pancakes {{in some parts of the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|As {{characters}} gain experience points their mutant superpowers {{and unique}} abilities can be upgraded. Items found during gameplay {{can also be}} equipped to further enhance a character's abilities. Characters can combine attacks to create a combo, in which two or more players punch or kick a single enemy at the same time. The character's special abilities {{can also be used}} in the same <b>manner</b> <b>to</b> create a Super Combo which inflicts massive damage on enemies. Each character has several mutant powers that players can assign to controller buttons. The game also features a skirmish mode, which allows players to fight against each other or waves of computer-controlled enemies.|$|E
5|$|Cricket {{characters}} {{feature in}} the Walt Disney animated movies Pinocchio (1940), where Jiminy Cricket becomes the title character's conscience, and in Mulan (1998), where Cri-kee is carried in a cage {{as a symbol of}} luck, in the Asian manner. The Crickets was the name of Buddy Holly's rock and roll band; Holly's home town baseball team in the 1990s was called the Lubbock Crickets. Cricket is the name of a US children's literary magazine founded in 1973; it uses a cast of insect characters. The sound of crickets is often used in media to emphasize silence, often for comic effect after an awkward joke, in a similar <b>manner</b> <b>to</b> tumbleweed.|$|E

5|$|De Saulles {{created the}} new florin in this <b>manner</b> <b>to</b> {{distinguish}} the coin from the half crown, as {{there had been}} complaints of confusion. He probably based the design on his British trade dollar (1895). The sitter for the design was Susan Hicks-Beach, the daughter of Michael Hicks-Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn who had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and ex officio Master of the Mint. The modern-day Britannia coinage, bullion pieces struck by the Royal Mint for investors and collectors, has a reverse that strongly resembles that of the Edwardian florin.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{struggles in}} the Test arena, Brown had {{success in the}} tour matches as an opener. He scored 1,448 runs at 57.92 in all {{first-class}} matches, ranking fourth in both the aggregates and averages. He scored eight centuries, second only to Bradman, including 200 against Cambridge University. However, Brown gained criticism for his slow batting. Following his omission from the Test team, Brown batted in a highly circumspect <b>manner</b> <b>to</b> increase the reliability and volume of his scoring. A very occasional off spin bowler, Brown took his career first-class best of 4/16 in his only stint with the ball, against the South of England.|$|E
5|$|Foliot {{possibly}} {{was the son}} of Roger Foliot and {{his wife}} Rohese. Roger held three knight's fees in Northamptonshire. Probably born sometime between 1150 and 1160, Hugh was related in some <b>manner</b> <b>to</b> Robert Foliot, his predecessor at Hereford. He was a canon of Hereford Cathedral before becoming Archdeacon of Shropshire by May 1186. Foliot is a frequent witness on charters as archdeacon, but little else is known of his tenure of the office. From 1212 to 1219, he served as a papal judge-delegate three times. In 1215 he was also King John's candidate for the see of St David's in Wales, but was not elected.|$|E
