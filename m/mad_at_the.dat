I apologize for it / Yo, I can't call it, motherfucking Wyclef spoiled it!"). Said album, 2000 B.C., was also released to mixed feelings and reviews—the latter once more focusing on the lack of topical variety and uninspired production—and also suffered from very little promotion by Universal Records.|$|E

Hancock is invulnerable, immortal, possesses superhuman strength, reflexes and stamina, highly developed regeneration, and can fly at supersonic speeds. He {{is also an}} amnesiac; his first memories are of waking up alone in a hospital in 1931. During his release, the duty nurse asked him for his [...] "John Hancock", which he adopted as his current alias. Smith described the character, [...] "Hancock is not your average superhero. Every day he wakes up <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> world. He doesn't remember {{what happened to him}} and there's no one to help him find the answers." [...] To give a realistic appearance of superhero flight, Smith was often suspended by wires [...] above the ground and propelled at [...], Hancock's character is a parody version of DC's Superman.|$|E
500|$|According to Mills, his housemate in 1946–47, [...] "Dodo was {{the most}} {{dedicated}} of players. He practiced {{an incredible amount of}} hours, often all day long. He wouldn't stop to eat. He would eat at the piano with one hand and keep playing with the other. He had no other interests that I was aware of. He could play forever." [...] At this time, Marmarosa did not drink or take hard drugs, but his behavior was often eccentric. Mills reported that [...] "Dodo was just a big kid [...] He never really grew up because he never allowed anything but the piano to be important to him. The piano was his life. He heard things in his head that he wasn't able to play and it frustrated him. Once, he got <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> old upright piano we had and chopped it up with an axe." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Stop or My Dog Will Shoot" [...] (season 18, 2007), Santa's Little Helper {{becomes a}} local hero after finding a lost Homer, and the Simpsons decide to enroll {{him in the}} Animal Police Academy. However, his new crime-fighting job makes him jaded and one day at home he bites Bart. The Simpsons must {{therefore}} send the dog away to live with officer Lou. However, he gets to return after saving Bart from a toxic smoke cloud at school and then leaving the police force. In [...] "How Munched is That Birdie in the Window?" [...] (season 22, 2010), after Santa's Little Helper devours a pigeon with a broken leg that Bart was nursing, Bart gets <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dog and is unable to forgive him. The Simpsons therefore give him away to an ostrich farm. There, Bart says goodbye to him and explains that he should never, ever devour a bird. Bart then gets into a fight with an angry ostrich. After remembering that {{he was told that}} it's wrong to kill birds, he ceases to aid Bart in the fight, confused at his own loyalty (for Bart's sake or his orders) leaving Bart to strangle the ostrich to death. Bart then realizes that he could not help killing the pigeon and apologizes. Afterwards, the family goes back home with the dog.|$|E

500|$|On tagging {{first base}} after Cabrera's relay, Galarraga began celebrating his accomplishment. His {{immediate}} reaction to Joyce's on-field ruling was a momentary pause {{followed by a}} wry smile at the umpire {{before returning to the}} mound. Galarraga told reporters after the game that the outing [...] "was my best game, so far", and said that Joyce [...] "probably feels more bad than me. Nobody's perfect. Everybody's human. I understand. I give the guy {{a lot of credit for}} saying, 'I need to talk to you.' You don't see an umpire tell you that after a game. I gave him a hug." [...] He also told reporters, [...] "I know that I pitched a perfect game, I believe I got it. I said before, I got a perfect game. I'm going to show my son. Maybe it's not in the book, but I'm going to tell my son, 'One time I got a perfect game.' I'll show him the CD," [...] further calling his effort [...] "the first 28-out perfect game". Tigers' manager Jim Leyland added, [...] "It's a crying shame. Jim [...] is a class guy. This sounds crazy, but after looking at the play, nobody is going to feel worse than he does. I yelled a bit after the game because emotions are high. You just want it so bad for the kid. I don't think you're as <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> umpire as mad the kid didn't get it—and he did deserve it." [...] Leyland also said that Joyce's call was part of the [...] "human element of the game".|$|E

'I don't see why June is so mad over what Beaver's done. I certainly wouldn't be.'

2500|$|The Redskins {{played in}} the NFL Championship one more time before a quarter-century drought that did not end until the 1972 season. With former Olympic gold {{medalist}} Dudley DeGroot as their new head coach, the Redskins went 8–2 during the 1945 season. One {{of the most impressive}} performances came from Sammy Baugh, who had a completion percentage of [...]703. They ended the season by losing to the Cleveland Rams in the 1945 NFL Championship Game on December 16, 1945, 15–14. The one-point margin of victory came under scrutiny because of a safety that occurred early in the game. In the first quarter, the Redskins had the ball at their own 5-yard line. Dropping back into the end zone, quarterback Sammy Baugh threw to an open receiver, but the ball hit the goal post (which at the time was on the goal line instead of {{at the back of the}} end zone) and bounced back to the ground in the end zone. Under the rules at the time, this was ruled as a safety and thus gave the Rams a 2–0 lead. It was that safety that proved to be the margin of victory. Owner Marshall was so <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> outcome that he became a major force in passing the following major rule change after the season: A forward pass that strikes the goal posts is automatically ruled incomplete. This later became known as the [...] "Baugh/Marshall Rule".|$|E
