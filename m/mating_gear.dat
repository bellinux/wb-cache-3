In this paper the stress analysis of <b>mating</b> <b>gears</b> of the spur gear with three different materials is done to determine the contact stresses generated in the gear theeth.

5000|$|Spur {{gear teeth}} are {{manufactured}} by either involute profile or cycloidal profile. Most of the gears are manufactured by involute profile with 20° pressure angle. When two gears are in mesh at one instant {{there is a}} chance to mate involute portion with non-involute portion of <b>mating</b> <b>gear.</b> This phenomenon is known as [...] "interference" [...] and occurs when the number of teeth on the smaller of the two meshing gears is less than a required minimum. To avoid interference we can have undercutting, {{but this is not a}} suitable solution as undercutting leads to weakening of tooth at its base. In this situation Corrected gears are used. In corrected gears Cutter rack is shifted upwards or downwards.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} {{near the}} beginning of the article, the attainment of a nonfluctuating velocity ratio is dependent on the profile of the teeth.Friction and wear between two gears is also dependent on the tooth profile. There are a great many tooth profiles that provides a constant velocity ratio. In many cases, given an arbitrary tooth shape, it is possible to develop a tooth profile for the <b>mating</b> <b>gear</b> that provides a constant velocity ratio. However, two constant velocity tooth profiles are the most commonly used in modern times: the cycloid and the involute. The cycloid was more common until the late 1800s. Since then, the involute has largely superseded it, particularly in drive train applications. The cycloid is in some ways the more interesting and flexible shape; however the involute has two advantages: it is easier to manufacture, and it permits the center-to-center spacing of the gears to vary over some range without ruining the constancy of the velocity ratio. Cycloidal gears only work properly if the center spacing is exactly right. Cycloidal gears are still used in mechanical clocks.|$|E

40|$|Detailed {{studies of}} gear transmissions, such as NVH (Noise Vibration and Harshness) or {{durability}} analyses, require an accurate {{description of the}} contact forces, acting on meshing gear teeth. In order to properly model the contact force between two bodies, an accurate prediction of the contact locations and corresponding penetrations is required, before contact loads can be calculated. This paper proposes a numerically efficient and accurate contact model to calculate the contact locations and penetrations between <b>mating</b> <b>gear</b> flanks by making use of the ease-off concept. The proposed approach exploits the fact that <b>mating</b> <b>gear</b> flanks {{are designed to be}} close-to-conjugate and can account for possible micro-modifications and relative motion between the meshing gear flanks. Furthermore, this paper proposes an extension to the ease-off based contact modeling which enables accounting for misalignments without the need to recalculate the ease-off topography for each new misaligned configuration. In a preprocessing step to the actual contact detection algorithm, the surface of roll angles and ease-off topography for a given gear pair under a given kinematic configuration are calculated, starting from a cloud-of-point representation of the different gears. The use of a cloud-of-point representation, combined with the knowledge of the surface normal vectors, allows for the analysis of different types of gears, without the need of a detailed knowledge of the manufacturing process. Therefore, the created algorithm can account for different gear geometries, ranging from cylindrical gears to bevel and hypoid gears. status: publishe...|$|E

It shows that, if the gear pair is {{controlled}} to provide the corresponding transmission ratio, the electromagnetic actuator will be actuated.

In this way, this <b>mating</b> <b>gear</b> pair can begin to transmit power and motion. Obviously, at the same time, the other gear pairs that have not been locked will also rotate with bearings freely on the shaft.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four papers, which treat the modelling of a spur gear set and a disc brake, and {{the interaction between the}} machine elements. Features of the performance are studied in relation to the initial stated assumptions. Initially, a method for analysing the influence of profile errors upon load-sharing capabilities and mesh stiffness of spur gears was proposed. The contacts between <b>mating</b> <b>gear</b> teeth were identified in the deformed state. In addition, artificial neural networks were employed for system identification. The discussion was focused upon the dependency between the contact ratio and the load in addition to the influence of profile and pitch errors. Experimental data validated the reliability of the approach. Following, a non-linear damping model for shaft torsional vibration studies was proposed and experimentally validated. The experiments showed that the internal shaft damping was highly non-linear. The damping tended to be not only stiffness related but also noticeably depended on the type of material. Friction induced noise due to the interaction of the mating teeth of a spur gear set was studied. For the shaft bearings, a non-linear damping model based upon the coefficient of restitution describing the interaction between the rolling elements and the inner- and outer race of the bearing was proposed. The non-linear support bearing model created a relation between the bearing stiffness in the path of contact of the mating teeth and the movement of the gears perpendicular to the path of contact. The presence of friction had its greatest effect upon the bearing force in the path of contact of the <b>mating</b> <b>gear</b> teeth at low angular velocities, and at mesh frequencies close to the natural frequency of the vibration perpendicular to the path of contact. Finally, the influence of the interaction between the disc of a floating disc brake assembly and connecting members was studied. In the initial process of the experimental research, high drag torque was acquired without applying force to the pads. The spline profile and the nave width were proven to have little effect upon drag, whilst the position on which the caliper was mounted had a considerable influence. Both the analytical study and the experimental measurements showed a strong correlation between the caliper position and the drag torque...|$|E
