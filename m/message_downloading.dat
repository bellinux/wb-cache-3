50|$|At {{its most}} basic, an MUA using POP3 <b>downloads</b> <b>messages</b> from the server mailbox onto the local {{computer}} for {{display in the}} MUA. Messages are generally removed from the server {{at the same time}} but most systems also allow a copy to be left behind as a backup. In contrast, an MUA using IMAP displays messages directly from the server, although a download option for archive purposes is usually also available. One advantage this gives IMAP is that the same messages are visible from any computer accessing the email account, since <b>messages</b> aren't routinely <b>downloaded</b> and deleted from the server. If set up properly, sent mail can be saved to the server also, in contrast with POP mail, where sent messages exist only in the local MUA and are not visible by other MUAs accessing the same account.|$|R
50|$|OzWin {{was born}} out of the earlier OzCIS program which was DOS based. OzWin allowed users to connect to CompuServe forums and batch <b>download</b> <b>{{messages}},</b> files, and so forth from the server and then disconnect. They could then read the messages offline, and as well compose new messages and replies while offline. When they finished reading and composing messages, they could connect again to batch send all of the messages, as well as receive any new messages others had posted to the forums. This allowed users to batch upload and <b>download</b> <b>messages</b> and then work offline, minimising the time they were connected to CompuServe. This was important, since at that time, users were charged by the hour to connect to CompuServe, so remaining connected all the time was an expensive proposition and could quickly run up charges.|$|R

50|$|When using POP, clients {{typically}} {{connect to}} the e-mail server briefly, {{only as long as}} it takes to <b>download</b> new <b>messages.</b> When using IMAP4, clients often stay connected as long as the user interface is active and <b>download</b> <b>message</b> content on demand.

40|$|A private {{information}} retrieval scheme is a mechanism {{that allows a}} user to retrieve any one out of K messages from N non-communicating replicated databases, each of which stores all K messages, without revealing anything about {{the identity of the}} desired message index to any individual database. If the size of each message is L bits and the total download required by a PIR scheme from all N databases is D bits, then D is called the download cost and the ratio L/D is called an achievable rate. For fixed K,N∈N, the capacity of PIR, denoted by C, is the supremum of achievable rates over all PIR schemes and over all message sizes, and was recently shown to be C=(1 + 1 /N+ 1 /N^ 2 + [...] . + 1 /N^K- 1) ^- 1. In this work, for arbitrary K, N, we explore the minimum download cost D_L across all PIR schemes (not restricted to linear schemes) for arbitrary message lengths L under arbitrary choices of alphabet (not restricted to finite fields) for the <b>message</b> and <b>download</b> symbols. If the same M-ary alphabet is used for the <b>message</b> and <b>download</b> symbols, then we show that the optimal download cost in M-ary symbols is D_L=L/C. If the message symbols are in M-ary alphabet and the downloaded symbols are in M'-ary alphabet, then we show that the optimal download cost in M'-ary symbols, D_L∈{L'/C,L'/C- 1,L'/C- 2 }, where L'= L _M' M...|$|R

50|$|The Xbox 360 {{controller}} has a guide {{button in}} the center of its face that provides a new functionality. This button is surrounded by a ring of lights divided into four quadrants that provide gamers with different types of information during game play. For instance, during a split screen multiplayer match, a particular quadrant will light up to indicate to a player which part of the screen he or she is playing on at that time. In this case, when the user pushes the button, he or she accesses the Xbox guide; a menu which provides access to features like <b>messaging</b> friends, <b>downloading</b> content, voice chat and customizing soundtracks, while staying in the game. The Guide button also allows users to turn off the controller or the console by holding the button for a few seconds (rather than simply pressing it).|$|R
50|$|A user's mailbox can be {{accessed}} in two dedicated ways. The Post Office Protocol (POP) allows the user to <b>download</b> <b>messages</b> {{one at a time}} and only deletes them from the server after they have been successfully saved on local storage. It is possible to leave messages on the server to permit another client to access them. However, there is no provision for flagging a specific message as seen, answered, or forwarded, thus POP is not convenient for users who access the same mail from different machines.|$|R

The Mail Dispatcher feature shows subject and sender information for messages, and {{allows users to}} avoid downloading blatant spam by selecting which <b>messages</b> to <b>download.</b> The filter self-trains by analyzing incoming and outgoing e-mail not marked as spam, or by analyzing folders only containing spam or valid e-mail. Senders of verified valid e-mail are whitelisted. E-mail can also be whitelisted or blacklisted based on phrases present in the text. E-mail with non-ASCII characters or invisible text can also be blocked. However, version 7.0 had a relatively poor showing, misidentifying 30 percent of valid messages in PC Magazine testing. 30 percent of spam also made to the inbox.|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the design and {{realisation}} of system for automatic evaluation of e-mail messages. The system works with PHP language and MySQL database. It also allows automatic synchronisation. During the synchronisation e-mail <b>messages</b> are <b>downloaded</b> and saved using IMAP or POP 3 protocol. Subsequently, the messages are analysed. During the analysis the reports are classified into types, according to pre-defined keywords. The system also works with black lists and white lists. If the sender of an e-mail is during the synchronisation found in the blacklist, that e-mail will be skipped. On the contrary, if the sender of an e-mail is found within the white list, that e-mail will be excluded from keyword matching and from the list is type and category loaded. Most of the values from the carried out evaluation of the e-mails can be clearly seen in advanced statistics. Pie charts and numerical statistics are available. Access to the system is protected by a login. Therefore, login can only registered users...|$|R

40|$|A delay-tolerant {{network is}} a mobile ad hoc network where the message {{dissemination}} {{is based on}} the store-carry-andforward principle. This principle raises new aspects of the privacy problem. In particular, an attacker can build a user profile and trace the nodes based on this profile even if the message exchange protocol provides anonymity. In this paper, an attacker model is presented and some proposed attackers are implemented. We analyze the efficiency of both the attacks and the proposed defense mechanism, called Hide-and-Lie Strategy. We show that without any defense mechanism, the nodes are traceable, but with the Hide-and-Lie Strategy, the success probability of an attacker can be made equal to the success probability of the simple guessing. Furthermore, in some scenarios, the Hide-and-Lie Strategy increases the message delivery ratio. The number of <b>downloaded</b> <b>messages</b> and the maximal memory size required to apply the proposed privacy defense mechanism is also investigated...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the use of the}} Quick Response codes (QR codes) as a way to engage students in an interactive scavenger hunt to review course content prior to an exam. QR codes (quick response codes) are two-dimensional, camera-readable bar codes that have become popular for allowing smartphones and other camera-equipped, web-connected devices access to web sites, text <b>messages,</b> and application <b>downloads.</b> QR codes are read by a mobile device through the device’s camera using an application specifically designed to read the information embedded in the code. QR codes are easily recognizable by their square shape and series of black square/white space patterns. The size of the QR code is largely irrelevant: as long as the device’s camera can bring the code into the field of view, the code can be read by the code reader application.

40|$|Peer-to-peer (p 2 p) {{systems such}} as Gnutella and KaZaa are {{routinely}} used by millions of people for sharing music and many other files over the Internet, and they account for {{a significant portion of}} the Internet traffic. The p 2 p traffic can be broken down into two categories: protocol messages for maintaining and searching the overlay p 2 p network, and data <b>messages</b> for <b>downloading</b> data files. This paper makes the following two contributions. First, we present a study of the locality in the collective Gnutella query protocol messages being initiated and forwarded by servents within the same organization. Second, we propose a transparent query caching scheme to reduce the bandwidth consumed by p 2 p traffic going in and out of the gateway of an organization. Our locality measurements show that there is significant locality in the collective queries going through a gateway forwarded by servents behind that gateway, and the locality increases with the population of those servents. Our proposed transparent caching scheme preserves the user experience, i. e., users continue to use the same servents as before, and queries will result in similar query hits with or without the caching running. Measurements of our transparent caching proxy in an experimental testbed of eight passive Gnutella servents in a LAN has shown a query cache hit rate of up to 38 %, an uplink query traffic reduction of up to 40 %, and a downlink query hit traffic reduction of up to 12 % at the gateway. ...|$|R
