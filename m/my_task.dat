The concern that my art was misused for propaganda had to yield to the greater concern that German music be preserved, that music {{be given to the}} German people by its own musicians. These people, the compatriots of Bach and Beethoven, of Mozart and Schubert, still had to go on living under the control of a regime obsessed with total war.

500|$|Howarth {{said he had}} {{no desire}} to portray a {{redeemed}} Todd, and that the show would be better off finding [...] "a Todd who won't object to the material." [...] He subsequently left the series for a year. In the October 24, 1995 Soap Opera Digest issue, he stated:In the beginning, the character of Todd was successful. I'll always be proud of this story, because it {{was the result of a}} real team effort. It was one of those spectacular times when the writer, producer, director, grips, engineers and actors were all on the same wavelength. Everybody was working toward a common goal. <b>My</b> <b>task,</b> at the time, was to show the humanity of someone who was basically inhuman. Todd wasn't one-dimensional, but he was definitely a serious psychopath. Todd was a serial rapist. He raped Carol Swift. Then, he raped Marty Saybrooke, and that rape was brutal, intense, violent and realistic. There were innuendos he had raped other women before. He stalked Nora, he stalked and tried to rape Luna. [...] Linda Gottlieb told me with reasonable certainty that [...] would not try to redeem Todd. So, I didn't think the character would change. Then about a year ago, it became clear to me they were taking the character on a different path—they were redeeming him. In my mind, I'd been hired to play Todd Manning, a very realistic, serious psychopath. But now, the powers-that-be wanted me to play Todd Lord. And the story of Todd Lord is not realistic—it's a fairy tale. I thought, [...] "It would be best for the show if I were to leave." [...] That's when I tendered my resignation.|$|E

2500|$|Canada's first francophone prime minister, Laurier {{is often}} {{considered}} one of the country's greatest statesmen. He is well known for his policies of conciliation, expanding Confederation, and compromise between French and English Canada. His vision for Canada was a land of individual liberty and decentralized federalism. [...] He also argued for an English-French partnership in Canada. [...] "I have had before me as a pillar of fire," [...] he said, [...] "a policy of true Canadianism, of moderation, of [...]" [...] He passionately defended individual liberty, [...] "Canada is free and freedom is its nationality," [...] and [...] "Nothing will prevent me from continuing <b>my</b> <b>task</b> of preserving at all cost our civil liberty." [...] Laurier was also well-regarded for his efforts to establish Canada as an autonomous country within the British Empire, and he supported the continuation of the Empire if it was based on [...] "absolute liberty political and commercial". A 2011 Maclean's historical ranking of the Prime Ministers placed Laurier first.|$|E

2500|$|Billie Whitelaw {{worked with}} Beckett for 25 years on such plays as Not I, Eh Joe, Krapp's Last Tape, and Footfalls and Rockaby. She first met Beckett in 1963. In her {{autobiography}} she describes {{their first meeting}} in 1963 was [...] "trust at first sight". Beckett went on to write many of his experimental theatre works for her. She came {{to be regarded as}} his muse, the [...] "supreme interpreter of his work", perhaps most famous for her role as the mouth in Not I. She said of the play Rockaby: [...] "I put the tape in my head. And I sort of look in a particular way, but not at the audience. Sometimes as a director Beckett comes out with absolute gems and I use them a lot in other areas. We were doing Happy Days and I just did not know where in the theatre to look during this particular section. And I asked, and he thought for a bit and then said, 'Inward' [...] ". She said of her role in Footfalls: [...] "I felt like a moving, musical Edvard Munch painting and, in fact, when Beckett was directing Footfalls he was not only using me to play the notes but I almost felt that he did have the paintbrush out and was painting." [...] "Sam knew that I would turn myself inside out to give him what he wanted", she explained. [...] "With all of Sam's work, the scream was there, <b>my</b> <b>task</b> was to try to get it out." [...] She stopped performing his plays in 1989 when he died.|$|E
