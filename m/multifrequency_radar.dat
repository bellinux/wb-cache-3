30|$|In {{previous}} works [8, 9], we studied the resolution attainable by a <b>multifrequency</b> and multistatic <b>radar</b> using analytical and numerical approaches. Results showed that <b>multifrequency</b> and multistatic <b>radars</b> could achieve sufficient resolution using several narrowband transmitters {{and a long}} integration time. In this paper, we propose imaging algorithms for <b>multifrequency</b> and multistatic <b>radars,</b> which could be useful as a preprocessing for classification methods. Most of imaging algorithms {{are based on the}} Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) concept [10]. The main purpose of imaging algorithms is to achieve enough resolution to make the classification step easy. For instance, the final images corresponding to two similar targets must exhibit enough differences so {{that it is possible to}} make the difference. For narrowband radar, it is well known that data from transmitter-receiver pairs distributed all around the target allow to have an image [11, 12] with such properties. These particular systems are similar to tomographic ones. Recently, Wu and Munson [13] simulated the imaging of a moving airplane using a multistatic radar composed of several TV transmitters and a single receiver. The imaging algorithm in [13] relies on the assumption that the target is composed of isotropic points and uses 2 D interpolation on the frequency domain to achieve the processing. However, the resulting images are subject to degradation because the target has to be illuminated over a long period (in this case, the target is often nonstationary). Several methods have been proposed for solving this problem: time-frequency-based methods [14 – 16], deconvolution methods [17], or optimization techniques [18].|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{increase}} in maritime traffic, particularly {{the transport of}} hazardous and noxious substances (HNSs), requires advanced methods of identification and characterization in environmental chemical spills. Knowledge about HNS monitoring using radar remote sensing is not as extensive as for oil spills; however, any progress on this issue would likely advance the monitoring of both chemical and oil-related incidents. To address the need for HNS monitoring, an experiment was conducted in May 2015 over the Mediterranean Sea during which controlled releases of HNS were imaged by a <b>multifrequency</b> <b>radar</b> system. The aim of this experiment was to establish a procedure for collecting evidence of illegal maritime pollution by noxious liquid substances using airborne radar sensors. In this paper, we demonstrate the ability of radar imagery to detect and characterize chemicals at sea. A normalized polarization difference parameter is introduced to quantify both the impacts of released product on the ocean surface and the relative concentration of the substance within the spill. We show that radar imagery can provide knowledge of the involved HNS.

A correlation between the roughness parameters has been also supposed in the simulation as a priori information, to evaluate its effect on the estimation accuracy. The methods have been tested on simulated data to compare their performances as function of number of looks, incidence angles and frequency bands, thus identifying the best radar configuration in terms of estimation accuracy.

40|$|NASA has {{teamed with}} the FAA, DoD, industry, and academia for {{research}} into the remote detection and measurement of atmospheric conditions leading to aircraft icing hazards. The ultimate goal of this effort is to provide pilots, controllers, and dispatchers sufficient information to allow aircraft to avoid or minimize their exposure to the hazards of in-flight icing. Since the hazard of in-flight icing is the outcome of aircraft flight through clouds containing supercooled liquid water and strongly influenced by the aircraft s speed and configuration and by the length of exposure, the hazard cannot be directly detected, but must be inferred based upon the measurement of conducive atmospheric conditions. Therefore, icing hazard detection is accomplished through the detection and measurement of liquid water in regions of measured sub-freezing air temperatures. The icing environment is currently remotely measured from {{the ground with a}} system fusing radar, lidar, and multifrequency microwave radiometer sensors. Based upon expected ice accretion severity for the measured environment, a resultant aircraft hazard is then calculated.

Two current airborne concepts are based upon the use of either multifrequency radiometers or <b>multifrequency</b> <b>radar.</b> Both ground-based and airborne solutions are required for the future since groundbased systems can provide hazard detection for all aircraft in airport terminal regions while airborne systems will be needed to provide equipped aircraft with flight path coverage between terminal regions...|$|E

At {{the time of the}} AIRSAR overflight, ground teams recorded the snow and firn (old snow) stratigraphy, grain size, density, and temperature at ice camps in three of the four snow zones identified by glaciologists to characterize four different degrees of summer melting of the Greenland ice sheet. The four snow zones are: (1) the dry-snow zone, at high elevation, where melting rarely occurs; (2) the percolation zone, where summer melting generates water that percolates down through the cold, porous, dry snow and then refreezes in place to form massive layers and pipes of solid ice; (3) the soaked-snow zone where melting saturates the snow with liquid water and forms standing lakes; and (4) the ablation zone, at the lowest elevations, where melting is vigorous enough to remove the seasonal snow cover and ablate the glacier ice. There is interest in mapping the spatial extent and temporal variability of these different snow zones repeatedly by using remote sensing techniques. The objectives of the 1991 experiment were to study changes in radar scattering properties across the different melting zones of the Greenland ice sheet, and relate the radar properties of the ice sheet to the snow and firn physical properties via relevant scattering mechanisms.

The adaptive OFDM signal yields a better auto-correlation function (ACF) that results into an improved delay (range) resolution for the radar system. First, we develop a mutlicarrier OFDM signal model and the corresponding WAF at {{the output of the}} matched filter, emphasizing that the received signal depends on the scattering parameters of the target. Then, we devise an optimization procedure to select the OFDM waveform such that the volume of the corresponding WAF best approximates the volume of a desired ambiguity function. We demonstrate the improvement in the resulting ambiguity function, along with the associated ACF, through numerical examples. We find that the optimization algorithm puts more signal energy at subcarriers in which the target response is weaker.
