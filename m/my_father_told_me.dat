25|$|When I was a kid, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{about an}} {{accident}} that happened while {{he was working on}} Grand Coulee Dam in Washington. (At the time, Grand Coulee Dam was the world’s largest dam.) One day, a crane operator failed to see him, swung a quarter-ton bucket of wet concrete into his side, and knocked him off the dam. He managed to reach around in midair, grabbed the bottom rim of the bucket, swung out with it, and when it came back in dropped into the middle of a patch of fresh concrete.|$|E
500|$|Ali Mansour Ahmed Khudair was a 53 or 58-year-old Bahraini {{who died}} on 17February after police shot at his back. He had 91 pellets in his chest. Khudair was a {{fisherman}} from Sitra {{who lived in a}} ramshackle house. He had three sons: Hassan (21), Jaffar (14) and Ahmed (9), as well as an 18-year-old daughter. Jaffar said: [...] "I was with my father in Pearl Roundabout when they attacked. We were asleep at first, when I woke up, I started moving away, but <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to endure, stay and not fear. Then we heard screams and rushed there. For a few seconds he spoke to the security forces, asking them to stay away from women and children, but they shot him in the chest. He fell to the ground and I couldn't see him after tear gas cloud covered the place." ...|$|E
2500|$|Trivedi {{has filed}} many petitions. He says, [...] "I was so fed up of {{corruption}} then. I thought I can't progress here. But, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{to learn to}} fight corruption, make your way." [...] Trivedi shot into prominence when he asked the Supreme Court to make the Vohra report on the criminalization of politics in India public. This petition gave a push to the Right to Information movement.|$|E
6000|$|... "You know," [...] {{said the}} girl, [...] "the {{surest way to}} make people find out the worst is to keep them ignorant. <b>My</b> <b>father's</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> it was a quarrel about property. But I don't believe it; we've both got heaps. They wouldn't have been so bourgeois as all that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he answered, [...] "no one. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> only <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{that the}} name of the little village is Kleindorf. He wrote it on the label for my bag." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>father,</b> Jessie <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> was now {{cultivating}} {{more than}} five hundred acres of land, and deeply worried, for his wheat was thin and light and the price less than sixty cents per bushel.|$|R
60|$|After a {{considerable}} silence <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{how he had}} met Marx abroad. He had done him some service and they had become friendly. He latterly engaged him as secretary.|$|E
6000|$|... "I came," [...] {{she said}} softly, [...] "because {{it was the}} only atonement I could make. I ought to have trusted you. Do you know, even <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I {{must have}} dreamt it," [...] said Alton gravely. [...] "Or perhaps <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> He {{used to talk}} of Carnaby, and I feel I know it well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I do, {{and what}} is more, I intend, sooner or later, {{to try to have}} matters mended. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> always <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he wished me to keep on going to school and then to enter Princeton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} {{to have heard}} something of this from <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> who <b>told</b> <b>me</b> at the same time, that the reason why you left your people was to your credit. But you had music in the thicket?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And as, perhaps, I {{seemed to}} wonder at {{this way of}} beginning, he opened a little, and said, [...] "It is <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that if ever I came here I was to mind and do his work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{only knew}} what <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> an d what all our friends believed--that {{she had a}} tumor in the neck, or, as I {{sometimes}} heard it stated, from the effect on her constitution of a tumor in the neck." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was not all," [...] {{said the}} girl; [...] "it was Lord Tyrrell's {{coming in the}} way. Yes, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so; he {{held it up to}} me as an example of what one ought to do for one's family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are such}} jealous creatures," [...] she explained; [...] "they always follow me about, and fly at every dog that comes near me. Poor dog! {{that is the}} one, I suppose, who killed Snarleyow. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'From what <b>my</b> <b>father</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of him, he is not--a more {{desirable}} brother-in-law {{to me than}} I shall be in all likelihood to him. What business has a man of that character to marry Berta, I should like to ask?' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It really cost us a lot. I'm {{talking about}} losing {{furniture}} in the house, having it repossessed {{and things of that}} nature. It was a very terrible period for our family. And <b>my</b> <b>father</b> once <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that if he had had good legal help this wouldn't have happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All you're goin' to say," [...] said Disko. [...] "All {{dead wrong}} {{from start to}} finish, an' Whittier he's to blame. I have no special call to right any Marblehead man, but 'tweren't no fault o' Ireson's. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> the tale time an' again, an' {{this is the way}} 'twuz." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, I {{should never}} have thought of such a thing, Mr. Prendergast, {{if it had not}} been for what <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> that my uncle was desperately in earnest about it, and had an intense {{conviction}} that someone watched his every movement." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Father John, av {{you could}} feel all I felt when I first knew the man was dead--when my own sisther spurned me--and when <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I was a murdherer, you wouldn't wonder at my flying, av it were only for an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Grace, [...] "I {{suppose it}} cost you {{an effort to}} be firm and I hope it did. You needn't be afraid, though. When <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> I understood, and it won't hurt to leave Tarnside; I'm anxious to get away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is wonderful," [...] she said, [...] "but I {{have often}} heard that name. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how {{a little boy}} called Allan Quatermain once saved my life by putting out my dress when it was on fire--see!"--and {{she pointed to a}} faint red mark upon her neck--"here is the scar of the burn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> should have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to leave the room," [...] said Marian. [...] "It was Sholto's place to have gone, not mine." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>father,</b> I say, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that he {{was more}} pestered with the clamours of these people than of those who were truly refugees, and fled in {{distress}} merely for conscience.|$|R
60|$|LORD GORING. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{to go to}} bed an hour ago. I don’t see why I shouldn’t {{give you}} the same advice. I always pass on good advice. It is the only thing to do with it. It is never of any use to oneself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Zoola," [...] {{answered}} Noie, shuddering, [...] "for it is true. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of it, and of {{what happened}} once to some wild men who broke into the sanctuary, and shot arrows at the Tree. No, no, I will not tell the story; it is dreadful." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{going through}} this encampment it seemed that already had we of the colonies {{gathered}} a vast army, yet <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> there were less than five thousand men then in Cambridge; but promised {{that they would be}} speedily increased in numbers as the days went by.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes!' {{she said}} quickly; 'she {{believed}} there were excellent beds at the coffee-house.' He {{noticed that the}} coffee-house was quite a majestic hotel to her, and that she treasured its reputation. 'I believe it is very expensive,' said Little Dorrit, 'but <b>MY</b> <b>father</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that quite beautiful dinners may be got there. And wine,' she added timidly. 'Were you ever there?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{several times}} how useful {{you were to}} him in washing out his {{apparatus}} and cleaning his crucibles and getting his fires going in readiness. He wonders now how he got on so long without a helper, and will be sorry {{when the time comes}} for you to go with me. Indeed he said, but two days ago, that when you went he should certainly look for someone to fill your place." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>father</b> {{has often}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that he revises his {{writings}} on religious subjects. I may harmlessly imitate that good example, by revising my restored entry. It {{is now a}} sufficiently remarkable performance to be distinguished by a title. Let me call it: ...|$|R
60|$|It may be {{well that}} I should put a short preface to this book. In {{the summer of}} 1878 <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that he had written a memoir of his own life. He did not speak about it at length, but {{said that he had}} written me a letter, not to be opened until after his death, {{containing}} instructions for publication.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Hetty. [...] "I'm {{sorry he}} didn't. I have a letter for the Sheriff to give him, {{and wanted to}} get rid of the thing. It is important, and I fancy, from what <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> if any of the homestead-boys got it they could make trouble for us. Chris is to ride in with it and hand it to the Sheriff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I stood entranced," [...] {{continued}} the burglar, [...] "gazing upon this babe, for I was {{very fond of}} children; but I remembered that I must not waste time, and stepped softly into the next room. There I beheld Mr. and Mrs. Williamson Green in bed, both fast asleep, the gentleman breathing a little hard. In a corner, just where <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I should find it, stood the box upon the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is what <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{has just}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of as what may happen, {{and he never}} talks nonsense," [...] said Mary, looking up at Fred now, while he grasped her hand as they walked, till it rather hurt her; {{but she would not}} complain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so, <b>my</b> lord; <b>my</b> <b>father</b> but now <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that hawks, {{far less}} eagles, pair {{not with the}} humble linnet. Seek some court lady, to whom your favours will be honour; to me--your Highness must permit me to speak the plain truth--they can be nothing but disgrace." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That may be so, Beorn. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that {{he could}} {{remember}} when our estates stretched a good half-mile farther seaward, but had since been eaten away by the waves, {{and he says that}} his <b>father</b> had <b>told</b> him the same thing; therefore, as you say, in many hundreds of years even hills, if the stone were soft, might also be worn away. There we are rounding the point, and beyond there are no more cliffs; doubtless it is in this bay that the Shipmaster Edred thinks to anchor." ...|$|R
