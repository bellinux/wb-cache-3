Let us look on hopefully to the future; let us {{not look}} back too much at the past, or rake up old follies which have been pardoned and done away. But let us thank God whenever he thinks fit to shew us the past, and bring our sin to our remembrance. Let us thank him, when meeting an old acquaintance, passing by an old haunt, looking over an old letter, reminds us what fools we were ten, twenty, thirty years ago. Let us thank him for those nightly dreams, in which old tempers, old meannesses, old sins, rise up again in us into ugly life, and frighten us by <b>making</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> our sleep, what we were once, God forgive us! when broad awake. I am not superstitious. I know that those dreams are bred merely of our brain and of our blood. But I {{know that they are}} none the less messages from God. They tell us unmistakeably that we are the same persons that we were twenty years ago. They tell us that there is the same infection of nature, the same capability of sin, in us, that there was of old. That in our flesh dwells no good thing: that by the grace of God alone we are what we are: and that did his grace leave us, we might be once more as utter fools as we were in the wild days of youth. Yes: let us thank God for everything which reminds us of what we once were. Let us humble ourselves before him whenever those memories return to us; and let us learn from them what St. Paul learnt. To be charitable to all who have not yet learnt the wisdom which God (as we may trust) has taught to us; to feel for them, feel with them, be sure that they are our brothers, men of like passions with ourselves, who will be tried by the same standard as we; whom therefore we must not judge, lest we be judged in turn: and let us have, as St. Paul had, hope for them all; hope that God who has forgiven us, will forgive them; that God who has raised us from the death of sin, to something of the life of righteousness, will raise them up likewise, in his own good time.|$|E

40|$|This piece, {{translated}} into many languages, and, {{the last section}} of which (a fable between a frog and nightgown, an eye and a shoe) is being animated into video, chronicles the rage, horror, depression, courage of all those infected and/or affected by the HIV-Aids pandemic. Like many of her generation [...] and before anti-virals were discovered [...] Golding lost over 50 + beloved wild and beautiful lovers, friends and comrades to this ugly disease, though {{at the time of}} writing, the 'number' was recorded at slightly less (40); each one precious, real, searing. The curious aspect of the piece was in its immediate aftermath of publication. For many it seemed 'odd' that HIV-Aids might affect anyone who was not 'gay-male'; so that when Golding herself went to seek grief counseling over this mad, traumatic, relentless tsunami of grief, the doctors told her that she should go read this 'really important piece written by a woman!' "But I AM the woman who wrote that piece!!". Abstract from the published version: "This is an angry, melancholic piece about death and dying and carrying on. It laces together the rawness of those 'problems' with the vitality and courage that all of us have had to muster in order to begin again, always and forever again, whether this 'us' be packaged as dyke or fag or tranny or queen or bisexual or queer or anything else yet to be invented. The people and their situations recorded are personal and particular; the deaths diverse and painful; yet their lives resonate at the more universal - dare we say 'political' - level. At the risk of saying both too much and too little, what has become clear for all of us who are a part of THIS community, this glorious gay community (stuffed to its multiple gills with frivolity, mutation and decay), is that our 'beginnings' create the very surface of an adult version - not to put too fine a point on it, of childhood itself. But this is an odd, often cruel form of childhood - one that skates upon the carnal knowledge of sex and sweat, encapsulated at the boundaries of our skin. We are the adult-children who refuse to give up our friendships and our loves {{in the face of this}} damnable brutality. We are the horror-children, the exiles, the journeyers, with the wrong outfits, the wrong loves, wrong jokes, wrong sicknesses, wrong deaths, carrying on, despite all odds. A bravado etched across always-already-beginning beginnings, <b>making</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> one word: pariah. ...|$|E
