500|$|Maurice Richardson, in The Observer, thought You Only Live Twice [...] "though {{far from}} the best Bond, is really almost as easy to read as any of them". He was {{critical}} {{of a number of}} aspects, saying that the [...] "narrative is a bit weak, action long delayed and disappointing when it comes but the surround of local colour... has been worked over with that unique combination of pubescent imagination and industry which is Mr. Fleming's speciality." [...] In The Guardian, Francis Iles wrote that [...] "I think he [...] <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> tired of the ineffable James Bond and perhaps even of writing thrillers at all". Iles reasoned that [...] "of the 260 pages of You Only Live Twice...only 60 are concerned with the actual business of a thriller", and his enjoyment was further diminished by what he considered [...] "the grossness of Bond's manners and his schoolboy obscenities".|$|E

Schade (in [...] "the Burning Plain and Other Stories) ,since the Spanish {{refers to a}} father's anger with his son for not having helped him hear the dogs, which were, indeed, barking." [...] The story opens with a father’s request that his son Ignacio tell him if he can’t hear anything or see any lights in the distance: “You up there, Ignacio! Don’t you hear something or see a light somewhere?” Ignacio responds that he does not, and the father says that they <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> close" [...] about a man carrying his estranged, adult, wounded son on his back to find a doctor.

2500|$|Upon its release, No Mercy {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 59, based on 15 reviews, which indicates [...] "mixed or average reviews". Henry Adaso of About.com states [...] "Arguably T.I.'s worst outing yet, No Mercy relies on gruesomely listless party tunes {{and the occasional}} whining" [...] and stating [...] "The production on No Mercy is painfully generic for a rapper once known for rocking {{some of the best}} beats money can buy". AllMusic writer Andy Kellman described it as [...] "a career low point for all involved" [...] however he states [...] "There's a sense that he'll regain focus once his legal matters settle". Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club states [...] "As is the case with 2Pac, it's difficult to separate the ongoing crime drama/soap opera of T.I.'s life from the music he creates. So {{it should come as no}} surprise that No Mercy, the superstar's latest post-and-pre-prison-stint album, reflects the life lessons and soul-searching that come with extended jail time at the height of a superstar's fame". Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe noted that [...] "throughout this disc there's an unsettling celebration of the untamed life without any reflection on the consequences T.I. often laments". Entertainment Weeklys Brad Wete noted that [...] "The self-proclaimed King of the South addresses his troubles on several tracks while on others he remains unrepentant, though: On Get Back Up, he arrogantly apologizes for being human rather than for his crimes" [...] Wete ended the review by stating [...] "That crown <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> heavy".|$|E
