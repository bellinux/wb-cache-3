25|$|Dublin Zoo {{holds the}} European {{studbook}} for <b>Moluccan</b> <b>cockatoos.</b> A studbook {{is a record}} of all the individuals of a particular species that are held in zoos in a region. It contains information such as {{the sex of the}} animal, how old it is and who its parents were. This information is then used to decide which birds should be paired with which to get the best genetic mix. This ensures that the captive population stays as genetically healthy as possible. <b>Moluccan</b> <b>cockatoos</b> are handsome birds, white-with-a-hint-of-pink feathers and a pink colour on the crest. This cockatoo is on the endangered species list.|$|R

50|$|The red-vented {{cockatoo}} makes a characteristic bleating call, {{as well as}} screeching or whistling noises that are common to most cockatoos. It is quieter than most cockatoos, and much quieter than the umbrella cockatoo or <b>Moluccan</b> <b>cockatoo.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the wild}} the salmon-crested {{cockatoo}} inhabits lowland forests below 1000 m. The diet consists mainly of seeds, nuts and fruit, {{as well as}} coconuts. There is additional evidence that they eat insects off the ground, and pet <b>Moluccan</b> <b>cockatoos</b> have tested positive for anemia if their diet does not include enough protein.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} two fatal cases of Salmonella Typhimurium phage type DT 160 {{infection}} in <b>Moluccan</b> <b>cockatoos</b> (Cacatua moluccensis) from a zoological collection in Italy. No previous clinical signs {{were observed in}} birds before death, except for anorexia and mild diarrhea in one bird. At post mortem, necrotic foci surrounded by a hyperemic halo were observed in lungs, heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, and intestine. Microscopically, heterophils and macrophages with rare lymphocyte infiltration associated with gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria aggregates were detected in necrotic foci. Bacteriology confirmed the presence of Salmonella Typhimurium phage type DT 160 in the tissues of birds. The source of Salmonella Typhimurium in these birds remains unknown, but the authors emphasize the need to better control Salmonella infections in these avian species because they are important zoonotic agents and responsible for disease in animals and humans. This is the first documentation of Salmonella Typhimurium phage type DT 160 infection in <b>Moluccan</b> <b>cockatoos...</b>|$|R
50|$|The salmon-crested {{cockatoo}} {{can no longer}} be imported into the United States because it is listed on the Wild Bird Conservation Act. However, they are being bred in captivity. They are popular for their beauty and trainability (which makes them popular in trained bird shows).The {{salmon-crested cockatoo}} is widely considered {{to be one of the}} most demanding parrots to keep as a pet due to their high intelligence, large size, potential noise level, and need to chew. <b>Moluccan</b> <b>cockatoos</b> require a very large and very sturdy cage or aviary. Salmon-crested cockatoos are highly social and pets can be extremely cuddly, affectionate, and gentle birds. This can lead to problems if a young cockatoo is spoiled with a great deal of attention and cuddling when young and does not get the opportunity to learn to play with toys, forage, or otherwise entertain itself.Salmon-crested cockatoos require a great deal of attention and activity to remain healthy and well-adjusted. Attention and training from human caregivers is important in keeping them occupied, as are chewable toys and foraging toys that require them to work for their food. As with most large cockatoos, the salmon-crested cockatoo may develop health and behavioral problems such as feather-plucking and aggression if not provided with the appropriate environment, attention, and enrichment opportunities.|$|R

50|$|Cacatua is a genus of {{cockatoos}} found {{from the}} Philippines and Wallacea {{east to the}} Solomon Islands and south to Australia. They have a primarily white plumage (in some species tinged pinkish or yellow), an expressive crest, and a black (subgenus Cacatua) or pale (subgenus Licmetis) bill. Today several species from this genus are considered threatened due {{to a combination of}} habitat loss and capture for the wild bird trade, with the blue-eyed cockatoo, <b>Moluccan</b> <b>cockatoo</b> and umbrella cockatoo considered Vulnerable, and the red-vented cockatoo and yellow-crested cockatoo considered Critically Endangered.|$|E

U.S. ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith, for instance, appeared on the 15 November 1994 episode to promote a Christmas card competition. President Mary McAleese appeared on the programme on the 19 December 1997 episode, while the Australian didgeridoo player Rolf Harris was a guest on the 13 October 1998 episode.|$|E
5000|$|The Salmon-crested {{cockatoo}} (Cacatua moluccensis) {{also known}} as the <b>Moluccan</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> is a cockatoo endemic to the Seram archipelago in eastern Indonesia. At a height of up to 46-52 cm and weight of up to 850 g, it is among the largest of the white cockatoos. The female is larger than the male on average. It has white-pink feathers with a definite peachy glow, a slight yellow on the underwing and underside of the tail feathers and a large retractable recumbent crest which it raises when threatened, revealing hitherto concealed bright red-orange plumes to frighten potential attackers. It may also be raised in excitement or in other 'emotional' displays. Some describe the crest as [...] "flamingo-colored." [...] It also has one of the louder calls in the parrot world and in captivity is a capable mimic.|$|E
50|$|Hondecoeter {{kept his}} own poultry yard at his house, but visited the country houses of his patrons {{where he could}} study more exotic species. It was {{said that he had}} trained a rooster to stand still on command, so that he could paint it without interruption. In this picture, {{alongside}} the great white pelican are species of wild fowl and domesticated duck, among them a Eurasian teal, common merganser, red-breasted goose, Eurasian wigeon, common shelduck, muscovy duck, brant goose, smew, Egyptian goose, and northern pintail. On {{the far side of the}} pool are also large birds from different continents: a southern cassowary, black crowned crane, and American flamingo. A sarus crane and a second flamingo are visible in the background. Flying above the pool there is a golden oriole depicted.Hondecoeter produced a strikingly similar picture, A Pelican and other exotic birds in a park, in which some elements of the composition are identical: the birds on the water, the group of exotic birds, the pelican, and the floating feather. Other features are similar, such as the landscape and the muscovy duck which is seen in full, while some are entirely different; in this picture a <b>Moluccan</b> <b>cockatoo</b> perches in a tree above the pool and different birds are introduced on the far side of the pool to the right. The exact date of this painting is not known, but it is estimated to be between 1655 and 1660.|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of a coccidian parasite, Cryptosporidium, among {{birds in the}} Kuala Lumpur National Zoo was investigated in this study. A hundred bird fecal samples were taken from various locations of the zoo. Fecal smears prepared using direct smear and formalin ethyl acetate concentration technique were stained with modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain. Samples positive for Cryptosporidium with Ziehl-Neelsen stain were later confirmed using the immunofluorescence technique and viewed under the epifluorescence microscope. Six species of bird feces were confirmed positive with Cryptosporidium oocysts. They included Wrinkled Hornbill (Aceros corrugatus), Great Argus Pheasant (Argusianus argus), Black Swan (Cygnus atratus), Swan Goose (Anser cygnoides), Marabou Stork (Leptoptilos crumeniferus), and <b>Moluccan</b> <b>Cockatoo</b> (Cacatua moluccencis). These birds were located in the aviary and lake, with the <b>Moluccan</b> <b>Cockatoo</b> routinely used as a show bird. Results obtained in this study indicated that animal sanctuaries like zoos and bird parks are important sources of Cryptosporidium infection to humans, especially children and other animals...|$|E
40|$|Abbie, {{an adult}} <b>Moluccan</b> <b>Cockatoo,</b> {{presented}} to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals on July 2, 2007 with a two week history of voice change, a one week history of audible wheezing, and a two day history of anorexia. One week prior to presentation, the patient {{was brought to the}} referring veterinarian and was treated for presumptive aspergillosis. At the time of presentation to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals, the available laboratory results demonstrated an unremarkable complete blood count (CBC) and chemistry panel, and negative chlamydial titers (< 10). Upon presentation to Cornell, Abbie was quiet, alert, and responsive. Abbie was dyspneic, open mouth breathing, with pronounced audible wheezing. After oxygen cage stabilization, the patient was placed under general anesthesia and blood was drawn revealing a mild heterophilia, lymphopenia, monocytosis and mild anemia. Radiographic findings were highly suggestive of a tracheal mass. Tracheal endoscopy was performed, demonstrating a white mass occluding most of the trachea {{at the level of the}} syrinx. Approximately 80 - 90 % of the mass was debulked. The aerobic culture from the mass did not yield any organisms, however in-house cytology demonstrated organisms consistent with Aspergillus. Aspergillosis is the most common fungal respiratory disease of birds and is caused by Aspergillus, a ubiquitous soil saprophyte. Transmission occurs most commonly when airborne spores are inhaled. Immunosuppression or exposure to a vast numbers of spores predisposes birds to this disease. This presentation provides an introduction to the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of avian aspergillosis in the context of Abbie's case...|$|E
