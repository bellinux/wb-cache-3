40|$|Citriculture {{normally}} uses high application volumes in pesticide solutions (of 2. 000 to 5. 000 L ha(- 1)) {{to control}} pests and diseases {{that affect the}} crop, which generates an increase in operational costs. For this reason, diverse systems of application are being developed to reduce application volumes and improve the uniformity of pesticide deposition. The goal of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of two application systems of pesticides in citrus trees. One system used a prototype for terrestrial application <b>with</b> <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> atomizers that are widely used in agricultural aviation, and the other system used hollow cone tip hydraulics. For {{the treatment of the}} trees the insecticide Metidation was used at the dose of 180 gr per hectare. To study the droplet spectrum, water-sensitive papers were installed at different positions in the trees canopy, and for the study of insecticide deposition leaves of the treated plants were collected. The water-sensitive papers were collected and analyzed using a computerized image analysis system (e-Sprinkle, EMBRAPA, Sao Paulo, Brazil), and the leaves analyzed by the technique of gas chromatography. Pesticide deposition was similar in both application system, although the solution volume used by the application system equipped <b>with</b> <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> atomizers was one quarter of the volume used by the application system equipped with hydraulic tips, reducing considerably the cost of the phytosanitary treatments...|$|R

Local farm practice was followed in cutting, raking and drying. Statistical analysis showed significant treatment differences in both summer and winter experiments. Mechanical-cum-chemical conditioning treatment provided the greatest field drying rate, followed by chemical conditioning alone, mechanical conditioning alone and non-conditioned lucerne, respectively. The effectiveness of mechanical and chemical conditioning treatments was greater in summer than in winter. Under good S. E. Queensland summer conditions, mechanical-cum-chemical conditioning would allow hay to be cut and baled on the same day, but at least 4 days were required under cool winter weather conditions...|$|R
40|$|Battery-powered {{autonomous}} mowers {{are designed}} to reduce the need of labor for lawn mowing compared with traditional endothermic engine mowers {{and at the same}} time to abate local emissions and noise. The aim of this research was to compare autonomous <b>mower</b> <b>with</b> traditional <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> on a tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) lawn under different nitrogen (N) rates. A two-way factor experimental design with three replications was adopted. In the study, fourNrates (0, 50, 100, and 150 kghaL 1) and two mowing systems (autonomous mower vs. gasolinepowered walk-behind rotary mower equipped for mulching) were used. As expected, N fertilization increased turf quality. At the end of the trial, the autonomous mower increased turf density (3. 2 shoots/cm 2) compared <b>with</b> the <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> (2. 1 shoots/cm 2) and decreased average leaf width (2. 1 mm) compared <b>with</b> the <b>rotary</b> <b>mower</b> (2. 7 mm).

40|$|Cotton turf and hotwire {{measurements}} {{were used to}} experimentally assess the highly swirling flow characteristics in a spray dryer fitted <b>with</b> a <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> atomizer. The numerical simulation captured key features of the flow field. Analysis revealed that rapid rotation of an atomizing disc tends to centrifugally split the central inlet jet. The flow field exhibited significant long time-scale transient behaviour. However, this centrifugally split jet resulted in a balanced upward recirculation region in the chamber as expected by the jet-feedback mechanism. Detailed analysis using a 'transient air-steady particle' approach revealed that this approach is applicable for such highly swirling transient flows as well. However, caution should be exercised when interpreting the deposition results, particularly in regions of low particle velocities. This is anticipated be an important consideration in future attempts to simulate the predominantly transient flows in spray dryers. (C) 2011 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

40|$|M. Sc. The work {{is based}} on a project done by SAMES (South African Micro Electronic Systems) for the local {{production}} of an integrated circuit that previously had to be imported. The circuit finds application in the telecommunications field where it controls loop disconnect dialling in the telephones.

40|$|A dual-purpose disc {{agrochemical}} applicator {{for field}} crops {{was developed to}} boost agricultural mechanization in crop production and also to overcome the safety concern of hazardous spray drift during agrochemical application by the field crop farmers. The dual purpose agrochemical applicator was mounted on a high clearance tractor and tested {{with respect to the}} granular fertilizer distribution patterns uniformity/liquid chemical uniformity of droplet sizes in spraying of the agrochemical. Results for NPK granular chemical indicated that, at low (50 kg/ha) and high (150 kg/ha) application rates with 550 rpm disc speed, distribution patterns skewed to the left whereas the distribution pattern at medium (100 kg/ha) application rates was good flattop. Also at high application rate with 1000 rpm disc speed, mean distribution pattern became poor (W-shape). For the liquid chemical herbicide HC 48 amine liquid, the mean values of volume median diameter (VMD) and number median diameter (NMD) were 108 µm and 80 µm at 90 lt/ha application rate at 5000 rpm <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> speed, and also 344 and 222 µm at 30 lt/ha application rate <b>with</b> 2000 rpm <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> speed.

40|$|Insecticides {{application}} {{is the most}} widely used form to control stink bugs in soybean, being the application technology and the insecticide used the major factors for an efficient control. The experiment was conducted in a soybean field during the 2008 / 09 growing season, in São Sepé, RS, in order to evaluate efficiency of three methods of application and two insecticides for controlling stink bugs in soybeans. The experimental design used was completely randomized, in a factorial scheme 3 x 2 + 1 control, with five replicates. The experimental units had dimensions of 40. 0 x 40. 0 m. The factor A was represented by the methods of application, as follows: A 1 - Tractorized spray with hydraulic nozzle; A 2 - Aerial, <b>with</b> <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> atomizers and A 3 - Aerial, with hydraulic nozzles. The factor B was represented by the insecticides, as follows: B 1 - thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin and B 2 -acephate. Ground and aerial applications with low volume oily had greater efficiency for controlling stink bugs in soybean, where led to an increase in soybean grain yield. Insecticides thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin and acephate were similar in controlling stink bugs and in residual effect. A aplicação de inseticidas é a forma mais utilizada no controle de percevejos na cultura da soja, sendo a escolha da tecnologia de aplicação e do inseticida fundamental para obtenção de um controle eficiente. O experimento foi desenvolvido em lavoura comercial de soja, na safra agrícola 2008 / 09, em São Sepé, RS, com o objetivo de avaliar a eficiência de três métodos de aplicação e dois inseticidas no controle de percevejos na soja. O delineamento experimental utilizado foi inteiramente casualizado, em esquema fatorial 3 x 2 + 1 testemunha, com cinco repetições. As unidades experimentais tiveram dimensões de 40, 0 x 40, 0 m. O fator A foi representado pelos métodos de aplicação, sendo: A 1 - Terrestre com pontas hidráulicas, A 2 - Aérea, com atomizadores rotativos de discos e A 3 - Aérea, com pontas hidráulicas. O fator B foi representado pelos inseticidas sendo: B 1 - tiametoxam + lambda-cialotrina e B 2 - acefato. As aplicações terrestres e aéreas com baixo volume oleoso apresentam maior eficiência no controle de percevejos na cultura da soja, refletindo-se este controle em maior rendimento de grãos.
