Preincubation of the washed cream with protease at pH 9. 0 and 37 ºC increased the subsequent rate of lipolysis. Rate of lipolysis {{was associated with}} the extent of proteolysis of the washed cream (r 2 =. 89). Preincubation of washed cream with phospholipase C at pH 7. 35 and 37 ºC did not affect subsequent lipolysis. Incubation of washed cream with protease and lipase as well as with phospholipase and lipase at pH 6. 65 and 37 ºC resulted in an increase in the initial rate of lipolysis. However, rate of lipolysis decreased after 2 h of incubation when <b>microbial</b> <b>protease</b> was present; this probably resulted from proteolytic inactivation of the lipase. <b>Microbial</b> <b>protease</b> and phospholipase C exhibited a synergistic effect in enhancing lipolysis for up to 4 h of incubation at 37 ºC, but this effect decreased with additional incubation.

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{soybean meal}} (SBM) is {{excellent}} {{source of protein}} in diets for poultry, it is sometimes inaccessible, costly and fluctuates in supply. The SBM can partially be replaced by full-fat SBM, but the meals prepared from raw full-fat soybean contain antinutritional factors. To avoid the risk of antinutritional factors, heat treatment is always advisable, but either excessive or under heating the soybean could negatively affect the quality. However, the potential for further improvement of SBM by supplementing with microbial enzymes has been suggested by many researchers. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the performance and ileal nutrient digestibility of birds fed on diets containing raw soybeans and supplemented with <b>microbial</b> <b>protease.</b> Methods A 3  ×  2 factorial, involving 3 levels of raw full-fat soybean (RFFS; 0, 45 or 75  g/kg of diet) and 2 levels of protease (0 or 15, 000 PROT/kg) was used. The birds were raised in a climate-controlled room. A nitrogen-free diet was also offered to a reference group from day 19 to 24 to determine protein and amino acid flow at the terminal ileum and calculate the standardized ileal digestibility of nutrients. On days 10, 24 and 35, body weight and feed leftover were recorded to calculate the body weight gain (BWG), feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR). On day 24, samples of ileal digesta were collected at least from two birds per replicate. Results When RFFS was increased from 0 to 75  g/kg of diet, the content of trypsin inhibitors was increased from 1747 to 10, 193 trypsin inhibitors unit (TIU) /g of diets, and feed consumption of birds was also reduced (P <  0. 05). Increasing RFFS level reduced the BWG from hatch 0 to 10 d (P <  0. 01) and hatch to 24 d (P <  0. 05). The BWG of birds from hatch to 35 was not significantly (P =  0. 07) affected. Feed intake was also reduced (P <  0. 05) during 0 to 35 d. However, protease supplementation improved (P <  0. 05) the BWG and FCR during 0 to 24 d. Rising levels of RFFS increased the weight of pancreas (P <  0. 001) and small intestine (P <  0. 001) at day 24. Except for methionine, apparent and the corresponding standardized ileal digestibility of CP and AA were reduced (P <  0. 01) by increasing levels of RFFS in diets. Conclusion This study showed that some commercial SBM could be replaced by RFFS in broiler diets, without markedly compromising productivity.

30|$|Proteases {{are present}} in all living forms as they are {{involved}} in various metabolic processes. They are mainly involved in hydrolysis of the peptide bonds (Gupta et al. 2002). Proteases are classified into six types based on the functional groups in their active sites. They are aspartic, cysteine, glutamic, metallo, serine, and threonine proteases. They are also classified as exo-peptidases and endo-peptidases, based on the position of the peptide bond cleavage. Proteases find a wide range of applications in food, pharmaceutical, leather and textile, detergent, diagnostics industries and also in waste management (Rao et al. 1998).

A series of experiments were conducted to determine effects of various protease inhibitors of synthetic, plant and microbial origin and a deaminase inhibitor on proteolytic activity of unadapted mixed rumen bacteria. Proteolytic activity was measured by the rate of release of 14 CH -lysine from 14 C-casein labelled by reductive methylation. The synthetic protease inhibitors, n-tosyl-llysine chlorometyl ketone, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, p chloromercuribenzoate, iodoacetate caused signif icant (p. 05) differences in total protein concentration between control and different levels of DIC during the incubation period. In the presence of 0. 1 mM DIC, ammonia concentration and net transamination of leucine were significantly (p <. 05) lower than the control throughout the entire incubation period. Leucine catabolic pathways, transamination and decarboxylation were equally inhibited at 0. 1 mM of DIC.

In the present work we have established in addition that PR 1 is specifically induced by insect cuticle, but not by other soluble or insoluble proteinaceous substrates. The feeding of elastin or collagen to derepressed established mycelium (starved for carbon and nitrogen) did not enhance PR 1 production significantly and the soluble proteins BSA and gelatin rapidly and completely repressed PR 1. The carbohydrate polymers cellulose and xylan gave derepressed basal levels of PR 1. However, addition of locust cuticle enhanced PR 1 production to a level approximately 10 -fold that of derepressed mycelium.

By removing P. gingivalis by phagocytosis, neutrophils also protect the host from the harmful effects of its <b>microbial</b> <b>proteases,</b> which degrade inflammatory cytokines and other host molecules...|$|R
30|$|However, various animals, plants, and <b>microbial</b> <b>proteases</b> {{have been}} {{suggested}} as milk coagulants (Zhang et al. 2011), but still attention {{has been focused on}} production of milk-clotting enzymes from microbial sources (Silveira et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2013) due to their rapid growth, relative inexpensive growth substrate, and diverse properties. Microbial rennet-like milk-clotting enzymes are aspartic proteases that catalyze milk coagulation. Although, there are some shortcomings when compared with traditional calf rennet, even then microbial rennet has been accepted in markets of several countries. In the US alone, about 60  % of the cheese is manufactured using fungal enzymes (Hashem 2000). Many microorganisms that produce milk-clotting enzymes, i.e., Rhizomucor miehei, Aspergillus oryzae, Enthothia parasitica, and Aspergillus flavo furcatis, are widely used (He et al. 2011; Li et al. 2012; Alecrim et al. 2015). In the case of microbial rennets from Mucor sp., none of the available reports contains any indication that the use of the enzyme in cheese manufacture is unsafe (Tubesha and Delaimy 2003).|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of addition of CO 2 to raw milk on UHT milk quality during storage. Control milk (without CO 2 addition) and treated milk (with CO 2 addition up to pH 6. 2) were stored in bulk tanks at 4 °C for 6 d. After storage, both samples were UHT processed using indirect heating (140 °C for 5 s). Samples were aseptically packed in low-density polyethylene pouches and stored in the dark at room temperature. Raw milk was evaluated upon receipt for physicochemical composition, proteolysis, lipolysis, standard plate count, psychrotrophic bacteria, and Pseudomonas spp. counts, and after 6 d of storage for proteolysis, lipolysis, and microbial counts. After processing, UHT milk samples were evaluated for physicochemical composition, proteolysis, and lipolysis. Samples were evaluated for proteolysis and lipolysis twice a month until 120 d. Peptides from pH 4. 6 -soluble N filtrates were performed by reversed-phase HPLC after 1 and 120 d of storage. A split-plot design was used and the complete experiment was carried out in triplicate. The results were evaluated by ANOVA and Tukey's test. After 6 d of storage, CO 2 -treated raw milk kept its physicochemical and microbiological quality, whereas the untreated milk showed significant quality losses. A significant increase in proteolysis occurred during 120 d of storage in both treatments, but the increase occurred 1. 4 times faster in untreated UHT milk than in CO 2 -treated UHT milk. In both UHT milks, the proteolysis was a consequence of the action of plasmin and microbial proteases. However, the untreated UHT milk showed higher <b>microbial</b> <b>protease</b> activity than the treated UHT milk. The addition of CO 2 to the raw milk maintained the quality during storage, resulting in UHT milk with less proteolysis and possibly longer shelf life, which is usually limited by age gelation of UHT milk. © 2012 American Dairy Science Association...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple method}} for the {{analysis}} of <b>microbial</b> <b>proteases</b> is described that was used to characterize the proteolytic activities of various Vibrio cholerae isolates. This method utilized the unique peptides generated from the degradation of a standard protein by proteases of various specificities. These peptides were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The unique patterns of peptides seen in gels can be used to type proteases according to their relative specificities. Culture supernatants of V. cholerae isolates from a variety of environmental and human sources were analyzed for the presence of a protease previously isolated and characterized in this laboratory from V. cholerae strain CA 401. Supernatants from most isolates showing dimethyl casein proteolytic activity exhibited the presence of enzymes similar to the CA 401 protease in their peptide digest patterns against bovine serum albumin and in their immunological reactivities. The probable widespread presence of this virulence-associated protease in V. cholerae isolates is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Inflammatory response, a {{standard}} clinical condition, {{is an important}} defense mechanism that protects the tissues from invasion by organisms and damaged cells. A variety of enzymes have been used extensively {{in the management of}} pro-tein deficiencies and therapeutic applications. Proteolytic enzymes can be administered with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Proteolytic enzymes such as chymotrypsin, trypsin and serratiopeptidase {{play an important role in}} the inflammatory processes (1). Proteases are found in living organisms including plants, animals, and microbes. In fact, microbe-derived proteolytic enzymes are extracted from or synthe-sized by bacterial and fungal sources such as streptokinase, a proteolytic enzyme preparation from β-hemolytic streptococci, brinase from Aspergillus oryzae, Sutilain, a proteolytic enzyme isolated from Bacillus subtilis, arazyme from Serratia proteamaculans, and bacterial toxins like tentoxilysin (tetanus neurotoxin), botulinum neu-rotoxin and anthrax toxin lethal factor (2 - 7). <b>Microbial</b> <b>proteases</b> can be divided into different classes, according to activity under acidic, neutral and alkaline environments, chemical characteris...|$|R
40|$|Potato leaves {{infected}} with Phytophthorainfestans produced a serine protease inhibitor (PLPKI) with specificity for <b>microbial</b> <b>proteases.</b> Sequencing {{of the first}} twenty residues at the NH 2 -terminus of the mature PLPKI polypeptide demonstrated that PLPKI is a novel member of the potato protease inhibitor I family. PLPKI inhibited the activity of extracellular proteases produced by two pathogens of potato, P. infestans and Rhizoctoniasolani, but was inactive against proteases secreted into the culture media by the binucleate Rhizoctonia N 2, a non-pathogenic fungus for potato. Western blot analysis showed {{a positive correlation between}} the levels of PLPKI and the degree of horizontal resistance, showing its highest accumulation in clone OKA 5632. 11, which has been described as highly resistant. This correlation, together with the ability of PLPKI to completely abolish the secreted serine protease activity of P. infestans, suggests that PLPKI may have an active role in protecting potato plants from this pathogenic oomycete and that it {{could be used as a}} suitable biochemical marker to help breeders in the selection of cultivars with high degree of horizontal resistance...|$|R

Proteases capable to in harsh condition of salinity, alkalinity and temperature etc are thus of great concern. Extracellular protease producing bacterium isolated from saline soil of Akola district was related to Bacillus licheniformis {{on the basis of}} biochemical and 16 S rDNA gene sequence similarity. The enzyme was active in the range of pH 6 – 10 with the optimum at 9. 0. Different carbon and nitrogen sources used in the study found increased protease production in Lactose and Yeast extract. The enzyme was highly stable at various NaCl concentrations retained 50 % activity after 4 hrs. Also, the enzyme was quite stable at higher temperature in the presence of KCl, NaCl and CaCl 2. Activity of this was affected by mono and divalent metal ions to varying extent. The study on this enzyme assumes significance with dual extremities of pH and salt also with moderate temperature stability.

40|$|Visual {{symptoms}} of leaf scald necrosis in sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) leaves develop in {{parallel to the}} accumulation of a fibrous material invading exocellular spaces and both xylem and phloem. These fibers are produced and secreted by the plant-associated bacterium Xanthomonas albilineans. Electron microscopy and specific staining methods for polysaccharides reveal the polysaccharidic nature of this material. These polysaccharides are not present in healthy leaves or in those from diseased plants without visual {{symptoms of}} leaf scald. Bacteria in several leaf tissues have been detected by immunogold labeling. The bacterial polysaccharide is not produced in axenic culture but it is actively synthesized when the microbes invade the host plant. This finding {{may be due to}} the production of plant glycoproteins, after bacteria infection which inhibit <b>microbial</b> <b>proteases.</b> In summary, our data are consistent with the existence of a positive feedback loop in which plant-produced glycoproteins act as a cell-to-bacteria signal that promotes xanthan production, by protecting some enzymes of xanthan biosynthesis against from bacterial proteolytic degradation. © 2011 Landes Bioscience.
