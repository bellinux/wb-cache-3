40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} efficient traffic shaping while providing QoS guarantees for Constant Bit Rate (CBR) sources. A simulation model is developed to capture the performance of several mechanisms that schedule cells according to the Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (GCRA) which is used for policing of connections. Results show that efficient shaping with QoS guarantees can be only achieved by a <b>multi-level</b> <b>priority</b> scheme. The suggested shaper mechanism absorbs the Cell Delay Variation of CBR cells and minimizes the buffer required at the receiver end...|$|E
40|$|The {{extension}} of the ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) protocol stack to the wireless segment requires {{the introduction of a}} MAC (medium access control) layer able to provide reliable connection services to the network layer. Two basic functions of the MAC layer are resource allocation and error control. In this paper we analyze these issues and consider a MAC scheme for TDMA systems based on ARQ (automatic repeat request) and a <b>multi-level</b> <b>priority</b> scheduling. The impact of radio channel characteristics and QoS requirements on the protocol design has been studied and a comparison of the ARQ-based approach and the classical approach based on FEC (forward error correction) and interleaving has been performed...|$|E
40|$|Intelligent {{transport}} systems (ITS) facilitate road traffic by periodically exchanging messages with neighbouring vehicles, road side units (RSUs) and ITS stations. For security reasons these messages will be encapsulated with security credentials to form secured messages (SMs) {{and will be}} inoperative until the authentication completes. This creates a challenge in a dynamic and dense road network where many SMs are awaiting authentication. To address this problem, we propose CAESAR, a criticality-aware Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signature verification scheme that utilizes <b>multi-level</b> <b>priority</b> queues (MLPQs) and Markov model to dispatch and schedule SMs. Simulation results verify the accuracy of CAESAR and the enhancements in terms of several safety awareness metrics compared with the existing schemes. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an integrated triangle mesh processing framework for surface reconstruction based on Delaunay triangulation. It features an innovative <b>multi-level</b> inheritance <b>priority</b> queuing mechanism for seeking and updating the optimum local manifold mesh at each data point. The proposed algorithms aim at generating a watertight triangle mesh interpolating all the input points data {{when all the}} fully matched local manifold meshes (umbrellas) are found. Compared to existing reconstruction algorithms, the proposed algorithms can automatically reconstruct watertight interpolation triangle mesh without additional hole-filling or manifold post-processing. The resulting surface can effectively recover the sharp features in the scanned physical object and capture their correct topology and geometric shapes reliably. The main Umbrella Facet Matching (UFM) algorithm and its two extended algorithms are documented in detail in the thesis. The UFM algorithm accomplishes and implements the core surface reconstruction framework based on a <b>multi-level</b> inheritance <b>priority</b> queuing mechanism according to the progressive matching results of local meshes. The first extended algorithm presents a new normal vector combinatorial estimation method for point cloud data depending on local mesh matching results, which is benefit to sharp features reconstruction. The second extended algorithm addresses the sharp-feature preservation issue in surface reconstruction by the proposed normal vector cone (NVC) filtering. The effectiveness of these algorithms has been demonstrated using both simulated and real-world point cloud data sets. For each algorithm, multiple case studies are performed and analyzed to validate its performance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDefining {{operational}} semantics for a process algebra is often based either on labeled transition systems {{that account for}} interaction with a context or on the so-called reduction semantics: we assume to have {{a representation of the}} whole system and we compute unlabeled reduction transitions (leading to a distribution over states in the probabilistic case). In this paper we consider mixed models with states where the system is still open (towards interaction with a context) and states where the system is already closed. The idea is that (open) parts of a system “P” can be closed via an operator “P↑G” that turns already synchronized actions whose “handle” is specified inside “G” into prioritized reduction transitions (and, therefore, states performing them into closed states). We show that we can use the operator “P↑G” to express <b>multi-level</b> <b>priorities</b> and external probabilistic choices (by assigning weights to handles inside G), and that, by considering reduction transitions as the only unobservable τ transitions, the proposed technique is compatible, for process algebra with general recursion, with both standard (probabilistic) observational congruence and a notion of equivalence which aggregates reduction transitions in a (much more aggregating) trace based manner. We also observe that the trace-based aggregated transition system can be obtained directly in {{operational semantics}} and we present the “aggregating” semantics. Finally, we discuss how the open/closed approach can be used to also express discrete and continuous (exponential probabilistic) time and we show that, in such timed contexts, the trace-based equivalence can aggregate more with respect to traditional lumping based equivalences over Markov Chains...|$|R
40|$|The {{controlled}} load service defined within the IETF's Integrated Services architecture for quality-of-service (QoS) in the Internet requires source nodes to regulate their traffic while the network, {{in combination with}} an admission control strategy, provides a guarantee of performance equivalent to that achieved in a lightly loaded network. Packets sent {{in violation of the}} traffic contract are marked so that the network may assign them a lower priority in the use of bandwidth and buffer resources. In this paper, we define the requirements of a scheduler serving packets belonging to the {{controlled load}} service and present a novel scheduler that exactly achieves these requirements. In this set of requirements, besides efficiency and throughput, we include an additional important requirement to bound the additional delay of unmarked packets caused due to the transmission of marked packets while dropping as few marked packets as possible. Without such a bound, unmarked packets that are in compliance with the traffic contract are not likely to experience delays consistent with that in a lightly loaded network. For any given desired bound # on this additional delay, we present the CL(#) scheduler which achieves the bound while also achieving a per-packet work complexity of O(1) with respect to the number of flows. We provide an analytical proof of these properties of the CL(#) scheduler, and we also verify this with simulation using real traces of video traffic. The scheduler presented here may be readily adapted for use in scheduling flows with <b>multi-level</b> <b>priorities</b> such as in some real-time video streams, as well as in other emerging service models of the Internet that mark packets to identify drop precedences...|$|R
30|$|Sengar and Bhardwaj [11] {{discussed}} {{applications of}} WSN and various attacks (such as active and passive attacks) incorporated with it. They also discuss {{the importance of}} trust and fairness of the data transferred from source to destination. The approach proposed by Tang et al. [12] presents a secure routing algorithm with a selection of the shortest path and deterministic strategies to normalize the power consumption, and supports different routing methods to secure the data. However, this strategy may fail as {{the energy of the}} node is not considered which is the main constraint in WSNs. Rashmi and Archana [13] proposed a model in which dynamic <b>multi-level</b> <b>priority</b> (DMP) for scheduling the packets with bit rate categorization and Rivest cipher 6 (RC 6) algorithm is used for providing security to WSN.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a priority-based technique for {{the delivery of}} compressed prerecorded video streams across best-effort networks. This technique uses a <b>multi-level</b> <b>priority</b> queue {{in conjunction with a}} delivery window to help smooth the video frame rate delivered to the end user while allowing it to easily adapt to changing network conditions. Compared with current approaches, our priority-based approach has several advantages. First, it acts more globally by ensuring that a minimum frame rate for the window interval has been delivered before sending enhancement layers. Second, this approach is much simpler to implement than other frame smoothing algorithms that have been presented for the delivery of stored video across best-effort networks. Finally, this approach is directly applicable for the shaping of MPEG-based video encodings with frame dependencies.

30|$|In {{order to}} address the {{problems}} outlined above, in this paper, we propose an efficient anonymous authentication scheme for VANETs based on message priority and vehicle cooperation. We adopt the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) [23] for message encryption, as it requires less computation overhead with noticeably smaller keys compared with other existing algorithms. In addition, we employ the batch authentication in the proposed scheme that vehicles can authenticate multiple messages at a time to reduce the time for authentication [24]. We classify all received messages into <b>multi-level</b> <b>priority</b> queue (MLPQ) before authentication. Inspired by the observation that messages from vehicles nearby are more important, as they may contain information that immediately impacts the current vehicle, we group received messages based on the received signal strength. The messages sent from closer vehicles represent higher safety concern for ITS safety applications. Thus, our scheme enables these messages to be authenticated preferentially so as to retain important information. Moreover, we introduce a cooperative authentication mechanism, where RSUs and vehicles participate in cooperation, so that authenticated messages can be shared with low computation overhead. To encourage vehicles to participate in cooperation, we adopt a reverse auction mechanism to award vehicle participation.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{priority}} system which is particularly suited for production rules coupled to databases. In this system, there are default priorities between all rules and overriding user-defined priorities between particular rules. Rule processing using {{this system is}} repeatable: for a given set of rules and priorities, the rules are considered for execution {{in the same order}} if the same set of transactions is executed twice on the same initial database state. The rule order adheres to the default order as closely as possible: rules are considered in the same order as the default order unless user-defined precedence constraints force an inversion. We present data structures an efficient algorithms for implementing such a priority system. We show how the data structures can be incrementally maintained as user- defined priorities are altered. We also discuss how the proposed scheme can be extended to build a <b>multi-level</b> hierarchical <b>priority</b> system...|$|R
40|$|Most {{commercial}} {{project management}} software packages include planning methods to devise schedules for resource-constrained projects. As it is proprietary information {{of the software}} vendors which planning methods are implemented, the question arises how the software packages differ in quality {{with respect to their}} resource-allocation capabilities. We experimentally evaluate the resource-allocation capabilities of eight recent software packages by using 1, 560 instances with 30, 60, and 120 activities of the well-known PSPLIB library. In some of the analyzed packages, the user may influence the resource allocation by means of <b>multi-level</b> <b>priority</b> rules, whereas in other packages, only few options can be chosen. We study the impact of various complexity parameters and priority rules on the project duration obtained by the software packages. The results indicate that the resource-allocation capabilities of these packages differ significantly. In general, the relative gap between the packages gets larger with increasing resource scarcity and with increasing number of activities. Moreover, the selection of the priority rule has a considerable impact on the project duration. Surprisingly, when selecting a priority rule in the packages where it is possible, both the mean and the variance of the project duration are in general worse than for the packages which do not offer the selection of a priority rule...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} of the third generation (3 G) mobile networks is their capability to provide different classes of services; especially multimedia and real-time services {{in addition to the}} traditional telephony and data services. These new services, however, will require higher Quality of Service (QoS) constraints on the network mainly regarding delay, delay variation and packet loss. Additionally, the overall traffic profile in both the air interface and inside the network will be rather different than used to be in today's mobile networks. Therefore, providing QoS for the new services will require more than what a call admission control algorithm can achieve at the border of the network, but also continuous buffer control in both the wireless and the fixed part of the network to ensure that higher priority traffic is treated in the proper way. This paper proposes and analytically evaluates a buffer management scheme that is based on <b>multi-level</b> <b>priority</b> and Complete Buffer Sharing (CBS) policy for all buffers at the border and inside the wireless network. The analytical model is based on the G/G/ 1 /N censored queue with single server and R (R¿ 2) priority classes under the Head of Line (HoL) service rule for the CBS scheme. The traffic is modelled using the Generalised Exponential distribution. The paper presents an analytical solution based on the approximation using the Maximum Entropy (ME) principle. The numerical results show the capability of the buffer management scheme to provide higher QoS for the higher priority service classes...|$|E
