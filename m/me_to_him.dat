25|$|When my father, who {{had been}} {{appointed}} by his country as public notary in the customs at Bugia acting for the Pisan merchants going there, was in charge, he summoned <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> while I was still a child, and having an eye to usefulness and future convenience, desired me to stay there and receive instruction {{in the school of}} accounting. There, when I had been introduced to the art of the Indians' nine symbols through remarkable teaching, knowledge of the art very soon pleased me above all else and I came to understand it.|$|E
25|$|Kirkman was {{inspired}} to box by his older brother, Steve, whom he frequently sparred with for fun. A school friend who noticed his {{lack of interest in}} reading suggested the book Somebody Up There Likes <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> In a short time, he had finished the book. Shortly thereafter, the book was made into a self-titled film, to which Kirkman was elated to discover. The duo convinced Kirkman that his future lay in boxing. Kirkman's first training sessions at age 14 involved traveling to a south Seattle gymnasium to work out from his school in Renton, Washington. The venue was suggested to him by former professional Joey Velez. Kirkman took a year-long hiatus from boxing due to injury, but returned to the gym and won several local Golden Gloves events afterward, slowly building a reputation.|$|E
500|$|In a small essay, [...] "Shmendrick, My Mephistopheles", one of {{the last}} {{passages}} he wrote, Adler describes the last time he saw Shmendrick played, at a memorial for Goldfaden in 1912. Lamenting the choice of play for the memorial—"Goldfaden has written better things"—he nonetheless acknowledges, [...] "that same bitter Shmendrick was our livelihood... I gritted my teeth. I called on the ghosts of Aristophanes, of Shakespeare, of Lope de Vega. I wept and swallowed my own tears... And I cursed the fate that bound <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>him...</b> Yet even as I cursed and condemned, the tears rose. For my whole life, my whole past, was before me on that stage... Poor weak first step of our Yiddish theater... I thank you for the happiness you gave us... I thank you Shmendrick—my beloved—my own." ...|$|E

2500|$|Director Frank Lloyd was casting for {{the part}} of high-society flapper Janet Oglethorpe, and more than 50 women, most with {{previous}} screen experience, auditioned. Bow reminisced: [...] "He had not found {{exactly what he wanted}} and finally somebody suggested <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> When I came into his office a big smile came over his face and he looked just tickled to death." [...] Lloyd told the press, [...] "Bow is the personification of the ideal aristocratic flapper, mischievous, pretty, aggressive, quick-tempered and deeply sentimental." [...] It was released on January 4, 1924.|$|E
2500|$|He {{spent his}} time with Long, and the two would swim, ride, read, and talk with each other. However, they shared a fear of {{becoming}} overweight, and this {{marked the beginning of}} Byron's [...] "Thinning Campaign". Long was not Byron's only companion during this time; he had a short-lived friendship with John Edleston, a fifteen-year-old choirboy. About his [...] "protégé" [...] he wrote, [...] "He has been my almost constant associate since October, 1805. His voice first attracted my attention, his countenance fixed it, and his manners attached <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for ever." [...] The boy gave Byron a carnelian ring, in return for saving his life, and to which Byron wrote The Cornelian in October 1806: ...|$|E
2500|$|For a long time, Sam Raimi {{had been}} {{interested}} in adapting a comic book into a film. He had pursued and failed to secure the rights to both The Shadow and Batman and decided to create his own. The initial idea Raimi had for Darkman was {{of a man who}} could change his face. He has said that he drew inspiration from those films as well as The Phantom of the Opera and The Elephant Man. Raimi was also inspired by the Universal horror films of the 1930s and 1940s because [...] "they made me fear the hideous nature of the hero {{and at the same time}} drew <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> I went back to that idea of the man who is noble and turns into a monster". He originally wrote a 30-page short story, titled [...] "The Darkman", and then developed into a 40-page treatment. At this point, according to Raimi, [...] "it became the story of a man who had lost his face and had to take on other faces, a man who battled criminals using this power". It also became more of a tragic love story in the tradition of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. In 1987, Raimi submitted the treatment to Universal Pictures which they liked, green-lighted a budget in the range of $8–12 million, and suggested that he get a screenwriter to flesh out the story.|$|E
