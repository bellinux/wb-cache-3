Harrison engaged Whitelaw Reid, minister to France, and William Walter Phelps, minister to Germany, to restore these exports for the country without delay. Harrison also successfully asked the congress to enact the <b>Meat</b> <b>Inspection</b> Act to eliminate the accusations of product compromise. The president also partnered with Agriculture Secretary Rusk to threaten Germany with retaliation – by initiating an embargo in the U.S. against Germany's highly demanded beet sugar. By September 1891 Germany relented, and was soon followed by Denmark, France and Austria-Hungary.|$|E

25|$|Roosevelt {{responded to}} public {{anger over the}} abuses in the food packing {{industry}} by pushing Congress to pass the <b>Meat</b> <b>Inspection</b> Act of 1906 and the Pure Food and Drug Act. Though conservatives initially opposed the bill, Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, published in 1906, helped galvanize support for reform. The <b>Meat</b> <b>Inspection</b> Act of 1906 banned misleading labels and preservatives that contained harmful chemicals. The Pure Food and Drug Act banned food and drugs that were impure or falsely labeled from being made, sold, and shipped. Roosevelt also served as honorary president of the American School Hygiene Association from 1907 to 1908, and in 1909 he convened the first White House Conference on the Care of Dependent Children.|$|E
25|$|Raw meats {{may also}} contain harmful parasites. As with bacteria, these parasites are {{destroyed}} during the heat processing of cooking meat or manufacturing pet foods. Some raw diet recipes call for freezing meat before serving it, which greatly reduces (but {{does not necessarily}} eliminate) extant parasites. According to a former European Union directive, freezing fish at -20°C (-4°F) for 24 hours kills parasites. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends freezing at -35°C (-31°F) for 15 hours, or at -20°C (-4°F) for 7 days. The most common parasites in fish are roundworms from the family Anisakidae and fish tapeworm. While freezing pork at -15°C (5°F) for 20 days will kill any Trichinella spiralis worm, trichinosis is rare in countries with well established <b>meat</b> <b>inspection</b> programs, with cases of trichinosis in humans in the United States mostly coming from consumption of raw or undercooked wild game. Trichinella species in wildlife are resistant to freezing. In dogs and cats symptoms of trichinellosis would include mild gastrointestinal upset (vomiting and diarrhea) and in rare cases, muscle pain and muscle stiffness.|$|E

500|$|After the 1997 provincial election, Klein {{appointed}} Stelmach Minister of Agriculture, Food, and Rural development. While he {{held this}} office, his department encouraged {{the establishment of}} feedlots. The opposition parties charged {{that the government was}} not regulating these sufficiently, but Stelmach responded that municipalities had the authority necessary to effectively regulate them. On the Canadian Wheat Board controversy, Stelmach sided with farmers who wanted an end to the federal body's monopoly on grain sales in the western provinces. Legislatively, Stelmach sponsored five bills while in the Agriculture, Food, and Rural Development portfolio, all of which passed through the legislature. [...] 1997's <b>Meat</b> <b>Inspection</b> Amendment Act required meat inspectors to acquire a search warrant before entering a private dwelling, but also allowed for fines to be voluntarily paid without requiring a court case. It was called by Liberal agriculture critic Ken Nicol [...] "a really good bill". The Livestock and Livestock Products Amendment Act of the same year eliminated government guarantee of the Livestock Patrons' Assurance Fund, designed to protect cattle producers from payment defaults by livestock dealers, in favour of leaving the Fund entirely {{in the hands of the}} industry. It too was supported by the Liberals, with Nicol calling it [...] "very easy for us to accept". [...] In 1998, Stelmach sponsored the Agriculture Statutes (Penalties) Amendment Act, which overhauled the penalty system for violation of various agricultural statutes, setting maximum fines and leaving the precise amount up to judges on a case by case basis. It also passed with Liberal support, as MLA Ed Gibbons said that it [...] "really makes a lot of sense". Another 1998 bill was the Marketing of Agricultural Products Amendment Act, which allowed provincial agricultural marketing boards to revise their marketing plans, and was supported by the opposition. [...] Finally, Stelmach initiated the Agriculture Statutes (Livestock Identification) Amendment Act, which allowed the government to delegate the inspection of branding to the cattle industry. The bill was the subject of considerable debate on second reading, but was ultimately supported by the Liberals on the third and final reading.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, the <b>Meat</b> <b>Inspection</b> Act of 1891 was put {{in place}} in the United States because local butchers felt the {{refrigerated}} railcar system was unwholesome. [...] When meat packing began to take off, consumers became nervous {{about the quality of the}} meat for consumption. Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel The Jungle brought negative attention to the meat packing industry, by drawing to light unsanitary working conditions and processing of diseased animals. The book caught the attention of President Theodore Roosevelt, and the 1906 <b>Meat</b> <b>Inspection</b> Act {{was put in}}to place as an amendment to the <b>Meat</b> <b>Inspection</b> Act of 1891.

2500|$|The Progressive {{movement}} and the Progressive Era that emerged from it was in part a reaction to excesses of the new industrial age.

2500|$|Farm Sanctuary member Michael Baur, a {{professor}} at the Fordham University School of Law, filed an unsuccessful petition in 1998 with the USDA claiming the consumption of downed animals created a serious risk of transmission of some progressive neurological diseases, including bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease. The subsequent lawsuit, Baur v. Veneman, claimed then-current USDA regulations on downed livestock violated the Federal <b>Meat</b> <b>Inspection</b> Act. Southern District of New York Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald dismissed the case for lack of standing in 2002, but the 2nd Circuit reversed Buchwald's decision on December 16, 2003.

The goal {{of this study was}} to improve our understanding of bTB epidemiology in Burkina Faso and especially Mycobacterium bovis transmission within and between the bovine and human populations. Methodology/principal findings: Twenty six M. bovis strains were isolated from 101 cattle carcasses with suspected bTB lesions during routine <b>meat</b> <b>inspections</b> at the Bobo Dioulasso and Ouagadougou slaughterhouses. In addition, 7 M. bovis strains were isolated from 576 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Spoligotyping, RDAf 1 deletion and MIRU-VNTR typing were used for strains genotyping. The isolation of M. bovis strains was confirmed by spoligotyping and 12 spoligotype signatures were detected. Together, the spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR data allowed grouping the 33 M. bovis isolates in seven clusters including isolates exclusively from cattle (5) or humans (1) or from both (1). Moreover, these data (genetic analyses and phenetic tree) showed that the M. bovis isolates belonged to the African 1 (Af 1) clonal complex (81. 8 %) and the putative African 5 (Af 5) clonal complex (18. 2 %), in agreement with the results of RDAf 1 deletion typing.

The use of animal models or human volunteers is not expedient for various reasons; the use of epidemiological data is often hampered by lack of crucial data. In this paper, we describe a static, sequential gastrointestinal tract (GIT) model system in which foodborne pathogens are exposed to simulated gastric and intestinal contents of the human digestive tract, including the interaction of pathogens with the intestinal epithelium. The system can be employed with any foodborne bacterial pathogens. Five strains of Salmonella Heidelberg and one strain of Salmonella Typhimurium {{were used to assess}} the robustness of the system. Four S. Heidelberg strains originated from an outbreak, the fifth S. Heidelberg strain and the S.
