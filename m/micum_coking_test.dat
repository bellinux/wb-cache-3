40|$|A high {{pressure}} fuel <b>coking</b> <b>testing</b> apparatus was designed and developed and {{was used to evaluate}} thermal decomposition limits and carbon decomposition rates in heated copper tubes for hydrocarbon fuels. A commercial propane (90 % grade) and chemically pure (CP) propane were tested. Heat transfer to supercritical propane was evaluated at 136 atm, bulk fluid velocities of 6 to 30 m/s, and tube wall temperatures in the range of 422 to 811 K. A forced convection heat transfer correlation developed in a previous test effort verified a prediction of most of the experimental data within a + or - 30 % range, with good agreement for the CP propane data. No significant differences were apparent in the predictions derived from the correlation when the carbon resistance was included with the film resistance.

40|$|Automated imaging {{techniques}} were refined to characterise {{the rank and}} maceral composition of coals by a full maceral reflectogram of polished coal grain mounts. Precision was improved by processing individual grains in each image separately and correcting within the software for the topography that occurs between the different macerals and minerals in the grains. Maceral group proportions and vitrinite reflectance information extracted from these reflectograms compared well with manual results for a comprehensive suite of Australian coals varying in rank from a mean vitrinite reflectance of 0. 48 - 2. 13 %. A parameter that combines rank and type calculated from the reflectograms correlated strongly with chemical properties determined by ultimate and proximate analyses.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program was}} conducted to study deposit formation in hydrocarbon fuels under flow conditions that exist in high-pressure, rocket engine cooling systems. A high pressure fuel <b>coking</b> <b>test</b> apparatus was designed and developed and {{was used to evaluate}} thermal decomposition (coking) limits and carbon deposition rates in heated copper tubes for two hydrocarbon rocket fuels, RP- 1 and commercial-grade propane. Tests were also conducted using JP- 7 and chemically-pure propane as being representative of more refined cuts of the baseline fuels. A parametric evaluation of fuel thermal stability was performed at pressures of 136 atm to 340 atm, bulk fuel velocities in the range 6 to 30 m/sec, and tube wall temperatures in the range 422 to 811 K. In addition, the effect of the inside wall material on deposit formation was evaluated in selected tests which were conducted using nickel-plated tubes. The results of the tests indicated that substantial deposit formation occurs with RP- 1 fuel at wall temperatures between 600 and 800 K, with peak deposit formation occurring near 700 K. No improvements were obtained when de-oxygenated JP- 7 fuel was substituted for RP- 1. The carbon deposition rates for the propane fuels were generally higher than those obtained for either of the kerosene fuels at any given wall temperature. There appeared to be little difference between commercial-grade and chemically-pure propane with regard to type and quantity of deposit. The results of tests conducted with RP- 1 indicated that the rate of deposit formation increased slightly with pressure over the range 136 atm to 340 atm. Finally, plating the inside wall of the tubes with nickel was found to significantly reduce carbon deposition rates for RP- 1 fuel...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-stage}} {{study was}} undertaken to establish what effect, if any, perchloroethylene has on coal coking properties. Stage 1 was a kinetic {{study in which}} the Gieseler fluidity of samples of a high fluidity coal was measured over a 64 -week period. Two of the samples were left untreated, with one stored in air and one immersed in water. The third sample was also stored in air, but was soaked in perchloroethylene for 2 h and then air dried immediately prior to fluidity testing. In Stage 2, seven different coking coals were studied, covering three different Australian coal measures and {{a wide range of}} coking rank. For each coal, a 40 kg clean coal composite was formed using laboratory water-based methods, a Reflux Classier for the 0. 038 – 0. 25 mm and 0. 25 – 2. 0 mm size fractions and a Mintek jig for the 2. 0 – 16 and 16 – 50 mm size fractions. This 40 kg composite was then subdivided into four sub-samples. Samples A and B were coked immediately, whereas Samples C and D were stored in open trays at ambient conditions for a month before coking. Samples B and D were soaked in perchloroethylene for 2 h and then air dried prior to coke testing, whereas Samples A and C were left untreated. Coal properties were measured prior to coking, and after coking the NSC Coke Reactivity Index (CRI) and Coke Strength after Reaction (CSR) were measured. In Stage 1 it was found that storage under water was able to maintain the sample fluidity better than refrigerated storage. The combined Stage 1 and 2 results showed that perchloroethylene had a detrimental effect on the coking properties of many coals. Hence <b>coking</b> <b>tests</b> on clean coal composites formed using heavy organic liquids may often under predict a coal’s true coking properties. This could lead to many coal deposits being undervalued. Perchloroethylene had the largest detrimental effect on the fluidity, CRI and CSR of coals that started with relatively poor properties. Perchloroethylene had a negligible effect on coals with relatively good initial coking properties. There was no clear correlation with vitrinite reflectance. The three most seriously affected coals all had relatively high inertinite content. It is speculated that the higher porosity of inertinite might allow greater access and retention of perchloroethylene in the coal particles. The laboratory water-based methods were able to produce clean coal composites that matched the proximate, petrographic and coal swelling number properties of the coal preparation plant product. The dilatometer and fluidity results were lower than those of the coal preparation plant, but this {{can be explained by the}} up to three month delay between mining of the original sample and the coking of the composite. These delays were an unavoidable part of the research nature of this project and had nothing to do with the water based methods deployed. If these water-based methods of preparing clean-coal composites were to become standardized, then there is no reason why a well equipped coal testing facility could not receive a refrigerated bore core and produce a clean coal composite within the period of a week...|$|R

It was shown that steaming has {{a significant impact on}} the porosity, acidity, and reactivity of the zeolite materials. The catalytic performance, tested by the styrene oligomerization and methanol-to-olefin reactions, led to the conclusion that mild steaming conditions resulted in greatly enhanced acidity and reactivity of dealuminated zeolite ZSM- 5. Interestingly, only residual surface mesoporosity was generated in the mildly steamed ZSM- 5 zeolite, leading to rapid crystal coloration and <b>coking</b> upon catalytic <b>testing</b> and indicating an enhanced deactivation of the zeolites. In contrast, harsh steaming conditions generated 5 – 50 nm mesopores, extensively improving the accessibility of the zeolites. However, severe dealumination decreased the strength of the Brønsted acid sites, causing a depletion of the overall acidity, which resulted in a major drop in catalytic activity...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{growth of}} the steel {{industry}} in coming years will be strongly dependent upon coal. Understanding of coal behavior in current or emerging ironmaking processes will require improved understanding of coal transformation during direct injection or after carbonization. Recent studies have highlighted the significance of coke minerals on coke reactivity such that the reactivity was shown to increase with increasing contents of magnetite, pyrrhotite, and metallic iron. Therefore, {{it is imperative to}} understand how coal minerals transform during carbonization particularly at higher temperatures and how mineral transformation is influenced by carbonization and heat treatment conditions and, in turn, how the transformed minerals affect reactivity. However, there is limited information available about transformation of coal minerals as a function of coal properties, carbonization and heat treatment conditions. In this study, the effect of coal mineral transformation was investigated, particularly iron-bearing minerals on coke reactivity. Effect of high heating rate on coal mineral transformations was studied in a TGA reactor. Carbonization tests were conducted in a 100 g and a 9 kg coke oven. Coal devolatilization and coke annealing were examined under controlled conditions in a horizontal tube furnace. The mineralogy of coal and coke was analyzed using XRD, QEMSCAN and FESEM/EDS. Implications of minerals transformation on coke reactivity with CO 2 was studied in a fixed bed reactor at 1173 K. The study demonstrated that total volatile yield of lump coals was not influenced by either the tested range of temperature or particle size. The devolatilization rates of coal decreased with increasing size of coal, however for coal lumps above 10 mm there appeared to be little effect of particle size. The swelling tendency of lump coals increased with increasing volatile content, particle size and heating rate. Swelling ratio based on measurements of physical dimensions of individual large coal particle or lump coal did not have any relation to the free swelling index commonly reported by the existing <b>coking</b> <b>tests.</b> The study showed that low swelling coals may be more vulnerable to cracking. The study showed that both the apparent reaction rates of cokes and chars made from the same coals were modified greatly under different carbonization conditions and the differences were much greater than those seen with different coal types. The micropore surface areas and the carbon structure of cokes were also significantly influenced by heating rate, soaking time and temperatures during carbonization and thermal treatment, however the initial apparent reaction rates of cokes and chars was not strongly related to either carbon crystallite height, micropore surface area of cokes and chars or rank and maceral composition of the parent coals as seen in the past for cokes. The study also demonstrated the strong influence of carbonization conditions on the transformation of coal minerals. In particular the magnitude and type of potential catalytic iron minerals mainly iron sulfide, metallic iron and iron oxide were affected by the carbonization conditions. At higher temperatures they transformed to non-catalytic iron minerals mainly silicide. The initial reactivities of cokes and chars with CO 2 increased with increasing amounts of the catalytic iron minerals present and this relationship was found to be independent of carbonization conditions as well as heat treatment temperature at total catalyst levels below 1. 0 wt%. However, at greater catalyst levels CO 2 reaction rate was less sensitive to the total amount of catalytic iron phases. The initial apparent reaction rate of cokes annealed at higher temperature (1773 K) significantly decreased due to decreased levels of catalytic iron minerals as well as increased ordering of the carbon structure. The catalytic impact of minerals on reactivity was also found to decline with progressive gasification. This study suggests that transformation of coal iron minerals to potential catalytic iron-bearing minerals in coke can be optimized by suitable selection of carbonization conditions and hence to control coke quality particularly gasification reactivity. The study demonstrates that understanding of high temperature performance of coal matter, particularly coal mineral matter is important to optimize coke quality for both current and emerging blast furnace operations. The quantitative mineralogical analysis suggests that transformation of iron-bearing minerals in coal to catalytic iron phases in coke may be optimized by controlling the heating rate and temperature during carbonization. Further understanding of the influence of coal mineral grain size and morphology on the distribution as well as the catalytic intensity of iron and calcium species in coke is required on establishing a quantitative relationship with coke quality parameters particularly reactivity...|$|R
30|$|The {{oxidation}} kinetics, {{surface morphology}} and phase structure of oxide films grown on 25 Cr 20 Ni alloy in air-H 2 O and H 2 -H 2 O atmospheres at 900 °C for 20 h were investigated. The anti-coking performance {{and resistance to}} carburization of the two oxide films were compared using 25 Cr 20 Ni alloy tubes with an inner diameter of 10 mm and a length of 850 mm in a bench scale naphtha steam pyrolysis unit. The oxidation kinetics followed a parabolic law in an air-H 2 O atmosphere and a logarithm law in a H 2 -H 20 atmosphere in the steady-state stage. The oxide film grown in the air-H 2 O atmosphere had cracks where the elements Fe and Ni were enriched and the un-cracked area was covered with octahedral-shaped MnCr 2 O 4 spinels and Cr 1, 3 Fe 0.7 O 3 oxide clusters, while the oxide film grown in the H 2 -H 2 O atmosphere was intact and completely covered with dense standing blade MnCr 2 O 4 spinels. In the pyrolysis tests, the anti-coking performance and resistance to carburization of the oxide film grown in the H 2 -H 2 O atmosphere were far better than that in the air-H 20 atmosphere. The mass of coke formed in the oxide film grown in the H 2 -H 2 O atmosphere was less than 10 % {{of that in the}} air-H 2 O atmosphere. The Cr 1.3 Fe 0.7 O 3 oxide clusters converted into Cr 23 C 6 carbides and the cracks were filled with carbon in the oxide film grown in the air-H 2 O atmosphere after repeated <b>coking</b> and decoking <b>tests,</b> while the dense standing blade MnCr 2 O 4 spinels remained unchanged in the oxide film grown in the H 2 -H 2 O atmosphere. The ethylene, propylene and butadiene yields in the pyrolysis tests were almost the same for the two oxide films.|$|R
40|$|This project {{focused on}} fuel stream {{preparation}} improvements prior to injection into a solid oxide fuel cell reformer. Each milestone {{and the results}} from each milestone are discussed in detail in this report. The first two milestones were {{the creation of a}} <b>coking</b> formation <b>test</b> rig and various testing performed on this rig. Initial tests indicated that three anti-carbon coatings showed improvement over an uncoated (bare metal) baseline. However, in follow-up 70 hour tests of the down selected coatings, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis revealed that no carbon was generated on the test specimens. These follow-up tests were intended to enable a down selection to a single best anti-carbon coating. Without the formation of carbon it was impossible to draw conclusions as to which anti-carbon coating showed the best performance. The final 70 hour tests did show that AMCX AMC 26 demonstrated the lowest discoloration of the metal out of the three down selected anti-carbon coatings. This discoloration did not relate to carbon but could be a useful result when carbon growth rate is not the only concern. Unplanned variations in the series of tests must be considered and may have altered the results. Reliable conclusions could only be drawn from consistent, repeatable testing beyond the allotted time and funding for this project. Milestones 3 and 4 focused on the creation of a preheating pressure atomizer and mixing chamber. A design of experiment test helped identify a configuration of the preheating injector, Build 1, which showed a very uniform fuel spray flow field. This injector was improved upon by the creation of a Build 2 injector. Build 2 of the preheating injector demonstrated promising SMD results with only 22 psi fuel pressure and 0. 7 in H 2 O of Air. It was apparent from testing and CFD that this Build 2 has flow field recirculation zones. These recirculation zones may suggest that this Build 2 atomizer and mixer would require steam injection to reduce the auto ignition potential. It is also important to note that to achieve uniform mixing within a short distance, some recirculation is necessary. Milestone 5 generated CFD and FEA results {{that could be used to}} optimize the preheating injector. CFD results confirmed the recirculation zones seen in test data and confirmed that the flow field would not change when attached to a reformer. The FEA predicted fuel wetted wall temperatures which led to several suggested improvements that could possibly improve nozzle efficiency. Milestone 6 (originally an optional task) took a different approach than the preheating pressure atomizer. It focused on creation and optimization of a piezoelectric injector which could perform at extremely low fuel pressures. The piezoelectric atomizer showed acceptable SMD results with fuel pressure less than 1. 0 psig and air pressure less than 1. 0 in H 2 O. These SMD values were enhanced when a few components were changed, and it is expected would improve further still at elevated air temperatures. It was demonstrated that the piezoelectric injector could accomplish the desired task. The addition of phase tracking and a burst mode to the frequency controller increased the usability of the piezoelectric injector. This injector is ready to move on to the next phase of development. Engine Components has met the required program milestones of this project. Some of the Milestones were adjusted to allow Milestone 6 to be completed in parallel with the other Milestones. Because of this, Task 3. 10 and 3. 13 were made optional instead of Milestone 6. Engine Components was extremely grateful for the support that was provided by NETL in support of this work...|$|R
