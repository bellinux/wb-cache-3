5|$|Nine years later, the Russian Federation {{handed over}} {{transcripts}} of Soviet military communications {{that showed that}} at least two documented search and rescue (SAR) missions were ordered within a half-hour of the attack to the last Soviet verified location of the descending jumbo jet, over Moneron Island: The first search was ordered from Smirnykh Air Base in central Sakhalin at 18:47 UTC, nine minutes after KAL007 had disappeared from Soviet radar screens, and brought rescue helicopters from Khomutovo Air base (the civilian and <b>military</b> <b>airport</b> at Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City in southern Sakhalin), and Soviet Border Troops boats to the area.|$|E
5|$|Norving (previously Varangfly) started {{offering}} {{flights to}} the closed-down <b>military</b> <b>airport</b> in 1970 using their newly delivered Britten-Norman Islander. The background was a landing at the airfield to transport {{a baby to}} Kirkenes Hospital. The Civil Aviation Administration stated {{that they were not}} opposed to building smaller ambulance airports, but that the state's priority was constructing a network of regional airports. The service started off with a daily round trip ordered by the district physician; patients had priority, but the airline would transport other passengers as well. After a month a second daily round trip was introduced.|$|E
5|$|In October and November 1994, {{during the}} Siege of Bihać, the Muslim-Croat Federation {{launched}} a large offensive {{around the town}} of Bihać, in far northwestern Bosnia. The Serbs soon launched a counterattack, and in support of their operations, launched air strikes with aircraft based at a former JNA <b>military</b> <b>airport</b> in Udbina, south of Bihać, located in the Republic of Serbian Krajina. The Serb aircraft dropped napalm and cluster bombs. Although most of the ordnance came from old, unreliable stocks and failed to explode, the attacks were a clear violation of the no-fly zone, and a challenge to NATO. NATO immediately looked for ways to respond, but its forces were not permitted to carry out operations in Croatian airspace, and due to Bihać's proximity to the border, Serb aircraft could attack into Bosnia, then cross back into Croatia before being intercepted. As such, NATO was powerless to stop the incursions.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} commission {{found no}} fault of the pilot or air traffic control, instead focusing on short-cuts being taken by the Swedish Air Force and the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) to not configure <b>military</b> <b>airports</b> in line with civilian regulations. The finding caused a surge of funding which subsequently caused <b>military</b> <b>airports</b> to change their instrument landing system and approach lighting system to meet civilian requirements.|$|R

5|$|International {{airports}} sometimes serve {{military as}} well as commercial purposes and their viability is also affected by technological developments. Canton Island Airport, for example, in the Phoenix Islands (Kiribati), after serving as a <b>military</b> <b>airport</b> during World War II, {{was used as a}} refuelling stop by commercial aircraft such as Qantas which stationed ground crew there in the late 1950s. The advent in the early 1960s of jet aircraft such as the Boeing 707 with the range to fly non-stop between Australia or New Zealand and Hawaii, meant that a mid-Pacific stop was no longer needed and the airport was closed to regular commercial use. Other international airports, such as Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong, have been decommissioned and replaced when they reached capacity or technological advances rendered them inadequate.|$|E

40|$|Sources of {{information}} about noise environments {{at different times of}} the day at civilian and <b>military</b> <b>airports</b> are identified. Information about movements of scheduled flights are available in machine readable form from the Official Airline Guide. Information about permanent noise monitoring sites is readily obtained from individual airports. Limited data on the timing of flights are available at centralized locations for <b>military</b> <b>airports.</b> An examination of scheduled flights at commercial airports leads to the conclusion that differences between daytime and nighttime noise levels (measured in Equivalent Continuous Noise Level, LEQ) vary from 7 to 15 decibels. Data from 128 permanent noise monitoring sites at 11 airports are also examined. Differences between daytime and nighttime noise levels at these 128 noise monitoring sites vary from 3 to 17 decibels (LEQ). Preliminary analyses suggest that accurate estimates of time-of-day weights could not be obtained from conventional social surveys at existing airports...|$|R
