This seems due to a vaporisation of the spirit within the tube. I have seen a thermometer of this description in India, of which the spirit seemed to have retired wholly into the bulb, and which I was assured had never been injured. In wet-bulb observations, distilled water or rain, or snow water was used, but I never found the result to differ from that obtained by any running fresh water, except such as was polluted to the taste and eye.|$|E

DESIGN [...] Questionnaire survey of general practices {{and child health}} clinics, and monitoring of storage temperatures of selected refrigerators. SETTING [...] Central Manchester and Bradford health districts. SUBJECTS [...] 45 general practices and five child health clinics, of which 40 (80 %) responded. Eight practices were selected for refrigeration monitoring. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Adherence to Department of Health guidelines for vaccine storage, temperature range to which vaccines were exposed over two weeks. RESULTS [...] Of the 40 respondents, only 16 {{were aware of the}} appropriate storage conditions for the vaccines; eight had minimum and <b>maximum</b> <b>thermometers</b> but only one of these was monitored daily. In six of the eight practices selected for monitoring of refrigeration temperatures the vaccines were exposed to either subzero temperatures (three fridges) or temperatures up to 16 degrees C (three). Two of these were specialised drug storage refrigerators with an incorporated thermostat and external temperature gauges. CONCLUSION [...] Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines.

50|$|The {{traditional}} thermometer is a {{glass tube}} with a bulb {{at one end}} containing a liquid which expands {{in a uniform manner}} with temperature.

50|$|A {{special kind}} of mercury-in-glass thermometer, called a <b>maximum</b> <b>thermometer,</b> works by having a {{constriction}} in the neck close to the bulb.

When the temperature falls, the column of mercury breaks at the constriction and cannot return to the bulb, thus remaining stationary in the tube. The observer can then read the maximum temperature over the set period of time. To reset the thermometer it must be swung sharply. This design is used in the traditional type of medical thermometer.|$|E

40|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} previous long-term temperature studies {{has been the}} appearance of warming since the 1880 s, this often being taken as evidence for anthropogenic-induced global warming. In this investigation, the long-term, annual, mean temperature record (1844 - 1992) of the Armagh Observatory (Armagh, North Ireland), a set of temperature data based on <b>maximum</b> and minimum <b>thermometers</b> that predates the 1880 s and correlates well with northern hemispheric and global standards, is examined for evidence of systematic variation, in particular, as related to solar-cycle forcing and secular variation. Indeed, both appear to be embedded within the Armagh data. Removal of these effects, each contributing about 8 % to the overall reduction in variance, yields residuals that are randomly distributed. Application of the 10 -year moving average to the residuals, furthermore, strongly suggests that {{the behavior of the}} residuals is episodic, inferring that (for extended periods of time) temperatures at Armagh sometimes were warmer or cooler (than expected), while at other times they were stable. Comparison of cyclic averages of annual mean temperatures against the lengths of the associated Hale cycles (i. e., the length of two, sequentially numbered, even-odd sunspot cycle pairs) strongly suggests that the temperatures correlate inversely (r = - 0. 886 at less than 2 % level of significance) against the length of the associated Hale cycle. Because sunspot cycle 22 ended in 1996, the present Hale cycle probably will be shorter than average, implying that temperatures at Armagh over this Hale cycle will be warmer (about 9. 31 q 0. 23 C at the 90 % confidence level) than average (= 9. 00 C) ...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{find out}} the {{influence}} {{of different types of}} roofing materials on micro-climate in animal loose housing system during rainy season. Materials and Methods: Different shade materials were used for covered area under each of three treatments. Thatch shading roof (T 1), Agro-net shading roof (T 2), Asbestos with canvas shading roof (T 3). Long axis of the paddock was east-to-west orientation. The covered area floor space was 1. 5 × 1 m (excluding manger) for each animal and open paddock was 2 × 1 m. Height of shed at eaves was 2 meter. Daily temperature (maximum and minimum) and dry bulb and wet bulb temperature of macro and micro- environment under different treatments were recorded at 9 : 30 AM and 2 : 00 PM of Indian Standard Time (IST) by using <b>maximum</b> and minimum <b>thermometer</b> and dry and wet bulb thermometer. Both inside and outside surface temperatures of shade materials were measured by infrared digital thermometer (ebro, TFI 220). The statistical procedures followed were two way ANOVA and Paired 'T' test. Results: During the experimental period, maximum temperature was recorded under asbestos and lowest temperature was in agro-net and maximum protection from high temperature was given during peak hot hours in agro-net than asbestos. THI was more (P< 0. 05) under asbestos than agro-net and thatch. The outside surface temperature at 9. 30 AM and 2 : 00 PM (IST) was significantly lower (P< 0. 05) in agro-net than thatch and asbestos.

The nutrient status of the seedlings growing in association with snowbrush and in the open was also determined on the six clear cuts. Needles on the current year's growth were analyzed at three times during the year, for nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, potassium and phosphorus. The nutrient levels of the seedlings were then related to their position relative to snowbrush. The percent total nitrogen and the exchangeable calcium, magnesium and potassium in the soil under snowbrush and in the open were analyzed. Three of the six clear cuts were selected and soil moisture in the open, along the edge and under snowbrush was measured with Colman fiberglas moisture blocks and gravimetrically, In all, 33 moisture stations were used.

The greenhouse had the following dimensions 4. 5 m height, 3 m pier, 60 m length, and 5 m wide. The greenhouse was divided into two equal parts, forming two atmospheres with 30 m length each. One of the rooms was covered with polyethylene with low density, 100 micras of denseness and the other room, under this covering, it was installed to the height of the foot-righ, the reflective screen 50 %. Inside each room three small evaporimeter were established to 0. 4 m height, and a meteorological protection at 1. 5 m height, containing Piche evaporimeter, <b>maximum</b> and minimum <b>thermometer</b> and Dattalogger. In order to evaluate the productive characteristics of the cultivate, treatments distributions followed the randomized design (DCA), with 6 replications.
