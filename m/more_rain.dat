50|$|The {{north-eastern}} {{states of}} India saw heavy rainfalls in July 2016. The state of Assam faced around 60% <b>more</b> <b>rains</b> than it received in July 2015. The rainfall resulted in flooding of various rivers and on 5 July the Brahmaputra River had crossed its danger mark {{level in the}} seven districts of Lakhimpur, Dhemaji, Nagaon, Jorhat, Golaghat, Morigaon and Biswanath.|$|R
30|$|The pre-monsoon {{rainfall}} {{is almost}} uniform throughout the district. The coastal regions get <b>more</b> <b>rains</b> {{rather than the}} interior regions. This district is mainly depending on the seasonal rains, and the distress conditions prevail {{in the event of}} the failure of rains. Northeast and southwest monsoons are the major donors with 54 % and 36 % contribution each to the total annual rainfall. During normal monsoon, the district receives a rainfall of 1213.3  mm (Table  1).|$|R

5|$|Nico Rosberg {{topped the}} {{timesheets}} on Friday, {{ahead of the}} two Red Bull cars of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. The session started on a very wet track, but with no <b>more</b> <b>rain</b> falling, it dried out as the practice progressed, with drivers soon switching to intermediate tyres. Lewis Hamilton was fifth fastest, behind Carlos Sainz Jr.. Despite going off the track late in the session, Fernando Alonso was ninth fastest in the McLaren with the new power unit. A gearbox problem meant that Pastor Maldonado was unable {{to take to the}} track, while at Sauber, Raffaele Marciello replaced Felipe Nasr, ending the session three-tenths of a second quicker than teammate Marcus Ericsson.|$|E
5|$|The {{municipal}} corporation of Madurai has {{an area of}} 147.97km2. Madurai is hot and dry for eight months of the year. Cold winds are experienced during February and March as in the neighbouring Dindigul. The hottest months are from March to July. The city experiences a moderate climate from August to October, tempered by heavy rain and thundershowers, and a slightly cooler climate from November to February. Fog and dew are rare, occurring only during the winter season. Being equidistant from mountains and the sea, it experiences similar monsoon pattern with Northeast monsoon and Southwest monsoon, with the former providing <b>more</b> <b>rain</b> during October to December. The average annual rainfall for the Madurai district is about 85.76cm.|$|E
5|$|As weather {{conditions}} shift due to climate change, bees change their behaviors. When it rains, bees {{do not go}} out and during extremely hot weather they try to gather water to keep the colony cool. Climatologists have predicted that the occurrence of extreme weather events (such as intense rainy seasons and prolonged drought) will increase as the climate continues to change. Additionally, in regions that experience increasingly <b>more</b> <b>rain,</b> pollen will be washed away more easily {{making it more difficult}} for bees to provide for their colonies. Meanwhile, in environments experiencing prolonged drought, flower environments may dwindle with dry weather. These patterns lead to less suitable and viable environments in which bees can thrive. A British journal published projections of plant diversity loss against spatial sensitivity; the researchers found major species loss {{in the southern part of}} the UK forcing bee colonies further north.|$|E
50|$|Significant {{flooding}} {{occurred in}} late 2011 in Thailand's southern provinces. Nine provinces were being affected by flash flooding owing to rains {{that occurred in}} November 2011. Saba Yoi, Khuan Niang, Rattaphum, and Singha Nakhon districts were declared disaster zones after flood waters as deep as five meters covered nearly all areas. More than 159 small and key roads were impassable. Ten other districts were feared at risk of inundation and <b>more</b> <b>rains</b> were expected. Coastal areas in the south were also battered by high waves.|$|R
50|$|The {{climate of}} Lowell differs {{slightly}} {{from that of}} Eugene, which is at lower elevation. Lowell receives 8 in <b>more</b> of <b>rain</b> and 2 in more of snow per year than Eugene. In central Lane County, that two inches is significant considering the lack of snow. The higher areas of the town receive <b>more</b> snow and <b>rain</b> as well. Wedged among three reservoirs, it experiences thick winter fog.|$|R
30|$|In summary, all {{deviations}} from today’s values will increase with passing time, fostering a local development towards a <b>more</b> winter <b>rain</b> climate that features increasingly hot and dry summers and mild wet winters.|$|R
5|$|In {{southern}} Palestine the wet {{season was}} approaching with another thunderstorm and heavy {{rain on the}} night of 11 November. The dark cotton soil over which the Egyptian Expeditionary Force was now advancing would not need much <b>more</b> <b>rain</b> to turn it into impassable mud. But 12 November had been fine and the roads had dried out. The rolling maritime plain was dotted with villages on low hill tops surrounded by groves and orchards. These were in turn surrounded by hedges of prickly pear or cactus, making them strong natural places of defence. In the distance to the right the spurs and valleys of the Judean Hills were visible even to the invading British Empire troops near the Mediterranean coast. On 13 November the weather was clear and fine with at first no sign of the Ottoman Army.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{behaviour}} of the dodo, as most contemporary descriptions are very brief. Based on weight estimates, {{it has been suggested}} the male could reach the age of 21, and the female 17. Studies of the cantilever strength of its leg bones indicate that it could run quite fast. Unlike the Rodrigues solitaire, {{there is no evidence that}} the dodo used its wings in intraspecific combat. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison. The dodo may instead have used its large, hooked beak in territorial disputes. Since Mauritius received <b>more</b> <b>rain</b> and had a more stable climate than Rodrigues, there was probably less need for male dodos to fight over territory. The solitaire was therefore probably the more aggressive of the two.|$|E
5|$|Olaf {{was a part}} of a {{rainy year}} in Mexico, {{producing}} <b>more</b> <b>rain</b> than Hurricane Nora. Although no deaths were reported, flooding caused serve damage to roadways and crops in the Mexican state of Jalisco. In the same state, more than 12,000 homes were damaged. In the state of Guanajuato, an estimated total of 15,000 people were impacted from the floods. In addition, two communities were isolated. After the hurricane, a program wanted donation from food to basic home supplies. Moisture from the remnants of Nora and Olaf interacted with an upper-level low to produce heavy rainfall across Texas, producing flooding near Waco that forced a family to evacuate in McGregor. The floodwaters closed portions of Interstate 35, U.S. Route 84, and Texas State Highway 36. It also spawned a tornado in Sugar Land that damaged four buildings, including a school.|$|E

5|$|The winter {{affected}} {{many other}} European countries. Similar cold periods and snowfalls {{were seen in}} much of Central Europe and the southern Baltic region. De Bilt, near Amsterdam in the Netherlands, experienced its worst winter since 1790. Because of the anticyclone {{to the north of}} the United Kingdom several incoming Atlantic depressions which would normally have hit Britain were forced south to the Mediterranean region, resulting in Portugal, Spain and Southern France having <b>more</b> <b>rain</b> than usual while remaining relatively warm. For example, the February rainfall at Gibraltar was , three times the average. As a result, France experienced both the extreme cold in the north, and much rain in the south. The winter caused 150 deaths from the cold and lack of food in Berlin, which was still recovering from its devastation during the final stages of the Second World War. It forced schools in the Netherlands to shut, led to a mob attack on a goods train carrying coal in Copenhagen, and caused the closure of businesses and the restriction of domestic gas supplies in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Magnussen made {{a second}} pit {{stop at the}} end of lap 16 for a {{steering-wheel}} change. On lap 17 Ricciardo went to the outside of Massa on the S-curves and moved inside, passing Massa to move into sixth. Rosberg was informed by team radio that <b>more</b> <b>rain</b> was expected within eight minutes. Vettel overtook Bottas around the outside for fourth place on the next lap. Bottas fell to fifth on the 19th lap, when Ricciardo passed him around the outside on the S-curves. Vettel began to reduce the time deficit to third-place Button, and Ricciardo was driving at a speed similar to his teammate. Bottas was caught by his Williams teammate Massa, who pulled away from Hülkenberg (who went off the track at the second turn). Both Red Bull drivers were the fastest by lap 21, but were 13 seconds behind Button and a further five seconds behind Rosberg (who, despite running off the track at 130R corner, had a shrinking one-second advantage over Hamilton). A dry line began to emerge by this time as some drivers drove through standing water to keep their tyre temperatures down.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAiming {{to study}} the {{evolutionary}} trend of the annual autumn germination in Gurbantunggut Desert with <b>more</b> <b>rains,</b> the model of autumn germination ratio was established {{on the basis of}} the investigation by Valleriani and others. Altogether the paper presents four findings: (1) As for the different species, the bigger the ratio of plant yield between autumn germination and spring germination is, the lower the germination rate of evolutionary stability is; (2) The germination rate of evolutionary stability would increase given that the climate was pleasant for autumn germination. (3) The lower the dormancy survival rate of the species is, the higher the germination rate of evolutionary stability is; (4) As for the same species, the smaller the ratio of prospective yield between autumn germination and spring germination is, the lower the germination rate of evolutionary stability is; on the contrary, the germination rate of evolutionary stability would increase. After analyzing the tendency of the germination rate of evolutionary stability taking into account of the climate change, it turned out in the model that the less rains in spring, the lower the germination rate of evolutionary stability is and that <b>more</b> <b>rains</b> in autumn, less in spring as well as way too cold weather in winter all contribute to the seeds’ autumn germination. In conclusion, combined with the model and the fruit types of autumn germination it is speculated that the annual with large quantity of plants, seeds plus lower dormancy survival rate would be easier to germinate on condition of climate change. Therefore, this paper supplies reference to the features as well as evolutionary trend of plants in arid desert in terms of global climate change...|$|R
