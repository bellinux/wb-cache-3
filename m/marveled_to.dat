2500|$|Brando's {{performance}} was glowingly reviewed by critics. [...] "I {{thought it would}} be interesting to play a gangster, maybe for the first time in the movies, who wasn't like those bad guys Edward G. Robinson played, but who is kind of a hero, a man to be respected," [...] Brando recalled in his autobiography. [...] "Also, because he had so much power and unquestioned authority, I {{thought it would be}} an interesting contrast to play him as a gentle man, unlike Al Capone, who beat up people with baseball bats." [...] Duvall later <b>marveled</b> <b>to</b> A's Biography, [...] "He minimized the sense of beginning. In other words he, like, deemphasized the word action. He would go in front of that camera just like he was before. Cut! It was all the same. There was really no beginning. I learned a lot from watching that." [...] Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, but he declined it, becoming the second actor to refuse a Best Actor award (after George C. Scott for Patton). He boycotted the award ceremony, instead sending American Indian rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather, who appeared in full Apache attire, to state Brando's reasons, which were based on his objection to the depiction of American Indians by Hollywood and television.|$|E

60|$|As {{they left}} the admiral's cabin, Ned invited his three friends to dine on board his ship, the Sovereign; and a right merry {{gathering}} it was, as they talked over their past adventures, and <b>marveled</b> <b>to</b> find themselves each commanding a ship, about to attack the fleet of Spain in its own harbor.|$|E
500|$|In 1954, the East Germans {{resumed their}} {{attempts}} at recognition. The following year, after Brundage received assurances that the East German NOC was not government-run, the IOC voted to recognize it, but required that both East and West Germany compete {{as part of}} a single German team in 1956. East Germany sent only 37 athletes to the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, and they lived and trained separately from their West German counterparts. For the Summer Olympics at Rome in 1960, under continuing IOC insistence that the two states send a single team, East Germany contributed 141 of the 321 athletes; competitors from both states lived in the same area of the Olympic Village. At the Opening Ceremony at Rome, Italian President Giovanni Gronchi <b>marveled,</b> much <b>to</b> Brundage's delight, that the IOC had obtained the German reunification which politicians had been unable to secure; Brundage responded, [...] "But in sport, we do such things." [...] Brundage saw the German participation as symbolic of the potential for the Olympic Games to overcome divisions to unite.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{was in a}} wild country, {{and very}} far away; but in time I came to the camp, hidden between the mountains, where men worked night and day, out of {{the sight of the}} sun. Yet the time was not come. I listened to the talk of the people. He had gone away--they had gone away--to England, it was said, in the matter of {{bringing}} men with much money together to form companies. I saw the house they had lived in; more like a palace, such as one sees in the old countries. In the nighttime I crept in through a window that I might see in what manner he treated her. I went from room to room, and in such way thought kings and queens must live, it was all so very good. And they all said he treated her like a queen, and many <b>marveled</b> as <b>to</b> what breed of woman she was for there was other blood in her veins, and she was different from the women of Akatan, and no one knew her for what she was. Aye, she was a queen; but I was a chief, and the son of a chief, and I had paid for her an untold price of skin and boat and bead.|$|R
2500|$|The New Yorker and Politico placed Think Big and Kick Ass {{within the}} genre of {{self-help}} books. The Economist and Bookseller + Publisher Magazine said {{it was part of}} a trend of business books. The Economics noted that during successful periods of the stock market more finance books were published. Author and academic John Lubans wrote about the business genre, [...] "And there’s a subset of the business fad industry: books. Not about a system of work, but titles written by celebrity leaders like Donald Trump, Jack Welch, and others bent on explaining how they got to be as good as they decidedly are and how you too, if you follow their advice, can make it to the top. Mr. Trump’s latest, Think Big and Kick Ass, probably defines the genre." [...] Jeffrey L. Buller wrote in Change Leadership in Higher Education that the book was part of [...] "a school of thought that says when it comes to success in life or at work, leadership requires people to become aggressive, assertive, and at times even abusive in order to achieve their goals. The Daily Beast <b>marveled</b> that subsequent <b>to</b> Trump's inauguration, the work joined the pantheon of presidential memoirs.|$|R
60|$|To my {{surprise}} I soon found {{myself on the}} floor of a shallow wind cave. The lion trail led straight across it and on. Shelves of rock stuck out above under which I hurriedly walked. I came upon a shrub cedar growing in a niche and <b>marveled</b> <b>to</b> see it there. Don went slower and slower.|$|E
6000|$|He woke refreshed, happy, {{and eager}} for his cablegram. He {{had been born}} an aristocrat, {{he had been a}} democrat for a time, he was now an aristocrat again. He <b>marveled</b> <b>to</b> find that this final change was not merely intellectual, it had invaded his feeling; and he also <b>marveled</b> <b>to</b> note that this feeling seemed a good deal less {{artificial}} than any he had entertained in his system for a long time. He could also have noted, if he had thought of it, that his bearing had stiffened, over night, and that his chin had lifted itself a shade. Arrived in the basement, he was about to enter the breakfast room when he saw old Marsh {{in the dim light of}} a corner of the hall, beckoning him with his finger to approach. The blood welled slowly up in Tracy's cheek, and he said with a grade of injured dignity almost ducal: ...|$|E
60|$|The unfortunate Abderahman had halted for a {{few days}} to repose himself among a horde of Bedouins, who had {{received}} him with their characteristic hospitality. They would gather round him in the evenings, to listen to his conversation, regarding with wonder this gently-spoken stranger from the more refined country of Egypt. The old men <b>marveled</b> <b>to</b> find so much knowledge and wisdom in such early youth, and the young men, won by his frank and manly carriage, entreated him to remain among them.|$|E
6000|$|... crooned Namgay Doola {{again and}} again, and I racked my brain for that lost tune. It was not till after dinner that I {{discovered}} some one had cut {{a square foot}} of velvet from the centre of my best camera-cloth. This made me so angry that I wandered down the valley {{in the hope of}} meeting the big brown bear. I could hear him grunting like a discontented pig in the poppy field as I waited shoulder deep in the dew-dripping Indian corn to catch him after his meal. The moon was at full and drew out the scent of the tasseled crop. Then I heard the anguished bellow of a Himalayan cow--one of the little black crummies no bigger than Newfoundland dogs. Two shadows that looked like a bear and her cub hurried past me. I was in the act of firing when I saw that each bore a brilliant red head. The lesser animal was trailing something rope-like that left a dark track on the path. They were within six feet of me, and the shadow of the moonlight lay velvet-black on their faces. Velvet-black was exactly the word, for by all the powers of moonlight they were masked in the velvet of my camera-cloth. I <b>marveled,</b> and went <b>to</b> bed.|$|R
6000|$|The {{performance}} {{came to an}} end, {{the illusion}} dying out first here and then there, as some rose to put on their coats, others stood upright to salute [...] "God Save the King," [...] the musicians folded their music and encased their instruments, and the lights sank one by one until the house was empty, silent, and full of great shadows. Looking {{back over her shoulder}} as she followed Ralph through the swing doors, Cassandra <b>marveled</b> <b>to</b> see how the stage was already entirely without romance. But, she wondered, did they really cover all the seats in brown holland every night? ...|$|E
6000|$|As he rode back to {{the hotel}} Babbitt reflected, [...] "Myra would have enjoyed all this social agony." [...] For himself he cared less for the garden party than for the motor tours which the Monarch Chamber of Commerce had arranged. Indefatigably he viewed water-reservoirs, {{suburban}} trolley-stations, and tanneries. He devoured the statistics which were given to him, and <b>marveled</b> <b>to</b> his roommate, W. A. Rogers, [...] "Of course this town isn't a patch on Zenith; it hasn't got our outlook and natural resources; but did you know--I nev' did till to-day--that they manufactured seven hundred and sixty-three million feet of lumber last year? What d' you think of that!" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{asked him}} several questions: how lately {{he had seen}} Mrs. Tristram, how long {{he had been in}} Paris, how long he {{expected}} to remain there, how he liked it. She spoke English without an accent, or rather with that distinctively British accent which, on his arrival in Europe, had struck Newman as an altogether foreign tongue, but which, in women, he had come to like extremely. Here and there Madame de Cintre's utterance had a faint shade of strangeness {{but at the end of}} ten minutes Newman found himself waiting for these soft roughnesses. He enjoyed them, and he <b>marveled</b> <b>to</b> see that gross thing, error, brought down to so fine a point.|$|E
60|$|Behind every {{rock and}} cedar she {{expected}} to find Jim. Surely he had only threatened her. But she had taunted {{him in a way}} no man could stand, and if there were any strength of character in him he would show it now. Her remorse and dread increased. After all, he was only a boy--only a couple of years older than she was. Under stress of feeling he might go to any extreme. Had she misjudged him? If she had not, she had at least been brutal. But he had dared to kiss her! Every time she thought of that a tingling, a confusion, a hot shame went over her. And at length Joan <b>marveled</b> <b>to</b> find that out of the affront to her pride, and the quarrel, and the fact of his going and of her following, and especially out of this increasing remorseful dread, there had flourished up a strange and reluctant respect for Jim Cleve.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes, as {{a reward}} of goodness, {{we were allowed to}} visit her in her own room, a neat little parlor in the neighborhood, whose windows looked down a {{hillside}} on one hand, under the boughs of an apple-orchard, where daisies and clover and bobolinks always abounded in summer time; and on the other faced the street, with a green yard flanked by one or two shady elms between them and the street. No nun's cell was ever neater, no bee's cell ever more compactly and carefully arranged; and to us, familiar with the confusion of a great family of little ones, there was always something inviting about its stillness, its perfect order, and the air of thoughtful repose that breathed over it. She lived there in perfect independence, doing, as it was her delight to do, every office of life for herself. She was her own cook, her own parlor and chamber maid, her own laundress; and very faultless the cooking, washing, ironing, and care of her premises were. A slice of Aunt Esther's gingerbread, one of Aunt Esther's cookies, had, we all believed, certain magical properties such as belonged to no other mortal mixture. Even a handful of walnuts that were brought from the depths of her mysterious closet had virtues in our eyes such as no other walnuts could approach. The little shelf of books that hung suspended by cords against her wall was sacred in our regard; the volumes were like no other books; and we supposed that she derived from them those stores of knowledge on all subjects which she unconsciously dispensed among us,--for she was always telling us something of metals, or minerals, or gems, or plants, or animals, which awakened our curiosity, stimulated our inquiries, and, above all, led us to wonder where she had learned it all. Even the slight restrictions which her neat habits imposed on our breezy and turbulent natures seemed all quite graceful and becoming. It was right, in our eyes, to cleanse our shoes on scraper and mat with extra diligence, and then to place a couple of chips under the heels of our boots when we essayed to dry our feet at her spotless hearth. We <b>marveled</b> <b>to</b> see our own faces reflected in a thousand smiles and winks from her bright brass andirons,--such andirons we thought were seen on earth in no other place,--and a pair of radiant brass candlesticks, that illustrated the mantelpiece, were viewed with no less respect.|$|E
6000|$|Mary {{shut the}} door, laid the {{documents}} upon her table, and sank {{her head on}} her hands. Her brain was curiously empty of any thought. She listened, as if, perhaps, by listening she would become merged again in {{the atmosphere of the}} office. From the next room came the rapid spasmodic sounds of Mrs. Seal's erratic typewriting; she, doubtless, was already hard at work helping the people of England, as Mr. Clacton put it, to think rightly; [...] "generating and stimulating," [...] those were his words. She was striking a blow against the enemy, no doubt, who didn't let the grass grow beneath their feet. Mr. Clacton's words repeated themselves accurately in her brain. She pushed the papers wearily over to the farther side of the table. It was no use, though; something or other had happened to her brain--a change of focus so that near things were indistinct again. The same thing had happened to her once before, she remembered, after she had met Ralph in the gardens of Lincoln's Inn Fields; she had spent the whole of a committee meeting in thinking about sparrows and colors, until, almost {{at the end of the}} meeting, her old convictions had all come back to her. But they had only come back, she thought with scorn at her feebleness, because she wanted to use them to fight against Ralph. They weren't, rightly speaking, convictions at all. She could not see the world divided into separate compartments of good people and bad people, any more than she could believe so implicitly in the rightness of her own thought as to wish to bring the population of the British Isles into agreement with it. She looked at the lemon-colored leaflet, and thought almost enviously of the faith which could find comfort in the issue of such documents; for herself she would be content to remain silent for ever if a share of personal happiness were granted her. She read Mr. Clacton's statement with a curious division of judgment, noting its weak and pompous verbosity on the one hand, and, at the same time, feeling that faith, faith in an illusion, perhaps, but, at any rate, faith in something, was of all gifts the most to be envied. An illusion it was, no doubt. She looked curiously round her at the furniture of the office, at the machinery in which she had taken so much pride, and <b>marveled</b> <b>to</b> think that once the copying-presses, the card-index, the files of documents, had all been shrouded, wrapped in some mist which gave them a unity and a general dignity and purpose independently of their separate significance. The ugly cumbersomeness of the furniture alone impressed her now. Her attitude had become very lax and despondent when the typewriter stopped in the next room. Mary immediately drew up to the table, laid hands on an unopened envelope, and adopted an expression which might hide her state of mind from Mrs. Seal. Some instinct of decency required that she should not allow Mrs. Seal to see her face. Shading her eyes with her fingers, she watched Mrs. Seal pull out one drawer after another in her search for some envelope or leaflet. She was tempted to drop her fingers and exclaim: ...|$|E

Wilkenfeld also headlined her own shows scheduled on days between The Who concerts starting in Toronto, Ontario on 29 February 2016. When Jeff Beck was interviewed about Wilkenfeld's transition to solo artist, he said “She’s quite an incredible musician, isn’t she?” Jeff Beck <b>marveled</b> <b>to</b> Digital Trends {{after a recent}} private listening session in New York. “She can sing, write songs, and play guitar too.

5000|$|Biographer Anthony Reynolds {{writes in}} the 2010 book Leonard Cohen: A Remarkable Life that friend and fellow Canadian {{songwriter}} Joni Mitchell tried to warn Cohen about working with Spector, the songstress having witnessed some of the insanity between Spector and Lennon in L.A., but initially - {{at least at the}} songwriting stage - the pair worked well together. Songwriter John Prine, who had also witnessed the producer's bizarre antics when he had been invited to his house to compose a song together, later <b>marveled</b> <b>to</b> Paul Zollo of BluebirdRailroad magazine that as soon as Spector [...] "sat down with an instrument, he was normal." [...] Things would change once Cohen and Spector entered a studio, with the producer's paranoia taking over and Cohen becoming increasingly disengaged from the project.|$|E

5000|$|The Late Great Townes Van Zandt was {{released}} in 1972 and has since made several critical [...] "best of all-time" [...] lists. Stereophile included {{it as one of}} 94 honorable mentions that just missed their list of [...] "The 40 Essential Albums". [...] AllMusic states, [...] "This is the second perfect album Van Zandt cut in 1972, a complement to High, Low and In Between. Together they contain the highest points of his brilliant but erratic career. The Late Great may be a bit stronger, with classics like 'Pancho & Lefty', 'No Lonesome Tune', and 'If I Needed You', but there's not a weak track here." [...] Amazon.com calls it [...] "Van Zandt's perfect storm" [...] and declares, [...] "The Late Great, Townes Van Zandt might be his masterwork...a release that should be in every collection of great American music." [...] John Kruth writes in To Live's To Fly that former Warner Brothers publicist Bill Bently gave Elvis Costello a cassette of Van Zandt songs to play as the punk rocker learned how to drive and Costello [...] "was so moved by 'Sad Cinderella' that he was said to have curbed the car and could only listen in awe" [...] while Jack Clement <b>marveled</b> <b>to</b> Kruth that [...] "Silver Ships of Andilar was [...] "more like a movie than a song."

[...] "If I Needed You" [...] has been recorded by Tom Astor, Ray Benson, Bonnie Bishop, Ginger Boatwright, Phil Cody, Dashboard Confessional, the Dead Ringer Band, Richard Dobson, Fireside, Enzo Garcia and Rhonda Harris. Emmylou Harris recorded the song as a duet with Don Williams and later with Van Zandt himself. [...] "Pancho and Lefty" [...] has been recorded by Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard, Emmylou Harris, Sally Barker, Johnny Bush, Pete Charles, the Cumberland Trio, Richard Dobson, Steve Earle, Cleve Francis, Dick Gaughan, Hawke, and Hoyt Axton. The Axton recording meant a lot to Van Zandt, who later recalled in an interview in Omaha Rainbow, [...] "I learnt to finger pick from one of Hoyt Axton's records...He's always been a favorite of mine. I played with him a couple of years ago. It really blew my mind when he recorded 'Pancho and Lefty.'" [...] "No Lonesome Tune" [...] has been recorded by David Bavas, Saul Broudy, Guy Clark, Mark Dvorak and Jimmie Dale Gilmore.
