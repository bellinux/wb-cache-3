40|$|Thesis (MTech (Public Management)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2016. There {{is always}} much {{debate about the}} {{performance}} of high schools, especially around the lack of learners excelling and the Grade 12 poor pass rate. This dissertation nvestigates the impact of mentorship {{on the performance of}} principals, deputy principals and subject heads at a selection of high schools in the Cape Town metropolitan area. Literature on the topic indicates that various types of <b>mentorship</b> <b>programmes</b> exist. The literature review consisted of journal articles, books and policy documents. For the purpose of the empirical study, the research question of whether mentorship has a positive impact on the performance of senior personnel in high schools was best answered by following a quantitative approach to research. The study population comprised 42 senior staff members from three high schools in the Cape Town metropolitan area. A questionnaire survey was used to collect data from the sample of 21 senior staff members, and the data analysis was done by means of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet using pie charts to illustrate the results. The study found that mentoring subordinate educators and principals is a Key Performance Area (KPA) of the convenience randomly selected schools that fall within the respective district {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Western Cape Education Department (WCED), that key personnel are familiar with mentorship, but that there are some issues that need to be resolved. It is envisaged that the implementation of <b>mentorship</b> <b>programmes</b> at high schools will positively influence the development of educators, and impact positively on the performance of key personnel and the performance of the affected schools...|$|R

A literature study was conducted on these two aspects. This was followed by a survey involving 67 educators from three geographically divergent secondary schools in Kwa-Zulu Natal, namely an urban, rural and peri-urban school. The respondents’ views indicate flaws in the current system related to: the minimum requirements for principalship, the shortlisting and interview processes and the role of bias in the selection of candidates. Respondents also believed that insufficient attention was paid to induction and <b>mentorship</b> <b>programmes.</b> The before mentioned impacted negatively on the school’s functionality regarding quality assurance, inter-personal relations, decision-making, parental involvement and learner discipline. These relate to low educator morale. The findings of the study indicate that the current system of educator promotions needs to revised so as to improve best practice in the profession...|$|R
40|$|Markets {{with high}} {{purchasing}} power, like export markets, offer opportunities for African smallholder farmers {{to move out}} of poverty. Logically, production for such higher value markets requires a different set of farm resources than the basic factors of production like land and labour. Yet it is not clear which other resources smallholder producers require to participate in different markets including high value markets. Using case studies from the Western Cape Province of South Africa, the authors identify resources that smallholder producers in developing countries require to increase competitiveness and sustain participation in high value markets. An analysis of the cases suggests that smallholder producers who are either in strategic partnerships or <b>mentorship</b> <b>programmes</b> with private sector firms are able to sustain their participation in high value markets. For smallholder producers who have not been integrated with high value markets yet, development of factor markets could be the first step towards achieving sustainable market access...|$|R
