5|$|In 1964 the US Army Area Handbook {{described}} the National Guard as 3,000 strong with a headquarters company, the Executive Mansion Guard Battalion in <b>Monrovia,</b> three infantry battalions and one engineer battalion (which was newly formed at Camp Naama in 1962 and {{only had one}} company organized). The three infantry battalions were the 1st Infantry Battalion, at Camp Schiefflin, situated on the airport road between <b>Monrovia</b> and Roberts International Airport, the 2nd Infantry Battalion, HQ at Barclay Training Center (BTC), <b>Monrovia,</b> and the 3rd Infantry Battalion, HQ at Baworobo, Maryland County.|$|E
5|$|By 1978, the LNG Brigade {{had been}} {{established}} and the Brigade was described as comprising a Headquarters and Headquarters Company at the Barclay Training Center, <b>Monrovia,</b> the Executive Mansion Guard Battalion on Capitol Hill, <b>Monrovia,</b> the Engineer Battalion and the First Field Artillery Battalion (both at Camp Jackson, Naama) two tactical combat battalions (the First Infantry Battalion, at Schiefflin and the Second Infantry Battalion which in the intervening period had moved from the BTC to Camp Tolbert, Todee) and three non-tactical battalions, tasked with providing guard services to government officials, tax collection, and 'other non-military duties'.|$|E
5|$|In August 1990 the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) {{despatched}} {{a peacekeeping}} force, ECOMOG, to Liberia. The force {{arrived at the}} Freeport of <b>Monrovia</b> on August 24, 1990, landing from Nigerian and Ghanaian vessels. By the time ECOMOG arrived, Prince Johnson's INPFL and Taylor's NPFL were fighting on the outside bounds of the port. A series of peacemaking conferences in regional capitals followed. There were meetings in Bamako in November 1990, Lome in January 1991, and Yamoussoukro in June–October 1991. The first seven peace conferences, including the Yamoussoukro I-IV processes and the Carter Center negotiation leading to the Cotonou Accords, failed {{due to lack of}} agreement between the warring factions. The NPFL launched an assault on <b>Monrovia</b> in 1992, which they named 'Operation Octopus.' The civil war lasted until the Abuja Accords of August 1996.|$|E

5|$|These {{mistakes}} allowed Doe {{the time}} to rally the Krahn-dominated Executive Mansion Guard and 1st Infantry Battalion from Camp Schiefflin to reestablished control. Quiwonkpa was captured, killed, and mutilated, his body being dismembered and parts eaten. In {{the aftermath of the}} attempted coup, purges took place in <b>Monrovia</b> and in Nimba County, Quiwonkpa's home, against those who had rejoiced after the coup announcement. As many as 1,500 people may have been killed. The AFL was purged of Gio soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{invitation}} of President William Tubman, Massaquoi returned to Liberia on 13 October 1946 to help him establish a university in <b>Monrovia.</b> She became Professor of French and Science in March 1947 at Liberia College, later the University of Liberia (UL). In 1956, she became director, then dean (1960), of the Liberal Arts College and was a co-founder of the Society of Liberian Authors. In 1962 Massaquoi founded and directed a programme for African Studies, which would evolve into the Institute of African Studies at UL.|$|E

5|$|Also in Arcadia, a Motel 6 {{was badly}} damaged. Other {{structural}} damage {{resulted from the}} shock. For example, both <b>Monrovia</b> and Pasadena each {{had more than a}} dozen buildings that were uninhabitable, {{but for the most part}} damage was limited to cracked plaster and broken windows. The Pasadena City Hall had moderate damage consisting of a cracked wall, dislodged marble barriers in the restrooms, and an offset dome. In Sierra Madre, four apartment buildings and nine homes were also tagged as uninhabitable. Of the more than 100 injuries that were reported in Arcadia, Pasadena, Glendale, and Sierra Madre, most were cuts, bruises, and sprains, but some serious injuries also occurred.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil War, all aircraft, equipment, materiel, and {{facilities}} belonging to the Liberian Air Force were badly damaged, rendering the force inoperable. During the Civil War the Taylor government made a variety of different air support arrangements; a seemingly inoperable Mil Mi-2 and Mil Mi-8, one in Anti-Terrorist Unit markings, could be seen at Spriggs Payne Airport in central <b>Monrovia</b> in mid-2005, apparently a hangover from the war. Meanwhile, during the Taylor era, the Navy consisted of a couple of small patrol craft. However, on shore, both late 1990s and 2005 sources indicate the Navy included the 2nd Naval District, Buchanan, the 3rd Naval District, Greenville, and the 4th Naval District, Harper.|$|E
5|$|By July 1990 the {{government}} began to distribute weapons to civilians in turn, to Krahn and Mandingo who wished to protect themselves. These hastily enlisted civilians became known as '1990 soldiers.' A '1990 soldier' which the President had personally picked, Tailey Yonbu, led a massacre of refugees, mostly Gio and Mandingo civilians, {{on the night of}} July 29/30, 1990 at St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Sinkor, <b>Monrovia.</b> Some 600 were killed. Because of the previous ethnic purges carried out by Doe's forces, the conflict took on characteristics of an ethnic pogrom.|$|E

5|$|From 1945 to 1964, the {{officers}} appointed were nearly all college graduates. From 1951, {{there was a}} US military mission based in Liberia to assist in training the AFL. A Reserve Officers' Training Corps was established in 1956 with units at the University of Liberia in <b>Monrovia</b> and the Booker Washington Institute in Kakata. By 1978 the program had been redesignated the Army Student Training Program (ASTP) and had a total of 46 students at the University of Liberia, the Booker Washington Institute, and three smaller institutions. However {{it was not until}} the late 1960s that the Tubman Military Academy was established in Todee District, upper Montserrado County, as an officer training facility.|$|E
5|$|Ohio is a lead {{producer}} of horticulture products, from greenhouse and nursery plants to bulbs. The {{state is a}} {{producer of}} white ash trees for landscaping, totalling 25,000 annually.

5|$|The revolt reached <b>Monrovia</b> by July 1990, and General Dubar {{left the}} country for exile in the United States.

Two Liberian Coast Guard vessels were sunk in the battles for the city. The NPFL had been distributing weapons to Gio civilians after it arrived in Nimba, where many were very interested in taking their revenge on the government after Doe had punished Nimba country for its support of Quiwonkpa in 1983 and 1985.|$|E
5|$|Three of the {{infantry}} units—the First Infantry Battalion, stationed at Camp Schieffelin, the Second Infantry Battalion at Camp Todee in northern Montserrado County, and the Sixth Infantry Battalion at Bomi Hills—were tactical elements designed to operate against hostile forces. The other battalions, the Third Infantry Battalion {{based at the}} Barclay Training Centre in <b>Monrovia,</b> the Fourth Infantry Battalion at Zwedru in Grand Gedeh County, and the Fifth Infantry Battalion at Gbarnga in Bong County served mostly as providers of personnel for non-military duties. Soldiers in these units were used extensively as policemen, customs and immigration officials, and as tax collectors.|$|E
5|$|Under Samuel Doe the Coast Guard was retitled the Liberian Navy in 1986 {{through the}} passage of The Liberian Navy Act of 1986. The Aviation Unit was founded in 1970 with the {{delivery}} of three Cessna U-17C light aircraft. An Aviation Unit aircraft crashed at Spriggs-Payne in 1984. In 1985 it operated three fixed-wing aircraft from Spriggs Payne Airport in <b>Monrovia,</b> including Cessna 172s. Their duties included reconnaissance and transport of light cargo and VIPs. The Aviation Unit was expanded in the 1980s with the delivery of more Cessna aircraft: three 172s, a 206, 207 and two single engined turboprop 208s.|$|E
40|$|The doctorfish Acanthurus chirurgus (Bloch, 1787) is {{reported}} {{for the first time}} from the central Mediterranean, based on a specimen caught in Maltese waters during August 2016. Since the only previous Mediterranean record of this species was based on a single individual observed in the Tyrrhenian Sea, the present record likely represents an independent introduction that may have occurred through the aquarium trade or via shipping. Two other surgeonfish species, Acanthurus coeruleus Bloch and Schneider, 1801 and Acanthurus <b>monroviae</b> Steindachner, 1876, were previously recorded from the central Mediterranean. While A. coeruleus may have established a population in the Levantine Sea, like A. chirurgus it has only been reported once from Malta (and from the central Mediterranean in general); both A. coeruleus and A. chirurgus are, therefore, considered to be casual species in Maltese waters. In contrast, A. <b>monroviae</b> was reported from several Mediterranean countries including Tunisia and Malta in the central Mediterranean. Here we present several authenticated reports of this species from Maltese waters, which strongly suggest that it has managed to establish a population in this region, although the possibility of multiple introductions cannot be excluded. peer-reviewe...|$|R
