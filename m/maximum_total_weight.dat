50|$|Manufacturers are {{required}} to calculate ACNs for new aircraft as they come into service and publish the results in flight manuals. The tables give ACN values for two weights, one at the <b>maximum</b> <b>total</b> <b>weight</b> authorized and the other at the operating weight when empty. If an aircraft is operating at an intermediate weight, the ACN value can be calculated by a linear variation between the limits. Extrapolation is not permissible. ACN is calculated {{with respect to the}} center of gravity position, which yields the critical loading on the critical gear. Normally, the aftmost center of gravity, or CG position, appropriate to the maximum gross apron (ramp) mass, or ramp weight, is used to calculate the ACN. In exceptional cases, the forwardmost CG position may make the nose-landing gear loading more critical.|$|E

As the entire body is legal target, there is no concept of an off-target touch, except if the fencer accidentally strikes the floor, setting off the light and tone on the scoring apparatus. Unlike foil and sabre, épée does not use [...] "right of way", and awards simultaneous touches to both fencers. However, if the score is tied in a match at the last point and a double touch is scored, the point is null and void.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{performance}} of the combustion process during medical waste incineration by studying physical properties of the ashes produced. Combustion characteristics data including <b>maximum</b> temperatures, <b>total</b> <b>weight</b> of waste loaded, weight of ashes, weight reduction, sieve analysis and particle size distribution were determined experimentally. The test runs were conducted in a newly installed incinerator at Temeke district hospital. The average maximum temperatures achieved in the primary chamber was 397. 8 ℃and 839 ℃ for secondary chamber with average incineration cycle time of 99 minutes. These temperatures were lower compared to the design temperatures of 650 ℃ and 950 ℃ as a result of loading wet waste. The ash samples were collected under the incinerator grate by randomly sampling the ashes for each run after weighing the total ash. The particle size distribution of ashes observed was not uniform due to presence of non-combustible materials in the sharps waste. However, the fineness modulus ranged between 2. 0 and 4. 0, which is in the acceptable range. From the above results it was concluded that, the incinerator performance was high in terms of the parameters assessed. To improve the incinerator performance further, it was recommended that the medical waste should be stored in a dry place away from rain...|$|R
