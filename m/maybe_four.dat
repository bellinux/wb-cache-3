Prost actually won the Italian Grand Prix, after Senna's engine blew with only 9 laps remaining. Until that point Prost's MP4/5 had not been a match for Senna's on Monza's long straights, which had many, especially those in the press, wondering if there was actually truth to Prost's claim that his Honda engines were not as good as the ones Senna was able to use.|$|E

While there he came to an agreement with Morpeth Harriers, a local running club, to begin training with them. Ser-Od trained on a running track {{for the first time}} at the Gateshead International Stadium and said that the area's 10km competitions were of particular benefit, given the rarity of races over that distance in East Asia. Reflecting on the change, he said: [...] "To train [...] you have to wear too many clothes, <b>maybe</b> <b>four</b> layers. Running is really hard then. In England it is different." [...] He ran in a series of British races from April to August, building towards the upcoming 2009 World Championships in Berlin.

A 10K best of 30:08 minutes came at Gateshead's Great North 10K, where he was seventh. The change of location resulted in a rise in the rankings in the World Championships Marathon in Berlin, as he finished in the top thirty for the first time, completing the course in 2:17:22 hours.

2500|$|There are {{commonly}} {{said to be}} three (or <b>maybe</b> <b>four)</b> small exceptions to the rule against enforcing non-charitable purpose trusts, and there is one certain and major loophole. First, trusts can be created for building and maintaining graves and funeral monuments. Second, trusts have been allowed for the saying of private masses. Third, it was (long before the Hunting Act 2004) said to lawful to have a trust promoting fox hunting. These [...] "exceptions" [...] {{were said to be}} fixed in Re Endacott, where a minor businessman in who lived in Devon wanted to entrust money [...] "for the purpose of providing some useful memorial to myself". Lord Evershed MR held this invalid because it was not a grave, let alone charitable. It has, however, been questioned whether the existing categories are in fact true exceptions given that graves and masses could be construed as trusts which ultimately benefit the landowner, or the relevant church. In any case the major exception to the no purpose trust rule is that in many other common law countries, particularly the United States and a number of Caribbean states, they can be valid. If capital is entrusted under the rules of other jurisdictions the Recognition of Trusts Act 1987 Schedule 1, articles 6 and 18 requires that the trusts are recognised. This follows the Hague Trust Convention of 1985, which was ratified by 12 countries. The UK recognises any offshore trusts unless they are [...] "manifestly incompatible with public policy". Even trusts in countries that are [...] "offshore financial centres" [...] (typically described as [...] "tax havens" [...] because wealthy individuals or corporations shift their assets there to avoid paying taxes in the UK), purpose trusts can be created which serve no charitable function, or any function related to the good of society, so long as the trust document specifies someone to be an [...] "enforcer" [...] of the trust document. These include Jersey, the Isle of Mann, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands. It is argued, for example by David Hayton, a former UK academic trust lawyer who was recruited to serve on the Caribbean Court of Justice, that having an enforcer resolves any problem of ensuring that the trust is run accountably. This substitutes for the oversight that beneficiaries would exercise. The result, it is argued, is that English law's continued prohibition on non-charitable purpose trusts is antiquated and ineffective, and is better removed so that money remains [...] "onshore". This would also have the consequence, like in the US or the tax haven jurisdictions, that public money would be used to enforce trusts over vast sums of wealth which might never do anything for a living person.|$|E
