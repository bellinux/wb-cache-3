40|$|Providing {{personal}} communication systems supporting full mobility require intelligent networks for tracking mobile users and facilitating outgoing and incoming calls over different physical and network environments. In realizing the intelligent network functionalities, databases {{play a major}} role. Currently proposed network architectures envision using the SS 7 -based signaling network for linking these DB's and also for interconnecting DB's with switches. If the network has to support ubiquitous, seamless mobile services, then it has to support additionally mobile application parts, viz., <b>mobile</b> <b>origination</b> calls, mobile destination calls, mobile location updates and inter-switch handovers. These functions will generate significant amount of data and require them to be transferred between databases (HLR, VLR) and switches (MSC's) very efficiently. In the future, the users (fixed or mobile) may use and communicate with sophisticated CPE's (e. g. multimedia, multipoint and multisession calls) which may require complex signaling functions. This will generate volumness service handling data and require efficient transfer of these message between databases and switches. Consequently, the network providers {{would be able to}} add new services and capabilities to their networks incrementally, quickly and cost-effectively...|$|E

Its immediate function is to operate as an interactive video classroom connected to the Iowa Communications NetWork (ION), providing an electronic link with Iowa veterinarians {{in any of the}} ION system 2 ̆ 7 s 427 classrooms throughout the state. Additionally, the system is intended to provide iIiteractive links using lSD 2 ̆ 7 s satellite uplink system, and eventually via computer network-based digital communications systems. The Veterinary Medicine facility became operational in July of 1996 as lSD 2 ̆ 7 s fourth ICN classroom. Currently, this classroom is unique among ICN facilities in its ability to be converted back to video production studio, and conventional videotape production has been continued between ICN commitments. Its design reflects the special needs of medical and biological subject matter, and the next phase of its development will be to build and operate a <b>mobile</b> cart-based <b>origination</b> system...|$|R
