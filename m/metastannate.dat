40|$|The {{features}} of coal chemical recovery cassiterite concentrate in molten salt system Na 2 Co 3 –NaNO 3   (1 : 0, 3) were studied. It is shown that cassiterite (SnO 2) {{in the salt}} melt (900 – 950 °C) proceeds in the form <b>metastannate</b> (Na 2 SnO 3) and reduced to the metal, mainly gas CO, with high speed and completeness (97 %). </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of CaSnO 3 (calcium <b>metastannate)</b> for its application as a capacitor component possessing small temperature coefficient of capacitance (TCC) in electrical systems, is examined via the ac small-signal measurements. The ac electrical data were acquired on these samples sintered at various combinations of temperature-time frames (1200 ±C·T · 1350 ±C; 24 h · t · 60 h) {{in the frequency}} range from 5 Hz to 13 MHz. The measurements were carried out over the temperature range 25 – 300 ±C. The electrical response was found to exhibit relaxation processes {{in more than one}} complex plane formalism in a simultaneous fashion. The resistance of the sintered samples was dominated by the grain boundaries. The capacitance showed almost linear behavior in this measurement temperature range. The resulting electrical behavior has been discussed with the evolved microstructure in the sintered bodies. C ° 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers 1...|$|E
40|$|The phonon {{spectrum}} of cubic cadmium <b>metastannate</b> and the crystal structures of its distorted phases were calculated from first principles within the density functional theory. It is {{shown that the}} phonon spectrum and the energy {{spectrum of}} distorted phases in α-CdSnO_ 3 are surprisingly similar to the corresponding spectra of CdTiO_ 3. The ground state of α-CdSnO_ 3 is the ferroelectric Pbn 2 _ 1 phase; the energy gain accompanying the phase transition from the nonpolar Pbnm phase to this phase is ∼ 30 meV and the spontaneous polarization in it is 0. 25 C/m^ 2. An analysis of the eigenvector of the ferroelectric mode in α-CdSnO_ 3 and calculations of the partial densities of states indicates that the ferroelectric instability in this crystal, which does not contain d transition elements, {{is associated with the}} formation of a covalent bonding between Cd and O atoms.

40|$|Alkaline-earth stannates {{having the}} general {{chemical}} formula MSnO 3 (MDCa, Sr and Ba) have been projected as potential electronic ceramics. In {{view of the}} information gaps in the reported research, a vigorous and systematic investigation on these exotic materials has been carried out. In this communication, the synthesis of CaSnO 3, SrSnO 3 and BaSnO 3 via sol-gel technique is reported. Infrared spectroscopy and X-ray analyses of various gel samples with different thermal history helped in identifying the reaction pathways and the stage where amorphous gel to crystalline phase transition occurred. Grains of submicron size with narrow size distribution and spherical morphology, were the most noticeable characteristics of sintered calcium <b>metastannate</b> derived by sol-gel method. In the case of barium analogue, a fascinating ‘sugar cube ’ structure (akin to that observed in solid-state reaction and the self-heat-sustained reaction derived samples) having improved density characteristics evolved at low sintering temperatures. This gradually transformed into a more familiar spherical granular motif with improved density characteristics as the sintering profiles were varied from 1200 –C/ 24 h to 1500 –C/ 2 h. This {{seems to be an}} inherent feature of this system, irrespective of the method of synthesis. C ° 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers 1...|$|E
