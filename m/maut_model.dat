The required models to support the improvement design of a complex system must include both preference models and system behavioral models. A <b>MAUT</b> <b>model</b> captures the decisions related to customers' preferences whereas a fuzzy representation is proposed to model the relationships between systems parameters and performances to capture operational constraints. This {{latter part of the}} improvement design is supported by a branch and bound algorithm to efficiently compute the most relevant actions to be performed...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a multi-phase approach for selecting {{a country in}} which to locate a global manufacturing facility. An influence diagram is used to frame the decision. A decision tree then analyzes uncertainties regarding cost and generates a risk profile. The risk profile becomes one of the measures in an <b>MAUT</b> <b>model</b> that incorporate a wide range of factors. This sequential approach of using the output from a decision tree as input to MAUT is demonstrated with an example involving an auto supplier locating a new plant in one of five countries. Three decision makers were interviewed to determine the weights and the shape of the individual utility curves. The paper identifies, clearly defines, and incorporates a variety of measures for which national data are readily available. This list is broader and less subjective when compared to other examples reported in the literature. Decision support systems Location Multicriteria Risk...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the current}} {{industrial}} context, strategies intended {{to bring about}} continuous improvement have to include the multi-criteria performance expression aspects. A <b>MAUT</b> <b>model</b> is proposed {{in the first part}} of this paper: it captures the managers' strategy in terms of performances improvement. The search of an efficient improvement is formalized as an optimization problem. Nevertheless, MAUT models address purely managerial decisions but do not include the material constraints related to the action plans that address the required improvement. A qualitative model is thus proposed to support this implementation part. It models the relations between goals and actions to define the most relevant action plan. Finally, a unified framework is proposed to conciliate managerial and implementation aspects in an industrial improvement project. It integrates a preferences' model for the managerial aspects and a CSP model for the operational aspects. Both models are conjointly run into an iterative process to define an efficient improvement...|$|E
40|$|National audienceIn {{the current}} {{industrial}} context, strategies intended {{to bring about}} continuous improvement have to include the multi-criteria performance expression aspects. The Multi Attributes Utility Theory (MAUT) offers a relevant framework to design performances improvement in this multi criteria context. However, the <b>MAUT</b> <b>models</b> are preference models: they can only address the managerial part in the improvement design. They must be completed with other representations to cover the whole design process. To that aim optimization techniques are proposed to compute the most relevant objectives to be reached. The contribution of each partial performance to the overall performance gain then relies on a combinatory based sensitivity analysis. Finally, a fuzzy representation is proposed to model the relationships between goals and actions to tackle the implementation part of the improvement. The most relevant actions to meet the established objectives are deduced from this last model. An iterative procedure {{may be required to}} meet the expected improvement precisely...|$|R
40|$|When {{meeting the}} {{challenges}} in automatic and semi-automatic Web service composition, capturing the user’s service demand and preferences {{is as important as}} knowing what the services can do. This paper discusses the idea of semantic service requests for composite services, and presents a multi-attribute utility theory (<b>MAUT)</b> based <b>model</b> of composite service requests. Service requests are modeled as user preferences and constraints. Two preference structures, additive independence and generalized additive independence, are utilized in calculating the expected utilities of service composition outcomes. The model is also based on an iterative and incremental scheme meant to better capture requirements in accordance with service consumers’ needs. OWL-S markup vocabularies and associated inference mechanism are used as a means to bring semantics to service requests. Ontology conceptualizations and language constructs are added to OWL-S as uniform representations of possible aspects of the requests. This model of semantics in service requests enables unambiguous understanding of the service needs and more precise generation of the desired compositions. An application scenario is presented to illustrate how the proposed model can be applied in the real business world...|$|R
40|$|Disputes are {{inevitable}} in construction projects. Skills in dispute resolution {{should be part}} of the toolkit of any practitioner in a managerial position. Dispute resolution procedures such as litigation, arbitration, mediation, dispute adviser and negotiation are widely practised. However, frequently the question is how to systematically determine which dispute resolution strategy to adopt given the nature of disputes. Even though the topic of dispute resolution has been widely discussed and heavily researched, few studies have been conducted with respect to this question. A decision-making model has been developed using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and multi-attribute utility technique (<b>MAUT).</b> The <b>model</b> comprises four parts: selection criteria, dispute resolution strategies, collection of utility factors and selection criteria weightings. These were developed from empirical data collected through an interview survey with selected experts in the field. The model is designed to identify in a systematic manner an appropriate dispute resolution strategy for a given dispute, rather than relying on subjective decisions. The model is tested using a hypothetical scenario in which three case studies are evaluated.

40|$|Strategic Management {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tasks that managers in organizations are to accomplish. With the rise of domestic and international competition, the importance of strategic management has become undeniable. This is especially true in the era that the influence of governments on commerce has broadened. The aim of the present paper is to development an appropriate strategy for a company with a history of 40 years in providing production lines’ equipments for a dairy producing factory. To reach this goal, this study applies SWOT analysis along with QSPM and MAUT models. After completing the checklists provided to assess the strength points, weak points, opportunities, and threats, the weight and importance of each factor was defined by the company managers and they were interviewed for final conclusions. Based on the acquired data, EFE and IFE matrixes were calculated and the results were analyzed on diagrams. The results showed that the company was placed in the region of aggressive strategies. These results were also confirmed by QSPM matrix. The strategy of increase in share of international markets gained the highest score and therefore, became the top priority. In <b>MAUT</b> <b>model,</b> the utility of the acquired strategies by SWOT analysis, were calculated using four attributes of cost, time, infra structure, and manager’s preferences. The results were slightly different from what was acquired using QSPM model...|$|E
40|$|The Construction {{industry}} is facing {{an enormous number}} of challenges due to continuous advancements in construction technologies and techniques. Consequently construction management theories have to confront critical newly issues concerning market globalization and construction innovations. The key factor to address these challenges is to improve the competitive abilities of the competing construction firms. Literature reports that existing competitive practices for construction companies do not fully address the recent industry problems or consider the available technologies and challenges. Therefore, this research proposes a competitive assessment model {{with a wide range of}} essential factors and attributes that covers broad aspects of the present competitive market. Four new pillars (4 P) for competitiveness assessment are proposed for construction firms: (1) Organization Performance, (2) Project Performance, (3) Environment and Client, and (4) Innovation and Development. These pillars have the potential to assist construction firms manage not only short term strategic plans but also long term ones. Based on the 4 P concept, 21 factors and 80 criteria are defined and incorporated in the proposed company competitiveness assessment model. A questionnaire survey is conducted in the Canadian and Vietnamese market in order to collect 2 main sets of information. The first set includes pair wise comparison feedback regarding the relative importance of each factor, while the other set collects utility scores concerning their impacts. Based on the collected data, the AHP technique is used to calculate the factors' relative weight. In addition, the utility functions are developed in order to build the competitiveness assessment model using multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT). The developed <b>MAUT</b> <b>model</b> is tested via three case studies in which the results show that the model has a potential to demonstrate a detailed performance analysis pertaining to the competitive ability of any given construction firm...|$|E
40|$|Current asset {{management}} practices of municipal infrastructure focus on modeling water, sewer and road networks into isolated layers and hence overlook the spatial and functional interdependencies among these assets. For instance, {{the performance of}} an asset can be impacted spatially and/or functionally by its neighboring assets. Vulnerability assessment, in this study, measures the asset’s degree of susceptibility for structural and/or functional failures triggered by failure of these functions in neighboring assets. The objective {{of this research is}} to develop a computational framework for optimizing intervention policies for likely vulnerable civil infrastructure networks considering spatial and functional interdependencies. The developed framework integrates three models; 1) interdependency assessment model, 2) vulnerability assessment model and 3) system dynamics model. The interdependency assessment model captures spatially and functionally interdependent assets utilizing two developed modules: spatial interdependency module and functional interdependency module. The spatial module utilizes ArcGIS geoprocessing tools in determining geographically interdependent assets. It encapsulates interdependent assets in a set of new layers and a newly developed database containing characteristics of such interdependencies. On the other hand, the functional module employs graph theory principles in determining an asset's degree of connectivity with its neighboring assets. The functional module will aid in recognizing the likely influence of an asset failure on its neighboring assets' performance using betweenness centrality. The output of the assessment model {{is in the form of}} bundles of spatially and functionally interdependent assets. For vulnerability assessment, three computational models are developed and experimented with to rate vulnerability of civil infrastructure systems considering their spatial and functional interdependencies with neighboring assets. These models are; 1) multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT), 2) artificial neural network (ANN) and 3) fuzzy c-mean clustering (FCM). Operation and maintenance reports obtained from two Canadian municipalities (the Cities of London and Hamilton, Ontario) were used to select factors influencing the vulnerability of water, sewer and road assets. For the <b>MAUT</b> <b>model</b> and based on the identified factors from operation and maintenance reports, surveys were sent to 65 experts and their feedback was elicited to construct utility functions to rate the degree of vulnerability of interdependent assets. The response rate of the survey was 75...|$|E
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. When facilitating {{decisions}} {{in which some}} performance evaluations are uncertain, a decision must be taken about how this uncertainty is to be modelled. This involves, in part, choosing an uncertainty format {a way of representing the possible outcomes that may occur. It seems reasonable to suggest {and is an aim of the thesis to show {that the choice of how uncertain quantities are represented will exert some influence over the decision-making process and the final decision taken. Many models exist for multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) under conditions of uncertainty; perhaps the most well-known are those based on multi-attribute utility theory [MAUT, e. g. 147], which uses probability distributions to represent uncertainty. The great strength of MAUT is its axiomatic foundation, but even in its simplest form its practical implementation is formidable, and although there are several practical applications of MAUT {{reported in the literature}} [e. g. 39, 270] the number is small relative to its theoretical standing. Practical applications often use simpler decision models to aid decision making under uncertainty, based on uncertainty formats that `simplify' the full probability distributions (e. g. using expected values, variances, quantiles, etc). The aim of this thesis is to identify decision models associated with these `simplified' uncertainty formats and to evaluate the potential usefulness of these models as decision aids for problems involving uncertainty. It is hoped that doing so provides some guidance to practitioners about the types of models that may be used for uncertain decision making. The performance of simplified models is evaluated using three distinct methodological approaches {computer simulation, `laboratory' choice experiments, and real-world applications of decision analysis {in the hope of providing an integrated assessment. Chapter 3 generates a number of hypothetical decision problems by simulation, and within each problem simulates the hypothetical application of MAUT and various simplified decision models. The findings allow one to assess how the simplification of <b>MAUT</b> <b>models</b> might impact results, but do not provide any general conclusions because they are based on hypothetical decision problems and cannot evaluate practical issues like ease-of-use or the ability to generate insight that are critical to good decision aid. Chapter 4 addresses some of these limitations by reporting an experimental study consisting of choice tasks presented to numerate but unfacilitated participants. Tasks involved subjects selecting one from a set of five alternatives with uncertain attribute evaluations, with the format used to represent uncertainty and the number of objectives for the choice varied as part of the experimental design. The study is limited by the focus on descriptive rather than real prescriptive decision making, but has implications for prescriptive decision making practice in that natural tendencies are identified which may need to be overcome {{in the course of a}} prescriptive analysis...|$|R

The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a methodology that, for the different farmtypes in an irrigable area, will enable us to analyse the differential impact that a pricing policy for irrigation water would have. For this purpose, Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (<b>MAUT)</b> mathematical programming <b>models</b> have been used. The methodology is implemented on a representative area in the Duero Valley in Spain. Our results show the usefulness of differential analysis in evaluating the impact of a water pricing policy. This allows significant differences in the evolution of agricultural incomes to be observed, as well as the recovery of costs by the State, demand for agricultural employment and the consumption of agrochemicals resulting from rising prices of irrigation water in various groups of farmers within a given irrigated area...|$|R

In this article, we try to find answers to the following questions: Does structure influence performance in downstream supply chain? Can be identified a network configuration that performs better than other configurations? In finding answers to the research questions, we considered the axiom ‘what it is not measured, it cannot be managed’. In the study, we took SCOR metrics at first level as performance metrics and best practices to express each SCOR dimension. 30 top executives from World Class Manufacturers were surveyed to rate {{the importance of the}} metrics and best practices in measuring performance in downstream supply chain.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the differential impacts of various irrigation water pricing policies. The methodology used is based upon Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (<b>MAUT)</b> mathematical programming <b>models</b> and also simulation. Two kinds of data needed to feed the models were obtained from official records and surveying. The analysis of water pricing policy indicates that the most important relative savings take place in the more conservative farmers due to their risk-aversion behavior. Also it can be seen that in the elastic segments of the demand curves the increase in the price of water encourages great saving in consumption due to changes in mixed crops, crops production by deficit irrigation methods and production of rain-fed crops. Results clearly demonstrate that each homogenous group of farmers displays different behavior patterns related to this natural resource. Therefore, this shows the usefulness of differential analysis in evaluating the impact of water pricing policy...|$|R
