40|$|Recently, {{intelligent}} {{transportation systems}} (ITSs) have emerged. These systems can improve traditional transportation systems and provide traffic information to travelers. In {{the area of}} transportation, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can replace the existing wired sensors and expensive traffic monitoring systems to mitigate the time and costs of installing such systems. However, accurate and on-time traffic information delivery is a major challenge, considering the energy constraints of sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a two-tier architecture that includes a network of mobile objects (vehicles) in the upper layer and a hierarchical WSN in the bottom layer. Using this approach, a portion of loads on the low-power static sensor nodes can be transferred to mobile objects, such as powerful mobile devices. Moreover, to provide accurate and timely traffic information, a QoS-aware link cost function has been proposed and used for data transmission between the static sensor nodes. In addition, due to the mobility of the objects and the probability of losing packets in the <b>mobile</b> object <b>tier,</b> a reliable data forwarding mechanism has been proposed for this tier. In this mechanism, data packets are forwarded to the neighbors, which enhance the probability of the packets’ being received.

40|$|Abstract. Advances in {{wireless}} networking {{technology and}} portable computing devices {{have led to}} {{the emergence of a new}} computing paradigm known as mobile computing and a number of applications. As a result, software applications have to be redesigned to take advantage of this environment while accommodating the new challenges posed by mobility. As mobile users wander about, they are bound to encounter a variety of different information sources (databases) that are often autonomous and heterogeneous in nature. Such a collection of autonomous and heterogeneous database is often known as a multidatabase. The existing multidatabase systems do not readily support mobile computing. A new class of multidatabase that provides access to a large collection of data via a wireless networking connection is proposed — a Mobile Data Access System (MDAS). Within the scope of MDAS, a new transaction-processing model is proposed that allows timely and reliable access to heterogeneous and autonomous data sources while coping with the mobility issue. The proposed model extends the existing multidatabase system without any adverse effect to the preexisting local and global users. This is accomplished through the implementation of multi <b>tiered</b> <b>mobile</b> transaction proxies that manage the execution of mobile transactions on behalf of the mobile user. The proposed transaction-processing model is simulated and the results are analyzed. ...|$|R

30|$|In [13], {{the authors}} use {{relaying}} and cooperation {{to prolong the}} network lifetime. They also investigate path loss while considering different body parts for both single-hop and multi-hop topologies. Similarly, the authors in [24] use topology control to account for access delays due to the underlying medium access control (MAC) layer, however, {{at the cost of}} high energy consumption. In [25], the authors set an upper bound to determine the number of relay nodes, sensors, and their respective distances to the sink. Each sensor node performs single-hop communication while relaying nodes perform multi-hop communication to the sink. In [14], J. Elias et al. provide an optimal design for WBASNs by studying the joint data routing and relay positioning problem in order to increase the network lifetime. In this research work, the authors present an inter-based linear programming model which aims for (i) optimized number of relay positions, (ii) minimization of energy consumption of sensors and relays, and (iii) minimization of the installation cost. Simulation results show that this framework has a very short computing time as compared to the other frameworks. In [26], the authors study propagation models subject to network lifetime prolongation. These models reveal that single-hop communication is inefficient for far away nodes from the sink and the multi-hop communication is more suitable. In order to avoid hot spot links, extra nodes in the network, i.e., dedicated relay devices, are introduced. The authors in [19] propose M-ATTEMPT routing protocol in which they use single-hop communication for the delivery critical data and multi-hop communication for the delivery of normal data. In order to prevent damage of body tissues, they also introduce a temperature sensing mechanism to detect the hot spot problem of in-body sensors. In [27], Chen et al. introduce a new interference-aware WBASN that can continuously monitor vital signs of multiple patients and efficiently prioritize data transmission based on patients’ conditions. The authors proposed a solution that is based on an integrated hybrid scheduler which guarantees end-to-end delay with the capability to select the best possible route (best link quality) and minimum generated interference which results in high end-to-end packet reliability. In [28], sensing is considered as a service while improving energy efficiency. Thus, the authors present a unique set of design challenges and propose different solutions which are very helpful for current as well as future researchers. In [29], the authors present anycast routing protocol for monitoring patients vital signs while coping with the end-to-end traffic. To achieve minimum network latency, the protocol chooses a nearest data receiver related to the patient. The wireless network performs fall detection, indoor positioning, and electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring for the patients. Whenever, a fall is detected, the hospital crew gets intimated of the exact position of the patient. In [30], the authors present a cluster-based self-organization protocol. It focuses on relaying data via cluster heads to improve energy efficiency. Initially, the protocol builds a cluster-based structure and then efficiently transmits packets from source to destination. An interesting feature of this technique is the stability in terms of the selected number of cluster heads per round. In [31], the authors balance load of the sensor nodes by presenting a global routing protocol which is tested against real-time experiments along with computer-based simulations. Similarly, [32] introduces a personal wireless hub to collect personal health information of its user(s) through biomedical sensors. The sensed information is securely routed towards the health care unit if found eligible. In [33], Otto et al. present a prototype system for the health monitoring of people/patients at home. The system consists of an uninterrupted WBASN and a home health server. The WBASN sensors sense heart rate and locomotive activity such that the sensed information is periodically uploaded at the home server. The home server may integrate this information with a local database for user inspection, or it may further be forwarded to a medical server. Similarly, the idea of embedding medical devices with hospital information system is presented in [34]. The integration of ubiquitous echograph with the home information network make it very easy for the doctors to immediately diagnose the patients. In [35], Wang et al. present a distributed WBASN model for medical supervision. The system consists of three tiers: sensor network <b>tier,</b> <b>mobile</b> computing network <b>tier,</b> and remote monitoring network tier. This model provides collection, demonstration, and storage of vital information like ECG, blood oxygen, body temperature, and respiration rate. The system demonstrates many advantages such as low-power, easy configuration, convenient carrying, and real-time reliable data. In [36], the authors use wearable sensors to monitor daily activities of humans which they perform during different activities. The correct monitoring of these complex actions is challenging. For this purpose, they introduce activity recognition with the help of wearable sensing devices.|$|R
40|$|MBA, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 This study {{focuses on}} the {{telecommunication}} industry, specifically the mobile phone market {{at the base of}} the pyramid (BOP). A supply vs. demand stance is taken whereby demographic data offer insight into the demand while the location of telecommunication retail stores constitutes supply. The study furthermore makes extensive use of a GIS (geographical information system) which offers deeper insight into data and different applications thereof. Given the extensive nature of the data used in assessing the national market, a dashboard was developed as part of this research to ease data interpretation. The online map (GIS) and dashboard form an integral part of this report. Literature supports the targeting of the BOP as a viable market given the high volume of people in this market segment. Unconventional methods are, however, required to sustainably cater to this market. The development of multiple channels to target potential consumers has resulted in a dilution of the market in the retail environment. The retail channel however remains important in any company’s strategy to target the BOP. Telecommunication companies can not only benefit from the BOP but also offer benefits to the BOP. The World Bank has reported figures that show a 0. 8 % increase in GDP for every 10 % increase in mobile penetration. Different sources identify the BOP by different income ranges. It became evident, however, that internationally the average applied to identify the BOP is households earning less than USD 3, 000 (ZAR 31, 440 at an exchange rate of R 10. 48 / USD) per annum. Although somewhat higher than the international average, the available data dictated that South Africa’s BOP be identified as households earning less than R 38, 200 per annum for the purposes of this research. Data indicate that 89 % of households in South Africa have a mobile phone. By comparing the ownership of existing household goods this research found that of the 11 % of households not owning a mobile phone, 6 % would be willing to adopt a <b>mobile</b> phone. A <b>tiered</b> approach is followed in assessing the telecommunication opportunity for mobile phones in the BOP. The first tier assesses the entire market (all households in South Africa) at a municipal level. By including the total market, the opportunity in the BOP is put into perspective. The result was that the total BOP market offers a potential market of R 563 million per month through 13. 7 simcards. At the other end of the economic pyramid, the ROP offers a market of R 2416 million per month through 14. 6 million simcards. Thus, even though the BOP offers 48 % of the total volume in the market, the value is only 19 % of the total market. From a coverage perspective, 42 % of BOP households are not covered by a telecom retailer whilst only 27 % of the ROP households are not covered. A market of R 247 million (through 5. 8 million simcards) has been estimated in the BOP opposed to a R 379 million market (through 5. 8 million simcards) in the ROP. The second tier makes use of a case study to determine the viability of targeting the BOP. Moruleng Mall’s catchment area was analysed within the Moses Kotane municipality that offered a high opportunity as determined in the first tier of analysis. This case study made use of gravity modelling and found that Rustenburg’s retail offering would have limited influence and as such telecom retailers would have to revisit their strategy for the area. A number of shopping centre developments in rural areas were highlighted. Effectively while these developments are taking retail closer to the BOP or rual population, the market is diluted. From a retailer perspective, this makes it difficult to target an entire area through presence in one specific retail node or town. The ultimate finding of this this research suggests that it is in fact possible to target the BOP – however, that it is the ROP located between the BOP households that makes this a viable market. This suggests that it is rather not a question of the viability in targeting the BOP specifically but targeting the more dense rural areas that offer opportunity. Master...|$|R
