40|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>mussels</b> {{accumulate}} {{amino acids}} and glucose from seawater against considerable concentration gradients. The principal site for this uptake is the gill. Previous studies using intact, isolated gills from <b>marine</b> <b>mussels</b> {{have suggested that}} the transport mechanism involves coupling to Na⁺, similar to the mechanism of secondary active transport of amino acids and glucose in vertebrate epithelia, but until this dissertation there had been no rigorous test of this hypothesis. Brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) were prepared from the gills of the <b>marine</b> <b>mussel,</b> Mytilus edulis, by differential and sucrose density centrifugation. The preparation procedure isolated a population of membranes enriched in brush border membrane markers. The transport of amino acids by two pathways, the alanine-lysine pathway (AK) and the alanine-proline pathway (AP), and the uptake of glucose was studied in the BBMV. The mechanism of transport through the three transport pathways is BBMV involved coupling to Na⁺. Concentrative uptake through the AK pathway, which transported alanine and lysine, also occurred in the presence of Li⁺ and K⁺ gradients. This pathway was the major route for alanine transport in BBMV. The AP pathway transported alanine and proline, and was strictly dependent on Na⁺. Glucose transport in gill BBMV resembled quite closely the Na⁺-coupled transport of glucose in vertebrate epithelia in such characteristics as Na⁺ and substrate specifically, and electrogenicity. Transport through the two amino acid uptake pathways (AK and AP) and through the glucose uptake pathway could be described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with high substrate affinities (K(t) 's below 10 μM). Furthermore, it is likely that multiple Na⁺ ions are involved in the transport of these amino acids and glucose in mussel gill BBMV. It appears that these transporters are adapted for function at low substrate concentrations and against large concentration gradients...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A novel {{feature for}} animal {{mitochondrial}} genomes has been recently established: i. e., {{the presence of}} additional, lineage-specific, mtDNA-encoded proteins with functional significance. This feature has been observed in freshwater mussels with doubly uniparental inheritance of mtDNA (DUI). The latter unique system of mtDNA transmission, which also exists in some <b>marine</b> <b>mussels</b> and <b>marine</b> clams, is characterized by one mt genome inherited from the female parent (F mtDNA) and one mt genome inherited from the male parent (M mtDNA). In freshwater mussels, the novel mtDNA-encoded proteins {{have been shown to}} be mt genome-specific (i. e., one novel protein for F genomes and one novel protein for M genomes). It has been hypothesized that these novel, F- and M-specific, mtDNA-encoded proteins (and/or other F- and/or M-specific mtDNA sequences) could be responsible for the different modes of mtDNA transmission in bivalves but this remains to be demonstrated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated all complete (or nearly complete) female- and male-transmitted <b>marine</b> <b>mussel</b> mtDNAs previously sequenced for the presence of ORFs that could have functional importance in these bivalves. Our results confirm the presence of a novel F genome-specific mt ORF, of significant length (> 100 aa) and located in the control region, that most likely has functional significance in <b>marine</b> <b>mussels.</b> The identification of this ORF in five Mytilus species suggests that it has been maintained in the mytilid lineage (subfamily Mytilinae) for ∼ 13 million years. Furthermore, this ORF likely has a homologue in the F mt genome of Musculista senhousia, a DUI-containing mytilid species in the subfamily Crenellinae. We present evidence supporting the functionality of this F-specific ORF at the transcriptional, amino acid and nucleotide levels. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results offer support for the hypothesis that "novel F genome-specific mitochondrial genes" are involved in key biological functions in bivalve species with DUI...|$|R

40|$|This report {{details the}} {{research}} program investigating the potential antifouling activity of extracts from the periostracum of the <b>marine</b> <b>mussel</b> Mytilus sp [...] Previous research {{has suggested that}} <b>marine</b> <b>mussels</b> utilise multi-faceted defence mechanisms to ensure their fitness does not suffer due to heavy fouling colonisation on their shells. The shell coating known as the periostracum, is indicated as a possible physical and chemical antifouling defence component. In this study, the periostracum was separated from the shell and extracts of the periostracum obtained by serial extraction with three solvents of increasing polarity. The extracts were tested against common marine fouling organisms: diatoms, bryozoans and barnacle larvae. Considerable activity against marine diatoms and bryozoans was shown by dichloromethane and ethyl acetate extracts. Initial Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) fingerprinting of the extracts suggests the presence of fatty compounds (potentially triglycerides), hydroxylated groups and aromatics. Further purification by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and NMR analysis would be required to elucidate the structure of the compound responsible for the noted antifouling activity.

The consumption of <b>marine</b> <b>mussels</b> as popular seafood has increased steadily over the past decades. Awareness of mussel derived molecules, that promote health, has contributed to extensive research efforts in that field. This review highlights the bioactive potential of mussel components from species of the genus Mytilus (e. g. M. edulis) and Perna (e. g. P. canaliculus). In particular, the bioactivity related to three major chemical classes of mussel primary metabolites, i. e. proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, is evaluated. Within the group of proteins the focus is mainly on mussel peptides e. g. those obtained by bio-transformation processes, such as fermentation. In addition, mussel lipids, comprising polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), are discussed as compounds that are well known for prevention and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Within the third group of carbohydrates, mussel polysaccharides are investigated.

40|$|Reports {{concerning}} the quantitative analysis of pharmaceuticals in marine ecosystems are somewhat limited. It {{is necessary to}} determine pharmaceutical fate and assess any potential risk of exposure to aquatic species and ultimately, seafood consumers. However, in Ireland very {{little research has been}} carried out to determine the presence of pharmaceutical residues in the aquatic environment. The research carried out investigates the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the Irish aquatic environment and their potential to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms and pose a risk to human health via dietary intake. Pharmaceutical residues were determined in liquid matrices, such as wastewater effluent, marine surface water (MSW) and artificial seawater (ASW), using solid phase extraction (SPE) in combination with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Pharmaceutical extraction from <b>marine</b> <b>mussels</b> and fish tissues required an additional pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) step prior to SPE and LC-MS/MS. The results of an in situ study, in which caged Mytilus spp. were deployed at three sites on the Irish coastline over a 1 -year period are presented. All of the selected pharmaceuticals were quantified in wastewater effluent and marine surface waters and three out of the five monitored pharmaceuticals were detected in environmentally exposed mussel tissue.

We also extended our experimental investigation of particulate toxin to include oysters (Crassostrea sp.) grown commercially for aquaculture.

Mussels exposed to particulate microcystin purged the toxin slowly, with toxin detectable for at least 8 weeks post-exposure and maximum toxin of 39. 11 ng/g after exposure to 26. 65 μg/L microcystins. Dissolved toxin was also taken up by California mussels, with maximum concentrations of 20. 74 ng/g after exposure to 7. 74 μg/L microcystin, but was purged more rapidly.
