500|$|In 1979, Sorkin {{attended}} Syracuse University. In {{his freshman}} year he failed a class that was a core requirement. It was a devastating setback {{because he wanted to}} be an actor, and the drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes. Determined to do better, he returned in his sophomore year, and graduated in 1983. Recalling the influence on him at college of drama teacher Arthur Storch, Sorkin recalled, after Storch's death in March 2013, that [...] "Arthur's reputation as a director, and as a disciple of Lee Strasberg, was a big reason why a lot of us went to [...] 'You have the capacity to be so much better than you are', he started saying to me in September of <b>my</b> <b>senior</b> year.

[...] Gordon believed that Goulart, wanting to [...] "seize dictatorial power", was working with the Brazilian Communist Party.

Indeed, it was only 4 months into the pregnancy that she found out she was pregnant), but ended in divorce. Bazlen later married Nashville session player/producer Marlin Greene.

2500|$|... “The old days. [...] After all {{the fall}} of 1906 is a far piece back, and high school {{football}} then was a mighty casual and simple thing. [...] That was <b>my</b> <b>senior</b> year and I was a ‘new boy’, having just moved to Massillon that summer from the wide open spaces of South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska. [...] The first day at school several of my classmates came around to suggest that of course I was coming out for football; and although I protested that I {{had never had a}} ball in my hands, they countered with the argument that I was a good sized lump of a boy and would make a fine prospect. [...] So I promised. [...] Well the only preparation necessary was to take an old pair of shoes down to the town cobbler and have some cleats nailed on them. [...] I think the athletic association must have had some football pants, but I do remember distinctly that you had to furnish your own stockings (any color) and an old sweater. [...] Put these on and you were in business. [...] I can’t believe that there were more than 11 candidates out because I made the team the first afternoon. [...] Nor did we have a regular coach. [...] A boy named Fritz Merwin, who I think had played the year before was our coach. [...] If you ask me, he’s the one whose picture ought to be hanging up around there someplace. [...] He didn’t get paid anything, and if a coach ever had an awkward squad of 11 nit-wits, he did. [...] But he was out there every afternoon, early and late teaching us fundamentals instead of fancy razzle-dazzle plays, and in the end it paid off because we won a few games.
