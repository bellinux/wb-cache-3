When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is well-defined for the short term.

5|$|Any {{triangle}} or quadrilateral (even non-convex) {{can be used}} as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation, {{often in}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>way.</b> Copies of an arbitrary quadrilateral can form a tessellation with translational symmetry and 2-fold rotational symmetry with centres at the midpoints of all sides. For an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to wallpaper group p2. As fundamental domain we have the quadrilateral. Equivalently, we can construct a parallelogram subtended by a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a rotational centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and take one half (a triangle) as fundamental domain. Such a triangle has the same area as the quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting.|$|E

Hassett and Tschinkel showed that when X = P^n with n ≥ 2, there are many distinct ways that X can be realized as equivariant compactifications of C^n. Our result says that projective space is an exception: among Fano manifolds of Picard number 1 with smooth VMRT, projective space {{is the only one}} compactifying C^n equivariantly in <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>ways.</b> This answers questions raised by Hassett-Tschinkel and Arzhantsev-Sharoyko...|$|R

To enable parallel factorization, which allows a model event to be resolved in <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>ways</b> at the same time, we propose a general framework, where we adopt a backingoff lattice to reflect parallel factorizations and to define the paths along which a model is resolved into factored models, we use a mixture model to combine parallel paths in the lattice, and generalize Katz’s backing-off method to integrate all the mixture models got by traversing the entire lattice. Based on this framework, we formulate two types of model factorizations {{that are used in}} natural language modeling. ...|$|R

25|$|When {{we think}} of {{interactivity}} and its meaning, we assume {{that it is only}} prominent in the conversational dynamics of individuals who are face-to-face. This restriction of opinion does not allow us to see its existence in mediated communication forums. Interactivity is present in some programming work, such as video games. It's also viable in the operation of traditional media. In the mid 1990s, filmmakers started using inexpensive digital cameras to create films. It was also the time when moving image technology had developed, which was able to be viewed on computer desktops in full motion. This development of new media technology was a new method for artists to share their work and interact with the big world. Other settings of interactivity include radio and television talk shows, letters to the editor, listener participation in such programs, and computer and technological programming. Interactive new media has become a true benefit to every one because people can express their artwork in <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> with the technology that we have today and {{there is no longer a}} limit to what we can do with our creativity.|$|E

The first level is the mathematical background concerning the needed tools from algebraic geometry and arithmetic.
