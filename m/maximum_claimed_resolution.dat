40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the <b>claims</b> <b>resolution</b> process and procedures and determines {{the costs associated}} with the processing of a claim at the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR). With these costs identified, once a contractor entitlement has been determined, {{it will be possible to}} perform a cost-benefit analysis to determine if it would be cheaper to settle a claim up front or to continue with the <b>claims</b> <b>resolution</b> process. Data were obtained from surveys, telephone conversations, and literature. The research also identified patterns in the amount of time it takes to settle a claim. The most significant finding was that 92 percent of the total claim cases settled since 1996 were settled for less than the contractor's requested amount including the cost of processing the claim. Therefore, it makes good business sense for NAVAIR to continue with their <b>claims</b> <b>resolution</b> process. The findings also indicate that 57 percent of the total active NAVAIR claims that are either in litigation or not in litigation are associated with lapsed appropriations. In that these claims must be payed with current year funding, any improvements to the claims process that will lessen the time to final resolution will have a positive effect on current year program stability.

40|$|Aggregation {{has long}} been viewed as the primary if not sole vehicle for mass <b>claims</b> <b>resolution.</b> For a half-century, {{scholars}} have consistently viewed the consolidated litigation of similar claims through joinder, class actions and more recently multi-district litigation as the only mechanism for efficiently resolving mass claims. In this Article, I challenge that long-standing and fundamental conception. The Article seeks to reconceptualize our understanding of mass <b>claims</b> <b>resolution,</b> arguing that we are witnessing {{the birth of a}} second, unexplored branch of mass <b>claims</b> <b>resolution</b> mechanisms — which I term “disaggregative” dispute resolution systems because they lack the traditional aggregation of common questions that has been the hallmark of traditional mass claims litigation. Disaggregation returns to a focus on the individual akin to that of the single-plaintiff system, but uses either procedural or substantive streamlining, or a shift of costs to the defendant, to correct the asymmetries that prompted the creation of class actions. Many of our most innovative claims structures — from the BP GCCF and the fund created {{in the wake of the}} Costa Concordia disaster, to the common single-plaintiff arbitration clauses in consumer and employment agreements — use this new, bottom-up model of disaggregative mass <b>claims</b> <b>resolution</b> instead of the familiar top-down aggregative model. These next-generation systems have been heralded as a significant advancement in mass <b>claims</b> <b>resolution,</b> capable of awarding more compensation to claimants more quickly and at lower cost than aggregate litigation. But like the single-plaintiff and aggregate litigation systems that preceded it, disaggregation has its flaws. Because the defendant typically designs these systems, they often give rise to questions about legitimacy and the accuracy of compensation. More shockingly, situating disaggregation within the existing doctrinal trends reveals that the rise of disaggregation allows corporations to avoid class actions in a far broader swath of cases than has previously been identified — such that class actions will, as a practical matter, proceed only at the defendant’s election, raising substantial questions about the viability of private actions as a mechanism for the enforcement of law. Yet, because these systems are the product of contract, attempts to restrict these systems have largely failed. The answer to these problems lies in an unlikely and potentially controversial approach: expanding rather than restricting the availability of disaggregation, by creating a public mechanism for disaggregation — comparable to the existing public aggregation mechanisms...|$|R

The article 2 ̆ 7 s first section presents historical information about Holocaust claims against Swiss banks. Specifically, it attempts {{to answer the question}} of why it has taken so long for Holocaust reparation claims against Swiss banks to be processed. The author blames this delay primarily on the obfuscation by the Swiss banks and the inattention of the Swiss government[,] which is indicated by the fact that a complete accounting of the banks 2 ̆ 7 Holocaust-era activities was not publicized until the mid 19902 ̆ 7 s {{under the direction of the}} Volcker Commission. Next, the article provides information about the <b>Claims</b> <b>Resolution</b> Tribunal 2 ̆ 7 s <b>claims</b> <b>resolution</b> procedures. This tribunal, established by the Volcker Commission, was charged with arbitrating Holocaust reparation claims brought by private citizens against Swiss banks. It explains how <b>claims</b> <b>resolutions</b> procedures were modified throughout the history of the tribunal to expedite the process and ensure that the tribunal focused only on those claims that were truly related to losses caused by the Holocaust. This is followed by an analysis of the most challenging legal issues related to resolving Holocaust claims against Swiss banks, including burden of proof and plausibility problems, choice of law conflicts, and difficulties in determining whether claimants were truly descended from Holocaust victims. The article concludes with a discussion of what reparation and restitution claims accomplish in terms of moral accounting to the families of the victims, and the damage done to all the parties involved by the banks 2 ̆ 7 failure to address their moral responsibilities related to Holocaust claims in a timely matter...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} a natural {{extension of the}} banker’s algorithm for deadlock avoidance in operating systems. Representing the control flow of each process as a rooted tree of nodes corresponding to resource requests and releases, we propose a quadratic-time algorithm which decomposes each flow graph into a nested family of regions, such that all allocated resources are released before the control leaves a region. Also, information on the <b>maximum</b> resource <b>claims</b> for each of the regions can be extracted prior to process execution. By inserting operating system calls when entering a new region for each process at runtime, and applying the original banker’s algorithm for deadlock avoidance, this method has the potential to achieve better resource utilization because information on the “localized approximate <b>maximum</b> <b>claims</b> ” is used for testing system safety.
