40|$|International audienceThe Earth's {{rotation}} axis {{is constantly}} tracking the <b>main</b> <b>inertia</b> <b>axis</b> {{of the planet}} that evolves due to internal and surface mass rearrangements. This motion called True Polar Wander (TPW) is due to mantle convection on the million years time scale. Most studies assumed that on this long time scale the planet readjusts without delay and that the Earth's rotation axis and the Maximum Inertia Direction of Mantle Convection (MID-MC) coincide. We herein overcome this approximation that leads to inaccurate TPW predictions and we provide a new treatment of Earth's rotation discussing both analytical and numerical solutions. We obtain an average TPW rate in the range [0. 5 °- 1. 5 °] Myr− 1 and a sizeable offset of several degrees between the rotation axis and the MID-MC. This is in distinct contrast with the general belief that these two axes should coincide or that the delay of the readjustment of the rotational bulge can be neglected in TPW studies. We thus clarify a fundamental issue related to mantle mass heterogeneities and to TPW dynamics...|$|E
40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} {{that during the}} late Quaternary glaciation the Black Sea formed an isolated inland lake (Ross et al., 1970). New geological data and the recognition of sudden population movements away from the Black Sea coasts suggest that the basin was rapidly flooded through the Bosphorus sill 7150 years bp, causing a sea level rise of ~ 135 m {{in a few years}} (Ryan et al., 1997). As shown here, such a catastrophic redistribution of mass has significantly altered the amplitude of the Chandler wobble, the free motion of the pole of rotation around the <b>main</b> <b>inertia</b> <b>axis</b> of the Earth (Lambeck, 1980). We also estimate that during the flooding the pole of rotation was diverted from its secular path and shifted by ~ 30 m, at a rate of several meters per year. These rotational variations are found to be orders of magnitude larger than those produced by other short-term geophysical processes, such as earthquakes seismic moment release (O'Connell and Dziewonski, 1979; Chao et al., 1996), anthropogenic water impoundment (Chao, 1995), and tectonic mass movements (Alfonsi and Spada, 1998). The Black Sea flooding may thus be responsible for the most drastic change in the rotational parameters of the Earth in the recent history of our planet...|$|E

40|$|The recent booming of multiphoton imaging of {{collagen}} fibrils {{by means}} of second harmonic generation microscopy generates {{the need for the}} development and automation of quantitative methods for image analysis. Standard approaches sequentially analyse two-dimensional (2 D) slices to gain knowledge on the spatial arrangement and dimension of the fibrils, whereas the reconstructed three-dimensional (3 D) image yields better information about these characteristics. In this work, a 3 D analysis method is proposed for second harmonic generation images of collagen fibrils, based on a recently developed 3 D fibre quantification method. This analysis uses operators from mathematical morphology. The fibril structure is scanned with a directional distance transform. Inertia moments of the directional distances yield the main fibre orientation, corresponding to the <b>main</b> <b>inertia</b> <b>axis.</b> The collaboration of directional distances and fibre orientation delivers a geometrical estimate of the fibre radius. The results include local maps as well as global distribution of orientation and radius of the fibrils over the 3 D image. They also bring a segmentation of the image into foreground and background, as well as a classification of the foreground pixels into the preferred orientations. This accurate determination of the spatial arrangement of the fibrils within a 3 D data set will be most relevant in biomedical applications.

At present, {{it is not clear whether}} the offset of Venus is the result of the limited resolution of the gravity models or, alternatively, it may be regarded as an evidence in support to the existence of a wobble. Purpose of this note is to demonstrate on quantitative grounds that an offset between spin <b>axis</b> and maximum <b>inertia</b> <b>axis</b> is to be expected on the time‐scales of mantle convection, due to the peculiar rotational characteristics of Venus. We also show that the inertia perturbation associated to the rising of hot thermal plumes from the core‐mantle boundary to the surface is large enough to maintain offsets ranging between 0. 1 and 1 °. Of course, this does not preclude that other processes, such as Venusquakes or periodic atmospheric variabilities, may contribute significantly to the observed offset on shorter time‐scales...|$|R

It is noted that the amplitudes of other coefficients are similar to the predicted coefficients using Kaula's rule under equal stress assumption.

A radial acceleration map at 100 km above the Venus surface is generated, and correlation between gravity anomalies and major topographic features is observed. Spectral analysis of the harmonic model suggests that the interior density anomalies are like those on earth.

Details {{of the conference}} are {{available}} at: [URL] paper considers PD attitude control of magnetically actuated satellites where one <b>axis</b> of <b>inertia</b> is considerably {{lower than that of}} the other two. The classic ‘torque-projection’ method of implementing the control is unsuitable for this configuration as the nature of the torque projection controller places little significance on the low <b>inertia</b> <b>axis.</b> This paper proposes a modification to the PD approach by determining the dipole moments through minimisation of a performance index rather than projection onto the magnetic field orthogonal. This allows fairer consideration of the low <b>inertia</b> <b>axis</b> and leads to improved performance of the feedback control. This approach is taken further by introducing an element of feed-forward control to improve the disturbance rejection properties of the system. In a similar way the required feed-forward compensation is determined through minimisation of an appropriate performance index. Combination of the feed-forward and feedback control successfully regulates the satellite attitude when assessed using a high fidelity simulation model.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the role of rotation axes during a tennis serve. A motion capture system was used to evaluate the contribution of the potential axes of rotation (minimum <b>inertia</b> <b>axis,</b> shoulder-centre of mass axis and the shoulder-elbow axis) during the four discrete tennis serve phases (loading, cocking, acceleration and follow through). Ten ranked athletes (International Tennis Number 1 - 3) repeatedly performed a flat service aiming at a target on the other side of the net. The four serve phases are distinct and thus, each movement phase seems to be organised around specific rotation axes. The results showed that the limbs' rotational axis does not necessarily coincide with the minimum <b>inertia</b> <b>axis</b> across the cocking phase of the tennis serve. Even though individual serving strategies were exposed, all participants showed an effect due to the cocking phase and changed the rotation axis during the task.

40|$|International audienceThe velocity-dependent {{change in}} {{rotational}} axes observed during {{the control of}} unconstrained 3 D arm rotations may obey the principle of minimum inertia resistance (MIR). Rotating the arm around the minimum <b>inertia</b> tensor <b>axis</b> (e 3) reduces the contribution of muscle torque to net torque by employing interaction torque. The present experiment tested whether the MIR principle still governs rotational movements when subjects were instructed to maintain the humeral long axis (SH-EL) {{as closely as possible}} to horizontal. With this view, the variability of 3 D trajectories of the minimum <b>inertia</b> <b>axis</b> (e 3), shoulder-center of mass axis (SH-CM) and shoulder-elbow axis (SH-EL) was quantified using a VICON V 8 i motion capture system. The axis for which the 3 D variability displacement is minimal is considered as the one constraining the control of arm rotation. Subjects (n= 15) rotated their arm in two elbow angular configurations (Elb 90 ° vs. Elb 140 °), two angular velocity conditions (slow S vs. fast F), and two sensory conditions (kinaesthetic K vs. visuo-kinaesthetic VK). The minimum <b>inertia</b> <b>axis</b> e 3 is angled 5. 4 ° away from SH-CM axis, and varied from 27 ° to 15 ° away from de SH-EL axis, for Elb 90 ° and Elb 140 °, respectively. We tested whether the participants would be able to maintain the instructed SH-EL rotation axis or if increasing the frequency of the arm rotations would override the initial rotation instructions and cause the limb to rotate around an axis closely aligned with e 3. We expected that VK inputs would minimize the variability of the SH-EL axis and that K should facilitate the detection and rotation around e 3 at the faster velocity. Taken together the results showed that the initial instruction, favoring rotation around the SH-EL axis, prevented the velocity-dependent change towards the minimum inertia (e 3) and/or the mass axis (SH-CM), i. e., use of the MIR principle. However, the variability of the SH-EL axis was significantly increased in the F condition, confirming that arm rotations around the SH-EL axis produces larger mechanical instabilities in comparison to when the arm is rotated around a mass/inertial axis (Isableu et al., 2009) ...|$|R

The conclusion is reached that for the prevention of such flutter complete dynamic balance should always maintain. Flexural-torsional flutter is investigated in considerable detail from the consideration of the dynamical equations for steady state forced oscillations of the two dimensional case. A complete set of response curves for two typical cases are included to show the types of responses that should be observed in flight with vibration pick-up equipment. The important fact is brought out that the response and behavior of the wing at its natural bending frequency has little or no correlation with the behavior of the wing at the stability limit of flutter. Curves are presented to show that, for normal airplanes, the most important parameters which determine flutter in this mode are (a) the position of the <b>inertia</b> <b>axis,</b> (b) the torsional frequency, end (c) the radius of gyration of the wing mass about the <b>inertia</b> <b>axis.</b> The dynamical equations are set up for the cases of flexural-aileron, torsional-aileron, and flexural-torsional-aileron flutter in the two-dimensional case and an example is given of the determination of the stability limit of a specific example of the first of these modes. An extension of the two-dimensional case to the three-dimensional case is presented with particular reference to determining the flexural-torsional flutter speed of a tail surface with vertical surfaces on the tips of the horizontals. The method of attack is outlined for the calculation of natural frequencies at zero airspeed to use in determining the flutter speed.
