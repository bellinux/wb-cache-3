5|$|Hurricane Lili caused great {{environmental}} {{damage to the}} <b>marshes</b> and barrier islands in Louisiana. Huge fish kills were observed in <b>marshes</b> near the landfall point, and in the Atchafalaya Swamp. The barrier islands {{to the east of}} the landfall point, those subjected to the highest surge, were severely eroded. Sand was also deposited behind them into the brackish <b>marshes,</b> burying vegetation. The freshwater <b>marshes</b> were severely damaged by the wind and surge, some of them completely destroyed. The severe erosion created new waterways connecting inland bodies of water with the Gulf of Mexico, which eventually led to further erosion of inland lagoons.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of European agricultural methods, the shores of San Francisco Bay consisted mostly of tidal <b>marshes.</b> Today, the bay has been significantly altered heavily re-engineered to accommodate the needs of water delivery, shipping, agriculture, and urban development, with side effects including the loss of wetlands and {{the introduction}} of contaminants and invasive species. Approximately 85% of those <b>marshes</b> have been lost or destroyed, but about 50 <b>marshes</b> and marsh fragments remain. Huge tracts of the <b>marshes</b> were originally destroyed by farmers for agricultural purposes, then repurposed to serve as salt evaporation ponds to produce salt for food and other purposes. Today, regulations limit the destruction of tidal <b>marshes,</b> and large portions are currently being rehabilitated to its natural state.|$|E
5|$|The American {{black duck}} is a habitat generalist {{as it is}} {{associated}} with tidal <b>marshes</b> and present throughout the year in salt <b>marshes</b> from the Gulf of Maine to coastal Virginia. It usually prefers freshwater and coastal wetlands throughout northeastern America, including brackish <b>marshes,</b> estuaries and edges of backwater ponds and rivers lined by speckled alder. It also inhabits beaver ponds, shallow lakes with sedges and reeds, bogs in open boreal and mixed hardwood forests, as well as forested swamps. Populations in Vermont have also been found in glacial kettle ponds surrounded by bog mats. During winter, the American black duck mostly inhabits brackish <b>marshes</b> bordering bays, agricultural <b>marshes,</b> flooded timber, agricultural fields, estuaries and riverine areas. Ducks usually take shelter from hunting and other disturbances by moving to brackish and fresh impoundments on conservation land.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{evolution}} of a fringing salt <b>marsh</b> {{is influenced by the}} interaction of many factors, including relative sea-level rise, <b>marsh</b> ag-gradation, nearshore sedimentation, wave climate, and tidal range. Ris-ing relative sea levels generally cause the marsh/upland border to transgress the uplands, thereby potentially increasing the areal extent of a <b>marsh.</b> In contrast, the <b>marsh</b> shoreline may either retreat or prograde in response to the interaction between <b>marsh</b> and lagoonal processes. Consequently, the direction and rate of <b>marsh</b> shoreline movement are critical factors in governing the areal extent of a <b>marsh.</b> Therefore, based on the geomorphic history of a fringing salt <b>marsh</b> in Rehoboth Bay, Delaware, a model for the response of a <b>marsh</b> shore-line is presented. Depending upon the relative rates of <b>marsh</b> and la-goonal processes, a <b>marsh</b> shoreline can either (1) retreat by erosion, (2) prograde, or (3) drown in response to local relative sea-level rise. Specifically, if the rate of <b>marsh</b> aggradation is equal to or greater than the rate of relative sea-level rise (RSLR), then the <b>marsh</b> shoreline either progrades or erodes if the nearshore sedimentation rate is great-er than or less than the rate of RSLR, respectively. If the <b>marsh</b> ag-gradation rate is less than the rate of RSLR, then the <b>marsh</b> drowns...|$|R

50|$|High salt <b>marsh</b> dieback, or salt <b>marsh</b> browning, is {{the primary}} force in salt <b>marsh</b> {{degradation}} in the high <b>marsh.</b> The general effect is that the plants in the <b>marsh</b> die off and brown, leaving dead organic matter, and ultimately open sediment.
