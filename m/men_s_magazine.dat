40|$|Considered a {{children}} s picture book classic, J. M. Barrie s Peter Pan script and subsequent versions (including Disney s platinum boxed DVD set) had their origin in Barrie s earlier text entitled Little White Bird. This latter text is now recognised as an autobiographical treatise on paedophilia {{in general and}} Barrie s obsession with one young boy in particular. Literary myth has also suggested that this text appeared in a <b>men</b> <b>s</b> only <b>magazine,</b> which had paedophiliac leanings, as perhaps the first sealed centrefold. With the exception of Rose s 1 brief mention of this publication which fits into her belief that in Pan - murkiness {{is not so much}} hidden underneath as running all along the seams - few analytic readings of Barrie s text deal with the transtextual nature of Peter Pan or how it relates to the concept of evil. Using the principles of Lakoff s - folk theory of language -, this paper argues that because Peter Pan arose in a time and place when Freudian psychology was on the rise, and when Barrie had begun to wrestle with what he perceived to be the social epitome of evil, Peter Pan represents a polyvalent autobiography of liminality, in which the surface plot is underpinned by - where the elements of culture and society are released from their customary configurations and recombined in, bizarre or terrifying ways -. In other words, Barrie 2 ̆ 7 s language use represents - heavy words lightly thrown -, an untapped definition of evil couched in the language of {{a children}} s text...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of globalization, commercialization, and the {{increasing}} presence of Western and Japanese male images in Chinese society, this study {{is an attempt to}} examine how local and global force interact and how masculinities are constructed in men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> in Taiwan. Methodologically, this study sees in-depth interviews, content analysis, and semiotic analysis as complementary methods in the study of construction of masculinity in Taiwan. Results of the interviews showed that multiple types of masculinity exist in Taiwan and traditional Chinese masculinity has evolved and changed in the contemporary Taiwanese society. Based on the male images (N= 1, 284) from a stratified sample of four months in 2009 in four men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines,</b> results of the study showed that editorials and male images in Western and hybrid men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> were also different from those in the local men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazine.</b> Close examination of individual advertisements form semiotic analysis showed that advertisers try to relate muscle building to Wu masculinity; athleticism, male bonding, feminine masculinity are promoted by advertisers; metrosexuality seems the ideal masculinity in Taiwanese society. In conclusion, the study suggested that (1) international men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines,</b> either from the West or Japan, can be seen as culture hybrid to construct masculinity in their contents. Although international men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> are all hybrid, hybridity in men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> that are from countries that are geographically close are much influential than hybrid magazines from geographically far away; (2) the Chinese masculinity should not be labeled as feminine masculinity because it is ordinary manhood from the Chinese Wen tradition...|$|R

40|$|Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> in Australia {{have become}} {{increasingly}} involved in various public health awareness campaigns. In particular, breast cancer has been targeted as an issue for attention. This disease occupies a privileged position in women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines,</b> being represented as treatable and survivable {{with an emphasis on}} the advocacy of early detection through breast self-examination and screening programs. In this way, women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> can be seen to be proactive in serving the public interest of their readers. Information and advice about breast cancer are not limited to medical articles, advice columns and diet pages, but occur, perhaps more accessibly, in feature articles of personal accounts of experiences with breast cancer.

40|$|Theories of {{sexuality}} and consumption are increasingly entwined in the critical discourse of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines.</b> This reflects the growing importance {{of sexuality}} in the shifting representation of femininity. Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> are seen as pivotal, not only in charting women 2 ̆ 7 s lives, but also in asserting the importance of consumption in constructing femininity. Contemporary women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> in Western societies feature the dominance of sexual images, from sexy models to the discussion of sex. Underpinning this trend {{is the notion that}} sexuality sells. Sexuality thus becomes a dominant phenomenon in the commodification of Western femininity. In this paper, I want to question the universality of this phenomenon in the context of franchised magazines. The result of internationalization has precipitated the flow of images across overseas editions. Imported into the local editions, do these images {{of sexuality and}} sex necessarily sell {{in the same way as}} they do in the parent titles? Existing research around women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> concentrates on the sale of sexuality in the Western culture, without questioning its relevance to overseas editions. As a result, it neglects the importance of social and cultural specificities which affect the reading of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines.</b> Using Cosmopolitan Hong Kong as an example, I will redress this monolithic view by examining how a non-Western culture responds to the inflow of Western elements. Positing sexuality as a site for cultural debate, I will investigate the extent to which sexy images and sex articles pose a problem for the local edition, and how the edition has to repackage these images to cater for local readership. The analysis of images in the Hong Kong edition seems particularly urgent, as it is situated in a society which is under-going rapid political and economic changes. In so doing, I will also demonstrate the dynamism of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magazines</b> as a form of business as well as cultural commodity...|$|R

Using Hofstede's cultural dimension of masculinity/femininity, the hookup culture (i. e., the relational context of sex, emotional context of sex, specific sexual activities, and contraceptives) was examined in 2, 496 stories from all 2006 through 2008 {{issues of the}} three most popular U.

The purpose of this research explains the process to deliver the information about male 2 ̆ 7 s and female 2 ̆ 7 s identities in explicit or implicit way. The writer analyzes the submission of information in Da Man, Details, and Esquire magazines for describing the identity of male. Then, the writer uses Nylon, Vogue, Glamour, and Cosmopolitan magazines to identify the identity of female. The difference of language used and the submission of information between male and female are phenomena of language that are analyzed through the writer 2 ̆ 7 s point of view by using some theories. The writer uses descriptive qualitative perspectives to determine the language USAge between male and female in fashion magazines. The theory of explicature and implicature are used by the writer to analyze the submission of information in male 2 ̆ 7 s and female 2 ̆ 7 s articles through the objects of clothes, perfumes, and shoes. In the method of collecting data, the writer applies documentation method and note taking technique. From the data analysis, the writer concludes that the components of colors do not affect the appearance of male 2 ̆ 7 s identity because the colors describe neutral colors. On the other side, female has close relation with the component of colors because female has her own colors, such as pink, gold, and fuchsia to represent the identity of female as a feminine person. Then, the submission of meaning in representing male 2 ̆ 7 s and female 2 ̆ 7 s identity can be categorized in two ways, such as in explicit or implicit way. Both of ways have the important role to determine the influence characteristics between male and female.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} South African <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement {{and the possible}} influences of {{various factors such as}} demographic characteristics, expenditure on clothing, the frequency of clothing purchases, store patronage and <b>men</b> <b>s</b> work dress code. A survey was conducted across Gauteng which is the largest retail hub in South Africa with mainly urban areas. Most consumers in Gauteng have access to different clothing retailers. Consulta Research, a professional research company assisted with data collection. Data was collected by means of convenient sampling. Online questionnaires were distributed to their data base and a total of 479 usable questionnaires were completed. Data analysis consisted of descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, ANOVA s, Chi square tests and other post hoc tests. The study confirmed that men clothing involvement is not equally strong for all four dimensions of clothing involvement that are distinguished in literature. Previous studies suggested that involvement should be studied from an age ordering perspective, and therefore respondents demographic characteristics were vital in terms of the analysis of the data. Certain demographic characteristics seemed to be good indicators of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement, namely age and marital status while factors such as work dress code surprisingly {{do not seem to be}} useful to predict <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement. The majority of the sample spent less than 5 % of their monthly household income on clothing for themselves and indicated that they purchase clothing sporadically when necessary. Findings nevertheless indicated that expenditure on their clothing and frequency of clothing purchases are useful indicators of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement. Although younger men (generation Y) were more inclined to patronise specialised <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing retailers, irrespective of their work dress code, the majority of men patronised general retailers and department stores when purchasing their clothing. Findings confirm that consumption- and purchase involvement are the prevalent forms of clothing involvement that are relevant in terms of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing behaviour. Indications are that <b>men</b> <b>s</b> advertising involvement is not particularly strong, which implies that they gain their product information and fashion information from alternative sources that rather relates to purchase involvement which tested high in most cases. This has implications for retail because <b>men</b> <b>s</b> stronger purchase involvement probably means that the physical retail environment is more important in terms of fashion information and to inspire <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing purchases. Therefore retailers should focus more on factors that make in-store decisions easier for males such as displays and placement of clothing. Male apparel is a potentially lucrative and growing market that can be even more profitable. Younger men spend more on their clothing therefore this group should therefore take preference but the older men should not be forgotten. Based on the findings of this study various recommendations are made with a large focus to either expand this study or build onto this existing research. Topics related to male clothing and involvement of clothing can definitely be built on and studied more in the apparel industry to fill a gap on knowledge that is lacking and should be explored further.
