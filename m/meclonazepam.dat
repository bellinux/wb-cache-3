50|$|In the UK, <b>meclonazepam</b> {{has been}} {{classified}} as a Class C drug by the May 2017 amendment to The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 along {{with several other}} designer benzodiazepine drugs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meclonazepam</b> ((S)-3-methylclonazepam) was {{discovered}} by a team at Hoffmann-La Roche in the 1970s and is a drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative similar in structure to clonazepam. It has sedative and anxiolytic actions like those of other benzodiazepines, and also has anti-parasitic effects against the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni.|$|E
40|$|<b>Meclonazepam</b> is a {{benzodiazepine}} patented in 1977 {{to treat}} parasitic worms, which recently {{appeared as a}} designer benzodiazepine and drug of abuse. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify metabolites suitable as biomarkers of drug intake in urine using high-resolution mass spectrometry, authentic urine samples, and different model systems including human liver microsomes, cryopreserved hepatocytes, and a mice model. The main metabolites of <b>meclonazepam</b> found in human urine were amino-meclonazepam and acetamido-meclonazepam; also, minor peaks for <b>meclonazepam</b> were observed in three of four urine samples. These observations are consistent with <b>meclonazepam</b> having a metabolism similar to that of other nitro containing benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, flunitrazepam, and nitrazepam. Both metabolites were produced by the hepatocytes and in the mice model, but the human liver microsomes were only capable of producing minor amounts of the amino metabolite. However, under nitrogen, the amount of amino-meclonazepam produced increased 140 times. This study comprehensively elucidated <b>meclonazepam</b> metabolism and also illustrates that careful selection of in vitro model systems for drug metabolism is needed, always taking into account the expected metabolism of the tested drug...|$|E
40|$|Cys-loop ligand-gated ion {{channels}} (LGICs) mediate fast ionotropic neurotransmission. They {{are proven}} drug targets in nematodes and arthropods, but are poorly characterized in flatworms. In this study, we characterized the anion-selective, non-acetylcholine-gated Cys-loop LGICs from Schistosoma mansoni. Full-length cDNAs {{were obtained for}} SmGluCl- 1 (Smp_ 096480), SmGluCl- 2 (Smp_ 015630) and SmGluCl- 3 (Smp_ 104890). A partial cDNA was retrieved for SmGluCl- 4 (Smp_ 099500 /Smp_ 176730). Phylogenetic analyses suggest that SmGluCl- 1, SmGluCl- 2, SmGluCl- 3 and SmGluCl- 4 belong to a novel clade of flatworm glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCl) that includes putative genes from trematodes and cestodes. The flatworm GluCl clade was distinct from the nematode-arthropod and mollusc GluCl clades, and from all GABA receptors. We {{found no evidence of}} GABA receptors in S. mansoni. SmGluCl- 1, SmGluCl- 2 and SmGluCl- 3 subunits were characterized by two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) in Xenopus oocytes, and shown to encode Cl⁻-permeable channels gated by glutamate. SmGluCl- 2 and SmGluCl- 3 produced functional homomers, while SmGluCl- 1 formed heteromers with SmGluCl- 2. Concentration-response relationships revealed that the sensitivity of SmGluCl receptors to L-glutamate is among the highest reported for GluCl receptors, with EC₅₀ values of 7 - 26 µM. Chloride selectivity was confirmed by current-voltage (I/V) relationships. SmGluCl receptors are insensitive to 1 µM ivermectin (IVM), indicating that they do not belong to the highly IVM-sensitive GluClα subtype group. SmGluCl receptors are also insensitive to 10 µM <b>meclonazepam,</b> a schistosomicidal benzodiazepine. These results provide the first molecular evidence showing the contribution of GluCl receptors to L-glutamate signaling in S. mansoni, an unprecedented finding in parasitic flatworms. Further work is needed to elucidate the roles of GluCl receptors in schistosomes and to explore their potential as drug targets...|$|E
