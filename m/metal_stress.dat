40|$|Abstract: Exposure {{of plants}} to toxic {{concentrations}} of metals leads to {{disruption of the}} cellular redox status followed by an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS, like hydrogen peroxide, can act as signaling molecules in the cell and induce signaling via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. MAPK cascades are evolutionary conserved signal transduction modules, able to convert extracellular signals to appropriate cellular responses. In this review, our current understanding about MAPK signaling in plant <b>metal</b> <b>stress</b> is discussed. However, this knowledge is scarce compared to research {{into the role of}} MAPK signaling in the case of other abiotic and biotic stresses. ROS production is a common response induced by different stresses and undiscovered analogies may exist with <b>metal</b> <b>stress.</b> Therefore, further attention is given to MAPK signaling in other biotic and abiotic stresses and its interplay with other signaling pathways to create a framework in which the involvement of MAPK signaling in <b>metal</b> <b>stress</b> may be studied...|$|E

40|$|Background: Heavy metals {{are major}} {{environmental}} pollutant when they present in high concentration in soil and have toxic effects on {{growth and development}} of plants. Industrial activities result in heavy metal pollution of large areas of land, which greatly affects natural vegetation. Understanding the mechanism of how plants combat heavy metals adverse effects is hence of great importance. Materials and Methods: Two different localities were chosen; one locality was {{in the vicinity of}} gypsum factory and the other one was 25 km away from the factory. Two Zygophyllum species (Z. album and Z. coccineum) were naturally grown in the studied areas. The effects of soil heavy <b>metal</b> <b>stress</b> on shoot heavy metal concentrations, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme activities and the root plasma membrane (PM) lipid composition were analyzed. Results: Heavy metal concentrations and Lipid peroxidation increased in the shoot of both species grown in the polluted area. The activities of ascorbate oxidase (ASO), guaiacal peroxidase (GPX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were increased whereas these of catalase (CAT) were decreased in both species under the polluted conditions. PM total lipids, phospholipids, glycolipids and sterols were decreased in Z. album and Z. coccineum {{as a result of the}} polluted soil. Heavy <b>metal</b> <b>stress</b> increased phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and decreased phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phophatidylglycerol (PG), with no significant change in phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the root PM of both species.

Heavy <b>metal</b> <b>stress</b> changed the composition and concentration of fatty acids of the root PM, resulting in increased sat/unsat ratio of both species.

The strains were identified as Serratia proteamaculans, Leucobacter chromiireducens and Brevibacterium frigoritolerans. The inhibition of polyamine synthesis by α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) caused a decrease in Cr(VI) tolerance in the bacterial isolates, indicating the role of endogenous polyamines in resistance to Cr(VI). The exogenous application of polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, cadaverine) was found to stimulate growth and Cr(VI) reduction by the bacterial strains in Luria-Bertani medium. The results show the importance of polyamines in response to heavy <b>metal</b> <b>stresses,</b> especially Cr(VI) toxicity...|$|R
