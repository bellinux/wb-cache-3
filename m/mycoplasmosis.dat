It is found throughout the world and infection may be referred to as Infectious Synovitis, Avian <b>Mycoplasmosis,</b> Infectious Sinusitis and Mycoplasma Arthritis. It is of economic importance because infection can cause a drop in egg production. The disease is most commonly seen in chickens, and transmission occurs both vertically and horizontally.|$|E
50|$|Welfare {{concerns}} {{include the}} threat of crocodilian diseases such as caiman pox, adenoviral Hepatitis, <b>mycoplasmosis,</b> and chlamydiosis. Crocodiles suffer from stress in confined spaces such as farms, leading to disease outbreaks. Most crocodilians keep a body temperature within 28 and 33 degrees Celsius. On farms, body temperatures can reach 36 degrees Celsius, which affects the animals' immune system, and puts them at risk of various illnesses.

50|$|<b>Mycoplasmosis</b> is the {{infection}} of Mycoplasma bacteria. Mycoplasmas have many defining characteristics.

Mycoplasma can cause disease in humans, animals, insects, and plants. Mycoplasma attach to host epithelial cells, {{such as in the}} respiratory tract, which causes cell damage and inflammatory response. There are currently over 100 species of Mycoplasma known. The following have been isolated from wild birds: Mycoplasma buteonis, Mycoplasma corogypsi, Mycoplasma falconis, Mycoplasma gypis, Mycoplasma sturni, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum. M. gallisepticum has the most significant effect on wild birds.|$|E
50|$|Illnesses {{affecting}} crocodilians include crocodile pox, {{which is}} caused by Parapoxvirus, affecting hatchlings and juveniles. It causes a brown residue to form around the eyes, oral cavity, and tail. Caiman pox similarly causes white lesions around the eyes, oral cavity, and tail. Adenoviral Hepatitis causes organ failure and death. <b>Mycoplasmosis</b> causes polyarthritis and pneumonia in crocodilians {{under the age of}} three. Infected animals have swollen jaws and are unable to move. Chlamydiosis has two forms that affects juveniles under one year of age. The first causes acute hepatitis, usually resulting in death. The other causes chronic bilateral conjunctivitis, usually resulting in blindness. Parasitic infections include tapeworm cysts, Trichinella spiralis nelsoni in the meat of Nile crocodiles in Zimbabwe, and Coccidia.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTortoise <b>mycoplasmosis</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{extensively}} characterized infectious diseases of chelonians. A 1989 outbreak of upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) in free-ranging Agassiz's desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) brought together an investigative team of researchers, diagnosticians, pathologists, immunologists and clinicians from multiple institutions and agencies. Electron microscopic studies of affected tortoises revealed a microorganism in close association with the nasal mucosa that subsequently was identified as a new species, Mycoplasma agassizii. Over the next 24 [*]years, a second causative agent, Mycoplasma testudineum, was discovered, the geographic distribution and host range of tortoise <b>mycoplasmosis</b> were expanded, diagnostic tests were developed and refined for antibody and pathogen detection, transmission studies confirmed the pathogenicity of the original M. [*]agassizii isolate, clinical (and subclinical) disease and laboratory abnormalities were characterized, many extrinsic and predisposing factors were found to play a role in morbidity and mortality associated with mycoplasmal infection, and social behavior was implicated in disease transmission. The translation of scientific research into management decisions has sometimes led to undesirable outcomes, such as euthanasia of clinically healthy tortoises.

40|$|Abstract. To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that sialodacryoadenitis virus infection could exacerbate respiratory my-coplasmosis in rats, four groups of 40 7 - to 9 -week-old gnotobiotic F 344 /N rats were given two intranasal inoculations 7 days apart: Mycoplasma pulmonis, then sialodacryoadenitis virus; M. pulmonis followed by sterile culture medium; medium initially, then virus; or two doses of medium. Immediately and 3, 5, 10, and 20 days after the second inoculation, the nasal passages, middle ears, larynges, tracheas, lungs, and salivary and lacrimal glands of four rats from each group were prepared for histologic examination, and the respiratory organs from four other rats were collected for quantitative culture of M. pulmonis and sialodacryoadenitis virus. To test statistically the effect of virus infection on <b>mycoplasmosis</b> lesions, we determined indices {{of the severity of}} respiratory tract lesions by subjective scoring. In rats given both organisms, indices of nasal and tracheal lesions were significantly (P < 0. 05) greater at 3 days and after than in rats given M. pulmonis alone, and middle ear, laryngeal, and lung lesion indices were significantly greater at 5 days and after. Rats given both mycoplasma and virus had significantly more mycoplasmal colony-forming units in the nasal passages at 3 days and after, and in the larynges, tracheas, and lungs at 10 and 20 days, than rats given only mycoplasma. These results show that sialodacryoadenitis virus infection can exacerbate respiratory <b>mycoplasmosis</b> in rats under experimental conditions; therefore, the virus probably also contributes to expression of naturally occurring <b>mycoplasmosis...</b>|$|E

This is a {{case study}} of Feline Hemotropic <b>Mycoplasmosis</b> (previously known as Feline Haemobartonellosis) in a young adult male feline with the sudden onset of signs associated with hemolytic anemia. Feline Hemotropic <b>Mycoplasmosis</b> (or FHM) is a "parasitic" infection of the red blood cells that results in both intravascular and extravascular hemolysis. There are two etiologic agents that infect feline red blood cells: Mycoplasma haemofelis (large form) and Mycoplasma haemominutum (small form). Mycoplasma haemofelis was previously known as the Rickettsial agent Haemobartonella felis. It was recently reclassified due to new information from PCR, Western Blot, and DNA Sequencing tests. Presenting complaint is commonly the sudden onset of behavior changes, lethargy, weakness, and/or pale, icteric mucous membranes. Diagnosis is based on blood smear evaluation. PCR assays are also available. Treatment involves a 3 week course of oral tetracyclines; doxycycline is the drug of choice at 5 mg/kg once daily. Glucocorticoids may be administered to reduce extravascular hemolysis. Prognosis of uncomplicated FHM with treatment is excellent although affected cats remain carriers of the organism for life.

The chamber was operated with a nebulizer air flow of 5. 3 liters/min at 5. 0 lb/in and a diluting air flow of 20 liters/min, with the nebulizer containing 5 ml of a suspension of viable M. pulmonis organisms (a concentration between 6 X 10 (5) to 6 X 10 (10) CFU/ml). Infective aerosol particles of less than a 4. 0 -micron median aerodynamic diameter with a geometric standard deviation of approximately 2. 0 reached the lungs and were evenly distributed among the different lung lobes.
