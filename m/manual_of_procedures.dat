Children need to be taught rules for games, instead of expected to figure out rules for games they {{do not know how to}} play. Safe play includes students who have learned how to take turns, and handle conflict or ask for help when needed.

40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Licenciatura en Ingeniería en Construcción) Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. Escuela de Ingeniería en Construcción, 2010. This {{project is}} based on the design of a {{management}} plan that includes cost and time for the project administration of the construction company Jiménez & Sojo, company responsible for applying the present project. It is expected to design and implement the best methodology for the subject under discussion, the project management. To achieve this, it was necessary to use the Guide for the Fundamentals of Project Management. Based on it, it was necessary to develop also the range of projects. To accomplish this goal, it was decided to propose a methodology for the three areas in discussion, range, cost and time, using templates and interrelated tools that allow their development. As a final product, it was necessary to develop a <b>manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures</b> in order to initiate, plan and monitor more closely the construction projects that will be developed in the company. It´s concluded that the generation of the above management plan allows companies to develop future construction projects more effectively and with more order in their administration. This is why the referred proposed plan should be viewed as a tool to execute construction projects in a standardized manner to reduce the downside risks and increase the quality and productivity.

40|$|The Cooperative Societies {{which were}} {{originally}} arranged {{along the lines}} of a producer’s co-operative, operating in the Australian colonial Territory of Papua New Guinea, have been well documented. The formation and operations of Cooperatives whether for a political or economic rational in agricultural development, has been well "dissected" by McAuley (1952), Morris (1958) Nicholls (1972), Guines (1976), Snowden (1981), Vele (1981), and others. However, I am going to discuss the development Rural Progress Societies as grass root rural organisations that were perceived by the Department of Agriculture Sock and Fisheries as forerunners to Co-operative Societies. They were seen as "initially transitory … which may develop into private companies or continue as registered producer Co-operative Societies" (DASF <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Procedures,</b> 1967, Section G (I) A 1). Rural Progress Societies were not conceived in opposition to DDS/NA Cooperatives but were to be established in primitive areas lacking saleable cash crops, transport facilities and commercial and banking facilities (Stace, 1961, p. 55.). Rural Progress Societies and their significance to agriculture reform in the Territory, seems to have been overlooked in literature on agricultural development especially as an aid in the economic development policy of the Australian Administration. This can be substantiated by the fact that Brown (1966) noted the lack of detailed studies of Rural Progress Societies. Much of the literature being presented in this paper has been sourced from the Department of Agriculture Stock and Fisheries (DASF) Annual Reports, the DASF Extension and Procedures Manual, Annual Reports on the Trust Territory of New Guinea to the United Nations, District Officers’ Conferences, DASF Circular Memorandums, and DASF Extension Officers’ in-service training papers...|$|E
