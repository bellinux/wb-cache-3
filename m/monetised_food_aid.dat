40|$|A {{functional}} financial sector, including {{foreign currency}} market {{is critical to}} enable effective private sector imports of essentials such as food. Donor funded technical assistance can support this, and {{is more likely to}} be effective where political will and security conditions are moving in a positive direction. Where there is an operational parallel market, imports can get constrained by lack of access to foreign exchange. In cases where trading through the official rate is no longer credible for donors, donor flows can help deepen parallel market operations which can benefit domestic traders requiring foreign exchange for imports. <b>Monetised</b> <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> can provide some relief to severe shortages in domestic markets, providing care is taken to not distort local markets or consumption preferences. The domestic funds raised through this process will require a use. It is an aid modality primarily used by the USA. Concessional credit lines from bilateral sources exist where there is the political interest to underwrite the risk. However OECD bilateral donors are generally risk adverse in terms of export credit to fragile states. Most aid-related funding to support balance of payments, which in turn help support food imports in low income countries, is channelled through subsidised International Financial Institution (IFI) credit lines. There are some cases where bilateral donors have worked to facilitate financial flows in crisis affected states to directly or indirectly support imports; in Somalia’s case there was considerable effort to avoid hawala 1 remittance flows being constrained, which are critical for financing food imports into Somalia. In Zimbabwe, a donor fund that guarantees foreign exchange payment of maize imports against domestic payments has recently been set up to help ease an acute need for staple food imports...|$|E

By examining patterns of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> distribution and resource allocation among groups of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> recipients and non-recipients, the article suggests that <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> has not encouraged dependency-like behaviors.

Two forms of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> delivery are considered: first is project <b>food</b> <b>aid,</b> under which <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> is used to finance infrastructure development and consumers are required to participate in public projects in order to receive food aid; the second is non-project <b>food</b> <b>aid,</b> which we use to capture all forms of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> distributed to consumers free of charge. The model suggests that, when <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> is used to finance infrastructure development, it has no labor disincentive effects in the food industry, increases food security and decreases the level of unemployment in the recipient country. When <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> is distributed to consumers free of charge, however, the model predicts that it creates labor disincentive effects in the food industry, increases the unemployment level and decreases food security.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examined}} {{impacts of}} <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> on domestic <b>food</b> production employing a {{computable general equilibrium}} modelling technique and using data from Ethiopia. The simulation experiments have shown that <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> has unambiguous disincentive effects on domestic food production. The removal of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> caused a modest increase in food prices but this stimulated food production. Employment and income generation effects of the latter outweighed the adverse effect of the former. Consequently, the removal of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> led to improvements in aggregate household welfare. Contrary to some concerns in the <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> literature that any reduction in <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> would hurt the poor, the simulation experiments suggested that actually poor rural household and urban wage earners {{are the ones who}} benefit most in absence of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> but entrepreneurs are more likely to encounter a marginal welfare decline.

Although <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> can have negative unintended consequences, the empirical evidence is thin and often contradictory.
