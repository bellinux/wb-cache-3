5|$|Mini Metro is {{a puzzle}} {{strategy}} video game developed by indie development team Dinosaur Polo Club. Players are tasked with constructing an efficient rail transit network for {{a rapidly growing}} city. Stations are represented by differently shaped nodes and players can build tracks to connect them by drawing lines. Levels are based on real cities {{and the appearance of}} stations and passengers is procedurally generated. The game's visual style makes use of bold colours and simple geometry to replicate the appearance of modern transit maps. The game uses a procedural audio system to generate sounds based on the player actions and transit network. The rhythms and sounds created took inspiration from works of <b>minimal</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the <b>minimal</b> <b>music</b> {{that emerged}} in the late 1960s, quintuple meter is not often encountered. A rare {{exception}} is found in an early work by Steve Reich, Reed Phase (1966), which is built on the constant repetition of a five-note basic unit in steady quavers.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to {{working as a}} producer, Cale initiated a solo recording career in early 1970. His first album, Vintage Violence, is a lushly-produced roots rock effort indebted {{to a range of}} disparate influences, including The Band, Leonard Cohen, The Byrds and Brian Wilson. The more experimental Church of Anthrax (a collaboration with <b>minimal</b> <b>music</b> pioneer Terry Riley) followed in February 1971, although it was actually recorded nearly a year prior to its release. While his classical explorations briefly continued with 1972's The Academy in Peril, he would not compose in the classical mode thereafter until he began working on film soundtracks in the 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|Glass's {{compositions}} {{have been}} described as <b>minimal</b> <b>music,</b> similar to other [...] "minimalist" [...] composers including LaMonte Young, Steve Reich and Terry Riley.

2500|$|Composition on Girugamesh {{is fairly}} {{consistent}} with other albums, with the lyrics being written by vocalist Satoshi, {{and most of the}} music being written by drummer Ryo, with <b>minimal</b> <b>music</b> composed by Nii and Shuu. The lyrics in the album are often about controversial subjects such as war and hatred. The lyricist, Satoshi, has stated that his lyrics were often written on tour and the [...] "main inspirations are from situations and human relationships me". The music, being mainly composed by Ryo, was often produced when [...] "sit around at home playing piano, guitar or programming some drum sequences," [...] and the intention was to [...] "make the songs shorter and more efficient" [...] with the heavy sound.|$|E
2500|$|Many of {{the later}} 20th-century composers in various modernist and minimalist styles came from outside of New York City, such as John Cage from Los Angeles, though many studied, performed, or {{conducted}} in New York. John Corigliano, however, is a New York native who has worked exclusively in tonal idioms {{for most of his}} career. [...] Steve Reich innovated a technique known as phasing, in which two musical activities are begun simultaneously and repeated, gradually drifting out of sync with each other in a natural evolution. Reich was also very interested in non-Western music, incorporating African rhythmic techniques in his compositions Drumming. Rhys Chatham as well as Glenn Branca blended the <b>minimal</b> <b>music</b> with modern rock esthetics and began writing microtonal pieces for large orchestras of guitarists but also wrote other classical pieces with non-amplified instruments. Kyle Gann is a musicologist as well as a composer of post modern pieces.|$|E

2500|$|Lou Reed's double LP Metal Machine Music (1975) {{is cited}} as {{containing}} the primary characteristics {{of what would}} in time become a genre known as noise music. The album is an early, well-known example of commercial studio noise music that the music critic Lester Bangs has sarcastically called the [...] "greatest album ever made {{in the history of}} the human eardrum". It has also been cited as one of the [...] "worst albums of all time". Reed was well aware of the drone music of La Monte Young. Young's Theatre of Eternal Music was a <b>minimal</b> <b>music</b> noise group in the mid-60s with John Cale, Marian Zazeela, Henry Flynt, Angus Maclise, Tony Conrad, and others. The Theatre of Eternal Music's discordant sustained notes and loud amplification had influenced Cale's subsequent contribution to The Velvet Underground in his use of both discordance and feedback. Cale and Conrad have released noise music recordings they made during the mid-sixties, such as Cale's Inside the Dream Syndicate series (The Dream Syndicate being the alternative name given by Cale and Conrad to their collective work with Young).|$|E
5000|$|Leonard Meyer {{described}} <b>minimal</b> <b>music</b> in 1994:Because {{there is}} little sense of goal-directed motion, <b>minimal</b> <b>music</b> {{does not seem to}} move from one place to another. Within any musical segment there may be some sense of direction, but frequently the segments fail to lead to or imply one another. They simply follow one another.As Kyle Gann puts it, the tonality used in <b>minimal</b> <b>music</b> lacks [...] "goal-oriented European associations".|$|E
