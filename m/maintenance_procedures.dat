5|$|The Peruvian {{government}} {{investigated the}} accident, {{and in its}} final report concluded that the probable cause of the accident was the improper execution of engine-out procedures by the flight crew, with contributing factors of improper loading of the aircraft and improper <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedures</b> by company personnel. There was also evidence of a coverup and falsification of critical maintenance records by LANSA employees during the investigation process. The Peruvian government subsequently fined LANSA {{and some of its}} employees, and suspended the airline's operating license for 90 days as a consequence.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{accident}} {{did not result}} in a large number of deaths, it exposed major stewardship shortcomings of the privatised national railway infrastructure company Railtrack. Reports found {{there was a lack of}} communication and some staff were not aware of <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedures.</b> Railtrack subsequently went into administration and was replaced by Network Rail. The aftermath of {{the accident}} saw widespread speed limit reductions throughout the rail network and a tightening of health and safety procedures, the repercussions of which were still felt up to 15 years later. In 2005, both Network Rail and the contractor Balfour Beatty were found guilty of breaching health and safety laws.|$|E

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Effective {{dewatering}} and refrigeration {{are crucial}} in mining. Cascading dewatering systems, which {{are common in}} deep gold mines, are very energy intensive. These systems present several opportunities for energy cost savings initiatives. Due to rising costs in the gold-mining industry and the stagnant gold price, these initiatives need to be sustained. Maintenance is therefore required on several sections to ensure sustainability. The literature study in this dissertation investigates the major sections affected by maintenance. Detailed investigations highlight problems that affect project performance negatively. These investigations, together with the literature study, were {{used to create a}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure.</b> The focus of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure</b> is on identifying problems and presenting recommended solutions. The new <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure</b> is divided into four sections: data loss, mechanical, control and instrumentation, and control parameters. Data loss can be rectified by retrieving data and addressing the cause of the issue. Mechanical problems are fixed by following equipment-specific procedures. Control and instrumentation is divided into software, communication and instrumentation subsections. Each of these categories present several steps to deliver feasible solutions. The control parameters section consists of subsections relating to constraints, preferences and feedback. The new <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure</b> ensures that the system is effectively controlled within all constraints â€“ thereby sustaining energy cost savings measures. All the procedures use continued feedback to ensure project sustainability and client satisfaction. The impact of the new <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure</b> was tested using three case studies. The results proved that structured maintenance helps to maintain sustainable energy cost savings. The combined target impact for the three case studies was an average evening peak load shift of 8. 39 MW. The combined average impact achieved during the selected twelve months was 10. 16 MW, which resulted in an approximate cost saving of R 8. 05 million. The significant savings sustained confirm the importance of the new <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure.</b> Master...|$|R
5|$|While {{maintenance}} {{issues and}} not the actual design of the aircraft were ultimately found responsible for the crash, the accident and subsequent grounding of all DC-10s by the Federal Aviation Administration added to an already unfavorable reputation of the DC-10 aircraft {{in the eyes of}} the public, caused by several other incidents and accidents involving the type. The investigation also revealed other DC-10s with damage caused by the same faulty maintenance procedure. The faulty procedure was banned, and the aircraft type went on to have a long career as a passenger and cargo aircraft. In response to this accident, American Airlines was fined $500,000 by the U.S. government for improper <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedures.</b>|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{found that}} as the jet was {{beginning}} its takeoff rotation, engine number one separated from the left wing, flipping {{over the top of}} the wing and landing on the runway. As the engine separated from the aircraft, it severed hydraulic lines that locked the wing's leading edge slats in place and damaged a three-foot section of the left wing's leading edge. Aerodynamic forces acting on the wing resulted in an uncommanded retraction of the outboard slats. As the jet began to climb, the damaged left wing, with no engine, produced far less lift (stalled) than the right wing, with its slats still deployed and its engine running at full takeoff speed. The disrupted and unbalanced aerodynamics of the aircraft caused it to roll abruptly to the left until it was partially inverted, reaching a bank angle of 112 degrees, before crashing in an open field by a trailer park near the end of the runway. The engine separation was attributed to damage to the pylon structure holding the engine to the wing, caused by improper <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedures</b> used at American Airlines.|$|E
5|$|The first attacks {{conducted}} under LeMay's leadership achieved mixed results. XXIBomber Command flew {{six major}} missions between 23January and 19February with little success, though an incendiary raid against Kobe on 4February caused significant {{damage to the}} city and its main factories. Moreover, while improved <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedures</b> implemented by LeMay reduced the number of B-29s that had to return to base during raids due to technical problems, the Command suffered a loss rate of 5.1% in these operations. From 19February to 3March, XXI Bomber Command conducted a series of precision bombing raids on aircraft factories that sought to tie down Japanese air units so they could not participate in the Battle of Iwo Jima. However, these attacks were frustrated by high winds and cloud cover and little damage was inflicted. A firebombing raid conducted against Tokyo by 172 B-29s on 25February was considered successful as it burnt or damaged approximately one square mile of the city's urban area. This attack was a large-scale test of the effectiveness of firebombing.|$|E

5|$|In late 2002, after {{airlines}} expressed {{reservations about}} {{its emphasis on}} speed over cost reduction, Boeing halted development of the Sonic Cruiser. The following year, the manufacturer announced the 7E7, a mid-size 767 successor made from composite materials which promised to be 20percent more fuel efficient. The new jetliner was {{the first stage of}} a replacement aircraft initiative called the Boeing Yellowstone Project. Customers embraced the 7E7, later renamed 787 Dreamliner, and within two years it had become the fastest-selling airliner in the company's history. In 2005, Boeing opted to continue 767 production despite record Dreamliner sales, citing a need to provide customers waiting for the 787 with a more readily available option. Subsequently, the 767-300ER was offered to customers affected by 787 delays, including All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines. Some aging 767s, exceeding 20 years in age, were also kept in service past planned retirement dates due to the delays. To extend the operational lives of older aircraft, airlines increased heavy <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedures,</b> including D-check teardowns and inspections for corrosion, a recurring issue on aging 767s. The first 787s entered service with All Nippon Airways in October 2011, 42 months behind schedule.|$|E
5|$|Word that Lewis was {{developing}} his own {{solutions to the}} minimum range problem reached the AI team at St Athan some time in early 1940. Bowen was extremely upset. He had become used {{to the way the}} researchers had been put into an ill-advised attempt at production but now Rowe was directly removing them from the research effort as well. Tizard heard of the complaints and visited Dundee in an attempt to smooth them over, which evidently failed. On 29 March 1940 a memo from Watt's DCD office announced a reorganization of the Airborne Group. Gerald Touch would move to the RAE to help develop production, installation and <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedures</b> for the Mk. IV, several other members would disperse to RAF airfields to help train the ground and air crews directly on the units, {{while the rest of the}} team, including Lovell and Hodgkin, would re-join the main radar research teams in Dundee.

50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{officials}} {{discovered that}} a <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure</b> was the cause. American Airlines mechanics had removed the engine and its pylon as a unit, rather than removing the engine from the pylon then removing the pylon from the wing, as recommended by McDonnell Douglas. The faulty procedure was done using a forklift which resulted in inadvertent structural damage. It was subsequently discovered that this short-cut procedure, believed to save many man-hours on maintenance, was being used by three major airlines, although McDonnell Douglas had advised against it. In November 1979, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) fined American Airlines $500,000 for using this faulty <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure.</b> Continental Airlines was similarly fined $100,000.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} a care bundle, with a novel line <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure,</b> in reducing the rate of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU). DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Before-and-after study using CLABSI data reported to the Victorian Healthcare Associated Infection Surveillance System (VICNISS), in adult patients admitted to a tertiary adult ICU in regional Victoria between 1 July 2006 and 30 June 2014. VICNISS-reported CLABSI cases were reviewed for verification. An intervention was implemented in 2009. INTERVENTION: The care bundle introduced in 2009 included a previously established line insertion procedure and a novel line <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure</b> comprising Biopatch, daily 2 % chlorhexidine body wash, daily ICU central line review, and liaison nurse follow-up of central lines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CLABSI rate (cases per 1000 central line days). RESULTS: The average CLABSI rate fell from 2. 2 / 1000 central line days (peak of 5. 2 / 1000 central line days in quarter 4, 2008) during the pre-intervention period to 0. 5 / 1000 central line days (0 / 1000 central line days from July 2012 to July 2014) during the post-intervention period. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that this care bundle, using a novel <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure,</b> can effectively reduce the CLABSI rate and maintain it at zero out to 2 years...|$|R
