5|$|Denise Mina had {{not written}} for comics {{when she took}} over the title in 2006, but had three {{acclaimed}} crime novels to her name, the Garnetthill trilogy, {{the first of which}} won the CWA award for best debut crime novel. Her run on the title took John to Scotland, to attempt to stop a plot to <b>make</b> <b>everybody</b> empathise with each other. However, John fails to stop this, and, overwhelmed by the grief and horror they're forced to empathically share, suicides abound through the people of Glasgow. With help from Gemma Constantine, Angie Spatchcock and Chas Chandler, a plan to reverse the problem is made, as tension builds among the soldiers now surrounding the city. The soldiers keenly listen to a World Cup match between England and Portugal on the radio. When England loses the match, it seems all is lost, but the expected psychic riot fails to materialize. The soldiers are Scottish, so England's loss is celebrated, saving the day, and proving there's no source of joy like Schadenfreude.|$|E

500|$|The King did {{his best}} to endear himself to the people. Charlotte Williams-Wynn wrote shortly after his accession: [...] "Hitherto the King has been indefatigable in his efforts to make himself popular, and do good natured and amiable things in every {{possible}} instance." [...] Emily Eden noted: [...] "He is an immense improvement on the last unforgiving animal, who died growling sulkily in his den at Windsor.

Army interest in the Avrocar program was apparently very high. Bernard Lindenbaum of the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory recalls a trip to Washington in the late 1950s to request additional funding for a study on helicopter drag reduction. Although the funding was approved, he overheard an Army General remark that the Huey would be the last helicopter the Army would buy since the helicopter would be replaced by the Avrocar.|$|E

When they are taken to see him, Regina (Zoë Bell) jumps {{off the side of the}} ship, having wrapped herself in chains, but Gault dismisses it as [...] "a {{heightened}} case of cabin fever", and asserts that losing her is better than losing several more in saving her. He says that he is employed by Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), Desmond's girlfriend's father, and later takes them into his cabin, and tells that [...] Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) faked the plane crash by expending tremendous resources in the process and procured 324 dead bodies to <b>make</b> <b>everybody</b> believe that all the passengers were dead. Gault proceeds by saying that is one of the reasons why Mr. Widmore is keen on finding Benjamin Linus [...] and the island. After their meeting, Desmond and Sayid are relocated to a different part of the ship, where they meet Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau, Jr.) working as a deckhand under the alias [...] "Kevin Johnson".|$|E

In early 2008, Hitsugaya was voted the most popular character in the series, replacing Ichigo, who had previously held the position. Hyōrinmaru was voted the most popular zanpakutō in the zanpakutō popularity poll of the series. In the 2007 Japanese Newtype magazine character polls, he was voted the 9th most popular male character in any anime. In the 28th Annual Animage Readers' Poll, Anime Grand Prix, Hitsugaya was voted as the eighth most popular male anime character. He has also been featured in similar Animage monthly polls. Hitsugaya ranked eighth in 2008 and third in 2009 in a survey titled [...] "The Character I Want to Be My Groom" [...] from the Japanese music distributor Recochoku. In order to promote the second film of Bleach, the trailer had the line [...] "Execute Hitsugaya!". Kubo admitted that it was his own idea to <b>make</b> <b>everybody</b> be surprised, but he and Masakazu Morita, the voice actor of Ichigo, received a lot of letters from worried fans, causing Kubo to apologize in response. Various merchandise based on Hitsugaya's appearance has been created, including action figures, plush toys and key chains.|$|E
500|$|During {{its first}} run, Bringing Up Baby made $715,000 in the U.S. and $394,000 in foreign markets {{for a total}} of $1,109,000; its reissue in 1940 and 1941 made an {{additional}} $95,000 in the US and $55,000 in foreign markets. Following its second run, the film made a profit of $163,000. Due to its perceived failure, Hawks was released early from his two-film contract with RKO and Gunga Din was eventually directed by George Stevens. Hawks later said the film [...] "had a great fault and I learned an awful lot from that. There were no normal people in it. Everyone you met was a screwball and since that time I learned my lesson and don't intend ever again to <b>make</b> <b>everybody</b> crazy". The director went on to work with RKO on three films over the next decade. Long before Bringing Up Babys release, Hepburn had been branded [...] "box-office poison" [...] by Harry Brandt (president of the Independent Theatre Owners of America) and thus was allowed to buy out her RKO contract for $22,000. However, many critics marveled at her new skill at low comedy; Life magazine called her [...] "the surprise of the picture". Hepburn's former boyfriend Howard Hughes bought RKO in 1941, and sold it in 1959; when he sold the company, Hughes retained the copyright to six films (including Bringing Up Baby).|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea of the}} human-Jesus is {{a central}} piece in {{analyzing}} Pilgrim's eventual struggle with fate and free will. By establishing a Christian figure that is not initially divine in nature sets a completely different tone to the overall understanding of humanity's placement with God. In David Vanderwerken's piece [...] "Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five at Forty: Billy Pilgrim - Even More a Man of Our Time," [...] Vanderwerken states that the narrator may be calling for a [...] "humanly centered Christianity in which Jesus is a ‘nobody’ (94), a ‘bum’ (95), a man."What Vonnegut suggests here is that Christ’s divinity {{stands in the way}} of charity. If the [...] "bum" [...] is Everyman, then we are all adopted children of God; we are all Christs and should treat each other accordingly. If Jesus is human, then He is imperfect and must necessarily be involved in direct or indirect evil. This Jesus participates fully in the human condition.There is some question of Christ’s divinity and how that plays a part in Christian principles and it is suggested that the voice in the novel desires a form of collectivism where humanity looks at one another as equal parts and equal heirs of God. This human-Jesus argument within the novel stands as an effort to make humanity, whom Trout may consider to be [...] "bums" [...] and [...] "nobodies," [...] have more importance.The narration's call for a more human-Jesus and Christianity is seen in {{the last part of the}} discussion on Trout’s novel where God speaks from heaven stating, [...] "From this moment on, He [...] will punish horribly anybody who torments a bum who has not connections!" [...] Trout’s novel attempts to <b>make</b> <b>everybody</b> somebody, as well as to emphasize the supposed cruelty of original Christian thinking, and how it ought to be changed.|$|E
2500|$|Joe Martin, Jackson Montgomery, Jeff Martin, Josh, Kendall Hart Slater, and Zach Slater {{all know}} that Babe is alive. At Josh's request, Joe and Jeff make it their mission to <b>make</b> <b>everybody</b> think that Babe is really dead. Babe suffers {{a heart attack and}} briefly slips into a coma after being {{poisoned}} by the Satin Slayer. She is secretly taken to a room at Zach's casino, where Josh takes care of her while she recovers from her attack. When she wakes up, Josh initially lies and tells her she is at the hospital. He does not tell her that her family and the rest of Pine Valley believes she is dead, and leads her to believe that JR does not care at all. Zoe mourns for her best friend. Bianca is devastated at the news of Babe's [...] "death," [...] and shows regret for not forgiving her when she had the chance. Later, with the revelation of Babe being alive and well, Bianca has her chance to do so, and finally and truly repairs their damaged friendship. After Bianca tells Zoe that Babe is still alive, Zoe is naturally happy as well. JR and Babe see each other {{for the first time since}} her presumed death and he asks her for forgiveness in how he has treated her in the past, but Babe feels that they are better left separated. Ironically enough, Babe's near-death finally earns her Kendall's forgiveness as well for the incident with Miranda. Kendall even stands up for Babe against Greenlee Smythe's attacks on her, lauding Babe's achievements at Fusion. Greenlee eventually drives Babe to quit, but she is forced to hire her back when it is discovered the music promotional campaign she has secured with Zoe is contingent on Babe's presence at the company. Even Erica shows some forgiveness towards Babe, thanking her for helping Kendall and keeping Fusion going after the accident with Spike.|$|E
