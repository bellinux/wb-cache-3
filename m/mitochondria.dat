5|$|A few {{groups of}} {{unicellular}} eukaryotes have only vestigial <b>mitochondria</b> or derived structures: the microsporidians, metamonads, and archamoebae. These groups appear {{as the most}} primitive eukaryotes on phylogenetic trees constructed using rRNA information, which once suggested that they appeared before the origin of <b>mitochondria.</b> However, this is now known to be an artifact of long-branch attraction—they are derived groups and retain genes or organelles derived from <b>mitochondria</b> (e.g., mitosomes and hydrogenosomes).|$|E
5|$|An individual's {{mitochondrial}} {{genes are}} not inherited {{by the same}} mechanism as nuclear genes. Typically, the <b>mitochondria</b> are inherited from one parent only. In humans, when an egg cell is fertilized by a sperm, the egg nucleus and sperm nucleus each contribute equally to the genetic makeup of the zygote nucleus. In contrast, the <b>mitochondria,</b> and therefore the mitochondrial DNA, usually come from the egg only. The sperm's <b>mitochondria</b> enter the egg, but do not contribute genetic information to the embryo. Instead, paternal <b>mitochondria</b> are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the embryo. The egg cell contains relatively few <b>mitochondria,</b> but it is these <b>mitochondria</b> that survive and divide to populate {{the cells of the}} adult organism. <b>Mitochondria</b> are, therefore, in most cases inherited only from mothers, a pattern known as maternal inheritance. This mode is seen in most organisms, including the majority of animals. However, <b>mitochondria</b> in some species can sometimes be inherited paternally. This is the norm among certain coniferous plants, although not in pine trees and yews. For Mytilids, paternal inheritance only occurs within males of the species. It has been suggested that it occurs at a very low level in humans. There is a recent suggestion that <b>mitochondria</b> that shorten male lifespan stay in the system because they are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out <b>mitochondria</b> that reduce female survival as such <b>mitochondria</b> {{are less likely to be}} passed on to the next generation. Therefore, it is suggested that human females and female animals tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.|$|E
5|$|In as {{different}} groups as animals and trypanosomes, the <b>mitochondria</b> contain both stabilising and destabilising poly(A) tails. Destabilising polyadenylation targets both mRNA and noncoding RNAs. The poly(A) tails are 43 nucleotides long on average. The stabilising ones {{start at the}} stop codon, and without them the stop codon (UAA) is not complete as the genome only encodes the U or UA part. Plant <b>mitochondria</b> have only destabilising polyadenylation, and yeast <b>mitochondria</b> have no polyadenylation at all.|$|E
5|$|The first {{high-resolution}} electron micrographs {{appeared in}} 1952, replacing the Janus Green stains as the preferred way of visualising the <b>mitochondria.</b> This {{led to a}} more {{detailed analysis of the}} structure of the <b>mitochondria,</b> including confirmation that they were surrounded by a membrane. It also showed a second membrane inside the <b>mitochondria</b> that folded up in ridges dividing up the inner chamber and that the size and shape of the <b>mitochondria</b> varied from cell to cell.|$|E
5|$|ATP {{production}} by a non-photosynthetic aerobic eukaryote occurs {{mainly in the}} <b>mitochondria,</b> which comprise nearly 25% {{of the volume of}} a typical cell.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{experiments}} using minced muscle cells {{demonstrated that}} cellular respiration using one oxygen atom can form two adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules, and, in 1941, {{the concept of}} the phosphate bonds of ATP being a form of energy in cellular metabolism was developed by Fritz Albert Lipmann. In the following years, the mechanism behind cellular respiration was further elaborated, although its link to the <b>mitochondria</b> was not known. The introduction of tissue fractionation by Albert Claude allowed <b>mitochondria</b> to be isolated from other cell fractions and biochemical analysis to be conducted on them alone. In 1946, he concluded that cytochrome oxidase and other enzymes responsible for the respiratory chain were isolated to the mitchondria. Eugene Kennedy and Albert Lehninger discovered in 1948 that <b>mitochondria</b> are the site of oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotes. Over time, the fractionation method was further developed, improving the quality of the <b>mitochondria</b> isolated, and other elements of cell respiration were determined to occur in the <b>mitochondria.</b>|$|E
5|$|In human cells, and {{eukaryotic}} {{cells in}} general, DNA {{is found in}} two cellular locations— inside the nucleus and inside the <b>mitochondria.</b> Nuclear DNA (nDNA) exists as chromatin during non-replicative stages of the cell cycle and is condensed into aggregate structures known as chromosomes during cell division. In either state the DNA is highly compacted and wound up around bead-like proteins called histones. Whenever a cell needs to express the genetic information encoded in its nDNA the required chromosomal region is unravelled, genes located therein are expressed, and then the region is condensed back to its resting conformation. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is located inside <b>mitochondria</b> organelles, exists in multiple copies, and is also tightly associated {{with a number of}} proteins to form a complex known as the nucleoid. Inside <b>mitochondria,</b> reactive oxygen species (ROS), or free radicals, byproducts of the constant production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation, create a highly oxidative environment that is known to damage mtDNA. A critical enzyme in counteracting the toxicity of these species is superoxide dismutase, which is present in both the <b>mitochondria</b> and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells.|$|E
5|$|Madeleine L'Engle's 1973 science fantasy novel A Wind in the Door {{prominently}} {{features the}} <b>mitochondria</b> of main character Charles Wallace Murry, as being inhabited by creatures {{known as the}} farandolae. The novel also features other characters travelling inside one of Murry's <b>mitochondria.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Mitochondria</b> (and related structures) {{are found}} in all eukaryotes (except one—the Oxymonad Monocercomonoides sp.). Although {{commonly}} depicted as bean-like structures they form a highly dynamic network {{in the majority of}} cells where they constantly undergo fission and fusion. <b>Mitochondria</b> vary in number and location according to cell type. A single mitochondrion is often found in unicellular organisms. Conversely, numerous <b>mitochondria</b> {{are found in}} human liver cells, with about 1000–2000 <b>mitochondria</b> per cell, making up 1/5 of the cell volume. The population of all the <b>mitochondria</b> of a given cell constitutes the chondriome. The mitochondrial content of otherwise similar cells can vary substantially in size and membrane potential, with differences arising from sources including uneven partitioning at cell divisions, leading to extrinsic differences in ATP levels and downstream cellular processes. The <b>mitochondria</b> can be found nestled between myofibrils of muscle or wrapped around the sperm flagellum. Often, they form a complex 3D branching network inside the cell with the cytoskeleton. The association with the cytoskeleton determines mitochondrial shape, which can affect the function as well: different structures of the mitochondrial network may afford the population a variety of physical, chemical, and signalling advantages or disadvantages. <b>Mitochondria</b> in cells are always distributed along microtubules and the distribution of these organelles is also correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Recent evidence suggests that vimentin, one of the components of the cytoskeleton, is also critical to the association with the cytoskeleton.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mitochondria</b> divide by binary fission, {{similar to}} {{bacterial}} cell division. The regulation of this division differs between eukaryotes. In many single-celled eukaryotes, their growth and division {{is linked to}} the cell cycle. For example, a single mitochondrion may divide synchronously with the nucleus. This division and segregation process must be tightly controlled so that each daughter cell receives at least one mitochondrion. In other eukaryotes (in mammals for example), <b>mitochondria</b> may replicate their DNA and divide mainly in response to the energy needs of the cell, rather than in phase with the cell cycle. When the energy needs of a cell are high, <b>mitochondria</b> grow and divide. When the energy use is low, <b>mitochondria</b> are destroyed or become inactive. In such examples, and in contrast to the situation in many single celled eukaryotes, <b>mitochondria</b> are apparently randomly distributed to the daughter cells during the division of the cytoplasm. Understanding of mitochondrial dynamics, which is described as the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission, has revealed that functional and structural alterations in mitochondrial morphology are important factors in pathologies associated with several disease conditions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mitochondria</b> {{stripped}} of their outer membrane are called mitoplasts.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondria-mediated {{oxidative}} stress {{plays a role}} in cardiomyopathy in Type 2 diabetics. Increased fatty acid delivery to the heart increases fatty acid uptake by cardiomyocytes, resulting in increased fatty acid oxidation in these cells. This process increases the reducing equivalents available to the electron transport chain of the <b>mitochondria,</b> ultimately increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ROS increases uncoupling proteins (UCPs) and potentiate proton leakage through the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), the combination of which uncouples the <b>mitochondria.</b> Uncoupling then increases oxygen consumption by the <b>mitochondria,</b> compounding the increase in fatty acid oxidation. This creates a vicious cycle of uncoupling; furthermore, even though oxygen consumption increases, ATP synthesis does not increase proportionally because the <b>mitochondria</b> is uncoupled. Less ATP availability ultimately results in an energy deficit presenting as reduced cardiac efficiency and contractile dysfunction. To compound the problem, impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release and reduced mitochondrial reuptake limits peak cytosolic levels of the important signaling ion during muscle contraction. The decreased intra-mitochondrial calcium concentration increases dehydrogenase activation and ATP synthesis. So in addition to lower ATP synthesis due to fatty acid oxidation, ATP synthesis is impaired by poor calcium signaling as well, causing cardiac problems for diabetics.|$|E
5|$|The endosymbiotic {{relationship}} of <b>mitochondria</b> with their host cells was popularized by Lynn Margulis. The endosymbiotic hypothesis suggests that <b>mitochondria</b> descended from bacteria that somehow survived endocytosis by another cell, and became {{incorporated into the}} cytoplasm. The ability of these bacteria to conduct respiration in host cells that had relied on glycolysis and fermentation would have provided a considerable evolutionary advantage. This symbiotic relationship probably developed 1.7 to 2 billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{hypotheses}} {{about the origin}} of mitochondria: endosymbiotic and autogenous. The endosymbiotic hypothesis suggests that <b>mitochondria</b> were originally prokaryotic cells, capable of implementing oxidative mechanisms that were not possible for eukaryotic cells; they became endosymbionts living inside the eukaryote. In the autogenous hypothesis, <b>mitochondria</b> were born by splitting off a portion of DNA from the nucleus of the eukaryotic cell at the time of divergence with the prokaryotes; this DNA portion would have been enclosed by membranes, which could not be crossed by proteins. Since <b>mitochondria</b> have many features in common with bacteria, the endosymbiotic hypothesis is more widely accepted.|$|E
5|$|While many {{bacteria}} and <b>mitochondria</b> have polyadenylate polymerases, {{they also have}} another type of polyadenylation, performed by polynucleotide phosphorylase itself. This enzyme is found in bacteria, <b>mitochondria,</b> plastids and as a constituent of the archaeal exosome (in those archaea that have an exosome). It can synthesise a 3' extension where {{the vast majority of}} the bases are adenines. Like in bacteria, polyadenylation by polynucleotide phosphorylase promotes degradation of the RNA in plastids and likely also archaea.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{dinoflagellates}} {{are known to}} have two nuclei. Unlike other multinucleated cells these nuclei contain two distinct lineages of DNA: one from the dinoflagellate and the other from a symbiotic diatom. The <b>mitochondria</b> and the plastids of the diatom somehow remain functional.|$|E
5|$|A {{recent study}} by {{researchers}} of the University of Hawaii at Manoa and the Oregon State University indicates that the SAR11 clade of bacteria shares a relatively recent common ancestor with the <b>mitochondria</b> existing in most eukaryotic cells.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} eukaryotes, the {{inheritance}} of endosymbiotic organelles like <b>mitochondria</b> and chloroplasts in plants is non-Mendelian. Chloroplasts are inherited through the male parent in gymnosperms but often through the female parent in flowering plants.|$|E
5|$|Concurrently {{with these}} processes, the {{activity}} of <b>mitochondria</b> may be reduced, which causes cells to rely on anaerobic metabolism to produce energy, increasing levels of the byproduct lactate.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{is found}} as linear {{chromosomes}} in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. A chromosome is an organized structure consisting of DNA and histones. The set of chromosomes {{in a cell}} and any other hereditary information found in the <b>mitochondria,</b> chloroplasts, or other locations is collectively known as a cell's genome. In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is localized in the cell nucleus, or with small amounts in <b>mitochondria</b> and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its genotype.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the role}} of <b>mitochondria</b> as the cell's powerhouse, {{there may be some}} leakage of the high-energy {{electrons}} in the respiratory chain to form reactive oxygen species. This was thought to result in significant oxidative stress in the <b>mitochondria</b> with high mutation rates of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Hypothesized links between aging and oxidative stress are not new and were proposed in 1956, which was later refined into the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging. A vicious cycle was thought to occur, as oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial DNA mutations, which can lead to enzymatic abnormalities and further oxidative stress.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, it was {{discovered}} that <b>mitochondria</b> contained ribosomes. In 1968, methods were developed for mapping the mitochondrial genes, with the genetic and physical map of yeast mitochondrial DNA being completed in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Indeed, the endosymbiotic {{theory for}} {{the origin of}} organelles sees a form of {{horizontal}} gene transfer as a critical step {{in the evolution of}} eukaryotes such as fungi, plants, and animals. The endosymbiotic theory holds that organelles within the cells of eukorytes such as <b>mitochondria</b> and chloroplasts, had descended from independent bacteria that came to live symbiotically within other cells. It had been suggested in the late 19th century when similarities between <b>mitochondria</b> and bacteria were noted, but largely dismissed until it was revived and championed by Lynn Margulis in the 1960s and 1970s; Margulis was able to make use of new evidence that such organelles had their own DNA that was inherited independently from that in the cell's nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale gene {{transfer}} has also occurred between {{the ancestors of}} eukaryotic cells and bacteria, during the acquisition of chloroplasts and <b>mitochondria.</b> It is possible that eukaryotes themselves originated from horizontal {{gene transfer}}s between bacteria and archaea.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mitochondria</b> contain {{their own}} genome, an {{indication}} that they are derived from bacteria through endosymbiosis. However, the ancestral endosymbiont genome has lost most of its genes so that the mitochondrial genome {{is one of the}} most reduced genomes across organisms.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondrial genomes {{have far}} fewer genes than the {{bacteria}} {{from which they}} {{are thought to be}} descended. Although some have been lost altogether, many have been transferred to the nucleus, such as the respiratory complex II protein subunits. This is thought to be relatively common over evolutionary time. A few organisms, such as the Cryptosporidium, actually have <b>mitochondria</b> that lack any DNA, presumably because all their genes have been lost or transferred. In Cryptosporidium, the <b>mitochondria</b> have an altered ATP generation system that renders the parasite resistant to many classical mitochondrial inhibitors such as cyanide, azide, and atovaquone.|$|E
5|$|Monocercomonoides {{appear to}} have lost their <b>mitochondria</b> {{completely}} and {{at least some of}} the mitochondrial functions seem to be carried out by cytoplasmic proteins now.|$|E
5|$|One recent {{mathematical}} modeling {{study has}} suggested that the optical properties of the cristae in filamentous <b>mitochondria</b> may affect the generation and propagation of light within the tissue.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes {{have only}} one lipid bilayer- the cell {{membrane}} (also known as the plasma membrane). Many prokaryotes also have a cell wall, but the cell wall is composed of proteins or long chain carbohydrates, not lipids. In contrast, eukaryotes {{have a range of}} organelles including the nucleus, <b>mitochondria,</b> lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum. All of these sub-cellular compartments are surrounded by one or more lipid bilayers and, together, typically comprise the majority of the bilayer area present in the cell. In liver hepatocytes for example, the plasma membrane accounts for only two percent of the total bilayer area of the cell, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum contains more than fifty percent and the <b>mitochondria</b> a further thirty percent.|$|E
5|$|Some {{mitochondrial}} {{functions are}} performed only in {{specific types of}} cells. For example, <b>mitochondria</b> in liver cells contain enzymes {{that allow them to}} detoxify ammonia, a waste product of protein metabolism. A mutation in the genes regulating any of these functions can result in mitochondrial diseases.|$|E
5|$|The MAM is a {{critical}} signaling, metabolic, and trafficking hub in the cell that allows for the integration of ER and mitochondrial physiology. Coupling between these organelles is not simply structural but functional as well and critical for overall cellular physiology and homeostasis. The MAM thus offers a perspective on <b>mitochondria</b> that diverges from the traditional view of this organelle as a static, isolated unit appropriated for its metabolic capacity by the cell. Instead, this mitochondrial-ER interface emphasizes {{the integration of the}} <b>mitochondria,</b> the product of an endosymbiotic event, into diverse cellular processes.|$|E
5|$|The MAM is {{enriched in}} enzymes {{involved}} in lipid biosynthesis, such as phosphatidylserine synthase on the ER face and phosphatidylserine decarboxylase on the mitochondrial face. Because <b>mitochondria</b> are dynamic organelles constantly undergoing fission and fusion events, they require a constant and well-regulated supply of phospholipids for membrane integrity. But <b>mitochondria</b> {{are not only}} a destination for the phospholipids they finish synthesis of; rather, this organelle also {{plays a role in}} inter-organelle trafficking of the intermediates and products of phospholipid biosynthetic pathways, ceramide and cholesterol metabolism, and glycosphingolipid anabolism.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentrations}} of free calcium {{in the cell}} can regulate an array of reactions and is important for signal transduction in the cell. <b>Mitochondria</b> can transiently store calcium, a contributing process for the cell's homeostasis of calcium.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothesis}} of mitochondrial binary fission {{has relied on}} the visualization by fluorescence microscopy and conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The resolution of fluorescence microscopy(~200nm) is insufficient to distinguish structural details, such as double mitochondrial membrane in mitochondrial division or even to distinguish individual <b>mitochondria</b> when several are close together. Conventional TEM has also some technical limitations in verifying mitochondrial division. Cryo-electron tomography was recently used to visualize mitochondrial division in frozen hydrated intact cells. It revealed that <b>mitochondria</b> divide by budding.|$|E
5|$|The inner {{mitochondrial}} membrane is compartmentalized into numerous cristae, which expand {{the surface area}} of the inner {{mitochondrial membrane}}, enhancing its ability to produce ATP. For typical liver <b>mitochondria,</b> {{the area of the}} inner membrane is about five times as large as the outer membrane. This ratio is variable and <b>mitochondria</b> from cells that have a greater demand for ATP, such as muscle cells, contain even more cristae. These folds are studded with small round bodies known as F1 particles or oxysomes. These are not simple random folds but rather invaginations of the inner membrane, which can affect overall chemiosmotic function.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the endomembrane system {{is linked to the}} origin of eukaryotes {{themselves}} and the origin of eukaryoties to the endosymbiotic origin of <b>mitochondria.</b> Many models have been put forward to explain the {{origin of the}} endomembrane system (reviewed in). The most recent concept suggests that the endomembrane system evolved from outer membrane vesicles the endosymbiotic mitochondrion secreted. This OMV-based model for the origin of the endomembrane system is currently the one that requires the least amount of novel inventions at eukaryote origin and explains the many connections of <b>mitochondria</b> with other compartments of the cell.|$|E
