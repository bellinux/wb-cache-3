2500|$|During World War I, the paper's {{consistent}} antimilitarist stand {{brought it}} {{into conflict with}} the administration of President Woodrow Wilson and his Postmaster General Albert Burleson. The Leaders second class <b>mailing</b> <b>privileges</b> were withdrawn in October 1917 and the publication was banned from the United States mails, eliminating about 14,000 subscribers with one blow. In August 1918 the publication was deprived {{of the right to}} receive first class mail, with all letters from subscribers and readers sent to the publication summarily returned to sender with the envelope stamped [...] "Mail to This Address Undeliverable Under Espionage Act." [...] The paper was twice raided by the U.S. Department of Justice and subscriber records were seized.|$|E
2500|$|The Leader, as an anti-war publication, {{drew the}} ire of the Wilson {{administration}} and its Postmaster General, Albert S.

[...] Despite the attack, loyal Milwaukee readers and advertisers rallied around the paper with monetary donations and the publication survived the attack. Through it all, Work wrote extensively on anti-militarist themes including, according to his own testimony, four of the five editorials for which Victor Berger was indicted by a grand jury in Chicago in December 1918.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, {{incumbent}} {{members of}} Congress {{running for reelection}} have strong advantages over challengers. They raise more money because donors expect incumbents to win, they give their funds to them rather than challengers, and donations are vital for winning elections. One critic compared being elected to Congress to receiving life tenure at a university. Another advantage for representatives is the practice of gerrymandering. After each ten-year census, states are allocated representatives based on population, and officials in power can choose how to draw the congressional district boundaries to support candidates from their party. [...] As a result, reelection rates of members of Congress hover around 90 percent, causing some critics to accuse them of being a privileged class. Academics such as Princeton's Stephen Macedo have proposed solutions to fix gerrymandering. Both senators and representatives enjoy free <b>mailing</b> <b>privileges</b> called franking privileges.|$|E

Litten's last letter to his family, written in November 1937, spoke of the situation, adding that the Jewish prisoners were soon to be denied <b>mail</b> <b>privileges</b> until further notice. All letters from Jewish prisoners at Dachau ceased at this time.|$|R
40|$|During World War I, the {{postmaster}} general conducted a vigorous campaign {{to stop the}} distribution of radical periodicals. Victor L. Berger, the socialist publisher of the Milwaukee Leader in Wisconsin, {{was among the first}} targets. Without any court review, Berger was found in violation of the Espionage Act and the Leader’s second-class <b>mailing</b> <b>privilege</b> was revoked. As a result, mailing costs increased by a factor of seven, and circulation dropped by more than a third. Berger’s personal papers from this episode in administrative censorship only recently have become available to researchers. They reveal a principled and defiant publisher who argued he could be a critic and a patriot, and a local press contemptuous of Berger and fearful of the federal government, local censors, advertisers, and readers. </div...|$|R

50|$|After American {{intervention}} in the European World War in 1917, the International Socialist Review came under increasing pressure from the U.S. Post Office Department and United States Department of Justice. Its loss of <b>mailing</b> <b>privileges</b> {{at the hands of}} the Wilson administration's Postmaster General, Albert S. Burleson in 1917 sounded the death knell for the publication. The magazine died early in 1918, chiefly due to this government pressure. A brief attempt to revive the publication as The Labor Scrapbook under the editorship of Mary Marcy, Kerr's chief lieutenant, proved unsuccessful in 1918.|$|E
50|$|The British charged Laurens with treason, transported him to England, {{and imprisoned}} {{him in the}} Tower of London (he is the only American to have been held {{prisoner}} in the Tower). His imprisonment was protested by the Americans. In the field, most captives were regarded as prisoners of war, and while conditions were frequently appalling, prisoner exchanges and <b>mail</b> <b>privileges</b> were accepted practice. During his imprisonment, Laurens was assisted by Richard Oswald, his former business partner and the principal owner of Bunce Island. Oswald argued on Laurens' behalf to the British government. Finally, on December 31, 1781 he was released in exchange for General Lord Cornwallis and completed his voyage to Amsterdam. He helped raise funds for the American effort.|$|R
50|$|This {{established}} a pattern followed by subsequent Freedom Rides, {{most of which}} traveled to Jackson, where the Riders were arrested and jailed. Their strategy became one of trying to fill the jails. Once the Jackson and Hinds County jails were filled to overflowing, the state transferred the Freedom Riders to the infamous Mississippi State Penitentiary (known as Parchman Farm). Abusive treatment there included placement of Riders in the Maximum Security Unit (Death Row), issuance of only underwear, no exercise, and no <b>mail</b> <b>privileges.</b> When the Freedom Riders refused to stop singing freedom songs, prison officials took away their mattresses, sheets, and toothbrushes. More Freedom Riders arrived from across the country, and at one time, more than 300 were held in Parchman Farm.|$|R
50|$|Coughlin {{reasoned}} {{that although the}} government had assumed the right to regulate any on-air broadcasts, the First Amendment still guaranteed and protected freedom of the written press. He could still print his editorials without censorship in his own newspaper, Social Justice. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the US declaration of war in December 1941, the anti-interventionist movements (such as the America First Committee) rapidly lost support, and isolationists like Coughlin acquired the reputation of sympathy with the enemy. The Roosevelt Administration stepped in again. On April 14, 1942, U.S. Attorney General Francis Biddle {{wrote a letter to}} the Postmaster General, Frank Walker, and suggested the possibility of revoking the second-class <b>mailing</b> <b>privilege</b> of Social Justice, which would make it impossible for Coughlin to deliver the papers to his readers. Walker scheduled a hearing for April 29, which was later postponed until May 4.|$|R

5000|$|During the 1960s, Taylor {{acted as}} the Canadian {{representative}} of the anti-Semitic National States' Rights Party and was based at his farm at Gooderham, north of Peterborough, Ontario, where he held fascist meetings and published virulent anti-Semitic and racist literature that led Canada Post to revoke his <b>mailing</b> <b>privileges.</b> He also led his own movement with David Stanley which he called [...] "Natural Order". [...] In 1965, he was featured on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's public affairs program This Hour Has Seven Days. During his interview with CBC journalist Larry Zolf, Taylor called for Jews to be exiled to Madagascar.|$|E
5000|$|Hoping {{to reach}} new readers, Conger-Kaneko changed the magazine's name to The Progressive Woman in March 1909. The change had the desired result, and by 1910 The Progressive Woman had between 12,000 and 15,000 subscribers. Special issues sold {{as many as}} 18,000 copies. In 1910 she {{published}} a controversial issue on [...] "white slavery" [...] (forced prostitution) and nearly lost her <b>mailing</b> <b>privileges.</b> When the Appeal to Reason reorganized in 1911, she had to look elsewhere for a publisher.

5000|$|Another senior British Judge, Justice Collins, {{said of the}} {{detention}} center: [...] "America's idea of what is torture {{is not the same}} as the United Kingdom's." [...] At the beginning of December 2003, there were media reports that military lawyers appointed to defend alleged terrorists being held by the United States at Guantánamo Bay had expressed concern about the legal process for military commissions. The Guardian newspaper from the United Kingdom reported that a team of lawyers was dismissed after complaining that the rules for the forthcoming military commissions prohibited them from properly representing their clients. New York's Vanity Fair reported that some of the lawyers felt their ethical obligations were being violated by the process. The Pentagon strongly denied the claims in these media reports. It was reported on 5 May 2007, that many lawyers were sent back and some detainees refuse to see their lawyers, while others decline mail from their lawyers or refuse to provide them information on their cases (see also <b>Mail</b> <b>privileges</b> of Guantanamo Bay detainees).|$|R
5000|$|Publications in the 19th century took {{positions}} on political issues and were rarely concerned with being impartial. The JoC {{weighed in on}} the biggest issue of the day — slavery. Gerard Hallock and David Hale, partners in the JoC, were opponents of slavery but also critics of the abolitionists, and they decried the tactics of the war wing of the Republican Party.After the American Civil War broke out in 1861, the postmaster general suspended the papers <b>mail</b> <b>privileges,</b> effectively interrupting its publication, on grounds of [...] "disloyalty." [...] Hallock challenged this decision but failed to have it overturned.

5000|$|The paper {{consisted}} of defenses of weak, impoverished, and exploited {{citizens in the}} Philippines. Any critic of the current regime was able to contribute editorials to the paper, and circulation grew to 18,494 subscribers {{by the end of}} 1931. [...] The paper depended upon government-sanctioned <b>mailing</b> <b>privileges,</b> and so thus the writers were sometimes forced to avoid sensitive topics at certain tense moments at the risk of having their voices silenced completely. In addition to regularly printing criticism of officials, Sakdalistas collected donations for exiled sympathizers, boycotted foreign goods, and gave speeches at the request of various organizations in locations ranging from Pampanga to Zambales to Marinduque.|$|E
5000|$|In June 1917, {{as part of}} {{the move}} of the United States {{government}} to military conscription, so-called [...] "Espionage Act" [...] legislation was passed making the obstruction of military recruitment a crime. Mere opposition to the American war effort via public speech or the printed word was interpreted by the Wilson Administration, and affirmed by the courts, as a violation of the law and a wave of prosecutions and administrative actions followed, including action by Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson to ban offending newspapers from the mail. <b>Mailing</b> <b>privileges</b> of the New York Call were quickly revoked as part of a general offensive against the Socialist Party's press.|$|E
50|$|After {{two days}} in jail, {{the two men were}} brought to trial. The judge, looking at the two men and what they had written, said that he could not believe they were old enough, or, being black, smart enough to write that “red-hot stuff”. He did not doubt that they were being used by white socialists who had written the editorials for them. He said there would be no trial and ordered Randolph and Owen {{returned}} to their parents' homes; telling them to leave town quickly. The men continued their tour.

50|$|With {{the coming}} of American entry into World War I {{in the spring of}} 1917, {{repression}} against political dissidents and the radical labor movement became severe, with Postmaster General Albert Burleson removing the right to send opposition newspapers inexpensively via second class mail.
