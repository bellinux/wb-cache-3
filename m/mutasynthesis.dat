Recent genetic {{analysis of the}} asukamycin biosynthetic gene cluster proposed enzyme candidates related to epoxyquinone formation for manumycin-type metabolites. Our biochemical studies reveal that 3 -amino- 4 -hydroxyl benzoic acid (3, 4 -AHBA) precursor is activated and loaded on aryl carrier protein (AsuC 12) by ATP-dependent adenylase (AsuA 2). AsuE 1 and AsuE 3, both single-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases, catalyze the exquisite regio- and enantiospecific postpolyketide synthase (PKS) assembly oxygenations. AsuE 1 installs a hydroxyl group on the 3, 4 -AHB ring to form a 4 -hydroxyquinone moiety, which is epoxidized by AsuE 3 to yield the epoxyquinone functionality.

Due the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens and discovery of drug targets in cancer biology, the need for {{the discovery of}} new bioactive natural compounds and synthesis of analogs thereof remains present. Fortuitously, the development of next-generation sequencing and tools for the heterologous expression of the biosynthetic genes for natural products has accelerated the discovery of new natural products as well as the elucidation of the respective biosynthetic pathways. This dissertation describes the use of these two emerging technologies in revealing insights in the biosynthesis of two antifungal natural compounds synthesized by filamentous fungi: griseofulvin, an antifungal drug used in treatment against dermatophytes and is in the World Health Organization List of Essential Medicine and echinocandin B, the parent compound of the frontline anti-Candidiasis drug anidulafungin. This dissertation will first present the work in the investigation the biosynthesis of echinocandin B. Invasive candidiasis caused by opportunistic pathogenic strains of genus Candida, accounts for 17 % of ICU-related infections and through understanding of the biosynthesis of echinocandin B will aid in the <b>mutasynthesis</b> of analogs with better efficacy than the parent compound. In this work, we characterized the key steps in the biosynthesis of the natural product. Deletion of the biosynthetic genes also allowed for the <b>mutasynthesis</b> of echinocandin B analogs with more potent antifungal activity and showed the potential for re-engineering of the pathway to produce “unnatural” natural compounds.

40|$|This thesis focuses upon pacidamycin, {{a member}} of the uridyl peptide {{antibiotics}}, a family of antibiotics which exhibit an, as yet, clinically unexploited mode of action, against MraY. The Goss group has previously demonstrated the ease of accessing N and C-termini analogues of pacidamycin utilizing precursor directed biosynthesis. The central diamino acid is key to pacidamycin’s activity, yet little work has been carried out, to date, to investigate the SAR around this moiety. Particularly this thesis describes work toward generating pacidamycin analogues using the complementary tools of organic synthesis and biosynthesis. Chapter 1 introduces natural compounds and their importance in clinical use, provides a brief overview of the history of antibiotics and focuses on the urgent need for new antibiotics displaying new chemical architectures and possessing novel modes of action. This chapter also introduces uridyl peptide antibiotics and overviews the SAR studies around these unusual peptides, focusing on pacidamycin in particular. Diaminobutyric acid is central to these structures and a discussion of a selection of published methods to synthesis α, β-diaminobutyric acid (DABA) is also presented. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis of DABA and two analogues, in which the C-methyl moiety has been substituted by an ethyl or a cyclopropyl group. The <b>mutasynthesis</b> approach utilised in the attempt to generate novel pacidamycins and discussion around the results observes is also described. Chapter 3 demonstrates a three step one-pot reaction to access 1, 3 -disubstituted urea molecules. The chapter starts with a brief overview of previously established methods in the literature to access these useful molecules, and then moves towards a discussion about the reaction optimisation. The chapter also describes a family of analogues generated utilising this novel approach; and exploring the use of these analogues in the <b>mutasynthesis</b> of pacidamycin. In order to access the desired pacidamycin analogues with the modified diamino acid residue, it was determined that it is currently not possible to use a <b>mutasynthesis</b> approach, instead an approach of total synthesis needed to be employed. Chapter 4 describes this total synthesis. The C- terminal urea motif was generated using a novel 1 -pot phosphine free route developed during this study. To access the central native (2 S, 3 S) - DABA, a variation of the route of Merino et al’s via Garner’s aldehyde was initially utilised. Subsequently, a shorter and more flexible approach from Soloshonok et al via a Ni (II) Schiff base complex of glycine was adopted. Unpublished results from the Goss group have shown that the 2 ’, 3 ’dihydroxy uridine analogues in pacidamycin conferred broader spectra of activity. Work towards the synthesis of these analogues has been conducted. The order of assembly of the peptide and the nucleoside fragments was in alignment with Boojamra et al’s approach. If the de-protection chemistry had worked according to plan, this would have resulted with a synthesis that is at least 6 steps shorter and higher yielding then Boojamra’s. The introduction in this chapter reports the various methods previously reported in the literature for the total synthesis of pacidamycin. A discussion about the current progress in the total synthesis highlighting the difficulties faced is also shown. Chapter 5 demonstrates utilising semi-synthesis as a useful tool to generate novel pacidamycins by applying a Pictet-Spengler reaction on pacidamycin 4. This chapter starts with an overview of this phosphate mediated Pictet-Spengler reaction. In addition, a discussion about the large-scale fermentation of Streptomyces coeruleorubidus, the wild type producer of pacidamycin, and the generation of pacidamycin analogues utilising a semi-synthesis approach is also presented.

40|$|Background Understanding how complex {{antibiotics}} are synthesised {{by their}} producer bacteria {{is essential for}} creation of new families of bioactive compounds. Thiomarinols, produced by marine bacteria belonging to the genus Pseudoalteromonas, are hybrids of two independently active species: the pseudomonic acid mixture, mupirocin, which is used clinically against MRSA, and the pyrrothine core of holomycin. Methodology/Principal Findings High throughput DNA sequencing of the complete genome of the producer bacterium revealed a novel 97 kb plasmid, pTML 1, consisting almost entirely of two distinct gene clusters. Targeted gene knockouts confirmed the role of these clusters in biosynthesis of the two separate components, pseudomonic acid and the pyrrothine, and identified a putative amide synthetase that joins them together. Feeding mupirocin to a mutant unable to make the endogenous pseudomonic acid created a novel hybrid with the pyrrothine via “mutasynthesis” that allows inhibition of mupirocin-resistant isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, the mupirocin target. A mutant defective in pyrrothine biosynthesis was also able to incorporate alternative amine substrates.

In addition, these microbes generally accumulate many structurally related alkaloids making efficient prodiginine synthesis and purification difficult and expensive. Furthermore, it is known that structurally different natural prodiginine variants display differential bioactivities.

40|$|Auriculamide is {{the first}} natural product known from the predatory {{bacterium}} Herpetosiphon aurantiacus. It is composed of three unusual building blocks, including the non-proteinogenic amino acid 3 -chloro-L-tyrosine, the α-hydroxy acid L-isoleucic acid, and a methylmalonyl-CoA-derived ethane unit. A candidate genetic locus for auriculamide biosynthesis was identified and encodes four enzymes. Among them, the non-canonical 199 kDa four-domain nonribosomal peptide synthetase, AulA, is extraordinary in that it features two consecutive adenylation domains. Here, we describe the functional characterization of the recombinantly produced AulA. The observed activation of 3 -methyl- 2 -oxovaleric acid by the enzyme supports the hypothesis that it participates in the biosynthesis of auriculamide. An artificially truncated version of AulA that lacks the first adenylation domain activated this substrate like the full-length enzyme which shows that the first adenylation domain is dispensable. Additionally, we provide evidence that the enzyme tolerates structural variation of the substrate. α-Carbon substituents significantly affected the substrate turnover. While all tested aliphatic α-keto acids were accepted by the enzyme and minor differences in chain size and branches did {{not interfere with the}} enzymatic activity, molecules with methylene α-carbons led to low turnover.

Clorobiocin was the most active compound both against E. coli DNA gyrase in vitro and against bacterial growth. All tested modifications of the 3 -dimethylallyl- 4 -hydroxybenzoyl moiety reduced biological activity. The highest activities were shown by compounds containing a hydrophobic alkyl substituent at position 3 of the 4 -hydroxybenzoyl moiety.

40|$|The {{biological}} {{properties of}} the calcium-dependent antibiotics (CDAs), daptomycin and related nonribosomal lipopeptides, depend {{to a large extent}} {{on the nature of the}} N-terminal fatty acid moiety. It is suggested that the chain length of the unusually short (C 6) 2, 3 -epoxyhexanoyl fatty acid moiety of CDA is determined by the specificity of the KAS-II enzyme encoded by fabF 3 in the CDA biosynthetic gene cluster. Indeed, deletion of the downstream gene hxcO results in three new lipopeptides, all of which possess hexanoyl side chains (hCDAs). This confirms that HxcO functions as a hexanoyl-CoA or -ACP oxidase. The absence of additional CDA products with longer fatty acid groups further suggests that the CDA lipid chain is biosynthesized on a single ACP and is then transferred directly from this ACP to the first CDA peptide synthetase (CdaPS 1). Interestingly, the hexanoyl-containing CDAs retain antibiotic activity. To further modulate the biological properties of CDA by introducing alternative fatty acid groups, a <b>mutasynthesis</b> approach was developed. This involved mutating the key active site Ser residue of the CdaPS 1, module 1 PCP domain to Ala, which prevents subsequent phosphopantetheinylation. In the absence of the natural module 1 PCP tethered intermediate, it is possible to effect incorporation of different N-acyl-L-serinyl N-acetylcysteamine (NAC) thioester analogues, leading to CDA products with pentanoyl as well as hexanoyl side chains...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this project}} are to better {{understand}} the biosynthesis of CDA and then use that knowledge to genetically manipulate Streptomyces to produce novel compounds. The natural structural variants of CDA which have been characterised contain several unusual amino acids residues. CDA contains both D-figured and non-proteinogenic residues within its structure. In all of the CDA structures isolated so far, position six is occupied by a D-figured hydroxyphenylglycine residue (D- 4 -HPG). The precursor biosynthetic pathway for HPG has been elucidated in A. orientalis and it has been shown previously that the cda cluster contains homologues to these genes. A mutant strain of S. coelicolor in which the hmaS (4 -hydroxymandelic acid synthase) gene had been disrupted had previously been created and shown to be deficient in CDA production. During this study the proposed intermediates of the HPG biosynthetic pathway were fed into the mutant and CDA production re-established thus proving the pathway for HPG biosynthesis in S. coelicolor mirrors that seen in other organisms. Feeding analogues of the pathway intermediates to the mutants resulted in the <b>mutasynthesis</b> of novel lipopeptides with modified arylglycine residues. This study also identified a gene from the cda cluster, hasP, which in silico analysis predicted to encode a 3 -hydroxyasparaginyl phosphotransferase responsible for the biosynthesis of 3 -phosphohydroxyasparagine sometimes found at position nine in the CDA structure. Deletion {{of the majority of the}} gene resulted in only non-phosphorylated CDA variants being produced. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Streptorubin B is a {{structurally}} remarkable mem-ber of the prodiginine {{group of}} antibiotics produced by several actinobacteria, including the model organism Streptomyces coelicolor A 3 (2). Transannular strain within the pyrrolophane structure of this molecule causes restricted rotation that {{gives rise to}} the possibility of (diastereomeric) atropisomers. Neither the relative nor the absolute stereochemistry of streptorubin B is known. NOESY NMR experiments were used to define the relative stereochemistry of the major atropisomer of streptorubin B·HCl in solution as anti. We exploited this finding together with our knowledge of streptorubin B biosynthesis in S. coelicolor to determine the absolute stereochemistry of the anti atropisomer. 2 -Undecylpyrrole stereoselectively labeled with deuterium at C- 4 ′ was synthesized and fed to a mutant of S. coelicolor, which was unable to produce streptorubin B because it was blocked in 2 -undecylpyrrole biosynthesis, and in which the genes responsible for the last two steps of streptorubin B biosynthesis were overexpressed. 1 H and 2 H NMR analysis of the stereoselectively deuterium-labeled streptorubin B·HCl produced by this <b>mutasynthesis</b> strategy allowed us to assign the absolute stereochemistry of the major (anti) atropisomer as 7 ′S. HPLC analyses of streptorubin B isolated from S. coelicolor on a homochiral stationary phase and comparisons with streptorubin B derived from an enantioselective synthesis showed that the natural product consists of an approximately 88 : 7 : 5 mixture of the (7 ′S, anti), (7 ′S, syn), and (7 ′R, anti) stereoisomers...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-one aminocoumarin {{antibiotics}} {{derived from}} <b>mutasynthesis</b> experiments were investigated for their biological activities. Their inhibitory activities toward Escherichia coli DNA gyrase were determined {{in two different}} in vitro assays: an ATPase assay and a DNA supercoiling assay. The assays gave a similar rank order of {{the activities of the}} compounds tested, although the absolute 50 % inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) obtained in each assay were different. To confirm that the compounds also acted as gyrase inhibitors in vivo, reporter gene assays were carried out with E. coli by using gyrA and sulA promoter fusions with the luxCDABE operon. A strong induction of both promoters was observed for those compounds that showed gyrase inhibitory activity in the biochemical assays. Compounds carrying analogs of the prenylated benzoyl moiety (ring A) of clorobiocin that were structurally very different showed high levels of activity both in the biochemical assay and in the reporter gene assay, indicating that the structure of this moiety can be varied considerably without a loss of affinity for bacterial gyrase. The experimentally determined IC 50 s were compared to the binding energies calculated in silico, which indicated that a shift of the pyrrole carboxylic acid moiety from the O- 3 ″ to the O- 2 ″ position of the deoxysugar moiety has {{a significant impact on the}} binding mode of the compounds. The aminocoumarin compounds were also investigated for their MICs against different bacterial pathogens. Several compounds showed high levels of activity against staphylococci, including a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain. However, they showed only poor activities against gram-negative strains...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} work {{towards the}} biomimetic synthesis {{and understanding the}} biosynthesis of two families of natural products: prodiginines and quartromicins. Prodiginines are a large family of red pigmented tripyrrole antibiotics. Although {{they have not been}} used clinically, the promising anti-cancer, immunosuppressive and antimalarial activity they display at non-toxic doses has generated renewed interest in their utilisation. The synthesis of an analogue of the proposed pyrrole- 2 -carboxyl-RedO intermediate in prodiginine biosynthesis has been achieved. The resulting NAC thioester and analogues of it have been used to investigate the prodiginine biosynthetic pathway in Streptomyces coelicolor, and to examine the production of prodiginine analogues by <b>mutasynthesis.</b> Quartromicins, novel anti-viral antibiotics, are a structurally unique group of spirotetronate natural products produced by Amycolatopsis species. They are unusual symmetric macro cyclic compounds which possess a 32 -membered carbocyclic structure with four spirotetronic acid units connected by enone or dienone linkers in a head-to-tail fashion. These macrocyclic compounds are intriguing because they have alternating endo- and exo- spirotetronic acid units, with the opposite "comers" being identical. Although the quartromicins have therapeutic potential, very little is known about their biosynthesis. In this research a biosynthetic pathway to the quartromicins has been proposed based on hypothetical pathways to related natural products. The synthesis of the two putative key intermediates in quartromicin biosynthesis has been achieved. An improved method for the synthesis of exomethylene tetronates has been developed, and novel rearrangements have been discovered. The two putative key intermediates have been used to investigate the biomimetic synthesis of the carbon skeleton of the quartromicin algycone, and mass spectrometric evidence for formation of homo- and heterodimers, and a heterotetramer of the key intermediates has been obtained.

40|$|The prodiginines are a {{group of}} {{intensely}} red-pigmented tripyrrole compounds produced by Serratia spp., Hahella chejuensis and various actinomycetes. They are of interest due to their wide range of biological activities, including antibiotic, antitumour, immunosuppressant and anti-malarial. The proteins encoded by the red cluster, containing all of the genes required for undecylprodiginine and streptorubin B biosynthesis in Streptomyces coelicolor A 3 (2), were analysed in 2001 and putative functions for 18 of the 23 genes were assigned. A putative biosynthetic pathway to the prodiginines was also proposed. In this study, eight new mutants with genes in the red cluster replaced by an oriTaac(3) W cassette, alongside two mutants from previous studies, were used to investigate the biosynthetic pathway to the prodiginines. Two biosynthetic intermediates, 4 -methoxy- 2, 2 '-bipyrrole- 5 -carboxaldehyde (MBC) and 2 -undecylpyrrole (UP), were identified and the biosynthetic pathways to these intermediates were also studied. This was done using LC-MS analyses of acidified organic extracts of the mutants, by feeding synthetic intermediates to the mutants to observe whether prodiginine production was restored, and {{by a variety of}} cosynthesis and cross-feeding experiments. The results of these experiments were inconsistent with the previously proposed biosynthetic pathway. Using the experimental evidence obtained in this study, along with published sequence analyses of the pig cluster of Serratia spp., which directs prodigiosin biosynthesis via a common MBC intermediate, a revised complete biosynthetic pathway to the prodiginine antibiotics of S. coelicolor has been proposed. Analogues of intermediates in prodiginine biosynthesis were also synthesised and fed to the mutants {{to see if they could}} utilise modified substrates to make new prodiginine analogues. These experiments yielded natural products by <b>mutasynthesis.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Prodiginines are a {{large family}} of red-pigmented tripyrrole-based antibiotics. Their {{biosynthesis}} in Streptomyces coelicolor A 3 (2), by enzymes encoded in the red gene cluster, involves the condensation of 4 -methoxy- 2, 2 ′-bipyrrole- 5 - carboxaldehyde (MBC) and 2 -undecylpyrrole, catalysed by the RedH enzyme to give undecylprodiginine. This {{is followed by the}} mechanistically interesting oxidative carbocyclisation, catalysed by RedG to give streptorubin B. In this thesis prodiginine analogues have been generated by a mutasynthetic approach, in which chemically synthesised analogues of intermediates MBC and 2 -undecylpyrrole were fed to mutant strains of S. coelicolor in which one of the genes required to biosynthesise MBC or 2 -undecylpyrrole (redM or redL respectively) have been deleted. RedH and RedG have been shown to display relatively broad substrate tolerances and several analogues of both undecylprodiginine and streptorubin B have been generated by this approach. A variety of factors which are potentially limiting to substrate tolerances have been probed, including the steric size, alkyl chain hydrophobicity and introduction of π-electrons. The absolute stereochemistry of streptorubin B has been investigated by a mutasynthetic approach in which 2 -undecylpyrrole, stereospecifically labelled with deuterium, is fed to a mutant strain of S. coelicolor unable to biosynthesise 2 -undecylpyrrole. During the course of the investigation streptorubin B was analysed on a homochiral stationary phase HPLC and evidence of both ent- and dia-streptorubin B was discovered in the natural product isolated from S. coelicolor. When the position of the deuterium label from the <b>mutasynthesis</b> experiment was investigated by 1 H-NMR and 2 H-NMR the partial epimerization of the synthetic material became apparent. This made the definitive determination of the absolute stereochemistry of streptorubin B impossible. However, a tentative assignment of the absolute stereochemistry was possible. This was supported by comparison with the related natural products metacycloprodigiosin, the stereochemistry of which was established here by CD spectroscopy and chiral HPLC analyses, and roseophilin.

40|$|The {{chemistry}} of natural products has been remarkably {{growing in the}} past few decades in Brazil. Aspects related to the isolation and identification of new natural products, as well as their biological activities, have been achieved in different laboratories working on this subject in the country. More recently, the introduction of new molecular biology tools has strongly influenced the research on natural products, mainly those produced by microorganisms, creating new possibilities to assess the chemical diversity of secondary metabolites. This paper describes some ideas on how the research on natural products can have a considerable input from molecular biology in the generation of chemical diversity. We also explore the role of microbial natural products in mediating interspecific interactions and their relevance to ecological studies. Examples of the generation of chemical diversity are highlighted by using genome mining, <b>mutasynthesis,</b> combinatorial biosynthesis, metagenomics, and synthetic biology, while some aspects of microbial ecology are also discussed. The idea to bring up this topic is linked to the remarkable development of molecular biology techniques to generate useful chemicals from different organisms. Here, we focus mainly on microorganisms, even though similar approaches have also been applied to the study of plants and other organisms. Investigations in the frontier of chemistry and biology require interactions between different areas, characterizing the interdisciplinarity of this research field. The necessity of a real integration of chemistry and biology is pivotal to finding correct answers to a number of biological phenomena. The use of molecular biology tools to generate chemical diversity and control biosynthetic pathways is largely explored in the production of important biologically active compounds. Finally, we briefly comment on the Brazilian organization of research in this area, the necessity of new strategies for the graduation programs, and the establishment of networks as a way of organization to overcome some of the problems faced in the area of natural products.

40|$|Natural product drug {{discovery}} {{has traditionally been}} the corner stone of medicine having provided cures to many of today’s most common diseases. In particular, antibiotics have revolutionised healthcare and extended human lifespan. However, since their introduction into the clinic, resistance to these drugs has arisen. With {{the number of new}} antibiotics being discovered in recent years declining, and fewer drugs making it past clinical trials, we have reached the point where antibiotic resistant infections have become common place and a serious threat to health and society. There is now an urgent requirement for the discovery of new antibiotics and in particular those with unexploited mode of action. This thesis details the different areas of natural product drug development from discovery through to analogue generation. In Chapter one, the history of natural products as therapeutics is explored with a particular focus on antibiotics and how resistance arises against these agents. It outlines why the discovery of new antibiotics is so important and new methods used to facilitate this search. Chapter two follows with the development of a screening platform for antibiotic induction, using the model Streptomyces; Streptomyces coleiolor M 145. A variety of culture additives are explored for their ability to induce secondary metabolism production. Chapter three then details the sampling and identification of microbes from a pseudo-marine environment and their screening for their ability to produce secondary metabolites with antibiotic properties. The second half of this thesis centres on the non-ribosomal peptide echinomycin. Collaborators Aquapharm supplied the marine derived strain AQP- 4895, capable of producing echinomycin. Chapter four details the establishment of AQP- 4895 culturing conditions and the shift observed in production profile. Next Chapter five looks at producing echinomycin analogues through precursor directed biosynthesis. A range of halogenated quinoxaline carboxylic acids are synthesised and fed to AQP- 4895, and the respective echinomycin analogues monitored by LC-MS. Chapter Six then aims to direct biosynthesis of the halogenated analogues, using <b>mutasynthesis.</b> Due to the lack of genetic data available surrounding the strain, an unusual approach was taken, using iPCR to create a template for homologous recombination...|$|E
