40|$|Studies on {{the traffic}} in women have usefully {{illuminated}} {{the ways in}} which women function as objects under patriarchy; this dissertation expands that paradigm to address trafficking women — women who operate as agents, rather than objects, of exchange. The female protagonists of the plays I examine — William Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s Hamlet (1603 / 1604) and All 2 ̆ 7 s Well That Ends Well(1623), Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Nashe 2 ̆ 7 s Dido, Queen of Carthage (1594), and the anonymous Arden of Faversham (1592) — deliberately pursue relationships with men and other women to bring themselves financial and social benefit. In attending to {{the ways in which}} women are imagined to befriend, love, or lust after men and women, I focus on how women achieve and seek to achieve those affective aims, noting the key role that money and class play in enabling women to get what they want. What these women want, I argue, has not always fit comfortably with what certain strands of feminist criticism have wanted women to want. In particular, analysis guided by tenets of cultural feminism, which tends to read women as driven by desires to form close interpersonal relationships marked by egalitarianism and warmth, has stopped us from seeing these women as fully rational and has shifted attention away from the economic and political underpinnings of their affective ties. In my analysis of Hamlet and Dido, for example, I break from a tradition that has framed discussions of female rulers in terms of the queen 2 ̆ 7 s private feelings rather than public concerns, highlighting the ways in which both Gertrude and Dido exert not just sexual but also political agency. While gender is my primary category of analysis, this dissertation attests {{to the ways in which}} social class presents an equally if not more powerful force in structuring imaginative possibilities for the men and women of the Elizabethan and Jacobean stage. This is particularly clear in drama that depicts the middle-class domicile <b>and</b> its <b>master,</b> mistress <b>and</b> <b>servant</b> <b>relationships.</b> In All 2 ̆ 7 s Well, Helena 2 ̆ 7 s ability to achieve her desires, in contrast to Diana 2 ̆ 7 s almost certain failure to do the same, or, in Arden, Susan 2 ̆ 7 s inability to be innocent in Alice 2 ̆ 7 s crime exposes the limits of using female agency as a proxy for gender or social parity, for, as all the plays I examine demonstrate, personal agency invariably comes at the literal and figurative expense of others. Through analysis of these plays and other contemporary writings, this dissertation shows how early modern women are variously imagined not only to resist but also consciously to participate in, benefit from, and perpetuate gendered, economic, and social hierarchies. ...|$|R

When two companies lack the enough managerial resources to individually implement their own objectives perfectly, strategic alliances are adopted. Each company provides its own resources and conducts the business affairs in partnership to achieve both objectives {{at the same}} time. There are two characteristics of strategic alliances. The first characteristic of strategic alliances {{is that there is}} not a <b>master</b> <b>and</b> <b>servant</b> <b>relationship</b> between two companies. So one company's objectives do not have any priority over the other's objectives. Moreover, strategic alliances do not allow one company to pursue profits at the expense of the partner. The second characteristics is that the negotiation process is significant. The decision making process of strategic alliances is divided into five steps. This article discusses management accounting problems of the fifth step. In this step, companies negotiate the contents of strategic alliances. Profits will be divided according to the rate of managerial resources provided by each company. Therefore, the most important management accounting information is one which is associated with the allocation of managerial resources. I discuss the following four problems. (1) Decision making when the managerial resources are qualitative (2) The influence of corporate expenses on decision making (3) Disclosure of the premise of management accounting information (4) Possibility of changes of capacity costs...|$|E

This paper examines the economic motivation behind the criminal prosecutions of workers by employers under <b>Master</b> <b>and</b> <b>Servant</b> Law in 19 th century Britain. We construct a new panel dataset of <b>Master</b> <b>and</b> <b>Servant</b> prosecutions from 19 th century judicial statistics, and match it to county-level census characteristics. We first show that coercive labor law was widely used by employers {{well into the}} 1870 s, when it was abolished. After documenting procyclical patterns of coercion in the data, we exploit exogenous changes {{in the price of}} cotton, iron, and coal to test predictions about the effect of labor demand shocks on the incentives of employers to engage in labor market coercion. We find that sector-specific labor demand shocks increase the number of <b>Master</b> <b>and</b> <b>Servant</b> prosecutions in counties with greater employment in the affected sector, with no effect on vagrancy prosecutions, which were not prosecuted by employers. We also find weak evidence of heterogeneous effects between urban and rural sectors. Finally, we examine the effect of the 1875 abolition of <b>Master</b> <b>and</b> <b>Servant</b> on wage growth, and find that counties that had previously experienced high worker prosecutions exhibited larger wage growth in the post- 1875 period. Our results suggest that a) legal coercion of labor was compatible with Britain’s industrial, urban sectors; b) that transitory shocks to labor demand increased the use of legal coercion; and, c) coercion may be a substitute for wages in retaining labor or eliciting effort...|$|R
