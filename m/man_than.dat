5|$|Cec Linder as Felix Leiter: Bond's CIA liaison in the United States. Linder was {{the only}} actor {{actually}} on location in Miami. Linder's interpretation of Leiter {{was that of a}} somewhat older <b>man</b> <b>than</b> the way the character was played by Jack Lord in Dr. No; in reality, Linder was a year younger than Lord. According to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord demanded co-star billing, a bigger role and more money to reprise the Felix Leiter role in Goldfinger that led the producers to recast the role. At the last minute, Cec Linder switched roles with Austin Willis who played cards with Goldfinger.|$|E
5|$|The hero's inseparable {{companion}} was his powerful, talking {{piebald horse}} Šarac; Marko always {{gave him an}} equal share of his wine. The horse could leap three spear-lengths high and four spear-lengths forward, enabling Marko to capture the dangerous, elusive vila Ravijojla. She became his blood sister, promising to help him in dire straits. When Ravijojla helped him kill the monstrous, three-hearted Musa Kesedžija (who almost defeated him), Marko grieved because he had slain a better <b>man</b> <b>than</b> himself.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian {{control over}} the Faroe Islands and Shetland was strong due to the {{importance}} of Bergen as a trading centre, while Orkney, the Hebrides and Man had more natural ties with the Scottish mainland. Although traditionally having had ties with the community of Norse settlers in northern Scotland, Scottish rulers had increasingly asserted their sovereignty over the entire mainland. Haakon had at the same time gained stronger control of the Hebrides and <b>Man</b> <b>than</b> any Norwegian ruler since Magnus Barefoot. As part of a new development the Scottish king Alexander II claimed the Hebrides and requested to buy the islands from Norway, but Haakon staunchly rejected the proposals. Following Alexander II's death, his son Alexander III continued and stepped up his father's policy by sending an embassy to Norway in 1261, and thereafter attacking the Hebrides.|$|E

50|$|The health-protective {{effect of}} {{marriage}} is stronger for <b>men</b> <b>than</b> women. Marital status—the simple fact of being married—confers more health benefits to <b>men</b> <b>than</b> women.|$|R
5000|$|The {{suprachiasmatic nucleus}} of the {{hypothalamus}} was found by Swaab and Hopffman to be larger in gay <b>men</b> <b>than</b> in non-gay <b>men,</b> the suprachiasmatic nucleus is also known to be larger in <b>men</b> <b>than</b> in women.|$|R
5|$|Justice David Josiah Brewer's {{death on}} March 28, 1910 gave Taft a second {{opportunity}} {{to fill a}} seat on the high court; he chose New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes. Taft told Hughes that should the chief justiceship fall vacant during his term, Hughes would be his likely choice for the center seat. The Senate quickly confirmed Hughes, but then Chief Justice Fuller died on July 4, 1910. Taft took five months to replace Fuller, and when he did, it was with Justice Edward Douglass White, who became the first associate justice to be promoted to chief justice. According to Lurie, Taft, who still had hopes of being chief justice, may have been more willing to appoint an older <b>man</b> <b>than</b> he (White) than a younger one (Hughes), who might outlive him, as indeed Hughes did. To fill White's seat as associate justice, Taft appointed Willis Van Devanter of Wyoming, a federal appeals judge. By the time Taft nominated White and Van Devanter in December 1910, he had another seat to fill due to William Henry Moody's retirement because of illness; he named a Louisiana Democrat, Joseph R. Lamar, whom he had met while playing golf, and had subsequently learned had a good reputation as a judge.|$|E
25|$|Judaism's {{focus is}} more on how God defines <b>man</b> <b>than</b> one trying to define God. There is {{therefore}} a focus on what {{people are expected to}} be or do far more than on spelling out theological beliefs.|$|E
25|$|Flidhais asked Bricne to {{describe}} Fergus mac Róich to her. He played up to Flidhais {{knowing that she}} had a great knowledge of and interest in Fergus from tales from a long time past when Fergus had been a king in Ulster. Bricne related to Flidhais all the charms of Fergus while also telling her that he never met a better <b>man</b> <b>than</b> Oilill, Flidhais's husband.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{election}} pitting Paul Garrett against Morgan Wendell in the novel. Wendell {{is elected}} Commissioner of Resources, and Garrett reluctantly accepts his offer {{to be his}} principal deputy. The novel also portrays Morgan Wendell as a more reasonable and balanced <b>man</b> <b>than</b> what is depicted in the miniseries. It is he, not Paul Garrett, who makes the reference to Warren G. Harding as the anti-standard by which all politicians should be judged.|$|E
25|$|When Madison {{left office}} in 1817 at age 65, he retired to Montpelier, his tobacco {{plantation}} in Orange County, Virginia, {{not far from}} Jefferson's Monticello. Dolley, who thought they would finally {{have a chance to}} travel to Paris, was 49. As with both Washington and Jefferson, Madison left the presidency a poorer <b>man</b> <b>than</b> when elected. His plantation experienced a steady financial collapse, due to the continued price declines in tobacco and also due to his stepson's mismanagement.|$|E
25|$|The {{memorial}} is {{a tablet}} of black polished stone, measuring 104 x 64cm and forms {{the base for}} two white marble reliefs. The lower one {{is in the form}} of a scroll and sword and has the inscription:In Loving Memory of Lieut Thomas A Armstrong 33rd Battalion AIF who was killed in action near Passchendaele, Flanders on 12th October 1917 aged 26 years. Greater love hath no <b>man</b> <b>than</b> this.The upper white marble relief bears the crest of the 33rd Battalion in polychrome and its Latin motto, Strenue Percute (translated strike vigorously).|$|E

50|$|A 1984 {{study said}} that gay {{men tend to}} prefer gay men {{of the same age}} as ideal partners, but there was a {{statistically}} significant effect (p < 0.05) of masculinity-femininity. The study said that more feminine men tended to prefer relatively older <b>men</b> <b>than</b> themselves and more masculine men tended to prefer relatively younger <b>men</b> <b>than</b> themselves.|$|R
25|$|Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province, {{will not}} be persuaded by Liu Bei to launch an attack on Xu City, since Liu Biao {{is a person who}} does nothing but sit and talk. Liu Biao also does not trust Liu Bei as Liu Bei is a more {{competent}} <b>man</b> <b>than</b> he is — if he gives Liu Bei an important post he must be concerned that Liu Bei will become too powerful, but if he gives him a lesser position Liu Bei will be reluctant to serve him.|$|E
25|$|One {{friendship}} {{was made}} in these years that has been worth more than words can tell. I refer to that of Matthew McClung. To {{be known as a}} co-official with McClung was a privilege that only those who knew him can appreciate. I had known him before at Lehigh in his undergraduate days, and had played on the same teams with him Never was there a squarer sportsman, or a fairer, more conscientious and efficient official; nor a truer, more gallant type of real <b>man</b> <b>than</b> he. His early death took out of the game a man of the kind we can ill afford to lose and no tribute that I could pay him would be high enough.|$|E
25|$|Then Åke {{talked to}} the Swedish king, {{who was in a}} bad mood. Åke gave him {{valuable}} gifts and followed the king on the road until they came to the woods. Erik asked Åke why he, who was his man, had made such a difference between him and the Norwegian king. Åke answered that there was nothing to blame Erik for but that he had got the old things and the old hall because he was old whereas the Norwegian king was in the bloom of his youth. Åke also answered that he was no less the Swedish king's <b>man</b> <b>than</b> the Swedish king was his man. Hearing the words of treason, Erik had no other choice but to slay the impudent and treacherous Åke.|$|E
50|$|The health-protective {{effect of}} {{marriage}} is stronger for <b>men</b> <b>than</b> women. Marital status — {{the simple fact}} of being married — confers more health benefits to <b>men</b> <b>than</b> women. Women’s health is more strongly impacted than men’s by marital conflict or satisfaction, such that unhappily married women do not enjoy better health relative to their single counterparts. Laboratory studies indicate that women have stronger physiological reactions <b>than</b> <b>men</b> in response to marital conflict.|$|R
50|$|Homocysteine {{levels are}} {{typically}} higher in <b>men</b> <b>than</b> women, and increase with age.|$|R

25|$|On the {{accession}} of Ismail Pasha, Nubar Bey was in {{the prime}} of life. He was already on friendly terms with him; he even claimed to have saved his life — at all events, it was a coincidence that the two had together refused to travel by the train an accident to which caused the death (on May 14, 1858) of the prince Ahmed, who would otherwise have succeeded Said. Ismail, himself a more capable <b>man</b> <b>than</b> his immediate predecessors, at once recognized the ability of Nubar, and charged him with a mission to Constantinople, not only to notify his accession, but to smooth the way for the many ambitious projects he already entertained, notably the completion of the Suez Canal, the change in title to that of khedive and the change in the order of succession.|$|E
25|$|Various {{cultural}} and social values have historically contributed to gender disparity in education. According to work done by Denga, one prominent cultural view {{is that it is}} better for the woman to stay home and learn to tend to her family instead of attending school. To explain the fact that more boys than girls participated in education, Nigerian researcher Obasi identified a host of constraints with 'Nigerian tradition' being named as top of the list. The 'Nigerian tradition' was explained as a tradition that attaches higher value to a <b>man</b> <b>than</b> a woman, whose place {{is believed to be the}} kitchen. A study by the University of Ibadan linked the imbalance in boys' and girls’ participation in schooling was to the long-held belief in male superiority and female subordination. This situation was further aggravated by patriarchal practices which gave girls no traditional rights to succession. Therefore, the same patriarchal practices encouraged preference to be given to the education of a boy rather than a girl.|$|E
25|$|The law conferred broad investigative powers on Starr and {{the other}} {{independent}} counsels named to investigate the administration, {{including the right to}} subpoena nearly anyone who might have information relevant to the particular investigation. Starr would later receive authority to conduct additional investigations, including the firing of White House Travel Office personnel, potential political abuse of confidential FBIfiles, Madison Guaranty, Rose Law Firm, Paula Jones law suit and, most notoriously, possible perjury and obstruction of justice to cover up President Clinton's sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The Lewinsky portion of the investigation included the secret taping of conversations between Lewinsky and coworker Linda Tripp, requests by Starr to tape Lewinsky's conversations with Clinton, and requests by Starr to compel Secret Service agents to testify about what they might have seen while guarding Clinton. With the investigation of Clinton's possible adultery, critics of Starr believed that he had crossed a line and was acting more as a political hit <b>man</b> <b>than</b> as a prosecutor.|$|E

25|$|Another key {{concept in}} social {{cognition}} {{is the assumption}} that reality is too complex to easily discern. As a result, we tend to see the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality. Schemas are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. Schemas often operate automatically and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may lead us to see something that is not there. One experiment found that {{people are more likely to}} misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black <b>man</b> <b>than</b> a white man. This type of schema is actually a stereotype, a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as scripts.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Simpson asks Poirot {{to help in}} the {{investigation}} of a painting by Rubens which was stolen from the gallery that he owns. A group of unemployed men were paid to carry out a demonstration in the gallery which, once it was cleared by the police, was found to have been a diversion to enable the picture to be cut out of its frame. Simpson knows the picture is being transported to France where it will be bought by a millionaire collector and he wants Poirot to assist as he thinks he will be better at dealing with an unscrupulous rich <b>man</b> <b>than</b> the police will be. Poirot reluctantly agrees to help. He is far more interested in a case that Japp has about Winnie King, a fifteen-year-old English girl who was being escorted to Paris as one of a party of such girls for the new term at Miss Pope's exclusive school there. On the way back from the dining car of the train, just after it left Amiens (the last stop before Paris), Winnie King went into the toilet and seemingly vanished. No body has been found {{by the side of the}} tracks and the train made no other stops, only slowing down for a signal; however, Winnie's hat was later recovered near the tracks. Poirot asks if her shoes have been found.|$|E

30|$|The {{distance}} from the anterior border of the mandibular ramus to mandibular foramen {{did not differ significantly}} among the three groups, but in the group with skeletal class III malocclusion, this distance was an average of 1.43 [*]±[*] 1.95  mm longer in the <b>men</b> <b>than</b> in the women (p[*]<[*] 0.05). In the skeletal class III malocclusion group, the mandibular foramen was higher than in the other two groups and was an average of 1.85 [*]±[*] 3.23  mm higher in the <b>men</b> <b>than</b> in the women for all three groups combined (p[*]<[*] 0.05). The diameter of the ramus did not differ significantly among the three groups but was an average of 1.03 [*]±[*] 2.58  mm wider in the <b>men</b> <b>than</b> in the women for all three groups combined (p[*]<[*] 0.05).
