About half an hour later, as I was sitting on a bench sipping my take-out coffee, I glanced over at the bench next to mine and heard a woman telling stories to a young man while simultaneously weaving a <b>mat</b> from <b>strips</b> of newspaper. Twenty minutes later, this flamboyant, sixty-ish woman came up to me, or more accurately, breezed over. She (p.232-) wore two cloaks embroidered with sequins and of the color of rainbows, psychedelic spandex leggings, and a big purple hat. She smiled, revealing a gold, star-shaped filling on the front of one of her incisors. She said her name was Orunamamu, meaning [...] "Morning Star" [...] in Nigerian. She was a storyteller from Berkeley, on her way home from attending a festival in Alberta." [...] Cousineau 2002:232-3 ...|$|R
60|$|About 8 P.M., on the 9th April, a shower, {{accompanied}} by thunder and lightning, {{came up from}} the southern hills, where rain had been falling for some days, and gave notice that the Gugi or Somali monsoon had begun. This was the signal for the Bedouins to migrate to the Plateau above the hills. [6] Throughout the town the <b>mats</b> were <b>stripped</b> from their frameworks of stick and pole [7], the camels were laden, and thousands of travellers lined the roads. The next day Berberah was almost deserted except by the pilgrims who intended to take ship, and by merchants, who, fearful of plundering parties, awaited the first favourable hour for setting sail. Our protectors, Jami and Burhale, receiving permission to accompany their families and flocks, left us in charge of their sons and relations. On the 15th April the last vessel sailed out of the creek, and our little party remained in undisputed possession of the place.|$|R
50|$|The rono reed grows abundantly in {{the steep}} {{hillside}} {{of the mountains}} of the Cordilleras of central Luzon. It is used in many ways such as roofing materials, fencing material, and basketry. It is also used when lashed together as a sleeping mat to line the earthen floor in the traditional Bontoc or Ifugao house. The rono is a pencil-sized reed and most people would not find it comfortable to sleep on due to its uneveness. A softer material made of bark strips that are sewn in overlays would be prepared. But making the bark <b>strips</b> <b>mat</b> takes a long time. Sometimes it {{is used as a}} mat and sometimes it {{could be used as a}} blanket to protect one's self from the highland cold.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{accuracy}} of the coherent gravity method by using measurements reported in a large database of full-scale instrumented walls that was not available at the time the original method was developed. The new database includes data for bar mat, welded wire and steel strip soil reinforced walls. Measured reinforcement loads under operational conditions are compared with predicted values for bar <b>mat</b> and steel <b>strip</b> reinforced walls. The accuracy of the coherent gravity method as presented in the BS 8006 design standard is quantified by computing the mean and coefficient of variation of the ratio (bias) of measured to predicted loads. The paper shows that for steel strip walls the coherent gravity method is reasonably accurate for soils with friction angles less than 458. For granula...|$|R
50|$|These mats are thin, firm mats {{about twelve}} feet in length. They usually have {{alternating}} color panels {{and can be}} folded, stacked and attached to other <b>mats</b> via velcro <b>strips</b> at the ends. Normally used for practicing tumbling moves, these mats may be stacked to provide a protective surface for gymnasts working on the low balance beam, or provide a means for a gymnast to reach the bars or rings. They {{have a history of}} usage in gymnastics, martial arts and physical education classes. Schools generally purchase new folding mats once every 7 years. These mats are perfect for providing a level of protection for the body from high impact collisions with hard solid surfaces such as hardwood or concrete flooring. There are two main categories of foam used in these types of mats, cross-linked polyethylene foam and polyurethane foam.|$|R
5000|$|Within {{a year of}} its founding, {{the various}} plants of Continental Steel {{employed}} 2288 individuals, a new bar mill was in operation, and the firm was preparing to produce its first steel. Continental Steel would become at one time the largest employer in Kokomo, with a workforce approximating 3000 at its peak. In 1929 {{the construction of a}} sheet rolling plant and sheet galvanizing units at Kokomo were authorized, with production in the sheet mill beginning that summer. [...] Continental was able to surmount the rigors of the great depression of the 1930s, and in 1936 its stocks, listed on the Chicago Stock Exchange since 1929, were admitted on the New York Stock Exchange. Its earnings for 1935 had reached over one million dollars, with total assets valued at more than $18,000,000. [...] During the Second World War Continental produced large tonnages of barbed wire, nails and sheet steel for military use, and it provided material for products manufactured by defense industries. These included aerial bombs, fuel containers and landing <b>mats</b> for air <b>strips.</b>|$|R
40|$|Geotextile-mats {{constructed}} from Borassus aethiopum (Borassus Palm) and Mauritia flexuosa (Buriti Palm) leaves {{have the potential}} to decrease soil erosion. In the U. K., field experiments are being conducted on the effectiveness of palm-mats to reduce soil erosion at Hilton, east Shropshire. Twelve plots (each plot measuring 1. 0 x 1. 0 m; 6 plots were completely covered with Borassus mats, and the other 6 plots were bare) were established to study the effects of geotextile-mats on splash erosion. Eight runoff plots (10 x 1 m on a 15 o slope) were used, with duplicate treatments: (i) bare soil; (ii) grassed, (iii) bare soil with 1 m Borassus-mat buffer zones and (iv) completely covered with Borassus mats. Runoff volume and sediment yield were measured after each substantial storm from 25 / 03 / 02 - 10 / 05 / 04 (total precipitation = 1320 mm). Results indicate that palm-mats on bare soil significantly reduced total soil splash erosion by ~ 50 % compared with bare soil (34. 2 g m- 2; during 10 / 06 / 02 - 09 / 02 / 04, total precipitation = 1038 mm). Total runoff from bare plots was 3. 58 litres m- 2 and total sediment yield was 8. 58 g m- 2. Borassus <b>mats</b> as buffer <b>strips</b> reduced runoff by ~ 36 % and soil erosion by ~ 57 %. Total soil loss from the completely covered plots was only ~ 16 % less than the buffer zone plots. To confirm the results, another set of runoff experiments are in progress at Hilton, with one additional treatment (bare soil with 1 m Buriti-mat buffer zones) compared with the earlier experiment.

6000|$|Here, {{as among}} most savage people I have dwelt among, I was {{delighted with the}} beauty of the human form-a beauty of which stay-at-home civilized people can {{scarcely}} have any conception. What are the finest Grecian statues to the living, moving, breathing men I saw daily around me? The unrestrained grace of the naked savage as he goes about his daily occupations, or lounges at his ease, must be seen to be understood; and a youth bending his bow is the perfection of manly beauty. The women, however, except in extreme youth, are by no means so pleasant to look at as the men. Their strongly-marked features are very unfeminine, and hard work, privations, and very early marriages soon destroy whatever of beauty or grace they may for a short time possess. Their toilet is very simple, but also, I am sorry to say, very coarse, and disgusting. It consists solely of a <b>mat</b> of plaited <b>strips</b> of palm leaves, worn tight round the body, and reaching from the hips to the knees. It seems not to be changed till worn out, is seldom washed, and is generally very dirty. This is the universal dress, except in a few cases where Malay [...] "sarongs" [...] have come into use. Their frizzly hair is tied in a bench {{at the back of the}} head. They delight in combing, or rather forking it, using for that purpose a large wooden fork with four diverging prongs, which answers the purpose of separating and arranging the long tangled, frizzly mass of cranial vegetation much better than any comb could do. The only ornaments of the women are earrings and necklaces, which they arrange in various tasteful ways. The ends of a necklace are often attached to the earrings, and then looped on to the hair-knot behind. This has really an elegant appearance, the beads hanging gracefully on each side of the head, and by establishing a connexion with the earrings give an appearance of utility to those barbarous ornaments. We recommend this style to the consideration of those of the fair sex who still bore holes in their ears and hang rings thereto. Another style of necklace among these Papuan belles is to wear two, each hanging on one side of the neck and under the opposite arm, so as to cross each other. This has a very pretty appearance, in part due to the contrast of the white beads or kangaroo teeth of which they are composed with the dark glossy skin. The earrings themselves are formed of a bar of copper or silver, twisted so that the ends cross. The men, as usual among savages, adorn themselves more than the women. They wear necklaces, earrings, and finger rings, and delight in a band of plaited grass tight round the arm just below the shoulder, to which they attach a bunch of hair or bright coloured feathers by way of ornament. The teeth of small animals, either alone, or alternately with black or white beads, form their necklaces, and sometimes bracelets also. For these latter, however, they prefer brass wire, or the black, horny, wing-spines of the cassowary, which they consider a charm. Anklets of brass or shell, and tight plaited garters below the knee, complete their ordinary decorations.|$|R
