50|$|As in <b>Mucolipidosis</b> II, <b>Mucolipidosis</b> III {{results from}} genetic defects in GlcNAc {{phosphotransferase}} (N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase). However, ML III produces less severe symptoms and progresses more slowly, {{probably because the}} defect in GlcNAc phosphotranspherase lies in its protein recognition domain. Therefore, the catalytic domain retains some of its activity, resulting in a smaller accumulation of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins in the inclusion bodies.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mucolipidosis</b> type IV is {{severely}} under-diagnosed. It is often misdiagnosed as cerebral palsy. In the Ashkenazi Jewish population {{there are two}} severe mutations with a higher carrier frequency of 1:90 to 1:100.|$|E
50|$|I-cells {{also called}} {{inclusion}} cells are abnormal fibroblasts having {{a large number}} of dark inclusions in the cytoplasm of the cell (mainly in the central area). The inclusions are of various fats, proteins, carbohydrates, pigments and other insolubles.They are seen in <b>mucolipidosis</b> II.|$|E
50|$|Ashkenazi Jews {{are also}} highly {{affected}} by other lysosomal storage diseases, {{particularly in the}} form of lipid storage disorders. Compared to other ethnic groups, they more frequently act as carriers of <b>mucolipidosis</b> and Niemann-Pick disease, the latter of which can prove fatal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mucolipidosis</b> types II and III (ML II and ML III) {{result from}} a {{deficiency}} of the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase, which phosphorylates target carbohydrate residues on N-linked glycoproteins.

50|$|Pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy, also {{referred}} to as <b>mucolipidosis</b> III (ML III), is a lysosomal storage disease closely related to I-cell disease (ML II). This disorder is called Pseudo-Hurler because it resembles a mild form of Hurler syndrome, one of the mucopolysaccharide (MPS) diseases.|$|E
50|$|TRPML1 is a 65 kDa protein {{associated}} with <b>mucolipidosis</b> type IV. Its predicted structure includes six transmembrane domains, a transient receptor potential (TRP) cation-channel domain, and an internal channel pore. TRPML1 {{is believed to}} channel iron ions across the endosome/lysosome membrane into the cell and so its malfunction causes cellular iron deficiency.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{specific}} treatment to this disorder. However, several symptoms may be alleviated. For instance, anemia is treated by iron supplements. Some {{of the movement}} deficiencies may be corrected with orthopedic intervention. The corneal clouding can be, at least, temporarily corrected by corneal transplantation.See the equivalent section in the main <b>mucolipidosis</b> article.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mucolipidosis</b> type I (ML I) or sialidosis is an {{inherited}} lysosomal storage disease {{that results from}} a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-N -acetyl neuraminidase (sialidase). The lack of this enzyme results in an abnormal accumulation of complex carbohydrates known as mucopolysaccharides, and of fatty substances known as mucolipids. Both of these substances accumulate in bodily tissues.|$|E
50|$|When {{originally}} named, the mucolipidoses derived {{their name}} from the similarity in presentation to both mucopolysaccharidoses and sphingolipidoses. A biochemical understanding of these conditions has changed how they are classified. Although four conditions (I, II, III, and IV) have been labeled as mucolipidoses, type I (sialidosis) is now classified as a glycoproteinosis, and type IV (<b>Mucolipidosis</b> type IV) is now classified as a gangliosidosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mucolipidosis</b> type IV (ML IV or ML4) is an {{autosomal}} recessive lysosomal storage disorder. Individuals with the disorder have many symptoms including delayed psychomotor development and various ocular aberrations. The disorder {{is caused by}} mutations in the MCOLN1 gene, which encodes a non-selective cation channel, mucolipin1. These mutations disrupt cellular functions and lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder through an unknown mechanism. Researchers dispute the physiological role of the protein product and which ion it transports.|$|E
5000|$|The cherry {{red spot}} {{is seen in}} central retinal artery occlusion, {{appearing}} several hours after the blockage of the retinal artery occurs. [...] The cherry red spot is seen because the macula receives its blood supply from the choroid, supplied by the posterior ciliary arteries, while the surrounding retina is pale due to retinal artery infarction. It is also seen in several other conditions, classically Tay-Sachs disease, but also in Niemann-Pick disease, Sandhoff disease, and <b>mucolipidosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{final chapter}} of The 10,000 Year Explosion expands on their {{paper from the}} Journal of Biosocial Science {{on the issue of}} Ashkenazi Jewish intelligence. Harpending and Cochran argue the cause of the claim of Ashkenazim having higher mean verbal and {{mathematical}} intelligence than other ethnic groups (as well as having a relatively high number of genetic diseases, such as Tay-Sachs Disease, Canavan, Niemann-Pick, Gaucher, Familial Dysautonomia, Bloom Syndrome, Fanconi anemia, Cystic Fibrosis and <b>Mucolipidosis</b> IV) is due to the historically isolated population of Jews in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Dor Yeshorim, {{a program}} {{which seeks to}} reduce the {{incidence}} of Tay-Sachs disease, cystic fibrosis, Canavan disease, Fanconi anemia, familial dysautonomia, glycogen storage disease, Bloom's Syndrome, Gaucher disease, Niemann-Pick disease, and <b>mucolipidosis</b> IV among certain Jewish communities, is another screening program which has drawn comparisons with liberal eugenics. In Israel, {{at the expense of the}} state, the general public is advised to carry out genetic tests to diagnose these diseases early in the pregnancy. If a fetus is diagnosed with one of these diseases, among which Tay-Sachs is the most commonly known, the pregnancy may be terminated, subject to consent.|$|E
50|$|Prenatal {{testing for}} several genetic {{diseases}} is offered as commercial panels for Ashkenazi couples by both CIGNA and Quest Diagnostics. The CIGNA panel {{is available for}} testing for parental/preconception screening or following chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis and tests for Bloom syndrome, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, familial dysautonomia, Fanconi anemia, Gaucher disease, <b>mucolipidosis</b> IV, Neimann-Pick disease type A, Tay-Sachs disease, and torsion dystonia. The Quest panel is for parental/preconception testing and tests for Bloom syndrome, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, familial dysautonomia, Fanconi anemia group C, Gaucher disease, Neimann-Pick disease types A and B and Tay-Sachs disease.|$|E
50|$|In {{autoimmune}} gastritis, {{the immune}} system attacks the parietal cells leading to hypochlorhydria (low stomach acid secretion). This results in an elevated gastrin level {{in an attempt to}} compensate for increased pH in the stomach. Eventually, all the parietal cells are lost and achlorhydria results leading to a loss of negative feedback on gastrin secretion. Plasma gastrin concentration is elevated in virtually all individuals with <b>mucolipidosis</b> type IV (mean 1507 pg/mL; range 400-4100 pg/mL) (normal 0-200 pg/mL) secondary to a constitutive achlorhydria. This finding facilitates the diagnosis of patients with this neurogenetic disorder. Additionally, elevated gastrin levels may be present in chronic gastritis resulting from H pylori infection.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a blanket}} term that {{encompasses}} {{a spectrum of}} acidic vesicles that include endosomes, lysosomes, and lysosome-related organelles and secretory vesicles and acidocalcisomes. They are a highly dynamic continuum of vesicles with a rich variety of established biochemical roles in cells, to which Ca2+ storage can now be added. Their luminal pH is one characteristic that distinguishes a given vesicle class from another: where endosomes are weakly acidic (pH 6-6.5), lysosomes are typically the most acidic (pH 4.5-5.0) and secretory vesicles are typically pH 5.5. Ca2+ is seen to be increasingly important for endo-lysosomal function, e.g. trafficking and autophagy. Aberrations in Ca2+ signals can have pathophysiological consequences, including lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann Pick C and <b>Mucolipidosis</b> IV.|$|E
5000|$|Inclusion-cell (I-cell) disease, also {{referred}} to as <b>mucolipidosis</b> II (ML II), is part of the lysosomal storage disease family and results from a defective phosphotransferase (an enzyme of the Golgi apparatus). This enzyme transfers phosphate to mannose residues on specific proteins, and serves as a marker for them to be targeted to lysosomes within the cell. Without this marker, the proteins are instead excreted outside the cell—the default pathway for proteins moving through the Golgi apparatus. Lysosomes cannot function without these proteins, which function as catabolic enzymes for the normal breakdown of substances (e.g. oligosaccharides, lipids, and glycosaminoglycans) [...] in various tissues throughout the body (i.e. fibroblasts). As a result, a buildup of these substances occurs within lysosomes because they cannot be degraded, resulting in the characteristic I-cells, or [...] "inclusion cells." [...] These cells can be identified under the microscope. In addition, the defective lysosomal enzymes normally found only within lysosomes are instead found in high concentrations in the blood.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mucolipidosis</b> II (ML II) is a {{particularly}} severe form of ML that has a significant resemblance to another mucopolysaccharidoses called Hurler syndrome. Generally only laboratory testing can distinguish the two as the presentation is so similar. There are high plasma levels of lysosomal enzymes and are often fatal in childhood. Typically, {{by the age of}} 6 months, failure to thrive and developmental delays are obvious symptoms of this disorder. Some physical signs, such as abnormal skeletal development, coarse facial features, and restricted joint movement, may be present at birth. Children with ML II usually have enlargement of certain organs, such as the liver (hepatomegaly) or spleen (splenomegaly), and sometimes even the heart valves. Affected children often have stiff claw-shaped hands and fail to grow and develop in the first months of life. Delays in the development of their motor skills are usually more pronounced than delays in their cognitive (mental processing) skills. Children with ML II eventually develop a clouding on the cornea of their eyes and, because of their lack of growth, develop short-trunk dwarfism (underdeveloped trunk). These young patients are often plagued by recurrent respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, otitis media (middle ear infections), bronchitis and carpal tunnel syndrome. Children with ML II generally die before their seventh year of life, often as a result of congestive heart failure or recurrent respiratory tract infections.|$|E
50|$|Disease and Disorders: NUMT {{insertion}} {{into the}} genome can be problematic. Transposition of NUMTs into genome {{has also been}} associated with human diseases. De novo integration of NUMT pseudogenes into the nuclear genome has an adverse effect in some cases, promoting various disorders and aging. MtDNA integration into coding genes in the germline cells has dramatic consequences for embryo development and, in many cases, is lethal. Few NUMT pseudogenes associated with diseases are found within exons or at the exon-intron boundaries of human genes. For example, the patients with <b>mucolipidosis</b> syndrome inherit a mutation caused by insertion of a 93bp fragment of mitochondrial ND5 into exon 2 of the R403C mucolipin gene. This is the first case of a heritable disorder due to the NUMT insert. Despite the small treatment group, Stem Cell transplant found to be effective and lysosomal enzyme levels seemed to normalize after transplant {{in at least one}} case. The Pallister-Hall syndrome, a developmental disorder, in another example, where a functional disorder of a key developmental gene results from a de novo insertion of a 72bp mtDNA fragment into GLI3 exon 14 in chromosome 7, which results in central and postaxial polydactyly, bifid epiglottis, imperforate anus, renal abnormalities including cystic malformations, renal hypoplasia, ectopic ureteral implantation, and pulmonary segmentation anomalies such as bilateral bilobed lungs. A splice site mutation in the human gene for plasma factor VII that causes severe plasma factor VII deficiency, bleeding disease, results from a 251-bp NUMT insertion. As the last known example, a 36-bp insertion in exon 9 of the USH1C gene associated with Usher syndrome type IC is the NUMT. No certain curse has yet found for Usher syndrome, however, a current clinical study on 18 volunteers is taking place to determine the influence of UshStat both in a short and a long-term period. This study has been started in September 2013 and is estimated to be done by October 2023.|$|E

40|$|Normal N-acetylglucosamine 1 -phosphotransferase {{activity}} toward mono- and oligosaccharide acceptor substrates {{was detected}} in cultured skin fibroblasts from mucolipidoses II and III {{patients who were}} designated as variants (one of four <b>mucolipidosis</b> II and three out of six <b>mucolipidosis</b> III patients examined). The activity toward natural lysosomal protein acceptors was absent or deficient in cell preparations from all patients with classical as well as variant forms of mucolipidoses II and III. Complementation analysis, using fused and cocultivated mutant fibroblast combinations, revealed that, while cell lines with variant <b>mucolipidosis</b> III constituted a complementation group distinct from that of classical forms of mucolipidoses II and III, the variant <b>mucolipidosis</b> II cell line belonged to the same complementation group as did the classical forms. In contrast to the mutant enzyme from variant <b>mucolipidosis</b> III patients that failed to recognize lysosomal proteins as the specific acceptor substrates, the activity toward alpha-methylmannoside in the variant <b>mucolipidosis</b> II patient could be inhibited by exogenous lysosomal enzyme preparations (bovine beta-glucuronidase and human hexosaminidase A). These findings suggest that N-acetylglucosamine 1 -phosphotransferase is composed {{of at least two}} distinct polypeptides: (1) a recognition subunit that is defective in the <b>mucolipidosis</b> III variants and (2) a catalytic subunit that is deficient or altered in the classical forms of mucolipidoses II and III {{as well as in the}} <b>mucolipidosis</b> II variant...|$|E

40|$|Protein {{catabolism}} in fibroblasts cultured {{from the}} skin of normal individuals and of patients with <b>mucolipidosis</b> II (I-cell disease) and several other lysosomal storage diseases was examined by metabolic labelling with [3 H]leucine and following the fate of radioactive proteins in pulse-chase experiments. In <b>mucolipidosis</b> II cells, overall protein degradative rates {{were found to be}} distinctly lower than in normal control cells. To distinguish lysosomal from non-lysosomal degradation, labelling experiments were carried out in the presence and absence of 10 mM NH 4 Cl, an inhibitor of lysosomal function. It was found that <b>mucolipidosis</b> II fibroblasts exhibited a markedly reduced rate of lysosomal protein degradation, whereas the rate of nonlysosomal degradation appeared normal. Serum and amino acid starvation led to a marked increase in lysosomal protein degradation in normal cells, but had only a minimal effect on that in <b>mucolipidosis</b> II fibroblasts. The specific activities of cathepsins B, H and L were profoundly diminished in all <b>mucolipidosis</b> II cell lines tested. Lysosomal protein degradation in a <b>mucolipidosis</b> III cell line was impaired to a similar degree as in <b>mucolipidosis</b> II cells, whereas it was decreased to a lesser extent in fibroblasts from patients with mucopolysaccharidoses I and VI, galactosialidosis and GM 1 -gangliosidosis. We conclude that fibroblasts from patients with <b>mucolipidosis</b> II and III have a severely compromised capacity for endogenous lysosomal protein degradation that appears to result from multiple cathepsin deficiency. This lysosomal defect is likely to have pathophysiological consequences...|$|E
