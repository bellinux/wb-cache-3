50|$|Heisler {{once had}} his White House {{photographer}} privileges revoked {{after taking a}} photograph of President George H.W.

His press secretary <b>Marlin</b> <b>Fitzwater</b> later wrote about his own anger in Call the Briefing! (He discussed how upset he was in an interview in 1995 with Brian Lamb on C-SPAN's Booknotes.) Heisler's trade group protested the ban because it was based on an editorial opinion that was expressed. Heisler has since taken photographs of President George W. Bush.|$|E

The following day, the White House delivered to the committee hundreds of other such files related to White House employees of the Reagan Administration and George H. W. Bush Administration, for which Craig Livingstone, director of the White House's Office of Personnel Security, had improperly requested and received background reports from the FBI in 1993 and 1994, without asking permission of the subject individuals.Estimates ranged from 400 to 700 to 900 unauthorized file disclosures. The incident caused an intense burst of criticism {{because many of the}} files covered White House employees from previous Republican administrations, including top figures such as James Baker, Brent Scowcroft, and <b>Marlin</b> <b>Fitzwater.</b>|$|E
5000|$|However, in a 1989 {{report on}} El Salvador, Human Rights Watch {{noted that the}} Casolo arrest {{came at a time}} when the Salvadoran police and army were arresting, jailing and {{expelling}} foreigners working with Salvadoran churches and relief organizations. These critics stated their belief that the government used the Casolo incident as part of an effort to threaten and discredit the entire foreign religious community in El Salvador. They also expressed their concern that it appeared to them that the U.S. Embassy staff in San Salvador and officials in Washington appeared to have already accepted the Salvadoran military's view that Casolo's guilt was an established fact. On November 27, 1989, White House spokesman <b>Marlin</b> <b>Fitzwater</b> stated that [...] "there are indications of her involvement, that's for certain". Faced with criticism [...] for what appeared to be a bias towards Casolo, Fitzwater apologized [...] "to anyone who feels that they were offended by this." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bush's broken promise was one {{of several}} {{important}} factors leading to Bush's defeat. In fact, conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh in his book See I Told You So, believes Bush would have easily won re-election had he not increased taxes. Republican pollster Richard Wirthlin called his promise [...] "the six most destructive words in the history of presidential politics." [...] Ed Rollins has called it [...] "probably the most serious violation of any political pledge anybody has ever made." [...] White House Press Secretary <b>Marlin</b> <b>Fitzwater</b> called the reversal the [...] "single biggest mistake of the administration." [...] Others disagree with this view. Richard Darman does not believe that the reversal {{played a central role in}} Bush's defeat; rather he argues that it simply became a focal point for discontent with an economic situation that Bush had little control over. Others feel that the reversal was politically disastrous, but also good for the country. Daniel L. Ostrander has argued that Bush's actions should be seen as a noble sacrifice of his own political future for the good of the nation's well-being.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the years}} prior to this merger, CSX donated the C&O desk to the White House and it {{was placed in the}} Oval Office Study. Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan all used the desk there. On May 2, 1985 the desk was moved, and then Vice President George H. W. Bush started using the desk as his main work space in the White House. When <b>Marlin</b> <b>Fitzwater,</b> White House Press Secretary under both presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, was asked about Bush's use of the C&O desk, he stated that [...] "...he got used to it, found it comfortable, and thought it was attractive." [...] After his p{{residential}} inauguration on January 20, 1989 the C&O desk was used in the residential portion of the White House, and on June 13, 1989 it was moved into the newly decorated Oval Office. The Resolute desk, the Oval Office desk removed for the C&O, was placed briefly in the White House storage room, but found a final resting place for the Bush White House in the Treaty Room which Bush used as an ancillary office.|$|E
5000|$|Speakes {{wrote in}} his 1988 memoir Speaking Out that he twice invented {{statements}} himself and attributed them to President Reagan. These statements included ones after the KAL 007 shootdown in 1983 and during the Geneva Summit of 1985. Speakes thought that Gorbachev's remarks at the summit had been highly quotable while Reagan's were [...] "disappointingly lackluster", so he asked his aides to make up some quotes, polished them himself, then issued them to the press as President Reagan's statements. Speakes' revelations, something of a side note in the book, touched off a minor controversy; reporters were annoyed at having been fooled, and <b>Marlin</b> <b>Fitzwater,</b> Speakes's successor, called it a [...] "damn outrage" [...] and complained that they unfairly called into question the veracity of other presidential statements. Speakes said [...] "I was representing his thought if not his words", but also apologized to Reagan, saying he had [...] "provided fodder {{for those who would}} aim the cannons of criticism at the President I served loyally for 6 years." [...] Speakes left a job at Merrill Lynch which he had held for a short time {{as a result of the}} controversy.|$|E
