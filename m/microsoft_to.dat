5|$|Acid2 was {{designed}} with Microsoft Internet Explorer particularly in mind. The creators of Acid2 were dismayed that Internet Explorer {{did not follow}} web standards. It was prone to display web pages differently from other browsers, causing web developers to spend time tweaking their web pages. Acid2 challenged <b>Microsoft</b> <b>to</b> make Internet Explorer comply with web standards.|$|E
5|$|As {{they share}} many {{cross-platform}} games and {{compete for the}} same audience as their predecessors, frequent comparisons are made between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The PS3 uses the Blu-ray format, while the Xbox 360 uses a standard DVD9. The Xbox 360 is less expensive to produce, and analysts expect that a mid-revision will allow <b>Microsoft</b> <b>to</b> break-even on manufacturing costs, while industry consensus is that the Xbox 360's conventional architecture is easier to develop for.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, a {{privilege}} escalation exploit {{was discovered in}} the Windows kernel that can allow unsigned code to run under Windows RT; the exploit involved {{the use of a}} remote debugging tool (provided by <b>Microsoft</b> <b>to</b> debug WinRT apps on Windows RT devices) to execute code which changes the signing level stored in RAM to allow unsigned code to execute (by default, it is set to a level that only allows code signed by <b>Microsoft</b> <b>to</b> execute). Alongside his explanation of the exploit, the developer also included a personal appeal to Microsoft urging them to remove the restrictions on Windows RT devices, contending that their decision was not for technical reasons, and that the devices would be more valuable if this functionality were available. In a statement, a Microsoft spokesperson applauded the effort, indicating that the exploit does not pose a security threat because it requires administrative access to the device, advanced techniques, and would still require programs to be re-compiled for ARM. However, Microsoft has still indicated that the exploit would be patched in a future update.|$|E

Although Rovio asked <b>Microsoft</b> <b>to</b> revise its site to remove references to the game, a Windows Phone version was ultimately released in June 2011.|$|E
5|$|The first Halo book, , {{sold more}} than 1,000,000 copies and {{prompted}} an extended agreement between Del Rey Books and <b>Microsoft</b> <b>to</b> produce more Halo novels. William C.

5|$|Acid2 {{was first}} {{proposed}} by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie, {{chief technical officer}} of Opera Software and creator of the widely used Cascading Style Sheets web standard. In a 16 March 2005 article on CNET, Lie expressed dismay that Microsoft Internet Explorer did not properly support web standards and hence was not completely interoperable with other browsers. He announced that Acid2 would be a challenge to <b>Microsoft</b> <b>to</b> design Internet Explorer 7, then in development, to achieve {{a greater degree of}} standards compliance than previous versions of Internet Explorer. The original Acid1 test had forced browser makers to fix their applications or face embarrassment; Lie hoped that Acid2 would do the same.|$|E
5|$|Adoption of Snapdragon {{contributed to}} Qualcomm's {{transition}} from a wireless modem company to one that also produces {{a wider range of}} hardware and software for mobile devices. In July 2011 Qualcomm acquired certain assets from GestureTek in order to incorporate its gesture recognition intellectual property into Snapdragon SoCs. In mid-2012 Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon software development kit (SDK) for Android devices at the Uplinq developer conference. The SDK includes tools for facial recognition, gesture recognition, noise cancellation and audio recording. That November Qualcomm acquired some assets from EPOS Development in order to integrate its stylus and gesture recognition technology into Snapdragon products. It also collaborated with <b>Microsoft</b> <b>to</b> optimize Windows Phone 8 for Snapdragon semiconductors.|$|E

5|$|On February 9, 2006, Nick Baron {{announced}} that a version of Halo 2 would be released on PC, exclusively for the Windows Vista operating system. While this was a deliberate decision by <b>Microsoft</b> <b>to</b> push sales of Vista, the game could be enabled to play on Windows XP through an unauthorized third-party patch. The game was ported by a small team at Microsoft Game Studios (codenamed Hired Gun) who worked closely with Bungie. As one of the launch titles of Games for Windows â Live, the game offered Live features not available in the Xbox version, such as guide support and achievements.

5|$|Star Fox Adventures is an action-adventure video game, {{developed}} by Rare {{and published by}} Nintendo. Although the game's original concept was intended for the Nintendo 64, Shigeru Miyamoto convinced Rare to re-design the game to be both {{a part of the}} Star Fox series and as a launch title for the GameCube. The game was released on 23 September 2002, and was the final Nintendo game that Rare developed, before it was acquired by <b>Microsoft</b> <b>to</b> be a part of its Xbox division the day after the game's release in North America. The game's story takes place after the events of Star Fox 64, in which players take control of Fox McCloud who is sent on a mission to visit a planet in the Lylat System and save it from destruction.|$|E
5|$|The {{compilation}} was one {{of several}} ideas Rare considered to celebrate its 30th anniversary. Inspired by fans, upcoming Xbox One backward compatibility features, and a desire to link Rare's past and future, the company sorted through 120 games to choose titles that best represented its oeuvre. It prioritized games with characters and environments original to the company. Rare incorporated six hardware emulators in the package, and worked with its parent company, <b>Microsoft,</b> <b>to</b> use its unannounced Xbox 360 emulation. Rare Replay released worldwide as an Xbox One exclusive on August 4, 2015.|$|E
5|$|According to Microsoft sources, BitLocker {{does not}} contain an {{intentionally}} built-in backdoor; without a backdoor {{there is no way}} for law enforcement to have a guaranteed passage to the data on the user's drives that is provided by Microsoft. In 2006 the UK Home Office expressed concern over the lack of a backdoor and tried entering into talks with <b>Microsoft</b> <b>to</b> get one introduced, although Microsoft developer Niels Ferguson and other Microsoft spokesmen state that they will not grant the wish to have one added. Microsoft engineers have said that FBI agents also put pressure on them in numerous meetings in order to add a backdoor, although no formal, written request was ever made; Microsoft engineers eventually suggested to the FBI that agents should look for the hard-copy of the key that the BitLocker program suggests its users to make. Although the AES encryption algorithm used in BitLocker is in the public domain, its implementation in BitLocker, as well as other components of the software, are proprietary; however, the code is available for scrutiny by Microsoft partners and enterprises, subject to a non-disclosure agreement.|$|E
