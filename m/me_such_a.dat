I can only say: even in death they cannot stop lying. I have {{in the course of}} my political struggle won much love from my people, but when I crossed the former frontier (into Austria) there met <b>me</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> stream of love as I have never experienced. Not as tyrants have we come, but as liberators." ...|$|E

500|$|Of Rambles, Mary Shelley {{wrote to}} her friend Leigh Hunt: [...] "It seems to <b>me</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> wretched piece of work, written {{much of it in}} a state of pain that makes me look at its pages now as if written in a dream." [...] She disliked the work, {{describing}} it variously as [...] "a poor affair" [...] and [...] "my poor book", and claimed that Gatteschi had written the best parts. There are no statistics on the sales of the book, but it received at least seventeen reviews. In general, the reviews were favourable; as Moskal explains, [...] "with nationalist movements simmering in Europe, to culminate in the revolutions of 1848, reviewers took Rambles seriously as a political as well as a literary endeavour." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 1893 Busoni {{was present}} at the Berlin premiere of Giuseppe Verdi's opera Falstaff. The result was to force on him a re-evaluation of the {{potential}} of Italian musical traditions which he had so far ignored in favour of the German traditions, and in [...] particular the models of Johannes Brahms and the orchestral techniques of Liszt and Richard Wagner. He immediately began to draft an adulatory letter to Verdi (which he never summoned the courage to send), in which he addressed him as [...] "Italy's leading composer" [...] and [...] "one of the noblest persons of our time", and in which he explained that [...] "Falstaff provoked in <b>me</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> revolution of spirit that I can... date {{the beginning of a new}} epoch in my artistic life from that time." ...|$|E

However, the tweet was shortly deleted and replaced with another clarifying that more information will be given on September 13. In an interview with iHeartRadio at their annual music festival in September, Rihanna confirmed [...] "Diamonds" [...] as her new single and {{said that it would}} first be played on American radio beginning September 26. She described it as an easy-going, but optimistic song that is [...] "happy and hippy" [...] rather than dance-oriented and said that the song [...] "gives <b>me</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> great feeling when I listen to it.

500|$|Billingsley's {{generosity}} was {{not confined}} {{to those who were}} always at the club. [...] He received the following letter in 1955: [...] "I am grateful to you for your thoughtful kindness in sending <b>me</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> generous selection of attractive neckties. At the same time may I once again thank you for the cigars that you regularly send to the White House." [...] It was signed by Dwight D. Eisenhower. During World War II, three bomber planes were christened with the name of the Stork Club. [...] Billingsley commissioned Tiffany & Co. to produce sterling silver Stork Club logo Victory pins as gifts for their crew members. Patrons were not always on the receiving end; Billingsley's writings claimed that one of his waiters received a $20,000 tip. [...] A bartender received a new Cadillac from a grateful patron, and a headwaiter received a $10,000 tip from tennis star Fred Perry. It was necessary for Billingsley to give the expensive gifts and to provide some or all of a celebrity's Stork Club services for free to bring the stars to the club and keep them coming back. The notables were what brought {{people from all over the}} country in all walks of life to visit the Stork Club.|$|E

500|$|The first {{performances}} {{outside the}} Kingdom of Italy were in Trieste and Vienna, in May 1893. The work {{was given in}} the Americas and across Europe. The Berlin premiere of 1893 so excited Ferruccio Busoni that he drafted a letter to Verdi, in which he addressed him as [...] "Italy's leading composer" [...] and [...] "one of the noblest persons of our time", and in which he explained that [...] "Falstaff provoked in <b>me</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> revolution of spirit that I can... date [...] {{the beginning of a}} new epoch in my artistic life." [...] Antonio Scotti played the title role in Buenos Aires in July 1893; Gustav Mahler conducted the opera in Hamburg in January 1894; a Russian translation was presented in St Petersburg in the same month. Paris was regarded by many as the operatic capital of Europe, and for the production there in April 1894 Boito, who was fluent in French, made his own translation with the help of the Parisian poet Paul Solanges. This translation, approved by Verdi, is quite free in its rendering of Boito's original Italian text. Boito was content to delegate the English and German translations to William Beatty Kingston and Max Kalbeck respectively. The London premiere, sung in Italian, was at Covent Garden on 19 May 1894. The conductor was Mancinelli, and Zilli and Pini Corsi repeated their original roles. Falstaff was sung by Arturo Pessina; Maurel played the role at Covent Garden the following season. On 4 February 1895 the work was first presented at the Metropolitan Opera, New York; Mancinelli conducted and the cast included Maurel as Falstaff, Emma Eames as Alice, Zélie de Lussan as Nannetta and Sofia Scalchi as Mistress Quickly.|$|E

He also won the respect and loyalty of his troops: his motto was [...] "Feed your troops on victory". Monash was regarded with great respect by the British – a British captain on the staff of William Heneker's 8th Division described Monash as [...] "a great bullock of a man ... though his manners were pleasant and his behaviour far from rough, I have seen few men who gave <b>me</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> sensation of force ... a fit leader for the wild men he commanded". Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery later wrote: [...] "I would name Sir John Monash as the best general on the western front in Europe".|$|E
2500|$|Searching {{elsewhere}} for a bride, Charles looked to France instead. The English agent Kensington {{was sent to}} Paris in 1624 to examine the potential French match, and the marriage was finally negotiated in Paris by James Hay and Henry Rich. Henrietta Maria was aged just fifteen {{at the time of}} her marriage, but this was not unusually young for royal princesses of the period. Views on Henrietta Maria's appearance vary; her husband's niece, Sophia of Hanover commented that the... "beautiful portraits of Van Dyck had given <b>me</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> fine idea of all the ladies of England that I was surprised to see that the queen, who I had seen as so beautiful and lean, was a woman well past her prime.

2500|$|The {{major issue}} {{contemporary}} critics had with Leskov's prose {{was what they}} perceived to be an [...] "overabundance of colours"; the grotesque expressiveness of the language he used. This view was shared by some of his colleagues. Leo Tolstoy who rated Leskov very high still thought he was [...] "too over the top" [...] in his linguistic experiments. In a December 3, 1890, letter, writing {{of the short story}} [...] "The Hour of God's Will", he remarked: [...] "This fairytale is excellent, {{but it would have been}} much better if not for this overabundance of talent."
