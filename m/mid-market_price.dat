40|$|The Vector Generalised Linear Model (VGLM) {{framework}} extends Generalised Linear Models (GLMs) to a {{large number}} of univariate and multivariate statistical models. The object of this thesis is to study the estimation of the maximum elastic net penalised log-likelihood of VGLM models. As the elastic net penalty has a separable non-differentiable part, second-order proximal methods are considered. For VGLMs, depending on the model, it may be more convenient to use the Fisher information matrix instead of the Hessian. Hence, we propose a proximal Fisher scoring method. Two examples are then investigated. The first example is an application of an elastic net penalised ordinal probit model to the prediction of <b>mid-market</b> <b>price</b> changes for tick-by-tick Limit Order Book data. The second example is an application of an Expectation Maximisation (EM) proximal Newton/Fisher scoring algorithm to variable selection for a bivariate Poisson regression model applied to health care data...|$|E

The main aims of the project were twofold: (1) to identify for eleven benchmark years - occurring at five-year intervals starting with 1868 and ending in 1918 - Britain's 125 largest companies (as measured by the market capitalization of their ordinary shares); and (2) to construct a consistent dataset of the key financial characteristics of the identified companies. The project's aims were designed to serve two objectives: (1) to permit detailed measures of profitability for each identified company, embracing both security price appreciation (or depreciation, {{as the case may}} be) and payments of dividends and interest; and (2) the creation of a British stock exchange index compatible with the FT-SE 100 in use since 1984. The key financial characteristics of the companies examined by the project were: (1) the monthly closing price of each traded security for each identified company; (2) the number of each traded security outstanding {{at the end of each}} month. Multiplied together, characteristics (1) and (2) produce market capitalization by security for each month. Summing all securities issued by a company produces for each month its total market capitalization. The other key financial characteristics were: (3) the paid-up amount for each security, including premiums (if any); (4) the nominal value of each security; (5) the payments (if any) made in each month to holders of the securities. Characteristics (3) -(5) record the flows of funds to companies and the flows of funds from them, thereby permitting measures of financial profitability. The data relate to 'British' companies with London Stock Exchange quotes for their ordinary shares. To be included, companies had: to have their securities quoted in sterling (or at least a preponderance of them in sterling); to pay dividends and interest in sterling; to have a London office; and, to have a preponderance of British directors. Main Topics : This data collection is an interim deposit and further material will subsequently be added to complete it. This, first installment, is presented in two file sets. The first set consists of summary benchmark tables for four years: 1868, 1883, 1898, and 1913. In each of these tables, the largest 125 British companies are ranked according to the size of the market value of their ordinary shares on the last trading day in June of the relevant year. Column (2) shows, for each company, the market value of ordinary shares outstanding - the basis of the rankings. This value was arrived at in the following manner: the closing <b>mid-market</b> <b>price</b> (average of bid-ask) per share on the indicated day, multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. Column (3) reports analogous calculations for debentures (if any). Column (1) reports the sum of Columns (2) and (3), plus the market capitalization of any preference shares outstanding. All traded securities were allocated to one or another of the categories, so that Column (1) represents total market capitalization. The last column, headed dividend rate of return at market, is the total cash dividend paid on ordinary shares in the twelve months ending on the last trading day of June. The first file set also includes the scanned, edited data set from the Investor's Monthly Manual from which the benchmark rankings were taken. The second file set contains the data for individual companies. The data are set out in six columns. Column (1) is the date (by month). Column (2) is the last quoted price of the indicated security in the indicated month. Column (3) is the number of the indicated securities outstanding. Thus (Column 1) multiplied by (Column 2) equals the aggregate market value of the indicated security. Column (4) records the paid-up amount for each security. Column (5) records the nominal value of the security. Any difference between Columns (4) and (5) represents a liability incurred by the registered owner of the security. Column (6) records announced dividends (or interest, as the case may be) per share (or security) as a per cent of nominal value. Thus (Column 6) multiplied by (Column 4) equals the cash dividend (interest) paid on the share (security). Thus (Column 6) multiplied by (Column 4) multiplied by (Column 3) equals total cash dividend (or interest) paid by the company to holders of the indicated security. An integral part of the individual company data is the accompanying company notes, which provide detail on capital structure and dividends. This is especially important when bonus (or deeply discounted) shares are issued. Ignoring these notes may cause dividends in particular to be under-estimated. A Directory to the individual companies is also included. Please note: this study does not include information on named individuals and would therefore not be useful for personal family history research. <br...|$|E

40|$|In {{common with}} other retail sectors, {{the rise of}} the {{retailer}} ‘own-brand’ within the fashion market represents a shift in power from manufacturers to retailers and is indicative of market participants’ desire to gain competitive advantage over, and differentiation from, their competitors. Branding and the associated lifestyle affiliations are recognised as key components of success for participants within the fashion sector internationally; this is especially the case in the UK <b>mid-market</b> where historic <b>price</b> deflation, consumer interest in transient trends and poorly-observed copyright laws result in differentiation being difficult to sustain in tangible ways. Drawing on literature relevant to brand modeling in general and fashion branding in particular, this paper explores the dimensions of the mid-market fashion retailer own brand. The application of industry and consumer-focused primary research to this base allows the conceptualisation of the most significant dimensions – these are characterised according to their focus within the corporate and customer relationship. The expression of these brand dimensions at corporate and store levels as well as their intangible outcomes will be explored. Finally a model illustrating the chronological development of a fashion retailer’s own-brand will be proposed at the conference...|$|R
