40|$|The <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> premium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} but elusive parameters in finance. It is also called equity premium, <b>market</b> premium and <b>risk</b> premium. The term 'market risk premium' is difficult to understand because it is used to designate three different concepts: 1) Required <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> premium, which is the incremental return of a diversified portfolio (the market) over the risk-free rate (return of treasury bonds) required by an investor. It is needed for calculating the required return to equity (cost of equity). 2) Historical <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> premium, which is the historical differential return of the stock market over treasury bonds. 3) Expected <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> premium, which is the expected differential return of the stock market over treasury bonds. Many authors and finance practitioners assume that the expected <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> premium is equal to the historical <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> premium and to the required <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> premium. The CAPM assumes that the required <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> premium is equal to the expected <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> premium. However, the three concepts are different. The historical <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> premium is equal for all investors, but the required and the expected <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> premium are different for different investors. We also claim that there is no required <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> premium for the market as a whole: different investors use different required <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> premiums. required <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> premium; historical <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> premium; expected <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> premium; risk premium; equity premium; market premium;...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 19th century, both the direct {{administration}} of India by the British crown and the technological change ushered in by the industrial revolution, had the effect of closely intertwining the economies of India and Great Britain. In fact many of the major changes in transport and communications (that are typically associated with Crown Rule of India) had already begun before the Mutiny. [...] Since Dalhousie had embraced the technological change then rampant in Great Britain, India too saw rapid development of all those technologies. Railways, roads, canals, and bridges were rapidly built in India and telegraph links equally rapidly established in order that raw materials, such as cotton, from India's hinterland could be transported more efficiently to ports, such as Bombay, for subsequent export to England. Likewise, finished goods from England were transported back just as efficiently, for sale in the burgeoning Indian markets. However, unlike Britain itself, where the <b>market</b> <b>risks</b> for the infrastructure development were borne by private investors, in India, it was the taxpayers—primarily farmers and farm-labourers—who endured the risks, which, in the end, amounted to £50million. In spite of these costs, very little skilled employment was created for Indians. [...] By 1920, with a history of 60 years of its construction, only ten per cent of the [...] "superior posts" [...] in the railways were held by Indians.|$|E

Investors demand a risk premium for bearing the <b>market</b> volatility <b>risk</b> in addition to the <b>market</b> systematic <b>risk.</b> As a result, the <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> premium consists of two components, both related to the market volatility. After taking into account the volatility risk premium, we find strong evidence of a significantly positive relation between the <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> premium and the <b>market</b> systematic <b>risk.</b> We also find that the volatility risk premium is negative and significant, which distorts the positive <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> and return relation. <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> premium, <b>market</b> risk-return tradeoff, volatility risk premium, stochastic volatility, EMM,...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe price {{fluctuation}} risk of agricultural products {{has become one}} of the main risks faced by agricultural producers. The objective of implementing <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> management is to measure and assess accurately the sizes and degrees of risk involving agricultural products. In this paper, measurement and analysis of fruit <b>market</b> price <b>risk</b> were conducted on fruit species such as Fuji apple, orange, banana, pear, grape, watermelon and strawberry, using the VaR method. Empirical results show that normal distribution is not the optimal distribution model that can be applied in assessing fruit <b>market</b> <b>risk.</b> This is because different fruits have different degrees of <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> (i. e., strawberries and watermelons are fruits with high risk levels; apples, bananas and pears have relatively low risk levels; and grapes and oranges have middle risk levels). According to the results, fruits that belong to the same <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> level have similar features. It is thus necessary to conduct fruit <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> management with risk monitoring by classifying different types of produce as a single unit. This ensures efficiency and accuracy and reduces substantially the cost of <b>market</b> <b>risk</b> management...|$|R
