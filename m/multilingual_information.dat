To {{facilitate}} {{the ease of}} integrating WSD systems into other Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as Machine Translation and <b>multilingual</b> <b>Information</b> Retrieval, the cross-lingual WSD evaluation task was introduced a language-independent and knowledge-lean approach to WSD. The task is an unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation task for English nouns by means of parallel corpora. It follows the lexical-sample variant of the Classic WSD task, restricted to only 20 polysemous nouns.|$|E

40|$|<b>Multilingual</b> {{environmental}} <b>information</b> is communicated via different media. These {{media can}} be newspapers, TV, internet, WAP, SMS, etc. Each {{of the media}} has a presentation mode which fits best. Thus, {{it turned out that}} for newspapers, pictograms which indicate good, normal, and bad conditions, a map with pictograms and/or a very short text are to be preferred. In contrast, the information provided in the internet, can be very detailed and personalized and contain the latest data available at the moment the user requests the information. Furthermore, in the internet, the user can interactively select more details or change the presentation mode. For all media, the most challenging information mode is text. Since a template-based method where predefined sentences with empty slots filled at the time of generation cannot ensure coherent and cohesive text for all contextual settings, full-fledged generation techniques are needed. In this paper, we present the generation techniques as used for the production of <b>multilingual</b> air quality <b>information</b> in the framework of the MARQUIS-project. 1...|$|R
