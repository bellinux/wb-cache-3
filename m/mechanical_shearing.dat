25|$|Self-assembly of nanofibrous {{scaffolds}} is able {{to occur}} only when the fibers themselves are engineered for self-assembly. One common way to drive the self-assembly of scaffold fibers is to use amphiphilic peptides so that in water the hydrophobic moiety drives the self-assembly. Carefully calculated engineering of the amphiphilic peptides allows for precise control over the self-assembled matrix. Self-assembly {{is able to}} create both ordered and unordered topographies. Phillips et al. (2005) developed and tested in vitro and in vivo a self-aligned collagen-Schwann cell matrix, which allowed DRG neurite extension alignment in vitro. Collagen gels have been used extensively as substrates for three-dimensional tissue culture. Cells are able to form integrin-mediated attachments with collagen, which initiates cytoskeleton assembly and cell motility. As cells move along the collagen fibers they generate forces that contract the gel. When the collagen fibers are tethered at both ends, cell-generated forces create uniaxial strain, causing the cells and collagen fibers to align. The advantages of this matrix are its simplicity and speed of preparation. Soluble plasma fibronectin can also self-assemble into stable insoluble fibers when put under direct <b>mechanical</b> <b>shearing</b> within a viscous solution. Phillips et al. (2004) investigated a new method of shear aggregation that causes an improved aggregation. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>shearing</b> was created by dragging out a 0.2 ml bolus to 3cm with forceps; fibronectin aggregates into insoluble fibers at the rapidly moving interface in an ultrafiltration cell. The proposed mechanism for this fiber aggregation is protein extension and elongation under mechanical shear force, which leads to lateral packing and protein aggregation of fibers. Phillips et al. showed that mechanical shear produced by stretching a high viscosity fibronectin gel causes substantial changes in its structure and that when applied through uniaxial extension, a viscous fibronectin gel forms oriented fibrous fibronectin aggregates; additionally, the fibrous aggregates have a decreased solubility and can support the various cell types in vitro.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAlthough {{microorganism}} respiration inhibition by {{sodium azide}} (NaN 3) {{is used in}} some studies to identify activated sludge adsorption capacity, {{little is known about}} the effect of this compound on the suspension properties. In this study we have investigated the effect of NaN 3 addition on both volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient and rheology of activated sludge (AS) suspensions in a 1. 9 L bioreactor. The rheological properties (shear thinning one) of AS suspensions with and without NaN 3 addition are measured in situ (triphasic conditions). It appears that NaN 3 addition leads to a deflocculation of AS suspensions and thus a decrease in apparent viscosity. A small amount of suspended solids was added in order to obtain identical apparent viscosities (under 1. 2 or 46. 3 s− 1) for AS suspensions with and without NaN 3 addition. KLa values were then measured in both respiring and non-respiring suspensions for different air flow rates (2, 3 or 4 L/min) and under low or high <b>mechanical</b> <b>shear</b> rate (1. 2 or 46. 3 s− 1). Results show that under high <b>mechanical</b> <b>shear</b> rate, the respiration state for a given air flow rate does not impact the KLa values. On the contrary, under low <b>mechanical</b> <b>shear</b> rate, NaN 3 addition induces an increase of KLa values in comparison with those obtained with the respiring biomass. This effect, for a same apparent viscosity, is attributed to the deflocculation observed in the presence of NaN 3.
