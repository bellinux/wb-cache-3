2500|$|TUESDAY.—"Letter from {{solicitor}} informing me that I {{have come}} into £1,000,000 through the will of an Australian gold-digger named Tomkins. On referring to my diary I find that I saved his life two years ago by plunging into the Serpentine. This is very gratifying. Was late at the office as I had to look in at the Palace on the way, {{in order to get}} knighted, but managed to get a good deal of work done before I was interrupted by a madman with a razor, who demanded £100. Shot him after a desperate struggle. Tea at an ABC, where I met the Duke of —-. Fell into the Thames on <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>home,</b> but swam ashore without difficulty." ...|$|E
2500|$|Declarations {{of present}} state of mind: Much like a present-sense {{impression}} describes the outside world, declarant's statement {{to the effect of}} [...] "I am angry!" [...] or [...] "I am Napoleon!" [...] will be admissible to prove that the declarant was indeed angry, or did indeed believe himself to be Napoleon at that time. Used in cases where the declarant's mental state is at issue. Present-state-of-mind statements are also used as circumstantial evidence of subsequent acts committed by the declarant, like his saying, [...] "I'm gonna go buy some groceries and get the oil changed in my car on <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>home</b> from work." [...] Another exception is statements made in the course of medical treatment, i.e., statements made by a patient to a medical professional to help in diagnosis and treatment. Any statements contained therein that attribute fault or causation to an individual will generally not be admissible under this exception.|$|E

2500|$|Shore {{was born}} in Toronto, Canada, to Henry and Charlotte Shore. She was the {{youngest}} of seven children. She was drawn to both painting and nature at a young age, remarking [...] "I was on <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>home</b> from school and saw myself reflected in a puddle. It was the first time I had seen my image completely surrounded by nature, and I suddenly had an overwhelming sense of belonging to it—of actually being part of every tree and flower. I was filled with a desire to tell what I felt through painting." [...] Shore's mother supported Shore's artistic ambitions, but advised her to learn practical matters as well. After taking a domestic education class, at the age of 15, Shore began studying painting with the Canadian Impressionist Laura Muntz Lyall. Her works at this time are mostly genre scenes and thus conform to subject matter that would have been popular in Toronto's traditional art scene during the period.|$|E
2500|$|In France, Bunin found himself, for {{the first}} time, {{at the center of}} public attention. On 10 November 1933, the Paris {{newspapers}} came out with huge headlines: [...] "Bunin— the Nobel Prize laureate" [...] giving the whole of the Russian community in France cause for celebration. [...] "You see, up until then we, émigrés, felt like we were at the bottom there. Then all of a sudden our writer received an internationally acclaimed prize! And not for some political scribblings, but for real prose! After having been asked to write a first page column for the Paris Revival newspaper, I stepped {{out in the middle of}} the night onto the Place d'Italie and toured the local bistros on <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>home,</b> drinking in each and every one of them to the health of Ivan Bunin!" [...] fellow Russian writer Boris Zaitsev wrote. Back in the USSR the reaction was negative: Bunin's triumph was explained there as [...] "an imperialist intrigue." ...|$|E
