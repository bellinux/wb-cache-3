500|$|Keats {{was never}} a {{professional}} writer. Instead, he supported himself with a small income that he earned as a surgeon for Guy's Hospital. At the age of 23, Keats left the hospital, losing his source of income, in order to devote himself to writing poetry. He lived with Charles Brown, a friend who collected Keats's poetry while supporting him, during spring 1819 and composed poetry. The early products of this effort included La Belle Dame sans <b>Merci</b> and [...] "Ode to Psyche", {{the first of a}} series of odes that he would write that year. It is uncertain as to when the poem was actually completed, but Keats sent the poem to his brother on 3 May 1819 with an attached letter saying, [...] "The following poem, the last I have written, is the first and only one with which I have taken even moderate pains; I have, for the most part, dashed off my lines in a hurry; this one I have done leisurely; I think it reads the more richly for it, and it will I hope encourage me to write other things in even a more peaceable and healthy spirit." ...|$|E

2500|$|As knights and maidens gather, Hélène gives {{thanks to}} all (<b>Merci,</b> jeunes amies– [...] "Thank you, beloved friends"). [...] Henri arrives, exclaiming his joy (La brise souffle au loin– [...] "The breeze hovers about…"). [...] He leaves to find his father, but Procida arrives, announcing a plan to outwit his enemies with their {{massacre}} to {{take place at the}} foot of the altar after the vows have been said. She is torn, the more so following Henri's return, between her love and her duty (Sorte fatal! Oh, fier cimento!– [...] "Fatal destiny! Oh, fierce conflict!"). Finally, she can go no further and she tells Henri that they cannot be married. [...] Both men are furious with her for her seeming [...] betrayal. [...] Then Montfort arrives, takes the couple's hands, joins them together, and pronounces them married as the bells begin to ring. This is the signal for the Sicilians to rush in and hurl themselves upon Montfort and the French.|$|E
2500|$|Clues of Eminescu's {{views on}} love are contrasted by {{the element of}} {{physical}} desire, that {{of a young girl}} expecting her suitors—"the surge within a human being of a longing that she can only half-comprehend." [...] This [...] "puberal crisis" [...] and [...] "mysterious invasion of longing" [...] had also appeared in Heliade Rădulescu's piece. Such precedents suggest that Cătălina is a feeble, ingénue, victim of her instincts. According to Geo Vasile: [...] "she recognizes her own biological fate and accepts being courted by her mortal neighbor [...] The maiden who happened to catch Hyperion's affection stands for the narrow fold, the human, historical, ontological conspiracy, downright puny when confronted with the nocturnal body's destiny". Author Ilie Constantin notes that Cătălin was a natural suitor, who [...] "expunges Hyperion from Cătălina's attention, so that he and she may embark on their own union". In contrast to such readings, Vanhese sees the Princess as a playful destroyer, in the vein of La Belle Dame sans <b>Merci</b> and Salome.|$|E
2500|$|From [...] on 2 June, {{both sides}} {{exchanged}} artillery-fire but the French field guns were out-ranged by German medium artillery and the fort was bombed by German and Italian aircraft. Stukas raided Bir Hakeim {{more than twenty}} times but the French positions were so well built as to be almost invulnerable. The British were unable to reinforce the French, who repulsed the Ariete Division attack but on 2 June, the DAF had an easily observed bomb line around the fort and concentrated on the area with fighter patrols and fighter-bomber attacks. The sight of scores of burning vehicles helped to maintain {{the morale of the}} defenders, who harassed Axis communications around the fort, as did the 7th Motor Brigade and the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade in the vicinity. On 4 June, DAF fighters and fighter-bombers disrupted Stuka attacks and bombed Axis vehicles, setting off an ammunition wagon in view of the French but losing seven aircraft. Kœnig signalled Air Vice-Marshal Arthur Coningham: [...] "Bravo! <b>Merci</b> pour la R.A.F." [...] which brought the reply [...] "Merci pour le sport".|$|E

Hector was with Paolo taken to that place, and upon {{his refusal to}} continue his parole, was confined in a prison there, Paolo being allowed at his request to remain with him. He had had an interview with General <b>Merci,</b> who had treated him with much courtesy; for there were Scotch and Irish officers serving in the Imperial army {{as well as in}} that of France, and they were held in high esteem for their courage and daring.|$|E

60|$|As soon as {{spring set}} in, the Poitou {{regiment}} marched {{to join the}} marshal. The Bavarian army had been weakened by the withdrawal of four thousand men to aid the Imperialists, who had been defeated by the Swedes in Bohemia. Turenne, on hearing the news, at once prepared {{to take advantage of}} it, crossed the Rhine on a bridge of boats at Spires, and passed the Neckar, General <b>Merci</b> retiring before him. Stuttgart opened its gates, and Turenne established himself at Marienthal on the river Tauber. <b>Merci,</b> as he fell back, had caused a rumour to be spread that he was making for the Danube.|$|E

60|$|Turenne's {{force had}} been as hotly engaged. <b>Merci,</b> the best general in the Austrian army, had {{foreseen}} that an attempt might be made through the defile, and had posted strong bodies of infantry among the trees on either side.|$|E

60|$|Before long poetry absorbed Keats again; and {{the first}} few months of 1819 were the most {{fruitful}} of his life. Besides working at Hyperion, which he had begun during Tom's illness, he wrote The Eve of St. Agnes, The Eve of St. Mark, La Belle Dame Sans <b>Merci,</b> and nearly all his famous odes.|$|E
6000|$|Little (she writes) can {{you imagine}} the storm of indignation you [...] aroused in me by your remark that your {{feelings}} for me were those [...] suitable for a fourteen-year-old niece. <b>Merci.</b> Anything less like a [...] respectable uncle than yourself I cannot well imagine. The role would [...] never suit you, believe me, so do not try it.|$|E
6000|$|... "That will {{be before}} long, thank the saints! There is news {{that a great}} French army marched from Spires three days ago, and there {{is like to be}} a great fight before long; and if the French are beaten <b>Merci</b> will chase them back to the Rhine, {{recapture}} all the towns that they have taken, and perhaps enter Alsace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not bad! It {{will be a}} good {{field for}} me to work in, and the harder the task the better I shall like it. <b>Merci,</b> old friend. You put heart and courage into me when nothing else will. Come, the curtain is down, so I may be myself for a few hours, if actresses ever are themselves." ...|$|E
60|$|As soon as Turenne {{entered the}} defile he was {{encountered}} by a heavy fire from his unseen foes, who, falling {{back through the}} trees as he advanced, continued to gain strength. Turenne had to fight every foot of his way in order to dislodge the enemy, {{and it was not}} until Enghien had brought the battle to a conclusion on his side, that Turenne arrived and, forcing the intrenchments guarding the mouth of the defile, found himself in contact with <b>Merci,</b> who was now able to concentrate his whole force against him. The combat was a furious one. The troops were engaged at but forty paces apart, and sometimes had hand-to-hand encounters. <b>Merci</b> brought the whole of his cavalry into play, but Turenne was unable to use his, as they were behind his infantry and could not make their way out through the mouth of the defile.|$|E
60|$|He himself {{took the}} command here. Rosen {{commanded}} on the right. <b>Merci,</b> after {{passing through the}} wood, drew up his army in order of battle and opened fire on the French. The artillery, however, in no way shook their firmness, and seeing more troops in the distance advancing to reinforce them, <b>Merci</b> began the battle by {{an attack on a}} little wood on which the French right rested; {{while at the same time}} Turenne charged the Bavarian right wing with his cavalry, broke it up, and captured the cannon and twelve standards. But while on this side the victory was almost won, on the other side disaster had befallen the French. Their infantry, perceiving that the Bavarians, who were advancing to attack them, were much superior in force, were seized with a panic and scattered in all directions. The left wing of the Bavarians advanced rapidly, and, throwing themselves behind Turenne's wing, prepared to fall upon him in the rear.|$|E
60|$|They {{went forward}} with great speed and eagerness, {{for they were}} burning to {{retrieve}} their cowardly conduct at Marienthal. They carried the intrenchments <b>Merci</b> had thrown up {{at the mouth of}} the pass, and, heedless of the firing of the guns, rushed at the village. Here, however, they were received by so heavy a fire of musketry from the infantry posted there, who had loopholed all the walls and houses, that they came to a stop, and, being shot down in great numbers, turned and fled. The Count de Marsin was himself dangerously wounded. The Duc d'Enghien sent the Marquis de la Moussaie forward with a reinforcement of several regiments, but these, too, fell back before the Imperialists' fire. The Duc d'Enghien then rallied the infantry, added to them all those not yet engaged, and himself led them to the charge. <b>Merci</b> on his part brought forward his main body to the village.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Of course, we {{have heard}} all the {{particulars}} of the battle; and {{it was said that}} General <b>Merci</b> would have beaten Monsieur Turenne back {{had it not been for}} the Poitou regiment, commanded by a Scottish colonel, and said to be the finest under the command of the French generals. They say it stood for three hours against the attacks of the whole Bavarian army." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{quarter of}} an hour later she was in the saddle. But how {{different}} the mood from that of the former time. She had, indeed, given up her position as queen of the less to be vassal of the greater. Here was no showing off now; no scampering out of sight with Pansy, to perplex and tire her companion; no saucy remarks on LA BELLE DAME SANS <b>MERCI.</b> Elfride was burdened with the very intensity of her love.|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall {{open our}} {{trenches}} here tonight; {{the place is}} of some importance, {{as it is on}} the direct road to Nordlingen, and it is as well not to leave it behind us. This, however, we shall do, if news comes that <b>Merci</b> is marching to give us battle before that city, which we expect he will do. The Imperialists will like to fight there, for it was the scene of their great victory over the Duke of Weimar and the Swedes." ...|$|E
60|$|Enghien, {{anxious to}} attack, rode forward with Turenne, de Gramont, and Geis to reconnoitre the ground. It {{was found that}} between the armies {{there was a small}} river, with great pools and swamps on either side, and that the only {{approaches}} were by narrow and winding paths where two horsemen could scarcely ride abreast. Even Enghien felt that it would be madness to venture upon an attack. His artillery opened fire, that of the Bavarians replied, and the cannonade was continued till nightfall, inflicting a certain amount of loss on either side but in no way altering the position. Seeing that a battle could not be brought on here, Enghien marched two hours before daybreak for Nordlingen. At nine the army came down on to the great plain in front of that town, but he found that <b>Merci</b> had been beforehand with him, and had already taken up a strong position two leagues away, and between him and the city, and that his troops were already at work throwing up intrenchments. The prince ordered all the baggage to be left behind, and at once marched against the enemy. At four o'clock they were facing each other. <b>Merci</b> had, as usual, chosen his position with great judgment. In the middle of the plain rose two little hills about a thousand yards apart. On the hill on his left stood the castle of Allersheim, and here Merci's left wing, under General John de Werth, was posted; while at Weinberg his right, commanded by General Gleen, took up its station. The main body of the army, under <b>Merci</b> himself, lay behind a village a couple of hundred yards beyond the hills, and {{at the head of the}} passage between them. He had his cavalry on his two wings, his infantry in the centre, and had thrown forward some regiments to hold the village. On the two hills he had planted his cannon, sheltered by intrenchments, and in a position to sweep the entrance to the valley.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, monsieur, it {{was very}} sad (<b>merci,</b> monsieur, merci; thirty pipes, if you please), and I {{thought at the time}} that I should give up my voyageur life, and remain {{altogether}} in the settlement with my old woman. Mais, monsieur, that was not possible. When I spoke of it to my old woman, she called me an old woman; and you know, monsieur, that two old women never could live together in peace for twelve months under the same roof. So here I am, you see, ready again for the voyage." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{battle was}} now a desperate one. Enghien seemed to lead a charmed life. He was ever where the fight was hottest, {{encouraging}} the soldiers and setting them an example. His clothes were shot through in many places. Two horses were killed under him, and he received a contusion in the thigh. <b>Merci</b> on his part showed equal valour and intrepidity; but he was less fortunate, for {{he was struck by}} a musketball and killed. The news of his fall excited his soldiers to fury, and, hurling themselves on their assailants they cut the greater part of the infantry to pieces.|$|E
60|$|Je ne puis même pas m'exprimer en Anglais; comment voudriez vous que je le pourrais en Français? Plus heureux que vous, le Némésis {{des arts}} ne me visite pas sous le masque du désenchantement; elle me suce l'intelligence et me laisse bayer aux corneilles, sans capacité mais sans regret; sans espérance, c'est vrai, mais aussi, Dieu <b>merci,</b> sans désespoir. Un doux étonnement me tient; je ne m'habitue pas à me trouver si bûche, mais je m'y résigne; même si celà durait, ce ne serait pas désagréable--mais comme je mourrais certainement de faim, ce serait tout au moins regrettable pour moi et ma famille.|$|E
