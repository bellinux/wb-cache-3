5|$|During the Harrier's {{service the}} RAF {{positioned}} {{the bulk of}} the aircraft in West Germany to defend against a potential invasion of Western Europe by the Warsaw Pact forces; the unique abilities of the Harrier allowed the RAF to disperse their forces away from vulnerable airbases. The USMC used their Harriers primarily for close air support, operating from amphibious assault ships, and, if needed, forward operating bases. Harrier squadrons saw several deployments overseas. The Harrier's ability to operate with minimal ground facilities and very short runways allowed it to be used at locations unavailable to other fixed-wing aircraft. The Harrier received criticism for having a high accident rate and for a time-consuming <b>maintenance</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In the Gotthard Railway's {{early days}} {{ultrasound}} {{was not available}} to examine the tracks. Fractures within these were far more common than today, when special ultrasound equipped trains are employed in the <b>maintenance</b> <b>process.</b> The railway watchman was especially important in ensuring the Gotthard railway's safe operation. A railway watchman was assigned to a special segment of tracks which he had to inspect every day. Fractures, deformations and the tracks' general condition were to be reported to the track master. Tending to loose screws and cutting down shrubs were {{also part of the}} watchman's job description. Also putting out small shrub fires, caused by the heavily employed brakes of downhill running cargo trains, were part of his duty. The railway watchman was equipped with a red flag to be able to stop trains in an emergency. The Gotthard railway's [...] watchmen lived in specially provided [...] along the line. In Italian Language these watchman's houses are called Casello. Every day they had to inspect the tracks up to the next watchman's segment. The watchman houses were built along the entire Gotthard line with distances of up to 4 kilometres between them and were all numbered. From 1950 onward the track inspections didn't require as many inspections as before. Between Giubiasco and Rivera the railway watchamn then only had to perform such an inspection every other day. Their former watchman houses now remained unmanned and were subsequently used as holiday homes or private dwellings. From 1995 onward the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) turned to selling these watchman houses.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, two newly {{developed}} methods are combined for the optimization of <b>maintenance</b> <b>processes.</b> The first method {{is the development}} of a standard for the sequence of process steps in the implementation of various maintenance tasks.

With this logical design, key figures can be generated very simply. Areas of improvement are getting visible and the process standard is a good basis for new employees.

40|$|Although the {{prefrontal cortex}} (PFC) is {{consistently}} {{found to be}} associated with various working memory processes, the necessity of the PFC for such processes remains unclear. To elucidate PFC contributions to storage and rehearsal 0 <b>maintenance</b> <b>processes</b> engaged during verbal working memory function, we assessed behavior of patients with lesions to the left or right lateral PFC, and neural activity of healthy young subjects during fMRI scanning, during performance of working memory tasks. We found that PFC lesions did not affect storage processes—which is consistent with the notion that posterior cortical networks can support simple retention of information. We also found that PFC lesions did not affect rehearsal 0 <b>maintenance</b> <b>processes,</b> which was in contrast to our finding that healthy subjects performing a verbal delayed recognition task showed bilateral PFC activation. These combined imaging and behavioral data suggest that working memory rehearsal 0 <b>maintenance</b> <b>processes</b> may depend on both hemispheres, which may have implications for recovery of function and development of rehabilitation therapies after frontal injury.

40|$|Keywords: chicken, {{residual}} feed intake, resource allocation, immune response, Salmonella Enteritidis, energy partitioning. The continuous {{selection in}} farm animals for efficient production and high production levels {{may have led}} to animals that are "programmed" {{to put a lot of}} resources in production processes, at the expense of resources for <b>maintenance</b> <b>processes,</b> among which the immune system. When efficiently and non-efficiently producing animals in a population are discriminated, it is hypothesized that non-efficient animals are better able to reallocate resources from production <b>processes</b> to <b>maintenance</b> <b>processes</b> than efficient animals. Non-efficient animals may, thus, be better off than efficient animals when <b>maintenance</b> <b>processes</b> are under pressure. Residual feed intake is used as a trait to discriminate efficient and non-efficient animals. It is defined as the difference between observed feed intake and expected feed intake; in this thesis, expected feed intake is based on metabolic body weight and growth. Animals that eat more than expected have a high residual feed intake and are considered non-efficient, whereas animals that eat less than expected have a low residual feed intake and are considered efficient. The research described in this thesis was carried out with pullets. Pullets are young, growing female chickens that do not produce eggs yet. Pullets were rated from high to low residual feed intake as a phenotypic trait; animals with the highest and lowest values for residual feed intake were selected for further research. Immune responses to non-replicating antigens and to live Salmonella Enteritidis bacteria were investigated. The results showed that non-efficient pullets had a higher feed intake than efficient pullets, but body weight and growth were equal in efficient and non-efficient pullets. Energy partitioning trials showed that non-efficient pullets spent more energy on <b>maintenance</b> <b>processes</b> than efficient pullets. However, an infection with Salmonella Enteritidis did not lead to repartitioning of energy from production <b>processes</b> to <b>maintenance</b> <b>processes.</b> It was concluded that a Salmonella Enteritidis infection is not energetically costly. Efficient pullets had a lower immune status than non-efficient pullets in situations where the animals were not infected with Salmonella Enteritidis, whereas during a Salmonella Enteritidis infection the efficient pullets had higher immune responses than non-efficient pullets. It is suggested that efficient and non-efficient pullets, as measured by residual feed intake, may have different "immune coping styles"...|$|R
