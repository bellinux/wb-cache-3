2500|$|Glutamic acid was {{discovered}} and identified in 1866 by the German chemist Karl Heinrich Ritthausen, who treated wheat gluten (for {{which it was}} named) with sulfuric acid. Kikunae Ikeda of Tokyo Imperial University isolated glutamic acid as a taste substance in 1908 from the seaweed Laminaria japonica (kombu) by aqueous extraction and crystallization, calling its taste umami. Ikeda noticed that dashi, the Japanese broth of katsuobushi and kombu, had a unique taste not yet scientifically described (not sweet, salty, sour, or bitter). To verify that ionized glutamate was responsible for umami, he studied the taste properties of glutamate salts: calcium, potassium, ammonium, and <b>magnesium</b> <b>glutamate.</b> All these salts elicited umami and a metallic taste due to the other minerals. Of them, sodium glutamate was the most soluble, most palatable, and easiest to crystallize. Ikeda called his product [...] "monosodium glutamate", and submitted a patent to produce MSG; the Suzuki brothers began commercial production of MSG in 1909 as [...]|$|E

50|$|Another {{mechanism}} for input-specific long-term potentiation is temporal. NMDARs require both depolarization, {{to remove their}} <b>magnesium</b> block, and <b>glutamate</b> activation, to open their channels, to allow Ca2+ influx. LTP is thus localized at sites where NMDA channels are opened by active synaptic inputs that are releasing glutamate and causing depolarization of the postsynaptic cell, and will not affect nearby inactive synapses.|$|R
40|$|The {{sympathetic}} nerve cell line PC- 12 is killed by glutamate in a concentration-dependent manner. Although glycine and the deletion of <b>magnesium</b> weakly potentiate <b>glutamate</b> toxicity and PC- 12 cells express N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor mRNA, most toxicity is mediated {{by means of}} a mechanism independent of typical N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Glutamate toxicity is, however, greatly enhanced by prior exposure to nerve growth factor or basic fibroblast growth factor. Glutamate killing is blocked by epidermal growth factor and, to a lesser extent, by vitamin E. These observations show that synergistic interactions between growth factors and excitotoxic amino acids may play critical roles in the developing nervous system and that antioxidants attenuate this toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Lactobacillus bulgaricus is the {{bacteria}} {{commonly used in}} probiotic dairy product, including yogurt and cheese. The bacteria may be stored {{for long periods of}} time if it is freeze-dried. The cryoprotectant mixture for L. bulgaricus was optimized during the process of freeze-drying using a Plackett-Burman design and the steepest ascent test. In our initial tests, the cell survival rate and the number of viable cells were associated with the type of cyroprotectant used. Therefore, our optimization protocol focused on increasing survival rate. Substances that previously had a protective effect during freeze-drying were investigated, for example: sucrose, lactose, skim milk powder, sodium bicarbonate, sodium <b>glutamate,</b> <b>magnesium</b> sulfate, sodium ascorbate, yeast extract, vitamin B 2, and phosphate buffer. We determined that the optimum cryoprotectant composition for L. bulgaricus consists of 28. 0 g/ 100 mL skim milk powder, 24. 0 g/ 100 mL lactose and 4. 8 g/ 100 mL sodium ascorbate. The optimized cryoprotectant provides a 63. 25...|$|R
