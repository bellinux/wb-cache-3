500|$|Both the King and Queen were fond {{of their}} niece, Princess Victoria of Kent. Their {{attempts}} {{to forge a}} close relationship with the girl were frustrated by the conflict between the King and the Duchess of Kent, the young princess' widowed mother. The King, angered at what he took to be disrespect from the Duchess to his wife, took the opportunity at what proved to be his final birthday banquet in August 1836 to settle the score. Speaking to those assembled at the banquet, who included the Duchess and Princess Victoria, William expressed his hope that he would survive until Princess Victoria was 18 so that the Duchess of Kent would never be regent. He said, [...] "I trust to God that my life may be spared for nine months longer... I should then have the satisfaction of leaving the exercise of the Royal authority to the personal authority of that young lady, heiress presumptive to the Crown, and not {{in the hands of a}} person now near me, who is surrounded by evil advisers and is herself incompetent to act with propriety in the situation in which she would be placed." [...] The speech was so shocking that Victoria burst into tears, while her <b>mother</b> <b>sat</b> in silence and was only with difficulty persuaded not to leave immediately after dinner (the two left the next day). William's outburst undoubtedly contributed to Victoria's tempered view of him as [...] "a good old man, though eccentric and singular". William survived, though mortally ill, to the month after Victoria's coming of age. [...] "Poor old man!", Victoria wrote as he was dying, [...] "I feel sorry for him; he was always personally kind to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vladimir's {{theatrical}} inclinations {{became obvious}} {{at an early}} age, and were supported by his paternal grandmother Dora Bronshteyn, a theater fan. The boy used to recite poems, standing on a chair and [...] "flinging hair backwards, like a real poet," [...] often using in his public speeches expressions he could hardly have heard at home. Once, {{at the age of}} two, when he had tired of the family's guests' poetry requests, he, according to his <b>mother,</b> <b>sat</b> himself under the New-year tree with a frustrated air about him and sighed: [...] "You silly tossers! Give a child some respite!" [...] His sense of humor was extraordinary, but often baffling for people around him. A three-year-old could jeer his father in a bathroom with unexpected poetic improvisation ("Now look what's here before us / Our goat's to shave himself!") or appall unwanted guests with some street folk song, promptly steering them away. Vysotsky remembered those first three years of his life in the autobiographical Ballad of Childhood (Баллада о детстве, 1975), one of his best-known songs.|$|E
60|$|Thus adjured {{the sisters}} ran {{laughing}} to the window, but the stately <b>mother</b> <b>sat</b> still.|$|E

6000|$|... "Emily—and George—are in {{the front}} room," [...] said the mother quietly, for it was Sunday afternoon. I {{satisfied}} the little ones; I said {{a few words to}} the <b>mother,</b> and <b>sat</b> down to take off my clogs.|$|R
60|$|My <b>mother,</b> who <b>sat</b> {{with her}} back to the window, would always {{consider}} it due to Mrs. Booch to turn about and regard the evening in the act of elongation or contraction, whichever phase it might be.|$|R
60|$|There was silence. The <b>mother</b> <b>sat</b> {{with her}} hands folded in her apron, her face set, thinking.|$|E
60|$|<b>Mother</b> <b>sat</b> {{across the}} kitchen table from him, pretending to read the Grimsby Recorder, but really {{watching}} him.|$|E
60|$|Randal jumped {{downstairs to}} the great hall, where his <b>mother</b> <b>sat.</b> Simon Grieve was telling her all about it.|$|E
50|$|Depending {{upon the}} season, {{one of the}} two is active and the other is inactive. When Harry arrived, at the last day of Summer's power, <b>Mother</b> Winter <b>sat</b> in a rocking chair, knitting, and Mother Summer was up, bustling about.|$|R
50|$|The {{women did}} as commanded, except his <b>mother.</b> She <b>sat</b> beside {{him until he}} took his last breath then she burnt all his treasures, killed the horses and {{returning}} to her son's feet, she pierced her body with a sword.|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile the <b>mother</b> dove <b>sat</b> on {{the edge}} of her nest, crying bitterly, when a heron, who was flying slowly past the rock, was filled with pity for her, and stopped to ask, 'What is the matter, you poor dove?' ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was utterly}} humiliated. The <b>mother</b> <b>sat</b> in silence, suffering, like some saint {{out of place}} at the brutal board.|$|E
60|$|Captain Barclay {{listened in}} silence, {{with a very}} grave face. Their <b>mother</b> <b>sat</b> down in a chair, with a white face.|$|E
6000|$|Imogen was patting his shoulder, {{his uncle}} {{looking at him}} sidelong; only his <b>mother</b> <b>sat</b> unmoving, till, {{affected}} by her stillness, Val said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; [...] "Southampton, {{the twelfth}} of August, dear father,"' said Loveday; {{and they were}} as silent as {{relations}} at the reading of a will. Anne, for whom the letter had a singular fascination, came in with her <b>mother</b> and <b>sat</b> down.|$|R
60|$|And {{with that}} he motioned me to precede him. Silently I pressed Fra Gervasio's hand, and on that {{departed}} {{without so much as}} another look at my <b>mother,</b> who <b>sat</b> there a silent witness of a scene which she approved.|$|R
50|$|Jonathan {{thinks about}} the {{conversation}} before, and thinks that ben Ezra must hate him for making Susannah not leave. That night, he dreams that his <b>mother</b> is <b>sat</b> at her loom in the Cyclops cave and tells him that she is still alive.|$|R

6000|$|They went {{straight}} back to Keokuk. My <b>mother</b> <b>sat</b> silent and thinking for many days--a thing {{which had never}} happened before. Then one day she said: ...|$|E
60|$|On a dim gray morning, <b>mother</b> and {{daughter}} <b>sat</b> by the fireside, with another long day before them.|$|R

60|$|All {{the good}} people who were {{gathered}} around the table of the Sign of <b>Mother</b> Goose <b>sat</b> thinking for a while over the story. As for Boots, he {{buried his face in}} the quart pot and took a long, long pull at the ale.|$|R
60|$|Her father incessantly lashed her, On {{water and}} bread She was grudgingly fed; Whenever her father he thrashed her Her <b>mother</b> <b>sat</b> {{down on her}} head.|$|E
60|$|Her <b>mother</b> <b>sat</b> mowing, and mumbling, {{and shaking}} her head, but whether angrily or remorsefully, or in denial, or only in her {{physical}} infirmity, did not appear.|$|E
60|$|They {{tried to}} be calm, poor things, as their <b>mother</b> <b>sat</b> up, looking pale but steady, and put away her grief to think and plan for them.|$|E
60|$|Two {{letters of}} the nine had been for Mary. After reading them, she had passed them to her <b>mother,</b> and <b>sat</b> playing with her tea-spoon absently, till with a sudden {{recollection}} {{she returned to her}} sewing, which she had kept on her lap during breakfast.|$|R
60|$|He {{hated the}} little man, who {{made such a}} clod of him. Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the <b>mother,</b> who <b>sat</b> quiet and with that {{peculiar}} shut-off look of the poor who {{have to depend on}} the favour of others.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Terence has promust, mother,' sez she, an' the could sweat bruk out {{all over}} me. Ould <b>Mother</b> Sheehy <b>sat</b> down of a heap an' began playin' wid the cups.

60|$|The {{father and}} <b>mother</b> <b>sat</b> by the {{fireplace}} that was spanned by the four- centred arch bearing the family shields on its haunches, and groaned aloud--the lady more than Sir John.|$|E
60|$|Tom Brangwen gave a sharp little laugh. The <b>mother</b> {{and father}} <b>sat</b> silent, with {{listening}} faces. Skrebensky waited. She was speaking for him.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Terence has promust, mother," [...] sez she, an' the could sweat bruk out {{all over}} me. Ould <b>Mother</b> Sheehy <b>sat</b> down of a heap an' began playin' wid the cups.
