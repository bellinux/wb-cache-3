They ran until 1949, when two engines from the north engine house were replaced by electric pumps. In 1950 automatic shutdown equipment was installed to prevent damage {{in the event of a}} burst main or overloading of the new electric pumps. This meant that it was no longer essential to have staff on site 24 hours a day. The decorative chimney was shortened in the 1960s.

40|$|This is an {{empirical}} {{study on the}} effect of house price on stock-market participation and its depths based on unique China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data in 2011 and 2013 including 36213 sample households. We mainly found that, with an increase of one thousand RMB per square meter in macro house price, the probability to participate in the stock market will increase by 5. 4 % before controlling for wealth effect and 2. 84 % afterwards, indicating the existence of wealth effect. The participation depths of the stock-total asset ratio is expected to decrease by 0. 23 % and absolute stock asset is observed to decrease by 5. 8 thousand RMB in response to one thousand RMB increase of per square <b>meter</b> <b>house</b> price. The effect of house price on participation decision is also related to housing area, and the negative effect of house price on stock market participation depths gets more intense with the increase of the stock-total asset ratio...|$|E
40|$|In Norway, {{the average}} house size has {{increased}} with 8. 4 m 2 between 2001 and 2013. During the same time, households {{have experienced a}} huge increase in disposable income, house prices have reach unprecedentedly high levels {{and the size of}} households have been reduced. This paper examines which forces determine the owner-occupiers’ demand for house size in Norway and why the average house size has increased between 2001 and 2013. Using household level data from Statistics Norway’s Survey of Living Conditions, I estimate an identical cross-sectional regression for each of the five survey years, regressing the number of square <b>meter</b> <b>house</b> size on income, price, household characteristics, geographical and structure related variables. Inserting average values for all explanatory variables, I find given the explanatory variables, higher predicted house size each survey year. The increase in predicted house size exceeds the increase in the average square meters indicating changes inherent in my explanatory variables combined reduce demand for house size. Specifically, a trend towards smaller households drives down the size of dwellings, all else equal. Instead, macroeconomic variables including the interest rate, credit availability and price expectations can help explain why we live bigger...|$|E
