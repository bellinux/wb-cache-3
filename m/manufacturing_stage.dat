2500|$|An oral {{polio vaccine}} {{turned out to be}} {{effective}} when vaccinations were administered by volunteer staff without formal training; the results also demonstrated increased ease and efficiency of administering the vaccines. Effective oral vaccines have many advantages; for example, there is no risk of blood contamination. Vaccines intended for oral administration need not be liquid, and as solids, they commonly are more stable and less prone to damage or to spoilage by freezing in transport and storage. Such stability reduces the need for a [...] "cold chain": the resources required to keep vaccines within a restricted temperature range from the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>stage</b> to the point of administration, which, in turn, may decrease costs of vaccines.|$|E

40|$|In the Mediterranean area, salted {{and dried}} roe from the gray Mugil cephalus “bottarga” {{represent}} a speciality food with great commercial value. Bottarga is currently produced by a traditional handmade process and, the risk of human bacterial contamination during its manufacturing is still unknown; in this perspective the foodborne pathogen Staphylococcus aureus could potentially contaminate this product due to poor sanitation or bad handling during processing. The aim of this work is: to evaluate the contamination level of foodborne pathogens at different product <b>manufacturing</b> <b>stages</b> and, in addition, to describe a fast and realizable method for the rapid detection of S. aureus in bottarga samples in the field.
