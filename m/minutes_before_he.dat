5|$|A {{few minutes}} later {{he was at the}} {{northern}} end of a pedestrian precinct, Royal Exchange Passage (formally called Royal Exchange Buildings), near the junction with Threadneedle Street, where a further police cordon stopped him from proceeding. He turned to walk south along Royal Exchange Passage instead, where, <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> arrived, officers had clashed with up to 25 protesters. Riot police from the Met's TSG, accompanied by City of London police dog handlers, had arrived there from the cordon in Threadneedle Street to help their colleagues.|$|E
5|$|Dunfermline Athletic {{entered the}} second round after {{receiving}} a bye {{in the first round}} draw and faced the First Division club and previous season's runners-up, Clyde, at Broadwood Stadium. Mark Burchill scored first for Dunfermline in the 26th minute with Ruari MacLennan equalising for Clyde one minute into the second half. Owen Morrison scored Dunfermline's second goal after 57 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> and Burchill both scored again to make it 4–1 and win the match.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from his {{director and the}} exhibit's drug manufacturer sponsor, Burton steals Zero's medical records in hopes of discovering new information. Zero and Burton examine an old blood sample of Zero's under a microscope and discover Miss HIV (Michael Callen), who {{points out that the}} original study that was used to label Patient Zero as the first person to bring HIV to North America did not prove any such thing, but instead helped prove that HIV was sexually transmitted, leading to the development of safer sex practices. Under this interpretation, Zero could be lauded as a hero for his candor in participating in that original study. As Burton ponders this, an unknown fluid squirts from the eye pieces of the microscope, drenching Zero and making him appear on video. He joyously declares his innocence on tape but the effect only lasts five <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> fades away again. Zero angrily accuses Burton of not caring for him at all and only wanting to use him for the exhibit, then storms out.|$|E
60|$|I obeyed him, {{and waited}} for nearly a <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> had given his {{directions}} and joined me. Then he took his seat by my side and we drove quickly off.|$|R
6000|$|Crosbie {{remained}} {{silent for a}} <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> answered, and then {{he spoke in a}} serious voice. [...] "Lady Alexandrina," [...] said he, [...] "I would beg from you a great favour." ...|$|R
60|$|Pleased by the compliment, yet {{a little}} conscience-stricken {{at the small}} share he {{deserved}} of it, Uncle Enos sat rubbing up his glasses a <b>minute,</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> led to the subject {{he had in his}} mind.|$|R
25|$|An 18-year-old partygoer who {{was arrested}} at the {{incident}} was booked into Collin County Jail on charges of misdemeanor, evading arrest and interfering with police. The charges against him were later dropped. According to a police report, he ran from police {{for two to three}} <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was caught. The girl who was restrained by Casebolt on video was not charged.|$|E
25|$|England's last {{recognised}} batting pairing, between Flintoff and wicket-keeper Geraint Jones, saw England to lunch, but Flintoff {{had suffered}} {{an injury to}} his left shoulder and looked in obvious pain, and Jones departed shortly after lunch. Giles lasted longer, batting through 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was caught by Hayden, and Harmison faced one delivery to leave England at 131 for 9.|$|E
25|$|Blackpool {{travelled}} to Scunthorpe United on 15 December, {{and recorded}} their second victory in three games. Andy Morrell put Blackpool {{in the lead}} just before the half-hour mark; Wes Hoolahan doubled the scoreline from the penalty spot on 58 minutes (fifteen <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was sent off); and Keigan Parker made it three on 88 minutes. Ian Baraclough pulled one back for the Iron in injury time.|$|E

6000|$|The old man {{rubbed his}} bristling jaw, that seemed even lanker than when Bartley saw it last. He waited almost a <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> replied, [...] "I don't know as I've got any call to tell you." ...|$|R

25|$|During the First World War, many {{volunteers from}} the Defence Force {{travelled}} to Great Britain and joined the British Army, {{and many of them}} were killed in action. One of them mentioned by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was Private Jacotine of the CLI, who was the last man left alive in his unit at the Battle of Lys, and who continued to fight for 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was killed.|$|E
25|$|The German police {{concluded}} that Duggan {{had committed suicide}} after running several kilometres from the apartment {{in which he had}} been staying, then jumping in front of early-morning traffic. A British coroner rejected a suicide verdict in 2003 after hearing the London Metropolitan Police describe the LaRouche movement as a political cult. Duggan telephoned his mother, Erica Duggan, 50 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died, apparently distressed about his involvement in it.|$|E
25|$|Patterson {{knocked out}} Johansson {{in the fifth}} round of their rematch on June 20, 1960, {{to become the first}} man in history to regain the Undisputed World Heavyweight Championship. Johansson hit the canvas hard, {{seemingly}} out before he landed flat on his back. With glazed eyes, blood trickling from his mouth and his left foot quivering, he was counted out. Johansson lay unconscious for five <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was helped onto a stool.|$|E
6000|$|It was, therefore, with an alacrity which, the <b>minute</b> <b>before,</b> <b>he</b> could scarce have commanded, {{and which}} seemed to express a stern pleasure, that, having pressed his lips to the cold brow of the unhappy Magdalen, the armourer replied: ...|$|R

60|$|The {{proposition}} to {{take the}} child from him had come to Silas quite unexpectedly, and his speech, uttered under a strong sudden impulse, {{was almost like a}} revelation to himself: a <b>minute</b> <b>before,</b> <b>he</b> had no distinct intention about the child.|$|R
25|$|McIlroy {{topped the}} {{qualification}} standings for the 2012 Ryder Cup. He picked up three {{points for the}} European team, partnering with Graeme McDowell in two foursomes and one fourballs match, and with Ian Poulter in the second day fourballs. On the final day, a mix up with his tee time meant that he arrived only 12 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was due to tee off, after being escorted in by a police officer. He defeated Keegan Bradley 2&1 to help Europe win 13½-14½.|$|E
25|$|At 13.59 in {{an attempt}} to {{distract}} the anti-aircraft gunners, Sergente Maggiore Luigi Valotti, flying a Fiat CR.42 of 354 Squadriglia, started performing aerobatics {{over the heads of the}} astounded ships gunners, who after a while started to shoot at him. He lasted six <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was shot down and killed. Further attacks were unable to get through the anti-aircraft barrage and the Italian aircraft flew back to base, landing at 15.50 pursued by the Ark Royals Fulmars, which strafed the airfield at Cagliari (Sardinia), damaging ten seaplanes and causing three casualties.|$|E
25|$|Linklater {{assembled}} the cast {{for two weeks}} of rehearsals in Austin, Texas before principal photography began in order to fine-tune the script. The result was a fusion of Linklater's writing, the novel and the actors' input. To prepare for their respective roles, Cochrane came up with his character five <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> got on the elevator to work; Downey Jr. memorized his dialogue by writing it all out in run-on sentences, studying them and then converting them to acronyms; and Reeves relied on the book, marking down each scene in the screenplay to the corresponding page.|$|E

25|$|The {{party had}} its origins as a Facebook group {{which has the}} same name as the party. The issue of {{starting}} a party had been discussed at several meetings {{in relation to the}} group, although a majority had been opposed to starting a party. On 18 January 2013 the page's main administrator, Raymond Londal, asked for 500 people to like they post if they wanted him to start the preparation for a party, including collecting the necessary 500 signatures needed to register a party. Londal had initially given a deadline to 1 March, but it took only 75 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> had sufficient likes to proceed.|$|E
25|$|His {{unbroken}} {{partnership of}} 85 with Compton at Adelaide revealed admirable fighting qualities, and cricket intelligence. He made only five scoring shots, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, in his stay of 133 minutes, {{and he was}} at the wickets 95 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> opened his account. Mainly he was watching his partner take charge of the game, but of the 276 balls sent down during their time together Evans took 97 of them, and not only helped to save the team from certain defeat, but also enabled Compton to join the select band who have compiled a century in each innings of a Test.|$|E

Billy's next stop is Wembley Stadium and again he discovers the torchbearers have already left. Billy then goes to West Ham United F.C. and catches up with the other torchbearers but unfortunately Billy has lost his pass and is not allowed in. His taxi driver, Hercules, appears with Billy's pass and he takes part in the celebrations. Billy then wakes up in the hair and beauty salon in Walford {{and it turns out}} he was dreaming.|$|E
60|$|Merril {{unfolded}} the document, and Jimmy {{noticed that}} the half-contemptuous toleration died out of {{his face as he}} read it. Then he quietly handed it back, and sat very still for at least a <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> turned to his companion again.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she turned}} and left him with the pony, staring vaguely after her, flushed in face, with {{a big piece of}} minted silver in his hand. It was at least a <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> slipped it into his pocket with a curious little laugh.|$|R

25|$|In April, Bengaluru {{played the}} home game against Royal Wahingdoh. The game saw flurry of goals with Robin Singh, Shankar Sampingiraj, Josh Walker {{countering}} three goals by the visiting {{team and the}} game ended at 3–3. Before the next game against Mumbai, Bengaluru were trailing by 3 points to the table topper Mohun Bagan, in spite of having played 2 more games, {{so it was a}} crucial match for Bengaluru to stay in the title hunt, but the game turned out to be 4th consecutive draw between the two sides. In spite of continuous attack by Bengaluru, the first half remained goalless. In the second half, against the run of the play, Rahul Bheke scored the goal for visitors {{to take the lead in}} 67th minute. Bengaluru intensified the attack and Robin Singh equalized in the closing <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was sent-off. The next game for Bengaluru was another top of the table clash with Pune F.C.. Bengaluru quickly got ahead when Shankar Sampingiraj scored the fastest goal of the season and the second fastest I-League goal of all time, in 15 seconds. Bengaluru doubled the lead just before half-time when C.K. Vineeth scored a goal from Beikhokhei Beingaichho's pass and Bengaluru scored their first ever win against Pune team. In three days, Bengaluru faced another Pune based team Bharat FC. Facing the depleted time, Bengaluru easily won the game 2–0 with goals from Eugeneson Lyngdoh and C.K. Vineeth in each half respectively, with both the assists coming from Sean Rooney.|$|E
500|$|Cobain has said, [...] "The entire song {{is made up}} of {{contradictory}} ideas [...] It's {{just making}} fun of the thought of having a revolution. But it's a nice thought."

You need syllables to fill up this space or you need something that rhymes." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison gifted Dylan his vintage Gibson J-200 {{acoustic}} guitar {{before the show}} and was then taken aback that Dylan arranged for [...] "Hare Krishna Mantra" [...] to be played over the PA <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> and the Band went on stage. Mukunda Goswami, {{one of the six}} pioneer devotees who founded the Hare Krishna movement's London temple and played on the recording, has identified this exposure as reflective of how the ancient Maha Mantra [...] "penetrated British society" [...] {{as a result of the}} Harrison-produced single. Harrison watched Dylan's performance from the VIP enclosure, an experience that informed the lyrics to a new composition, [...] "Behind That Locked Door".|$|E
60|$|He caught {{our hero}} {{by the arm}} and hurried him over the way and into the crowd.
