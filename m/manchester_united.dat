5|$|Although Newcastle had {{two games}} in hand over <b>Manchester</b> <b>United</b> going into April, their {{advantage}} was slim in comparison {{that at the end}} of January when Newcastle had a 12-point lead over <b>Manchester</b> <b>United.</b> When both teams met in March at St James' Park, Cantona scored the winning goal for <b>Manchester</b> <b>United</b> and goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel produced a number of outstanding saves which prevented midfielder Peter Beardsley and striker Les Ferdinand from scoring.

5|$|Both sides had a {{connection}} to the early history of European football; Chelsea were invited {{to take part in the}} inaugural European Cup in 1955â€“56 as champions of England, only to be denied entry by The Football League, allowing <b>Manchester</b> <b>United</b> to become the first English entrants in the competition the following season. In February 1958, eight <b>Manchester</b> <b>United</b> players were killed in the Munich air disaster, when the aeroplane carrying their team back from a match in Belgrade crashed while attempting to take off from a refuelling stop in Munich. Manager Matt Busby was seriously injured in the crash and almost died as a result, but he rebuilt the team, and in May 1968, <b>Manchester</b> <b>United</b> became the first English winners of the European Cup, beating Benfica 4â€“1 in the 1968 European Cup Final. Chelsea won their first European trophy three years later, when they beat Real Madrid 2â€“1 in the 1971 European Cup Winners' Cup Final replay after a 1â€“1 draw in the first match. Both Chelsea and <b>Manchester</b> <b>United</b> won that same competition during the 1990s â€“ first <b>Manchester</b> <b>United</b> beat Barcelona 2â€“1 in the 1991 final (followed by victory over Red Star Belgrade in the 1991 Super Cup), and then Chelsea beat VfB Stuttgart in the 1998 final (followed by victory over Real Madrid in the 1998 Super Cup, their most recent European success). <b>Manchester</b> <b>United</b> then won their second European Cup the following year, beating Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final.|$|E
