5|$|The {{club was}} founded in 2005 by disaffected {{supporters}} of <b>Manchester</b> <b>United.</b> Although fans had various reasons for dissatisfaction, the catalyst for F.C.

Supporters first considered forming a breakaway club in 1998 during an attempted takeover of <b>Manchester</b> <b>United</b> by BSkyB. The creation of F.C.

5|$|After Euro 96, <b>Manchester</b> <b>United</b> again {{sought to}} sign Shearer, and {{attempted}} to enter the battle for his signature.

Ultimately Shearer joined his boyhood club and Manchester United's title rivals Newcastle United.|$|E
5|$|Although Newcastle had {{two games}} in hand over <b>Manchester</b> <b>United</b> going into April, their {{advantage}} was slim in comparison {{that at the end}} of January when Newcastle had a 12-point lead over <b>Manchester</b> <b>United.</b> When both teams met in March at St James' Park, Cantona scored the winning goal for <b>Manchester</b> <b>United</b> and goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel produced a number of outstanding saves which prevented midfielder Peter Beardsley and striker Les Ferdinand from scoring. The win was Manchester United's ninth successive victory in the league, who also beat Newcastle 2–0 in the corresponding fixture at Old Trafford in December 1995.|$|E

5|$|Both sides had a {{connection}} to the early history of European football; Chelsea were invited {{to take part in the}} inaugural European Cup in 1955–56 as champions of England, only to be denied entry by The Football League, allowing <b>Manchester</b> <b>United</b> to become the first English entrants in the competition the following season. In February 1958, eight <b>Manchester</b> <b>United</b> players were killed in the Munich air disaster, when the aeroplane carrying their team back from a match in Belgrade crashed while attempting to take off from a refuelling stop in Munich. Manager Matt Busby was seriously injured in the crash and almost died as a result, but he rebuilt the team, and in May 1968, <b>Manchester</b> <b>United</b> became the first English winners of the European Cup, beating Benfica 4–1 in the 1968 European Cup Final. Chelsea won their first European trophy three years later, when they beat Real Madrid 2–1 in the 1971 European Cup Winners' Cup Final replay after a 1–1 draw in the first match. Both Chelsea and <b>Manchester</b> <b>United</b> won that same competition during the 1990s – first <b>Manchester</b> <b>United</b> beat Barcelona 2–1 in the 1991 final (followed by victory over Red Star Belgrade in the 1991 Super Cup), and then Chelsea beat VfB Stuttgart in the 1998 final (followed by victory over Real Madrid in the 1998 Super Cup, their most recent European success). <b>Manchester</b> <b>United</b> then won their second European Cup the following year, beating Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final.|$|E

5|$|Despite United's early pressure, it was Barcelona {{who scored}} the first {{goal of the}} match.
