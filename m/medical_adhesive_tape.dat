50|$|Johnson became vice {{president}} at J&J in 1918. Johnson also had an abiding interest in politics, and served a term as the Mayor of Highland Park, New Jersey. He {{was elected president of}} Johnson & Johnson from 1932-1938, and became {{chairman of the board of}} J&J in 1938. Johnson also held a reserve commission in the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps during the 1930s. At the outbreak of World War II, Johnson's work in identifying products needed by the war effort resulted in the Permacell division of J&J inventing duct tape for sealing ammunition boxes. J&J plant managers simply took their existing cloth <b>medical</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape,</b> added a waterproof plastic layer with a more aggressive adhesive, and produced it in olive drab (OD) green to match the ammunition cans. During the war, J&J would become a major supplier for combat first aid kits and other military supplies. In 1941, Johnson started the Ethicon subsidiary.|$|E

50|$|The {{idea for}} what became duct tape came from Vesta Stoudt, an ordnance-factory worker {{and mother of}} two Navy sailors, who worried that {{problems}} with ammunition box seals would cost soldiers precious time in battle. She wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1943 with the idea to seal the boxes with a fabric tape, which she had tested at her factory. The letter was forwarded to the War Production Board, who put Johnson & Johnson on the job. The Revolite division of Johnson & Johnson had made <b>medical</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>tapes</b> from duck cloth from 1927 and a team headed by Revolite's Johnny Denoye and Johnson & Johnson's Bill Gross developed the new <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape,</b> designed to be ripped by hand, not cut with scissors.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the relationship between the peel force required to remove the <b>medical</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>tapes</b> and the angle of peel. Method : Three kinds of <b>adhesive</b> <b>tapes</b> to fix gauze, 25 mm in width and 125 mm in length (Tape A, B and C) were stuck on a bakelite board for 30 minutes, and then removed while the peel forces were recorded. Peel force measurements were obtained at 30 °, 60 °, 90 °, 120 °, 150 °, and 170 °. Tape A was rayon non-woven fabric coated with an acrylic <b>adhesive.</b> <b>Tape</b> B was poly vinyl chloride tape coated with a rubber <b>adhesive.</b> <b>Tape</b> C was polyethylene film coated with an acrylic adhesive. Results: For all tapes used, the maximal peel force occurred at peel angle 30 °. The peel forces at 30 ° were three times the minimal peel forces which were observed at 90 ° to 120 ° for Tape A, 120 ° to 170 ° for Tape B, and 90 ° to 150 ° for Tape C. Conclusion : These findings suggest that a peel angle near 120 ° might be commonly good for less irritation...|$|R

40|$|Kinesio taping (KT) {{may be a}} new {{treatment}} in patients with myofascial trigger points (MTrPs). A new method available for taping practitioners is cross taping (CT). The main objective was to determine how CT, KT, and <b>medical</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> (sham group) affect the subjective assessment of resting bioelectrical activity and pain of the upper trapezius muscle (UT) in patients with MTrPs. 105 volunteers were recruited to participate. The primary outcome was resting bioelectrical activity of UT muscle as assessed by surface electromyography (sEMG) in each group and pain intensity on a visual analog scale (VAS). Assessments were collected before and after intervention and after the 24 -hours follow-up. No significant differences were observed in bioelectrical activity of UT between pre-, post-, and follow-up results. In three groups patients had significantly lower pain VAS score after the intervention (CT—p< 0. 001, KT—p< 0. 001, and sham—p< 0. 01). The Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA showed {{no significant differences in}} almost all measurements between groups. The application of all three types of tapes does not influence the resting bioelectrical activity of UT muscle and may not lead to a reduction in muscle tone in the case of MTrPs...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effect of the}} peel angle of <b>medical</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> on the mitigation of skin irritation in young adult women, ages 21 to 23 years. In 10 subjects, 8 segments of acrylic adhesive tape were placed on both thighs and peeled off 24 hours later at 6 different angles (30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 degrees). The data consisted of the amount of stratum corneum stripped off, the peel force, degree of pain, and redness. (1) The peel force required to strip the adhesive tape off at 30 and 60 degrees respectively was significantly greater than that required to strip the tape off at the other angles. (2) The amount of stratum corneum stripped away did not differ significantly among the 6 peel angles. There was no correlation between the peel force and the amount of stripped corneocytes. (3) There were absolute differences in the degree of pain and redness between sharp (30 - 60 degrees) and blunt angles (90 - 180 degrees). In conclusion, peeling at 90 - 120 degrees was effective in reducing peel force and the degree of pain...|$|E
40|$|Colophony is a well-recognized {{cause of}} {{allergic}} contact dermatitis (ACD) in athletes because of its use in many sports (bowling, baseball, gymnastics, etc.) to enhance grip and it represents a known cause of ACD to <b>adhesive</b> <b>medical</b> <b>tapes.</b> Inspite of this, ACD to colophony from protective <b>adhesive</b> finger <b>taping</b> used by volleyball players {{does not appear in}} literature. It may be argued that the actual occurrence of ACD to colophony contained in protective <b>adhesive</b> finger <b>taping</b> could be underestimated as many cases may be misdiagnosed and patch tests are not always performed.

50|$|One of the {{characteristic}} {{features of the}} Rough Collie is its head. This is light {{in relation to the}} rest of the body, and resembles a blunted wedge tapering smoothly from ears to black nose, with a distinct stop and parallel head planes. The muzzle is well rounded, and never square. There is considerable variation in the colour of the head, however. The eyes are medium-sized and almond shaped. The ears are supposed to be semi-prick, with the upper third folded over. Ears which do not 'tip' properly are fairly common, and many collies have their ears taped as puppies (using <b>medical</b> <b>adhesive</b> or paper <b>tape)</b> to encourage them to lay properly - no cutting or surgery is involved. They are similar to a Shetland Sheepdog's, but larger.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{accuracy}} of three copro-microscopic techniques for helminth diagnosis: Kato-Katz, <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> and FLOTAC. A total of 163 children from a peri-urban municipality near Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, participated and submitted multiple stool samples and <b>adhesive</b> <b>tapes.</b> Ninety children supplied at least two stool samples and two <b>adhesive</b> <b>tapes.</b> Three stool samples and three <b>adhesive</b> <b>tapes</b> were available from 71 and 64 children, respectively. From each stool sample, a single Kato-Katz thick smear was prepared and examined quantitatively. Additionally, the first stool sample was subjected to the FLOTAC technique and helminth eggs were counted. <b>Adhesive</b> <b>tapes</b> were checked for the presence of Enterobius vermicularis eggs. Using pooled results as a diagnostic 'gold' standard, the prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides, E. vermicularis, Hymenolepis nana and Dicrocoelium dendriticum were 54. 4 %, 13. 3 %, 11. 1 % and 11. 1 %, respectively. Infection intensities were low. When compared to triplicate Kato-Katz, a single FLOTAC was more sensitive for the diagnosis of A. lumbricoides (89. 5 % versus 39. 5 %) and D. dendriticum (88. 9 % versus 33. 3 %), but less sensitive for H. nana (66. 7 % versus 88. 9 %). For E. vermicularis, three <b>adhesive</b> <b>tapes</b> showed much higher sensitivity than a single FLOTAC (92. 9 % versus 14. 3 %). FLOTAC yielded significantly higher faecal egg counts than Kato-Katz for A. lumbricoides and D. dendriticum.

In the case that the peeling forces of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> increase as the peeling speeds increase, the pick-up time decreased as the needle displacement increased.
