50|$|In some anglophone countries, {{the degree}} <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>Research</b> is an {{advanced}} postgraduate research degree {{in a specific}} academic discipline. At some universities, the conferred degree is called the Master of Arts by Research or Master of Science by Research in a specific academic discipline of Science or Social Sciences. The <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>Research</b> degree is usually abbreviated as MRes whereas the Master of Arts by Research is often abbreviated as MARes or MA(Res), while the Master of Science by Research is sometimes abbreviated as MSc(Res) or MScRes.|$|E

50|$|This type {{of course}} is also useful if the student is {{considering}} {{a career in the}} commercial world where research is a key focus but a PhD is not specifically required. Additionally, if the student is unsure whether a PhD is right or not, a <b>Master's</b> <b>of</b> <b>Research</b> degree can give the useful experience of what studying for a doctorate might be like, whilst at the same time allowing the student to earn a valuable Master's level qualification.|$|R
50|$|A {{small number}} of {{business}} schools also offer a more specialized <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> Marketing <b>Research</b> (MMR) degree. An MMR typically prepares students {{for a wide range}} <b>of</b> <b>research</b> methodologies and focuses on learning both in the classroom and the field.|$|R

In Australia, the MRes degree was first introduced at Macquarie University. In most cases, the degree is designed to prepare students for doctoral research. For universities with significant strengths in Practice-led research, a research Master's degree preparation provides an opportunity for understanding the nature and potential <b>of</b> <b>research</b> study through, for example, art and design practice.|$|R
50|$|In 1968, the Centre of Mathematical Morphology (CMM) of the École des Mines de Paris {{was created}} (after 1979, {{it was called}} Centre of Geostatistics and Mathematical Morphology). Matheron was named director, and Serra was hired as <b>master</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> ("Maître de Recherches") and {{assistant}} director.

50|$|Regulations {{governing}} {{the progression of}} undergraduate degree graduates to postgraduate programmes vary among universities, and are often flexible. A candidate for a postgraduate master's degree is usually required {{to have at least}} a 2:2 bachelor honours degree, although candidates with 2:1s are in a considerably stronger position to gain a place in a postgraduate course and to obtain funding, especially in medical and natural sciences. Some institutions specify a 2:1 minimum for certain types of master's program, such as for a <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>Research</b> course.|$|E
5000|$|Research master's degrees are {{primarily}} research based, although may contain taught elements, particularly on research methods. Examples are the MPhil (always a research degree, often {{linked to a}} doctoral programme), MLitt (usually, but not always a research degree) and Master's by Research. They aim to prepare students fit research careers. Care should be taken not to confuse the Master by Research (MbyRes, MRes or ResM), which is a research degree in a specific subject, with the <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>Research</b> (MRes), which is a taught degree concentrating on research methods.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Master</b> <b>of</b> Science (by <b>Research)</b> is {{characterized}} by a research component in the curriculum. MS prepares the student in conducting managerially relevant <b>research</b> in areas <b>of</b> management.|$|R
50|$|The school {{offers two}} {{undergraduate}} coursework programs, combined undergraduate programs with science, arts, commerce or law, a <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> Engineering Science postgraduate coursework program, and three <b>research</b> programs:- <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> Philosophy, <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> Engineering by <b>Research</b> and a Doctor of Philosophy.|$|R
50|$|The Sydney Law School {{offers the}} {{professional}} degrees of Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) (combined with another bachelor's degree) for undergraduate-entry, and the Juris Doctor (J.D.) for graduate-entry.

50|$|In most respects, the {{criteria}} for awarding qualifications at honours level and above {{are the same as}} {{in the rest of the}} UK (see above under England, Wales and Northern Ireland). Postgraduate qualifications are not designated Master of Arts as in the rest of the UK, as this is an undergraduate degree. Postgraduate degrees in arts and humanities subjects are usually designated Master of Letters (M.Litt) or, in natural and social sciences, Master of Science (M.Sc). Non-doctoral postgraduate research degrees are usually designated Master of Philosophy (M.Phil) or <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>Research</b> (M.Res). The postgraduate teaching qualification is the postgraduate diploma in Education (PGDE).|$|E

50|$|In Belgium and the Netherlands, the M.Phil. is {{a special}} {{research}} degree, and is only awarded by selected departments of a university (mostly {{in the fields of}} arts, social sciences, archaeology, philosophy and theology). Admission to these programmes is highly selective and primarily aimed at those students aiming for an academic career. After finishing these programmes, students normally enroll in a Ph.D. programme. The Dutch Department of Education, Culture and Science has decided not to recognize the MPhil degree. Accordingly, some Dutch universities have decided to continue to offer MPhil programs, though award the legally-recognized <b>Master</b> <b>of</b> <b>Research</b> degrees, as the MA(Res) or MSc(Res).|$|E
