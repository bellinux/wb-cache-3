25|$|Unlike the componential <b>model,</b> <b>construction</b> grammar {{denies any}} strict {{distinction}} between the two and proposes a syntax-lexicon continuum. The argument goes that words and complex constructions are both pairs of form and meaning and differ only in internal symbolic complexity. Instead of being discrete modules and thus subject to very different processes they form the extremes of a continuum (from regular to idiosyncratic): syntax>subcategorization frame>idiom>morphology>syntactic category>word/lexicon (these are the traditional terms; construction grammars use a different terminology).|$|E
25|$|The {{homology}} modeling procedure can {{be broken}} down into four sequential steps: template selection, target-template alignment, <b>model</b> <b>construction,</b> and model assessment. The first two steps are often essentially performed together, as the most common methods of identifying templates rely on the production of sequence alignments; however, these alignments may not be of sufficient quality because database search techniques prioritize speed over alignment quality. These processes can be performed iteratively {{to improve the quality of}} the final model, although quality assessments that are not dependent on the true target structure are still under development process.|$|E

25|$|An {{upper limit}} {{to the number of}} {{considered}} candidate models is typically set by the substantial effort required to define the models and to choose between many alternative options. There is no commonly accepted ABC-specific procedure for <b>model</b> <b>construction,</b> so experience and prior knowledge are used instead. Although more robust procedures for a priori model choice and formulation would be beneficial, there is no one-size-fits-all strategy for model development in statistics: sensible characterization of complex systems will always necessitate a great deal of detective work and use of expert knowledge from the problem domain.|$|E

These research questions guided the development of the study that led us to document the process exhibited by high school teachers to model mathematical situations dynamically. In particular, there is evidence that the use of computational tools helped them identify and explore a set of mathematical relations dynamically.

40|$|Construction {{duration}} {{is one of}} the {{key elements}} to determine the success of a project. Several models have been developed to provide precise predictions of construction duration. The datasets in previous studies comprise observations from particular countries. This precludes examination of the role of project location at the country level for <b>modelling</b> <b>construction</b> duration. The aim, therefore, is to test the statistical adequacy of categorizing projects with respect to their locations for <b>modelling</b> <b>construction</b> duration. A formal procedure to evaluate the adequacy of categorizing observations is also presented. It is intended to contribute to the epistemology of <b>modelling</b> <b>construction</b> duration. The dataset was generated from a global client. It contains information on 246 projects from 25 different countries. This creates a categorical variable for location. Bromilow’s time–cost model is chosen to assess the adequacy of this categorization. A full model with indicator and interaction variables is compared to a restricted one. Parameter estimation was performed according to the ordinary least squares method. F‐statistics are calculated and the probability of the value is significant. The results show that two distinct groups with substantial changes in model parameters exist in the dataset. It is also noted that conclusions are valid over the selected population.
