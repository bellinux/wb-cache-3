6000|$|But {{the only}} thing to be {{considered}} here is this--what kind of oil is used at coronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor <b>macassar</b> <b>oil,</b> nor castor oil, nor bear's oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil. What then can it possibly be, but the sperm oil in its unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils? ...|$|E

An artless and unsophisticated girl is so truly amiable, that I often wish Amelia was more like her sister!’ ...|$|E
6000|$|In a gale of wind, {{when all}} hands are called and the deck swarms with men, the little [...] "middies" [...] running about distracted and having nothing {{particular}} to do, {{make it up}} in vociferous swearing; exploding all about under foot like torpedoes. Some of them are terrible little boys, cocking their cups at alarming angles, and looking fierce as young roosters. They are generally great consumers of <b>Macassar</b> <b>oil</b> and the Balm of Columbia; they thirst and rage after whiskers; and sometimes, applying their ointments, lay themselves out in the sun, to promote the fertility of their chins.|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as the}} {{governor}} had signed the bill, I invested my whole estate in the purchase of Toms and Tabbies. At first I could only afford to feed them upon mice (which are cheap), but they fulfilled the scriptural injunction at so marvellous a rate, that I at length considered it my best policy to be liberal, and so indulged them in oysters and turtle. Their tails, at a legislative price, now bring me in a good income; for I have discovered a way, in which, by means of <b>Macassar</b> <b>oil,</b> I can force three crops in a year. It delights me to find, too, that the animals soon get accustomed to the thing, and would rather have the appendages cut off than otherwise. I consider myself, therefore, a made man, and am bargaining for a country seat on the Hudson.|$|E
6000|$|... "What, sir, to {{say nothing}} more, can one be forever dealing in <b>macassar</b> <b>oil,</b> hair dyes, cosmetics, false moustaches, wigs, and toupees, and still believe that men are wholly what they look to be? What think you, sir, are a {{thoughtful}} barber's reflections, when, behind a careful curtain, he shaves the thin, dead stubble off a head, and then dismisses it to the world, radiant in curling auburn? To contrast the shamefaced air behind the curtain, the fearful {{looking forward to being}} possibly discovered there by a prying acquaintance, with the cheerful assurance and challenging pride with which the same man steps forth again, a gay deception, into the street, while some honest, shock-headed fellow humbly gives him the wall! Ah, sir, they may talk of the courage of truth, but my trade teaches me that truth sometimes is sheepish. Lies, lies, sir, brave lies are the lions!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Yes, it wasn’t very pleasant,’ {{replied the}} small host. ‘The fact is, Fanny’s {{father and mother}} liked me well enough as an individual, but had a decided {{objection}} to my becoming a husband. You see, I hadn’t any money in those days, and they had; and so they wanted Fanny to pick up somebody else. However, we managed to discover the state of each other’s affections somehow. I used to meet her, at some mutual friends’ parties; at first we danced together, and talked, and flirted, and {{all that sort of}} thing; then, I used to like nothing so well as sitting by her side—we didn’t talk so much then, but I remember I used to have a great notion of looking at her out of the extreme corner of my left eye—and then I got very miserable and sentimental, and began to write verses, and use <b>Macassar</b> <b>oil.</b> At last I couldn’t bear it any longer, and after I had walked up and down the sunny side of Oxford-street in tight boots for a week—and a devilish hot summer it was too—in the hope of meeting her, I sat down and wrote a letter, and begged her to manage to see me clandestinely, for I wanted to hear her decision from her own mouth. I said I had discovered, to my perfect satisfaction, that I couldn’t live without her, and that if she didn’t have me, I had made up my mind to take prussic acid, or take to drinking, or emigrate, so as to take myself off in some way or other. Well, I borrowed a pound, and bribed the housemaid to give her the note, which she did.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{describing}} of {{all these}} persons does not advance Morgiana's story much. But, perhaps, some country readers are not acquainted with the class of persons by whose printed opinions they are guided, and are simple enough to imagine that mere merit will make a reputation on the stage or elsewhere. The making of a theatrical success {{is a much more}} complicated and curious thing than such persons fancy it to be. Immense are the pains taken to get a good word from Mr. This of the Star, or Mr. That of the Courier, to propitiate the favour of the critic of the day, and get the editors of the metropolis into a good humour,--above all, to have the name of the person to be puffed perpetually before the public. Artists cannot be advertised like <b>Macassar</b> <b>oil</b> or blacking, and they want it to the full as much; hence endless ingenuity must be practised {{in order to keep the}} popular attention awake. Suppose a great actor moves from London to Windsor, the Brentford Champion must state that [...] "Yesterday Mr. Blazes and suite passed rapidly through our city; the celebrated comedian is engaged, we hear, at Windsor, to give some of his inimitable readings of our great national bard to the MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AUDIENCE in the realm." [...] This piece of intelligence the Hammersmith Observer will question the next week, as thus:--"A contemporary, the Brentford Champion, says that Blazes is engaged to give Shakspearian readings at Windsor to [...] "the most illustrious audience in the realm." [...] We question this fact very much. We would, indeed, that it were true; but the MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AUDIENCE in the realm prefer FOREIGN melodies to THE NATIVE WOOD-NOTES WILD of the sweet song-bird of Avon. Mr. Blazes is simply gone to Eton, where his son, Master Massinger Blazes, is suffering, we regret to hear, under a severe attack of the chicken-pox. This complaint (incident to youth) has raged, we understand, with frightful virulence in Eton School." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Catherine, then, was a franche coquette, and Mr. John Hayes was miserable. His {{life was}} passed in a storm of mean passions and bitter jealousies, and desperate attacks upon the indifference-rock of Mrs. Catherine's heart, which not all his tempest of love could beat down. O cruel cruel pangs of love unrequited! Mean rogues feel {{them as well as}} great heroes. Lives there the man in Europe who has not felt them many times?--who has not knelt, and fawned, and supplicated, and wept, and cursed, and raved, all in vain; and passed long wakeful nights with ghosts of dead hopes for company; shadows of buried remembrances that glide out of their graves of nights, and whisper, [...] "We are dead now, but we WERE once; and we made you happy, and we come now to mock you:--despair, O lover, despair, and die"?--O cruel pangs!--dismal nights!--Now a sly demon creeps under your nightcap, and drops into your ear those soft hope-breathing sweet words, uttered on the well-remembered evening: there, in the drawer of your dressing-table (along with the razors, and <b>Macassar</b> <b>oil),</b> lies the dead flower that Lady Amelia Wilhelmina wore in her bosom on the night of a certain ball--the corpse of a glorious hope that seemed once as if it would live for ever, so strong was it, so full of joy and sunshine: there, in your writing-desk, among a crowd of unpaid bills, is the dirty scrap of paper, thimble-sealed, which came in company with a pair of muffetees of her {{knitting}} (she was a butcher's daughter, and did all she could, poor thing!), begging [...] "you would ware them at collidge, and think of her who"--married a public-house three weeks afterwards, and cares for you no more now than she does for the pot-boy. But why multiply instances, or seek to depict the agony of poor mean-spirited John Hayes? No mistake can be greater than that of fancying such great emotions of love are only felt by virtuous or exalted men: depend upon it, Love, like Death, plays havoc among the pauperum tabernas, and sports with rich and poor, wicked and virtuous, alike. I have often fancied, for instance, on seeing the haggard pale young old-clothesman, who wakes the echoes of our street with his nasal cry of [...] "Clo'!"--I have often, I said, fancied that, besides the load of exuvial coats and breeches under which he staggers, there is another weight on him--an atrior cura at his tail--and while his unshorn lips and nose together are performing that mocking, boisterous, Jack-indifferent cry of [...] "Clo', clo'!" [...] who knows what woeful utterances are crying from the heart within? There he is, chaffering with the footman at No. 7 about an old dressing-gown: you think his whole soul is bent only on the contest about the garment. Psha! there is, perhaps, some faithless girl in Holywell Street who fills up his heart; and that desultory Jew-boy is a peripatetic hell! Take another instance:--take the man in the beef-shop in Saint Martin's Court. There he is, to all appearances quite calm: before the same round of beef--from morning till sundown--for hundreds of years very likely. Perhaps when the shutters are closed, and all the world tired and silent, there is HE silent, but untired--cutting, cutting, cutting. You enter, you get your meat to your liking, you depart; and, quite unmoved, on, on he goes, reaping ceaselessly the Great Harvest of Beef. You would fancy that if Passion ever failed to conquer, it had in vain assailed the calm bosom of THAT MAN. I doubt it, and would give much to know his history.|$|E
5000|$|For centuries, natural oils {{have been}} used to {{condition}} human hair. [...] A conditioner popular with men in the late Victorian era was <b>Macassar</b> <b>Oil,</b> but this product was quite greasy and required pinning a small cloth, known as an antimacassar, to chairs and sofas to keep the upholstery from being damaged by the <b>Macassar</b> <b>Oil.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Macassar</b> <b>oil</b> is a {{compounded}} oil {{used primarily}} by men in Victorian and Edwardian {{times as a}} hair conditioner to groom and style the hair.|$|E
50|$|During the Victorian era, {{the use of}} the unguent <b>Macassar</b> <b>Oil</b> on {{the hair}} became so popular that the Antimacassar was invented to prevent damage to furniture.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Macassar</b> <b>oil</b> {{is often}} made with coconut oil or palm oil {{or that of}} Schleichera oleosa, [...] {{combined}} with ylang-ylang oil (obtained by processing the flowers of the ylang-ylang tree, Cananga odorata) and other fragrant oils.|$|E
50|$|The words <b>Macassar</b> <b>Oil</b> were {{registered}} as a trademark by A. Rowland & Sons, in 1888. Rowland's son (also named Alexander) later stated that a relative {{living in the}} island of Celebes in the Dutch East Indies had helped in procurement of the basic ingredient.|$|E
5000|$|An {{antimacassar}} [...] {{is a small}} cloth {{placed over}} the backs or arms of chairs, or the head or cushions of a sofa, to prevent soiling of the permanent fabric. The name also refers to the cloth flap 'collar' on a sailor's shirt or top, used to keep <b>macassar</b> <b>oil</b> off the uniform.|$|E
50|$|Some {{species of}} Maple and Buckeye are valued for their wood, while several other genera, such as Koelreuteria, Cardiospermum and Ungnadia, are popular ornamentals. Schleichera trijuga {{is the source}} of Indian <b>macassar</b> <b>oil.</b> Saponins {{extracted}} from the drupe of Sapindus species are effective surfactants and are used commercially in cosmetics and detergents.|$|E
50|$|Born in Clapham, London, Henrietta Octavia Weston Rowland {{lost her}} mother (Henrietta Monica Margaretta Ditges) {{at an early}} age. Her father, Alexander William Rowland, a wealthy {{businessman}} associated with the <b>Macassar</b> <b>Oil</b> Company, raised her and seven siblings at their London home and a country house in Kent, where she developed a lifelong appreciation of country pursuits.|$|E
50|$|It was popularised by Alexander Rowland (1747-1823), {{a celebrated}} London barber. It was then not {{uncommon}} for barbers {{to make their own}} hair preparations, and around 1783 Rowland began offering Rowland's <b>Macassar</b> <b>Oil.</b> Within two decades it had become hugely popular, and was aggressively advertised with extravagant claims of its effectiveness, becoming one of the first nationally advertised products.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Macassar</b> <b>oil</b> was {{so named}} because it was reputed to have been {{manufactured}} from ingredients purchased in the port of Makassar in Indonesia. The poet Byron facetiously called it [...] "thine incomparable oil, Macassar" [...] in the first canto of Don Juan, and Lewis Carroll also mentions [...] "Rowland's Macassar Oil" [...] in the poem [...] "Haddocks' Eyes" [...] from Through the Looking-Glass.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Macassar</b> <b>oil</b> was an unguent for {{the hair}} {{commonly}} used by {{men in the}} early 19th century. The poet Byron called it [...] "thine incomparable oil, Macassar". The fashion for oiled hair became so widespread in the Victorian and the Edwardian period that housewives began to cover the arms and backs of their chairs with washable cloths to preserve the fabric coverings from being soiled. Around 1850, these started {{to be known as}} antimacassars. They were also installed in theatres, from 1865.|$|E
40|$|As {{a museum}} professional, I work with memories. And {{nothing is more}} evocative than scent, {{which is at the}} same time both fragile and powerful. Perfumed {{textiles}} and costume are a standard part of every culture, yet few objects have been identified, and virtually none have been preserved. Perfuming was traditionally used to mask bad odors from use or from production processes like tanning and dyeing, for ceremonial reasons, or simply to create a favorable impression of the wearer. Perfuming methods included using incense, laundry aids, sweet bags, fragrant oils and fuming pans. Unintentional perfuming also occurred, of which we sometimes get a whiff in our museum collections. Years of research have shown that museums and archives hold the key to this largely forgotten, intangible art. Inventories, tailors’ bills, wardrobe lists, doctors’ accounts, custom duties and other historical sources provide scattered but reliable bits of information about perfuming textiles. I began this line of inquiry as a reminder to conservators that they must also learn to recognize and preserve scented textiles, but this work constitutes not only a new discipline but also an immediately appealing, inspiring and thought-provoking aspect for anyone interested in textiles. A professional perfumer and I have collaborated on recreating a series of scents, so we can now experience first-hand the smell of Henry VIII’s perfumed shirts, Indian shawls redolent of patchouli, Casanova’s handkerchief, the <b>macassar</b> <b>oil</b> left on men’s hatbands and furniture, fragrant Japanese wedding kimonos, Paul Poiret’s gowns sprayed with the first designer perfume in 1920, as well as modern technology’s nano- and microcapsules embedding synthetic scent in athletic socks, business suits, and baby clothes...|$|E
