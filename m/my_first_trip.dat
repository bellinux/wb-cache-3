2500|$|The track [...] "Riding the Crest", {{named by}} Paul Waaktaar-Savoy as [...] "an electro-blues", is heavily {{inspired}} by Arcade Fire and their album Neon Bible. Being the principal songwriter on the album, Waaktaar-Savoy also got {{inspired by his}} changing surroundings, dividing his time between New York City and Oslo. [...] "“Shadowside“ feels quite Norwegian in the melody, the chords and the mood. [...] "The Bandstand" [...] reminds me of <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>trip</b> to New York City in the early '80s, before A-ha were famous. Songs are like a photo-album – they can really send you back. And this one reminds me of arriving at Port Authority with [...] in my pocket, sporting really high, yellow, almost see-through synthesizer-hair, wearing a tiger-shirt and a brown suit, looking like an alien!" [...] The title track, [...] "Foot of the Mountain" [...] – examines {{one of the fundamental}} conflicts of modern life, the pull between nature and big-city civilization: for Paul, the buzz of New York City versus the beauty and isolation of Norway: [...] "It's the dilemma of loving a city life, yet secretly wondering if we'd be happier being surrounded by open fields and sweeping mountains." [...] "Real Meaning" [...] is inspired by Waaktaar-Savoy calling home only to be greeted by his answering machine. The idea behind [...] "Start the Simulator" [...] was to make a heartfelt song using technical language: [...] "The basic idea was to make a song using only technical terms and phrases, and still make it very emotional and personal. There is such poetry in the old Apollo manuals: [...] "switch to Omni Bravo" [...] and [...] "the bright ejector blanket." [...] The latter should probably be [...] "ejecta blanket." ...|$|E

40|$|CEE-GS is a {{place for}} {{graduate}} students to connect with each other, share ideas and grow together as professionals. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> CEE conference was in New York City in 2010. Not only was this <b>my</b> <b>first</b> solo conference, this was <b>my</b> <b>first</b> solo <b>trip,</b> period. Go big or go home, right? I was already feeling nervous and apprehensive as I was making the transition from being a full time eighth grade teacher to a full time graduate student. As such, I was struggling to find my new home. I needn’t have worried, for instantly I was welcomed into the CEE-GS community. I made connections with other graduate students from across the country and realized that none of us is in this program alone. Though sometimes our work may feel isolating, we return to each other each year to connect, to collaborate, to inspire. I clearly remember <b>my</b> <b>first</b> social dinner with the CEE-GS. I looked around the table and realized that I was sitting among the very people that I would be working with {{for the rest of my}} career. It was such a surreal moment in which I could clearly envision collaborating on future workshops and articles with my new English Education family. In that moment, all of my insecurities evaporated. I knew I had found my new home. Each year our community continues to grow. I am still marveling that we all packed into Bilbo Baggins for dinner in DC last month! As membership grows, so do our opportunities to both collaborate and commiserate along each step of our unique journey that is graduate school, celebrating each other through each step of the process and growing as a family. This summer CEE will once again meet in New York City at Fordham University. I am excited to return to where, for me, it all started and to meet new members. We will have a graduate student day on Thursday, July 9 in which we will offer workshops specifically catered towards the needs of our CEE-GS members. Please make plans to attend. In my opinion, while NCTE is a great conference, CEE is takes that same commitment to education and camaraderie and magnifies it b...|$|R

40|$|On <b>my</b> <b>first</b> {{consulting}} <b>trip</b> to Peru in 1994, I told a {{group of}} assembled government dignitaries that my goal was that the child of a weaver would choose to become a weaver when offered the choice of a good factory job. 1 This means that the weaver should be elevated from the humble place he occupied and be compensated for his skills to at least the level of unskilled industrial labor. As a weaver myself, I wanted to see the long illustrious tradition of weaving in Peru continue and thrive. As a consultant in crafts development, I envisioned a variety of markets opening up for all Peruvian crafts as this country emerged from a period of isolation imposed by terrorists. As I have worked with people in other counties, my belief has strengthened that traditional craft skills will only be preserved if craftspeople can sell what they make. While it may be nice to have objects preserved in museums, scholars studying the place of crafts in cultures, and craft artists in developed countries replicating techniques, I would like to have descendants making objects with their hands in the place where the skills originated. Continuation of textile techniques in the area where they began will only occur if craftspeople can make a decent living. Otherwise children will leave the rural countryside where most traditional crafts survive and will seek employment in the cities. For preservation to happen markets will need to be developed and products designed which utilize the traditional hand processes. While thi...|$|R

The King had a hundred warriors with him, 12 or 15 women, and 23 canoes and two boats.

That made a big difference, and we had vile weather: gales dead ahead, snow, and bitter cold. The galley fire was washed out half the time, the deckhouse we lived in was flooded continually; for weeks we hadn’t a rag of dry clothes, and very seldom a plateful of warm food. It was a merciful relief when the gale freshened, and she lay hove to, with the icy seas bursting over her weather bow while we slept like logs in our soaking bunks; but that wasn’t often. With each shift or fall of wind we crawled out on the yards, wet and frozen to the bone, to shake the hard canvas loose, and, as it generally happened, were sent aloft in an hour to furl it tight again. Each time it was a short-handed fight for life to master the thrashing sail. Our hands cracked open, and the cuts would not heal; stores were spoiled by the water that washed over everything, and some days we starved on a wet biscuit or two; but the demand for brutal effort never slackened. We were worn very thin when we squared away for the north with the first fair wind.” ...|$|E

And I didn't do badly either, since I managed not to sink that {{steamboat}} on <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>trip.</b> It's a wonder to me yet. Imagine a blindfolded man set to drive a van over a bad road. I sweated and shivered over that business considerably, I can tell you. After all, for a seaman, to scrape the bottom of the thing that's supposed to float all the time under his care is the unpardonable sin. No one may know of it, but you never forget the thump--eh? A blow on the very heart. You remember it, you dream of it, you wake up at night and think of it--years after--and go hot and cold all over. I don't pretend to say that steamboat floated all the time. More than once she had to wade for a bit, with twenty cannibals splashing around and pushing. We had enlisted some of these chaps on the way for a crew. Fine fellows--cannibals--in their place. They were men one could work with, and I am grateful to them. And, after all, they did not eat each other before my face: they had brought along a provision of hippo-meat which went rotten, and made the mystery of the wilderness stink in my nostrils. Phoo! I can sniff it now. I had the manager on board and three or four pilgrims with their staves--all complete. Sometimes we came upon a station close by the bank, clinging to the skirts of the unknown, and the white men rushing out of a tumble-down hovel, with great gestures of joy and surprise and welcome, seemed very strange,--had the appearance of being held there captive by a spell. The word ivory would ring in the air for a while--and on we went again into the silence, along empty reaches, round the still bends, between the high walls of our winding way, reverberating in hollow claps the ponderous beat of the stern-wheel. Trees, trees, millions of trees, massive, immense, running up high; and at their foot, hugging the bank against the stream, crept the little begrimed steamboat, like a sluggish beetle crawling on the floor of a lofty portico. It made you feel very small, very lost, and yet it was not altogether depressing, that feeling. After all, if you were small, the grimy beetle crawled on--which was just what you wanted it to do. Where the pilgrims imagined it crawled to I don't know. To some place where they expected to get something, I bet! For me it crawled toward Kurtz--exclusively; but when the steam-pipes started leaking we crawled very slow. The reaches opened before us and closed behind, as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water to bar the way for our return. We penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness. It was very quiet there. At night sometimes the roll of drums behind the curtain of trees would run up the river and remain sustained faintly, as if hovering in the air high over our heads, till the first break of day. Whether it meant war, peace, or prayer we could not tell. The dawns were heralded by the descent of a chill stillness; the woodcutters slept, their fires burned low; the snapping of a twig would make you start. We were wanderers on a prehistoric earth, on an earth that wore the aspect of an unknown planet. We could have fancied ourselves the first of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance, to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil. But suddenly, as we struggled round a bend, there would be a glimpse of rush walls, of peaked grass-roofs, a burst of yells, a whirl of black limbs, a mass of hands clapping, of feet stamping, of bodies swaying, of eyes rolling, under the droop of heavy and motionless foliage. The steamer toiled along slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy. The prehistoric man was cursing us, praying to us, welcoming us--who could tell? We were cut off from the comprehension of our surroundings; we glided past like phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as sane men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse. We could not understand, because we were too far and could not remember, because we were traveling in the night of first ages, of those ages that are gone, leaving hardly a sign--and no memories.|$|E
