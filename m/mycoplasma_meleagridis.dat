40|$|International audienceMycoplasma meleagridis {{infection}} is widespread in turkeys, causing poor growth and feathering, airsacculitis, osteodystrophy, and reduction in hatchability. Like most <b>mycoplasma</b> species, M. <b>meleagridis</b> {{is characterized by}} its inability to synthesize purine and pyrimidine nucleotides de novo. Consistent with this intrinsic deficiency, we here report the cloning, expression, and characterization of a M. meleagridis gene sequence encoding a major surface nuclease, referred to as Mm 19. Mm 19 consists of a 1941 -bp ORF encodinga 646 -amino-acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 74, 825 kDa. BLASTP analysis revealed a significant match with the catalytic/dimerization domain of type II restriction enzymes of the RE-AlwI superfamily. This {{finding is consistent with}} the genomic location of Mm 19 sequence, which dispalys characteristics of a typical type II restriction-modification locus. Like intact M. meleagridis cells, the E. coli-expressed Mm 19 fusion product was found to exhibit a nuclease activity against plasmid DNA, double-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA, and RNA. The Mm 19 -associated nuclease activity was consistently enhanced with Mg 2 + divalent cations, a hallmark of type II restriction enzymes. A rabbit hyperimmune antiserum raised against the bacterially expressed Mm 19 strongly reacted with M. meleagridis intact cells and fully neutralized the surface-bound nuclease activity. Collectively, the results show that M. meleagridis expresses a strong surface-bound nuclease activity, which {{is the product of a}} single gene sequence that is related to the RE-AlwI superfamily of endonucleases. © 2016 Yacoub, Ben Abdelmoumen Mardassi.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{great number}} of turkey {{hatcheries}} are using tylosin tartrate in a dipping procedure to control egg transmitted Mycoplasma sp. (PPLO), primarily <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>meleagridis.</b> A quaternary ammonium compound is commonly used as a sanitizer and solution preservative.

40|$|<b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>meleagridis</b> {{appears to}} {{localize}} {{primarily in the}} respiratory tissues of the developing turkey embryo. This {{was determined by the}} daily collection throughout the incubation period of smears of embryonic tissues from 261 fertile turkey eggs. The tissues were examined using fluorescent antibody procedures and the earliest detection from positive tissues were: day 6, blastoderm (10 %); day 8, sinus (44 %) and peritoneum (55 %); day 19, lung (11 %) and trachea (44 %); day 23, air sacs (62 %) ...|$|E

All species grew over a pH range that was generally about two units. The most significant finding was that cultures initiated in media within a pH range of approximately 8. 5 to 8. 9 remained viable for 45 to 60 days at 37 C, whereas cultures initiated at lower values survived for shorter periods...|$|E
40|$|A thin-layer {{chromatography}} {{technique was}} used to study the arginine metabolism of <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>meleagridis.</b> The technique reflected the enzyme activity of the dihydrolase pathway through detection of readily visible end products on X-ray film.

40|$|Losses due to {{skeletal}} disorders {{varied from}} 1. 8 to 6. 1 percent in five flocks, varying {{in size from}} 2040 to 7033 birds, of broad breasted white tom turkeys. Very little evidence of significant air-sacculitis due to <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>meleagridis</b> was found in hatching poults or during the growing period. Major disorders causing the losses included rickets, rotated tibia, arthritis/osteomyelitis and long bone distortion. Rickets and arthritis/osteomyelitis due to infection with Staphylococcus aureus were significant problems only in one flock each, while rotated tibia caused significant losses in three flocks. Long bone distortion was the major cause of economic loss and occurred in all flocks. Possible causes of long bone distortion are briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{recombinant}} {{phage library}} harbouring <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>meleagridis</b> (MM) genomic DNA fragments was {{generated in the}} bacteriophage lambda gt 11 expression vector. The library was screened for expression of MM specific antigens with a polyclonal antiserum that had been preadsorbed with antigens {{of the most common}} unrelated avian mycoplasma species. A 49 -aminoacid antigenic domain unique to MM was isolated, expressed in Escherichia coli, and its serodiagnostic potential was demonstrated. An antiserum raised against this MM-specific antigenic domain recognized a cluster of seven membrane-associated MM proteins with molecular masses ranging from 34 to 75 kDa. Overall, this study resulted in the identification of a potent serodiagnostic tool and revealed the complex antigenic nature of MM. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|<b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>meleagridis,</b> {{a turkey}} pathogen, can be {{detected}} by PCR directly from tracheal or genital swabs. However, up to 40 % samples may contain inhibitory substances. A DNA fragment, that can be amplified with M. meleagridis primers {{and in the same}} cycling conditions, was constructed to use as an internal control (IC) to check for these inhibitors. This IC can easily be distinguished from the M. meleagridis amplicon after agarose gel electrophoresis since it is longer. Use of this IC in PCR amplifications revealed that more than 35 % of turkey tracheal swabs and more than 45 % of turkey cloacal swabs contained inhibitors. In most cases, dilution (1 : 100) of swab lysates allowed amplification of the internal control but DNA purification may be necessary to eliminate inhibitors (20 % of tracheal swabs and 5 % of cloacal swabs). Use of this internal control DNA allowed assessment of the efficiency of each individual reaction and ensured that the reaction was not inhibited by interfering substances...|$|E
40|$|Immunoblotting {{was used}} to check the {{antigenic}} profiling of 27 <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>meleagridis</b> strains isolated in different countries. Hyperimmune polyclonal rabbit antiserum as well as monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against M. meleagridis (MM) showed antigen heterogeneity among strains. Five anti-MM MAbs were selected for lack of reaction against heterologous avian mycoplasma. Three of these five Mabs did not cross-react with 63 mycoplasma strains from six species affecting turkeys other than M. meleagridis. The five Mabs used to analyse the epitopes of 30 M. meleagridis strains indicated that some epitopes were not expressed in all strains. Moreover, other epitopes were located on proteins which differed according to number or molecular mass from strain to strain. The five Mabs therefore, recognised variable surface proteins, among which two were amphiphilic membrane proteins. Three of the selected Mabs recognised 29 or 30 of the 30 tested strains. The in vitro expression of surface epitopes in M. meleagridis ATCC 25284 was investigated by colony immunobinding and allowed demonstration of a variable antigenic system...|$|E
40|$|A {{blocking}} {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (B-ELISA) {{was developed}} to detect antibodies to <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>meleagridis</b> (MM) in turkey sera. This assay was based on two mouse monoclonal antibodies recognising all MM strains tested but none of seven avian mycoplasmal species tested. Furthermore, their binding to the Tween 20 antigen was inhibited by serum from MM-infected birds. The B-ELISA test format was optimized. The cut-off was determined using a set of sera from MM-free turkeys. This B-ELISA was then compared with a commercial indirect ELISA (I-ELISA). Specificities of the two ELISA tests {{were not significantly different}} (100 or 99 %, respectively). The sensitivity of B-ELISA was significantly higher than the I-ELISA when I-ELISA suspicious results were considered as negative. Testing sera from experimentally MM-infected animals showed that serum plate agglutination (SPA) test detected positive birds before both ELISA methods. Samples were collected in MM-infected commercial flocks and analyzed by SPA, ELISAs, MM-PCR or culture. Results showed that the sensitivity of the B-ELISA appeared superior to the I-ELISA. Moreover, the ability to detect maternal antibodies makes it a useful tool for eradication or control of MM infections...|$|E

40|$|In March 1978, {{a number}} of turkeys with severe {{respiratory}} symptoms affecting over 80 % of the flock were investigated for a possible causative agent. With the standard techniques used for the isolation of bacteriae, mycoplasmae and viruses, only Mycoplasma gallisepticum, <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>meleagridis</b> and Newcastle disease virus were isolated. Tracheal organ cultures were subsequently prepared from 27 - day-old turkey embryos and inoculated with sinus exudate from affected turkeys. After an incubation period of 4 days a virus was isolated with which the typical symptoms, as observed in the field, could be reproduced in susceptible turkeys after 3 - 5 days. Following primary isolation in tracheal organ cultures, the virus grew readily in embryonated eggs and Vero cells. With the electron microscope, virus-like particles, varying in size from 40 nm- 500 nm, were observed, having a pleomorphic shape and studded with fine surface projections. The virus seems {{to fall into the}} family Paramyxoviridae. A vaccine produced from attenuated virus in embryonated eggs afforded good protection against mortalities due to airsacculitis that normally follows on to turkey rhinotracheitis infection.

40|$|<b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>meleagridis</b> (MM) is a {{major cause}} of disease and {{economic}} loss in turkeys. Formerly it was thought that this species was very host specific and only restricted to turkey. In this study, we report on the recovery of MM from breeding flocks of chickens located near a turkey breeding unit. Ten MM field strains were isolated (by culture on Frey broth medium) from tracheal swabs of chickens displaying clinical signs of mycoplasmosis-essentially respiratory symptoms and poor performance. Assignment of the isolated field strains to MM was confirmed by a growth inhibition assay using MM-specific polyclonal antiserum and by PCR amplification targeting the 16 S rRNA sequence as well as the Mm 14 sequence, a MM-species-specific DNA fragment previously identified and characterized in our laboratory. The nucleotide sequence of Mm 14 proved to be highly conserved among the 10 MM field strains, indicating a common source of infection. However, on the basis of slight differences in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis whole-cell proteins and western blot profiles, two groups of the isolated MM field strains could be distinguished. Evidence of MM infection of chickens was further provided by serology, since 13. 77 % (35 / 254) of sera proved positive to MM by either rapid serum agglutination or recombinant antigen-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, sera of all chickens from which MM was isolated were positive for antibodies to MM. Collectively, the data unambiguously show that MM could infect chickens; thus, MM warrants further exploration to determine its pathogenicity in this unusual host...|$|E
40|$|Two hundred turkey sera {{from eight}} Belgian and two French farms were {{tested for the}} {{presence}} of antibodies against avian pneumovirus (APV), Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT), Mycoplasma gallisepticum, <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>meleagridis</b> and Chlamydophila psittaci. At slaughter, C psittaci, APV and ORT antibodies were detected in 94, 34 and 6. 5 % of the turkeys, respectively. No antibodies against M. gallisepticum or M. meleagridis were present. Additionally, turkeys on three Belgian farms were examined from production onset until slaughter using both serology and antigen or gene detection. All farms experienced two C. psittaci infection waves, at 3 - 6 and 8 - 12 weeks of age. Each first infection wave was closely followed by an ORT infection starting at the age of 6 - 8 weeks, which was still detectable when the second C. psittaci infection waves started. Animals on farm A were not vaccinated against APV leading to an APV subtype B outbreak accompanying the first C. psittaci infection wave. Despite subtype A APV vaccination on farms B and C, the second C. psittaci infection waves were accompanied (farm B) or followed (farm Q by a subtype B APV infection. On all farms respiratory signs always appeared together with a proven C psittaci, APV and/or ORT infection. This study suggests an association between C. psittaci, APV and ORT, and indicates the multi-factorial aetiology of respiratory infections in commercial turkeys. All three pathogens should be considered when developing prevention strategies for respiratory disease. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe have {{previously}} identified species-specific DNA fragments, {{referred to as}} MS 2 / 28 and Mm 14, of Mycoplasma synoviae and <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>meleagridis,</b> respectively. In the present study, we extended our analysis of the MS 2 / 28 fragment that was found to encode a species-specific antigenic site, and we demonstrated the specificity of the Mycoplasma gallisepticum hemagglutinin protein encoded by pMGA 1. 2 (a member of the vlhA gene family). Then, we combined the Escherichia coli-expressed products of MS 2 / 28, Mm 14, and pMGA 1. 2, to develop a recombinant antigen-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (recELISA), for the simultaneous and specific detection of antibodies to the three aforementioned major avian mycoplasma species. For comparative purposes, a novel in-house crude antigen capture ELISA (capELISA) was developed in parallel. In the latter protocol, the microtiter wells were enriched in species-specific antigens by capturing sonicated crude antigens on coated rabbit polyclonal antibodies that had been extensively adsorbed with the whole antigen of the heterologous species. With regard to rapid serum agglutination, both ELISA tests were highly specific, and they showed a significant correlation when field sera from naturally infected birds were tested. recELISA proved to be highly specific because absorbance values, with the heterologous species, were significantly lower (P< 0. 001) than those obtained with capELISA. Given its cost-effectiveness and simplicity, the recombinant antigen-based ELISA seems to represent a valid tool for the specific screening {{of the three major}} avian mycoplasma species. recELISA will be particularly useful with regard to trade control because a large number of samples from various fields could be rapidly processed...|$|E
