40|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{a new type of}} settlements, {{commonly}} referred to as “reversed payment settlements” or simply “reverse settlements,” emerged in litigation over patents covering <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products.</b> What differentiates these new settlements from their traditional counterparts is that whereas traditionally, the alleged trespasser on someone else 2 ̆ 7 s rights pays the rights-holder to settle the litigation, in these new settlements it is the rights holder that pays the alleged trespasser. These settlements are a direct consequence of the various incentives provided by the Hatch-Waxman Act - an Act designed to increase competition between brand name and generic <b>manufactures</b> <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products.</b> In this Article, I propose a new approach and argue the proper way to police these agreements is not by subjecting them to an antitrust analysis, but by ordering a reexamination of any patent involved in a reverse settlement. The question of whether any reverse settlement is pro- or anti-competitive, turns on the strength of the patent and the likely conclusion of the litigation. The antitrust analysis is simply not designed to address the patent scope and validity issues, and therefore cannot properly differentiate between pro- and anti-competitive settlements. The patent law, on the other hand, is designed to evaluate the strength of the patent, and is therefore an obvious candidate to police reverse settlements. By employing the Patent Office 2 ̆ 7 s existing (but broadened) reexamination authority, weak patents can be invalidated and removed from the marketplace, thus opening up the market for new generic entrants. Additionally, if patentees know that their patents may be subject to reexamination, they will be less likely to enter into anti-competitive settlements. By expanding the scope of Patent Office 2 ̆ 7 s reexamination authority, and by assigning the task of evaluating the ultimate validity of questionable patents to the agency with expertise in patent law, the ability of parties to enter into beneficial and legitimate settlements, as well as consumer access to lower cost drugs and medical devices will both be preserved...|$|R

40|$|Phenylacetylcarbinol (PAC) is an {{important}} chiral molecule, the R-isomer of which {{is used in the}} <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> several <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products</b> and is currently produced by means of biotransformation. The knowledge of thermodynamic properties of PAC is essential to improve the process involving the separation of PAC from the organic solvent, used in the biotransformation process to extract PAC from the aqueous broth. In spite of its importance, limited experimental vapour pressure data is available on PAC in the literature. Hence, in this study, the physical and thermodynamic properties of PAC are predicted using structure property correlations combined with equations of state, and also molecular simulation as the first step to optimize the process design for the production of PAC. The properties predicted include liquid and vapour densities at co-existence, enthalpy of vaporization, saturation pressure, critical point and normal boiling point. The liquid and vapour densities at coexistence and the critical point data from both the methods are found to be in agreement. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

In this MA thesisa sterile chlorehexidine digluconate 0, 02 % and 0, 05 % solution, produced at the pharmacy of LSMU Kaunas clinics, was tested. Long-term and accelerated stability tests were carried out, but also solution {{under the influence of}} stress factors was examined. The amount of chlorhexidine was determined using the UV spectrophotometry method, on the other hand, the components in the mixture were identified using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The qualitative indexes of the chlorhexidine digluconate solutions were determined: appearance: colorless, odorless liquid, the value of the pH in interval 5, 5 – 7, 0, chlorhexidine digluconate amount in the solutions and the sterility tests was also performed. While performing long-term stability tests it was determined that after 3 months chlorhexidine digluconate solutions remain stable and sterile. After performing primary measurements, after 6 months, the lowered cholerhexidine amount was determined in the 1 series of the preparations, which was only 15. 92 after the initial quantity. In other series, there was no such change, so it was decided to perform the repeated test and to evaluate the result validity of the tests. The indexes of the solutions remain unchanged for the five months, while keeping it in 40 °C temperature and in 75 % of humidity. When chlorhexidine digluconate solutions were evaluated after the effect in the stressed factors, it was determined, that the molecule is resistance for the alcaline medium, 70 °C temperature and the day light. The chlorhexidine molecule split in 24 hours in the acidic environment, when pH was 2. 7 (p< 0, 05). According to the test results, the chlorhexidine digluconate solutions can be stored at room conditions, i. e. in the 25 °C temperature, the validity period is no longer than the 3 months...|$|E
40|$|In {{the food}} industry, a {{hygienic}} manufacturing environment {{is an absolute}} necessity {{in order to minimize}} reject rates due to contamination and ensure low-germ or sterile conditions. Product quality is especially impaired by microorganisms but also by other forms of contamination such as particles and chemical residues. Today, some foods are already produced and packaged under cleanroom conditions {{in the same way as}} practiced by the pharmaceutical industry. Cleanroom technology guarantees the necessary controlled conditions, fulfilling air quality requirements such as those stated in the EU-GMP Guideline Annex 1 for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> sterile <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products.</b> In order to minimize contamination risks during manufacturing processes, cleanroom environments need to be carefully planned to ensure that no sources of contamination will be present during later production. Flooring materials need to be taken especially into consideration. In general, known materials are implemented such as stoneware, epoxide and polyurethane systems, rubber flooring, PVC flooring and so-called Terrazzo systems are used. Current developments in the field of sheet materials and self-leveling resin-based industrial floorings have given them very good material properties and rendered them easy to lay neatly. There is a requirement to assess the suitability of the different floor coverings available for use in different hygienic areas. Comparative material tests supply the necessary basic information to identify appropriate systems and ensure that material properties fulfill regulation requirements. Using the qualification of industrial flooring as an example, the article describes an assessment and classification procedure which helps planners to make objective decisions about the choice of materials...|$|R
40|$|Separation and {{purification}} are {{an integral}} part and a major cost factor in the chemical industry. Distillation is a very commonly used for solvent separation and purification process. It is neither cost effective nor process efficient when dealing with close-boiling and azeotropic solvent mixtures without modifying the relative volatility of the solvent components with an extraneous solvent or a non-volatile solute electrolyte or nonelectrolyte. The selection of a suitable modifier generally depends on the experimental determination of its effect on the Vapour–Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) of the solvent mixture. Acetic acid is most widely used as aliphatic carbonic acid. It is frequently used as a solvent like in <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> cellulose acetate or in <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> many <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products.</b> Aqueous acetic acid is obtained during these processes and recovery of which is of great significance. Separation of pure water from dilute solution of Acetic acid –water mixture in the concentration range of 1 % to 30 % Acetic acid by simple rectification is almost impossible as relative volatility of the mixture in this range approaches unity. We would then require towers with large number of stages which would be operated with high reflux ratio and required high energy costs and operating costs. In practice extraction with suitable solvent is carried out before pure recovery occurs during the rectification of azeotropic mixture. An alternative separation process is the addition of Lithium Bromide(LiBr) salt into acetic-acid water solution. Lithium bromide is largely soluble in water. Addition of salt will increase the boiling point of salt-water solution, there by separating comparatively pure acetic acid as overhead product. LiBr–water solution remains as residue from which LiBr can be readily separated by evaporation and reused. Experiments are carried out in laboratory with different concentrations of Acetic acid-water, in Othmer still which is vapor-liquid equilibrium apparatus. An Extractive distillation column will be designed based on experimental results. Cost analysis of this new separation technique will be carried out. The experimental data will be correlated to any model to calculate activity coefficient...|$|R
40|$|Advances {{in biology}} have {{resulted}} in bioprocesses competing increasingly with chemical technologies for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> chemical and <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products.</b> Thus, chemical engineers have to assume new roles to design reactors with living cells which comprise intricate networks of enzyme catalyzed reactions. The cellular enzymes are themselves manipulated in response to environmental stimuli. This phenomenon, termed metabolic regulation, is {{a defining feature of}} biosystems as cells can not only change the extents of different reactions, but also decide which reactions to activate or exclude. The consequence of this versatility is extreme non-linearity with which engineering models must contend with for bioreactor optimization and control. Cellular environmental changes can cause variation in fluxes throughout the network and drastically affect the production of a desired secondary metabolite. Clearly, existing coarse models that rely on small sets of reactions, such as the uptake of selected substrates, to account for regulation cannot capture detailed pathways. This thesis, therefore, focuses on a much needed rational approach for large-scale metabolic modeling. The strategy presented builds on the cybernetic framework successful at predicting different substrate utilization patterns and expands it to address detailed pathway modeling. ^ The cybernetic framework perceives cells as optimal strategists which allocate limited cellular resources to groups of reactions. Objective functions are identified for elementary convergent, divergent, cyclic and linear pathways. This thesis projects a systematic algorithmic approach to identify elementary pathways in large networks The accompanying cybernetic competitions are identified using experimental flux measurements. The strategy has been applied to a hybridoma reactor problem of practical importance. Metabolic fluxes are used to construct a model which is successful in explaining the observed multiplicity of steady states with varying biomass, antibody and waste metabolite concentrations. The significant finding is that the cells seem to maximize substrate uptake leading to different metabolic states depending on the batch or fed-batch startup strategy employed. These metabolic states correspond to multiple steady states in continuous culture. Bifurcation analysis carried out on this and other cybernetic models suggests novel reactor start-up strategies beyond revealing interesting non-linear phenomena such as multiple steady states and periodic behavior. ...|$|R
