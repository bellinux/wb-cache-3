6000|$|... "No," [...] said Winston dryly, [...] "but one {{is apt to}} make an {{explanation}} too complete occasionally. Will you let <b>me</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> down?" ...|$|E

6000|$|You {{can do that}} as well if you're my wife.... You {{have before}} you a very {{difficult}} and trying time. Won't you let <b>me</b> <b>help</b> <b>you?</b> ...|$|E

6000|$|And come, now {{thou art}} going about this work, let <b>me</b> <b>help</b> <b>thee</b> in this matter. I. Ask thy heart, What evil dost thou see in sin? II. How sick art thou of sin? III.

6000|$|... "You {{seem to be}} {{very fond}} of flowers," [...] {{observed}} my companion. [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> gather them. To whom will you give your nosegay when it is made?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Restaurant critic Terry Durack {{explained}} {{that from a}} critic [...] "you hope for a thorough, objective and legitimate discussion" [...] that puts [...] "opera, art or book into context, so that it adds to your own body of knowledge"; {{in the context of}} a restaurant criticism, this means it is [...] "not about me liking it or not; it's about <b>me</b> <b>helping</b> <b>you</b> decide whether you are going to like it or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Sir," [...] he said. [...] "How can <b>you</b> expect <b>me</b> to <b>help</b> <b>you</b> to a drug so disastrous?--even if I {{could tell}} you what it is." ...|$|R
