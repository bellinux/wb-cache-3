5|$|In 2014, Indonesia {{has brought}} in a fishing and export ban as it has {{realized}} that <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> tourism is more economically beneficial than allowing the fish to be killed. A dead manta is worth $40 to $500 while <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> tourism can bring in $1 million during {{the life of a}} single <b>manta</b> <b>ray.</b> Indonesia has 5.8 million square kilometers (2.2 million square miles) of ocean and this is now the world's largest sanctuary for manta rays.|$|E
5|$|Ray tourism {{benefits}} {{locals and}} visitors by raising awareness of natural resource management and educating {{them about the}} animals. It can also provide funds for research and conservation. Constant unregulated interactions with tourists can negatively affect the fish by disrupting ecological relationships and increasing disease transmission. At Bora Bora, an excessive number of swimmers, boaters and jet skiers caused the local <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> population to abandon the area.|$|E

Some days no <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> are seen while on days with high plankton levels upwards of a dozen may be present. While diving, scuba divers shine lights up while snorkelers shine them down creating a column of light which attracts millions of minuscule plankton, which in turn attracts the <b>manta</b> <b>rays.</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceLarge {{tropical}} and sub-tropical marine animals {{must meet}} their energetic requirements in a largely oligotrophic environment. Many planktivorous elasmobranchs, whose thermal ecologies prevent foraging in nutrient-rich polar waters, aggregate seasonally at predictable locations throughout tropical oceans {{where they are}} observed feeding. Here we investigate the foraging and oceanographic environment around Lady Elliot Island, a known aggregation site for reef <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> <b>Manta</b> alfredi in the southern Great Barrier Reef. The foraging behaviour of reef <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> was analysed in relation to zooplankton populations and local oceanography, and compared to long-term sighting records of reef <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> from the dive operator on the island. Reef <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> fed at Lady Elliot Island when zooplankton biomass and abundance {{were significantly higher than}} other times. The critical prey density threshold that triggered feeding was 11. 2 mg m(- 3) while zooplankton size had no significant effect on feeding. The community composition and size structure of the zooplankton was similar when reef <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> were feeding or not, with only the density of zooplankton changing. Higher zooplankton biomass was observed prior to low tide, and long-term (similar to 5 years) sighting data confirmed that more reef <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> are also observed feeding during this tidal phase than other times. This is the first study to examine prey availability at an aggregation site for reef <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> and it indicates that they feed in locations and at times of higher zooplankton biomass...|$|R

25|$|The Formigas Bank is {{essentially}} a submarine volcano, inhabited by deep-dwelling marine species, coral and sponges. The cone is delimited approximately by the islets of the northwest and the Dollabarats reef to the southeast. In the ancient crater there is a rich community of species common to the Azores. Among the species typical of the area are wrasse (Mediterranean rainbow wrasse, ornate wrasse), damselfish, sergeant fish (yellow and black), grouper, Mediterranean parrotfish, and the emblematic Atlantic goliath grouper, Serranidae and barred hogfish. Alongside these are pelagic predators that also reside in the bank (African threadfish, longbill spearfish) and migratory species that travel between destinations (like the <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> and whale shark).|$|E

40|$|<b>Manta</b> <b>rays</b> (<b>Manta</b> spp.) are plankton-feeding {{elasmobranchs}} {{classified as}} vulnerable to extinction on the IUCN Red List for Threatened Species. Despite increasing public and scientific interest in <b>manta</b> <b>rays,</b> major knowledge gaps concerning their movement ecology and dispersal capabilities remain. Here, we used pop-off satellite-linked archival transmitting tags {{to examine the}} horizontal movements and habitat use patterns of reef <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> (M. alfredi) departing Lady Elliot Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Tagged individuals moved across a latitudinal range of 1035 km, travelling up to 2441 km in 118 d, diving down to 294. 5 m and venturing up to 155 km off the continental shelf. Using random walk simulations, we showed that <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> spent significantly more time in an offshore region characterised by the mesoscale cyclonic Capricorn Eddy than would be expected by chance. A behaviour-switching state-space model suggested this area {{to be an important}} foraging ground for M. alfredi off eastern Australia. We document the movements of 1 individual using offshore waters between 2 known aggregation regions off eastern Australia. Reef <b>manta</b> <b>rays</b> thus not only occupy inshore continental shelf and shelf-edge waters but also use offshore environments to exploit productive hotspots and travel long distances. Our findings highlight the need to better understand their movement ecology for effective management. 14 page(s...|$|R

25|$|As the Klingons {{are portrayed}} as a warrior culture, Klingon starships are usually {{depicted}} as warships, heavily armed {{with a variety of}} particle beam weaponry and antimatter warheads. Many Klingon ships also make use of cloaking technology to hide the vessel from view. The first Klingon ship design used in The Original Series, the D7-class battlecruiser, was designed by Matt Jefferies to evoke a predator's shape akin to that of a <b>manta</b> <b>ray,</b> providing a threatening and instantly recognizable form for viewers. The configuration of Jefferies' design featured a bulbous forward hull connected by a long boom to a wing-like main hull with the engine nacelles mounted on each wingtip. Later Klingon starships by other designers kept to this same overall configuration, although updated to reflect their respective time periods: Rick Sternbach's designs for The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine drew on elements of Starfleet ships features to reflect the alliance between the Federation and the Klingons, while John Eaves' designs for Enterprise incorporated more rugged and primitive construction to make the vessels appear consistent with the earlier time period.|$|E
25|$|A common predatory {{technique}} {{that has been}} observed among benthic elasmobranchs is ambushing behavior. As it pertains to rays, skates, carpet sharks, and angel sharks, the predator searches for suitable hiding environments such as sand, pebbles, coral, or algae that match its coloration or patterning, which {{is also known as}} aggressive mimicry. Ambushing is a behavior in which a predator relies on its coloring, body structure, or the environment as an advantage in concealing itself while waiting on unsuspecting prey to enter its striking range. There have been recorded occasions where this form of ambushing behavior of stingrays and related benthic sharks has been directed towards a common prey type. One example of this occasion involves the chokka squid, (Loligo vulgaris reynaudii), which spawns in the inshore coastal habitats around South Africa. The diamond ray (Gymnura natalensis) frequently relies on aggressive mimicry as it blends into sandy habitats waiting for preoccupied female chokka squids who are busy spawning. Diamond rays then shoot off from the bottom substrates and use suction feeding to ingest the spawning squids and their eggs. Suction feeding works in conjunction and is aided by ram filter feeding, which is demonstrated by pelagic rays including the <b>manta</b> <b>ray</b> (Manta birostris) and the closely related devil rays (Mobula sp.). Many of the pelagic rays have external mouth structures called cephalic lobes that assist in siphoning in water and planktonic organisms as the rays swim in acrobatic patterns in these patches of food. A stingray's diet includes small fish, snails, clams, and shrimp, and some other small sea creatures.|$|E
