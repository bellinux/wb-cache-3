25|$|According to the 2002 Metro Manila Solid Waste Management Report of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Valenzuela has {{the highest}} number of {{identified}} recycling companies in the region. It was also said that recycling centers related to plastic materials are relatively higher than other recyclable objects like metals, paper, glass among others. Accordingly, the city government allocates an amount of about 785.70 Philippine pesos (approx. US$18 as of April 2011) for every transportation and collection costs of a ton of waste material. In 2003, the city generated about 307.70 tons of waste every day. In 2001, it was reported by ADB that the city has as high as 25% solid waste management cost recovery rate through service charges on households and other enterprises for operational activities associated with waste collection, treatment and disposal. That same year, the city's proposal to implement a community-based solid waste management project in barangay Mapulang Lupa, was approved by the national government, which involves social mobilization, training of personnel, implementation of segregated collection and establishment of <b>materials</b> <b>recovery</b> facility and windows composting operation among others.

40|$|In this thesis, a {{methodology}} for incorporating disassemblability into life-cycle design for <b>Material</b> <b>Recovery</b> Opportunities (MRO) is presented. Disassemblability {{is defined as}} the ability to optimize the design and disassembly process for removal of specific parts or materials in a manner which will simultaneously minimize costs and maximize the material value to be reclaimed. MRO are defined as an opportunity to reclaim post-consumer products for recycling, remanufacturing and re-use. This methodology has been developed to identify and assess cost-effective characteristics of disassembly for the recovery of products. Four levels of analysis are introduced: (1) economic analysis, (2) optimal disassembly sequence generation, (3) disassembly optimization, and (4) design for disassembly. Three economic indices are presented to evaluate the trade-off between reclamation and disposal of individual components using a disassembly tree. A systematic procedure for generating an optimal disassembly sequence based on maximizing the economics of <b>material</b> <b>recovery</b> is presented. Five criteria are established to reduce the search space and facilitate <b>material</b> <b>recovery</b> opportunities: (1) <b>material</b> compatibility, (2) clustering for disposal, (3) concurrent disassembly operations, (4) maximizing yield, and (5) clustering for maximum reclamation value. Employing disassemblability into life-cycle design will reduce environmental impacts over the life-cycle and facilitate economic <b>material</b> <b>recovery.</b> The methodology has been tested and developed by collaborating with Laidlaw 2 ̆ 7 s Disassembly Plant in Hamilton, Ontario.
