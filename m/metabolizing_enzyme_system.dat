40|$|Abstract Partial {{hepatectomy}} {{has been}} suggested to affect hepatic and renal cytochrome P 450 content and the related drug <b>metabolizing</b> <b>enzyme</b> <b>system.</b> In addition, cytochrome P 450 and its dependent activities {{have been shown to}} be regulated by the availability of cellular heme. We, therefore, studied cytochrome P 450 in addition to the level of heme oxygenase, the rate-limiting enzyme of heme catabolism, and delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme of heme synthesis, in the remnant liver and intact kidneys of rats after two-thirds hepatectomy. The level of hepatic heme oxygenase was elevated threefold in partially hepatectomized rats as compared to sham-operated rats, while ALA synthase was decreased by 40 %. This was reflected in decreased hepatic cytochrome P 450 content, ie, from 0. 689 +/- 0. 175 nmole/mg to 0. 505 +/- 0. 089 nmole/mg protein and associated decreased drug metabolizing enzymes: aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase, 7 -ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase, and benzphetamine N-demethylase, by 40 %, 40 %, and 47 %, respectively. In contrast, renal heme oxygenase was not changed after hepatectomy, whereas renal ALA synthase was increased by fourfold. Renal cytochrome P 450, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase, 7 -ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase, and benzphetamine N-demethylase were increased after partial hepatectomy by 84 %, 360 %, 165 % and 406 %, respectively. These data indicate that partial hepatectomy decreases liver cytochrome P 450 levels by inducing heme oxygenase and inhibiting ALA synthase activities. In this situation the kidney plays a substitutive role in metabolizing endogenous substrates oxygenated by cytochrome P 450 isozymes...|$|E

There is increasing recent evidence that the drug <b>metabolizing</b> <b>enzyme</b> <b>system</b> associated {{to a number of}} membrane transport proteins is of particular relevance in relation to cardiovascular diseases, either in biosynthetic or degradative pathways. The overall aim {{of the present study was}} to characterize selected genes coding for drug metabolizing enzymes and influx and efflux transporters both from the point of view of pharmacogenetic diversity and from their response to increased cholesterol concentrations. Specifically we a) characterized, in a sample of the Portuguese population, selected genetic polymorphisms in cytochromes P 450, influx and efflux transporters that are known to – or may be expected to - affect in vitro or in vivo the metabolism or transport of cholesterol and/or therapeutic drugs; b) evaluated the existence of ethnic variability in the frequency of these polymorphic variants, through the determination of their prevalence in other populations; and c) investigated to which extent the expression of these genes, in liver and intestine derived cells, may be influenced by the accumulation of cholesterol. Most of the polymorphisms analysed present a similar distribution between Portuguese and Colombian populations, but significant differences when compared with the Mozambican population, demonstrating that these polymorphisms are ethnicity-dependent. The expression profiling studies revealed a differential expression pattern for the analysed genes in cell culture models from liver and intestine and a differential response to cholesterol, pointing to significant differences in gene regulation in these tissues. Taken together, the results obtained in this study contribute to a better knowledge of drug metabolism and transport in hypercholesterolemia as well as to understanding the pharmacogenetic variability of the genes involved in these pathways...|$|E

Pharmacogenetic variability associated with the drug <b>metabolizing</b> <b>enzyme</b> <b>systems</b> is a major determinant of variations in these outcomes. Materials and Methods: A case-control study of 100 male cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and equal number of healthy controls was conducted. Genomic DNA isolated from blood samples collected from controls and patients was studied by PCR-RFLP technique for CYP 2 D 6 polymorphism. All patients received three cycles of cisplatinum-based sequential chemoradiotherapy. Results: The increased frequency of variant genotypes was associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk in the cases both in CYP 2 D 6 FNx 014 and FNx 0110. The effect of interaction of the risk modifiers such as cigarette smoking or tobacco chewing or alcohol drinking with the CYP 2 D 6 genotypes in the controls and patients was found to be significant.

However, the dietary intake of fruits and vegetables, as well as antioxidant micronutrients, is decreased in smokers 4.

Levels of glutathione, glutathlone S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase were analyzed in melanoma and nonmelanoma cell lines. In addition, 18 melanoma metastases derived from skin and lymph nodes were examined. Levels of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase were statistically different in cells derived from melanocytic tumors compared with non-melanoma cell lines and normal cells. In addition, GST levels in metastases derived from skin or lymph nodes were significantly lower than those in permanent cell lines. However, levels of glutathione and related enzymes in metastases and cell lines fluctuated over a wide range, up to 40 -fold, regardless of treatment status or origin of metastases. In a second part of the study, the expression of GST isoenzymes a, μ, and μ was studied by immunohistology in 10 benign nevi, 29 primary melanomas, and 39 melanoma metastases before and during chemotherapy.

40|$|We {{have used}} a model of dietary {{deficiency}} {{that leads to a}} chronic oxidative stress to evaluate responses invoked to boost antioxidant cellular defense systems. The present studies demonstrates that there is adaptive response mechanisms invoked in the absence of vitamin E. The central component of this adaptive mechanism is coenzyme Q and its recycling factors. In our first study, Long Evans hooded weaning rats were fed a diet without vitamin E and Se for six weeks, leading the animals to be deficient in both nutrients (−E −Se). Deficiency was accompanied by a two-fold increase in redox activities associated with transplasma membrane electron transport, an increase in ascorbate and glutathione was found in the liver tissue, increased microsomal, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and an increase of cytosolic Ca 2 +-independent phospholipase A 2. Liver plasma membranes isolated from these rats were more sensitive to lipid peroxidation, although they contained 40 % greater amounts of ubiquinone than the plasma membranes from rats consuming control diets (+E +Se). The incubation of plasma membranes with NAD(P) H resulted in protection against peroxidation, and this effect was more pronounced in −E −Se membranes. In our second study, Long Evans hooded rats were fed a diet without vitamin E. The oxidative stress induced here led to invocation of a sequence of antioxidant defense mechanisms in the liver of vitamin E-deficient animals. This single nutrient deficiency allowed us to characterize a three-phase adaptive response to oxidative stress induced by vitamin E deficiency. Phase one occurred when tocopherol was depleted from membranes and involved increased concentrations and capacity of primary antioxidants, ascorbate and ubiquinol and their recycling enzymatic machinery. The early changes appear to be sufficient to preserve the balance between ROS and defense mechanisms as the rats continued to grow as well as the control during this time period.

Phase three was characterized by accumulating concentrations of the product of oxidative stress damage along with the induction of lipid <b>metabolizing</b> <b>enzyme</b> <b>systems.</b> ...|$|R

Herbal products sold to the public are often not a single chemical compound, but rather a complex mixture of hundreds of different constituents. Human microsomal systems have been employed as a cost and time efficient approach to prospectively evaluate individual constituents for the potential for interactions with drug <b>metabolizing</b> <b>enzymes.</b> In fact, {{it has been shown that}} certain herbal constituents are capable of direct inhibition of drug <b>metabolizing</b> <b>enzymes</b> in this <b>system.</b> However, extrapolation of the drug interaction potential to cellular systems or whole organisms is often difficult because the preparation of microsomes necessitates the destruction of the integrity of the living cell and the physiologically relevant processes within. The primary goal of this dissertation research was to investigate the effect of herbal products on human hepatic drug <b>metabolizing</b> <b>enzymes</b> and transporters using primary cultures of human hepatocytes. Cultured hepatocytes were exposed to the various herbal constituents acutely, to evaluate the direct effect on enzyme activity, or chronically, to evaluate the indirect effect on enzyme expression and subsequent activity. Additionally, in order to assess to scalability of our in vitro UGT 1 A results to humans, healthy human subjects were administered acetaminophen, a general UGT 1 A probe, before and after a 7 -day course of milk thistle. These data demonstrate that herbal constituents can directly inhibit enzyme activity but also influence activity by indirectly modulating gene expression. In the case of St. John's wort, human hepatocytes showed that while constituents were capable of enzyme induction, inhibition also occurred. However, in vivo, it is the former that predominates over the latter. Furthermore, our predictions of interactions in vivo for St. John's wort have been validated through a number of clinical studies. The case of milk thistle, however, proved more complex.

40|$|Chronic {{administration}} of ethanol to rats {{has no effect}} on the plasma half life of pentobarbitone, which indicates that ethanol does not induce the microsomal <b>enzyme</b> <b>system</b> and that the latter is therefore not identical with the 'microsomal ethanol oxidizing system'. The microsomal oxidation of ethanol observed in vitro is probably the result of metabolism of ethanol by contaminating alcohol dehydrogenase and by catalase peroxidation. Chronic {{administration of}} ethanol to rats leads to stimulation of the activity of the hepatic drug <b>metabolizing</b> <b>enzymes</b> in vitro which is not paralleled by any corresponding increase in the concentration of cytochrome P- 450, the terminal enzyme in the microsomal mono oxygenase system. However, no changes were seen in hexobarbital sleeping time or zoxazolamine paralysis time, confirming that ethanol pretreatment does not lead to any significant stimulation of the hepatic microsomal drug <b>metabolizing</b> <b>enzymes</b> in vivo. The observed inhibition of barbiturate metabolism after simultaneous administration of large amounts of ethanol may be attributed to nonspecific interaction with the active site of the microsomal drug <b>metabolizing</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Ethanol has also been shown to potentiate the enzyme induction effect of phenobarbitone in vitro in respect of cytochrome P- 450 and cytochrome b 5. The effect was even more pronounced in vivo when none of the animals pretreated with both phenobarbitone and ethanol exhibited zoxazolamine paralysis and only one third of these animals exhibited narcosis after hexobarbitone administration. The lipophilic character of ethanol allows it to penetrate the lipid environment of the endoplasmic reticulum and to interact with cytochrome P- 450 giving a type II substrate interaction spectrum, although it is not metabolized by the microsomal mono oxygenase system. The molar concentration of ethanol required to give a type II spectrum is much higher than that required for aniline suggesting that the interaction of ethanol with cytochrome P- 450 is a non specific interaction with the lipophilic phase of the microsomal membrane adjacent to the haemoprotein. Ethanol may therefore act as an activator of the microsomal mono oxygenase <b>enzyme</b> <b>system</b> either by modification of the membrane environment, by allosteric effects, or by displacement of other endogenous or exogenous substrates already bound to the enzymic sites.

40|$|Pathophysiological {{changes in}} human {{patients}} and in animal models of infection or inflammation {{are associated with}} alterations {{in the production of}} numerous liver-derived proteins including <b>metabolizing</b> <b>enzymes.</b> In this study, the effects of adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) in rats on the levels of mRNA and activity of hepatic xenobiotic <b>metabolizing</b> <b>enzymes</b> were determined during the inflammatory response. The mRNA levels of cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 1 A 2, CYP 2 C 12, CYP 2 D 1, CYP 2 D 2, and CYP 3 A 1 were significantly decreased compared with control levels in almost all phases of inflammation. A reduction in the activity of CYP 2 C and CYP 3 A, which are abundantly expressed in the liver, was also observed. For phase II <b>metabolizing</b> <b>enzymes,</b> mRNA levels of uridine 5 ’-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1 A 1, UGT 1 A 6, sulfotransferase (SULT) 2 A 1, and glutathione S-transferase 2 were significantly decreased compared with control levels. However, the mRNA levels of UGT 2 B and SULT 1 A 1 returned to control levels during the subacute (7 d after adjuvant treatment) and chronic (21 d after adjuvant treatment) phases although these levels decreased during the acute (3 d after adjuvant treatment) phase. These results suggest that the effects of inflammation on the expression of xenobiotic <b>metabolizing</b> <b>enzymes</b> differ depending on the isoform of the enzyme and could affect the pharmacokinetics of each substrate. </span...|$|R

Personalized medicine is particularly important in oncology, whereby most clinically used anticancer drugs have a narrow therapeutic window and exhibit a large interindividual pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability. This variability can be explained, at least in part, by genetic variations in the genes encoding drug <b>metabolizing</b> <b>enzymes,</b> transporters, or drug targets. Understanding of how genetic variations influence drug disposition and action could help in tailoring cancer therapy based on individual&rsquo;s genetic makeup. This review focuses on the pharmacogenomics of drug <b>metabolizing</b> <b>enzymes</b> and drug transporters, with a particular highlight of examples whereby genetic variations in the <b>metabolizing</b> <b>enzymes</b> and transporters influence the pharmacokinetics and/or response of chemotherapeutic agents. Keywords: polymorphisms, personalized medicine, oncology, enzymes, transporters, dru...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCigarette {{smoking is}} the {{predominant}} {{risk factor for}} bladder cancer in males and females. The tobacco carcinogens are metabolized by various xenobiotic <b>metabolizing</b> <b>enzymes</b> such as N-acetyltransferases (NAT) and glutathione S-transferases (GST). Polymorphisms in NAT and GST genes alter the ability of these <b>enzymes</b> to <b>metabolize</b> carcinogens. In this paper, we conduct a statistical analysis based on logistic regressions {{to assess the impact}} of smoking and <b>metabolizing</b> <b>enzyme</b> genotypes on the risk to develop bladder cancer using a case-control study from Tunisia. We also use the generalized ordered logistic model to investigate whether these factors do have an impact on the progression of bladder tumors...|$|R
