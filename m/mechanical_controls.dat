2500|$|A {{variety of}} {{treatments}} are currently marketed or practiced {{to attempt to}} control these mites. [...] The treatments are generally segregated into chemical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Common <b>mechanical</b> <b>controls</b> {{generally}} rely on {{disruption of}} {{some aspect of}} the mites' lifecycle. [...] These controls are generally intended not to eliminate all mites, but merely to maintain the infestation at a level which the colony can tolerate. [...] Examples of <b>mechanical</b> <b>controls</b> include drone brood sacrifice (varroa mites are preferentially attracted to the drone brood), powdered sugar dusting (which encourages cleaning behavior and dislodges some mites), screened bottom boards (so any dislodged mites fall through the bottom and away from the colony), brood interruption and, perhaps, downsizing of the brood cell size. A device called the varroa mite control entrance (VMCE) is under development as of 2008. The VMCE works in conjunction with a screened bottom board, by dislodging varroa mites from bees as they enter and exit a hive.|$|E

2500|$|A key step in {{managing}} weeds in any pasture system is identification. [...] Once the undesired species in a pasture system are identified, an integrated approach of management {{can be implemented}} to control weed populations. [...] It {{is important to recognize}} that no single approach to weed management will result in weed free pastures; therefore, various cultural, mechanical, and chemical control methods can be combined in an integrated weed management plan. [...] Cultural controls include: avoiding spreading manure contaminated with weed seeds, cleaning equipment after working in weed infested areas, and managing weed problems in fencerows and other areas near pastures. [...] <b>Mechanical</b> <b>controls</b> such as repeated mowing, clipping, and hand weeding can also be used to effectively manage weed infestations by weakening the plant. [...] These methods should be implemented when weed flower buds are closed or just starting to open to prevent seed production. [...] Although these methods for managing weeds greatly reduces reliance on herbicides, weed problems may still persist in managed grazing systems and the use of herbicides may become necessary. [...] Use of herbicides may restrict the use of a pasture for some length of time, depending on the type and amount of the chemical used. [...] Frequently, weeds in pasture systems are patchy and therefore spot treatment of herbicides may be used as a least cost method of chemical control.|$|E
