40|$|The EU {{landfill}} directive {{has imposed}} a challenging set of {{targets for the}} UK {{to reduce the amount}} of waste sent to landfill. This has resulted in an increased realisation that wastes can be recycled and reprocessed into valuable products. One such area that is undergoing significant development is the composting of biodegradable waste products. The primary or secondary treatment of wastes by earthworms (vermicomposting) has been proposed as a mechanism to enhance the commercial value of composts. The commercialization of these technologies, however, requires the development of stable markets and consumer confidence in the end products. Currently, in the scientific literature, there are several reports that vermicomposts enhance plant growth; however the mechanism for this enhancement is poorly understood. The first experimental chapter of this thesis presents data from an experiment into the in-vessel co-composting of Green Wastes (GW), Green waste with Paper Pulp (GW/PP), and Green waste with Biosolids (GW/SS) using Ecopod® composting process. It aimed to determine whether compost chemistry and end-use was affected by feedstock quality. Consequently, three feedstock were made by mixing green waste with paper pulp or biosolids (paper I). Vermicomposts were subsequently produced from the three Ecopod® composts. In three separate plant growth trials the presence of vermicompost significantly affected plant growth. However, not all plant species responded in the positive manner previously reported (paper II). In cereal growth, substituting inorganic fertiliser with vermicompost did not decrease yield as long as some inorganic fertiliser was present in the feeding regime. This is true for wheat and <b>maize</b> (<b>paper</b> III, appendix 2). Similarly silage grass responded much better to applications of vermicompost than to conventional composts applied at the same rate (appendix 2). Tomatoes grown in commercial growth media substituted with vermicompost did not respond in the same way as reported in previous studies; no significant yield increases were observed. Few studies report on the effect of growing medium/ fertilising regime on vitamin content of foods. With increasing interest in organic food production systems in particular, it is becoming increasingly important that we understand the effects that growing conditions have on the nutritional properties of foods. In this case there was no effect of growing medium on ascorbic acid (vitamin C) content of tomatoes (paper IV). The final chapter (paper V) was a collaborative work with A. P. Williams and investigates the effect of earthworm digestion on the survival and proliferation of E. coli 0157 in composts and soil. Litter dwelling earthworms (e. g. Dendrobaena veneta) significantly aided the lateral movement of E. coli 0157 within compost. Our results imply that whilst long-term persistence of E. coli 0157 in soil and compost may be unaffected by the presence of earthworms, digestion from worms may aid proliferation of the pathogen during initial stages of soil or compost contamination. In summary, this thesis shows that feedstock can be used to manipulate compost product quality. After vermicomposting the plant growth response is often species specific. Our failure to replicate US studies suggests that vermicompost production methods and process management may also affect end product quality. This will hinder commercialisation of the technology. Significant further work is required to identify the method by which plant growth enhancement is facilitated by vermicomposts and to what extent this is specific to a particular vermicompost production method. i...|$|E

40|$|AEE Working <b>Paper.</b> <b>Maize</b> {{prices have}} been {{established}} by central government in most {{countries in the region}} since the 1930 s. Maize is the most important staple crop and adequate supplies are essential to food security. The major concern in the region is with the instability of food supplies rather than increased supplies since the agronomic potential exists for adequate or surplus maize production in normal rain-fall years. This paper shows how the pricing system has exaggerated the inherently variable maize supplies. While a general trend towards providing more attractive farm prices for maize is apparent in East and Southern Africa, this is linked to policies which emphasize maize self-sufficiency rather than comparative advantage in agricultural production. Most countries in Eastern and Southern Africa have adopted a policy of self-sufficiency in maize. Virtually all the maize grown is rain fed.

Specifically, the time for the waxy maize starch-based films to be dissolved in water was reduced from 150 to 10 [*]s.

Besides, the elongation at break of the films was increased from 15 to 46 %, apparently due to the plasticization effect of the prebiotics. Moreover, the in vitro microorganism results indicated that the prebiotic activity of the functional films would not be affected by the film preparation (solution casting) process.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{factors related}} to the supply of hybrid maize seed in Ghana and lays the groundwork for research on the demand side. There {{are a number of}} public maize hybrids, but most are recently released and only a few are readily available to farmers. There has also been importation of hybrid maize seed, but this is now severely restricted. The current system for variety release is undergoing modification and has proven particularly unsatisfactory for imported hybrids. One of the major challenges in promoting the public hybrids has been an inef-ficient source seed system, and this has affected the prospects of the relatively few emerging domestic seed companies that are attempting to produce and market local hybrids. There are also serious deficiencies in mar-keting local hybrids. Problems in local hybrid production and marketing and small quantities of imported seed mean that only a small minority of farmers have experience with <b>maize</b> hybrids. The <b>paper</b> also looks at the regu-latory and policy issues affecting hybrid maize promotion and examines the interplay between the substantial portfolio of donor projects supporting the seed sector and government stances and priorities.

40|$|Background and Aims: Prediction of {{phenotypic}} traits {{from new}} genotypes under untested environmental conditions {{is crucial to}} build simulations of breeding strategies to improve target traits. Although the plant response to environmental stresses is characterized by both architectural and functional plasticity, recent attempts to integrate biological knowledge into genetics models have mainly concerned specific physiological processes or crop models without architecture, and thus may prove limited when studying genotype x environment interactions. Consequently, this paper presents a simulation study introducing genetics into a functional-structural growth model, which gives access to more fundamental traits for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection and thus to promising tools for yield optimization. Methods: The GreenLab model was selected as a reasonable choice to link growth model parameters to QTL. Virtual genes and virtual chromosomes were defined to build a simple genetic model that drove the settings of the species-specific parameters of the model. The QTL Cartographer software was used to study QTL detection of simulated plant traits. A genetic algorithm was implemented to define the ideotype for yield maximization based on the model parameters and the associated allelic combination. Key Results and Conclusions: By keeping the environmental factors constant and using a virtual population {{with a large number}} of individuals generated by a Mendelian genetic model, results for an ideal case could be simulated. Virtual QTL detection was compared in the case of phenotypic traits - such as cob weight - and when traits were model parameters, and was found to be more accurate in the latter case. The practical interest of this approach is illustrated by calculating the parameters (and the corresponding genotype) associated with yield optimization of a GreenLab <b>maize</b> model. The <b>paper</b> discusses the potentials of GreenLab to represent environment x genotype interactions, in particular through its main state variable, the ratio of biomass supply over demand...|$|R
