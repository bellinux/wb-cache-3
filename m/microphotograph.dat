5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York, Häyhänen {{spent the next}} two years establishing his identity. During that time he received money from his superiors left in dead-letter boxes in the Bronx and Manhattan. It is known he occasionally drew attention to himself by indulging in heavy drinking sessions and heated arguments with his Finnish wife Hannah. For six months Häyhänen checked the thumbtack and no one had made contact. He also checked a dead-drop location he had memorized. There he found a hollowed-out nickel. However, prior to opening the coin Häyhänen had misplaced it, either buying a newspaper with it or using it as a subway token. For the next seven months the hollow nickel travelled around the New York City economy, unopened. The trail of the hollow nickel ended when a thirteen-year-old newsboy was collecting for his weekly deliveries. The newsboy accidentally dropped the nickel and it broke in half, revealing a <b>microphotograph</b> containing a series of numbers. The newsboy handed the nickel to a New York detective, who in turn forwarded it to the FBI. From 1953 to 1957, though every effort was made to decipher the <b>microphotograph,</b> the FBI was unable to solve the mystery.|$|E

Roeder and Sebold met {{in public places}} and proceeded to spots where they could talk privately.

As a German agent her mission was to find her targets at New York nightclubs, sleep with these men, and attempt to {{blackmail}} them or otherwise entice them to give up valuable secrets. One FBI agent described her as a “good-looking nymphomaniac”. Stein {{was one of the people}} to whom Sebold had been instructed to deliver <b>microphotograph</b> instructions upon his arrival in the United States. She frequently met with Sebold to give him information for transmittal to Germany, and her address was used as a return address by other agents in mailing data for Germany.|$|E

40|$|A {{correlative}} {{study of}} neuronal reconstruction methods was made using both conventional (non-confocal) and real-time confocal microscopies. Simple and sophisticated (totally automated) methods are described for making both biplanar <b>microphotographs</b> using conventional transmitted light, and stereoscopic <b>microphotographs</b> using real-time confocal microscopy of Golgi-impregnated neurons. Confocal microscopy discriminates against out-of-focus layers to produce optical sections {{which can be}} summed on photographic film to obtain neuronal reconstructions. Biplanes images are obtained by fusion, using a stereo-viewer, of two adjacent optical sections obtained with a conventional transmitted light microscope. Stereoscopic and biplanar <b>microphotographs</b> of 3 -day-old chick neurons are presented. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
25|$|Sebold {{reported}} to Hamburg, {{where he was}} instructed {{in such areas as}} preparing coded messages and <b>microphotographs.</b> On completion of training, he was given five <b>microphotographs</b> containing instructions for preparing a code and detailing the type of information he was to transmit to Germany from the United States. Sebold was told to retain two of the <b>microphotographs</b> and to deliver the other three to German operatives in the United States: Fritz Joubert Duquesne, Hermann Lang, and one other. After receiving final instructions, including using the assumed name Harry Sawyer, he sailed from Genoa, Italy, and arrived in New York City on February 8, 1940.|$|R

5000|$|Using the {{daguerreotype}} process, John Benjamin Dancer {{was one of}} {{the first}} to produce <b>microphotographs,</b> in 1839.He achieved a reduction ratio of 160:1. Dancer perfected his reduction procedures with Frederick Scott Archer’s wet collodion process, developed in 1850-51, but he dismissed his decades-long work on <b>microphotographs</b> as a personal hobby, and did not document his procedures. The idea that microphotography could be no more than a novelty was an opinion shared by the 1858 Dictionary of Photography, which called the process [...] "somewhat trifling and childish." ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{concerns}} to examination of deformation distribution {{along the wall}} of a tube-like article at conditions of the two-dimensional local state of strain for plastic burnishing. According to the adopted point of view the local deformation concentrates mainly in a plastic fold (wave) of metal to move before the frontal face of the burnishing mandrel. The case when lack of the fold, i. e., the two-dimensional state of strain, is observed in the paper. The local deformation is determined by computing elongation of a mass of metal structure grains from <b>microphotographs</b> before and after different rates of strain. The <b>microphotographs</b> are shot at several points along the wall thickness and they are applied in the paper...|$|R

5000|$|Stanhopes or Stanho-scopes are optical {{devices that}} enable the viewing of microphotographs without using a microscope. They were invented by René Dagron in 1857. Dagron {{bypassed}} {{the need for}} an expensive microscope to view the microscopic photographs by attaching the <b>microphotograph</b> {{at the end of a}} modified Stanhope lens. He called the devices bijoux photo-microscopiques or microscopic photo-jewelry. In 1862, Dagron displayed the devices at the Exhibition in London, where he got an [...] "Honourable Mention" [...] and presented them to Queen Victoria. [...] In 1864 Dagron became famous when he produced a stanhope optical viewer which enabled the viewing of a <b>microphotograph</b> 1 mm2, (equivalent in size to the head of a pin), that included the portraits of 450 people.|$|E
