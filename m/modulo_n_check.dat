The {{remainders}} in the period, which are 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, form a rearrangement of all nonzero remainders modulo 7, implying that 3 is indeed a primitive root modulo 7. This derives from the fact that a sequence (gk <b>modulo</b> <b>n)</b> always repeats after some value of k, since <b>modulo</b> <b>n</b> produces a finite number of values.
