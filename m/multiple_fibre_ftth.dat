40|$|This chapter covers {{techniques}} for resolving <b>multiple</b> <b>fibre</b> populations in each voxel, {{as well as}} methods to exploit the information they recover. It begins by describing the limitations of DTI and the problems that complex white-matterconfigurations such as crossing fibre-populations and bending fibres present. It {{then goes on to}} describe multiple-tensor models, diffusion spectrum imaging, QBall, spherical deconvolution and persistent angular structure (PAS) MRI, along with a summary of pros and cons of each method. The next section covers useful informationthat can be extracted from the output of the techniques presented, suchasestimates of fibre-orientations and indices of anisotropy and complexity.

50|$|On 7 October 2009, the Swiss Federal Office of Communications (ComCom) has {{revealed}} that round table discussions on the deployment of fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) networks are producing concrete results. According to the regulator the major players are now in agreement on uniform technical standards, meaning {{that there are no}} technical barriers to the rapid expansion of the fibre network. A consensus has also been reached on coordination, which will prevent the parallel construction of new networks by laying <b>multiple</b> <b>fibres</b> in every building (known as the <b>multiple</b> <b>fibre</b> model). At the same time the participants at the round table have agreed that all providers must have access to the fibre-optic network under the same conditions, so as to protect end-users' freedom of choice. The participants drew up further recommendations for standardised network access by services. Thanks to an open interface, service providers will enjoy network access to customers at all times via network operators. If, at a later date, the customer opts for a different service provider on the same fibre-optic network, the switch will be possible without any technical complications.|$|R

40|$|The {{elastic stress}} {{transfer}} taking place across the fibre/matrix interface is analysed for the fibre pull-out test {{by means of}} both micromechanics and finite element (FE) analyses. A special focus {{has been placed on}} how fibre volume fraction, V(f), affects the interface shear stress fields in the model composites containing both single and <b>multiple</b> <b>fibres.</b> In a so-called 'three-cylinder model', where a fibre, a matrix and a composite medium are coaxially located, the constraint imposed on the central fibre due to the surrounding fibres is properly evaluated. It is shown in the FE analysis that the differences in stress distributions between the composite models containing single and <b>multiple</b> <b>fibres</b> become increasingly prominent with increasing V(f). The principal effect of the presence of surrounding fibres in the multiple-fibre composite model is to suppress effectively the development of stress concentration near the embedded fibre end and thus eliminate the possibility of debond initiation from this region for all V(f) considered. This is {{in sharp contrast to the}} single-fibre composite model, in which the interfacial debond can propagate from the embedded end if V(f) is larger than a critical value. These findings are essentially consistent with the results from micromechanics analysis on the same specimen geometry. The implications of the results for the practical fibre pull-out test as a means of measuring the interface properties are discussed...|$|R

Using automatic relevance determination, we are able to perform online selection of the number of fibre orientations supported by the data at each voxel, simplifying the problem of tracking in a multi-orientation field. We then apply the identical probabilistic algorithm to tractography in the multi- and single-fibre cases in a number of example systems which have previously been tracked successfully or unsuccessfully with single-fibre tractography. We show that multi-fibre tractography offers significant advantages in sensitivity when tracking non-dominant fibre populations, but does not dramatically change tractography results for the dominant pathways...|$|R

These decompositions being birationally invariant, birational versions of these geometries, based on the (or ` Kodaira) dimension will be considered, rather. A crucial feature of these decompositions is indeed that, {{in order to deal with}} <b>multiple</b> <b>fibres</b> of fibrations, they need to take place in the larger category of `geometric orbifolds' (X| Δ). These are `virtual ramified covers' of varieties, which `virtually eliminate' <b>multiple</b> <b>fibres</b> of fibrations. Although formally the same as the `pairs' of the LMMP (see kmm, KM, BCHM and the references there), they are here fully geometric objects equipped with the usual geometric invariants of varieties, such as sheaves of (symmetric) differential forms, fundamental group, Kobayashi pseudometric, integral points, morphisms and rational maps.

40|$|Abstract — Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) {{has become}} an {{indispensable}} tool for studying white matter both in normal populations and in populations with brain disorders. This paper describes a direct extension of diffusion spectrum magnetic resonance image tractography of <b>multiple</b> <b>fibre</b> orientation. Using this data the on line selection of number of fibre orientations supported by the data at each voxel are performed, simplifying the problem of tracking in a multiorientation field. The multi fiber approach has a direct equivalent in the single fiber case, {{but it can be}} able to assess the advantages of increasing the local model complexity, while other factors remain constant. The dominant pathway from a region remains the same between single- and multi-fibre approaches, but the multi-fibre approach is more sensitive to secondary or subordinate pathways...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} extends our {{previous}} work to enable fast axonal diameter mapping from diffusion MRI {{data in the}} presence of <b>multiple</b> <b>fibre</b> populations within a voxel. Most of the existing mi-crostructure imaging techniques use non-linear algorithms to fit their data models and consequently, they are computationally expensive and usually slow. Moreover, most of them assume a single axon orientation while numerous regions of the brain actually present more complex configurations, e. g. fiber crossing. We present a flexible framework, based on convex optimisation, that enables fast and accurate reconstructions of the microstructure organisation, not limited to areas where the white matter is coherently oriented. We show through numerical simulations the ability of our method to correctly estimate the microstructure features (mean axon diameter and intra-cellular volume fraction) in crossing regions...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Significant {{research}} {{has been carried out}} in terms of development of new BRDF instruments, however there is still little research available regarding spectral BRDF measurements of human skin. This study aims to investigate the variation in human skin reflectance using a new fibre optic based spectral-BRDF measurement device. Design/methodology/approach: Design of our system mainly involves use of <b>multiple</b> <b>fibre</b> optics to illuminate and detect light reflected from a sample, while a hemispherical dome was 3 D printed to mount the fibres at various slant/tilt angles. In order to investigate the spectral differences in BRDF of human skin, 3 narrowband filters in the visible spectrum were used while measurements were taken {{from the back of the}} hand for Caucasian and Asian skin types. Findings: The experiments demonstrate that the BRDF of human skin varies with wavelengths in the visible spectrum and it is also different for Caucasian and Asian skin types. Both skin types exhibit off-specular reflection with increase in angle of incidence and show less variation with respect to viewing angles when the angle of incidence is normal to the surface. Research limitations/implications: A database of spectral BRDF measurements of human skin will not only help in creating realistic skin renderings but also in development of novel skin reflectance models for biomedical and machine vision applications. The measurements would also provide means to validate the predictions from existing light transport/ spectral simulation models for human skin and will ultimately help in the accurate diagnosis and simulation of various skin disorders. Practical implications: Originality/value: Our proposed system provides fast scatter measurements by utilising <b>multiple</b> <b>fibres</b> to detect light simultaneously at different angles while also allowing easy switching between incident light directions. Due to its flexible design and contact based measurements, the device is independent of errors due to sample movements and does not require any image registration. Also, measurements taken from the device show that the BRDF of skin varies significantly in the visible spectrum and it is different for Caucasian and Asian skin types...|$|R
40|$|The stress {{concentrations}} around broken fibres are {{a crucial}} part of strength models for unidirectional composites. These stress concentrations are often calculated from the solution of a single broken fibre and then linearly superposed to obtain the stress concentrations around <b>multiple</b> broken <b>fibres.</b> By using the finite element method, this paper shows that the linear superposition may be inaccurate for predicting the stress concentrations around <b>multiple</b> broken <b>fibres.</b> The discrepancy increases with decreased distance between the broken fibres. In the case of two broken fibres, the relative error is limited to about 5 %. However, with more than two broken fibres, linear superposition becomes increasingly inaccurate.

These results demonstrate the need for an improved superposition principle to increase accuracy of strength models for unidirectional composites. status: publishe...|$|R
