500|$|Eckhart first gained wide {{exposure}} in 2000 as George, a ponytailed, goateed biker, in Steven Soderbergh's drama Erin Brockovich. The film {{was met with}} reasonable reviews, and was a box office success, earning $256million worldwide. His performance was well received by critics; Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman wrote that Eckhart [...] "may be playing {{a bit of an}} ideal [...] but he makes goodness as palpable as he did yuppie evil in 'In the Company of Men'." [...] In an August 2004 interview, Eckhart claimed that he had not worked for nearly a year before he was cast in the movie. [...] "I felt like I sort of was getting away from what I wanted to do as an actor. [...] I had nine months off, but it wasn't a vacation. Sure, I didn't earn any money for nine months, but every day I was reading scripts, I was producing my own <b>material,</b> <b>I</b> was taking meetings, I was working on my craft." ...|$|E
500|$|Sander {{considered}} [...] "ShutDOWN" [...] as [...] "the absolute {{highlight of}} the album", comparing it to the Porcupine Tree track [...] "Russia on Ice".

[...] Gordon described the instrumental parts of the album as [...] "powerful and purposeful: an integral part of each composition rather than an excuse to merely 'jam.'" [...] Sander praised the tracks [...] "The New Math" [...] and [...] "Dirt from a Holy Place", but criticized the more experimental [...] "Horseshoes and B-52s": [...] "to me it sometimes sounds like some random cutting and pasting was done on this track, leaving out a couple of seconds here and there." [...] He criticized the track's video as [...] "nearly unbearable to watch. If some video games are bad for people with epilepsy, this video is going to instantly kill them." ...|$|E

500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source <b>material,</b> <b>I</b> have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E

In the poem, 'Atrocities,' which concerned the killing of German prisoners by their British counterparts, the early draft shows that some lines were cut and others watered down.
