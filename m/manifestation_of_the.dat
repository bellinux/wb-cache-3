5|$|Buddhist teachings {{describe}} {{that the mind}} manifests moment to moment as sense impressions and mental phenomena that are continuously changing. The moment-by-moment <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mind-stream {{has been described as}} happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, or analyses the material body including the organ brain. The <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mind-stream is also described as being influenced by physical laws, biological laws, psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.|$|E
5|$|A {{separate}} <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christmas truce in December 1914 {{occurred on}} the Eastern front, where the first move originated from the Austro-Hungarian commanders, at some uncertain level of the military hierarchy.

5|$|Although not {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} an apotropaic, mirrors {{have been used to}} ward off vampires when placed, facing outwards, on a door (in some cultures, vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow, perhaps as a <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vampire's lack of a soul). This attribute is not universal (the Greek vrykolakas/tympanios was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati is a <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anti-social and inauspicious {{elements}} in women {{and is an}} antithesis to the goddess Lakshmi. Like Alakshmi, Dhumavati rules over the four months of the rainy season, when even solar light is obscured by the evil water spirit. This coincides with Chaturmas, a period during the year when the god Vishnu sleeps. At that time, darkness rules and the soul loses its usual luster. This period is considered inauspicious, and as such as no auspicious ceremonies like marriage can take place.|$|E

5|$|His {{aversion to}} the {{imposition}} of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people's 'mental enslavement', the foundations of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole point}} is that we are the song. The self is coming from a state of pure awareness, from the state of being. All the rest that comes about in the outward <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{physical}} world (including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song is really about transcending and {{about the quality of the}} transcendent.|$|E
5|$|This {{larger scale}} {{building}} activity, from the mid-8th century on, was a <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emergence of tribal organisms, a new civilizational quality that represented rather efficient proto-political organizations and social structures {{on a new}} level. They were based on these fortifications, defensive objects, of which the mid-8th century and later Vistulan gords in Lesser Poland are a good example. The threat coming from the Avar state in Pannonia could have had provided the original motivation for the construction projects.|$|E

5|$|Tunneling {{diffusion}} is {{a physical}} <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quantum tunneling effect involving particles tunneling across diffusion barriers. It can occur {{in the case of}} low diffusing particle mass and low Ediff, and has been observed in the case of hydrogen diffusion on tungsten and copper surfaces. The phenomenon is unique in that in the regime where the tunneling mechanism dominates, the diffusion rate is nearly temperature-independent.|$|E
5|$|Vithoba, {{also known}} as Vi(t)thal(a) and Panduranga, is a Hindu god {{predominantly}} worshipped in the Indian states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. He is generally considered a <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> god Vishnu or his avatar, Krishna. Vithoba is often depicted as a dark young boy, standing arms akimbo on a brick, sometimes accompanied by his main consort Rakhumai.|$|E
5|$|Established {{traits are}} not immutable; traits that have high fitness in one {{environmental}} context {{may be much}} less fit if environmental conditions change. In the absence of natural selection to preserve such a trait, it becomes more variable and deteriorate over time, possibly resulting in a vestigial <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trait, also called evolutionary baggage. In many circumstances, the apparently vestigial structure may retain a limited functionality, or may be co-opted for other advantageous traits in a phenomenon known as preadaptation. A famous example of a vestigial structure, {{the eye of the}} blind mole-rat, is believed to retain function in photoperiod perception.|$|E

5|$|In Celtic folklore, {{the bird}} {{appears on the}} {{shoulder}} of the dying Cú Chulainn, and could also be a <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Morrígan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the hooded crow is associated with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to them to keep them from attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a hooded crow – if it flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E
5|$|Some temples kept sacred animals, {{which were}} {{believed}} to be manifestations of the temple god's ba {{in the same way that}} cult images were. Each of these sacred animals was kept in the temple and worshipped for a certain length of time, ranging from a year to the lifetime of the animal. At the end of that time, it was replaced with a new animal of the same species, which was selected by a divine oracle or based on specific markings that were supposed to indicate its sacred nature. Among the most prominent of these animals were the Apis bull, worshipped at Memphis as a <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Memphite god Ptah, and the falcon at Edfu who represented the falcon god Horus.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution further {{provides}} for the composition of a parliament which encompasses members of parliament (MPs) elected through Single Member Constituencies and Group Representation Constituencies, Non-constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) and Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs). MPs are representatives of the electorate and have the role of raising concerns that the people may have. The Government's view is that representative democracy is better understood as regarding political parties rather than individual MPs as the fundamental element in the political system. While the judiciary is not a direct <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept of representative democracy, {{it serves as a}} check on the Government and the legislature by ensuring that their powers are exercised within the limits established by the Constitution, such as the fundamental liberties in Part IV.|$|E

5|$|The Kalam {{people of}} New Guinea {{highlands}} called it konmayd, and deemed {{it a good}} bird; if it came and chattered when a new garden was tilled, {{then there would be}} good crops. It is said to be taking care of pigs if it is darting and calling around them. It may also be the <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ghost of paternal relatives to the Kalam. Called the kuritoro bird in New Guinea's eastern highlands, its appearance was significant in the mourning ceremony by a widow for her dead husband. She would offer him banana flowers; the presence of the bird singing nearby would confirm that the dead man's soul had taken the offering.|$|E

Soon after, Tyler leaves the house without notice. When a member of Project Mayhem is killed by the police during a botched sabotage operation, the Narrator tries {{to shut down the}} project. Seeking Tyler, he follows evidence of Tyler's national travels. In one city, a Project Mayhem member greets the Narrator as Tyler Durden. The Narrator calls Marla from his hotel room and discovers that Marla also believes him to be Tyler. Tyler suddenly appears in his hotel room, and reveals that they are dissociated personalities in the same body. When the Narrator has believed himself to be asleep, Tyler has been controlling his body and traveling to different locations.|$|E
5|$|The {{complex is}} {{markedly}} {{different from those}} built during the 4th Dynasty (c. 2613–2494 BC) in its size, architecture and location, being at Saqqara rather than Gizah.

Some 1500 years after its construction, the pyramid complex was restored under Ramses II. During the much later Saite period (664–525 BC), it was used as a cemetery.|$|E
