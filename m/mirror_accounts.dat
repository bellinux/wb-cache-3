40|$|Abstract. In the High Average Power Laser (HAPL) program, we are {{developing}} an integrated target tracking and engagement {{system designed to}} track in three dimensions an IFE target traveling 50 - 100 m/s and to steer simulated driver beams so as to engage it at chamber center with ± 20 mm accuracy. The system consists of separate axial and transverse target detection techniques, and a short-pulse “glint ” laser to provide final steering instructions for beamlet alignment and target engagement by using the target itself as the final reference point. The glint laser overfills the target with a pulsed illumination beam 1 - 2 ms before chamber center, thus reflecting a “glint ” off the target in all directions. The glint return propagates back through the driver beamline and is collinear to the outgoing driver beam except for an offset determined by a wedged dichroic mirror. The wedged <b>mirror</b> <b>accounts</b> for the predefined transit distance of the target between the glint location and the driver beam arrival. This technique allows both the glint return and the driver beam to share a common path. Thus, the glint return represents the target’s final position, but at a small discrete offset from chamber center, and therefore {{can be used to}} steer the driver beams to intercept the target at chamber center. We are currently prototyping this tracking and engagement system on the tabletop at reduced speeds and dimensions to verify feasibility. All subsystems have been characterized and currently we are integrating the glint system into the tabletop demo and using the glint return signal to provide the final steering instructions for the mirror. The glint system’s integration into the tracking and engagement demo and current engagement results are reported. 1...|$|E

40|$|Background The {{importance}} of early intervention approaches {{for the treatment}} of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been increasingly acknowledged. Parenting programmes (PPs) are recommended for use with preschool children with ADHD. However, low ‘take-up’ and high ‘drop-out’ rates compromise the effectiveness of such programmes within the community. Methods This qualitative study examined the views of 25 parents and 18 practitioners regarding currently available PPs for preschool children with ADHD-type problems in the UK. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken to identify both barriers and facilitators associated with programme access, programme effectiveness, and continued engagement. Results and conclusions Many of the themes <b>mirrored</b> previous <b>accounts</b> relating to generic PPs for disruptive behaviour problems. There were also a number of ADHD-specific themes. Enhancing parental motivation to change parenting practice and providing an intervention that addresses the parents' own needs (e. g. in relation to self-confidence, depression or parental ADHD), in addition to those of the child, were considered of particular importance. Comparisons between the views of parents and practitioners highlighted a need to increase awareness of parental psychological barriers among practitioners and for better programme advertising generally. Clinical implications and specific recommendations drawn from these findings are discussed and presented...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAdaptive optics offer {{the potential to}} reduce the high cost and long lead time associated with manufacturing mirrors for spaced-based telescopes by allowing lighter materials to be substituted. These lighter materials lack the optical performance of traditional space-based mirrors. Deformable mirrors {{could be used to}} correct for surface aberrations in order to improve the optical quality by altering their surface to adjust the wavefront. Research focused on placing a deformable mirror at the exit pupil of a simulated telescope. Experimental work first studied a severely degraded one-meter carbon fiber reinforced polymer mirror to establish a baseline. Simulations were conducted to see how a notional deformable mirror would be able to negate the optical effects due to a distorted mirror in combination with field angle effects. Results from the investigation showed that a deformable mirror yielded the greatest benefit when applied to a distorted mirror surface. Increasing the actuator count on the deformable mirror boosted the root mean square performance across all field angles. Increasing the actuator stroke yielded minimal benefits after a certain reduction in wavefront had already been achieved. Further research is recommended to focus on using a continuous deformable <b>mirror</b> to <b>account</b> for field angle effects. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R

The main channel through which the external balances play a role is via the banking sector, which is modelled as engaging in international borrowing.

Finally finite element analysis method was adopted to get the optimization results analyzed and compared with the traditional triangular lightweight model. Analysis results prove that: the new mirror is superior to the traditional model in surface accuracy and structural rigidity, PV value, RMS value and the lightweight rate. With enough high dynamic-static stiffness and thermal stability, this kind of mirror can meet the demand under the self-weight and the random vibration environment respectively.

[...] While TH was looking into a mirror, the researcher held an object behind TH in such a way so it was reflected in the mirror. Due to his belief that mirrors represent a separate place, TH tried to reach into the mirror to retrieve the object rather than reaching over his shoulder. TH’s <b>mirror</b> agnosia <b>accounts</b> for the development of the delusional idea. Because not all patients with mirror agnosia develop the delusion, there needs to be the presence of a second factor that explains why TH does not reject his delusional belief that the object is inside the mirror. Neuropsychological testing showed TH had an impaired right hemisphere. He displayed poor visual memory and visuoconstructional problems but still had basic visuoperceptual skills, a normal intelligence, typical vocabulary, and average semantic ability. These issues are indicative of significant right hemisphere dysfunction, specifically in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Because of such cranial impairments, TH was unable to use logic to reject his delusional beliefs based on implausibility.
