The article explains some strategies of interview, which are effectively «mediated» by practical situations, graphic or metaphorical illustrations, with a specific focus on adults. The first part of the contribution explores the cognitive-critical interview proposed by Jean Piaget and adopted with children. Starting from this first model, the article describes three techniques: the «Photolangage» by Babin, Baptiste and Bélisle and the two versions of the operative epistemic interview by Fabbri and Munari supported by graphic and symbolic representations. <b>Methodological</b> <b>preliminary</b> remarks and the required skills of the researcher/trainer, as well as goals and possible critical aspects are explained for each technique. Furthermore, some examples of images or materials used or elaborated within research or training projects are provided.

40|$|It {{has become}} {{reasonably}} common in applied linguistics and teacher training research, to investigate language teachers’ and learners’ understandings of teaching and/or learning through metaphor analysis, {{based on the}} idea that identifying and discussing metaphors can bring implicit assumptions to the surface, encourage personal reflection, and as a result provide some insight into individuals’ perspectives on given topics; however, very few studies to date have begun to examine participants’ specific language skills, such as academic writing. In the light of this, the present study adopted an exploratory stance, exploring seven Chinese MA students’ conceptualisations of academic writing, particularly the required writing assignments/essays that they had to complete in an academic year, by means of analysing metaphors they created in the ‘X is Y’ format (e. g., “writing is…because…”). By examining individual students’ metaphorical conceptualisations of writing over three academic terms during a year-long MA programme, the hope was that the results could not only shed light on how students developed their writing, focussing primarily on changes in their conceptualisations of writing, but also look to see whether such changes would lead to adjustments in their writing practices. In addition, given the fact that few metaphor researchers have argued for the investigation of metaphor-based interaction in class, the study was thus to explore the impact on sharing individual personal metaphors of writing on participants’ conceptualisations of their writing practices. Methodologically, the study also examined the validity of the ‘X is Y’ metaphor elicitation task, by investigating the linguistic contexts where various kinds of task difficulty/failure occurred and offering possible solutions. 	The present study adopted a phenomenological and qualitative approach and involved two phases: a <b>methodological</b> <b>preliminary</b> study and a main study. The purpose of the preliminary study was to investigate how participants responded to a range of writing-related prompts requesting explanations for task difficulty/failure, so that the task format which led to the most successful answers could be adopted in the main study. The main study was conducted in a context of nine academic writing workshops over three academic terms, where seven Chinese MA students were asked to (1) provide metaphors of their writing via a prompt in “academic writing is…because…” format and (2) share with their classmates metaphors in relation to personal writing experiences. To reduce the incidence of unsuccessful answers to the metaphor elicitation tasks, all participants in Term 1 were also asked to attend a ‘Learning to Use Metaphor’ training programme in the form of four ready-made graduate lectures. 		Six conclusions were drawn on the basis of the findings from both preliminary study and the main study: (1) metaphors were used to convey multiple aspects of students’ conceptualisations of writing; (2) sharing and discussing personal metaphors helped participants improve their writing; (3) participants demonstrated varying degrees of change in their conceptualisations of academic writing; (4) participants became more sensitised to metaphor, and to thinking critically about it; (5) the use of a metaphor elicitation technique to examine informants’ conceptualisations was not methodologically transparent and (6) training both about metaphor and in using it were important. ...|$|E

Accordingly, attention to the assessment of the benefits stemming from these activities is increasing in order to provide a solid base for the adoption of agro-environmental incentives and to support their monitoring and evaluation. The evaluation of the positive effects of organic and low-input farming activities on biodiversity is limited mainly by: the difficulty in proposing simple and widely-applicable indicators of biodiversity, and the substantial lack of data concerning the costs of measuring biodiversity - an essential element for a cost-effectiveness analysis. Moreover, the limited scientific literature available is based on ex-post analysis rather than on systematic data collection.

This paper studies how such reports of happiness and life satisfaction {{are related to}} measures of positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA).

Preliminary results of Concept Mapping groups with hospital-based rehabilitation staff are presented.

Research quality pedometers are necessary to aid interpretation of steps per day collected in a range of young populations under a variety of circumstances. Steps per day is the most appropriate metric choice, but steps per minute can be used to interpret time-in-intensity in specifically delimited time periods (e. g., physical education class).

It also promotes the secondary succession towards a more stable forest, which is a main goal in protected areas. The present study was carried in a timber plantation of Pinus radiata D. Don, located in the National Park of Cilento and Vallo di Diano (Southern Italy). The ecophysiological responses of saplings of two hardwood species, Quercus cerris L. and Fraxinus ornus L., according to two contrasting (low and high) relative irradiance (RI) regimes were analysed. Leaf and tree ring d 13 C values were employed as indicators of water use efﬁciency (WUE) to explore plant responses to light regime. A <b>preliminary</b> <b>methodological</b> comparison between bulk wood and extracted holocellulose showed no signiﬁcant differences in d 13 C between the two materials. Results indicate lower d 13 C values, thus suggesting a lower WUE, at higher RI regimes (corresponding to heavy thinning) for both the studied species. Furthermore, Q. cerris d 13 C values are lower than those of F. ornus. These results suggest that, under the same light conditions, the mesophile Q. cerris exhibits a weaker stomatal control than the xerophile F. ornus, which keeps higher WUE.

A number of methodological questions are still open: the reliability of DVC to investigate augmented bone tissue, the variability of the errors between different specimens of the same type, the distribution of measurement errors inside a bone, and the possible presence of preferential directions. To address these issues, five augmented and five natural porcine vertebrae were subjected to repeated zero-strain micro-CT scan (39 μm voxel size). The acquired images were processed with two independent DVC approaches (a local and a global one), considering different computation sub-volume sizes, {{in order to assess}} the strain measurement uncertainties. The systematic errors generally ranged within ± 100 microstrain and did not depend on the computational sub-volume. The random error was higher than 1000 microstrain for the smallest sub-volume and rapidly decreased: with a sub-volume of 48 voxels the random errors were typically within 200 microstrain for both DVC approaches. While these trends were rather consistent within the sample, two individual specimens had unpredictably larger errors. For this reason, a zero-strain check on each specimen should always be performed before any in-situ micro-CT testing campaign. This study clearly shows that, when sufficient care is dedicated to <b>preliminary</b> <b>methodological</b> work, different DVC computation approaches allow measuring the strain with a reduced overall error (approximately 200 microstrain). Therefore, DVC is a viable technique to investigate strain in the elastic regime in natural and augmented bones...|$|R

The methods which are used in the contribution emerge from practical experience as well as from knowledge obtained from the available literature and consultations with experts dealing with the given problem in practice. The foundations of flood risk assessment are hypotheses on the impact of physiogeographical attributes of basins on the origin of floods. The conceptual framework for flood risk assessment of flash floods comes from the definition of a multidimensional conception of flood risk. The proposed methodology consists in the identification of critical points and contributing surfaces from the viewpoint of creation of a concentrated surface flow from flash floods and their adverse impacts on the built-up areas of a municipality. The primary goal of the assessment of risk of contributing surfaces was determining the riskiness of the locality with an ordinal degree (i. e., low, moderate, and high) and providing a foundation for a second stage, called controlling risk. The resulting risk of contributing surfaces is determined as a combination of danger and vulnerability according to a set matrix. Processing and analysis of the input data as well as visualization of the achieved results is carried out in the GIS environment (ArcGIS 9. 3, 10) in integration with a spreadsheet of Microsoft Excel...|$|R

We discuss the <b>preliminary</b> <b>methodological</b> challenges and some solutions. (PROSPERO registration number: CRD 42011001661) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{metaphor of}} ‘Islands’ {{can be used}} to {{describe}} present and virtual music making contexts in the twenty-first-century. The solid foundation of established islands of musical knowledge and traditional contexts for making music that exists in a sea of human values and practices can be seen against virtual islands that rise out of the sea and disappear depending on the tide. This paper suggests that virtual and present islands can be bridged and understood by using musicological methodologies. The study builds on an ongoing examination of meaningful engagement in the production of music curriculum and experience design of music software learning environments. It examines the adaptation of musicological strategies for research in these fields. The study reports upon the use of musicological analysis of music making processes and communities as it is applied to music making using software/computer instruments in community music projects. Primarily the paper describes how musicological and ethno-musicological research strategies have been adapted to observe, evaluate and create meaningful and engaging environments for music learning that enable interactive engagement. The paper serves as a <b>preliminary</b> <b>methodological</b> meta study that examines a series of music projects involving youth community music and the effects of music making on social and cultural inclusion and the creation of musical environments utilising improvisation on a computer network. This project presents a ‘contemporary musicianship’, which embraces the computer as instrument, the network as ensemble and cyberspace as venue. These virtual islands are explored using musicological strategies for musical analysis in software design and ethno-musicological methods for ethically observing and documenting multi-cultural and urban Indigenous music communities. Musicology provides a bridge between our understanding of music making on present and virtual islands...|$|R
40|$|Past {{research}} into optimism and pessimism {{has tended to}} view these constructs as polar opposites of a fixed personality trait that function in mutually exclusive ways. In the field of child development in particular, {{this has led to}} theory-driven work that not only accepts this dichotomy but also uses it to drive and explicate larger issues of resilience and vulnerability. The current thesis challenges the assumptions underpinning this conceptual framework, and, through the use of divergent methodologies, seeks to establish children’s optimism as a dynamic and adaptive process with predictive value during the developmental period. In the first two studies, predictors and correlates of putative dispositional optimism and pessimism in children and adolescents were examined. A significant age-related decline in optimism was found, but importantly a degree of functional independence between optimism and pessimism was also observed. The third study elicited more specific optimistic expectancies using a vignette methodology. This was seen to share some congruence with the earlier measures of dispositional optimism, but the study also elucidated some of the parameters and realism constraining children’s optimism. Again an age-related decline in optimism was demonstrated that was distinct from any associated changes in pessimism. The fourth and final study involved a pilot examination of the dimensionality of the optimism construct, confirming its functional independence from pessimism, and also demonstrating the fluidity and receptivity of children’s optimistic processes from an intervention perspective. From these various studies, it is concluded that optimistic and pessimistic processes in children and adolescents reflect functionally distinct pathways and drive different aspects of vulnerability and well-being. A reconfiguration of the extant theory in this area seems warranted. Based on this conceptual and <b>methodological</b> critique, a <b>preliminary</b> proposal is put forward towards a more substantive approach to the development of optimism and pessimism during childhood and adolescence.

40|$|Prospective {{memory is}} memory for {{performing}} intended actions. Unlike its long-studied retrospective counterpart, thorough investigations of prospective memory have spanned {{only the last}} three decades. A review of the prospective memory literature is presented here, beginning with earliest approaches and ending with {{the current state of}} the field. Though the majority of research has been solely cognitive, some social psychological approaches have been offered recently and these are surveyed as well. Next, a review of retrospective and transactive remembering in groups and dyads is presented. The field of transactive memory is unique in that it socially situates a cognitive and often “inside-the-head” process. Regrettably, there is virtually no research socially situating prospective memory, particularly in a laboratory setting. Given that prospective remembering is a requirement in group and team task environments, successful functioning in these environments depends upon the understanding of prospective memory outside the head. Here, two studies offer <b>preliminary</b> <b>methodological</b> approaches to this area. The first compared the prospective remembering of participants working alone while engaged in a cognitively demanding task to that of three-person groups. Individuals and groups performed comparably with regard to prospective remembering and the pattern of errors committed. The second study contrasted the prospective remembering of individuals with that of dyads while also incorporating the basic assumptions of a traditional (retrospective) transactive memory system. Dyad members completed a set of embedded prospective memory tasks and were (1) trained together or apart and (2) assigned or unassigned specific responsibilities. Some but not all of the features of traditional transactive remembering were observed – specifically, training together rather than apart was critical to improved performance, while the effect of expertise ran counter to past research. Though dyads trained together outperformed lone individuals, they did not overtake artificial pairs of individuals. Discussion of the relationship between prospective and retrospective memory in socially situated environments is offered, as are recommendations for improved methodology within this field. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{combustion}} {{of fossil}} fuels {{for the production of}} energy has already resulted in significant modifications of the earth's environment, primarily through the emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulates. The modern world primary energy consumption patterns and its trends lead to the utilization of dirtier and more expensive fossil fuels. The desire to protect the environment is contradictory Lo such structural changes in energy like the broader use of coal as substitution for liquid fuels, taking into account the depletion of coal deposits with low sulfur contents. Previous studies carried out at IIASA, in the FRG, the US, the USSR and other countries, formulate one long-term technological strategy that might limit pollutant emissions sufficiently to permit an efficient and ecologically sustainable development of the world's energy consumption patterns. This technological strategy is based on the implementation of the so-called Integrated Energy Systems (IES) or Integrated Energy-Chemical Systems (IECS). The basic idea of IES incorporates the decomposition and purification of primary fossil energy inputs before combustion, the integration of these decomposed (clean) products and the allocation of them in line with the requirements for final energy. Thus, Integrated Energy Systems represent a concept for providing a flexible range of final energy forms from varying inputs of different primary energy sources. Other potential advantages include improved performance of the whole energy system, such as higher efficiencies and lower environmental impacts. The joint report of the Kernforschungsanlage Julich (KFA), Julich, FRG and the Siberian Energy Institute (SEI), Irkutsk, USSR describes the concepts, <b>methodological</b> approaches, and <b>preliminary</b> results of the analysis of technological options and technoeconomic properties of the different types of integrated energy systems. The study of KFA and SEI, based on the cooperation with the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, emphasizes the common viewpoint that the idea of integrated energy systems constitutes an essential basis for new studies on energy systems {{with a high degree of}} utilizing primary energy sources and with low emissions...|$|R
