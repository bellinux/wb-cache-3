5|$|<b>Millet</b> cultivation: The {{discovery}} in northern China of domesticated varieties of broomcorn and foxtail <b>millet</b> from 8500 BC, or earlier, suggests that <b>millet</b> cultivation might have predated that of rice {{in parts of}} Asia. Clear evidence of <b>millet</b> began to cultivate by 6500 BC at sites of Cishan, Peiligang and Jiahu. Archaeological remains from Cishan sum up to over 300 storage pits, 80 with <b>millet</b> remains, with a total <b>millet</b> storage capacity estimated for the site of about 100,000kg of grain. By 4000 BC, most Yangshao areas were using an intensive form of foxtail <b>millet</b> cultivation, complete with storage pits and finely prepared tools for digging and harvesting the crop. The success of the early Chinese <b>millet</b> farmers is still reflected today in the DNA of many modern East Asian populations, such {{studies have shown that}} the ancestors of those farmers probably arrived in the area between 30,000 and 20,000 BP, and their bacterial haplotypes are still found in today populations throughout East Asia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Millet</b> is {{the staple}} food {{throughout}} Chad. It {{is used to}} make balls of paste that are dipped in sauces. In the north this dish is known as alysh; in the south, as biya. Fish is popular, which is generally prepared and sold either as salanga (sun-dried and lightly smoked Alestes and Hydrocynus) or as banda (smoked large fish). Carcaje is a popular sweet red tea extracted from hibiscus leaves. Alcoholic beverages, though absent in the north, are popular in the south, where people drink <b>millet</b> beer, known as billi-billi when brewed from red <b>millet,</b> and as coshate when from white <b>millet.</b>|$|E

40|$|A simple {{regeneration}} protocol {{has been}} developed for two <b>millets,</b> Eleusine coracana and Echinochloa crusgalli. The plantlet regeneration in both the <b>millets</b> is via somatic ernbryogenesis as evidenced by histological studies. In the case of E. coracana, up to 340 plants could be regenerated per 100 seed calli while up to 2266 plants could be regenerated per 100 seed calli of E, crusgalli. Subsequently, the regenerating seed callus as well as leaf segments frorn these two <b>millets</b> {{have been used as}} exp]ants for assessing the suitability of five gene promoter constructs for transformation via biolistic means. Transient GUS histochemical as well as spectrofluorometric assays reveal the high efficiency of Ubiquitin I gene promoter from maize in terms of bringing about maximum GUS activity in both the <b>millets.</b> The activity of Vbiquitin I promoter from maize was highest in leaf lamina followed by leaf sheath and seed callus. Other four promoters were found to be much less efficient for both <b>millets...</b>|$|R

5|$|Over 80% of Chad's {{population}} {{relies on}} subsistence farming and livestock raising for its livelihood. The crops grown and {{the locations of}} herds {{are determined by the}} local climate. In the southernmost 10% of the territory lies the nation's most fertile cropland, with rich yields of sorghum and <b>millet.</b> In the Sahel only the hardier varieties of <b>millet</b> grow, and these with much lower yields than in the south. On the other hand, the Sahel is ideal pastureland for large herds of commercial cattle and for goats, sheep, donkeys and horses. The Sahara's scattered oases support only some dates and legumes. Chad's cities face serious difficulties of municipal infrastructure; only 48% of urban residents have access to potable water and only 2% to basic sanitation.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} staple crops {{consumed}} during Han were wheat, barley, foxtail <b>millet,</b> proso <b>millet,</b> rice, and beans. Commonly eaten {{fruits and vegetables}} included chestnuts, pears, plums, peaches, melons, apricots, strawberries, red bayberries, jujubes, calabash, bamboo shoots, mustard plant and taro. Domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, cows, sheep, pigs, camels and dogs (various types were bred specifically for food, while most were used as pets). Turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes. Commonly hunted game, such as owl, pheasant, magpie, sika deer, and Chinese bamboo partridge were consumed. Seasonings included sugar, honey, salt and soy sauce. Beer and wine were regularly consumed.|$|E

As {{well as an}} important source of food for humans in poor arid regions the crop can also be used as feed for livestock. Its nitrogen fixing ability means that as well as functioning as a sole-crop, the cowpea can be effectively intercropped with sorghum, <b>millet,</b> maize, cassava or cotton.|$|E

It remained described as such, while the Edwards's long-tailed giant rat {{went back and}} forth between the genera Rattus and Leopoldamys. However, <b>Millet's</b> leopoldamys is distinct from Edwards's long-tailed giant rat by its much darker dorsal pelage and larger bullae. Robinson and Kloss later noted that <b>Millet's</b> leopoldamys had a similar appearance to Bower's white-toothed rat, and a more recent specimen was initially identified as such.|$|R

5|$|Cuisine {{varies by}} region, but a large, one-course, evening meal is common {{throughout}} the country. A typical dish {{is based on}} cocoyams, maize, cassava (manioc), <b>millet,</b> plantains, potatoes, rice, or yams, often pounded into dough-like fufu. This is served with a sauce, soup, or stew made from greens, groundnuts, palm oil, or other ingredients. Meat and fish are popular but expensive additions, with chicken often reserved for special occasions. Dishes are often quite hot, spiced with salt, red pepper sauce, and Maggi.|$|E
5|$|Food {{production}} at Gedi likely involved a mixed economy based on livestock, {{as well as}} agricultural and horticultural production. Some foods were introduced through trade. Available crops included <b>millet,</b> African rice, cocoyam, coconuts, bananas, citrus fruits, pomegranates, figs, sugar cane, cotton, and various vegetables, while the principal livestock was likely cattle. Sheep, goats, and chickens {{played an important role}} as well.|$|E
5|$|In two {{regions of}} Australia, the central west coast and eastern central Australia, forms of early {{agriculture}} {{may have been}} practiced.

The Nhanda and Amangu of the central west coast grew yams (Dioscorea hastifolia), while various groups in eastern central Australia (the Corners Region) planted and harvested bush onions (yaua - Cyperus bulbosus), native <b>millet</b> (cooly, tindil – Panicum decompositum) and a sporocarp, ngardu (Marsillea drumondii).|$|E
40|$|This {{report was}} {{prepared}} to help the CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Cereals set research priorities for ESA. A clearer understanding of consumer demand for sorghum and <b>millets</b> is required so that the priorities for crop improvement and value chain development are based on market demand. This report summarizes current information on consumer demand for sorghum and <b>millets</b> in ESA, with particular reference to Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia. The analysis is based primarily on data from nationally representative household expenditure surveys for these four countries conducted between 2005 and 2012. The original data was obtained and re-analysed to determine the drivers of consumer demand for sorghum and <b>millets.</b> Results showed that the consumption estimates from these surveys were inconsistent with the data on the production and availability of sorghum and <b>millets</b> reported in national statistics. Consequently, we adjusted {{the results from the}} household expenditure surveys to match the production and population estimates for each country to allow comparisons across the four countries for 2013. Information on price and income elasticities was obtained from secondary literature, while information on prices were gathered from the World Bank and FAO data sets on commodity markets and prices Consumer demand for sorghum and <b>millets</b> in ESA is driven by population growth, urbanisation, income and price. Below, we summarise the findings for cereals in general, then separately for sorghum and <b>millets...</b>|$|R
