40|$|The organic facies of Cenozoic sediments cored at DSDP Sites 548 - 551 {{along the}} Celtic Sea {{margin of the}} {{northern}} North Atlantic (Goban Spur) is dominated by terrestrially derived plant remains and charcoal. Similar organic facies also occur in the Lower and Upper Cretaceous sections at these sites. Mid-Cretaceous (uppermost Albian-Turonian) sediments at Sites 549 - 551, however, record two different periods of enrichment in organic material, wherein marine organic matter was mixed with terrestrial components. The earlier period is represented only in the uppermost Albianmiddle Cenomanian section at the most seaward site, 550. Here, dark laminated <b>marly</b> <b>chalks</b> rich in organic matter occur rhythmically interbedded with light-colored, bioturbated <b>marly</b> <b>chalks</b> poor in organic matter, suggesting that bottom waters alternated between oxidizing and reducing conditions. A later period of enrichment in organic material is recorded in the upper Cenomanian-Turonian sections at Sites 549 and 551 as a single, laminated black mudstone interval containing biogenic siliceous debris. It was deposited along the margin {{during a time of}} oxygen deficiency associated with upwelling-induced intensification and expansion of the mid-water oxygen-minimum layer. In both the earlier and later events, variations in productivity appear to have been the immediate cause of oxygen depletion in the bottom waters...|$|R
40|$|Leg 101 of the Ocean Drilling Program {{recovered}} Albian through Holocene sediments from {{a variety}} of carbonate depositional environments. Data from four microplanktonic groups (calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, radiolarians, and dinoflagellates) and four benthic groups (larger foraminifers, smaller benthic foraminifers, ostracodes, and sponge spicules) yield a biostratigraphic and paleoecologic framework for these varied sediments. Winnowed, skeletal-planktonic foraminiferal packstones and grainstones from the central Straits of Florida (Site 626) reflect a late Oligocene to Holocene history of sporadic sedimentation greatly influenced by strong bottom-current activity. Neogene to Quaternary sediments from two carbonate-slope transects (Sites 627 to 633) indicate significant slope accretion and progradation during the latest Miocene through early Pliocene, erosion and/or nondeposition during part of the late Pliocene, and slower accretion and slope progradation during the Quaternary. The Turonian through late Oligocene of the Little Bahama Bank area (Sites 627 and 628) was characterized by sporadic pelagic carbonate sedimentation punctuated by lengthy hiatuses in sediment accumulation, indicating sediment starvation and low surface-water productivity. Brief periods of siliceous biogenic sedimentation in the northwestern Bahamas during the late Oligocene, early Miocene, middle Eocene, and late Campanian are expressions of temporarily higher surface water fertility and productivity. Uppermost Albian through middle Cenomanian hemipelagic marly limestones at Site 627 (Little Bahama Bank) record an upward-deepening sequence developed over a drowned upper Albian shallow-water carbonate platform. Bathyal middle to upper Albian organic-rich <b>marly</b> <b>chalks</b> in Northeast Providence Channel (Site 635) indicate that a deep-water channel existed there at approximately the same time that shallow-water carbonate-platform conditions prevailed north of Little Bahama Bank (Site 627) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} tentative {{reconstruction of}} paleoenviron-ments {{represented in the}} Cretaceous series which was drilled south of Vigo Seamount near the latitude {{of the town of}} Porto (Portugal). Based on mineralogical, petrological, paleontological, and sedimen-tological data, this stratigraphic sequence may be divided into two main units. The underlying unit, Hauterivian-Aptian in age, comprises thin sand-silt-clay graded sequences associated with grain flows and mud flows of olistostromal character. Detrital material was derived from continental, outer shelf, slope, and underwater fault scarp sources. Many sedimentological features at Site 398 correspond to those of the outer portion of a submarine fan deposited on a subsiding sea floor. The sequential evolution of the calcite content and of the preservation and relative concentration of foraminifers (benthic, planktic, arenaceous) and nannofossils within individual sequences suggest that the sedimentation depth had reached the CCD {{at the end of the}} Barremian and exceeded it in the latest Bedoulian. The base-ment rocks beneath this series consist of tilted blocks affected by synsedimentary movements as recorded by slight superimposed synsedimentary unconformities (Group Galice; this volume) and by the reworking of material from older beds. The overlying unit (Albian-middle Cenomanian) is bounded at its base by a hiatus or by a condensed layer. This unit consists mainly of black shales with various proportions of redeposited <b>marly</b> <b>chalks.</b> The depth of sedimentation was constantly deeper than the CCD. The main part of the sedimentary supply in the black shales com-prises quartz, feldspar, kaolinite, illite, chlorite, and montmorillon-ite together with plant debris and sporomorphs of continental origin. The accumulation of the black shales on gentle slopes succeeded in smoothing the relief and progressively burying the remaining highs. The series is interrupted towards the top by a hiatus (Cenomanian-Santonian) and is overlain by carbonate-poor, clinotilolite-rich red clays (Maldonado, this volume) of Senonian age...|$|R

40|$|Leg 101 of the Ocean Drilling Program drilled 19 {{holes at}} 11 sites to {{investigate}} the geology of the Straits of Florida and the northern Bahamas. Drilling at Site 626 indicated that the Gulf Stream has had significant flow through the Straits of Florida {{for at least the}} last 24 million years. Winnowed, foraminiferal grainstones and packstones with sparse nannofossil assemblages and the reworking of older nannofossils suggest strong bottom-current activity throughout this interval. Drilling north of Little Bahama Bank and in Exuma Sound documents the growth of platform slopes during the late Cenozoic. Nannofossil biostratigraphy of the upper Cenozoic sediments from the Little Bahama Bank and Exuma Sound slope transects indicates relatively continuous deposition, with only short breaks in the periplatform ooze and/or calciturbidite accumulation during the late Pliocene. These unconformities may be linked to sea-level lowstands. Nannofossil assemblages are generally poorly preserved owing to accelerated diagenesis caused by high aragonite and high magnesium calcite contents of bank-derived material. High rates of influx of bank-derived materials appear to coincide with highstands of sea level. Periplatform sediments are largely limited to the upper Cenozoic at Little Bahama Bank. Pelagic and/or hemipelagic conditions existed during the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene. A relatively complete, continuous section of Oligocene is present in the Little Bahama Bank area, although the rest of the Paleogene is thin. Paleogene material is also present in Northeast Providence Channel, although its thickness is uncertain. A thick upper Campanian chalk sequence with abundant, moderately to well-preserved nannofossils occurs in the Little Bahama Bank area. Hemipelagic nannofossil marls and <b>marly</b> <b>chalks</b> at Little Bahama Bank contain an excellent nannofossil record, which indicates a continuous lowermost to middle Cenomanian sequence overlying the upper Albian drowned platform. These hemipelagic sediments are significantly younger than the organic-rich, middle Albian limestones in Northeast Providence Channel. The latter indicate that a deep-water channel was already well established by the middle Albian...|$|R
40|$|The Owen Ridge {{south of}} Oman {{represents}} oceanic crust that was uplifted by compressional tectonic {{forces in the}} early Miocene. Build-out of the Indus Fan led to deposition of a thick sequence of turbidites over {{the site of the}} Ridge during the late Oligocene and early Miocene. Early Miocene uplift of the Ridge led to a pelagic cap of nannofossil chalks. Two short sequences of turbidites from the pre- and syn-uplift phases were chosen for detailed grain size analysis. The upper Oligocene section at Site 731 is composed of thin (centimeter-decimeter scale) graded mud turbidites separated by relatively thick (decimeter-meter scale) intervals of homogeneous, non-bioturbated clayey siltstones. These finer intervals are unusually silt-rich (about 60 %) for ungraded material and were probably deposited as undifferentiated muds from a series of turbidity current tails. By contrast, the lower Miocene section at Site 722 is comprised of a sequence of interbedded turbidites and hemipelagic carbonates. Sharp-based silt turbidites are overlain by burrow-mottled <b>marly</b> nannofossil <b>chalks.</b> The Oligocene sequence may have accumulated in an overbank setting on the middle fan - the local topographic position favoring frequent deposition from turbidity current tails and occasional deposition from the body of a turbidity flow. Uplift of the Ridge in the early Miocene led to pelagic carbonate deposition interrupted only by turbidity currents capable of overcoming a topographic barrier. Further uplift eventually led to entirely pelagic carbonate deposition...|$|R
40|$|The Coniacian Arnager Limestone {{is exposed}} {{on the island}} of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. The {{formation}} [5 is composed of <b>marly</b> silica-rich <b>chalk</b> with a very sparse shelly macrofauna. Impressions of siliceous spon-ges occur in great abundance but flint is virtually absent. The chalk is intensely bioturbated and only the latest and deepest burrows have left recognisable trace fossils. Mapping of the irregular bedding reveals that deposition took place in a complex system of low mud-mounds. Distance between top of mounds and adjacent lows is 6 - 8 m, the amplitude is up to 1 - 2 m, and maximum dip of the flanks is 5 - 10 °. The mounds seem to be circular to oval in plan view. The association of mounds and high density siliceous sponge fau-nas suggests that the sponges and perhaps the spicule mats of dead decaying sponges were effective in baffling and trapping the fine-grained chalk ooze and clay which was swept by slow bottom currents. The currents seem to have intermittently reached sufficient strength to cause scouring of mound flanks, and mound formation was thus probably dependant of the delicate balance between production of carbonate ooze, current velocity and persistency, and of environmental conditions favourable to dense growth of sili-ceous sponges. The Arnager Limestone mounds are geometrically similar to Upper Maastrichtian and Da-nian bryozoan chalk mounds of Denmark and Upper Turonian and Santonian chalk mounds of Nor-mandy. If the mounds were caused, in part, by sponge baffling they represent a previously undescribed type of mound from the Cretaceous of north-west Europe...|$|R

The lithology of the chalk assigned to the U. socialis Zone corresponds with the typically marl-rich Newhaven Chalk Formation. The remainder of the chalk in the borehole, below 67. 6 m {{to the base of the}} borehole at 89. 6 m, is assigned to the upper (Santonian) part of the M. coranguinum Zone. This interval contains tentative evidence for Rowe’s Echinoid Band and the Barrois Sponge Bed, both indicative of levels near the top of the M. coranguinum Zone in the North Downs. There is no macrofossil evidence for the succession ranging below the base of the Santonian into the lower (Coniacian) part of the M. coranguinum Zone. The lithology of the chalk interval assigned to the M. coranguinum Zone in the Bradfield Southend Borehole is marl-rich, and unlike the typically marl-free upper Seaford Chalk that elsewhere in southern England generally corresponds with the upper M. coranguinum Zone.

40|$|The Niobrara Formation, Denver-Julesburg (DJ) and Piceance basins, Colorado, {{is one of}} {{the most}} active {{unconventional}} petroleum plays in the United States. This study characterizes those pore systems in one well in the DJ Basin and two wells in the Piceance Basin in order to isolate the impact of lithologic variability on pore characteristics. This objective is accomplished through the combination of scanning electron microscopy of Ar-milled rock surfaces, image analysis with Avizio 9 software, and mineralogical characterization by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and electron microprobe mapping. The twenty-one imaged samples span the chalk to marly shale lithologies of the Niobrara Interval. This study focuses on the pre-hydrocarbon migration pore systems in order to minimize the influences of differential hydrocarbon saturations, surface wettability, and post-migration thermal maturation. The goal of this project is to understand the basic lithologic controls on the pore systems. Data on size, shape, and orientation of individual pores were collected and compared to lithology (weight percent calcium) and grouped by fabric element to establish trends that can be related to well-scale observations. Total pre-migration porosity positively correlates to lithology (r = 0. 93) with a range of 3. 4 % to 11. 7 %, with the chalkiest samples showing the greatest porosity. Median pore size, width, anisotropy, and degree of horizontal orientation also all correlate, to varying degrees, with lithology. Overall, pores associated with peloids (always calcitic) and calcitic matrices (chalk and <b>marly</b> <b>chalk)</b> consistently display the largest sizes (medians of ~ 175 nm), most equant shapes, and smallest horizontal preference. In contrast, pores in clay-rich, calcite-poor matrices (marl and shaley marl) are the smallest (medians of ~ 150 nm), most elongate, and most horizontal. Petroleum explorationists should guide drilling toward zones of the highest calcite and peloid concentrations in order to find the largest and best connected pore systems. Pairing this information with an understanding of the thermal maturity and hydrocarbon saturations will help identify the most favorable petroleum resources in the Niobrara Formation...|$|E
40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 1975 on 08. 20. 2017 by CS (TIS) The palynological analysis of chalk and marl samples from Cenomanian sections sampled at high resolution has yielded largely diverse and abundant, well-preserved microplankton assemblages. Four sections have been investigated, three from the Dover-Folkestone Warren area, south-east England {{and the fourth}} from South Ferriby, South Humberside, north-east England. The dinoflagellate cysts present accord well with previously described Cenomanian microplankton assemblages from western Europe, and are assignable to the established Litosphaeridium siphonophorum Zone of Davey (1970). Full descriptions of all dinoflagellate cyst species found have been included. A new species, Litosphaeridium sp. A {{is believed to be}} indicative of latest Cenomanian to earliest Turonian in England. A new status is suggested for Pterodinium cingulatum polygonalis and Palaeohystrichophora pauciestosa is believed to be a junior synonym of P. infusorioides. Dinoflagellate cysts assemblages have been investigated with the purpose of reconstructing the palaeoenvironment of the Cenomanian Chalk Sea. To this aim, samples were prepared qualitatively and quantitatively and data produced from normal logging techniques were investigated using several statistical techniques. Finally, such palynological data were integrated in a multidiscipline geological framework in order to interpret the data further. The application of quantitative preparation techniques has shown that the introduction of an oxidation stage causes mechanical loss of a significant proportion of the palynological residue. A further outcome of such quantitative techniques is the recognition that marl samples consistently yield more abundant palynological residues than do <b>marly</b> <b>chalk</b> and chalk lithologies, based on counts of dinoflagellate cysts per gramme of sediment. Statistical techniques such as diversity indices, cluster analysis and fourier analysis (spectral analysis) were applied to palynological data sets. As a result it is suggested that the percentage presence of certain dinoflagellate cysts species is strongly dependent on lithology and thus allows recognition of the lithological rhythmicity. Other key dinoflagellate cysts species appear to be controlled by palaeotemperature. Palaeohystrichophora infusorioides is therefore recognised as a slightly cooler water cyst (23 °C), while Cleistosphaeridium huguoniotii and Cyclonephelium distinctum both are interpreted as being slightly warmer water cysts (25 °C). Cluster analysis has successfully identified the existence of two dinoflagellate cyst associations in the Middle Cenomanian, which are linked to the Mid-Cenomanian non-sequence of Carter and Hart (1977) as they occur immediately above and below the non-sequence. Statistical interpretation of the Late Cenomanian dinoflagellate cyst assemblage of South Ferriby confirms that it records stressed palaeoenvironmental conditions...|$|E
