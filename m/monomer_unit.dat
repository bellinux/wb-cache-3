50|$|The lower {{molecular}} weight compounds built from monomers are {{also referred to}} as dimers, trimers, tetramers, pentamers, hexamers, heptamers, octamers, nonamers, decamers, dodecamers, eicosamers, etc. if they have 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, or 20 <b>monomer</b> <b>units,</b> respectively. Any number of these <b>monomer</b> <b>units</b> may be indicated by the appropriate Greek prefix. Larger numbers are often stated in English or numbers instead of Greek; e.g., a 20-mer is formed from 20 monomers. Molecules made of a small number of <b>monomer</b> <b>units,</b> up to a few dozen, are called oligomers.|$|R
40|$|According {{to modern}} {{concepts}} a polymer {{is composed of}} long chain molecules built up from thousands of <b>monomer</b> <b>units</b> linked together by covalent bonds.

50|$|RR {{has been}} used on plant {{material}} since 1890 for staining pectins, mucilages, and gums. RR is a stereoselective stain for pectic acid, insofar as the staining site occurs between each <b>monomer</b> <b>unit</b> and the next adjacent neighbor.|$|E
5000|$|A {{more general}} {{functionality}} factor fav is defined for multi-chain polymerization, {{as the average}} number of functional groups present per <b>monomer</b> <b>unit.</b> For a system containing N0 molecules initially and equivalent numbers of two function groups A and B, the total number of functional groups is N0fav.|$|E
50|$|Dendrimers are {{a special}} case of {{branched}} polymer where every <b>monomer</b> <b>unit</b> is also a branch point. This tends to reduce intermolecular chain entanglement and crystallization. A related architecture, the dendritic polymer, are not perfectly branched but share similar properties to dendrimers due to their high degree of branching.|$|E
30|$|Different band ratios in the As 4 S 4 <b>monomer</b> <b>units</b> (as {{suggested}} by the relative intensities of the Raman bands at 234 and 362  cm− 1) tend {{to show that the}} different g-AsxSx used in the various panels were manufactured in different batches and were quenched at different temperatures. The more intense the bands for the As 4 S 4 <b>monomer</b> <b>units</b> are, the higher was the quenching temperature.|$|R
40|$|The conformations of {{organometallic}} polymers {{formed via}} the bottom-up assembly of <b>monomer</b> <b>units</b> {{on a metal}} surface are investigated, {{and the relationship between}} the adsorption geometry of the individual <b>monomer</b> <b>units,</b> the conformational structure of the chain, and the overall shape of the polymer is explored. Iodine-functionalized <b>monomer</b> <b>units</b> deposited on a Au(111) substrate are found to form linear chain structures in which each monomer is linked to its neighbors via a Au adatom. Lateral manipulation of the linear chains using a scanning tunneling microscope allows the structure of the chain to be converted from a linear to a curved geometry, and it is shown that a transformation of the overall shape of the chain is coupled to a conformational rearrangement of the chain structure as well as a change in the adsorption geometry of the <b>monomer</b> <b>units</b> within the chain. The observed conformational structure of the curved chain is well-ordered and distinct from that of the linear chains. The structures of both the linear and curved chains are investigated by a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy measurements and theoretical calculations...|$|R

50|$|Chain-growth {{polymerization}} or chain polymerization is a polymerization technique where unsaturated monomer molecules add {{onto the}} active {{site of a}} growing polymer chain one at a time. Growth of the polymer occurs only at one (or possibly more) ends. Addition of each <b>monomer</b> <b>unit</b> regenerates the active site.|$|E
50|$|The ParM <b>monomer</b> <b>unit</b> is {{non-functional}} before binding a GTP nucleotide. Once the GTP {{has been}} bound it can {{attach to the}} end of a growing filament. At some point after attachment the ParM hydrolyzes GTP which becomes GDP and remains in the ParM subunit as long as the polymer strand remains intact. ParM forms a left-handed helix structure.|$|E
5000|$|The {{functionality}} of a {{monomer molecule}} {{is the number}} of functional groups which participate in the polymerization. Monomers with functionality greater than two will introduce branching into a polymer, and the degree of polymerization will depend on the average functionality fav per <b>monomer</b> <b>unit.</b> For a system containing N0 molecules initially and equivalent numbers of two functional groups A and B, the total number of functional groups is N0fav.|$|E

40|$|Computer {{simulation}} modelling of {{a flexible}} comb copolymer with attractive {{interactions between the}} <b>monomer</b> <b>units</b> of the side chains is performed. The conditions for the coil-globule transition, induced by the increase of attractive interaction, ε, between side chain <b>monomer</b> <b>units,</b> are analysed for different values {{of the number of}} <b>monomer</b> <b>units</b> in the backbone, N, in the side chains, n, and between successive grafting points, m. It is shown that the coil-globule transition of such a copolymer corresponds to a first-order phase transition. The energy of attraction (ε) required for the realisation of the coil-globule transition decreases with increasing n and decreasing m. The coil-globule transition is accompanied by significant aggregation of side chain units. The resulting globule has a complex structure. In the case of a relatively short backbone (small value of N), the globule consists of a spherical core formed by side chains and an enveloping shell formed by the <b>monomer</b> <b>units</b> of the backbone. In the case of long copolymers (large value of N), the side chains form several spherical micelles while the backbone is wrapped on the surfaces of these micelles and between them. ...|$|R
5000|$|A monomer ( [...] ) ( [...] , [...] "one" [...] + , [...] "part") is a {{molecule}} that, as a unit, binds chemically or supramolecularly to other molecules {{to form a}} supramolecular polymer. Large numbers of <b>monomer</b> <b>units</b> combine to form polymers in a process called polymerization. Molecules of {{a small number of}} <b>monomer</b> <b>units</b> (up to a few dozen) are called oligomers. The term [...] "monomeric protein" [...] may also be used to describe one of the proteins making up a multiprotein complex.|$|R
50|$|For a homopolymer, {{there is}} only one type of monomeric unit and the number-average degree of {{polymerization}} is given by ,where Mn is the number-average molecular weight and M0 is the molecular weight of the <b>monomer</b> <b>unit.</b> For most industrial purposes, degrees of polymerization in the thousands or tens of thousands are desired. This number does not reflect the variation in molecule size of the polymer that typically occurs, it only represents the mean number of monomeric units.|$|E

Carbon is green, hydrogen white, oxygen red, and nitrogen blue. On the right side is a ribbon diagram of the insulin hexamer, {{believed to be the}} stored form. A <b>monomer</b> <b>unit</b> is highlighted with the A chain in blue and the B chain in cyan. Yellow denotes disulfide bonds, and magenta spheres are zinc ions.|$|E
50|$|Amino acids {{are natural}} {{monomers}} that polymerize at ribosomes to form proteins. Nucleotides, monomers {{found in the}} cell nucleus, polymerize to form nucleic acids - DNA and RNA. Glucose monomers can polymerize to form starches, glycogen or cellulose; xylose monomers can polymerise to form xylan. In all these cases and is thus not pliable, a hydrogen atom and a hydroxyl (-OH) group are lost to form H2O, and an oxygen atom links each <b>monomer</b> <b>unit.</b> Due {{to the formation of}} water as one of the products, these reactions are known as dehydration.|$|E
50|$|An average {{molar mass}} {{may be defined}} for {{mixtures}} of compounds. This is particularly important in polymer science, where different polymer molecules may contain different numbers of <b>monomer</b> <b>units</b> (non-uniform polymers).|$|R

40|$|A bifunctional Poly(2 -ethyl- 2 -oxazolines) {{containing}} hydrophobic end {{groups at}} both {{end of the}} polymer chains were synthesised by terminating a living cationic polymerisation with 4 -bromomethyl benzoic acid. The results obtained for the clouding point measurement using UV-visible spectrophotometer shows that bifunctional polymer containing 20 <b>monomer</b> <b>units</b> (DP 20) exhibited a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) near 49 oC due to formation of hydrophobic domains by the polymer end-groups. In contrast, the polymer with 50 <b>monomer</b> <b>units</b> does not exhibit any LCST between 20 to 70 oC due to the imbalance in the hydrophilic-hydrophobic interaction in this polymer...|$|R
5000|$|As alkenes can {{be formed}} in {{somewhat}} straightforward reaction mechanisms, they form useful compounds such as polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) when undergoing radical reactions, which are produced in high tonnages each year {{due to their}} usefulness in manufacturing processes of commercial products, such as piping, insulation and packaging. In general, polymers such as PVC {{are referred to as}} [...] "homopolymers," [...] as they consist of repeated long chains or structures of the same <b>monomer</b> <b>unit,</b> whereas polymers that consist of more than one molecule are referred to as copolymers (or co-polymers).|$|E
50|$|Despite {{having only}} four choices for each <b>monomer</b> <b>unit</b> (nucleotides), {{compared}} to 20 amino acid side chains found in proteins, ribozymes have diverse structures and mechanisms. In many cases {{they are able}} to mimic the mechanism used by their protein counterparts. For example, in self cleaving ribozyme RNAs, an in-line SN2 reaction is carried out using the 2’ hydroxyl group as a nucleophile attacking the bridging phosphate and causing 5’ oxygen of the N+1 base to act as a leaving group. In comparison, RNase A, a protein that catalyzes the same reaction, uses a coordinating histidine and lysine to act as a base to attack the phosphate backbone.|$|E
5000|$|Increasing the {{bulkiness}} of the <b>monomer</b> <b>unit</b> via {{incorporation of}} aryl rings is another strengthening mechanism. The anisotropy of the molecular structure means that these mechanisms are {{heavily dependent on}} the direction of applied stress. While aryl rings drastically increase rigidity along {{the direction of the}} chain, these materials may still be brittle in perpendicular directions. Macroscopic structure can be adjusted to compensate for this anisotropy. For example, the high strength of Kevlar arises from a stacked multilayer macrostructure where aromatic polymer layers are rotated with respect to their neighbors. When loaded oblique to the chain direction, ductile polymers with flexible linkages, such as oriented polyethylene, are highly prone to shear band formation, so macroscopic structures which place the load parallel to the draw direction would increase strength.|$|E
5000|$|Other <b>monomer</b> <b>units,</b> such as {{formaldehyde}} hydrates {{or simple}} aldehydes, {{are able to}} polymerize themselves at quite low temperatures (ca. −80 °C) to form trimers; molecules consisting of 3 <b>monomer</b> <b>units,</b> which can cyclize to form ring cyclic structures, or undergo further reactions to form tetramers, or 4 monomer-unit compounds. Further compounds either being referred to as oligomers in smaller molecules. Generally, because formaldehyde is an exceptionally reactive electrophile it allows nucleophillic addition of hemiacetal intermediates, which are in general short-lived and relatively unstable [...] "mid-stage" [...] compounds that react with other molecules present to form more stable polymeric compounds.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{molecular}} and cytogenetic characterization of a HindIII family of satellite DNA in the bat species Pipistrellus pipistrellus. This satellite is organized in tandem repeats of 418 bp <b>monomer</b> <b>units,</b> and represents approximately 3 % {{of the whole}} genome. The consensus sequence from five cloned <b>monomer</b> <b>units</b> has an A–T content of 62. 20 %. We have found differences in the ladder pattern of bands between two populations of the same species. These differences are probably because {{of the absence of}} the target sites for the HindIII enzyme in most <b>monomer</b> <b>units</b> of one population, but not in the other. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) localized the satellite DNA in the pericentromeric regions of all autosomes and the X chromosome, but it was absent from the Y chromosome. Digestion of genomic DNAs with HpaII and its isoschizomer MspI demonstrated that these repetitive DNA sequences are not methylated. Other bat species were tested for the presence of this repetitive DNA. It was absent in five Vespertilionidae and one Rhinolophidae species, indicating that it could be a species/genus specific, repetitive DNA family...|$|R
50|$|Lewis acids are {{the most}} common {{compounds}} used for initiation of cationic polymerization. The more popular Lewis acids are SnCl4, AlCl3, BF3, and TiCl4. Although these Lewis acids alone are able to induce polymerization, the reaction occurs much faster with a suitable cation source. The cation source can be water, alcohols, or even a carbocation donor such as an ester or an anhydride. In these systems the Lewis acid is referred to as a coinitiator while the cation source is the initiator. Upon reaction of the initiator with the coinitiator, an intermediate complex is formed which then goes on to react with the <b>monomer</b> <b>unit.</b> The counterion produced by the initiator-coinitiator complex is less nucleophilic than that of the Brønsted acid A− counterion. Halogens, such as chlorine and bromine, can also initiate cationic polymerization upon addition of the more active Lewis acids.|$|E
50|$|Like all polymers, polysilazanes {{are built}} {{from one or}} several basic monomer units. Linking {{together}} of these basic units can result in polymeric chains, rings or three-dimensionally crosslinked macromolecules {{with a wide range}} of molecular mass. While the <b>monomer</b> <b>unit</b> describes the chemical composition and the connectivity of the atoms (coordination sphere) it does not illustrate the macro-molecular structure.In polysilazanes, each silicon atom is bound to two nitrogen atoms and each nitrogen atom to at least two silicon atoms (three bonds to silicon atoms are also possible). If all remaining bonds are with hydrogen atoms, perhydropolysilazane H2Si-NH results (proposed structure is shown to the right). In organopolysilazanes, at least one organic substituent is bound to the silicon atom. The amount and type of organic substituents have a predominant influence on the macro-molecular structure of polysilazanes.Silazane copolymers are normally produced from ammonolyses of chlorosilane mixtures. In this chemical reaction, different chlorosilanes react at similar rates so that the monomers are statistically distributed in the copolymer.|$|E
50|$|In polymer chemistry, {{there are}} several {{mechanisms}} by which a polymerization reaction can terminate depending on the mechanism and circumstances of the reaction. A method of termination that applies to all polymer reactions is the depletion of monomer. In chain growth polymerization, two growing chains can collide head to head causing the growth of both of the chains to stop. In the case of radical or anionic polymerization, chain transfer can occur where the radical {{at the end of}} the growing chain can be transferred from the chain to an individual <b>monomer</b> <b>unit</b> causing a new chain to start growing and the previous chain to stop growing. With step-growth polymerization, the reaction can be terminated by adding a monofunctional species containing the same functionality as one or more of the types of monomer used in the reaction. For example, an alcohol R'-OH can be used to stop a reaction between a polyisocyanate and a polyol because it will react with the isocyanate functionality R-N=C=O to produce R-(N-H)-(C=O)-O-R' which is then no longer reactive with the polyol.|$|E
40|$|The O-H {{stretching}} vibrational overtone {{spectrum of}} the water dimer has been calculated with the dimer modeled as two individually vibrating <b>monomer</b> <b>units.</b> Vibrational term values and absorption intensities have been obtained variationally with a computed dipole moment surface and an internal coordinate Hamiltonian, which consists of exact kinetic energy operators within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation of the <b>monomer</b> <b>units.</b> Three-dimensional ab initio potential energy and dipole moment surfaces have been calculated using the internal coordinates of the <b>monomer</b> <b>units</b> using the coupled cluster method including single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T) ] with the augmented correlation consistent valence triple zeta basis set (aug-cc-pVTZ). The augmented correlation consistent valence quadruple zeta basis set (augcc-pVQZ), counterpoise correction, basis set extrapolation to the complete basis set limit, relativistic corrections, and core and valence electron correlations effects {{have been included in}} one-dimensional potential energy surface cuts.

40|$|International audienceWe {{discuss a}} curious {{example for the}} {{collective}} mechanical behavior of coupled non-linear <b>monomer</b> <b>units</b> entrapped in a circular filament. Within a simple model we elucidate how multistability of <b>monomer</b> <b>units</b> and exponentially large degeneracy of the filament's ground state emerge as a collective feature of the closed filament. Surprisingly, increasing the monomer frustration, i. e., the bending prestrain within the circular filament, leads to a conformational softening of the system. The phenomenon, that we term polymorphic crunching, is discussed and applied to a possible scenario for membrane tube deformation by switchable dynamin or FtsZ filaments. We find an important role of cooperative inter-unit interaction for efficient ring-induced membrane fission...|$|R
