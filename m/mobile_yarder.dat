40|$|Commercial {{thinning}} young growth forests is {{an increasingly}} important silvicultural technique for improving second growth management of Douglas-fir stands. Research aimed at advancing the efficiency of skyline logging operations in small wood timber stands is essential {{in order to make}} thinning these young stands economical. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate one case of prebunching small logs to a skyline corridor with a portable winch and swinging the logs to a haul road with a conventional <b>mobile</b> <b>yarder.</b> Prebunching involves lateral yarding of logs from both sides of a skyline corridor and decking the logs along the corridor. The multiinoinent time study method was used for obtaining data that was analyzed with multiple linear regression procedures. Predicted hourly and daily production rates were determined from the regression equations. The yarding system involving prebunching was compared to a similar system without prebunching on a cost basis. This study showed that prebunching logs to a skyline corridor reduced the conventional mobile yarder's yarding time 65 percent and more than doubled log and volume production per day. The results favored the prebunching and swinging yarding technique. Several suggestions, that require additional research, were made for modification in the system that may improve the overall operation...|$|E
40|$|Noise {{is defined}} as an {{undesired}} sound that constitutes an unwarranted disturbance potentiality modifying animal behaviour or normal functioning. Forest operations commonly involve the use of equipment and machines that can produce noise and be a potential permanent or temporary disturbance for the wildlife. This study simulates noise propagation in a natural area generated during coppice stand harvesting by direct field noise measurements {{and the application of}} a specific GIS model. Two working phases were investigated: felling and yarding operations. Two potential systems were analyzed for the yarding operations: a) yarding by <b>mobile</b> cable <b>yarder</b> and b) skidding by tractor with a three point log grapple. The results are reported in terms of excess noise area for the third-octave bandwidths with the centre in 500 Hz, 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz. Felling by chainsaws presented the largest area where noise exceeds the ambient natural noise, while in the case of yarding, mobile cable yarding operations presented a smaller area of excess noise than skidding by tractor...|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} {{analyzed}} {{the performance of}} a start-up cable yarding crew in southern China through operational monitoring by consecutive time studies, long-term log book recordings and efficiency evaluation by stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). The crew, which used a KOLLER K 303 H <b>mobile</b> tower <b>yarder,</b> was monitored for two years. During this period, detailed data recordings of 687 yarding cycles of 12 yarding corridors as well as log book recordings of an additional 1122 scheduled system hours (SSH, including all delays) were generated. Mean extraction productivity of the system ranged between 5. 23 and 6. 40 m 3 per productive system hour (PSH 0, excluding all delays), mostly depending on slope yarding distance and lateral distance. Corresponding gross-productivity ranged from 1. 91 to 2. 24 m 3 /SSH, with an overall mean machine utilization rate of 31 %. Unproductive yarding times and delays associated with the relative low utilization rate were mainly caused by lengthy rigging processes, as well as organizational deficiencies and not yet fully developed skill sets of the operating crew. The latter was reflected in a mean efficiency effect frontier value of 0. 62 based on evaluation of data sets of individual yarding cycles recorded during detailed assessments, suggesting a mean improvement potential of 38 % based on the SFA, translating in a potentially achievable gross-productivity of 2. 64 to 3. 09 m 3 /SSH. We conclude that current local operating conditions including insufficient planning, implementation and logistics and in particular, frequent discontinuations of system operations of up to three months all resulting in generally low operation hours per shift and per year, inhibit efficient operations and rapid skill development. These circumstances also inhibit an economic utilization of the equipment. Nevertheless, from a technical perspective, yarding systems have a promising potential in southern China...|$|R
40|$|In Calabria, a Southern Italy region {{characterized}} by a forest cover equal to 31. 8 % and by steep terrain, firewood represents an important economic sector of forest exploitation. Firewood yarding is mainly performed by means of animals (mules and horses) or by agricultural tractor, while cable yarding is rarely used and only for sawlogs. Nevertheless a wider use of cable crane is desirable because 66 % of forests grow in mountainous area where yarding with terrestrial means lead to low or negative stumpage. A part from the economic reasons, the use of cable crane should contribute to modify the forest work style, improving the working conditions and the skill of the operators. These effects are particularly important in Southern Italy forest area that at moment could be considered marginal from the technological innovation point of view. Concerning the firewood cable yarding few experiences are available in Italy and hence the opportunity {{to carry out a}} study in order to define the productivity and the operative costs of a light <b>mobile</b> tower <b>yarder</b> (Koller K 300) used for cable yarding of Quercus cerris L. firewood assortments. The study was carried out in a coppice stand, located at an altitude of 820 m a. s. l., and in a high forest, located at an altitude of 1 280 m a. s. l, both of them growing on terrain with a gradient ranging from 60 to 100 % An established data collection protocol was chosen and all the data concerning cable line features, working times and costs were collected. The processed data were compared with the ones available from literature and with the ones coming from the conventional yarding systems. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the cable crane applied to firewood yarding, when compared to the terrestrial yarding systems, and show the possible solutions to be adopted in order to enhance the productivity...|$|R
