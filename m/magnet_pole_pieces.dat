50|$|There {{are three}} types of power {{handling}} in loudspeaker drivers, including woofers: thermal (heat), electrical (both covered above), and mechanical. The mechanical power handling limit is reached when cone excursion extends to its maximum limit. Thermal power handling limits may be reached when fairly high power levels are fed to a woofer for too long, even if not exceeding mechanical limits at any time. Most of the energy applied to the voice coil is converted to heat, not sound; all of the heat is ultimately passed to the pole piece, {{the rest of the}} magnet structure, and the frame. From the woofer structure, the heat is eventually dissipated into the surrounding air. Some drivers include provisions for better cooling (e.g., vented <b>magnet</b> <b>pole</b> <b>pieces,</b> dedicated heat conduction structures) to reduce increased coil/magnet/frame temperatures during operation, especially high power level conditions. If too much power is applied to the voice coil as compared to its ability to shed heat, it will eventually exceed a maximum safe temperature. Adhesives can melt, the voice coil former can melt or distort, or the insulation separating the voice coil windings can fail. Each of these events will damage the woofer, perhaps beyond usability.|$|E

50|$|The early moving-magnet form of {{galvanometer}} had {{the disadvantage}} {{that it was}} affected by any magnets or iron masses near it, and its deflection was not linearly proportional to the current. In 1882 Jacques-Arsène d'Arsonval and Marcel Deprez developed a form with a stationary permanent magnet and a moving coil of wire, suspended by fine wires which provided both an electrical connection to the coil and the restoring torque {{to return to the}} zero position. An iron tube between the <b>magnet's</b> <b>pole</b> <b>pieces</b> defined a circular gap through which the coil rotated. This gap produced a consistent, radial magnetic field across the coil, giving a linear response throughout the instrument's range. A mirror attached to the coil deflected a beam of light to indicate the coil position.

40|$|Abstract – In {{the design}} of the rotor of an {{interior}} permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM), the bridge between the permanent magnets helps prevent the scattering of permanent <b>magnets</b> and <b>pole</b> <b>pieces</b> during high-speed operation. In {{the design of}} a motor, if the bridge is too thick, its performance will be largely degraded because of flux leakage. Additionally, if the bridge is too thin, its mechanical safety cannot be guaranteed. Thus, an accurate analysis method is required to determine the thickness of the bridge. Conventional stress analysis methods determine the thickness of the bridge by only considering the centrifugal force of the rotors. In this study, however, a method that additionally considers the radial force generated by the air-gap flux density based on the conventional methods is proposed and reflected in the design of a traction motor for electric vehicles. Finally, the validity of this study is verified through a reliability test related to high-speed operation...|$|R

40|$|A {{versatile}} mobile telerobot, denoted the magnetically attached multifunction maintenance rover (MAGMER), {{has been}} proposed {{for use in the}} inspection and maintenance of the surfaces of ships, tanks containing petrochemicals, and other large ferromagnetic structures. As its name suggests, this robot would utilize magnetic attraction to adhere to a structure. As it moved along the surface of the structure, the MAGMER would perform tasks that could include close-up visual inspection by use of video cameras, various sensors, and/or removal of paint by water-jet blasting, laser heating, or induction heating. The water-jet nozzles would be mounted coaxially within compressed-air-powered venturi nozzles that would collect the paint debris dislodged by the jets. The MAGMER would be deployed, powered, and controlled from a truck, to which it would be connected by hoses for water, compressed air, and collection of debris and by cables for electric power and communication (see Figure 1). The operation of the MAGMER on a typical large structure would necessitate the use of long cables and hoses, which can be heavy. To reduce the load of the hoses and cables on the MAGMER and thereby ensure its ability to adhere to vertical and overhanging surfaces, the hoses and cables would be paid out through telescopic booms that would be parts of a MAGMER support system. The MAGMER would move by use of four motorized, steerable wheels, each of which would be mounted in an assembly that would include permanent <b>magnets</b> and four <b>pole</b> <b>pieces</b> (see Figure 2). The wheels would protrude from between the <b>pole</b> <b>pieces</b> by only about 3 mm, so that the gap between the <b>pole</b> <b>pieces</b> and the ferromagnetic surface would be just large enough to permit motion along the surface but not so large as to reduce the magnetic attraction excessively. In addition to the wheel assemblies, the MAGMER would include magnetic adherence enhancement fixtures, which would comprise arrays of permanent <b>magnets</b> and <b>pole</b> <b>pieces</b> that could be adjusted to maximize or minimize the overall attractive magnetic force. Even with a paint thickness of 2 mm, a preliminary design provides a safety factor of 5 in the magnetic force in the upside- down, water-jets-operating condition, in which the total load (including the weight of the MAGMER and cables and the water-jet force) would be about 260 lb (the weight of 118 kg). Optionally, the MAGMER could carry magnetic shielding and/or could be equipped with a demagnetizing module to remove residual magnetism from the structure. The MAGMER would carry four charge-coupled-device cameras for visual inspection, monitoring of operation, navigation, and avoidance of collisions with obstacles. The control system of the MAGMER would include navigation and collision-avoidance subsystems that would utilize surface features as landmarks, in addition to direct images of obstacles...|$|R

The innovative devices {{studied in}} this thesis are characterized by the following principles: - These are synchronous machines with hybrid excitation field created by permanent magnets located on the same set as the armature winding. - So the other part is passive. - The change {{in the flow of}} induction through the armature windings is obtained by switching the flow of permanent <b>magnets</b> with <b>pole</b> <b>pieces</b> on the passive part. Two other features are used whenever as possible : - the global coil, consisting of a simple solenoid with an excellent winding coefficient and easy to made. - Single-phase operation possible through a proper pre-positioning on stop.
