5|$|The <b>Mummy</b> is a 1911 American short silent film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film details the story of Jack Thornton, a businessman, who {{is in love with}} Professor Dix's daughter. Jack purchases a <b>mummy</b> and plans to win his respect as an Egyptologist, but the <b>mummy</b> is reanimated in Jack's room by a live electrical wire. The <b>mummy</b> takes immediate interest in Jack, but is rejected and mummifies him. Before Professor Dix can cut up the now-mummified Jack, she returns and saves him. Jack explains everything and the film concludes with Professor Dix marrying the <b>mummy.</b>|$|E
5|$|What {{has been}} {{thought to be}} his <b>mummy</b> can be viewed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. However, in 2007, Dr. Zahi Hawass {{announced}} that the <b>mummy</b> which was previously thought to be Thutmose I {{is that of a}} thirty-year-old man who had {{died as a result of}} an arrow wound to the chest. Because of the young age of the <b>mummy</b> and the cause of death, it was determined that the <b>mummy</b> was probably not that of King Thutmose I himself.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{studies of}} the <b>mummy</b> were first thought to reveal {{a man in his}} 50s, but {{subsequent}} examinations have shown that he was instead likely to have been in his mid-30s when he died. The identity of this <b>mummy</b> (Cairo Museum catalog n° 61057) was called into question in 1980 by the published results of Dr. James Harris, a professor of orthodontics, and Egyptologist Edward Wente. Harris had been allowed to take x-rays of all of the supposed royal mummies at the Cairo Museum. While history records Ahmose I as being the son or possibly the grandson of Seqenenre Tao, the craniofacial morphology of the two mummies are quite different. It is also {{different from that of the}} female <b>mummy</b> identified as Ahmes-Nefertari, thought to be his sister. These inconsistencies, and the fact that this <b>mummy</b> was not posed with arms crossed over chest, as was the fashion of the period for male royal mummies, led them to conclude that this was likely not a royal <b>mummy,</b> leaving the identity of Ahmose I unknown.|$|E

5|$|Stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb, {{along with}} their father Lawrence and sister Candace, go to an Egyptian-themed movie theater where they see a movie about two archeologists who {{discover}} an undead <b>mummy.</b> Phineas and Ferb are inspired {{to find their own}} <b>mummy</b> and go out to the basement of the theater, where there is rumored to be a <b>mummy.</b> Candace sees them going off to do this and follows them, hoping to get them in trouble with their father. However, as Phineas and Ferb go searching for the <b>mummy</b> through the basement hallways wearing archeologist hats, they run into what they believe are booby traps; they avoid the traps but Candace ends up getting hit by them all. Eventually, she becomes caught up in raggy toilet paper and cannot talk properly (due to eating stale bubble gum), which leads to the boys mistaking her for the <b>mummy</b> and capturing her.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Mummy</b> {{opened on}} May 7, 1999, and grossed $43million in 3,210 theaters during its opening {{weekend in the}} United States; a {{surprise}} hit, the film went on to gross $416 million worldwide. The box-office success led to a 2001 sequel, The <b>Mummy</b> Returns, as well as , and the prequel/spin-off film The Scorpion King. Seven years later, the third installment, , opened on August 1, 2008. Universal Pictures also opened a roller coaster, Revenge of the <b>Mummy,</b> in 2004. Novelizations of the film and its sequels were written by Max Allan Collins.|$|E

5000|$|Uhle {{categorized}} {{the types}} of mummification he saw into three categories: simple treatment, complex treatment, and mud-coated <b>mummies.</b> He believed that these occurred chronologically, the mummification process becoming more complex as time went on. Since then, archaeologists have expanded upon this explanation and have (for the most part) agreed upon the following types of mummification: natural, black, red, mud-coated and bandage <b>mummies.</b> Mummification can also be described as externally prepared <b>mummies,</b> internally prepared <b>mummies</b> (Egyptian Pharos), and reconstructed <b>mummies</b> (the Chinchorro), according to Andean Archaeologists. [...] Further, {{it turns out that}} {{the types of}} mummification used overlaps with each other, and <b>mummies</b> of different types have been found all in the same tomb. The two most common techniques used in Chinchorro mummification were the Black <b>mummies</b> and the Red <b>mummies.</b>|$|R

5|$|Sometime {{during the}} 20th or 21st Dynasty Amenhotep's {{original}} tomb was either robbed or deemed insecure and emptied {{and his body}} was moved for safety, probably more than once. It {{was found in the}} Deir el-Bahri Cache, hidden with the mummies of numerous New Kingdom kings and nobles in or after the late 22nd dynasty above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut and is now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. His <b>mummy</b> had apparently not been looted by the 21st dynasty, and the priests who moved the <b>mummy</b> took care to keep the Cartonnage intact. Because of that exquisite face mask, Amenhotep's is the only royal <b>mummy</b> which has not been unwrapped and examined by modern Egyptologists.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Mummy</b> is a 1999 American action fantasy film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Stephen Sommers and starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, and Kevin J. O'Connor, with Arnold Vosloo in the titular role as the reanimated <b>mummy.</b> It is a loose remake of the 1932 film The <b>Mummy,</b> which starred Boris Karloff in the titular role. The film follows adventurer Rick O'Connell, who travels to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, with an archaeologist and her brother. There they accidentally awaken Imhotep, a high priest from the reign of the pharaoh Seti I, who has been cursed for eternity.|$|E
5|$|The {{body was}} 1.63m in height. The <b>mummy</b> {{had a small}} face with no {{defining}} features, though he had slightly prominent front teeth; {{this may have been}} an inherited family trait, as this feature can be seen in some female mummies of the same family, as well as the <b>mummy</b> of his descendant, Thutmose II.|$|E
5000|$|Once the coffins/mummies {{and items}} {{made it back}} to Cairo they were examined. It was found that not only were the tombs plundered but so were the <b>mummies,</b> and that some of the <b>mummies</b> were found in the wrong coffins. Some of the <b>mummy’s</b> heads and limbs had been removed by tomb robbers {{to be able to get}} to amulets found under the wrappings of the <b>mummies</b> in {{addition}} to other precious ornaments found on the <b>mummies.</b> A few of the <b>mummies</b> found in TT 320 were found in the wrong coffins. It is speculated that this could be because royal <b>mummies</b> were buried in multiple coffins so one or more of their coffins could be used by others as their coffins.11 ...|$|R
5|$|Other archeological objects found {{along with}} the <b>mummies</b> included: headdresses with feathers, pottery, statues made out of gold and silver and textiles. A total of 145 objects were found {{together}} with the <b>mummies.</b> The hairs found with the <b>mummies</b> and as offerings accompanying the <b>mummies</b> have been subject of research to establish {{the background of the}} victims.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} Kharis film, The <b>Mummy's</b> Hand (1940), the {{character}} was played by Western-film actor Tom Tyler, while the three subsequent films, The <b>Mummy's</b> Tomb (1942), The <b>Mummy's</b> Ghost (1944), and The <b>Mummy's</b> Curse (also 1944), starred Lon Chaney, Jr. in the role. Although the iconic {{image of the}} <b>mummy's</b> face is usually Karloff's, the Kharis films {{are responsible for the}} enduring stereotype of the lumbering, foot-dragging monster, as Karloff's bandaged creation is seen only briefly while Kharis is a major on-screen character in all four follow-up films. The Kharis movies also introduce the notion of tana leaves as integral to the <b>mummy's</b> survival.|$|R
5|$|The {{excavation}} of <b>Mummy</b> Cave yielded a nearly continuous succession of artifacts, which span {{a period of}} over 9000years. The artifacts were disposed {{in a manner that}} permitted dating in both relative terms through stratigraphy, as well as through radiocarbon dating to establish an absolute scale. This continuum has proved to be invaluable in relating and dating other excavations in the Rocky Mountain region. In particular, the stone projectile points found at <b>Mummy</b> Cave have been used to set the standard for classifying stone arrowheads and spear heads in the region. The point typology has been extrapolated to define cultural and commercial relationships between peoples throughout the American West. Stratigraphy and carbon dating indicate that <b>Mummy</b> Cave was first occupied {{near the end of the}} Pinedale glaciation. Later occupancy spanned the Altithermal, followed by a cooler climate from about 1000BC.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{displays}} a 2,400-year-old female Egyptian <b>mummy</b> {{on loan from}} the New Brunswick Theological Seminary. The <b>mummy,</b> which dates to 320 or 330 B.C. in the Ptolemaic era, was discovered in Northern Egypt and {{brought back to the}} United States by a Dutch Reformed missionary who served there in the early 1700s. Little else is known about the mummy's origins, but it was stored in a closet at the seminary until 1968 when it was first put on display.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} coffin of Thutmose I {{was taken}} over and re-used by a later pharaoh of the 21st dynasty. The <b>mummy</b> of Thutmose I {{was thought to be}} lost, but Egyptologist Gaston Maspero, largely on the strength of familial resemblance to the mummies of Thutmose II and Thutmose III, believed he had found his <b>mummy</b> in the otherwise unlabelled <b>mummy</b> #5283. This identification has been supported by subsequent examinations, revealing that the embalming techniques used came from the appropriate period of time, almost certainly after that of Ahmose I and made {{during the course of the}} Eighteenth dynasty.|$|E

5|$|By the New Kingdom, {{the ancient}} Egyptians had perfected {{the art of}} mummification; the best {{technique}} took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body {{in a mixture of}} salts called natron. The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted cartonnage <b>mummy</b> cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the <b>mummy,</b> which was decorated.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's {{motion picture}} debut {{was a brief}} {{appearance}} as The Scorpion King in the opening sequence of The <b>Mummy</b> Returns.

40|$|This {{work was}} {{conducted}} {{as a part}} of the preliminary study on the mass culture of Pseudaphycus malinus Gahan, an important parasite of Pseudococcus comstocki (Kuwana). The author dealt with the low temperature storage of the <b>mummies</b> in which the parasites were either in the prepupal or pupal stage. The experiments were carried out for the purpose of examining the developmental stage of the parasite most suitable to the low temperature storage, the period of the <b>mummies</b> without lasting the ability to emerge, the period from the exposure of the stored <b>mummies</b> to the higher temperature of 25 ℃ to the emergence of the parasites from them and the stage of the parasite having high mortality in the <b>mummies.</b> In the first experiment, the <b>mummies</b> which were formed at the temperature of 25 ℃ were transferred to the lower temperatures and stored at 8, 10 and 12 ℃ (± 1 ℃), separately. In this case, the <b>mummies</b> stored at these temperatures were separated by the developmental stage of the parasite into the following three stages. First stage was 1 day after the <b>mummies</b> were formed; most of the parasites in the <b>mummies</b> were in the prepupal stage. Second stage was 3 to 4 days after the <b>mummies</b> were formed; the parasites were either in the prepupal or pupal stage. Third stage was 8 to 9 days after the <b>mummies</b> were formed; all parasites were in the pupal stage. In the second experiment, the <b>mummies</b> which were 1 to 4 days after they were formed were stored at 8, 10 and 12 ℃, separately. The method of this experiment after the exposure of the <b>mummies</b> from the low temperature to 25 ℃ were similar to that mentioned in the first experiment. As the result of the first experiment, the per cent of the emergence of the parasites from the <b>mummies</b> decreased with the length of the storage and also varied with the developmental stage of the parasites when the exposure of the <b>mummies</b> at the low temperature was started. The highest per cent of the emergence of the parasites from the <b>mummies</b> stored for 90 days was gained especially in the <b>mummies</b> which were stored at 10 ℃ 1 day after they were formed. In the second experiment, the last emergence of the parasites was confirmed in the <b>mummies</b> stored for 160 days at 10 ℃. The period from the exposure of the <b>mummies</b> stored to 25 ℃ to the emergence of the parasites was between 11 and 16 days, However, even in the <b>mummies</b> stored at 12 ℃, some parasites had emerged during the low temperature storage and the period mentioned above was 4 to 11 days. The facts that the parasites emerged from the <b>mummies</b> stored for a long period were very few seem to be attributed to the prompt temperature change from the cold storage chamber of about 10 ℃ to the emergence room of 25 ℃ and the low humidity in the cold storage chamber. 天敵の大量生産および野外における放飼において,天敵の発育速度の調整は重要な仕事である. 25 ℃において形成されたクワコナカイガラヤドリバチのマミーをその中のハチの発育段階別に 8, 10, 12 ℃(± 1 ℃) の温度に保存して所定の時間後再び 25 ℃に取り出してハチを羽化させる場合,マミー形成後 1 - 2 日目のものを 10 ℃に保存することが適当であると考えられた. この場合,ハチの羽化は 160 日間保存したマミーまでみられた. しかし, 50 %の羽化率は約 60 日の保存期間のところにあつた. 保存したマミーにおいて加温中に死亡したハチが多かつたことから,今後の実験操作に改良の余地のあることが認められた...|$|R
