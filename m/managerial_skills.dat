She had a long-term affair with Roger Sterling until his two heart attacks (Season 1) cause him to end the relationship. In Season 2, she becomes engaged to Dr. Greg Harris (Samuel Page). By Season 3, they are married and at Greg's request Joan quits her job at Sterling Cooper. Their marriage is tested when Greg's lack of skill as a surgeon and consequent difficulties securing work force Joan to return to work at a department store, prompting her to call Roger Sterling to ask for his help in finding an office job. Because of her invaluable organizational and <b>managerial</b> <b>skills,</b> she is later hired for the new agency formed by Don, Roger, Bert, and Lane. Meanwhile, Greg's desire to further his career as a surgeon leads him to obtain a commission in the Army, and early in Season 4 he is sent to basic training and then to Vietnam. While her husband is deployed, Joan and Roger have one sexual encounter, which results in her becoming pregnant. Joan initially decides to terminate the pregnancy, but changes her mind and gives birth shortly before the beginning of Season 5, with her husband unaware he is not the father. Greg returns from Vietnam during Season 5, but he and Joan separate, after he announces to Joan that he is returning to Vietnam for another tour of duty regardless of her feelings on the matter, and are divorced {{by the end of the}} season. By the close of Season 5, Joan has become a full partner at SCDP in exchange for agreeing to sleep with a Jaguar executive to help land the account. This leads to conflict with Don in the sixth season, during which Don ends the account with Jaguar just before SCDP makes a public offering. Joan is furious over the loss of potential earnings and the fact that her sacrifice has been for nothing. At the close of the series, she is subject to harassment by McCann executives and agrees to a buyout of her partnership stake. She starts a production company called Holloway Harris.|$|E

In contrast, the performance of US equity mutual funds persists through time. In this paper, we report evidence that persistence is less prevalent among hard-to-find funds and investigate whether market frictions can reconcile the assumptions of investor rationality and diseconomies of scale with the empirical evidence. In particular, we extend the setting of Berk and Green (2004) to include entry costs and account for investor heterogeneity in financial sophistication, which we model as differences in reservation returns {{and the degree of}} financial constrainedness across investors. We show that for low levels of <b>managerial</b> <b>skill,</b> more visible funds, which are available to a broad set of investors, underperform less visible funds, which are only available to the most sophisticated investors. As <b>managerial</b> <b>skill</b> rises, funds with less sophisticated investors can outperform funds with more sophisticated investors, {{as a consequence of the}} interaction of entry costs with financial constraints. Therefore, for a range of <b>managerial</b> <b>skill,</b> hard-to-find funds exhibit less dispersion in equilibrium expected performance.
