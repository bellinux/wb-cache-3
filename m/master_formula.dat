The present paper provides a detailed outline of the strategy of computation in the framework of non-relativistic effective theory and the threshold expansion, applicable more generally to heavy-quark pair production near threshold.

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper [1] a <b>master</b> <b>formula</b> has been {{presented}} for the power counting of a general effective field theory. We first show that this <b>master</b> <b>formula</b> follows immediately from the concept of chiral dimensions (loop counting), together with standard dimensional analysis. Subsequently, [1] has disputed the relevance of chiral counting for chiral Lagrangians, and in particular for the electroweak chiral Lagrangian including a light Higgs boson. As an alternative, a power counting based on `primary dimensions' has been proposed. The difficulties encountered with this scheme led the authors to suggest that even the leading order of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian could not be clearly defined. Here we demonstrate {{that the concept of}} primary dimensions is irrelevant for the organization of chiral Lagrangians. We re-emphasize that the correct counting is based on chiral dimensions, or the counting of loop orders, and show how the problems encountered in [1] are resolved. Comment: 15 pages, 1 figur...|$|E
