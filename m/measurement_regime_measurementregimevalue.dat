40|$|In most {{proposals}} for {{the generation of}} entanglement in large ensembles of atoms via projective measurements, the interaction with the vacuum is responsible for both the generation of the signal that is detected and the spin depolarization or decoherence. In consequence, one has to usually work in a regime where the information aquisition via detection is sufficiently slow (weak <b>measurement</b> <b>regime)</b> such as not to strongly disturb the system. We propose here a four-wave mixing scheme where, owing to the pumping of the atomic system into a dark state, the polarization of the ensemble is not critically affected by spontaneous emission, thus allowing one {{to work in a}} strong <b>measurement</b> <b>regime...</b>|$|R

Different experimental procedures and <b>measurement</b> <b>regimes</b> are demonstrated and frequently used {{in order to determine}} this hysteresis behavior. For the characterization of the poling behavior of ferroelectric polymers it is common to analyze the poling current and separate current contributions, which are based on charging the sample capacitance as well as on conductivity. Experimentally this can be realized with two different <b>measurement</b> <b>regimes,</b> either poling of the sample with bipolar cycles or with a sequence of bipolar and unipolar cycles of the applied electric field.

40|$|After {{defining}} the current approach to measuring the hypoxic ventilatory response this paper explains why {{this method is}} not appropriate for comparisons between individuals or conditions, and does not adequately measure {{the parameters of the}} peripheral chemoreflex. A <b>measurement</b> <b>regime</b> is therefore proposed that incorporates three procedures. The first procedure measures the peripheral chemoreflex responsiveness to both hypoxia and CO 2 in terms of hypoxia's effects on the sensitivity and ventilatory recruitment threshold of the peripheral chemoreflex response to CO 2. The second and third procedures employ current methods for measuring the isocapnic and poikilocapnic ventilatory responses to hypoxia, respectively, over a period of 20 min. The isocapnic measure is used to determine the time course characteristics of hypoxic ventilatory decline and the poikilocapnic measure shows the ventilatory response to a hypoxic environment. A <b>measurement</b> <b>regime</b> incorporating these three procedures will permit a detailed assessment of the peripheral chemoreflex response to hypoxia that allows comparisons to be made between individuals and different physiological and environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} recovering sparse vectors from underdetermined linear measurements via ℓ_p-constrained basis pursuit. Previous analyses of this problem based on generalized restricted isometry properties have suggested that two phenomena occur if p≠ 2. First, one may need substantially more than s (en/s) measurements (optimal for p= 2) for uniform recovery of all s-sparse vectors. Second, the matrix that achieves recovery with the optimal number of measurements may not be Gaussian (as for p= 2). We present a new, direct analysis which shows that in fact neither of these phenomena occur. Via a suitable version of the null space property we show that a standard Gaussian matrix provides ℓ_q/ℓ_ 1 -recovery guarantees for ℓ_p-constrained basis pursuit in the optimal <b>measurement</b> <b>regime.</b> Our result extends to several heavier-tailed measurement matrices.

Rather than leaving it to the conclusions, this article takes up the subject of public sector third-party governance as a problem of accountability. To consider accountability, we studied contemporaryperformance measurement practices in the federal government, particularly as they are applied in five agencies of the US Department of Health and Human Services. Our findings are presented using a six-part “promises of accountability” heuristic which captured the many and varied uses of accountability in contemporary policy and administration discourse. We found that the characteristics of third parties and the nature of their principal-agent relations are a key determinant of accountability; bureaucratic and hierarchical controls enhance agency and program accountability; building rules and program policies into grants andcontracts enhance accountability; agencies that practice lateral trust-based forms of “relational contracting” foster cultures of accountability; auditing and reporting requirements enhance program accountability;federal performance <b>measurement</b> <b>regimes</b> tend to be “top down” and“one size fits all;” federal performance <b>measurement</b> <b>regimes</b> are primarily executive branch forms of accountability; performancemeasurement often represents attempts to superimpose managerial logicand managerial process on inherently political processes embedded in the separation of powers; {{there is little evidence that}} performance-based accountability results in enhancing democratic outcomes or greater justice or equity...|$|R

40|$|For {{compressed}} sensing (CS), {{we develop}} a new scheme inspired by data fusion principles. In the proposed fusion based scheme, several CS reconstruction algorithms participate and they are executed in parallel, independently. The final estimate of the underlying sparse signal is derived by fusing the estimates obtained from the participating algorithms. We theoretically analyze this fusion based scheme and derive sufficient conditions for achieving a better reconstruction performance than any participating algorithm. Through simulations, we show that the proposed scheme has two specific advantages: 1) it provides good performance in a low dimensional <b>measurement</b> <b>regime,</b> and 2) it can deal with different statistical natures of the underlying sparse signals. The experimental results on real ECG signals shows that the proposed scheme demands fewer CS measurements for an approximate sparse signal reconstruction...|$|R

Qualitative analysis of 78 interviews {{was used to}} determine characteristics of effective evaluation practices.

Rather, effective IT project evaluation outcomes are more closely related to the drivers of behaviour in organisations such as accountability for results, top-leadership commitment, a strong IT-Business relationship, alignment to strategy, an effective <b>measurement</b> <b>regime,</b> and a willingness to take action.
