An original strategy {{has been used to}} quantify radiation losses associated with leaky modes. A very low THz permittivity polymer (benzocyclobutene (BCB)) was used as a very convenient substrate to be easily grafted as a THz environment of integrated passive or/and active devices. Direct comparisons of the losses and the dispersion have been performed following two criteria: a constant characteristic impedance Zc fixed at 100 Ω and a constant effective widthWeff fixed at 30 µm. The best waveguides are microstrip (αT = 2. 52 dB/mm for Zc = 100 Ω and for W/H = 35 / 50 µm (with W the strip width and H the substrate height) and αT = 2. 29 dB/mm for Weff = 30 µm at 1 THz with H = 30 µm) and stripline (with quasi-null radiation losses and the best quality factor QT = 63 for Zc = 100 Ω).

The central focus lies to examine the importance of organisational factors – such as formal structures, resources and working methods – in this work. The empirical material in studies 1 - 3 consists of data collected on location in 100 municipalities during 2001 - 2002 augmented with official statistics and register data. Data in study 4 consists of telephone interviews {{in the city of}} Stockholm’s 18 districts, written material and in-depth interviews in one of the districts. Study 1 describes the extent and nature of referrals to child welfare agencies. The study shows that the extent of Swedish referrals occupies a <b>medium</b> <b>position</b> in an international perspective, that referrals mainly concern adolescents, and that child referrals to a comparatively little extent concern abuse and neglect. Study 2 analyses the association between agency collaborative involvement with mandated reporters and referral rates. The association is overall marginal, indicating that merely the presence of collaboration in child welfare has poor effects on case finding. Study 3 analyses the association between organisational factors and the provision of child welfare services. To some extent, the results suggest that personnel resources are linked to the extent of services provided to younger children. Specialisation in various forms, however, is not associated with variations in service provision. Study 4 describes and analyses the impact of organisational solutions in line with New Public Management. The results indicate that this theoretical/ideological idea has limited practicality in concrete child welfare work. An introductory section presents a comprehensive background to and the theoretical framework of the four studies. The theoretical framework consists principally of concepts and reasoning derived from new institutional theory. This framework is used to discuss results generated from the four studies. Specific attention is given to institutions and ideas in child welfare that have a ‘taken for granted’ status, such as early interventions, collaboration and the presumed appropriateness of a range of organisational settings...|$|E

The radiance was quantified using a perturbation approach, which enabled the separation of contributions from the porcine phantom and the localized inclusion, with the inclusion serving as a perturbation probe of photon distributions in the turbid <b>medium.</b> <b>Positioning</b> the inclusion at various places in the phantom allowed for tracking of photons that originated from a light source, passed through the inclusion's location, and reached a detector. The inclusions with high extinction coefficients were able to absorb nearly all photons in the range of 650 - 900 nm, leading to a spectrally flat radiance signal. This signal could be converted to the relative density of photons incident on the inclusion. Finally, the experimentally measured quantities were expressed via the relative perturbation and arranged into the classical Beer-Lambert law that allowed one to extract the extinction coefficients of various types of Au nanoparticles in both the transmission and back reflection geometries. It was shown that the spatial variation of perturbation could be described as 1 /r dependence, where r is the distance between the inclusion and the detector. Due to a larger absorption cross section, Au nanocages produced greater perturbations than Au nanorods of equal particle concentration, indicating a better suitability of Au nanocages as contrast agents for optical measurements in turbid media.

Spatial heterogeneity {{was obtained by}} quantity texture patterns on ASTER images for Jataí Ecological Station (JES; Luiz Antônio &# 8208; SP) conservation unit. Two hillsides of JES where cerradão physiognomy was present were analyzed, and {{for each of them}} we sampled three positions: base, medium and top. Vertical structure and canopy cover density varied along hillsides. For each site, we extracted the texture pattern for two spatial scales (150 x 150 m and 75 x 75 m). Spatial complexity were estimated by two landscape metrics, both based on informational entropy: a) maximum entropy (H/Hmax), in which high values of complexity are assigned to patterns more disordered; and b) convex function of entropy (LMC), which attribute high values of complexity to patterns situated in intermediate range between order and disorder. Comparing different sites of the same hillside, both metrics had identical results in relation to greatest and smallest values of complexity. In hillside 1, the top side showed greater values. In these area, the cerradão shows high trees with less density of canopy in comparison to others sites of this hillside, which provides more spatial heterogeneity. For the smaller values of complexity, there was difference in comparison of analyzed extensions in hillside 1 : for 150 x 150 m spatial scale, was attributed medium hillside site to smaller values of complexity; for 75 x 75 m, the base had the smallest values. However, the value of complexity of medium and low hillsides for the same spatial extension were very close. In hillside 2, on the base of site, which shows a cerradão with shorter trees and lesser canopy cover density in relation to others sites of hillside, texture patterns had highest values of complexity for both entropy measures. The most homogeneity site, located in <b>medium</b> <b>position</b> of hillside and with presence of high trees and canopy density, smallest values were recorded. Based on our findings we can concluded that there is a tendency of sites situated in the top and in the base of hillside showed great values of complexity, while sites located in medium hillside tend to be less complex in terms of spatial heterogeneity. Also, for local scale, the canopy density is more relevant than tree vertical structure on determining the complexity of texture patterns of vegetation. 201...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundEarlier {{we showed}} {{that at least some}} of {{nucleotide}} sequences with tumor-specific expression are evolutionary novel (reviewed in [A. P. Kozlov, 2014]). In this paper we performed the study of the relative evolutionary novelty of human oncogenes, all protein-coding genes, genes encoding tumor antigens, tumor suppressors and tumor-associated genes using homology searches in genomes of different taxa in human lineage. Materials and methodsThe following databases were used as a source of human genes: oncogenes – COSMIC (574 genes), tumor suppressors – TSGene (636 genes), all tumor-associated genes – allOnco (2116 genes) and NCG (2001 genes), cancer-testis (CT) antigen genes – CTDatabase (276 genes) and all annotated human protein coding genes – Genome assembly GRCh 38 (21694 genes). The list of cancer vaccine antigen genes was retrieved from paper of Cheever et al., 2007, where 75 cancer antigens were ranked according to their potential suitability for anticancer vaccines. Some of cancer antigens are non-protein molecules, mutant or fusion-proteins. Thus, we examined the evolutionary novelty of only 58 protein-coding cancer vaccine antigen genes. To analyze the evolutionary novelty of the explored genes the HomoloGene release 68 tool and ProteinHistorian tool were used. The HomoloGene tool searches the orthologs in 11 taxa of the human lineage (Eukaryota, Opisthokonta, Bilateria, Euteleostomi, Tetrapoda, Amniota, Boreoeutheria, Euarchontoglires Catarrhini, Homininae, H. sapiens) and the ProteinHistorian tool searches the orthologs in 16 taxa of the human ligeage (Cellular Organisms, Eukaryota, Opisthokonta, Bilateria, Deuterostomia, Chordata, Euteleostomi, Tetrapoda, Amniota, Mammalia, Theria, Eutheria, Euarchontoglires, Catarrhini, Homininae, H. sapiens). To analyze the statistical significance of data Fisher’s exact test was used. ResultsSeveral curves of taxonomic distribution of orthologs of different classes of human genes have been generated. A set of curves forms a peculiar picture where different curves are organized in a definite order. The curves never intersect after Bilateria. The uppermost position occupies the curve which describes the oncogene orthologs distribution. Right below the oncogene curve, the distribution curve of tumor suppressor genes orthologs taxonomic is located, and the difference between these curves is significant. The distribution curves of other tumor-associated genes orthologs overlap with tumor suppressor curve. The <b>medium</b> <b>position</b> in the whole picture is occupied by the distribution curve of orthologs of all human protein-coding genes. Below this curve the distribution curves of orthologs of different tumor antigens are located. The first below the medium curve is tumor vaccine antigen curve, then CT and CT-X antigen genes orthologs distribution curves are located. Thus at any given timepoint the relative proportion of oncogene orthologs described by distribution curve is higher than of any other studied class of human genes. Conclusion 1. The evolution of human oncogenome advances ahead of all other human gene classes. 2. On the other hand, the evolution of tumor antigen gene classes goes behind the rest of human gene classes, i. e. tumor antigens genome is more evolutionary novel...|$|E
40|$|A explora??o extrativista, a irregularidade na produ??o e a falta de uma proposta de manejo da cajazeira (Spondias mombin L.), quanto aos aspectos fitot?cnicos, colocam esta cultura numa condi??o {{marginal}} na cadeia produtiva. Assim, com o objetivo de identificar e quantificar as exig?ncias nutricionais da cajazeira (Spondias mombin L.) para os nutrientes f?sforo e pot?ssio, foi realizado na esta??o experimental da Empresa de Pesquisa Agropecu?ria da Para?ba, EMEPA-PB, localizada no munic?pio de Mangabeira, um experimento em blocos casualizados com os tratamentos dispostos em esquema fatorial 4 x 4 + 2, sendo os dois primeiros fatores constitu?dos pelas doses de P e K (30, 60, 120 e 240 g planta- 1), acrescidos de duas testemunhas (sem aduba??o e aduba??o org?nica). Para a estimativa da vari?vel produ??o, foram considerados apenas os frutos ca?dos ao ch?o. O estado nutricional foi avaliado aos 60, 120, 180 e 240 dias ap?s a primeira aplica??o dos tratamentos, com a coleta de 4 folhas maduras do ramo anterior ? infloresc?ncia, em todos os quadrantes, na posi??o mediana da planta. Para avaliar a fertilidade do solo, foram coletadas amostras aos 120, 180 e 240 dias nas profundidades de 0 - 20 e de 20 - 40 cm. Face aos resultados obtidos, concluiu-se que: as doses de 148, 06 e 30 g planta- 1 de K 2 O e P 2 O 5, respectivamente, resultaram nas maiores produ??es de frutos (84, 29 kg planta- 1); a coleta de folhas para quantificar os teores de P e K na cajazeira deve ser aos 240 dias; os maiores teores foliares para o P e K foram obtidos quando aplicadas as maiores doses dos respectivos elementos no solo; a cajazeira responde positivamente ? aduba??o org?nica; e, a aduba??o fosf?tica e pot?ssica elevaram os n?veis de f?sforo e pot?ssio no solo nas profundidades de 0 a 20 e de 20 a 40 cm. Because extractive exploration, irregular {{production and}} the lacking management proposal concerning to its phytotechnical aspects, the hog-plum plant (Spondias mombin L.) is under marginal condition in the productive chain. So, {{this study was conducted}} to identify and quantify the nutritional demands of the hog-plum plant (Spondias mombin L.) for both phosphorus and potassium. The experiment was carried out in the experimental station of the Pesquisa Agropecu?ria da Para?ba - EMEPA-PB, Mangabeira county. The randomized block experimental desing was used, and the treatments were disposed under the factorial scheme 4 x 4 + 2, with the first two factors consisting of the P and K doses (30, 60, 120 and 240 g plant- 1), and two controls (without fertilization and with organic fertilization). In estimating the yield, only the fruits fallen on the ground were taken into account. The nutritional state was evaluated at 60, 120, 180 and 240 days after the first application of the treatments, by collecting four ripe leaves of the branch before inflorescence, in all quadrants at the <b>medium</b> <b>position</b> in the plant. To evaluate fertility of the soil, some samples were collected at the 120 th, 180 th and 240 th day at the depths 0 - 20 and 20 - 40 cm. According to the results, the following conclusions were drawn: the doses 148. 06 and 30 g plant- 1 of K 2 O and P 2 O 5, respectively, resulted the highest fruit yield (84. 29 kg plant- 1); the leaf collections to quantify the contents of P and K in the hog-plum plant should be performed at 240 days; the highest contents of P and K in the leaves were reached, when the highest doses of those elements were applied on the soil; the hog-plum plant positively responds to the organic fertilization; both phosphorus and potassium fertilizations increased the levels of potassium in the soil at depths from 0 to 20 and from 20 to 40 cm...|$|E

40|$|High-angular {{resolution}} {{observations of}} dense molecular cores show that these cores can be clumpier at smaller scales, {{and that some}} of these clumps can also be unbound or transient. The use of chemical models of the evolution of the molecular gas provides a way to probe the physical properties of the clouds. We study the properties of the clump and inter-clump medium in the starless CS core in LDN 673 by carrying out a molecular line survey with the IRAM 30 -m telescope toward two clumps and two inter-clump positions. We also observed the 1. 2 -mm continuum with the MAMBO-II bolometer at IRAM. The dust continuum map shows four condensations, three of them centrally peaked, coinciding with previously identified sub-millimetre sources. We confirm that the denser clump of the region, n∼ 3. 6 × 10 ^ 5, is also the more chemically evolved, and it could still undergo further fragmentation. The inter-clump <b>medium</b> <b>positions</b> are denser than previously expected, likely n∼ 1 × 10 ^ 3 [...] 1 × 10 ^ 4 due to contamination, and are chemically young, similar to the gas in the lower density clump position. We argue that the density contrast between these positions and their general young chemical age would support the existence of transient clumps in the lower density material of the core. We were also able to find reasonable fits of the observationally derived chemical abundances to models of the chemistry of transient clumps. Comment: 15 pages, 9 figures, 13 tables.
