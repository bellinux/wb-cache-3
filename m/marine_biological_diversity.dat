40|$|Mankind {{needs to}} use the {{resources}} and opportunities offered by the marine environment while protecting ecological processes and systems.

Within such a framework, the conservation of <b>marine</b> <b>biological</b> <b>diversity</b> is problematic, as many conventional measures of diversity are not appropriate for measuring the types of change that require management.

Over 300 million clinical cases of malaria occur annually, re-sulting in more than 1 million deaths (1). Unfortunately, because of the prevalence of drug-resistant malaria parasite strains, existing drugs are increasingly losing their efficacy.

In response to the paragraph 9, UNEP submitted an information paper to the Preparatory Committee for the development of an international legally binding instrument, as established by the General Assembly resolution 69 / 292.

40|$|Increasing {{demand for}} ocean resources, both living and non-living, have already lead to loss of biodiversity, habitat {{depletion}} and irreversible {{damage to the}} marine environment. Furthermore, introduction of new kinds of sea uses, spatial extension of ongoing sea uses {{and the need to}} better protect and conserve the <b>marine</b> <b>biological</b> <b>diversity</b> will result in increasing conflicts among the various users, as well as between the users and the environment. Marine spatial planning as a process to allocate space for specific uses can help to avoid user conflicts, to improve the management of marine spatial claims, and to sustain an ecosystem-based management of ocean and seas. This article explores the rights and duties towards exploitation and protection of the marine environment under the jurisdiction of coastal states as reflected in two important global conventions, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Convention on Biological Diversity.

The transfer of marine technology, capacity development and marine genetic resources are key issues. This paper examines how the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), as a competent international organisation for marine {{scientific research}} and technology transfer, can inform the development of the instrument. Synergies between marine technology transfer and non-monetary benefit sharing of genetic resources are illustrated. Four key lessons from the IOC are examined: 1. Coordinating international cooperation in marine scientific research; 2. Enabling open access to data and knowledge; 3. Facilitating capacity development through scientific training and education; and 4. Governance of marine scientific research.

40|$|At the UN Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio in June 2012, {{world leaders}} {{committed}} to the conservation and sustainable use of <b>marine</b> <b>biological</b> <b>diversity</b> in areas beyond national jurisdiction (the high seas). Our analysis of gaps in high seas management indicates that a paradigm shift to a more systematic approach {{will be needed to}} safeguard high seas biodiversity from mounting threats. Experience from terrestrial and coastal areas indicates that a systematic approach to conservation planning and management can help to maintain ecosystem health and productivity while enabling sustainable use. Our analysis further demonstrates that the current legal regime on the high seas is insufficient to realize these objectives: management institutions have neither an adequate mandate for integrated planning nor the ability to effectively coordinate across multiple management regimes. We identify key elements for future high seas management and posit that a two-pronged approach is most promising: the development of an improved global legal regime that incorporates systematic planning as well as the expansion of existing and new regional agreements and mandates. This combined approach is most likely to achieve the required ecosystem-based, integrated and science-based management that world leaders at Rio acknowledged should underpin ocean management...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{will explain}} {{the background and}} progress to date towards a new international legally binding instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of <b>marine</b> <b>biological</b> <b>diversity</b> in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction. UNGA resolution 69 / 292 stemmed from discussions over 11 years (2004 – 2015) by an Ad Hoc Working Group. In 2011 a ‘package’ of topics was proposed and in 2015 the UNGA established a Preparatory Committee (PrepCom) ahead of a future Intergovernmental Conference.

This timing was fortuitous being {{at the end of}} the first week of Informal Working Groups on Marine Genetic Resources, Area-based Management Tools, Environmental Impact Assessment and Capacity Building & Technology Transfer (the four elements of the package). ATLAS work can contribute to each of these elements. Delegations in New York consistently refer to incorporating best available science.

40|$|The {{degree of}} {{development}} and operability of the indicators for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) using Descriptor 1 (D 1) Biological Diversity was assessed. To this end, {{an overview of the}} relevance and degree of operability of the underlying parameters across 20 European countries was compiled by analysing national directives, legislation, regulations, and publicly available reports. Marked differences were found between countries in the degree of ecological relevance {{as well as in the}} degree of implementation and operability of the parameters chosen to indicate biological diversity. The best scoring EU countries were France, Germany, Greece and Spain, while the worst scoring countries were Italy and Slovenia. No country achieved maximum scores for the implementation of MSFD D 1. The non-EU countries Norway and Turkey score as highly as the top-scoring EU countries. On the positive side, the chosen parameters for D 1 indicators were generally identified as being an ecologically relevant reflection of Biological Diversity. On the negative side however, less than half of the chosen parameters are currently operational.
