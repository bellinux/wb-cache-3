50|$|A {{synovial}} sheath {{is one of}} the two membranes of a {{tendon sheath}} which covers a tendon. The other membrane is the outer fibrous tendon sheath. The tendon invaginates the synovial sheath from one side so that the tendon is suspended from the membrane by the <b>mesotendon,</b> through which the blood vessels reach the tendon, in places where the range of movement is extensive. The <b>mesotendon</b> disappears or remains in the form of narrow tendinous bands as threads known as vincula tendina.|$|E
50|$|The tendons of the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus {{pass through}} a common ulnar sheath, while the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus passes through a {{separate}} radial sheath. The <b>mesotendon</b> shared by these tendons {{is attached to the}} radial and palmar walls of the carpal tunnel.|$|E
5000|$|... 6.7 to 9.7 cm in length, the tendon {{passes through}} a long and {{superficial}} synovial sheath which, passing obliquely from the radial border of the foremarm into the thumb, extends from the proximal border of the extensor retinaculum to the first carpometacarpal joint. In the synovial sheath a proximal and a distal <b>mesotendon</b> connect the tendon {{to the floor of}} the sheath.|$|E
50|$|In anatomy, a vinculum (pl. vincula) is {{a band of}} {{connective}} tissue, {{similar to}} a ligament, that connect a flexor tendon to a phalanx bone. They contain tiny vessels which supply blood to the tendon.In vertebrate anatomy, they {{are referred to as}} <b>mesotendons.</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the tenovaginoscopic approach to the bovine common digital flexor tendon sheath (CDFTS). A comparative anatomical, ultrasonographic and endoscopic study was undertaken using 26 healthy cadaver feet from adult dairy cows. Tenovaginoscopy was performed using a rigid, 30 degrees arthroscope (length 18 cm; outer diameter 4 mm) enabling a direct view of the synovial cavity and the following structures: digital flexor tendons, digital annular ligaments, lateral and medial pouches, three <b>mesotendons,</b> the vinculum of the superficial digital flexor tendon, and a slot-shaped opening in the manicaflexoria of the hind feet. Additionally, four clinical cases of septic tenosynovitis treated with lavage under tenovaginoscopic control were examined. Tenovaginoscopy represents a feasible, minimally invasive method for the diagnosis and treatment of septic tenosynovitis of the CDFTS, which allows the degree of alterations of the normal structures to be evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{document}} the normal computed tomographic tenography findings of digital flexor tendon sheath. Six ex vivo normal equine forelimbs were used. An axial approach was used to inject 185 [*]mg/mL of iopamidol in a total volume of 60 [*]mL into the digital flexor tendon sheaths. Single-slice helical scans, with 5 [*]mm thickness, spaced every 3 [*]mm, for a pitch of 0. 6, and with bone algorithm reconstruction, were performed before and after injections of contrast medium. To obtain better image quality for multiplanar reconstruction and 3 D reformatting, postprocessing retroreconstruction was performed to reduce the images to submillimetre thickness. Computed tomographic tenography of digital flexor tendon sheaths could visualize the following main tendon structures for every forelimb in contrast-enhanced images as low densities surrounded by high densities: superficial digital flexor tendon, deep digital flexor tendon, manica flexoria, <b>mesotendons,</b> and synovial recess. Results {{of this study}} suggest that computed tomographic tenography can be used with accuracy and sensitivity to evaluate the common disorders of the equine digital flexor tendon sheath and the intrathecal structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{nutrient}} {{pathways to}} the extensor tendon beneath the extensor etinaculum of young adult monkeys was investigated using hydrogen as tracer material. The {{results indicate that}} diffusion from the synovium is a more significant nutrient pathway than vascular perfusion from either the <b>mesotendon</b> or the longitudinal intratendinous vascular network. The extensor tendons on the dorsum of the wrist pass through synovium-lined retinacular compartments (Anson, 1945; Lapidus, 1953; Kaplan, 1965), and thereby resemble the flexor tendons which lie within the synovium-lined digital sheath. The mesenteric attachment to the extensor tendons consists of a long vascularised mesotendinous sheath, rather than two distinct vinculae {{as noted in the}} flexor tendon. The anatomical features of the extensor <b>mesotendon</b> have been described (Edwards, 1946; Zbrodowski, 1980). Previous tudies (Manske, 1978, 1982) of primate flexor tendons have demonstrated that although both diffusion arid vascular perfusion provide nutrients, diffusion is the predominant nutrient pathway. The nutrient pathways to primate xtensor tendons have not been defined. The anatomically similar synovial environment of the extensor and flexor tendons uggest that diffusion may also serve as a significant nutrient pathway to the extensor tendons. The {{purpose of this study is}} to define the role of diffusion and perfusion as nutrient pathways to the extensor tendon of monkeys. Such a study has clinical importance in that tendon avascularity has been implicated as an aetiological factor in the rupture of extensor tendons in synovial proliferative disease...|$|E
40|$|The Achilles tendon (AT) is {{the strongest}} tendon in the human body, but despite its strength, is the most {{frequently}} ruptured tendon in the body. Ruptures usually occur between 2 and 6 cm of its insertion into the superior surface of the calcaneus, a relatively hypovascular area [7, 17]. The major blood supply to tendons is from the <b>mesotendon,</b> and the largest supply is from the anterior mesentery [2]. The tendon is at the greatest risk of rupture when it is obliquely loaded, the muscle is contracting maximally, and tendon length is short [12]. This usually {{occurs as a result}} of pushing off with the foot against resistance, and occurs most frequently in males in their fourth decade...|$|E
40|$|The intimal lining {{cells of}} the {{synovium}} in joints have been studied morphologically and histochemically and shown to consist of macrophagic cells (type A) and fibroblast-like cells (type B). It is believed that {{the structure of the}} synovium in the tendon sheath is similar to that in the joint, but there have been only a few morphological studies of the tendon sheath. The present study revealed the cellular architecture of synovium in the tendon sheath of horses by histochemistry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Like the joint, the inner surface of the tendon sheath was covered with a cell-rich intimal layer. Acid phosphatase-positive A cells accumulated in the <b>mesotendon</b> but few in other regions. B cells were selectively immunolabeled with protein gene product (PGP) 9. 5 antiserum and distributed in {{the entire length of the}} synovial intima in the tendon sheath. The synovial intima consisted of a surface layer rich in the processes of B cells and a deep layer containing cell bodies of B cells. Using SEM, B cells could be classified into two types according to the morphology of their processes. B cells of dendritic type were located mainly in the joint-side of the tendon sheath and extended branched processes to form a meshwork on the intimal surface. B cells of flat type were located in the skin-side of the tendon sheath and in the <b>mesotendon.</b> Their membranous processes extended in a horizontal direction and covered the intimal surface, resembling epithelium. It appears likely that the morphology and distribution of synovial intimal cells are influenced by various factors, such as the nature of the underlying tissues and the magnitude of mechanical stress...|$|E
