40|$|Introduction: This study {{focuses on}} {{accidents}} in artisanal mining, to support policies improving miners' employability. Materials and Methods: Based on a questionnaire administered in November 2009 {{to a sample}} of 180 miners from the artisanal mining of LUPOTO, in the Province of Katanga, we explored significant trends between the accidents and their consequences and behavioral or sociological variables. Results: During the 12 months preceding the study, 392 accidents occurred, affecting 72. 2 % of miners. Tools handling represents 51. 5 %, of the accidents' causes, followed by handling heavy loads (32. 9 %). Factors such as age, seniority or apprenticeship did not generate significant differences. Contusions were the most common injuries (50. 2 %), followed by wounds (44. 4 %). These injuries were located in upper limbs (50. 5 %) and in lower limbs (29. 3 %). 80. 5 % of miners were cared for by their colleagues and 50 % of them could not work for more than 3 days. Physical sequelae were reported by 19 % of the injured miners. Discussion: Many surveys related to accidents in the area of artisanal <b>mining</b> <b>report</b> such high frequency. The unsuitability of tools to jobs to be done is usually raised as one of the major causes of accidents. The lack of differentiation of the tasks carried out in relation to age is another factor explaining the lack of protective effect of seniority as it minimizes the contribution of experience in the worker's safety. The apprenticeship reported is inadequate; it is rather a learning by doing than anything else. That is why it lacks protective effect. Low income combined with precariousness of artisanal mining are likely to explain the low level of work stoppages. Conclusion: Tools improvement associated with adequate training seem to be the basis of accident prevention. Availability of suitable medical care should improve artisanal miners' recovery after accidents. © 2013 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|In 2013 - 14, labour {{productivity}} growth {{in both the}} Australian economy and the 12 -industry market sector (which accounts for 65 per cent of the economy) {{was close to the}} trend of the last two and half decades. Preamble This edition of the PC Productivity Update begins by providing a snapshot of key nation-wide and industry-specific trends from the most recent release of the ABS productivity statistics. In 2013 - 14, {{labour productivity}} growth in both the Australian economy and the 12 -industry market sector (which accounts for 65 per cent of the economy) was close to the trend of the last two and half decades. But growth of multifactor productivity remains below the longer-term average. This snapshot is followed by a closer look at recent changes in measured productivity for four industries — Agriculture, forestry and fishing; Mining; Electricity, gas, water and waste services; and Information, media and telecommunications — to highlight some of the main contemporary factors influencing those changes. Chapter 2 reports on per capita national income growth in Australia and the contribution of productivity growth to that income growth. It highlights that as the terms of trade effects associated with the mining boom taper off, it will be crucial to achieve higher productivity in order to maintain and increase per capita incomes. Investment in new capital has consistently {{played a key role in}} lifting Australia 2 ̆ 7 s labour productivity and supporting the introduction of new technologies and ways of working. Chapter 3 outlines recent work by the Commission aimed at improving the efficiency of public infrastructure investment through more transparent and rigorous project selection processes. Finally, chapter 4 outlines recent work undertaken by the Commission to unpack the specific productivity performance within both the Mining and Financial and insurance services industries. The <b>Mining</b> <b>report</b> traces the transition of Mining industries through the investment phase of the mining boom to the production phase and towards positive MFP growth. The Financial and insurance services report indicates that it is productivity growth in the Insurance, Superannuation and Auxiliary services industry that has driven recent changes in the multifactor productivity for the Financial and insurance services industry as a whole...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Unreliable and {{unsustainable}} {{electricity supply}} has been experienced in South Africa since 2007. Eskom implemented Demand Side Management (DSM) as a short-term solution to alleviate this problem. Several compressed-air DSM projects were implemented {{to help reduce}} the strain on the electrical network. Compressed air {{is an integral part}} of production in deep-level mining, and is extensively utilised. Problems are encountered with the effective management and repairing of leaks, since the majority of mines have little to no procedures in place for leak management. Awareness of the condition of the compressed-air system and leaks needed to be created at management level in order to achieve the best results. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of proper leak management on compressed-air systems in the mining industry. Peak-clipping DSM projects implemented in the mining industry were used for evaluation of results. Contribution to the sustainability of compressed-air DSM projects savings through successful leak documentation was the prime focus of this study. This was achieved through the development of a Compressed Air Leakage Documentation System (CALDS). This entailed the electronic field-data capture and record keeping of field data, using rugged PDA devices suitable for the extreme environmental conditions encountered in deep-level <b>mining.</b> <b>Report</b> generation on the status of detected leaks created awareness of compressedair- system performance and leak-repair tracking at management level. Audible detection was sufficient for this study, since the focus was on the larger more-severe leaks. Leaks were expressed in monetary terms to indicate the severity. It was found that successful management of leaks could contribute to an increase of as much as 85 % in project savings. The results also showed that creating awareness through documentation of leaks, and the effect this has on the system, resulted in regular repairing of these leaks. Sustainability of projects was maintained during an evaluation period of ten months, with projects achieving on average 125 % of target savings. The study showed that effective reporting on compressed-air leaks resulted in increased system efficiency and sustainable DSM project savings. It was also seen that leak detection by outsourced companies did not necessarily result in financial savings. When the mine took responsibility for its own leak detection and repairs, significant savings were realised. Master...|$|E
