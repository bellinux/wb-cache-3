The Brazilian plant was the company's first factory in South America dedicated to passenger cars, with {{an investment of}} USD 840 million and 10,000 employees. The factory initially produced A-Class and C-Class models, assembling them from pieces manufactured in Germany. The target for the cars was regional markets (from Argentina to Mexico) with modifications made to the cars to suit local conditions, like a protection for the <b>motor</b> <b>base.</b> On 15 August 2005 the factory stopped production of A-Class cars.|$|E
50|$|These {{projectiles}} {{consist of}} two major components, a warhead filled with 16 pounds of Composition B high explosive (M549) or 15 pounds of TNT high explosive (M549A1), and a solid propellant rocket motor. These components are threaded together so that the outer steel shells of both form a streamlined ogive. A supplementary charge is installed in the deep cavity of the nose. A rotating band encircles the assembled projectile near the base. A rocket cap is threaded into the base. The cap is removed prior to firing to allow ignition of the rocket motor for extended range. The rocket motor body contains seven pounds of solid rocket propellant arranged in two segmented grains. Each of the three segments of the forward grain contains an ignition pellet. The motor nozzle is recessed {{in the center of}} the boat-tail rocket <b>motor</b> <b>base</b> of the projectile, and thrust is along the longitudinal axis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{the effect of}} motor {{vibration}} problems on the dynamic performance and electrical power quality of water pumping stations is studied.

The measurements were repeated again after achieving good support to the motor on its base plate. The results indicated that the vibration level decreased about 48 % due to good support. The electrical power quality analysis showed that; the total harmonic distortion (THD) increases by about 1 – 2 % due to the effect of bad motor vibration, and the 5 th and 7 th harmonic contents also increased by about 0. 5 – 1. 0 %. Also the bad motor vibration caused large values of instantaneous flicker.

40|$|Dynamometer {{performance}} of a South Coast Technology electric conversion of a Volkswagen (VW) Rabbit designated SCT- 8 was tested. The SCT- 8 vehicle was fitted with a transistorized chopper in the motor armature circuit to supplement the standard motor speed control via field weakening. The armature chopper allowed speed control below the <b>motor</b> <b>base</b> speed. This low speed control was intended to reduce energy loss at idle during stop-and-go traffic; to {{eliminate the need for}} using the clutch below base motor speed; and to improve the drivability. Test results indicate an improvement of about 3. 5 % in battery energy economy for the SAE J 227 a-D driving cycle and 6 % for the C-cycle with only a minor reduction in acceleration performance. A further reduction of about 6 % would be possible if provision were made for shutting down field power during the idle phases of the driving cycles. Drivability of the vehicle equipped with the armature chopper was significantly improved compared with the standard SCT Electric Rabbit...|$|E

A prototype dc propulsion system for a passenger electric vehicle was designed, fabricated, tested, installed in a modified Mercury Lynx vehicle and track tested at the contractor's site.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{diagnosis}} technique, for rotor broken bar in double cage induction motor, based on advanced use of Wavelet Transform Analysis. The proposed technique is experimentally validated. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed approach is based on a combined use of Frequency Sliding (FS) and Wavelet Transform (WT) analysis, to isolate the contribution of the rotor fault components issued from vibration signals in a single frequency band. Findings - The proposed technique is reliable for tracking the rotor fault components over time-frequency domain. The quantitative analysis results based on this technique are the proof of its robustness. Research limitations/implications - The validity of the proposed diagnosis approach is not limitted to the analysis under steady-state operating conditions, but also for time-verying conditions where rotor fault components are spread in a wide frequency range. Practical implications - The developed approach is best suited for automotive or high power traction systems, in which safe-operating and availability are mandatory. Originality/value - The paper presents a diagnosis technique for rotor broken bar in double cage induction <b>motor</b> <b>base</b> on advanced use of Wavelet Transform which allows the extraction of the most relevant rotor fault component issued from axial vibration signal and clamping it in a single frequency bandwidth, avoiding confusions with other components and false interpretations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—After {{an initial}} fault lowers bus voltage, {{induction}} motors {{connected to the}} bus can successively stall in a cascading process {{that can lead to}} a voltage collapse or delayed voltage recovery. There are typically many induction motors connected to the bus, and models that aggregate the motors do not capture the cascading stall. We study the cascading stall in a simple power system with many induction motors using a quasistatic assumption and randomization of some motor parameters, and hence efficiently estimate the distribution of the number of motors stalled. This approach is also extended to a simple 4 -bus system and a simple motor dynamics and similar results are obtained. These distributions can often be fit with a high-level and generic probabilistic model of cascading failure, showing a commonality between cascading motor stall and other cascading processes. Index Terms—cascading failure, induction motor, load model-ing, voltage stability.

40|$|LecturePg. 81 - 92 The {{design of}} a 66, 000 hp {{electric}} motor to drive an air compressor presented significant design challenges. Using conventional assumptions in assessing the bearing support and foundation stiffness yielded a scenario {{where it would be}} impractical to achieve a 20 percent separation margin between operating speed and the lateral critical speeds of the motor. Structural stiffnesses well above conventional values were required in order to achieve the specified separation margin. Finite element studies were performed on the bearing pedestals and <b>motor</b> <b>base.</b> As a result of the studies, it was deemed necessary to perform a modal finite element study on the complete motor assembly. Eventually, it was decided that a modal analysis would be performed on the entire drive train (motor, gear, compressor, and foundation). These studies confirmed that the structural stiffness needed was achievable. Factory and field tests substantiated the analysis. Another challenge in this design was the ability of the motor to accelerate a drive train with a polar inertia in excess of 355, 000 lb? -ft^ 2. The rotor construction is such {{that there is not a}} discrete amortisseur. On startup, currents are induced in the rotor pole face, which lead to significant heating. Surface temperatures in excess of 400 ?C (750 ?F) were calculated. Plastic deformation of the rotor pole face will occur at this temperature due to large thermal strains. Consistency of the shaft forging mechanical properties is paramount if shaft bending is to be avoided. A stringent forging specification was written, which limited the number of forging suppliers who could meet the requirements. Finite element studies were performed to calculate the stresses and plastic strains. High temperature mechanical testing was performed on the forging material to confirm that the stress-strain hysteresis loop would close after repeated cycling. Furthermore, care needed to be taken to ensure that the rotor winding and insulation system was protected from damaging temperatures. Once again, factory and field test confirmed the analytical work...|$|E
