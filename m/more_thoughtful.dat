5|$|Wollstonecraft was {{prompted}} {{to write the}} Rights of Woman after reading Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord's 1791 report to the French National Assembly, which stated that women should only receive a domestic education; she used her commentary on this specific event to launch a broad attack against sexual double standards and to indict men for encouraging women to indulge in excessive emotion. Wollstonecraft wrote the Rights of Woman hurriedly to respond directly to ongoing events; she intended to write a <b>more</b> <b>thoughtful</b> second volume but died before completing it.|$|E
5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be {{understood}} to be engaging in political deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being in political dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door in dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using milking robots. He argues that a recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to <b>more</b> <b>thoughtful</b> forms of both environmentalism and democracy.|$|E
5|$|The first {{installment}} of the story-based DLC The Knife of Dunwall was praised for its level design, which encouraged exploration to find hidden content and alternative routes through areas. The modifications to certain abilities, particularly Blink were similarly well received for the changes they brought to the gameplay from the main game. The story, however, was generally criticized. Polygon noted that the deadly assassin Daud had no motive for seeking redemption, and allowing him to be played as a non-lethal character created a disconnect with the narrative. IGN considered that it felt like only half of a complete game, lacking any urgency in its story and featuring a disappointing conclusion. The Brigmore Witches story received a mixed response, with Destructoid saying that it offered a more gripping narrative, while Polygon stated that it lacked the same tension as The Knife of Dunwall, and the ending felt rushed and unsatisfying. However, the gameplay was generally considered an improvement, providing more intricate level design and nuanced world building that produced gameplay requiring a <b>more</b> <b>thoughtful</b> approach. PC Gamer appreciated that the levels each had a distinct theme, and adequately provided for both stealth and violent gameplay, while Polygon said that only the last level improved over the preceding DLC, introducing new mechanics that forced changes in stealth players.|$|E

25|$|People's self-verification strivings {{are apt to}} be most {{influential}} when the relevant identities and behaviors matter to them. Thus, for example, the self-view should be firmly held, the relationship should be enduring, and the behavior itself should be consequential. When these conditions are not met, people will be relatively unconcerned with preserving their self-views and they will instead indulge their desire for self-enhancement. In addition, self-reported emotional reactions favor self-enhancement while <b>more</b> <b>thoughtful</b> processes favor self-verification.|$|E
25|$|Nimoy {{has said}} that the {{character}} of Spock, which he played twelve to fourteen hours a day, five days a week, influenced his personality in private life. Each weekend during the original run of the series, he would be in character throughout Saturday and into Sunday, behaving more like Spock than himself—more logical, more rational, <b>more</b> <b>thoughtful,</b> less emotional and finding a calm in every situation. It was only on Sunday in the early afternoon that Spock's influence on his behavior would fade off and he would feel more himself again—only to start the cycle over again on Monday morning. Years after the show he observed Vulcan speech patterns, social attitudes, patterns of logic, and emotional suppression in his own behavior.|$|E

He quickly proved himself to be a child prodigy on the violin, and moved to Budapest with his father to study with the renowned pedagogue Jenő Hubay. After completing his studies with Hubay in his early teens, Szigeti began his international concert career. His performances at that time were primarily limited to salon-style recitals and the more overtly virtuosic repertoire; however, after making the acquaintance of pianist Ferruccio Busoni, he began to develop a much <b>more</b> <b>thoughtful</b> and intellectual approach to music that eventually earned him the nickname [...] "The Scholarly Virtuoso".|$|E
500|$|IGN's Matt Wales {{rated the}} episode 8 out of 10, {{and thought that}} [...] "even less {{actually}} happened" [...] than the previous episode, though he enjoyed the [...] "atmospheric build-up and <b>more</b> <b>thoughtful</b> tone". While he considered it predictable, {{he said that it}} [...] "still offered plenty in the way of entertainment with its brisk pace, beautifully-realised underground world and a convincing cast of rounded characters". He praised Smith and Gillan's performances in the ending, but thought it was [...] "a surprisingly downbeat denouement". Ian Berriman of SFX magazine gave [...] "Cold Blood" [...] four and a half out of five stars, positively comparing the emotional ending to episodes from the Russell T Davies era. He also had some [...] "nitpicks" [...] about the episode, such as the abrupt character change of Malohkeh.|$|E
500|$|Van Eyck {{had earlier}} portrayed Rolin in the c. 1435 Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, and the patron is {{recognizable}} from that work; both portraits show similar lips, a large chin and somewhat pointed ears. In van Eyck's portrait, Rolin {{is presented as}} perhaps pompous and arrogant; here– ten years later– he appears <b>more</b> <b>thoughtful</b> and concerned with humility. Campbell notes wryly that van der Weyden may {{have been able to}} disguise the sitter's ugliness and age, and that the unusual shape of his mouth may have been downplayed. He writes that while [...] "van Eyck impassively recorded, van der Weyden imposed a stylised and highly personal vision of the subject". Van Eyck's depiction was most likely the more accurate; van der Weyden embellished, mainly by lengthening the nose, enlarging the eyes and raising the eyebrows.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} delegates sought Adams' advice about forming new governments. While {{recognizing}} its importance, Adams had privately criticized Thomas Paine's 1776 pamphlet Common Sense, {{saying that the}} author had [...] "a better hand at pulling down than building." [...] Yet, some delegates found his views so convincing they urged him to commit them to paper. He did so in separate letters to these colleagues, each missive a bit longer and <b>more</b> <b>thoughtful.</b> So impressed was Richard Henry Lee that, with Adams's consent, he had the most comprehensive letter printed. Published anonymously just after mid-April 1776, it was titled simply Thoughts on Government and styled as [...] "a Letter from a Gentleman to his Friend." [...] Many historians agree that none of Adams' other compositions rivaled the enduring influence of this pamphlet.|$|E
500|$|In 1936 the {{magazine}} switched from untrimmed to trimmed edges; Brian Stableford comments {{that this was}} [...] "an important symbolic" [...] step, as the other sf pulps were still untrimmed, making Astounding smarter-looking than its competitors. [...] Tremaine was promoted to assistant editorial director in 1937. [...] His replacement as editor of Astounding was John W. Campbell, Jr.. [...] Campbell had made {{his name in the}} early 1930s as a writer, publishing space opera under his own name, and <b>more</b> <b>thoughtful</b> stories under the pseudonym [...] "Don A. Stuart". [...] He started working for Street & Smith in October 1937, so his initial editorial influence appeared in the issue dated December 1937. [...] The March 1938 issue was the first that was fully his responsibility. [...] In early 1938, Street & Smith abandoned its policy of having editors-in-chief, with the result that Tremaine was made redundant.

Church received the letter from Springsteen's after a show on August 19, 2012. In the note, Springsteen explained his and his family's love of the song and that he hoped to have their paths cross at some point. Church was surprised when receiving the note and said that [...] "it’s a long note, takes up the entire back page of this setlist for a show that lasted three hours and 47 minutes." ...|$|E

For example, the award winning Senegalese film Xala takes government corruption as its theme. Charlie Chaplin's film The Great Dictator was a brave and innovative parody, also on a political theme. Stories that are thousands of years old, such as Noah, have been re-interpreted in film, applying familiar literary devices such as allegory and personification with new techniques such as CGI to explore big themes such as [...] "human folly", good and evil, courage and despair, love, faith, and death themes that have been a main-stay of entertainment across all its forms.|$|E
