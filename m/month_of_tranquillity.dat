50|$|Although the Lords of the Congregation {{withdrew from}} Edinburgh to Stirling after the {{conclusion}} of the 'Leith Agreement,' it did not lead to six <b>months</b> <b>of</b> relative <b>tranquillity</b> until a parliament in January 1560. Instead, numbers of French troops arrived in support of the Regent. The Lords claimed that this was in contravention of an article of the Leith agreement that proscribed garrisons of soldiers in Edinburgh. However, French copies of the articles lack this specific item.As early as 28 August 1559, Guise made a public proclamation that she had not violated the truce and rumours that she had breached the appointment were the work of the Congregation. In respect of the sixth article of the agreement, the Duke, Huntly, and the Provost of Edinburgh, Lord Seton, could not persuade the town to allow the Catholic Mass in St Giles.|$|R

40|$|The UK has {{recently}} {{recognized the importance}} of tranquil spaces in the National Planning Policy Framework. This policy framework places considerable emphasis on sustainable development with the aim of making planning more streamlined, localized and less restrictive. Specifically it states that planning policies and decisions should aim to "identify and protect areas <b>of</b> <b>tranquillity</b> which have remained relatively undisturbed by noise and are prized for their recreational and amenity value for this reason". This is considered by some (e. g. National Park Authorities) to go beyond merely identifying quiet areas based on relatively low levels of mainly transportation noise, as the concept <b>of</b> <b>tranquillity</b> implies additionally a consideration of visual intrusion of man-made structures and buildings into an Otherwise perceived natural landscape. In the first instance this paper reports on applying a method for predicting the perceived <b>tranquillity</b> <b>of</b> a place and using this approach to classify the level <b>of</b> <b>tranquillity</b> in existing areas. It then seeks to determine the impact of a new build, by taking the example of the construction of wind turbines in the countryside. For this purpose; noise level measurements, photographs and jury assessments <b>of</b> <b>tranquillity</b> at a medium sized land based wind turbine were made. It was then possible to calculate the decrement of noise levels and visual prominence with distance {{in order to determine the}} improvement <b>of</b> <b>tranquillity</b> rating with increasing range. The point at which tranquillity was restored in the environment allowed the calculation of the position of the footprint boundary. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. N...|$|R

40|$|AbstractReferences to the {{subjective}} notion <b>of</b> <b>tranquillity</b> {{have long been}} extensively deployed in marketing literature and in planning policy in relation to both its promotion and its protection, particularly in protected areas. Whilst a liberal {{use of the term}} has ensued, a plethora <b>of</b> research interprets <b>tranquillity</b> primarily with noise, and where broader interpretations are progressed, traditional, directional questioning techniques are evident in attempts to understand tranquillity and quantify its features. Surprisingly, few enquiries have taken a broader, inductive approach to determining the range of stakeholders’ views and of these even fewer have engaged specifically with local residents and particularly those classed as hard-to-reach. Using these latter approaches, of the few and most recent studies conducted, the Broadly Engaging with Tranquillity project provides a replicable framework for determining and mapping tranquillity. An extensive community engagement process launched the study, using participatory principles from which stakeholders’ views were modelled using Geographical Information Systems. Results of this research are reported together with an interpretation of the models created according to four distinct groups representing views of institutions and members of the public. Similar views are identified amongst the groups with tranquillity commonly related to natural environments, whereas nontranquillity was primarily equated to seeing and hearing people and the products of human activity. Yet distinctions are identified between the four groups that have important implications for who should be involved in determining local characteristics <b>of</b> <b>tranquillity</b> and for how protected area managers might include nonexpert views in their understanding and conservation <b>of</b> <b>tranquillity...</b>|$|R
