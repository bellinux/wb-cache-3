5|$|Aegaeon– Featured in Ascension, Aegaeon the Hecatonchires had pledged a blood oath to Zeus, {{but later}} betrayed the god. The first {{victim of the}} Furies, they {{captured}} and tortured the multi-armed creature. Instead of killing him, the Furies turned him to stone, making him the giant Prison of the Damned and becoming a symbol to all who <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> breaking a blood oath to a god. As Kratos attempted to escape the prison, Megaera used her parasitic insects to bring Aegaeon to life and control him as his many arms mutated into monstrous forms and began to attack the Spartan. Fending off two of its parasite-controlled arms, Megaera then infected Aegaeon's head, which attacked Kratos, but the Spartan outsmarted and killed Megaera; this also caused Aegaeon to die, freeing him from his suffering.|$|E
5|$|Some poetry {{types are}} {{specific}} to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition, playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm. In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of {{abstract}} algebra, since the positive real numbers form a subgroup of the complex numbers under multiplication, equation (4) implies that we <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> absolute value as an endomorphism of the multiplicative group of the complex numbers.|$|E

But thou camest not {{in at the}} wicket-gate that is at {{the head}} of this way; thou camest in hither through that same crooked lane, and therefore, I fear, however thou <b>mayest</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> thyself, when the {{reckoning}} day shall come, thou wilt have laid to thy charge that thou art a thief and a robber, instead of getting admittance into the city.|$|R
25|$|In addition, {{there are}} a number of earlier towers in Guernsey (the Guernsey {{loophole}} towers), that many people refer to as Martello towers, though they are not Martellos. They were built in the late 18th century, i.e., before the Martellos, and differ from them in a number of ways. One <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> them as precursors, like the Genoese towers they resemble.|$|E
25|$|Social action models {{help explain}} Social Outcomes because of basic sociological ideas {{such as the}} Looking Glass Self. The idea of Cooley's looking glass self is that our sense of self {{develops}} as we observe and reflect upon others and what they <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> our actions. Additionally, impression formation processes allow us to interpret the significance of others' actions.|$|E
25|$|These {{three key}} {{concepts}} – locality, realism, freedom– are highly technical and much debated. In particular, {{the concept of}} realism is now somewhat different {{from what it was}} in discussions in the 1930s. It is more precisely called counterfactual definiteness; it means that we <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> outcomes of measurements that were not actually performed as being just as much part of reality as those that were made. Locality is short for local relativistic causality. (Currently accepted quantum field theories are local in the terminology of the Lagrangian formalism and axiomatic approach.) Freedom refers to the physical possibility of determining settings on measurement devices independently of the internal state of the physical system being measured.|$|E

500|$|Marshall and Nichols {{discovered}} that the electromagnetic isotope separation process would require [...] of copper, which was in desperately short supply. However, silver could be substituted, in an 11:10 ratio. On 3 August 1942, Nichols met with Under Secretary of the Treasury Daniel W. Bell and asked for the transfer of 6,000 tons of silver bullion from the West Point Bullion Depository.

500|$|The song's final choruses {{include the}} line [...] "You <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Sexy Sadie, {{let her in}} through your front door", reprising the late-period Beatles device of self-reference. In this case, Harrison name-checks [...] "Sexy Sadie", John Lennon's thinly veiled attack on the Maharishi and the latter's alleged sexual {{advances}} towards one of the female students at the Rishikesh retreat. Inglis views this mention in [...] "Simply Shady" [...] as significant on three levels: Harrison is alluding to a casual sexual partner in the present; recalling his former mentor and guru, the Maharishi; and supplying [...] "a coded reference" [...] to his past as a Beatle.|$|E
500|$|Satin himself became {{increasingly}} {{critical of the}} Greens. [...] He gave a featured speech at the U.S. Green gathering in 1987 urging them to avoid hyper-detailed platform writing and other projects and specialize in one thing– running people for office who endorse the Ten Key Values. [...] But the speech failed to persuade. [...] After the Green gathering in 1989, he urged them to abandon hippie-era fears of money, authority, and leadership. [...] After the 1990 gathering he complained [...] "I've been Pure before," [...] an allusion to {{his time in the}} New World Alliance. [...] According to Greta Gaard, he then bid farewell to the Greens, but recognized it as a loss: [...] "Whatever I <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> their internal battles and political prospects, the Greens are My People. [...] Their life choices are my life choices; their failings mirror my own." [...] Within a year of voicing those words, he stopped New Options Newsletter and applied to law school.|$|E

500|$|The defence's {{witnesses}} {{included some}} of those who had cared for Elizabeth Parsons and who presumably still believed that the ghost was real. [...] Other witnesses included the carpenter responsible for removing the wainscotting from Parsons' apartment and Catherine Friend, who to escape the knocking noises had left the property. [...] One witness's testimony caused the court to burst into laughter, at which she replied [...] "I assure you gentlemen, it is no laughing matter, whatever you <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it." [...] Thomas Broughton was also called, as was a priest surnamed Ross, one of those who had questioned the ghost. [...] Judge Murray asked him [...] "Whether he thought he had puzzled the Ghost, or the Ghost had puzzled him?" [...] John Moore was offered support by several esteemed gentlemen and presented Murray with a letter from Thomas Secker, Archbishop of Canterbury, who sought to intercede on his behalf. [...] Murray placed the letter in his pocket, unopened, and told the court [...] "it was impossible it could relate to the cause in question." [...] Richard James and Richard Parsons also received support from various witnesses, some of whom although acknowledging Parsons' drink problem, told the court they could not believe he was guilty.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive reviews. Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune {{gave the}} song a positive review, {{calling it a}} [...] "club banger". Thomas Gonlianpoulous of Spin commended Swizz Beatz' [...] "bombastic production", Wayne's [...] "energetic yet nonsensical rap", and Brown's [...] "joyful, brisk vocals." [...] Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said the song, serving as lead single, says [...] "Brown's promise {{for the future is}} to be an altogether more interesting kind of RB& artist." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly referred to the song as a [...] "swaggering" [...] lead single. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times referred to the song as a type that he has made his specialty, and called it an [...] "electric, brassy collaboration." [...] Although Nick Levine of Digital Spy called the song [...] "a brutal, tuneless hunk of industrial R - as musically ugly as something like 'With You' was pretty", he said [...] "for that matter, this track rocks", commenting [...] "Whatever you <b>may</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him, you can't deny that Chris Brown lacks balls."
