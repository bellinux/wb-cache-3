Late in 1861, he proposed to Lincoln through an intermediary that the president provide him with advance information as to its policies, in exchange for friendly coverage in the Tribune.

500|$|Boyd met Harrison {{during the}} filming of The Beatles' A Hard Day's Night in 1964. [...] She was cast as a schoolgirl in that film. Her only line in the film was asking [...] "Prisoners?", but she later {{appeared}} in the [...] "I Should Have Known Better" [...] segment. Boyd was in a serious relationship with photographer Eric Swayne during this time, and so declined a date proposal from Harrison. Several days later, after ending her relationship with Swayne, {{she went back to}} work on the film, and Harrison asked her out on a date for a second time; she said [...] "yes". The couple went to a private gentlemen's club called the Garrick Club, chaperoned by the Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein. According to Boyd {{one of the first things}} Harrison said to her on the film set was: [...] "Will you marry me? Well, if you won't marry <b>me,</b> <b>will</b> you have dinner with me tonight?" ...|$|E
500|$|On December 2, 2010, Hayes {{apologized for}} the pain and {{suffering}} he had caused the Petit family and added that: [...] "Death for <b>me</b> <b>will</b> be a welcome relief and I hope it will bring some peace and comfort to those who I have hurt so much." [...] Judge Jon Blue formally imposed six death sentences, one for each of the capital charges; Blue then added a sentence of 106 years for other crimes Hayes committed during the home invasion, including kidnapping, burglary, and assault, before finishing with, [...] "This is a terrible sentence, but is, in truth, a sentence you wrote for yourself in flames. May God have mercy on your soul." [...] The judge also gave Hayes an official execution date of May 27, 2011; Blue said that this date was a formality, because if Hayes appealed his case, his execution could be delayed for decades. His death sentence became a life sentence in August 2015 when the state abolished the death penalty.|$|E

500|$|There was initial {{concern over}} Reeve's stamina for {{shooting}} the scenes, as his particular scene with Welling was six pages long, which translated to approximately twelve {{hours of work}} day. Beeman tried to design everything so it was as simple as possible, but Reeve quickly readjusted the scene. Beeman originally had Welling walk into frame and {{stand in front of}} Reeve, and then make a single move behind Reeve. Beeman was told, by Reeve, the scene needed more dynamic between the characters, and if Welling only made a single move, the dynamic would be lost. According to Reeve, [...] "Tom moving around <b>me</b> <b>will</b> hide the fact that I'm unable to move." [...] Beeman's fear of overstretching Reeve's stamina, because of the added shots to the scene, were put to rest when Reeve himself stated it did not matter how long it took to finish the scene, as long as it turned out great. Reeve was directing Yankee Irving when Smallville was gearing up to film the fourth season opener. As a result, Reeve could not reprise his role as Dr. Swann, which was the intention.|$|E
500|$|On 22 May 1911 Mahler {{was buried}} in the Grinzing {{cemetery}} (...) , as he had requested, under a tombstone inscribed only with his name because [...] "any who come to look for <b>me</b> <b>will</b> know who I was and the rest don't need to know." [...] Alma, on doctors' orders, was absent, but among the mourners at a relatively pomp-free funeral were Arnold Schoenberg (whose wreath described Mahler as [...] "the holy Gustav Mahler"), Bruno Walter, Alfred Roller, the Secessionist painter Gustav Klimt, and representatives from many of the great European opera houses. The New York Times, reporting Mahler's death, called him [...] "one of the towering musical figures of his day," [...] but discussed his symphonies mainly in terms of their duration, incidentally exaggerating the length of the Second Symphony to [...] "two hours and forty minutes." [...] In London, The Times obituary said his conducting was [...] "more accomplished than that of any man save Richter," [...] and that his symphonies were [...] "undoubtedly interesting in their union of modern orchestral richness with a melodic simplicity that often approached banality," [...] though it was too early to judge their ultimate worth.|$|E
500|$|Barry Walters from Rolling Stone {{mentioned}} that I'm Going to Tell You a Secret [...] "lacks the dishy delights of the diva's 1991 Truth or Dare doc. Instead, a more worldly Madge struggles {{to become a}} less sound-bite-reliant, more sincere person." [...] Darryl Sterdan from Jam! gave it three out of five stars, saying that [...] "it still sucks to sit through all that video and see almost as much of her limo as her show... For a start, how about giving us a [...] that isn't derivative and self-indulgent?" [...] Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide website opined that I'm Going to Tell You a Secret would find a divided audience and how one reacted to the documentary was a reflection of how one viewed Madonna. [...] "Fans like <b>me</b> <b>will</b> be able to essentially ignore the self-serving moments and enjoy the tour elements. We'll also like the glimpse behind the curtain at Madonna on the road," [...] he added. This view was shared by a reviewer from Lexington Herald-Leader who confessed {{that he did not}} enjoy the documentary except the live performances, since he saw Madonna only as an [...] "entertainer" [...] and not as a [...] "preacher".|$|E

500|$|While Leng {{considers}} that, lyrically and musically, [...] "Something" [...] reflects [...] "doubt and {{striving to}} attain an uncertain goal", author Ian Inglis writes of the confident statements that Harrison makes throughout regarding his feelings for Boyd. Referring to {{lines in the}} song's verses, Inglis writes: [...] "there is a clear and mutual confidence in the reciprocal nature of their love; he muses that [...] 'attracts me like no other lover' and 'all I {{have to do is}} think of her,' but he is equally aware that she feels the same, that 'somewhere in her smile, she knows.'" [...] Similarly, when Harrison sings in the middle eight that [...] "You're asking <b>me</b> <b>will</b> my love grow / I don't know, I don't know", Inglis interprets the words as [...] "not an indication of uncertainty, but a wry reflection that his love is already so complete that it may simply be impossible for it to become any greater". Richie Unterberger of AllMusic describes [...] "Something" [...] as [...] "an unabashedly straightforward and sentimental love song" [...] written at a time [...] "when most of the Beatles' songs were dealing with non-romantic topics or presenting cryptic and allusive lyrics even when they were writing about love".|$|E
500|$|Franck's text shows {{elements}} of early Pietism: {{the expression of}} extreme feelings, for example [...] "O seligste Zeiten!" [...] (O most blessed times) in the opening chorus, and a [...] "mystical demeanour", for example in the duet of the Soul and the Spirit united. In the middle section of the first movement, Franck paraphrases the Gospel text, which says in verse 23 that God wants to dwell with man, to [...] "" [...] (God Himself shall prepare our souls for His [...] temple, more literally: [...] "God wants to prepare [...] souls to become his temples"). The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John, [...] "" [...] (Whoever loves <b>Me</b> <b>will</b> keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him). Movement 3 addresses the Trinity and movement 4 the Spirit that {{was present at the}} Creation. Movement 5 is a duet of the Soul and the Spirit, underlined by an instrumental quote from Martin Luther's Pentecost hymn [...] "", which is based on the Latin hymn [...] "Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium". Movement 6 is a chorale, verse four of Philipp Nicolai's hymn [...] "". Nicolai's [...] "Geistlich Brautlied" [...] (Spiritual bridal song) continues the theme of unity between Soul and Spirit.|$|E
500|$|Like the {{original}} release, The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition received positive reviews from critics. Sean Ely of GamePro praised its updated audio, {{and said that}} the new graphics [...] "blow the old clunker visuals ... out of the water". He cited its script, humor, plot, puzzles and balanced difficulty level as high points, and finished, [...] "The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition is impressive, hilarious and downright worth your money." [...] Daemon Hatfield of IGN wrote, [...] "Almost 20 years after its release, [...] remains a blast to play." [...] He called the new graphics [...] "slick, if a little generic", and noted that the [...] "original graphics have a certain charm to them that the fancy pants new visuals just don't." [...] However, he enjoyed the redone music, the new hint function, and the added sound effects and voice acting. He summarized it as [...] "one of the best times you'll ever have pointing and clicking", and noted that [...] "few games are this funny." [...] Justin Calvert of GameSpot noted that [...] "the Special Edition looks much better and {{is the only way to}} play if you want to hear ... what characters are saying, whereas {{the original}} game's interface is less clunky." [...] However, he wrote that [...] "the voice work is such a great addition to the game that it's difficult to go back to the original edition." [...] He praised its humor, writing, puzzles and characters, and he believed that it had aged well. Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead wrote, [...] "Purists like <b>me</b> <b>will</b> almost certainly find something to grumble about over the span of the game, but the overall impact of the redesign is undeniably for the better." [...] However, he preferred the original game's Guybrush design, and believed that the new control system was [...] "rather less intuitive" [...] than the old one. He finished by stating that [...] "few games can stand the test of time with such confidence".|$|E

In March 2008, Barnes appeared as a special guest during soul singer Guy Sebastian's tour.|$|E
2500|$|The prosody and {{grammar of}} Plautus and Terence differ {{slightly}} {{from that of}} later poets such as Virgil and Ovid, {{and they tend to}} follow the rhythms of spoken Latin rather than literary rules.
