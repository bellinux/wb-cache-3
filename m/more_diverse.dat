5|$|Since the {{publication}} of From Bakunin to Lacan in 2001, {{there have been several}} attempts to develop an account of postanarchism that, while retaining many of Newman's specific conceptions of the anarchistic qualities of radical post-structuralist thought, would take postanarchist theory beyond academic discourse and into broader and <b>more</b> <b>diverse</b> environments, as the originator of postanarchism, Hakim Bey, had intended.|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} to quantify patterns of morphological diversity to enhance our understanding of variation in ecological and evolutionary traits. Here, we present a quantitative analysis of morphological diversity {{in a family of}} small mammals, the tenrecs (Afrosoricida, Tenrecidae). Tenrecs are often cited as an example of an exceptionally morphologically diverse group. However, this assumption has not been tested quantitatively. We use geometric morphometric analyses of skull shape to test whether tenrecs are <b>more</b> morphologically <b>diverse</b> than their closest relatives, the golden moles (Afrosoricida, Chrysochloridae). Tenrecs occupy a wider range of ecological niches than golden moles so we predict that they will be <b>more</b> morphologically <b>diverse.</b> Contrary to our expectations, we find that tenrec skulls are only <b>more</b> morphologically <b>diverse</b> than golden moles when measured in lateral view. Furthermore, similarities among the species-rich Microgale tenrec genus appear to mask higher morphological diversity {{in the rest of the}} family. These results reveal new insights into the morphological diversity of tenrecs and highlight the importance of using quantitative methods to test qualitative assumptions about patterns of morphological diversity...|$|R
