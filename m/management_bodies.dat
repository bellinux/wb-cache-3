25|$|According to The Economist findings, Berlusconi, while Prime Minister of Italy, {{retained}} in effective control of 90% of all national television broadcasting. This figure included stations he owns directly {{as well as}} those over which he had indirect control by dint of his position as Prime Minister and his ability to influence the choice of the <b>management</b> <b>bodies</b> of these stations. The Economist has also claimed that the Italian Prime Minister is corrupt and self-serving. A key journalist for The Economist, David Lane, has set out many of these charges in his book Berlusconi's Shadow.|$|E

Subsequently, Jat Airways changed its name to Air Serbia and everything else was kept unchanged, continuing to be a joint stock company, the commercial entity registered in the APR, and with all the rights and obligations of Jat Airways. At that moment, Jat Airways was working at full power and fulfilling the obligations of regular and charted passenger transportation, as agreed in its business plan for 2013.|$|E
25|$|American {{efforts to}} promote {{democracy}} {{in the region are}} generally characterized by top-down and bottom-up democratization strategies, which can be pursued simultaneously. The former top-down approach involves putting rhetorical and diplomatic pressure on regimes to reform and can {{go so far as to}} involve direct American military engagement installing democratic government (as is the case in Iraq following the 2003 invasion). The U.S. government generally pursues the latter bottom-up approach by funding international organizations that help strengthen the bases for gradual democratic transition (the rule of law, accountable government institutions and expanded political competition) in the MENA region by offering technical assistance and training to political parties and electoral <b>management</b> <b>bodies,</b> engaging with civil society, producing assessments and polls, and promoting female political participation. Some have criticized American democracy promotion in MENA for ineffectiveness, a lack of consistency, taking a one-size-fits-all approach and using democracy to justify military intervention abroad. Moreover, It's said that US democracy promotion had been accompanied by heavy costs for US and considerable damage to the target countries.|$|E

40|$|South Africa, {{influenced}} by global trends towards good governance and sustainable natural resource management, {{has begun to}} adopt a participatory management approach to state-owned indigenous forests. This study, in a remote communal area and State Forest in the Eastern Cape, sought to {{understand the importance of}} forest products to local users, together with the relationships between key stakeholders and institutions involved in use and management of State Forest resources. The importance of the Reserve in local peoples' livelihood strategies was clearly revealed but, {{in the absence of a}} functional, locally legitimate <b>management</b> <b>body,</b> the Reserve is being over exploited, with local villagers and outsiders capitalizing on low forest rents and lack of enforcement of rules. A de facto open access system is therefore in place. Intensive institution-building is necessary for any participatory management system to be successful, including provisions to: transfer power to the community <b>management</b> <b>body</b> clearly and without ambiguity - if necessary, providing a role within it for the traditional leadership; provide the community <b>management</b> <b>body</b> with adequate financial and other resources; assist the community <b>management</b> <b>body</b> to draw up management plans; propagate and enforce regulations; and support the <b>management</b> <b>body</b> to enable it to provide effective, acceptable monitoring of forest use and regulation...|$|R
