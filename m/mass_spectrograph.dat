25|$|In 1897, Thomson {{showed that}} cathode rays were {{composed}} of previously unknown negatively charged particles, which he calculated must have bodies {{much smaller than}} atoms and a very large value for their charge-to-mass ratio. Thomson is also credited with finding the first evidence for isotopes of a stable (non-radioactive) element in 1913, {{as part of his}} exploration into the composition of canal rays (positive ions). His experiments to determine the nature of positively charged particles, with Francis William Aston, were the first use of mass spectrometry and {{led to the development of}} the <b>mass</b> <b>spectrograph.</b>|$|E
25|$|Building {{from work}} by J. J. Thomson on the {{deflection}} of positively charged atoms by electric and magnetic fields, Francis Aston {{built the first}} <b>mass</b> <b>spectrograph</b> at the Cavendish Laboratory in 1919. His aim {{was to try to}} separate the two isotopes of neon, which he was able to easily do. Aston discovered that the masses of all the particles are whole numbers, called the whole number rule, that is, the masses of all the isotopes are whole number multiples of the mass of the hydrogen atom. Aston arbitrarily computed his masses relative to oxygen-16, which he took to have a mass of exactly 16. (Today the atomic mass unit (amu) is relative to carbon-12.) Ironically, the one exception to this rule was hydrogen itself, which had a mass value 1.008. The excess mass was small, but well outside experimental uncertainty. Aston and others quickly realized that the discrepancy was on account of the binding energy of atoms, that is, the mass of a number of hydrogen atoms bound into a single atom must be less than the sum of the masses of the separate hydrogen atoms. Additional work determined the nuclide binding energies. Aston's work on isotopes garnered him the 1922 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of isotopes in a large number of non-radioactive elements, and for his enunciation of the whole-number rule. Noting Aston's recent discovery of nuclear binding energy, in 1920 Arthur Eddington suggested that stars may obtain their energy by fusing hydrogen (protons) into helium and that the heavier elements may form in stars.|$|E

500|$|When his Guggenheim {{fellowship}} {{expired in}} September 1934, {{he returned to}} the United States, where he accepted an associate professorship at Harvard University. He started by building a new <b>mass</b> <b>spectrograph</b> that he had designed with at the Cavendish Laboratory. Working with J. Curry Street, he commenced work on a cyclotron. They had a design for a [...] cyclotron provided by Ernest Lawrence, but decided to build a [...] cyclotron instead.|$|E
500|$|Around this time, William Giauque and Herrick L. Johnston at the University of California {{discovered}} the stable isotopes of oxygen. Isotopes were {{not well understood}} at the time; James Chadwick would not discover the neutron until 1932. Two systems were in use for classifying them, based on chemical and physical properties. The latter was determined using the <b>mass</b> <b>spectrograph.</b> Since it was known that the atomic weight of [...] oxygen was almost exactly 16 times as heavy as hydrogen, Raymond Birge, and Donald Menzel hypothesized that hydrogen {{had more than one}} isotope as well. Based upon the difference between the results of the two methods, they predicted [...] that only one hydrogen atom in 4,500 was of the heavy isotope.|$|E

His work on isotopes also leads to his formulation of the Whole Number Rule, which is later used extensively in the development of nuclear energy.

The first {{is a system that}} {{possesses}} a specially shaped magnet output boundary to satisfy the double-focusing condition for a wide mass range. The focal plane is usually curved. The second system is one in which a parallel ion beam is generated before the magnet, forming a straight double-focusing line. By introducing a quadrupole lens doublet such that the ion beam may be deflected in the same direction through the electric and magnetic fields, the overall image magnification can be arbitrarily controlled and stigmatic focusing achieved for the median ray...|$|R

This is a {{departure}} from the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment, which used an admixture of beryllium fluoride in its salt to get beryllium's corrosion control and neutron-doubling effects. TA claims that LiF can dissolve more fuel per unit of salt, compensating for LiF's lack of neutron-doubling and higher melting point. An additional issue is that to minimize tritium production, the salt's ratio of lithium 7 should be enhanced. Currently, Lithium 7 is produced only in small amounts, for calibrating <b>mass</b> <b>spectrographs.</b> A single reactor will require quantities on the order of several metric tonnes.|$|R
2500|$|Early in mass {{spectrometry}} research {{the resolution of}} mass spectrometers did not allow for accurate mass determination. Francis William Aston won the Nobel prize in Chemistry in 1922. [...] "For his discovery, by means of his <b>mass</b> <b>spectrograph,</b> of isotopes, in {{a large number of}} non-radioactive elements, and for his enunciation of the Whole Number Rule." [...] In which he stated that all atoms (including isotopes) follow a whole-number rule [...] This implied that the masses of atoms were not on a scale but [...] could be expressed as integers. (In fact multiply charged ions were rare, so {{for the most part the}} ratio was whole as well.) There have been several suggestions (e.g. the unit thomson) to change the official {{mass spectrometry}} nomenclature [...] to be more internally consistent.|$|E
2500|$|In 1886, Eugen Goldstein {{observed}} rays in gas discharges under {{low pressure}} that traveled {{away from the}} anode and through channels in a perforated cathode, opposite to the direction of negatively charged cathode rays (which travel from cathode to anode). Goldstein called these positively charged anode rays [...] "Kanalstrahlen"; the standard translation of this term into English is [...] "canal rays". Wilhelm Wien found that strong electric or magnetic fields deflected the canal rays and, in 1899, constructed a device with perpendicular electric and magnetic fields that separated the positive rays according to their charge-to-mass ratio (Q/m). Wien found that the charge-to-mass ratio depended {{on the nature of}} the gas in the discharge tube. English scientist J.J. Thomson later improved on the work of Wien by reducing the pressure to create the <b>mass</b> <b>spectrograph.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Niels Bohr had {{theorized that}} only the {{uranium-235}} isotope was fissile, so {{the first step was}} to determine a means of separating it from the more abundant uranium-238. The NRL placed contracts with universities to study four different methods of isotope separation: gaseous diffusion, ultra centrifuge, <b>mass</b> <b>spectrograph,</b> and thermal diffusion. Thermal diffusion was not initially regarded as very promising, but Gunn was impressed by Philip Abelson's efforts on it. He recruited Abelson, who became a Navy employee in June 1941, and the Navy pressed ahead with thermal diffusion, constructing a pilot plant at Anacostia in June 1941. Gunn {{was a member of the}} Uranium Committee that coordinated the early Army, Navy and civilian research efforts, but as the Manhattan Project ramped up in 1942, the NRL effort became dwarfed and sidelined, and the NRL was no longer informed of the Army's progress.|$|E

This paper described preparation and isolation of anthocyanins from purple sweet potatoes (PSP) and the time-course of anthocyanin profiles treated with gallic, ferulic, or caffeic acids at 95  °C. The color appearance of PSPanthocyanins alone, or with gallic, ferulic, or caffeic acids was described after the 15  h of thermal treatment. The high resolution <b>mass</b> <b>spectrographs</b> of PSP anthocyanins were determined using UPLC-ESI-HRMS. The spatial interaction of peonidin 3 -O-(2 -O-β-D-glucopyranocyl-β-D-glucopyranoide) - 5 -O-β-D-glucopyranoside and gallic/ferulic/caffeic acids was illustrated by molecular dynamic simulation...|$|R
2500|$|In 1938, Ney began {{undergraduate}} {{studies at}} the University of Minnesota, where he became acquainted with Professor Alfred O. C. Nier, who was an expert in mass spectrometry. [...] Soon, Nier recruited him {{to work in the}} spectroscopy laboratory for 35 cents per hour. [...] In February 1940, Nier prepared a tiny but pure sample of Uranium-235, which he mailed to Columbia University, where John R. Dunning and his team proved that this isotope was responsible for nuclear fission, rather than the more abundant Uranium-238. [...] This finding was a crucial step {{in the development of the}} atomic bomb. [...] That summer, Ney and Robert Thompson prepared a larger sample of Uranium-235, which provided material for further important tests. [...] Later, he helped Nier design and test <b>mass</b> <b>spectrographs</b> that were replicated for extensive use in the Manhattan Project.|$|R
40|$|When Goldstein's {{report on}} the "positive light" (or {{what is known as}} "Kanalstrahlen", canal rays) in gas {{discharge}} tubes first appeared in 1886, Willy Wien had just finished his thesis at the Helmholtz Institute in Berlin. Eleven years later he performed his first experiments on canal rays and found that they consisted of inert, charged and neutral particles. The charged component in canal rays could be de ected using electric and magnetic fields, enabling Wien to roughly determine their mass-to-charge ratio. Improving vacuum conditions and detection efficiency, Thomson finally resolved the lightest constituents of canal rays: the hydrogen ions H+ and H 2 +. This marked the beginning of mass spectrometry. The first <b>mass</b> <b>spectrographs</b> were parabola-image instruments being used by Thomson to discover isotopes. Until about 1923, canal rays became the most common ion source. Also Aston used canal rays as an ion source for the first double focussing mass spectrometer. - Wien continued his work on canal rays up {{to the end of his}} life (he died in 1928). He investigated their interaction with matter, i. e. the mean free path of canal rays in gases with respect to charge exchange and atomic excitation. His particular interest was addressed to the physics of light emission by canal rays, such as the line spectrum and the splitting of these lines in magnetic and electric fields, the Doppler effect and lifetimes...|$|R
2500|$|The word {{spectrograph}} {{had become}} part of the international scientific vocabulary by 1884. Early spectrometry devices that measured the mass-to-charge ratio of ions were called mass spectrographs which consisted of instruments that recorded a spectrum of mass values on a photographic plate. A mass spectroscope is similar to a <b>mass</b> <b>spectrograph</b> except that the beam of ions is directed onto a phosphor screen. A mass spectroscope configuration was [...] used in early instruments when it was desired that the effects of adjustments be quickly observed. Once the instrument was properly adjusted, a photographic plate was inserted and exposed. The term mass spectroscope continued to be used even though the direct illumination of a phosphor screen was replaced by indirect measurements with an oscilloscope. The use of the term mass spectroscopy is now discouraged due to the possibility of confusion with light spectroscopy. Mass spectrometry is often abbreviated as mass-spec or simply as MS.|$|E
2500|$|They indeed {{found the}} long carbon chains {{they were looking}} for, but also found an {{unexpected}} product that had 60 carbon atoms. [...] Over the course of 11 days, the team studied and determined its structure and named it buckminsterfullerene after noting its similarity to the geodesic domes for which the architect Buckminster Fuller was known. This discovery was {{based solely on the}} single prominent peak on the <b>mass</b> <b>spectrograph,</b> implying a chemically inert substance that was geometrically closed with no dangling bonds. Curl was responsible for determining the optimal conditions of the carbon vapor in the apparatus, and examining the spectrograph. [...] Curl noted that James R. Heath and Sean C. O'Brien deserve equal recognition in the work to Smalley and Kroto. [...] The existence of this type of molecule had earlier been theorized by others, but Curl and his colleagues were at the time unaware of this. [...] Later experiments confirmed their proposed structure, and the team moved on to synthesize endohedral fullerenes that had a metal atom inside the hollow carbon shell. [...] The fullerenes, a class of molecules of which buckminsterfullerene was the first member discovered, are now considered to have potential applications in nanomaterials and molecular scale electronics. Robert Curl's 1985 paper entitled [...] "C60: [...] Buckminsterfullerine", published with colleagues H. Kroto, J. R. Heath, S. C. O’Brien, [...] and R. E. Smalley, was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, presented to Rice University in 2015. The discovery of fullerenes was recognized in 2010 by the designation of a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society at the Richard E.

40|$|The POLAR {{satellite}} often observes upflowing ionospheric ions (UFIs) in {{and near}} the aurora] oval on southern perigee (approx. 5000 km altitude) passes. We present the UFI features observed by the thermal ion dynamics experiment (TIDE) and the toroidal imaging <b>mass</b> angle <b>spectrograph</b> (TIMAS) in the dusk-dawn sector under two different geomagnetic activity conditions in order to elicit their relationships with auroral forms, wave emissions, and convection pattern from additional POLAR instruments. During the active interval, the ultraviolet imager (UVI) observed a bright discrete aurora on the duskside after the substorm onset and then observed a small isolated aurora form and diffuse auroras on the dawnside during the recovery phase. The UFIs showed clear conic distributions when the plasma wave instrument (PWI) detected strong broadband wave emissions below approx. 10 kHz, while no significant auroral activities were observed by UVI. At higher latitudes, the low-energy UFI conics gradually changed to the polar wind component with decreasing intensity of the broadband emissions. V-shaped auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) signatures observed above - 200 kHz by PWI coincided with the region where the discrete aurora and the UFI beams were detected. The latitude of these features was {{lower than that of}} the UFI conics. During the observations of the UFI beams and conics, the lower-frequency fluctuations observed by the electric field instrument were also enhanced, and the convection directions exhibited large fluctuations. It is evident that large electrostatic potential drops produced the precipitating electrons and discrete auroras, the UFI beams, and the AKR, which is also supported by the energetic plasma data from HYDRA. Since the intense broadband emissions were also observed with the UFIs, the ionospheric ions could be energized transversely before or during the parallel acceleration due to the potential drops...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{summarize}} {{the activities of the}} Analytical Chemistry Laboratory (ACL) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) for Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 (October 1993 through September 1994). This annual report is the eleventh for the ACL and describes continuing effort on projects, work on new projects, and contributions of the ACL staff to various programs at ANL. The Analytical Chemistry Laboratory is a full-cost-recovery service center, with the primary mission of providing a broad range of analytical chemistry support services to the scientific and engineering programs at ANL. The ACL also has a research program in analytical chemistry, conducts instrumental and methods development, and provides analytical services for governmental, educational, and industrial organizations. The ACL handles a wide range of analytical problems. Some routine or standard analyses are done, but it is common for the Argonne programs to generate unique problems that require significant development of methods and adaption of techniques to obtain useful analytical data. The ACL has four technical groups [...] Chemical Analysis, Instrumental Analysis, Organic Analysis, and Environmental Analysis [...] which together include about 45 technical staff members. Talents and interests of staff members cross the group lines, as do many projects within the ACL. The Chemical Analysis Group uses wet- chemical and instrumental methods for elemental, compositional, and isotopic determinations in solid, liquid, and gaseous samples and provides specialized analytical services. Major instruments in this group include an ion chromatograph (IC), an inductively coupled plasma/atomic emission spectrometer (ICP/AES), spectrophotometers, mass spectrometers (including gas-analysis and thermal-ionization <b>mass</b> spectrometers), emission <b>spectrographs,</b> autotitrators, sulfur and carbon determinators, and a kinetic phosphorescence uranium analyzer...|$|R
