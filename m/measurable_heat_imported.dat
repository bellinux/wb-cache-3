Coastal groundwater discharge, including submarine groundwater discharge, may provide stabilizing conditions for intertidal zone permeable sediments. In this study, we integrated detailed time series temperature observations, porewater pressure measurements, and two-dimensional electrical resistivity tomography profiles {{to understand the}} coupled hydraulic-thermal regime of a tropical sandy intertidal zone in a fringing coral reef lagoon (Rarotonga, Cook Islands). We found three heating patterns across the 15 m study transect over tidal and diel periods: (1) a highly variable thermal regime dominated by swash infiltration and changes in saturation state in the upper foreshore with net <b>heat</b> <b>import</b> into the sediment, (2) a groundwater-supported underground stable, cool region just seaward of the intertidal slope break also <b>importing</b> <b>heat</b> into the subsurface, and (3) a zone of seawater recirculation that sustained consistently warm subsurface temperatures that exported heat across the sediment-water interface. Simple calculations suggested thermal conduction as the main heat transport mechanism for the shallow intertidal sediment, but deeper and/or multi-dimensional groundwater flow was required to explain temperature patterns beyond 20 cm depth. Temperature differences between the distinct hydrodynamic zones of the foreshore site resulted in significant thermal gradients that persisted beyond tidal and diel periods. The thermal buffering of intertidal zones by coastal groundwater systems, both at surface seeps and in the shallow subsurface, can be responsible for thermal refugia for some coastal organisms and hotspots for biogeochemical reactions...|$|R

A {{description of the}} surface was given using non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and transport coefficients were determined. Three independent coefficients were found for the whole surface: the resistance to heat transfer, the coupling coefficient and the resistance to mass transfer. These coefficients were defined in stationary state. All resistances are significant, and show that the surface acts {{as a barrier to}} transport. A new scheme was devised to find the enthalpy of adsorption, from two particular coupling coefficients, namely the <b>measurable</b> <b>heats</b> of transfer. The method yields the enthalpy of adsorption {{as a function of the}} excess surface concentration and surface temperature, but in this case it is nearly constant, 55 kJ/ mol. An expression of the surface permeability is given and our results are in agreement with experimental observations. A further inspection of the surface regarded as a series of two resistances, showed that the gas side of the surface dominates completely the resistance to heat transfer, while the silicalite side determines the resistance to mass transfer and the value of the coupling coefficient. The coefficients were not sensitive to the surface structure, whether it was flat, or zig-zag textured. Interestingly, the surface excess concentration was negative for low pressures, underlining the importance of the surface as a barrier to transport.

Precise recording of human eye movements. Vision Res 1975; 15 (3) : 447 - 50], which suffer from the instability of pupil size, blinking behavior and lower temporal resolution. However, no conventional {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) -compatible search-coil eye tracker exists. The main problems for such a technique are the interaction between the transmitter coils and the magnetic gradients used for imaging as well as the limited amount of space in a scanner.

The system described has a spatial resolution of 0. 07 ° (visual angle) and a high temporal resolution (22 kHz). The transmitter coils are integrated into the visual presentation system and the control/analysis unit is portable, which enables us to integrate the eye tracker with an MRI scanner. Our tests demonstrate low noise in the recorded eye traces and scanning with minimal artifact. Furthermore, the induced current in the search coil caused by the RF pulses does not lead to <b>measurable</b> <b>heating.</b> Altogether, this MR-compatible search-coil eye tracker can be used to precisely monitor EMs with high spatial and temporal resolution during fMRI.

Because fiber-optic cables used for DTS are typically sheathed in dark UV-resistant materials, the question arises as to how shortwave solar radiation penetrating a water column influences the accuracy of absolute DTS-derived temperatures in aquatic applications. To quantify these effects, we completed a modeling effort that accounts {{for the effects of}} radiation and convection on a submersed cable to predict when solar heating may be important. Results indicate that for cables installed at shallow depths in clear, low-velocity water bodies, <b>measurable</b> <b>heating</b> of the cable is likely during peak solar radiation. However, at higher velocities, increased turbidity and/or greater depths, the effects of solar heating are immeasurable. A field study illustrated the effects of solar radiation by installing two types of fiber-optic cable at multiple water depths (from 0. 05 to 0. 8 m) in the center and along the sidewall of a trapezoidal canal. Thermistors were installed at similar depths and shielded from solar radiation to record absolute water temperatures. During peak radiation, thermistor data showed small temperature differences (∼ 0. 003 °C– 0. 04 °C) between depths suggesting minor thermal stratification in the canal center. DTS data from cables at these same depths show differences of 0. 01 °C– 0. 17 °C. The DTS differences cannot be explained by stratification alone and are likely evidence of additional heating from solar radiation. Sidewall thermistor strings also recorded stratification. However, corresponding DTS data suggested that bed conduction overwhelmed the effects of solar radiation...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{and mass}} {{transfers}} are coupled processes, also in nucleation. In principle, a nucleating cluster {{would have a}} different temperature compared to the surrounding supersaturated old phase because of the heat release involved with attaching molecules to the cluster. In turn a difference in temperature across the cluster surface is a driving force for the mass transfer {{to and from the}} cluster. This coupling of forces in nonisothermal nucleation is described using mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics, emphasizing <b>measurable</b> <b>heat</b> effects. An expression was obtained for the nonisothermal nucleation rate in a one-component system, in the case where a temperature difference exists between a cluster distribution and the condensed phase. The temperature is chosen {{as a function of the}} cluster size only, while the temperature of the condensed phase is held constant by a bath. The generally accepted expression for isothermal stationary nucleation is contained as a limiting case of the nonisothermal stationary nucleation rate. The equations for heat and mass transport were solved for stationary nucleation with the given cluster distribution and with the temperature controlled at the boundaries. A factor was defined for these conditions, determined by the heat conductivity of the surrounding phase and the phase transition enthalpy, to predict the deviation between isothermal and nonisothermal nucleation. For the stationary state described, the factor appears to give small deviations, even for primary nucleation of droplets in vapor, making the nonisothermal rate smaller than the isothermal one.

To save energy for the HVAC systems, it is critically important to firstly know the “load signatures ” of the HVAC system, i. e., the quantity of <b>heat</b> <b>imported</b> from the outdoor environments and by the passengers respectively in different periods of a day, which will significantly benefit the design of control policies. In this paper, we present a novel sensing and learning approach to identify the load signature of the HVAC system in the subway stations. In particular, sensors and smart meters were deployed to monitor the indoor, outdoor temperatures, and the energy consumptions of the HVAC system in real-time. The number of passengers was counted by the ticket checking system. At the same time, the cooling supply provided by the HVAC system was inferred via the energy consumption logs of the HVAC system. Since the indoor temperature variations are driven by the difference of the loads and the cooling supply, linear regression model was proposed for the load signature, whose coefficients are derived via a proposed algorithm. We collected real sensing data and energy log data from HaiDianHuangZhuang Subway station, which is in line 4 of Beijing from the duration of July 2012 to Sept. 2012.

The first time identifies a continental shelf area where seasonal thermal oscillation signal (amplitudes and phase) changes abruptly. In order to explain this anomaly, the second data set allows a description of thermal fluctuations in a wide range of frequencies and an estimation of the upstream heat budget of the Guadalquivir estuary. Results show that high frequency thermal signal, diurnal and semidiurnal, and water flux signal through Guadalquivir mouth, mainly semidiurnal, apparently interact randomly to give a small exchange of thermal energy at high frequency. There is no trace, at the estuary's mouth, of daily heat exchanges with intertidal mudflats probably because it tends to cancel on daily time scales. Results also show that fluctuations of estimated air-sea fluxes force fluctuations of temperature in a quite homogeneous estuarine, with a delay of 20 days. The along-channel thermal energy gradient reaches magnitudes of 300 - 400 J m- 4 near the mouth during the summer and winter and drives the estuary-shelf exchange of thermal energy at seasonal scale. Particularly, the thermal <b>heat</b> <b>imported</b> by the estuary from the shelf area during late fall-winter-early spring of 2008 / 2009 is balanced by the thermal heat that the estuary exports to the shelf area during late spring-summer of 2008.

The number of adsorbed CTAB molecules at saturation corresponds approximately to the number of negative elementary charges bound at the surface of the latices. The mixing enthalpy is the sum of demicellization and sorption enthalpies.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{study has been}} performed for mixtures of octyloxycyanobiphenyl (8 OCB) and nonyloxycyanobiphenyl (9 OCB) liquid crystals and nine of their mixtures by means of high-resolution adiabatic scanning calorimetry. The isotropic to nematic transitions are weakly first order with latent heat values in the range usually encountered for this transition in other liquid crystals. With the exception of pure 8 OCB, for which only an upper limit of 1. 8 J kg(- 1) for the latent heat could be established, finite latent heats have been obtained for the nematic to smectic-A transition of all the mixtures and of pure 9 OCB. The concentration dependence of their latent heats could be well fitted with a crossover function consistent with a mean-field free-energy expression that has a nonzero cubic term induced by the Halperin-Lubensky-Ma (HLM) coupling between the smectic-A order parameter and the orientational director fluctuations. Clearly first-order transitions with <b>measurable</b> latent <b>heats</b> are found for mole fractions of 9 OCB in the mixtures where the effective critical exponent for the specific-heat capacity has substantially lower values than the tricritical one (0. 5). This is qualitatively different from what has been observed so far in other liquid-crystal systems and yields strong experimental evidence from a calorimetric experiment for the HLM coupling between the smectic-A order parameter and the director orientation fluctuations. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The Laugaland field near Akureyri was {{the first}} {{geothermal}} source commercially developed. The Ytri-Tjarnir field followed. To obtain sufficient water flow, additional fields were developed at Botn in 1980, Glerárdalur 2 km SW of the town in 1981, and Þelamörk 10 km north of the town in 1992. Water temperature is generally 65 to 75 C but can drop to 45 C during hot summer days. The cost of geothermal production is, at 32 mill/kwh, higher than the Icelandic national average of 11, but slightly less {{than the cost of}} <b>imported</b> <b>heating</b> oil. There is diminishing excess capacity but there are known and untapped resources near the town. Furthermore, there have been proposals to reinject water to extend the life of the sources.|$|R
30|$|The weed is {{not only}} {{affecting}} water supply to cities and towns in Zimbabwe, but is also negatively affecting the livelihoods of people living close to the infested water bodies. These communities usually consist {{of the poor and}} vulnerable who have limited access to basic energy services. In most cases, they use wood and paraffin leading to deforestation, indoor pollution, and increased procurement costs. It is also worth noting that urban dwellers in Zimbabwe have also resorted to the traditional energy sources such as wood due to frequent electricity outages. The country’s sole utility, the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) generates about 60  % of the Country’s peak demand and imports power from South Africa, Mozambique and Democratic Republic of Congo in an attempt to address the shortfall [6]. Urban dwellers are also increasingly using Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) for their <b>heating</b> needs. <b>Imported</b> fuels are, however, beyond the reach of many. The rural people have virtually deforested their environs in search of energy sources. The briquetting of the biomass, especially the foliage which is normally left to waste or burnt in open fires, has the potential to fill the energy gap and ensure energy sustenance in rural communities located close to the infested water bodies.|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the possibility that}} whole cell currents are involved and possibly trigger the response of mammalian cells to heat shock. Heat-sensitive cells from a radiation-induced fibrosarcoma (RIF- 1) and heat-resistant variants (TR- 4, TR- 5) were heated at 45 degrees C for 3 - 30 min. We observed induction of voltage-dependent currents after heating in the heat-resistant cells. These currents decayed to nonmeasurable levels {{over a period of}} 6 h. In RIF- 1 cells, however, voltage-dependent currents were detectable during heating only; these currents then decayed rapidly. Tetraethylammonium (TEA) cations blocked the currents; changing the concentration of extracellular K+ modified the current-voltage (I-V) relationship. These currents, therefore, resulted from the activation of voltage-dependent K+ channels. Addition of TEA during heating sensitized TR- 4 cells to heat but had no effect on the heat response of the RIF- 1 cells. Continuous exposure of the RIF- 1 cells to 2 % (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 7 days induced the expression of additional functional, voltage-dependent K+ channels; these gave rise to currents that were <b>measurable</b> after <b>heating.</b> In parallel, these cells became heat resistant. Addition of TEA to DMSO-treated cells blocked channels and returned the heat response almost to the pre-DMSO levels. Our data show a correlation between heat resistance and expression of K+ channels. Because resistance to heat very likely relates to the heat shock response, our data suggest that activation of channels may be a very early event in initiation of the heat shock response...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we used non-equilibrium {{molecular}} dynamics (NEMD) to study non-equilibrium behaviors of two irreversible systems, both exposed to large temperature gradients. As modeling systems, {{we have chosen}} a simple chemical reaction, 2 F↔F 2, and a liquid-vapor interface of a Lenard-Jones spline fluid. The primary goal of this thesis is to investigate the nature of coupled transfer of heat and mass, and to obtain insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms, dynamic structure and properties of the non-equilibrium systems. Heat and mass transports are central in mechanical {{as well as in}} chemical engineering. In order to predict transport properties of such systems, we need to confirm that there is a sound basis for the relevant transport equations. For the purpose, NEMD simulations have been used to study both equilibrium and dynamical behavior of the systems. To model the chemical reaction, Stillinger and Weber’s two- and three-body potentials were used. In addition to the two-body potential, the three-body potential is needed in order to sufficiently represent the main features of the reaction. Suitable NEMD techniques with the efficient reaction model were developed to study the fluorine reaction, in both stationary equilibrium and non-equilibrium states. Large temperature gradients were imposed through the boundaries in the NEMD box. With the NEMD simulations, the usefulness and validity of the theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics (NET) have been investigated. The validity of the assumption of ’local equilibrium’ was tested for the chemical reaction in various temperature gradients. Furthermore, the quantitative definitions for the local ’chemical’ equilibrium were presented using the results from NEMD. The dynamic properties of the system are governed by the system’s entropy production. We gave the expression for the entropy production from NET to define the fluxes and forces in the system. Proper transport equations were presented for determination of the transport coefficients of the reacting system. Origins of transport properties, i. e. thermal diffusion coefficients (or Soret coefficient), heats of transfer, and Onsager coefficients, were discussed in a microscopic level. A dissipative or dynamic structure of the chemical reaction was displayed. In addition we studied a phase transition, i. e. coupled heat and mass transfer across a liquid-vapor interface of a one-component system. The NEMD simulations with a Lenard-Johns spline potential were performed in different thermodynamic environments, e. g. with temperature gradients or/and concentration gradients. In the first place of this work, we proofed the validity of the assumption of local equilibrium at the surface where heat and mass transfer simultaneously. We then developed new algorithms to independently determine all four interfacial transfer coefficients for the surface. In the framework of NET, two sets of force- flux equations were defined by using the <b>measurable</b> <b>heat</b> flux on the vapor side {{as well as on the}} liquid side. The aim of this work is to find the interfacial coupling (Onsager) coefficients along the liquid-vapor coexistence curve and to add a proof of the Onsager’s reciprocal relations (ORR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to test the validity of Onsager relations for a surface using NEMD. PhD i kjemiPhD in Chemistr...|$|R
40|$|This article {{deals with}} a {{computational}} assessment of 3 D viscous flow behind multiple rows of circular pin fins in coolant channels used in gas turbine systems. Unsteady oscillations and turbulent flow characteristics especially near the endwall surfaces generate the much needed heat transfer enhancement that is usually from the walls to the coolant fluid. The current study is about a comprehensive assessment of present day computational fluid dynamics solvers for the enhancement of wall to coolant heat transfer rates. The paper presents details regarding many flow characteristics, including particle streamlines, as well as total pressure, turbulent kinetic energy and hub heat transfer coefficient contours. The endwall fence placed upstream of the cylinder generates a <b>measurable</b> increase in <b>heat</b> transfer rates downstream of the cylinder. The paper also includes a number of suggested ways to enhance endwall heat transfer rates for use in gas turbine cooling configurations and total pressure improvements near the turbine hub endwall...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} 2 -year dataset collected {{with the}} Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) located near Fairbanks, Alaska (MLAT = 65. 4 ° N) is employed {{to identify and}} analyse 22 events of anomalous electron heating (AEH) in the auroral E region. The overall AEH occurrence probability is conservatively estimated to be 0. 3 % from nearly-continuous observations of the E region by PFISR, although it increases to 0. 7 – 0. 9 % in the dawn and dusk sectors where all AEH events were observed. The AEH occurrence variation with MLT is broadly {{consistent with those of}} events with high convection velocity (> 1000 m s − 1) or electron temperature (> 800 K), except for much smaller AEH probability and absence of AEH events near magnetic midnight. This suggests that high convection electric field by itself is necessary but not sufficient for <b>measurable</b> electron <b>heating</b> by two-stream plasma waves. The multi-point observations are utilised to investigate the fundamental dependence of the electron temperature on the convection electric field, focusing on the previously-proposed saturation effects at extreme electric fields. The AEH dataset was found to exhibit considerable scatter and, on average, similar rate of the electron temperature increase with the electric field up to 100 mV m − 1 as compared with previous studies. At higher (highest) electric fields, the electron temperatures are below the linear trend on average (within uncertainty). By employing a simple fluid model of AEH, it is demonstrated that some of this deviation from the linear trend may be due to a stronger vibrational cooling at very large temperatures and electric fields...|$|R
