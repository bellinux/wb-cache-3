40|$|This Note {{examines}} recent {{attempts to}} resolve over sixty years {{of criticism of}} the Warsaw Convention 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>liability</b> limits. Part I discusses the Warsaw Convention, the international community 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to expand the liability provisions of the Warsaw Convention, and judicial treatment of the Warsaw Convention 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>liability</b> limits in the United States. Part II describes recent proposals {{to resolve the issue}} of liability limits, including the IATA Intercarrier Agreement, the DOT 2 ̆ 7 s proposed conditions to the IATA Intercarrier Agreement, the EC Proposal on air carrier liability, and the ICAO 2 ̆ 7 s draft of a new international convention. Part III argues that the IATA Intercarrier Agreement does not eliminate the need to amend the Warsaw Convention 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>liability</b> provisions because contractual agreements such as the IATA Intercarrier Agreement cannot achieve the dual goals of uniform liability limits and systematic legal procedures foreseen by the Warsaw Convention 2 ̆ 7 s drafters.

40|$|The Warsaw Convention 1929, officially {{referred}} to as the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Transportation by Air, established and elaborated, as one of its major tenets, the principle of the air carrier 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>liability</b> for damage caused to passengers, baggage and goods, and also for damage caused by delay. The rules of the Warsaw Convention are being applied {{all over the world and}} have demonstrated their reliability and usefulness. The passenger knows that, wherever and whenever he flies, there is a certain degree of uniformity in the rules governing the carrier 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>liability,</b> while the carrier, being aware of the extent of his liability, can make arrangements to insure himself against possible losses. It is therefore appropriate to examine the nature and the development of the legal grounds on which the air carrier 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>liability</b> rests, and their impact on everyday practice. Chinese aviation law regulations need to be modernized to correspond with global developments in the industry. As a first target, the low limitation of air damage recovery needs change, and more detailed implementing regulations are needed to determine the extent and quantum of damages caused by air accident. China needs to unify limits on liability regarding international carriage with those existing in other countries. This will certainly benefit both the aviation and insurance industries. Apart from the problem of low limitation, another important task is to clarify the interpretation of Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention 1929 and the Montreal Convention 1999, which is crucial to international air carrier 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>liability</b> to passengers. This is the main purpose of the present dissertation. By suggesting that (1) China should interpret 2 ̆ 2 accident 2 ̆ 2 broadly to provide more, but reasonable protections to passengers; (2) China should adopt tripartite approach to interpret 2 ̆ 2 from embarking to disembarking 2 ̆ 2 to catch up with modem changes of civil aviation, and (3) China should not allow recovery for pure mental injuries but only to allow recovery of mental distress which flowing from a bodily injury to best serve the purpose of the Conventions.

Many {{commentators}} feel it has, {{as do many}} {{executives who}} feel that the liability "tax" discourages innovation and ultimately fails to promote safety. On the other hand, economists have ceaselessly pointed out that when one party is made liable for injury caused to another, an externality has been internalized. This symposium is intended to clarify just what economists know about the U. <b>S.</b> <b>liability</b> system: its worth {{as well as its}} flaws. The resulting picture is not a pretty one. Often liability is imposed on injurers as a means of compensating and insuring victims, despite the fact that such compensation and insurance could be accomplished much more effectively using direct accident insurance. Liability is an expensive means of providing compensation, since the legal liability system involves large transaction costs, mainly in the form of litigation expenses. Overall, America's institutions for assigning liability are poorly designed to promote economic efficiency. ...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{resource}} {{damage assessment}} (NRDA) {{is a central}} instrument in an environmental liability regime which aims at making the public whole again after a private entity has dam-aged the environment as a public good. One approach to assess the damage caused for example by an oil spill is to measure it in monetary terms using non-market valuation meth-ods. Looking at today’s NRDA rules reveals that a significant shift has taken place from an emphasis on monetary benefit estimates to non-monetary techniques, in particular to the habitat equivalence analysis. Are economists therefore becoming bystanders in natural re-source damage assessment? In today’s U. <b>S.</b> <b>liability</b> regime the use of non-market valuation methods is rather an exception. The same applies to the European liability regime that fol-lows {{to a large extent}} the U. S. rules when it comes to damages assessment. However, con-fining the application of economic valuation to the leftovers of non-monetary assessment techniques may rather prove to be a drawback with respect to the aim of making the public whole.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to reconsider the {{theoretical}} foundations of the liability of a principal to third parties in contract. In order to reconcile the extended liability of the principal for unpermitted contracts of his agent beyond traditional apparent authority, the treatise writers have created new generalized concepts. The conclusion of this study is that new conceptual generalizations to advance the theoretical framework of the law of principal 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>liability</b> in contract are not only unnecessary but misleading. The basis of this conclusion is that new concepts with more general and indeterminate content than the older ones seem to be created to rationalize the imposition of contract liability with little or no recognition of the primary rule that both contract and estoppel to deny contract in agency are based on manifestations of consent by the principal. A valid operational or functional analysis of the principal 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>liability</b> in contract in each case can be made by utilizing the traditional concepts of authority and estoppel. The structural elements of such a functional theory of agency contracts are suggested in this review of leading English and American decisions...|$|R

They thus affect the conditions under which parties will have incentives to engage in search. The dynamics of patent search are actually quite complicated.
