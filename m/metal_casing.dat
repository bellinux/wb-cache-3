5|$|Timmy and his fairies {{return to}} the Blue Moon via M.E.R.F.'s escape pod to {{retrieve}} the second wand. A weakened Turbo Thunder reveals the second wand only opens underneath a secret cave, which contains magical wands and the final part of the cave prophecy: to find the ice wand. The group returns to Fairy World with the wands to free the imprisoned fairies before everyone heads back to Earth. The fairies arrive and use their magic to remove the Earth's <b>metal</b> <b>casing.</b> Timmy heads into space with the Destructinator following him; the Destructinator attacks him, which sends him {{back down to the}} Earth, at its north polar region. After Timmy tricks the Destructinator into inhaling the explosives, he reveals that he stole the detonator remote from him back in space and uses it to obliterate him.|$|E
25|$|Ishii innovated bombs {{containing}} live {{mice and}} fleas, with very small explosive loads, {{to deliver the}} weaponized microbes, overcoming {{the problem of the}} explosive killing the infected animal and insect by the use of a ceramic, rather than <b>metal,</b> <b>casing</b> for the warhead. While no records survive of the actual usage of the ceramic shells, prototypes exist and are believed to have been used in experiments during WWII.|$|E
25|$|In 1997 the lithium polymer battery was {{released}} by Sony and Asahi Kasei. These batteries hold their electrolyte in a solid polymer composite instead of in a liquid solvent, and the electrodes and separators are laminated to each other. The latter difference allows the battery to be encased in a flexible wrapping instead of in a rigid <b>metal</b> <b>casing,</b> which means such batteries can be specifically shaped to fit a particular device. This advantage has favored lithium polymer batteries {{in the design of}} portable electronic devices such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants, and of radio-controlled aircraft, as such batteries allow for more flexible and compact design. They generally have a lower energy density than normal lithium-ion batteries.|$|E
2500|$|The {{bomb was}} {{designed}} by Soviet chemical engineer [...] (1903-1989) in 1942. Gelperin projected and built bombs with tiny <b>metal</b> <b>casings,</b> {{in order to reduce}} the use of iron cast and aluminium. In Gelperin developments, the <b>metal</b> <b>casings</b> represented only 35 percent of the bomb's weight.|$|R
50|$|In 1987, these {{buildings}} were gutted {{and the original}} aluminum-framed windows replaced with dark-brown <b>metal</b> <b>casings.</b> More study spaces and kitchens were added, and the capacity of each University Hall was reduced.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  3, noise {{reduction}} is improved by housing electrodes in box-shaped <b>metal</b> <b>casings.</b> The {{distance from the}} tip of each electrode to its dedicated amplifier is kept short at ~  10  cm, amplifiers are mounted inside the <b>metal</b> electrode <b>casings,</b> and those <b>metal</b> <b>casings</b> cover the entire region near the heart to act as noise shielding. Further, since electrodes are pushed into the interior of the housings with body contact, <b>metal</b> <b>casings</b> are drawn closer to the body-surface to increase noise shielding during measurement. Effective shielding has been demonstrated up to 71.92 μT, which is {{in the vicinity of the}} 60  Hz, 83.3 μT guideline value of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). Further, when measurements were made intentionally exposing the measurement platform to high amplitude electromagnetic radiation (noise), some noise effects were observable but large differences in measurement values between the high-noise and normal environment were not observed. Accordingly, noise shielding is sufficient to measure body-surface potential under normal (low radiation) conditions. In addition, electrode casings are joined in a ball-joint fashion allowing independent movement and rotation. Each electrode casing can incline independently to conform to the contour of the body making it easy to establish reliable contact with accurate electrode positioning.|$|R
25|$|Charangas supplanted the típica as the {{standard}} instrumental line-up for the danzón. Initially called charangas francesas (though {{they have nothing to}} do with France), they were 'invented' at the start of the 20th century. The formulation is still going strong, with appropriate adjustments to the instrumentation. The basic idea is to pitch the tone of the orchestra higher and brighter than the típica, by removing the brass, replacing the clarinet with a flute and replacing the kettle drums with a new invention, the pailas criollas, now called timbales. This metal-cased drum, hit with timbales sticks, and not timpani sticks, produces a distinctive effect. The two timbales drums are pitched differently, and may be supplemented with two timbalitos, pitched even higher, and one or two cencerros (cowbells). Also noteworthy is the use of the sticks on the <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> to produce a rhythm known as the cascara. From early on these bands also included a piano. The overall effect is to produce a lighter, brighter flavor to the music; who actually originated the idea is not known.|$|E
500|$|At about 10:30pm, just as Fielden was {{finishing}} his speech, police arrived en masse, marching in formation towards the speakers' wagon, {{and ordered the}} rally to disperse. Fielden insisted that the meeting was peaceful. Police Inspector John Bonfield proclaimed:I command you [...] {{in the name of}} the law to desist and you [...] to disperse. A home-made bomb with a brittle <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> filled with dynamite and ignited by a fuse was thrown into the path of the advancing police. Its fuse briefly sputtered, and then the bomb exploded, killing policeman Mathias J. Degan with flying metal fragments and mortally wounding six other officers.|$|E
500|$|When Blacker {{became aware}} of the {{existence}} of hollow-charge ammunition, he realized that it was exactly the kind of ammunition he was looking for to develop a hand-held anti-tank weapon, as it depended upon the energy contained within itself, and not the sheer velocity at which it was fired. Blacker then developed a hollow-charge bomb with a propellant charge in its tail, which fitted into a shoulder-fired launcher that consisted of a <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> containing a large spring and a spigot; the bomb was placed into a trough {{at the front of the}} casing, and when the trigger was pulled the spigot rammed into the tail of the bomb and fired it out of the casing and up to approximately [...] away. Blacker called the weapon the 'Baby Bombard', and presented it to the War Office in 1941. However, when the weapon was tested it proved to have a host of problems; a War Office report of June 1941 stated that the casing was flimsy and the spigot itself did not always fire when the trigger was pulled, and none of the bombs provided exploded upon contact with the target.|$|E
50|$|Regardless of the {{increasing}} weight and size, the devices continued to become larger to accommodate the increased bass output; newer boombox models were affixed with heavy <b>metal</b> <b>casings</b> to handle the vibrations from the bass.|$|R
50|$|There are {{approximately}} 1,000 such RTGs in Russia. All {{of them have}} long exhausted their 10-year engineered life spans. They are likely no longer functional, and may be in need of dismantling. Some of them have become the prey of metal hunters, who strip the RTGs' <b>metal</b> <b>casings,</b> regardless {{of the risk of}} radioactive contamination.|$|R
2500|$|In June 2016, it was {{revealed}} that the Iron Dome had been tested to successfully intercept salvos of artillery shells, which are typically difficult to destroy because of the need to penetrate the thickness of their <b>metal</b> <b>casings</b> to get to the warhead, and [...] "multiple" [...] air-to-ground precision guided munitions (PGMs) similar to the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM).|$|R
2500|$|Every shell {{used by the}} K 39 weighed [...] The {{original}} Czech 21cm Gr 39 (t) high-explosive shell {{had both}} nose and base fuzes and a filling of [...] of TNT. The German equivalent, the 21cm Gr 40 lacked the base fuze, had a copper driving band well forward on the shell and was fitted with a thin <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> behind the driving band filled with a graphite mixture intended as a bore lubricant and to reduce wear. The 21cm Gr 39 Be was a Czech-designed anti-concrete shell fitted with a base fuze, a ballistic cap and the additive sleeve. It was filled with [...] of TNT. There was also an armor-piercing, base-fuzed shell, the 21cm Pzgr 39 of which little is known other than it had a filling of [...] of a PETN/wax mixture.|$|E
2500|$|Specially {{manufactured}} flash drives {{are available}} {{that have a}} tough rubber or <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> designed to be waterproof and virtually [...] "unbreakable". These flash drives retain their memory after being submerged in water, and even through a machine wash. Leaving such a flash drive out to dry completely before allowing current to run through it {{has been known to}} result in a working drive with no future problems. Channel Five's Gadget Show cooked one of these flash drives with propane, froze it with dry ice, submerged it in various acidic liquids, ran over it with a jeep and fired it against a wall with a mortar. A company specializing in recovering lost data from computer drives managed to recover all the data on the drive. All data on the other removable storage devices tested, using optical or magnetic technologies, were destroyed.|$|E

50|$|When the Soviets left Naissaar {{in early}} 1993, they burned the {{explosives}} in the naval mines, leaving {{a multitude of}} <b>metal</b> <b>casings</b> scattered throughout the island. Many of these were scavenged as scrap iron, but a field of mines is still visible near the wharf at Mädasadam. Another legacy of the arms industry is that the soil of the island remains contaminated by oil and heavy metals.|$|R
50|$|Another {{danger is}} agent leakage. Army reports have {{indicated}} that nerve agent GB can corrode the <b>metal</b> <b>casings</b> of the munitions over time. As Sarin decomposes it forms acids which can corrode the aluminum casings found around the agent in the M55. M55 rockets containing GB have accounted {{for the majority of}} leaking American chemical weapons. In mid-2002, over 4,000 munitions in the U.S. chemical stockpile were found to be leaking agent; of that number 2,102 were Sarin containing M55s.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} the company are {{somewhat}} obscure. It appears it was organized in Los Angeles, California around 1907 by two brothers named Talbot and possibly a partner named T. A. Hays. Hays, a businessman with 21 years experience in the steel industry, was at some stage appointed Vice President of the new company, which in this period was a small-calibre steel pipe and <b>metal</b> <b>casings</b> manufacturer. An early President of the company was James A. Talbot, later to make and lose a fortune {{as the head of}} the Richfield Oil Company.|$|R

50|$|Several {{workshops}} {{soon began}} to produce Bornholm clocks which became popular as they were cheaper than the more authentic models produced elsewhere. There were probably about 30 different clockmakers in the town {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century. By the 1840s, some 2,000 clocks were made each year. Over the years, they were produced in various styles with both wooden and <b>metal</b> <b>casings.</b> The smaller pendulum clocks which were also produced became popular too. Around the end of the 19th century, production came to a halt as industrially produced clocks became far cheaper than Bornholm's handcrafted artefacts.|$|R
50|$|Boards {{afforded the}} {{opportunity}} for decorative ornamentation, with <b>metal</b> <b>casings</b> set into the wood for the installation of precious gems, stones, and jewels. The cover material would then be laid over the casings by hand and cut around {{the rim of the}} casings to reveal the jewels. The books typically bound were Gospels and other religious books made for use within the church. In the Middle Ages, the responsibility of creating adorned books went to metalworkers and guilders, not the bookbinders, who worked with sheets of gold, silver, or copper to create jewelled and enamelled panels that were nailed separately into the wooden boards.|$|R

5000|$|On Sept. 28, 1982, the Cedar Bayou plant {{received}} a letter from an anonymous person that ten bombs had been hidden within the plant. The sender of the letter threatened to detonate the bombs unless Gulf Oil paid $15 million. Gulf Oil shut down the Cedar Bayou plant after determining the letter was a legitimate threat. A search of the Cedar Bayou plant located five sophisticated bombs in <b>metal</b> <b>casings.</b> A federal and multi-state investigation led to the arrest of four people—John Marvin McBride; his common-law wife, Jill Renee Bird; Michael Allen Worth, and Theodore D.

40|$|State-of-the-art imaging {{technologies}} for monitoring {{the integrity of}} oil and gas well bores are typically limited to inspection of <b>metal</b> <b>casings</b> and cement bond interfaces close to the first casing region. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a novel well-integrity inspection system that is capable of providing enhanced information about the flaw structure and topology of hydrocarbon producing well bores. In order to achieve this, we propose the development of a multi-element electromagnetic (EM) inspection tool that can provide information about material loss in the first and second casing structure as well as information about eccentricity between multiple casing strings. Furthermore, the information gathered from the EM inspection tool will be combined with other imaging modalities (e. g. data from an x-ray backscatter imaging device). The independently acquired data are then fused to achieve enhanced accuracy compared to the sum of individual acquired data. A test rig composed of several concentric pipes was assembled and various defect structures in the <b>metal</b> <b>casings</b> were imaged. Initial test results were obtained with a scanning system that includes a transmitting coil and several receiving coils that are mounted on a single rod. A mechanical linear translation stage was used to move the EM sensors in the axial direction during data acquisition. For simplicity, a single sensor and repetitive scans were employed to simulate performance of a sensor array system. The resulting electromagnetic images enable the detection of metal defects that previously have been introduced into the steel pipes. Responses from several sensors were used to assess position and amount of material loss in the first and second metal pipe as well as magnitude of eccentricities between the two pipes. The results from EM measurements and x-ray backscatter simulations demonstrate that data fusion from several sensing modalities can provide an enhanced assessment of flaw structures in producing well bores and potentially allow for early detection of anomalies that if undetected might lead to catastrophic failures...|$|R
