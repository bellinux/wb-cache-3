40|$|Medical professionalism {{education}} {{is one of}} very important curriculum components in medical education. Development and improvement of the module of the <b>Block</b> <b>Medical</b> Professionalism are the bridge to yielding a good, capable and professional medical doctor. The development of the module can be conducted in various ways, {{one of which is}} by applying the method of role playing. Role playing method applied at <b>Block</b> <b>Medical</b> Professionalism of 2012 was compared to <b>Block</b> <b>Medical</b> Professionalism of 201 in which role playing was not applied This research aimed to assess if there was increase of the result score of the students’ final test, total number of passing students, and students’ self motivation to study individually. The study results showed a higher number of passing students in <b>medical</b> professionalism <b>block</b> of 2012 as compared to <b>medical</b> professionalism <b>block</b> of 2011 (83. 7 % vs 32. 2 %). There was a significant correlation between role playing and the mean score of the students’ final test (p< 0. 05) and with the number of passing students (p< 0. 05). Most student felt more motivated to learn medical professionalism (94. 55 %). Application of role playing method can improve the final test score, total number of passing students, and students’ self motivation to study medical professionalism of 2012...|$|R

FFPE specimens were sectioned at 5 um onto positively-charged glass slides and heated for approximately 60 [*]min at 60 °C. Slides were deparaffinized in three sequential baths of xylene for 3 [*]min each, transferred to three sequential baths of 100 % alcohol for 3 [*]min each, followed by three sequential baths of 95 % alcohol for 3 [*]min each and then rinsed for 5 [*]min in deionized (DI) water. Slides were then pretreated in Diva heat-induced epitope retrieval solution (Biocare Medical) diluted 1 : 10 in DI water and placed inside a pressurized decloaking chamber already filled with 500 [*]mL of DI water. For antigen retrieval, slides were incubated for 15 [*]min inside the decloaking chamber in which pressurized incubation {{reaches a maximum}} of 125 °C at 16 PSI for 30 [*]sec and then cooled for 15 [*]min down to 95 °C.
