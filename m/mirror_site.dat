40|$|A common {{method used}} to reduce {{document}} retrieval times {{is the use of}} content replication i. e., mirror servers. The mirror servers provide several alternate sites to download a specific document and were traditionally used to increase the availability of content. Recently, several studies focused on using multiple <b>mirror</b> <b>sites</b> to concurrently download portions of a document from a set of <b>mirror</b> <b>sites.</b> Following are some of the issues involved in using multiple <b>mirror</b> <b>sites</b> concurrently: (a) selection of the "best" mirror servers from the client, (b) coping with dynamic overloading of the network and servers, and (c) coping with faults. This paper briefly examines two existing schemes for concurrent downloading or parallel-access downloading, or paraloading as it is called. It proposes a third paraloading scheme called the Dynamic Parallel Access. The performance of this scheme is experimentally evaluated. Recommendations for further improvements are also discussed. 1...|$|R

40|$|Online {{collaboration}} and sharing {{is the central}} theme of many webbased services that create the so-called Web 2. 0 phenomena. Using the Internet as a computing platform, many Web 2. 0 applications set up <b>mirror</b> <b>sites</b> to provide large-scale availability and to achieve load balance. However, {{in the age of}} Web 2. 0, where every user is also a writer and publisher, the deployment of <b>mirror</b> <b>sites</b> makes consistency maintenance a Web scale problem. Traditional concurrency control methods (e. g. two phase lock, serialization, etc.) are not up to the task for several reasons. First, large network latency between <b>mirror</b> <b>sites</b> will make two phase locking a throughput bottleneck. Second, locking will block a large portion of concurrent operations, which makes it impossible to provide large-scale availability. On the other hand, most Web 2. 0 operations do not need strict serializability – it is not the intention of a user who is correcting a typo in a shared document to block another who is adding a comment, as long as consistency can still be achieved. Thus, in order to enable maximal online {{collaboration and}} sharing, we need a lock-free mechanism that can maintain consistency among <b>mirror</b> <b>sites</b> on the Web. In this paper, we propose a flexible and efficient method to achieve consistency maintenance in the Web 2. 0 world. Our experiments show its good performance improvement compared with existing methods based on distributed lock...|$|R
