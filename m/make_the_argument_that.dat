500|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, when Tillemont wrote his Histoire des Empereurs, {{it was no}} longer {{possible}} to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> Philip was a Christian [...] "ſans difficulté", [...] "without difficulty". And when Jean-Baptiste Louis Crévier wrote his L'Histoire des empereurs des Romains, jusqu'à Constantin in 1749, he affirmed the contrary, that Philip was not a Christian at all: [...] "...it is easy to judge what degree of credit ought to be given to this story of his penance; which, besides, is not fully and exactly related by any ancient author. To make out an account of it any way tolerable, they have been obliged to patch several evidences together, and to supply and alter the one by the other. The shortest and safest course is not to admit of a perplexed and ill supported narrative. We have no great temptation to torture history in order to claim such a Christian." ...|$|E
500|$|The FEPC made {{a series}} of {{unsuccessful}} attempts to convince the PTC management and the union leadership to change their stance and to allow promotions of black employees to non-menial jobs. The PTC eventually conceded that it would be willing {{to go along with the}} government's request and [...] "employ Negroes, provided they are acceptable to fellow-workers", but the PRTEU leadership, particularly Frank Carney, staunchly resisted. On November 17, 1943, the FEPC issued a directive requiring that PTC end its discriminatory employment practices and allow blacks to hold non-menial jobs. The directive also required the PTC to review all job applications from June 1941 and redress earlier employment abuses based on racial discrimination. The union immediately protested and requested a public hearing, which took place on December 8, 1943. At the hearing the union tried to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> hiring blacks who had applied for the non-menial positions since June 1941 but were denied would adversely affect the seniority rights of the presently employed white workers. Malcolm Ross rejected that argument, pointing out that the seniority rights only begin when an employee is actually hired for a particular job. On December 29, 1943, FEPC issued a second directive, reinforcing the first one.|$|E

2500|$|Nick Roman of Ricky.Org said: [...] "Once Upon a Time {{has dealt}} with LGBT romance before, but never with as much depth as we get here with “Ruby Slippers”. While you could <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> the show should be {{focusing}} more on the Hades story at this late stage of the season rather than a one-off story about Ruby's romance with Dorothy.

2500|$|A further {{publication}} by Jantz {{based on}} Gravlee et al. claims that Boas had cherry picked {{two groups of}} immigrants (Sicilians and Hebrews) which had varied most towards the same mean, and discarded other groups which had varied in the opposite direction. He commented, [...] "Using the recent reanalysis by Gravlee et al. (2003), we can observe in Figure 2 that the maximum difference in cranial index due to immigration (in Hebrews) is {{much smaller than the}} maximum ethnic difference, between Sicilians and Bohemians. It shows that long headed parents produce long headed offspring and vice versa. To <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> children of immigrants converge onto an [...] "American type" [...] required Boas to use the two groups that changed the most." ...|$|E

5000|$|In addition, Regan {{rejects the}} idea of contractarianism, as he <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> {{children}} are [...] "unable to sign contracts and lack rights". Similarly, animals {{do not have the}} capacity to sign contracts, so why should children have an advantage over animals? Furthermore, he <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> if he were to approach animal rights through a contractarianism, when somebody kicks your dog, it is morally wrong because it upsets you but not the dog. Intuitively, this does not make sense, and contractarianism can be dismissed. His argument against utilitarianism is a bit more complicated.|$|R
50|$|SoMa {{explores the}} {{continuum}} of sexual orientation. <b>The</b> author <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> in an open society, where people are allowed to pursue their desires without restrictions or shame, simplistic black and white views of sexuality are replaced by orientations that exist as complex shades of gray.|$|R
2500|$|Critics such as Rackin {{interpret}} Shakespeare's metatheatrical {{references to}} the crossdressing on stage with less concern for societal elements {{and more of a}} focus on the dramatic ramifications. Rackin argues in her article on [...] "Shakespeare's Boy Cleopatra" [...] that Shakespeare manipulates the crossdressing to highlight a motif of the play—recklessness—which is discussed in the article as the recurring elements of acting without properly considering the consequences. Rackin cites the same quote, [...] "Antony/ Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see/ Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness/ I'th' posture of a whore" [...] to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> here the audience is reminded of the very same treatment Cleopatra is receiving on Shakespeare's stage (since she is being portrayed by a boy actor) (V.ii.214–217). Shakespeare, utilizing the metatheatrical reference to his own stage, perpetuates his motif of recklessness by purposefully shattering [...] "the audience's acceptance of the dramatic illusion".|$|E
2500|$|Van Tillians also {{stress the}} {{importance}} of reckoning with [...] "the noetic effects of sin" [...] (that is, the effects of sin on the mind), which, they maintain, corrupt man's ability to understand God, the world, and himself aright. [...] In their view, as a fallen creature, man does know the truth in each of these areas, but he seeks to find a different interpretation—one in which, as C. S. Lewis said, he is [...] "on the bench" [...] and God is [...] "in the dock." [...] The primary job of the apologist is, therefore, simply to confront the unbeliever with the fact that, while he is verbally denying the truth, he is nonetheless practically behaving in accord with it. [...] Van Til illustrated this alleged inconsistency as a child, elevated on the father's knee, reaching up to slap his face, and Bahnsen used the analogy of a man breathing out air to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> air doesn't exist.|$|E
2500|$|Ford’s work at El Pilar {{and with}} master Maya Forest gardeners is {{profiled}} in The Modern Maya Incidents of Travel and Friendship in Yucatan [...] (University of Texas Press 2012), a {{work on the}} living Maya by Macduff Everton. Everton’s narrative breadth shows the importance of historical perspectives on Maya landscapes for the conservation {{and development of the}} Maya Forest. Ford’s work converges with Everton’s and they have collaborated in the field and with presentations and publications that demonstrate the value of traditional Maya knowledge. Ford also collaborates with Ronald Nigh, an ethnologist and ecological anthropologist working with traditional Maya farmers. Their book, The Maya Forest Garden: Eight Millennia of Sustainable Cultivation of the Tropical Woodlands, examines both contemporary tropical farming techniques and the archaeological record to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> these ancient techniques, still in use today, can support significant populations over long periods of time. They argue that traditional Maya practices serve as solutions to contemporary problems, such as sustainability, climate change, and natural resource scarcity.|$|E
50|$|One may see Hankin as a {{successor}} of Oscar Wilde, whose comedies deconstructed prevailing Edwardian norms without offering any new values. Wilde criticised the traditional order, but his endings confirm rather than subvert its structures. Christopher Newton <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> Hankin was <b>the</b> comic bridge between Wilde and Noël Coward.|$|R
25|$|His reign {{signifies the}} {{promotion}} {{and possibly even}} {{the creation of the}} Silk Road between ancient China, India, and the western world.

2500|$|In February 2003 Cisco Systems sued Huawei Technologies for {{allegedly}} infringing on its patents and illegally copying source code used in its routers and switches. According to statement by Cisco, by July 2004 Huawei removed the contested code, manuals and command-line interfaces {{and the case}} was subsequently dropped. Both sides claimed success – with Cisco asserting that [...] "completion of lawsuit marks {{a victory for the}} protection of intellectual property rights", and Huawei's partner 3Com (which was not a part of lawsuit) noting that court order prevented Cisco from bringing another case against Huawei asserting the same or substantially similar claims. Although Cisco employees allegedly witnessed counterfeited technology as late as September 2005, in a retrospective Cisco's Corporate Counsel noted that [...] "Cisco was portrayed by the Chinese media as a bullying multi-national corporation" [...] and [...] "the damage to Cisco's reputation in China outweighed any benefit achieved through the lawsuit"; [...] however the same article that quoted the remarks of the Corporate Counsel also notes the remarks of Jay Hoenig of Hill and Associates, a security and risk management consultancy, who encouraged foreign companies to take greater advantage of civil litigation and said that it was hard to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> China's civil system was ineffectual if litigants did not pursue all of the legal remedies available to them.|$|E

50|$|Some {{commentators}} {{critical of}} the concept of nuclear peace further <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> nonstate actors and rogue states could supply nuclear weapons to terrorist organizations and thereby undermine conventional deterrence and therefore nuclear peace, especially with the existence of international terrorist networks seeking access to nuclear sources.|$|E

50|$|Brand {{language}} is a strategy {{that has been used}} to further political agendas and campaigns.

50|$|This {{character}}'s perhaps monstrous {{values and}} claims seem totally {{at odds with}} the humanism of Octave Mirbeau, a defender of Alfred Dreyfus.
