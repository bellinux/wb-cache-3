25|$|Mosquitoes {{of the genera}} Culex, Anopheles, Culiseta, <b>Mansonia</b> and Aedes may act as insect hosts {{for various}} Plasmodium species. The best studies of these have been the Anopheles {{mosquitoes}} which host Plasmodium parasites that cause human malaria, as well as Culex mosquitoes which host the Plasmodium species that cause malaria in birds. In all cases, only female mosquitoes can be infected with Plasmodium species, since only the females feed on the blood of vertebrate hosts.|$|E

5000|$|Isolation of {{this virus}} was tested via {{electron}} microscopy and testing on mice. Karshi virus has a one-way antigenic relationship with West Nile virus. Asimilar relationship with West Nile virus {{has been shown}} in Usutu virusisolated from <b>Mansonia</b> aurites in Uganda. However, this is a reverse type ofrelationship as compared with that between Karshi and West Nile viruses.It cannot be excluded that Karshi virus appeared due to antigenic drift in agenetically isolated population of West Nile virus.|$|E
50|$|Mosquitoes of {{the genus}} <b>Mansonia</b> {{complete}} their life cycle only {{in the presence of}} aquatic plants such as Pistia, laying their eggs under the leaves. The emerging larvae fall into the water within 24 hours and stay attached to the Pistia root (which is rich with air sacs) {{with the help of a}} serrated siphon tube for respiration and develop into pupa. The pupa is also attached to the pistia root with the serrated piercing siphon tube. The egg to adult mosquito development is completed within 7 days.|$|E
5000|$|Some other species, {{for example}} {{members of the}} genus <b>Mansonia,</b> lay their eggs in arrays, {{attached}} usually to the under-surfaces of waterlily pads.

Anopheles eggs may on occasion cluster together on the water, too, but the clusters do not generally look much like compactly glued rafts of eggs.|$|E
50|$|Culicinae pupae are aquatic {{and do not}} feed, {{but they}} do require air intake. All pupae must come to the water surface for air, with the {{exception}} of <b>Mansonia</b> and Coquillettidia species. Pupae are exarate, allowing movement of the exposed abdomen. Thrashing of the abdomen can move the pupae quickly, sideways or downward, but as soon as movement of the abdomen stops, the pupae return {{to the surface of the}} water. The pupa naturally rises to the surface of the water due to an air pocket between the wing cases that make it lighter than water. Pupation lasts as little as one day to as much as several weeks, because some diapause can occur.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mansonia</b> {{mosquitoes}} are big, {{black or}} brown mosquitoes with sparkling on their wings and legs. They breed in ponds and lakes containing certain aquatic plants, especially the floating type like Pistia stratiotes and water hyacinth. The eggs are laid in star-shaped clusters on the undersurface of leaves of these plants. The larvae and pupae are found {{attached to the}} rootlets of these plants by their siphon tubes. They obtain their air supply from these rootlets. When about to become adult, these pupae come {{to the surface of}} water and the fully formed adults emerge and escape. The control of Mansonoia mosquitoes is easy by removal or destruction of the aquatic host plants by herbicides.|$|E
5000|$|Vector {{control has}} been {{effective}} in virtually eliminating lymphatic filariasis in some regions, but vector control combined with chemotherapy produces the best results. It is suggested that 11-12 years of effective vector control may eliminate lymphatic filariasis. [...] Successful methods of B. malayi vector control include residual house spraying using DDT and insecticide treated bednets. <b>Mansonia</b> larvae attach their breathing tubes to underwater roots and plants in order to survive. While chemical larvicides have only provided partial control, plant removal would prevent vector development, but would have potential adverse effects on the aquatic environment. Lymphatic filariasis vector control is neglected {{in comparison to the}} far more established efforts to control malaria and dengue vectors. Integrated vector control methods should be applied in areas where the same mosquito species is responsible for transmitting multiple pathogens.|$|E
50|$|Brugia roundworms {{complete}} their life cycle {{in two different}} hosts. Mosquitos are the intermediate host in which the young larvae develop, and thus {{they are also the}} vectors of filariasis. Different species of <b>Mansonia</b> and Aedes act as the intermediate hosts. Humans (for B. malayi and B. timori), and animals (for B. pahangi and B. patei) acts as the definitive hosts in which the adult worms cause filariasis. The infective larvae called L3 (third stage) larvae are transmitted by an infected mosquito onto the skin of the definitive host. Once reaching the blood stream, they grow into adult roundworms. Male and female worms reproduce to release the young worms called microfilariae. These microfilariae move to peripheral blood stream from where they are picked up by another mosquito. Inside the mosquito, they became larvae, first L1 and then L3. The L3 larvae are stored in the proboscis from where they are ejected into the host during biting.|$|E
50|$|The microfilariae are {{transferred}} into a vector, which are most commonly mosquito {{species of the}} genera Culex, Anopheles, <b>Mansonia,</b> and Aedes. Inside the mosquito, the microfilariae mature into motile larvae called juveniles, these migrate to the labium {{after a period of}} approximately ten days. When the infected mosquito has its next blood meal, W. bancrofti larvae are deposited from the mouthparts on to the skin of the prospective host and migrate through micro-cuts in the dermis or the tract created by the proboscis into the blood stream of the new human host. The larvae move through the lymphatic system to regional lymph nodes, predominantly in the legs and genital area. The larvae develop into adult worms {{over the course of a}} year, and reach sexual maturity in the afferent lymphatic vessels. After mating, the adult female worm can produce thousands of microfilariae that migrate into the bloodstream. A mosquito vector can bite the infected human host, ingest the microfilariae, and thus repeat the life cycle. It is of note that the organism does not multiply within its intermediate host the mosquito.|$|E
5000|$|Similar {{to other}} flaviviruses, SPONV has a positive-sense single {{stranded}} RNA genome, which is approximately 11 kilobases in length. The RNA genome contains 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions that surround a single {{open reading frame}} (ORF) that encodes for a polyprotein that is specifically cleaved. The polyprotein is cleaved into three specific proteins: the capsid (C), the premembrane (prM) and the envelope (E) along with seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, 2K, NS4B, and NS5). The SPONV capsid is icosahedral and the similar to other flaviviruses which have an enveloped consisting of glycoproteins. These glycoproteins aid the virus in infection, through receptor mediated endocytosis. There are two reported strains of the Spondweni virus, the Chuku strain and the SA Ar 94 strain. The Chuku strain was the original strain isolated from a patient in Nigeria in 1952. This strain was originally misclassified as Zika virus, and this misidentification eventually lead to the 1955 South African SA 94 isolation from the <b>Mansonia</b> uniformis mosquito. [...] It has been demonstrated that both isolated SPONV strains are genetically similar, however they do exhibit {{a high degree of}} amino acid and nucleotide divergence, compared to the multiple ZIKV strains.|$|E
50|$|Culicinae larvae are {{adapted to}} almost every aquatic {{environment}} worldwide, excepting flowing streams and open areas of large water masses. Larvae have three body regions - head, thorax, and abdomen, {{as well as}} having compound eyes and antennae on their heads. The same body regions {{can be found in}} Culicinae adults, but the form of each region is very different in the larvae and adult. The larvae have four instars from hatching to pupation that occur over four days to two weeks.Culicinae larvae can be distinguished from larvae of other subfamilies by the presence of the posterior siphon. The siphon is used for breathing and breaks the water surface, so the larvae can take in air. Most species hang {{from the surface of the}} water, anterior end down, so the siphon stays at the water surface. Some species of <b>Mansonia</b> and Coquillettidia use the siphon differently, piercing underwater plants to take oxygen. Larvae eat small aquatic organisms and plant material in the water using brush-style and grinding mouth parts. A few species are predatory and have additional mouth parts for grasping. Larvae use jerks of their bodies for locomotion, combined with propulsion using the mouth bristles. They are sensitive to the conditions of the water in which they live, including light, temperature, and many other factors, and are also subject to predation and depend on aquatic vegetation to hide from predators.|$|E
5000|$|Psorophora ferox was {{the only}} {{mosquito}} species directly implicated in transmission through detection of virus in specimens collected at the outbreak site, but species of Culex (Melanoconion), Coquillettidia chrysonotum, <b>Mansonia</b> indubitans, Ochlerotatus scapularis, Ochlerotatus serratus, and other mosquitoes in Tribes Culicini, Anophelini and Sabethini were also present in those collections. [...] Studies with mosquitoes from the epidemic zone after the outbreak showed that Psorophora ferox and Ochlerotatus scapularis {{could be classified as}} potential vectors, but Ochlerotatus serratus was relatively insusceptible. Field investigations in the late 1970s and 1980s showed that Ochlerotatus scapularis, Ochlerotatus serratus and species of Culex (Melanoconion) were the predominant mosquitoes in the epidemic zone, and that Ochlerotatus scapularis was the most common and abundant mosquito in human settlements and human-made environments. Outside the epidemic zone, laboratory studies have shown that Culex tarsalis mosquitoes from Arizona and Culex pipiens pipiens mosquitoes from Illinois were relatively efficient experimental vectors; Tennessee Culex pipiens subspecies and Argentina Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus were moderately efficient experimental vectors; Louisiana Psorophora ferox, and Culex nigripalpus and Culex (Melanoconion) opisthopus from Florida were relatively inefficient experimental vectors. Psorophora ferox and Aedes scapularis were shown to be susceptible to per os infection with Rocio virus and could transmit the virus by bite following an incubation period, whereas infection rates in Ochlerotatus serratus did not exceed 36% and an ID50 could not be calculated for this species so it is unlikely to be an epidemiologically important vector of Rocio virus.|$|E
40|$|A {{mosquito}} community {{study was}} conducted in Sebubus village (filariasis endemic area), South Sumatera. This study aims to determine mosquitoes' contact with human, reconfirm vector of filariasis, and calculate microfilaria rate. There were 369 mosquitoes collected during the study, which consisted of Sspecies, namely <b>Mansonia</b> uniformis, <b>Mansonia</b> bonneae/dives, Culex spp., Anopheles separatus, and Aedes aegypti. The man-biting rate of <b>Mansonia</b> uniformis as a confirmed vector of filariasis in South Sumatera peaks at 20. 00 - 22. 00 (outdoor) and 20. 00 - 21. 00 (indoor). <b>Mansonia</b> dives as the main species collected has a man-biting rate that peaks at 18. 00 - 19. 00 (outdoor) and 20. 00 - 21. 00 (indoor). From all the mosquitoes collected, no filarial larvae was found in their salivary glands. There are 2 glass film slides found positive with Brugia malayi species, and the microfilaria rate is 1. 12 %.   Keywords : Filariasis, <b>Mansonia,</b> Microfilaria Rate</p...|$|E
