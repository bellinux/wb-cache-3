40|$|Although the {{increasing}} economic importance of Eucalyptus lumber to furniture and other value added products manufacturing, its industrial use is still small. One {{of the main}} reasons is the difficulty to dry the lumber and related loses of raw material. There is a general recommendation in literature to use a low drying rate in initial stages of the process, and changing to a more aggressive drying after removal of liquid water from the lumber. According classical theory about drying of porous material, this point should coincide with the predominance of diffusion phenomena in the moisture movement; which could be determined through the characteristic drying curve of the material. With the objective to get better knowledge about the drying of Eucalyptus grandis lumber, its characteristic drying curve was determined, and the results proved that Eucalyptus grandis lumber is not permeable to liquid flow. Based on its characteristic drying curve, it is possible to suggest the change of drying conditions when lumber <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>basis,</b> is between 35 % and 40 %, then starting a more aggressive dryin...|$|E

Bulk densities of pods and kernels were 0. 27, 0. 29 and 0. 27 g/cm 3, the corresponding true densities were 0. 53, 0. 53 and 0. 38 g/cm 3 and the corresponding porosities were 47. 11, 43 and 28. 4 % for Manipintar, Local I and Local II respectively for the pods. The mean values of rupture force for groundnut pods of Manipintar through length, width and thickness were 1. 19 N/mm, 3. 99 N/mm and 5. 25 N/mm respectively while that of Local I were 0. 84 N/mm, 4. 63 N/mm, and 6. 50 N/mm respectively.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. Pili grass (Heteropogon contortus (L.) P. Beauv. ex Roem. & Schult.) is a {{culturally}} and ecologically important native species in Hawaiʻi {{that has been}} used for re-vegetation of severely degraded land. Currently, it is being evaluated for expanded use on roadside and streambank stabilization, water efficient landscaping and agricultural buffer strip plantings. Despite efforts to increase its use on a variety of re-vegetation applications, planting materials such as seeds are still in limited supply. In order to develop large scale seed production protocols, studies on seed dormancy and seed harvest timing need to be conducted. The three main objectives of this dissertation were to: 1) elucidate the mechanisms involved in pili grass seed dormancy loss through the use of scarification and germination stimulants (i. e., gibberellic acid [GA], fluridone, food grade liquid smoke [FGLS], pili grass smoke infused water, xylose smoke infused water, karrikinolide and cyanide); 2) assess the effect of storage factors (i. e., seed <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> and temperature) on pili grass seed dormancy loss and viability; and 3) determine an average cumulative growing degree unit (ACGDU) correlated indicator which has potential use for determining the optimum seed harvest timing. Studies on seed scarification, germination with stimulants and dormancy loss under different storage conditions support the placement of pili grass under the non-deep physiological dormancy class of seeds. The observed partial germination with scarification (i. e., exposure of the embryo) suggests the presence of both physical and physiological dormancy controls. Germination assays with the plant growth regulators, fluridone and GA, as well as with FGLS suggests that the abscisic acid (ABA) :GA balance {{plays an important role in}} pili grass seed dormancy. Seed germination response to chemical stimulants across a gradient in dormancy relief supports the theory of increased effective levels of GA as storage duration increases. Short term seed storage studies (i. e., 1 year or less) show that dormancy and seed viability loss is affected by storage temperature and equilibrium relative humidity (eRH) (i. e., seed <b>moisture</b> <b>content).</b> Storage at 10 °C, regardless of eRH, maintained seed dormancy and viability for one year. To optimize dormancy loss while maintaining seed viability, fresh seeds must be stored at either 12 % eRH (6 % seed <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> <b>dry</b> weight <b>basis)</b> at 30 °C for 12 months or at 50 % eRH (11 % seed <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> <b>dry</b> weight <b>basis)</b> at 30 °C for 9 months. As storage temperature was increased from 20 to 30 °C and storage relative humidity was increased from 50 to 75 % eRH (11 to 14 % seed <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> <b>dry</b> weight <b>basis),</b> loss in seed viability became more pronounced over time. The viability of pili grass seeds, relieved of dormancy, can be maintained for at least 6 months with storage at 12 % eRH (6 % seed <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> <b>dry</b> weight <b>basis)</b> and 5 °C. FGLS, pili grass smoke infused water and xylose smoke infused water were effective in stimulating germination of dormant pili grass seeds. FGLS and pili grass smoke infused water provided consistent germination stimulation in two batches of seed that represented two levels of dormancy relief. Xylose infused smoke water was less effective since its ability to stimulate germination was not consistent across the two seed batches. Assays which evaluated two bioactive compounds found in smoke (i. e., karrikinolide and cyanide) indicated that only cyanide stimulated germination (20 to 29 % germination) of dormant pili grass seeds. Cyanide stimulated germination suggests the role of reactive oxygen species in dormancy loss of pili grass seeds under warm, dry conditions. The presence of cyanide was confirmed in pili grass smoke, but not in FGLS or xylose smoke infused water. Germination observed in these non-cyanide containing smoke sources indicates the presence of other bioactive compounds in smoke. Germination assays conducted throughout this dissertation indicated differences in depth of dormancy with time of year harvest. March seeds exhibited the lowest levels of dormancy compared to seeds harvested in June, July and October. Seasonal dormancy in pili grass seeds can be attributed to differences in growing conditions during seed development. Finally, harvest timing studies identified ACGDU, spike <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> and the onset of seed head tangling as useful harvest timing indicators for pili grass seed production. Results indicate that maximum seed harvests can be obtained between 768 to 778 ACGDUs (79 to 82 days after cutting) under irrigated conditions. Spike moisture for optimum seed harvest timing was determined to be between 0. 68 to 0. 72 grams H 2 O per gram of dry weight. The onset of seed head tangling provided a visual cue which coincided with the optimum seed yield and range of spike <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> A decline in seed production over four harvest cycles (spanning two years) was recorded with possible causal factors such as stand age, cutting height and thatch accumulation...|$|R

Furthermore, it also demonstrates the variation in spatial distribution of moisture content within the skin sample when moisture content and temperature dependency are introduced in the diffusivity.

Dielectric properties of wood depend on <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> density, temperature, grain angle and frequency of the electromagnetic wave.

An X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner was used to detect density and, with that, <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> in wood.

Previous studies have shown that this method gives a good description of the interactions between wood and microwaves in two dimensions.

PMB- 021, which was provided by the Disease Management Research Center of the Plant Pathology Department of the National Chung Hsing University, in an attempt to solve the problem of agricultrual wastes and to provide a new source of material of fiber for industries such as pulping and reproductive energy. At first, established the standard for measuring the bio-pulping efficiency of rice straw, including a 24 -hour drying time and the repulping time is 60 seconds, and also obtained the <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> (<b>dry</b> <b>basis)</b> of the rice straw was 8. 91 %, which harvested from the agriculture experimental station of NCHU. Based on the preliminary studies on bio-pulping of rice straws by Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 at 30, 35 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60 ℃, there was no significant difference in basic bio-pulping efficiencies without shaking, while in shaking condition Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 showed the optimal efficiency at 45 ℃ with the recovery of 61. 45 %. Our results thus suggest that Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 requires a shaking condition to obtain a batter efficiency of bio-pulping for rice straw. The bio-pulping reactor in this study was composed of a tank, a stirring apparatus, a power controlling system, a temperature controlling system and other auxiliary devices. The agitation of this reactor adopted the compressing of reciprocating motion. The reciprocating motion angle experiments suggest that the reactor shows disproportionate mixing in 90 ° reciprocating motion by the over-stirring of rice straw, while 45 ° proved to be a better stirring angle of bio-pulping reactor with the recovery of 64. 70 % and the rice straws displayed proportionate mixing and was completely submerged in the reagent. Comparing the results of the experiments with or without Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 under 45 ° reciprocating motion angle process demonstrates that the bio-pulping reactor in this study is able to degrade rice straws efficiently, and that Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 could function in the bio-pulping reactor of this study. The no-stirring experiment of the bio-pulping reactor displayed the natural microorganisms inside rice straws also have the ability of bio-pulping, the potential of which needs to be further investigated in the future. Intermittent bio-pulping process studies demonstrate that the Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 would be hindered from the process without continued stirring. The reaction time of the bio-pulping process should be controlled less than 2 days to prevent hemicellulose lost. The efficiency of bio-pulping can be increased by improving the stirring apparatus and pretreat the rice straw. 摘要 本研究旨在利用國立中興大學植物病理學系病害管理研究室提供之Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 進行稻草生物製漿反應器之開發與探討，以解決稻草廢棄物處理之問題，亦由此方式提供製漿或生殖能源等工業一種新的纖維原料來源。首先本研究確立稻草分解效率判定方式，其包括稻草纖維回收率測定時所需要的乾燥時間為 24 小時，而散漿時間則以 60 秒為佳，並獲致本研究所使用之中興大學北溝農場之風乾梗稻，其乾基含水率為 8. 91 %。 依據Bacillus sp.

PMB- 021 能有效於反應器內進行纖維解離。反應器無攪動對照組試驗中亦發現，稻草本身所內含之雜菌亦具有解離纖維之能力，有關其是否具備生物製漿之潛力則需進一步探討。而間歇運轉試驗結果則顯示若無持續擾動，將影響Bacillus sp. PMB- 021 進行稻草生物製漿之能力；且未來有關稻草生物製漿之反應時間應以兩天以內為佳，以考量保留更多之半纖維素成分，然而未來仍須解決攪拌機構容易造成攪拌不均之問題，或是透過適當之稻草前處理，來增進稻草生物製漿之效率。目錄 謝 誌	i 摘要	ii Abstract	iv 目錄	vii 圖目錄	x 表目錄	xiii 第一章 緒論	 1 1 - 1 前言	 1 1 - 2 研究目的	 3 第二章 文獻探討	 4 2 - 1 稻草	 4 2 - 1 - 1 稻的種類	 4 2 - 1 - 2 稻草結構	 5 2 - 1 - 3 稻草成分	 9 2 - 2 纖維	 12 2 - 2 - 1 纖維素	 12 2 - 2 - 2 半纖維素(hemicellulose) 	 15 2 - 2 - 3 木質素(lignin) 	 17 2 - 2 - 4 植物纖維(plant fiber) 	 18 2 - 3 製漿工業	 20 2 - 3 - 1 機械製漿(mechanical pulping) 	 21 2 - 3 - 2 化學製漿(chemical pulping) 	 24 2 - 3 - 2 - 1 	牛皮漿法(kraft process) 	 25 2 - 3 - 2 - 2 	亞硫酸法(sulfite process) 	 25 2 - 3 - 3 生物製漿(bio-pulping) 	 26 2 - 4 散漿與洗漿	 29 2 - 5 反應器	 30 2 - 5 - 1 反應器之操作方式分類	 30 2 - 5 - 2 生物反應器	 32 2 - 5 - 3 固態發酵	 36 第三章 實驗方法與設備	 41 3 - 1 實驗目的與內容	 41 3 - 2 試驗方法	 41 3 - 2 - 1 	稻草切斷處理方式	 42 3 - 2 - 2 	稻草溶液調製方式	 42 3 - 2 - 3 	散漿方式	 43 3 - 2 - 4 	沖洗過篩方式	 43 3 - 2 - 5 	乾燥物乾物秤重方式	 44 3 - 2 - 6 稻草反應回收率	 44 3 - 3 實驗設備與儀器	 45 3 - 3 - 1 量測設備與儀器	 45 3 - 3 - 2 反應器使用之儀器與材料	 52 3 - 4 試驗材料	 56 3 - 4 - 1 稻草	 56 3 - 4 - 2 菌種	 56 3 - 4 - 3 培養液	 57 3 - 5 實驗規劃與實驗流程	 58 3 - 6 稻草分解效率判定方式	 61 3 - 6 - 1 建立散漿時間試驗與結果	 61 3 - 6 - 2 建立沖洗過篩方式	 65 3 - 6 - 3 建立乾燥時間試驗與結果	 66 3 - 7 稻草生物製漿基礎試驗	 69 3 - 7 - 1 Bacillus sp.

Deformation varied significantly (P < 0. 02) with crop type and was the highest in lupine seeds. Feed pea had the highest strain resistance value. Both deformation energy and volume energy requirements varied significantly (P < 0. 0001) with crop type. Moduli of deformation of compressed feed pea, lupine, and soybean at an applied force of 100 kN were 269. 7, 306. 3, and 455. 2 MPa, indicating the proportionate resistance of the crop materials to compressive strain. Precisely 4. 43, 3. 76, and 3. 15 MJ m- 3 are required to achieve 56. 7, 77. 0, and 67. 7 % or 461. 7, 539. 3, and 500. 4 kg m- 3 gains in bulk density in feed pea, lupine, and soybean, respectively. Deformation and volume energy demands correlated negatively (r = - 0. 934 and r = - 0. 78) with lipid presence. Crops with more oil appeared to deform more easily under compressive force.

Three sites namely: Waterworks road (WR), Hill top (HT) and Azuiyiokwu (AZ) were randomly selected. Soil samples were collected from 0 - 15 cm and 15 - 30 cm depths from the sites. The soil samples were analyzed for physicochemical properties. The results showed variations in soil properties of the three sites which indicate suitability of the different sites or otherwise for waste disposal. The relationship between percent sand <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> on <b>dry</b> mass <b>basis</b> and total porosity was generally highly significant (P> 0. 01). Similarly, the relationship between percent sand and saturated hydraulic conductivity was also highly significant. Available P highly correlated with total porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity. The sites with high sand percentage are good for refuse disposal while the ones with high clay percentage have problems of water logging and build up of pollution for ground water.

40|$|The aims of {{this work}} were to adjust {{different}} mathematical models to experimental data describing the drying of the Valiosa cultivar soybean grain, to determine and to evaluate the effective diffusion coefficient and to obtain the activation energy and the thermodynamic properties of the drying process under different air conditions. The experiments were conducted at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Goiás (Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia Goiano – Câmpus Rio Verde). The Valiosa cultivar soybean grains, with an initial <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> on a <b>dry</b> <b>basis</b> of 0. 56 (d. b., decimal), were dried in an oven with forced air ventilation at five different temperatures (40, 55, 70, 85 and 100 °C) until reaching a <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> of 0. 133 ± 0. 019 (d. b.). Of the models analyzed, Page’s model was selected to best represent the drying phenomenon. The effective diffusion coefficient of soybeans increased with the air temperature and was described by the Arrhenius equation; an activation energy of 22. 77 kJ mol– 1 was reported for liquid diffusion in the drying of the soybeans.

40|$|A red Asian ginseng {{preparation}} {{was prepared}} as follows: fresh Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng) roots were first steamed {{for half an}} hour to several hours, and then the steamed roots were dried into died roots (red Asian ginseng, 10 % <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> on a <b>dry</b> <b>basis).</b> During steaming, the color of ginseng (white) turned yellow and brown during subsequent steaming. Color is an important index for grading red Asian ginseng. In this study, the effects of drying time and temperature on the surface color formation (L, a/b) of the Asian ginseng, and the color formation (L, a/b) of the red Asian ginseng powder were investigated. The value of L decreased, while the value of a/b increased as drying proceeded; the value of L was slightly influenced by the drying temperature, but the value of a/b was markedly influenced. With respect to the color of the final product (red ginseng), the value of L was slightly influenced by steaming time and temperature, while the value of a/b was increased as steaming time and drying temperature increased. Based on the nth-order rate equation and Arrhenius equation, a kinetic model for describing these effects was established, and the results were satisfactorily fitting. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the {{commercial}} potential of oil extraction and biodiesel production derived from vegetable seed is being realized. The process energy input requirements are {{important factors in}} oil extraction and biodiesel production. This research work investigated oil extraction from flax seeds and compared extraction yield with the energy load. The effect of <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> on the oil yield was compared between a mechanical oil expeller, organic solvent extraction, organic solvent and microwave assisted, organic solvent and ultrasonic assisted, and combined microwave and ultrasonic with organic solvent. The maximum oil yields % wt/wt from these techniques was 22. 6 %, 36. 3 %, 10. 0 %, 42. 0 % and 27. 8 %, respectively. The <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> {{had a significant effect}} on oil yield with the mechanical oil expeller, organic solvent method and ultrasonic assisted extraction, whereas no or little effect was found on microwave-assisted extraction. The microwave-assisted extraction showed better results compared with the ultrasonic-assisted and combined treatment methods. The relative energy consumption of these processes was experimentally investigated; energy ratios were calculated based on the amount of energy recovered to the amount of energy supplied to the flax seed for oil extraction. The net energy ratios showed that microwave-assisted extraction had the highest (25. 21 %), followed by organic solvent method (14. 04 %), ultrasonic method (6. 33 %) and lowest was with combined ultrasonic and microwave assisted treatment (5. 73 %). These results showed that flax seed oil can be extracted using microwave-assisted methods efficiently and in an energy feasible manner. In situ ultrasonic transesterification was applied to powdered samples with 4 %, 8 % and 12 % <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> (on % <b>dry</b> <b>basis)</b> within an ultrasonic bath having an intensity of 0. 124 [*]W/cm 2.

Ash was highest(7. 18 ± 0. 97 %) in solanum nigrum L seeds (SNS) followed by gumbo (Abelmoschus esclentus) seeds (AES) with a value of 5. 68 ± 0. 12 % and was lowest (3. 7 ± 0. 97 %) in sesame (SIS). Protein ranged from 37. 6 ± 1. 07 %in moringa olifeira (MOS) to 17. 04 ± 0. 67 % in SNS. Sesame seed (SIS) had the highest crude fat of 54 ± 0. 16 %, followed by TCS (51. 80 ± 0. 21 %) and the lowest value of 10. 57 ± 0. 05 % in AHS. Values for SISand TCS did not differ significantly. Total carbohydrates were generally low in all the seeds and ranged from 13. 6 % in MOS to 36. 58 % in AES, only the AHS has a high total carbohydrate value (58. 31 %). The oil seedswere found to be good sources of minerals. The physical properties of the oil extracts showed the state to beliquid at room temperature (20 ± 1 ºC). All the studied oil samples contain the oleic and linoleic acids, these oilscan be classified in the oleic-linoleic acid group. It can be inferred that the oil seeds investigated (except AHSwhich has a weak oil yield environ 10 %) are good sources of crude fat, crude protein, ash, energy and minerals. The oil extracts exhibited good physicochemical properties and could be useful as edible oils and for industrialapplications...|$|R
