The Freys agreed to use Tommy on the does whose kids they were not planning to keep. Rose was the last doe bred to Tommy and before she freshened on May 23, 1938, Tommy, his mother, and all of his offspring up to that point had been either sold or destroyed. Rose's kids by that breeding to Tommy were a Nubian-French Alpine looking buck, like his mother, and a beautiful short-eared doeling with curly golden-brown hair and very large eyes. The Frey's decided to keep her and named her 'Peggy'. Peggy was the first kid born into the Frey's herd with such ears and she {{turned out to be an}} outstanding milker, though a small doe. Unofficial <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> <b>records</b> kept by Mrs. Frey showed that Peggy produced ten to twelve pounds of milk a day, with fourteen pounds on her record day; just shy of two gallons. She was Fay Frey's pride and joy and was taught several tricks. Louise Erbe of K-Lou ranch remembered seeing Mrs. Frey parading Peggy around on a leash.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the forage based total mixed ration (TMR) in crossbred lactating cows on <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> and nutrient digestibility. TMR was prepared by mixing wheat straw, chapped green forages (sorghum and rice bean in experiment I and oat and berseem in experiment II) and concentrate feed having 17 percent dietary CP. Two feeding experiments for the period of 60 days duration each during rainy (experiment I) and winter seasons (experiment II) were conducted in first lactating crossbred cows. In both the experiment six first lactating cows were taken and divided into 2 groups. Group 1 (T 1) was fed TMR and in Group 2 (T 2) ingredients were fed separately. The total daily dry matter intake (DMI) in cows fed TMR increased significantly (p˂ 0. 01) by 15. 92 percent in experiment I, when multi cut sorghum and rice bean used as green fodder. However, the differences were negligible in experiment II,when oat and berseem used as green fodder. The dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) digestibility as well as digestible energy (DE) value of ration were increased significantly (p˂ 0. 01) in cows fed on TMR based on berseem and oat as green fodder in experiment II. However, differences were non-significant in experiment I, when multi cut sorghum and rice bean used as green fodder in TMR.

An insemination was defined successful when not followed by another insemination and when the cow calved between 267 and 295 days after insemination, or when the cow was culled between 135 and 295 days after the last insemination. Breed, parity, days in milk, lactation curve characteristics, <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> traits, moment of AI related to peak milk yield time (before or after peak milk yield), the last calf (female, male, twin or stillbirth) and season of insemination were selected as independent parameters for a model with successful rate of insemination as dependent parameter. A multivariable logistic regression model was used within cow and farm as a random effect. The probability of successful insemination was the highest in the first insemination and decreased in the following inseminations. However, the success rate of all inseminations increased in a later stage of lactation. The improvement in the successful inseminations in a later stage of lactation was better in multiparous cows than in first parity cows. Insemination in summer and before peak milk yield time reduced the success of insemination. The success rate was the lowest in 100 % Holstein Friesian cows compared with other breeds and was the highest when the last calf was a female calf compared to a male calf, twin or stillbirth. In conclusion, the success of first and following inseminations depended on parity, breed, season of insemination, last calf status, daily milk yield at insemination date, serial insemination number and days in milk at insemination dat...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} hemoplasmosis on cattle productivity. Prevalence of bovine hemoplasma was examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using whole blood samples collected from 93 breeding cows and their 71 calves in Hokkaido, Japan. Monthly <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> <b>records</b> and other clinical data were compared between Mycoplasma wenyonii (Mw) -infected, “Candidatus My-coplasma haemobos ” (CMh) -infected, co-infected and PCR-negative groups. Blood chemical parameters {{were obtained from the}} 93 cows and 64 calves. PCR results showed that 89. 2 % (83 / 93) of cows and 14. 1 % (10 / 71) of calves were positive for bovine hemoplasma. Based on productivity data obtained from the 93 cows, Mw-infected, CMh-infected and co-infected cows had significantly lower monthly milk yield compared to PCR-negative cows. Furthermore, decline in milk yield was prolonged in CMh-infected and co-infected groups. No significant differences were found for other clinical findings among the four groups. Calf birth weight tended to be lower for Mw-infected, CMh-infected and co-infected groups compared to the PCR-negative group. There {{were no significant differences in}} all blood parameters of cows and calves among the four groups. In addition, no significant differences were found in any parameter between hemoplasma-infected and PCR-negative calves.

40|$|Genetic {{potentials}} (pedigree-estimated breeding value) {{for milk}} and for fat were compared in cows grouped according to subclinical stage of bovine leukemia virus infection. Genetic potential for milk production was significantly greater in seropositive cows with persistent lymphocytosis (622 +/- 72 kg) and in seropositive hematologically normal cows (554 +/- 34 34 kg) than in seronegative herdmates (418 +/- 53 kg). When 305 -day twice-daily-milking mature equivalent <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> <b>records</b> {{for the current}} lactation were adjusted for genetic potential, bovine leukemia virus-infected cows that were hematologically normal had significantly greater milk production than did seronegative herdmates, suggesting that early bovine leukemia virus infection was positively associated with milk yield. Genetic potential for fat production was significantly greater for cows with persistent lymphocytosis (21 +/- 2 kg) than for other seropositive (16 +/- 1 kg) and seronegative herdmates (13 +/- 2 kg); however, 305 -day twice-daily-milking mature equivalent fat production for the current lactation was not significantly different between the groups. Thus, cows with persistent lymphocytosis did not produce fat according to their genetic potential. As an apparent consequence of tendencies for greater milk yield and less fat production, milk fat percentage was significantly reduced in cows with persistent lymphocytosis (3. 33 +/- 0. 09 %) and other seropositive cows (3. 48 +/- 0. 05 %) relative to seronegative herdmates (3. 67 +/- 0. 07 %). These results suggest a need to reevaluate {{the economic impact of}} bovine leukemia virus infection on the dairy industry...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{calculate}} new accumulated and daily functions {{based on the}} Michaelis-Menten equation to estimate the 305 -days production of Gir cows using test day milk yields. Data consisted of 7, 412 lactation records of 3, 416 Gir cows (Bos indicus) collected from 1987 to 2004 in 51 herds assisted by the National Breeding Program of the Dairy Gir, coordinated by the Dairy Cattle National Research Center (EMBRAPA) and the Brazilian Association of Dairy Gir Breeders (ABCGIL). The models included the effects of herd milk production (High and Low), calving season (dry e rainy) and parity order (OP 1 to 5 and > 5). Residual Standard Deviation values ranged from 0. 131 to 0. z 984. Estimates for the Coefficient of Determination (R²) were close to one and for the Durbin-Watson coefficient were close to two. Values of statistics of Theil (U) were close to zero for UM and UV and close to one for UC suggesting a good fitting for the function. The persistency of milk yield {{is related to the}} parameter d and the time of the pick yield is related to both parameters d and n. The new functions are characterized by simplicity of the fitting procedure, biological interpretability of the parameters and flexibility to convert the daily function to the accumulated function. The new functions are an alternative to project lactations with records in progress to estimate the production required in genetic evaluation systems based on 305 -day <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> <b>records...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{discrepancy}} between the estimated feeding value of fresh grass and the output per kg grass in terms of milk and maintenance was studied by evaluating 12 experiments with grass-fed dairy cows. The percentage grass in the diets varied between 40 and 90. Intake and <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> were <b>recorded</b> daily. Per treatment a number of parameters relating to {{the composition of the}} grass, characteristics of the animals, and composition of the total diet were determined. The correlation between each of these parameters and the measured discrepancy was calculated. The digestible organic matter in the grass (DOM), intake of grass, intestinal digestible protein in the total diet, percentage milk protein and body weight gain correlated well with the discrepancy. It was concluded that energy input from grass and energy output in <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> were significantly different (P< 0. 05). For the diets with 80 – 90 % grass a high DOM increased discrepancy. It was furthermore concluded that the maintenance requirements of lactating dairy cows fed grass-based diets are probably higher than the currently used values This was ascribed to energy requirements in the gastro-intestinal tract and to nitrogen excretion...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} space {{availability}} on productive and reproductive performances {{have been evaluated}} in buffalo cows. The trial was carried out on 124 lactating buffaloes (69 ± 84 days in milk) equally divided in two experimental groups (group 1 and group 2) with different space availability (15 vs 20 m 2 / head). Daily <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> was <b>recorded</b> in each group and a sample of milk was monthly analysed for fat and protein contents. Furthermore, fertility and intercalving and start trial-conception (number of days {{from the beginning of}} the trial until conception) intervals were also evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA with repeated measures for productive parameters and by Student’s t Test for intercalving and start trial-conception intervals. Buffaloes in Group 2 showed higher (P< 0. 05) <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> in both the initial (74 to 104 days in milk) and final (around 230 days in milk) phases of the lactation curve compared to animals in Group 1. No differences emerged for qualitative characteristics of milk and reproductive parameters. In conclusion the increase of space availability improve animal milk yield in buffalo cows while reproductive performances are not modified...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} on 20 animals, including four buffalo calves, four buffalo heifers, four lactating crossbred cows and eight lactating Murrah buffaloes, suffering from ecto/endo parasites, dermatitis etc. The animals were divided into four comparable groups {{of one or two}} each as limited number of animal suffering from parasitic infestation, lice, ticks, mites, maggots and dermatitis were available. Three patent drugs having Moxidectin (Cydectin) Acaricide Pyrethroid (Poron) and Flumenthrin (Bayticol) as active compounds were used in prescribed doses of 1 ml / 10 kg body weight and poured over the vertebral column from the occipital condyl {{to the base of the}} tail only once. All observations like skin conditions of infestation of lice, ticks, mites, alopecia and dermatitis, body weight and <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> were <b>recorded</b> before starting the experiment and at the close of the experiment after two months, Group 1 served and control c where only ordinary water was poure...|$|R
