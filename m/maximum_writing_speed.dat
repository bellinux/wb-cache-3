40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [61627826, 51672292, 61137002]In {{order to}} realize {{high-speed}} laser writing arbitrary patterns, we establish {{a set of}} high-speed polar coordinate laser writing system. Although the polar coordinate laser writing system is generally suitable for fabricating circular symmetric patterns, there are challenges when dealing with arbitrary patterns. Here, we propose an effective method {{to solve this problem}} by converting the pattern data from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates for high-speed laser writing of arbitrary patterns. Several types of arbitrary patterns are written on chalcogenide thin films with a minimum pattern linewidth of 700 +/- 70 nm and a <b>maximum</b> <b>writing</b> <b>speed</b> of approximately 10 m/s,which corresponds to more than 600 mm(2) /min at 1. 0 mu m linewidth.

40|$|Representing an {{intuitive}} spelling interface for brain–computer interfaces (BCI) in the auditory domain is not straight-forward. In consequence, all existing approaches based on event-related potentials (ERP) rely {{at least partially}} on a visual representation of the interface. This online study introduces an auditory spelling interface that eliminates the necessity for such a visualization. In up to two sessions, a group of healthy subjects (N[*]=[*] 21) was asked to use a text entry application, utilizing the spatial cues of the AMUSE paradigm (Auditory Multi-class Spatial ERP). The speller relies on the auditory sense both for stimulation and the core feedback.

40|$|Synchro-ballistic use of rotating-mirror streak cameras {{allows for}} {{detailed}} recording of high-speed events of known velocity and direction. After {{an introduction to}} the synchro-ballistic technique, this paper details two diverse applications of the technique as applied in the field of high-explosives research. In the first series of experiments detonation-front shape is recorded as the arriving detonation shock wave tilts an obliquely mounted mirror, causing reflected light to be deflected from the imaging lens. These tests were conducted for the purpose of calibrating and confirming the asymptotic Detonation Shock Dynamics (DSD) theory of Bdzil and Stewart. The phase velocities of the events range from ten to thirty millimeters per microsecond. Optical magnification is set for optimal use of the film`s spatial dimension and the phase velocity is adjusted to provide synchronization at the camera`s <b>maximum</b> <b>writing</b> <b>speed.</b> Initial calibration of the technique is undertaken using a cylindrical HE geometry over a range of charge diameters and of sufficient length-to-diameter ratio to insure a stable detonation wave. The final experiment utilizes an arc-shaped explosive charge, resulting in an asymmetric detonation-front record. The second series of experiments consists of photographing a shaped-charge jet having a velocity range of two to nine millimeters per microsecond. To accommodate the range of velocities it is necessary to fire several tests, each synchronized to a different section of the jet. The experimental apparatus consists of a vacuum chamber to preclude atmospheric ablation of the jet tip with shocked-argon back lighting to produce a shadow-graph image...|$|E
