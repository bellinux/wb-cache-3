After the election, Zardari promised to approve the constitutional provision that removed the President's power to dismiss Parliament, but public scepticism remained on whether he would actually carry out his promise. His economic competence was questioned after allegations that he had raised grain procurement prices through inflationary subsidies and scrapped the capital gains tax. His first parliamentary speech was overshadowed by 20 September Islamabad <b>Marriott</b> <b>Hotel</b> bombing. A few days later, he went to the United Nations Headquarters in New York City on his first overseas trip as President.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Chicago Mayor Harold Washington {{approved}} a $24million subsidy to FJV Venture to develop Block 37. There were {{a series of}} subsequent alternate redevelopment plans. Among the prior redevelopment plans for the block were the original Block 37 Towers, for which the original block was demolished and which included a 47-story tower designed by Murphy/Jahn, Inc. Another failed plan was a Solomon Cordwell Buenz plan including a 711-foot 66-story residential tower and a 12-story <b>Marriott</b> <b>Hotel</b> towering over a 4-story retail base. This had followed the 39-story Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates design scheduled for 2004 completion. The developments fell through, which put the property back into the city's possession. In 2002, the city initiated a competition for the development rights to the property. In 2004, the city sold the property to Mills Corp. at a $20million loss. Mills sold the development rights to Joseph Freed and Associates in 2005, when the city committed $42million in tax-increment funding. In 2007, the city learned the development was $150million over budget. The complex was originally being developed by commercial real estate developer Mills Corporation, {{best known for its}} ownership of numerous super-regional shopping malls. However, Joseph Freed and Associates LLC has inherited the development rights.|$|E
