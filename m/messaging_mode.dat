40|$|Background: Digital {{technologies}} are ever more present in our lives, {{and are being}} applied in numerous areas of our existence including the area {{of health care and}} health information. Problematic alcohol and drug use impose a major global burden on health, and it is of interest to find new ways of reaching out to those affected by the problem. Interventions delivered over the Internet and in the form of smartphone apps have the potential to be readily available at all times and places. Many apps are publicly available, but only a tiny proportion have been evaluated. Also, there are many evaluated self-help applications for the Internet, but research on the addition of counselor guidance over the Internet is very scarce. There is a need for scientific scrutiny before being able to either recommend or implement these applications into regular care. Aims: The aims of this doctoral project were: to carry out a preliminary evaluation of an Internet-based program for problematic use with guidance among Internet help-seekers; to investigate effects of three smartphone apps, two with estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC) feedback and a skills-training app, among university students; and to determine the prevalence of problematic substance use in a psychiatric population receiving treatment over the Internet, and to explore whether that substance use was associated with treatment outcomes. Methods: An Internet-based eight-module program was tested in a randomized controlled pilot study with 80 participants. Participants were randomized to: no guidance, guidance over secure email messaging, or choice between guidance over asynchronous secure email messaging or synchronous chat messaging (STUDY I). Effects of two smartphone apps, Promillekoll and PartyPlanner, both with real-time eBAC feedback, and one, PartyPlanner, offering the possibility to simulate a drinking event beforehand and compare afterwards to the real event, were tested in a randomized controlled trial with 1929 university students having problematic alcohol consumption. Both app groups were compared to assessment-only controls (STUDY II). The effects of offering university students with excessive drinking, already enrolled in an ongoing study similar to STUDY II, an additional app focused on skills training were investigated (STUDY III). One hundred and eighty six students were randomly assigned to either an intervention group, receiving access to the app immediately, or a waitlist group given access to the app after six weeks. Both groups were compared to each other and also to a group of assessment-only controls (n= 144) from the ongoing study. In the final study, data from 1581 patients having been treated at the internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) clinic in Stockholm, Sweden for major depression, panic disorder or social anxiety disorder, were analyzed to identify the prevalence of problematic substance use at beginning of treatment. The association of problematic substance use with therapy outcomes was also analyzed (STUDY IV) Results: Study I: The guidance group (the secure email messaging and the choice of <b>messaging</b> <b>mode</b> groups were combined) had significantly lowered their alcohol consumption compared to the no-guidance group. Secure email messaging was the preferred mode of communication over chat for the choice group. Participants in the guidance group rated the program more favorably than participants in the no-guidance group. Study II: There were no differences between the apps and assessment-only controls on any alcohol related outcome, but one negative finding for the Promillekoll app, in that men in that group increased their drinking frequency. Study III: Both the intervention and the wait-list had lower proportions of excessive alcohol consumption compared to assessment-only controls at first follow-up. The intervention group lowered their drinking quantity at first follow-up and their drinking frequency at both follow-ups compared to controls. Study IV: Prevalence of problematic substance use was 32. 4 %. Exclusive problematic alcohol use was reported by 24. 1 %, 4. 6 % reported exclusive problematic drug use and 3. 7 % combined problematic alcohol and drug use. Problematic drug use among men and 25 – 34 year olds was associated with completing fewer treatment modules and combined substance use among women and 35 – 64 year olds negatively affected module completion. Baseline problematic substance use was not associated with worse therapy outcomes for patients treated for depression. However, hazardous alcohol use and probable dependence were associated with worse panic disorder treatment outcomes. Hazardous drug use as well as combined problematic alcohol use with either hazardous drug use or probable drug dependence were associated with worse social anxiety disorder outcomes. Conclusion: Using novel communications technology is effective for reaching individuals with problematic substance use. Adding counselor guidance to a web-based relapse prevention program has beneficial effects on problematic drinking. Smartphone apps relying on eBAC feedback do not show much promise at the moment. Skills-training smartphone apps may have a beneficial effect on excessive alcohol consumption. The prevalence of problematic substance use is high in ICBT-treated psychiatric outpatients, but for a variety of levels of baseline substance use, the negative effect on therapy outcomes seems limited...|$|E

Bob combines the photon he receives from Alice with the one he kept, and at a beam splitter (BS), he decodes Alice’s messages. Such messages are said to be sent in a <b>message</b> <b>mode</b> (MM).

40|$|For a {{large number}} of applications, there is a strong need for the {{provision}} of a connectionless service by the B-ISDN. However, the cell-based ATM, which is used for switching and multiplexing in this public telecommunication network, is a connection-oriented technique. The B-ISDN should therefore be extended with functionality to allow for connectionless communications. This dissertation addresses the design and analysis of such an extension. An architectural framework is presented, which places the protocols to be used in perspective. Two possible network architectures result from the functional decomposition of the connectionless service into cooperating protocol entities and the underlying ATM service. In the first one, end-systems of the B-ISDN are interconnected by means of end-to-end ATM connections. In the second one, endsystems are connected to special entities in the B-ISDN, called Connectionless Servers (CLSs). The CLSs are interconnected by ATM connections, thus constituting a connectionless overlay network on top of ATM. A number of different implementation architectures for a CLS are proposed, and analysed with respect to effectiveness, availability, scalability, and in particular, performance. The major distinction between these implementation architectures is the distribution of functionality over modules. Furthermore, two different modes of operation are identified for a CLS. In the <b>message</b> <b>mode</b> of operation, a packet is reassembled from the incoming cells before it is processed and forwarded. In streaming mode of operation, the first cell of a packet is immediately processed and forwarded upon arrival, while state information is maintained for the processing and forwarding of subsequent cells of the packet. A number of performance models are developed in this dissertation. An approximate model of a CLS is analysed to allow for comparison of the delay which is experienced by cells for different implementation architectures and modes of operation. If the bandwidth assigned to ATM connections between CLSs is relatively high, <b>message</b> <b>mode</b> of operation yields the lowest delay, otherwise streaming mode performs best. In order to support the dimensioning of a reassembly buffer in a CLS operating in <b>message</b> <b>mode,</b> another, more detailed model is developed and analysed. It allows the computation of the packet loss probability of a buffer, as a function of its size. An essential function for the provision of a connectionless service using ATM is connection management. This function instructs the signalling system of the B-ISDN to establish and release ATM connections as needed for the transfer of packets. A new mechanism is proposed that exploits the expected correlation between subsequent packet arrivals to reduce the average bandwidth that needs to be reserved by the ATM network. A performance model is developed and analysed to determine the optimal control parameters of the new mechanism, and to evaluate its behaviour. It is shown that bandwidth reductions of up to 95 % can be obtained, compared to conventional mechanisms, without affecting the average delay experienced by packets...|$|R

30|$|Differences in {{conflict}} styles between cultures {{have a significant}} role {{on the performance of}} teams in online environments (Kayworth & Leinder, 2002; Walsh et al. 2003; Yoo & Alavi, 2004). Being prepared for conflicting situations and having some method to deal with them appropriately is the key factor in assuring better solutions, enhanced understanding and trust, improved working relations and cultivated creative thinking (Kollock & Smith, 1996; Williams, 2008; Leung et al. 2011; Lisak & Erez, 2015). In case of a problem or conflict, the facilitator/coach needs to know how to apply constructive conflict management strategies. For this purpose, the facilitator/coach should clarify and address problems, give clear instructions, focus on the issues and work toward solutions.

Eve induces a disturbance (D) only in the control mode (CM) and therefore the standard approach and protocols for estimating and calculating the security are not available since they all assume the presence of D in MM. As a result, a critical D cannot be determined, the standard error correction procedure cannot be applied for elimination of Eve’s information, {{the efficiency of the}} privacy amplification is curtailed, and the unconditional security cannot be considered proved. In a way, Alice’s sending of the key is equivalent to sending an unencrypted plain text “secured” by an unreliable indicator of Eve’s presence and such protocols cannot be considered for implementation at least not before one proves or disproves that a novel kind of security procedures for such deterministic attacks can be designed.|$|R
