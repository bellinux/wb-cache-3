5|$|Basingstoke {{is an old}} <b>market</b> <b>town</b> {{expanded}} in the mid 1960s {{as a result of}} an agreement between London County Council and Hampshire County Council. It was developed rapidly after World War II, along with various other towns in the United Kingdom, in order to accommodate part of the London 'overspill' as perceived under the Greater London Plan in 1944.
