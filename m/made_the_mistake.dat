5|$|Winter, who {{has never}} seen combat, resents the remark. He then takes {{exception}} to what he perceives as Irwin's attempt to change {{the attitudes of the}} prisoners, his admiration for Irwin fading fast. On one occasion, Irwin is punished harshly after stopping a guard from clubbing a prisoner, Corporal Ramon Aguilar (Clifton Collins, Jr.), who had <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of saluting Irwin in the prison yard.|$|E
5|$|Cattle {{were raised}} at the farm. Eisenhower would often poke the rump of a bull with his shotgun {{to show what}} quality of steak the animal would {{eventually}} produce, alarming the Secret Service agents that were protecting him. Once, while barbecuing (something he loved {{to do on the}} farm), he <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of announcing which cow he was cooking. As it had been the favorite cow of his granddaughter Susan Eisenhower, she was brought to tears.|$|E
5|$|González and Olid {{had arrived}} at an uneasy accord, neither wishing to openly clash with the other. However, Olid's men outnumbered those of his rival, and González had <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of {{dividing}} his forces when he had left most of his companions {{on the banks of}} the Dulce river; Olid sent one of his captains, Pedro de Briones, to attack one portion of González' forces, while Olid made ready his ships to sail along the coast and attack other detachments. Briones swiftly weakened González' position and captured about half of his men. At this point, Las Casas' fleet appeared off the coast.|$|E
5000|$|... "Mistakes were made" [...] is an {{expression}} that is commonly used as a rhetorical device, whereby a speaker acknowledges that a situation was handled poorly or inappropriately but seeks to evade any direct admission or accusation of responsibility by not specifying <b>the</b> person who <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistakes.</b> <b>The</b> acknowledgement of [...] "mistakes" [...] is framed in an abstract sense, with no direct reference to who <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistakes.</b> A less evasive construction might be {{along the lines of}} [...] "I made mistakes" [...] or [...] "John Doe <b>made</b> mistakes." [...] <b>The</b> speaker neither accepts personal responsibility nor accuses anyone else. The word [...] "mistakes" [...] also does not imply intent.|$|R
5000|$|... "Mistakes were made" [...] is {{an example}} of {{distancing}} language commonly used as a rhetorical device, whereby a speaker acknowledges that a situation was managed by using low-quality or inappropriate handling but evades any direct admission or accusation of responsibility by not specifying the person or organization who <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistakes.</b> Grammatically, <b>the</b> expression uses the passive voice to focus on the action while omitting the actor. The acknowledgement of [...] "mistakes" [...] is framed in an abstract sense, with no direct reference to who <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistakes.</b> <b>The</b> speaker neither accepts personal responsibility nor accuses anyone else. The word [...] "mistakes" [...] also does not imply intent.

5|$|In early April, Dangić <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of {{travelling}} to Serbia, {{where he}} met one of Nedić's representatives and various other Chetnik leaders, and attended a public rally in Valjevo. Shortly afterwards, Kuntze ordered Dangić's arrest. Dangić was then seized and taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in German-occupied Poland, being replaced by Stevan Botić as the Chetnik commander in eastern Bosnia. Dangić escaped from prison in 1943. The following year he participated in the Warsaw Uprising, an anti-German rebellion {{which resulted in the}} deaths of 18,000 members of the Polish Home Army and over 200,000 Polish civilians.|$|E
5|$|Several other book {{collections}} {{were lost}} as well. Professor Mathias Anchersen <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of bringing his possessions to safety in Trinitatis Church. Árni Magnússon lost all his books, notes and records, but {{did manage to}} rescue his valuable collection of handwritten Icelandic manuscripts. At Borchs Kollegium 3,150volumes burned along with its Museum Rarirorum containing collections of zoological and botanical oddities. The burned out observatory in Rundetårn had contained instruments and records by Tycho Brahe and Ole Rømer. The professors Horrebow, Steenbuch and the two Bartholins lost practically everything. And {{on top of all}} that a large part of the city archive of records burnt along with city hall.|$|E
5|$|That morning, Azmy's paratroopers moved {{south to}} their objectives, {{reaching}} them with relative ease. The 89th Battalion occupied all five strong points between Jebel Mariam and the pumping station. The commander <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of separating his forces equally among all five strong points, rather than concentrating his forces at the southernmost strong points. However, from the rampart at the pumping station, the paratroopers could clearly see the Israeli pontoon bridge at Deversoir, and corrected artillery fire being {{directed against the}} bridge. Second Army's artillery forces continued to fire almost unceasingly until the following day, sometimes scoring hits on the bridge. Egyptian artillery fire against the bridges would inflict heavy casualties on the Israelis {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E

5|$|The borders {{were still}} not {{finalized}} in June 1880 when a proposal very favorable to Greece that included Mount Olympus and Ioannina was {{offered by the}} British and French. When the Ottoman Turks strenuously objected, Prime Minister Trikoupis <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of threatening a mobilization of the Hellenic Army. A coincident change of government in France, the resignation of Charles de Freycinet and his replacement with Jules Ferry, led to disputes among the Great Powers and, despite British support for a more pro-Greek settlement, the Turks subsequently granted Greece all of Thessaly but only the part of Epirus around Arta. When the government of Trikoupis fell, the new prime minister, Alexandros Koumoundouros, reluctantly accepted the new boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Dumouriez {{tried to}} put the {{frontier}} fortresses in the hands of his adherents but failed. Miaczinski botched the attempted seizure of Lille and was later executed. Dumouriez believed that he could control the regular infantry and cavalry regiments. On the other hand, the volunteers and the artillery remained devoted to the National Convention. In one incident, Dumouriez was fired on and nearly arrested by Louis-Nicolas Davout's volunteer battalion. He then <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of being seen with an Austrian escort and the gunners took the lead in refusing to obey him. Seeing that his plot had fallen apart, Dumouriez defected to the Austrians on 5 April 1793. He was accompanied by the Duke of Chartres, Valence, several more generals and some cavalry. No longer bound by the previous agreement, Coburg prepared to invade France.|$|E
5|$|In the Second World War, the 2nd Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment and the 4th Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry held Cassel {{for three}} days {{as part of the}} {{defensive}} screen around Dunkirk during the Battle of Dunkirk and evacuation (27 May 1940 – 30 May 1940). The British forces had prepared a defence on the hilltop, emplacing anti-tank guns and barricading the narrow streets of the town. After scoring initial successes against the tanks of Panzer Regiment 11, which had <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of advancing without infantry support, the British garrison was heavily attacked from the ground and the air by German forces. Much of the town was reduced to ruins by bombing. Most of the garrison's members were killed or captured by the Germans during the fighting or the subsequent attempted breakout towards Dunkirk, but the defence they had put up {{played an important role in}} holding up the Germans while the Dunkirk evacuation was taking place.|$|E

5|$|The Austro-Hungarian assault {{began at}} Lazarevac, a {{strategically}} located town {{just south of}} Belgrade whose capture would have given them access to the Mladenovac railway line {{and the ability to}} outflank the Serbian forces holding the road to Belgrade. Further south, the Austro-Hungarians attacked the Serbian 1st Army. During this assault, they <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of attacking its stronger right flank and were met with determined Serbian resistance which prevented them from gaining any ground. Military historian David Jordan notes that had the Austro-Hungarians attacked the junction splitting the 1st and Užice armies, they {{might have been able to}} split the Serbs down the centre and gotten hold of an unimpeded passage to the Morava River. The Serbian 1st Army was quick to reinforce its left flank, realizing that any subsequent attack against it would be far less easy to repel.|$|E
25|$|Mussolini <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> {{to believe}} that the United Kingdom would accept peace {{agreements}} with the Axis after France's surrender, and did not anticipate a long lasting war. Consequently, Italy entered the war inadequately prepared.|$|E

5000|$|The job in Paris was {{relatively}} simple: {{to use the}} statistical techniques he had learned as a natural historian, studying molluscs, to standardize Cyril Burt's intelligence test for use with French children. Yet without direct supervision, he soon found a remedy to this boring work: exploring why children <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistakes</b> they did. Applying his early training in psychoanalytic interviewing, Piaget began to intervene directly with the children: [...] "Why did you do that?"

25|$|During the 1977 Libyan–Egyptian War, {{there were}} some skirmishes between Libyan and Egyptian fighters. In one instance, two Libyan Air Force MiG-23MS engaged two EAF MiG-21MFs that had been {{upgraded}} to carry Western weaponry. The Libyan pilots <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of trying to manoeuvre with the more nimble Egyptian fighters, and one MiG-23MS was shot down by EAF Maj. Sal Mohammad, while the other Libyan aircraft used its speed advantage to escape.|$|E
25|$|In the Monaco Grand Prix, Montoya did not {{reproduce}} {{his previous}} form {{and had to}} be satisfied with qualifying seventh. In the race, he made one position at the start.
