5|$|In {{the first}} two albums Valérian travels through time in a {{two-seater}} device, the XB27, which transports him to the various relay stations that Galaxity has hidden throughout time (e.g. in Bad Dreams (Les <b>Mauvais</b> Rêves) the relay is hidden below a tavern). In subsequent stories Valérian and Laureline use the saucer-shaped Astroship XB982 (which made its debut appearance in 1969 in the short story The Great Collector (Le Grand Collectionneur). The astroship is able to travel anywhere using a spatio-temporal jump, a sort of hyperspace drive enabling near-instant transportation anywhere in space and time.|$|E
25|$|After 1847, {{the fears}} of the {{chambers}} of commerce in Canada were confirmed, and bankruptcies kept accumulating. Property values were in freefall in the cities, particularly in the capital. In February 1849, the introduction in Parliament of an indemnity bill only aggravated the discontent of {{a part of the}} population who had watched d'un <b>mauvais</b> œil the passing of a series of legislative measures by the reformist majority, which took power in beginning of 1848, about a year before.|$|E
25|$|Back in France, Binoche {{experienced}} {{popular and}} critical success in Paris directed by Cédric Klapisch. Paris is Klapisch's personal ode to the French capital and features an impressive ensemble of French talent, including Romain Duris, Fabrice Luchini and Mélanie Laurent. Paris {{was one of}} the most successful French films internationally in recent years, having grossed over $22million at the world box office. Binoche and Klapisch had originally met on the set of <b>Mauvais</b> Sang in 1986, where Klapisch was working as a set electrician.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{offerings of}} the Vieux-Colombier {{received}} critical and popular acclaim. To no one's surprise The Brothers Karamazov, with Dullin, who finally arrived in New York in March 1918, {{in the role}} of Smerdiakov and later in his well-received role as Harpagon, the miser, counted among the successes. Nuit des rois also burnished the company's reputation. But some plays such as Octave Mirbeau's Les <b>Mauvais</b> Bergers ("The Evil Shepherds") ended with an almost empty house as the audience stalked to the exits during the play before the final curtain.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the years}} Bonarda/Douce noir {{has been known}} {{under a variety of}} {{synonyms}} including: Alcantino, Aleante, Batiolin, Bathiolin (in Albertville), Blaue Gansfuesser, Bonarda (in Argentina), Bourdon noir, Carbonneau, Charbonneau (in Jura), Charbono (in California), Corbeau (in the Ain and Isère departments as well as Jura), Cot Merille, Cot Rouge Merille, Cote Rouge, Dolcetto Grosso, Dolutz, Douce noire, Folle Noire d L'Ariege, Grenoblois, Korbo, <b>Mauvais</b> noir, Ocanette, Picot Rouge, Plant de Calarin, Plant de Montmelion, Plant de Savoie, Plant de Turin (in Jura), Plant noir (in the Haute-Savoie department), Turca (in the Trentino region of Italy), Turin (in Jura) and Turino.|$|E
25|$|The young polemicist persevered in {{supporting}} this anti-establishment cause, moving on from L'Indépendance Roumaine {{to the newly}} established publication România Jună, interrupting himself for trips to Italy, the Netherlands and Galicia-Lodomeria. In 1900, he collected the scattered polemical articles into the French-language books Opinions sincères. La vie intellectuelle des roumains en 1899 ("Honest Opinions. The Romanians' Intellectual Life in 1899") and Opinions pérnicieuses d'un <b>mauvais</b> patriote ("The Pernicious Opinions of a Bad Patriot"). His scholarly activities resulted in a second trip into Transylvania, a second portion of his Bistrița archives collection, the 11th Hurmuzachi volume, and two works on early modern Romanian history: Acte din secolul al XVI-lea relative la Petru Șchiopul ("16th Century Acts Relating to Peter the Lame") and Scurtă istorie a lui Mihai Viteazul ("A Short History of Michael the Brave"). His controversial public attitude had nevertheless attracted an official ban on his Academy reports, and also meant that he was ruled out from the national Academy prize (for which distinction he had submitted Documente românești din arhivele Bistriței). The period also witnessed a chill in the Iorga's relationship with Xenopol.|$|E
500|$|The first Valérian adventure, Les <b>Mauvais</b> Rêves (Bad Dreams) {{appeared}} in Pilote in 1967, {{with the first}} installment of the story published on 9 November in issue 420, and ran for fifteen issues, concluding in issue 434 on 15 February 1968. [...] Bad Dreams shares an artistic style {{similar to that of}} Mézières and Christin's earlier collaborations for Pilote, with influences from Franquin, Morris and Mad magazine artist Jack Davis. Also introduced in this story was Laureline, a peasant girl from the Middle Ages. Originally intended to appear in only one story, the popular reaction to the character meant that she was retained for subsequent stories and she has since become elevated to the main star of the series.|$|E
500|$|Critics pay special {{attention}} to Bette's lack of traditional femininity, and her unconventional relationships with two characters. She is described from the outset as having [...] "des qualités d'homme" [...] ("certain manly qualities"), with similar descriptions elsewhere. Her relationship and attitude toward Steinbock, moreover, hint at her masculinity. She commands him into submission, and even binds him with economic constraints by lending him the money to develop his sculpture. Her domination is tempered by maternal compassion, but the couple's relationship is compared to an abusive marriage: [...] "Il fut comme une femme qui pardonne les <b>mauvais</b> traitements d'une semaine à cause des caresses d'un fugitif raccommodement." [...] ("He was like a woman who forgives a week of ill-usage {{for the sake of a}} kiss and a brief reconciliation.") ...|$|E

2500|$|Ouvrage Latiremont is a gros ouvrage of the Maginot Line, {{located in}} the Fortified Sector of the Crusnes, sub-sector of Arrancy. It lies between the gros ouvrage Fermont and the petit ouvrage <b>Mauvais</b> Bois, facing Belgium. The village of Doncourt-Cités is nearby. Latiremont was active in 1939-1940, coming under direct attack in late June 1940. [...] It {{surrendered}} to German forces on 27 June. [...] After renovations during the Cold War, it was abandoned.|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, Binoche was {{nominated}} for her first César for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her performance in the film. Following Rendez-Vous, she was unsure of what role to take next. She auditioned unsuccessfully for Yves Boisset's Bleu comme l'enfer and Robin Davis's Hors la loi, but was eventually cast in My Brother-in-Law Killed My Sister (1986) by Jacques Rouffio opposite the popular French stars Michel Serrault and Michel Piccoli. This film was a critical and commercial failure. Binoche has commented that Rouffio's film is very significant to her career as it taught her to judge roles based {{on the quality of}} the screenplay and her connection with a director, not on the reputation of other cast members. Later in 1986, she again starred opposite Michel Piccoli in Leos Carax's <b>Mauvais</b> Sang. This film was a critical and commercial success, leading to Binoche's second César nomination. <b>Mauvais</b> Sang is an avant-garde thriller in which she plays Anna the vastly younger lover of Marc (Piccoli) who falls in love with Alex (Denis Lavant), a young thief. Binoche has stated that she, [...] "discovered the camera", while shooting this film.|$|E
2500|$|Ouvrage Bréhain {{is part of}} the Fortified Sector of the Crusnes of the Maginot Line, {{located near}} the {{community}} of Bréhain-la-Ville in the Meurthe-et-Moselle département of France. [...] Bréhain is flanked by petits ouvrages <b>Mauvais</b> Bois and Aumetz. The gros ouvrage was equipped with long-range artillery, and faced the border with Luxembourg. It saw no major action in either the Battle of France in 1940 or the Lorraine Campaign of 1944. While not open to public visitation, it has been secured and is in relatively good condition when compared to other abandoned Maginot positions. A flanking casemate has been restored and may be visited.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{her career}} Binoche has {{intermittently}} appeared on stage, {{most notably in}} a 1998 London production of Luigi Pirandello's Naked and in a 2000 production of Harold Pinter's Betrayal on Broadway for which she {{was nominated for a}} Tony Award. In 2008 she began a world tour with a modern dance production in-i devised in collaboration with Akram Khan. Often referred to as [...] "La Binoche" [...] by the press, her other notable performances include: <b>Mauvais</b> Sang (1986), Les Amants du Pont-Neuf (1991), Damage (1992), The Horseman on the Roof (1995), Code Unknown (2000), Caché (2005), Breaking and Entering (2006), Flight of the Red Balloon (2007), Camille Claudel 1915 (2013) and Clouds of Sils Maria (2014).|$|E
2500|$|Survivors found {{themselves}} stigmatized, often denied {{their rights to}} property and inheritance as well as opportunities for employment. It is estimated by the National Population Office of Rwanda that between 2,000 and 5,000 children were born {{as a result of}} forced impregnation. However, victims groups believe this is underestimated and the number exceeds 10,000. These children are themselves stigmatized and referred to as les enfants <b>mauvais</b> souvenir (children of bad memories) or enfants indésirés (lit. [...] "unwanted children", glossed as [...] "children of hate" [...] by M. Mukangendo). Victims also suffered from survivor's guilt, and anxiety due to their assailants not being held accountable. In 1995, widows of the genocide founded Association des Veuves du Genocide (AVEGA, Widows of the Genocide of April) to see to the needs of female survivors who had been widowed or raped. The extent of the rapes was quickly recognized by human rights groups, with one report, Shattered Lives: Sexual Violence During the Rwandan Genocide and Its Aftermath written by Binaifer Nowrojee, becoming one of the most highly cited human rights reports in up to thirty years.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{suppose they}} {{have told you}} that I am a <b>mauvais</b> sujet." [...] Gyp {{inclined}} her head. He looked at her steadily, and said: [...] "It is true. But I could be better--much." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No fear, vraiment!

60|$|We {{reached the}} {{restaurant}} on the height called the Chapeau {{at four in the}} afternoon. It was a memento-factory, and the stock was large, cheap, and varied. I bought the usual paper-cutter to remember the place by, and had Mont Blanc, the <b>Mauvais</b> Pas, {{and the rest of the}} region branded on my alpenstock; then we descended to the valley and walked home without being tied together. This was not dangerous, for the valley was five miles wide, and quite level.|$|E
