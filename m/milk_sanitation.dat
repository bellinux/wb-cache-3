40|$|Major {{expansion}} of the dairy industry {{has occurred in the}} last 12 years in North Central Texas, especially in Erath County. For several decades, this area has been the location of small dairy farms with sufficient land to maintain low animal densities on pastures except during milking operations. Today, however, new dairy operations are typically much larger (500 - 1, 000 or more head) and maintain milking and dry cattle in open lots or corrals on small areas relative to the number of cows, {{in a manner that is}} similar to practices in the desert Southwest. Typical animal spacings in open lots are 56 m 2 (600 square feet) pa cow. Large amounts of water are used for manure removal and <b>milk</b> <b>sanitation,</b> resulting in significant volumes of process-generated wastewater. Concern has increased regarding the potential for ground and surface water quality degradation due to the increasing number and size of open lot dairies, particularly in the Upper North Bosque River watershed (Erath and Hamilton Counties, Texas). The outcropping of the Paluxy Formation within the watershed, which acts as a recharge zone for the Trinity Aquifer group, has led to concern about the quality of ground water in the watershed. The Upper North Bosque River (stream segment 1226) flows through the center of Erath County and eventually enters a municipal water supply reservoir before entering the Brazos River at Waco. This stream segment has been characterized as the state's major "known problem" for agricultural nonpoint source water quality pursuant to 1988 and 1990 assessments under Section 319 of the Federal Clean Water Act (TWC, 1988). Animal confinement operations, specifically dairy operations, were identified as primary contributors to the problem. A number of interagency research and demonstration projects have been initiated since 1988 in response to the concerns about water quality degradation due to open lot dairies. A common goal of these projects is to obtain and disseminate data and information related to the design and evaluation of dairy waste management practices. The results of these studies will aid producers, engineers, planners, and regulatory officials in the refinement and adoption of appropriate practices for water quality protection...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} was {{developed}} to quantify bacteria on bovine teats prior to milking. Previous methods using swabs to recover bacteria from teat skin have shown {{a high degree of}} variability in the amount of bacteria recovered depending on the amount of pressure applied to the teat/swab interface, the variability in the surface area of the teat swabbed, and the choice of the area to swab as the entire teat surface cannot be practically swabbed. This new method uses a single towel moistened with water to recover soil and bacteria from all four teats of each individual cow. Bacteria are then recovered from the towel and suspended in a sterile water solution. This solution is then cultured and tested using direct microscopic methods. Data are presented from several case studies which were designed to detect differences between different bedding management strategies on the bacteria population on the teats of cows as they entered the milking parlor as well as to detect the efficacy of pre <b>milking</b> teat <b>sanitation</b> in both conventional and automatic (robotic) milking facilities...|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of people are consuming raw unpasteurizedmilk. Enhanced nutritional qualities, taste, and health benefits have all been advocated as reasons for increased interest in raw milk consumption. However, science-based data to substantiate these claims are limited. People continue to consume raw milk even though numerous epidemiological studies have shown clearly that raw milk can be contaminated by a variety of path-ogens, some of which are associated with human illness and disease. Several documented milkborne disease outbreaks occurred from 2000 – 2008 and were traced back to consumption of raw unpasteurized milk. Numerous people were found to have infections, some were hospitalized, and a few died. In the majority of these outbreaks, the organism associated with the milkborne outbreak was isolated from the implicated product(s) or from sub-sequent products made at the suspected dairy or source. In contrast, fewer milkborne disease outbreaks were associated with consumption of pasteurized milk during this same time period. Twenty nine states allow the sale of raw milk by some means. Direct purchase, cow-share or leasing programs, and the sale of raw milk as pet food have been used asmeans for consumers to obtain rawmilk. Where rawmilk is offered for sale, strategies to reduce risks associated with raw milk and products made from raw milk are needed. Developing uniform regulations including microbial standards for raw milk to be sold for human consumption, labeling of raw <b>milk,</b> improving <b>sanitation</b> during <b>milking,</b> and enhancing and targeting educational efforts are potential approaches to this issue. Development of pre- and postharvest control measures to effectively reduce contamination is critical to the control of pathogens in raw milk.

A separate analysis for each independent variable identified many potential disease determinants. A multivariable analysis of a covariance model to predict the prevalence of coliforms had 6 model df (R 2 =. 47). Increased prevalence of coliform infection was associated with an increased amount of milk remaining in the udder after milking, use of free stalls, regular use of a running water wash, increased person hours per cow spent <b>milking,</b> and poor <b>sanitation.</b> The multivariable model for environmental streptococci used 5 model df (R 2 =. 51).

40|$|International audienceStaphylococci are {{the main}} {{aetiological}} agents of small ruminants intramammary infections (IMI), the more frequent isolates being S. aureus in clinical cases and coagulase negative species in subclinical IMI. The clinical IMI, whose annual incidence is usually lower than 5 %, mainly occur {{at the beginning of}} machine milking and during the first third of lactation. These features constitute small ruminant peculiarities compared to dairy cattle. Small ruminant mastitis is generally a chronic and contagious infection: the primary sources are mammary and cutaneous carriages, and spreading mainly occurs during milking. Somatic cell counts (SCC) represent a valuable tool for prevalence assessment and screening, but predictive values are better in ewes than in goats. Prevention is most often based on <b>milking</b> machine management, <b>sanitation</b> and annual control, and milking technique optimisation. Elimination mainly relies on culling animals exhibiting clinical, chronic and recurrent IMI, and on drying-off intramammary antibiotherapy; this treatment allows a good efficacy and may be used selectively by targeting infected udders only. Heritability values for lactation mean SCC scores are between 0. 11 and 0. 15. Effective inclusion of ewe's mastitis resistance in the breeding goal has recently been implemented in France following experimental and large scale estimations of genetic parameters for SCC scores...|$|R

40|$|Western nations {{experienced}} dramatic {{declines in}} mortality levels {{during the course}} of industrialization. Attempts to identify the specific processes influencing the nature of these declines have put forward a range of possible factors, which are both numerous and complex. One means of attempting to disentangle these relationships is to focus analysis on selected populations in a single area. Locally-specific studies can provide important detail on the determinants of changes in mortality. Such detail, in conjunction with broader theories based on a national or regional scope, provides an important balance in understanding the mortality transition. ^ This study examines the determinants of early childhood mortality in Philadelphia during the late nineteenth century. Information available for this city provides the opportunity to create a fairly detailed picture of the hazards and advantages of urban life for young children during this period. More specifically these data support a variety of methods for examining the general determinants of early childhood mortality patterns in the city, including both cross-sectional and temporal variations in mortality. ^ During the period of study, many causes of death were ill-defined and {{a large portion of the}} decline cannot be attributed to causes that were diagnosed with great specificity. Among older children, significant portions of the decline could be linked to infectious diseases with specific diagnoses. For younger children, the data point toward the importance of diarrheal disease, which exhibited a highly seasonal pattern dominated by summer mortality. ^ This analysis focuses on summer diarrheal mortality. A striking pattern of summer mortality was quite pronounced in the late nineteenth century for infants and one year olds, disappearing in the second decade of the twentieth century. For the period 1860 to 1880, one year olds displayed a decline in summer mortality, while the indices for infants actually increased. Following a period of no decline for either age group between 1880 and 1895, summer mortality began its final stage of decline for infants and one year olds. The relative contributions of breastfeeding, weaning, supplemental foods, water and <b>milk</b> supplies, <b>sanitation</b> and urban infrastructure and public health activities to these observed declines are examined. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{performance}} characteristics of dairy farms from zootechnical data. The studied farms characterised as qualified, average and unqualified by a multiple-response test analysing {{a set of}} algorythmic rules based on zootechnical data: - farm size, - animal housing and - milking mechanisation. Other studied data regarding animal nutrition, animal husbandry and animal health will be published later. The parameters of farm size included: - number of dairy cows, - area of cultivated land, - milk production per farm, - genetic selection for milk yield, and - artificial insemination. The parameters of animal housing were - type of barn, - type of barn floor, - storage for feed materials, - infirmary unit, - barn structure for natural ventilation, and - provision of drinking water. The parameters of milking mechanisation were - type of milking device and way of milking, - calibration of <b>milking</b> device, - <b>sanitation,</b> - pre-milking, and - hygiene before and after milking. The applicability {{and validity of the}} results obtained from the multiple-response test were made by the comparisons with the results obtained from the average statistics applied to the same data. The mode statistic, but not the mean statistic meets the terms of results obtained from the multiple-response test for the characterisation of farms within each of three sets of zootechnical data. The method of multi-response analysis determining the level of farmer's qualification in a sustainable dairy farming was remarkably reproducible. The overall results indicated that 27 % of farms were qualified, 38 % were averaged and 35 % were unqualified farms in the activity of sustainable dairy farming. These figures were discussed with previous findings. The way of present classification helps the regional policy makers to efficiently provide the milk services.

Suspension of enterococci (8 log CFU. ml - 1) was prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), PBS with content 0. 1 % and 1 % of skimmed reconstituted milk. Glass plates were immersed into bacterial suspension for 1 h at 37 °C. The number of enterococci adhered on glass surface in PBS achieved an average value 3. 47 log CFU. mm - 2, in PBS with 0. 1 % of milk 2. 90 CFU. mm - 2, in PBS with 1 % of milk 2. 63 CFU. mm - 2. Differences between the tested files {{were not statistically significant}} (p > 0. 05). In the second part of work the glass plates with adhered enterococci were exposed to the effect of alkaline sanitizer (on basis of NaOH and NaClO), respectively acidic sanitizer (on basis of H 3 PO 4).

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 The dairy {{industry}} {{has indicated that}} milk hauling sporadically compromises milk quality, but often the reason is unknown. Milk hauling practices are an underexplored area of research, and {{are in need of}} attention because during hauling milk is most exposed to the external environment in comparison with any other step of modern dairy processing. Milk hauling is defined as the activities associated with the transfer of raw milk from producer to tanker truck, which is then transported and unloaded into storage silos at a processing facility. Tanker are often used to haul several loads within a 24 -h period without cleaning and sanitizing in between; a practice that is mandated by the Grade “A” Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (PMO). Repeated tanker usage between cleans is necessary in the modern {{dairy industry}}; less cleaning reduces chemical and water usage, and time. There is no specification on maximum loads hauled or idle time (empty and dirty) between loads. Additionally, many routine practices outlined in the PMO use vague wording (as needed) to describe frequency; this is to provide flexibility to industry since each facility is unique. However, this vagueness does not inform industry on what best practices entail; potentially leading to unexplained sources of contamination due to weaknesses in practices. 	The overarching hypothesis of our research is that <b>milk</b> hauling <b>sanitation</b> and operation practices have the potential to negatively contribute to the microbiological quality of raw milk and impact finished product quality. In the scope of our study, negative impact from hauling is defined as an increase in microbiological counts or microflora proteolytic and lipolytic enzyme activity. The aim of our research was to explore a vast range of hauling situations to see if they had potential to compromise raw milk quality; this was achieved by i) characterizing variability in industry hauling sanitation and operational practices, ii) identifying circumstances in which hauling contributes to a degradation in the microbiological quality of raw milk by analyzing two years of historic raw milk microbiological data from producers and tanker trucks of a Northwest co-op. and iii) investigating impact of worst-case hauling conditions (e. g. extended idle time between loads) by measuring raw milk microbiological counts and enzyme activity for two scenarios: a) a small-scale using stainless steel milk cans, b) commercial study using tanker trucks and a pre-selected route. As anticipated, variability in industry practices exists, especially for equipment that required manual cleaning, and preventative maintenance programs such as replacement of aged equipment and parts. Analysis of historic raw milk microbial counts indicated that microbiological counts were not likely to be influenced by hauling, but rather are influenced by on-farm milk quality. Low counts from the on-farm bulk tank will be maintained if best sanitation and operating practices implemented at every step of the process, including milk hauling. Our small-scale milk can study demonstrated that extended idle time (> 6 hours) between loads has potential to negatively impacts milk quality, and provided a proof-of-concept for scaling up to a commercial study. Negative impact on milk quality was demonstrated to not be measurable for commercial tankers remaining dirty and idle for periods of < 6 h between loads. Current PMO regulations (clean per 24 hours) appears to be adequate as long best sanitation and operation practices are implement. Future advances in rapid microbiological testing may facilitate better methods for measuring raw milk quality, especially as we better understand influences of raw milk microflora on downstream quality of dairy products...|$|R
40|$|In this issue: Field {{training}} {{activities of the}} Communicable Disease Center. The Communicable Disease Center, with a background of successful achievements in training workers for the fields of malaria and rodent-borne disease control, has established several regional field-training centers during 1946, 1947, and 1948, in order to more effectively assist all the States with practical training (internship type) of public health personnel. These regional training centers established through the cooperative effort of State and local health departments are located as follows: Southeastern section of U. S. -Atlanta, Columbus, Albany, and Savannah, Ga.; Northeastern section of U. S. - Albany and Troy, N. Y.; Midwestern section of U. S. - Cincinnati, Ohio, and Topeka, Kans.; Western or Rocky Mountain section - Denver, Colo. Presented in this Bullet in are short summaries -prepared by Training Division training officers- of field training courses carried on during the past 2 years. Reference to these articles will develop the point that this practical training falls into two categories. (l) In-service training for CDC personnel; and insect and rodent control training for foreign visitors who have taken academic courses at the universities here in the United States, and who desire {{to participate in the}} application of these public health principles about which they have studied. (2) Field training of both professional and nonprofessional personnel for nearly all types of workers employed by local, State, or Federal health authorities. These include health officers, sanitary engineers, sanitarians (professional grade), and health educators; and in the nonprofessional category, sanitary inspectors, sanitarians for <b>milk</b> and food <b>sanitation</b> control, rodent- and insect-borne disease control, and public health department records personnel. The field training centers have been strategically located with the thought of using them as focal points from which assistance in training could be rendered to States that already have established, or intend to develop, field training facilities of their own. Many States, including Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, Texas, California, and Michigan, have developed, with financial assistance from certain foundations, effective field-{{training activities}}. Others {{are in the process of}} doing so. It is the aim of the Training Division to help all the States- by loan of personnel and by furnishing training aids such as motion pictures, film strips, manuals, and equipment- to develop the most essential facilities, in order that these 50, 000 people mentioned by Dr. Scheele may be quickly trained and started on their important work of preventing disease through well-conceived and efficiently executed programs in local health departments. In the following brief summaries, several of the training officers at headquarters of the Training Division in Atlanta and at regional training centers throughout the country have outlined the organization and conduct of the different types of field training. It cannot be too strongly emphasized that without the sympathetic and enthusiastic support of the directors of these local and State health departments where training activities are under way, no effective field training can be carried on by the Public Health Service.
