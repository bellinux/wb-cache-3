His granddaughter, Stella, who wrote a biography about him in 2001, said, [...] "He did not know that he had cancer, and {{he did not want to}} know. He did not ask <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>this.</b> He was first hospitalized in 1999. My grandfather went through with treatment, but he did not want to know anything about the illness. He acted with serenity every day, and because of that, we respected this wish." ...|$|E

A place that has left its mark on the world's imagination and a place where dreams can actually come true. I made this short film so I could share my thoughts on this incredibly special place and talk to others about theirs. It's not so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> particular city but more {{about the people who}} inhabit it." [...] He further said, [...] "It's a story about hope and dreams. It's a story about people making the impossible possible—whether it's Kanye West, James Franco, or a kid who's living on the streets on Hollywood Boulevard. It's a story about survival and about what it takes to become who you really want to be." ...|$|E

500|$|Mirroring the {{deliberately}} vague detail {{within the}} novel, the blurb {{on the book}} is unusually written, in {{that it does not}} name the characters or reveal the plot. It was written by a team at Sceptre led by marketing consultant Damian Horner, and has the approval of Cleave, who described it as [...] "genius". Cleave explained: [...] "I think readers are quite smart and don't really need the whole thing spelt out for them in a plot summary. It's nice to let them discover the book at their own speed. And the technique of the book is to release these dirty secrets gradually." [...] The content of the blurb varies between UK and American editions of the novel, but both begin: [...] "We don't want to tell you too <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> book. It is a truly special story and we don't want to spoil it." [...] and end: [...] "Once you have read it, you'll want to tell everyone about it. When you do, please don't tell them what happens either. The magic is in how it unfolds." [...] James Spackman, Sales and Marketing Director for Sceptre, was initially sceptical of the blurb, particularly disliking the use of [...] "we" [...] for the publisher to address the reader directly. Once the book became a best-seller, however, he revised his stance, and now believes that the reason the blurb works is because it makes a virtue of denying the reader information, with an unusual format and [...] "arrestingly direct" [...] tone. The blurb won Sceptre the [...] "Best Blurb" [...] award at the 2010 Book Marketing Society Awards.|$|E

Bjelland commented on the event, saying: “I don’t know how I’ve progressed musically as such but a major influence in my writing was dealing with my whole schizophrenia episode. I actually haven’t spoken to anyone <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>this.</b> Dealing with multiple personalities was extremely difficult because some days I didn't know who I was or where I was at. I was very lucky that Adrian stuck by and helped me through it all. So obviously {{that was going to}} affect some of what I wrote about."

2500|$|Glass Wings has {{received}} several primarily negative reviews from English-speaking audiences. Writing for IGN, A.E. Sparrow comments that the [...] "stunning artwork will captivate" [...] readers, {{but that the}} book suffers from [...] "muddled dialogue" [...] and sound-effect balloons that intrude on the book's flow. Julie Rosato of Mania praises the art of Glass Wings, though she notes that the [...] "crammed pages {{made it hard to}} enjoy the character detail and almost impossible to appreciate the various emotional dynamics." [...] She criticizes the Tsubaki plotline as [...] "disjointed" [...] and the conflicts as [...] "un-relatable" [...] because of the [...] "fantastical-horror angle". She states that [...] "too <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> book moves too fast, and with too little emotional impact", leaving the reader without concern for the characters, and therefore unaffected by the stories' tragic ends. School Library Journals John Leighton states that [...] "the artwork is overdone with each figure too stylized and each article of clothing bejeweled to the max." [...] He concludes that Glass Wings [...] "has promise but never really takes off." [...] Wilma Jandoc and Jason S. Yadao, writing for Honolulu Star-Bulletin, noted it [...] "offers such a visual overload that it's easy to lose track of what's happening" [...] and that it [...] "is difficult to discern the flow of action". Its bleak endings was cited as [...] "even more difficult to digest".|$|E
