5|$|Tics are sudden, repetitive, nonrhythmic {{movements}} (motor tics) and utterances (phonic tics) {{that involve}} discrete muscle groups. Motor tics are movement-based tics, while phonic tics are involuntary sounds produced by <b>moving</b> <b>air</b> through the nose, mouth, or throat.|$|E
5|$|A {{second factor}} which {{contributes}} to a concentrated jet, that is more applicable to the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is significant. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward <b>moving</b> <b>air</b> implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E
25|$|In October 2006 Dyson {{launched}} the Dyson Airblade, a fast hand dryer {{that uses a}} thin sheet of <b>moving</b> <b>air</b> as a squeegee to remove water, rather than attempting to evaporate it with heat. This allows faster drying, while using much less energy than traditional electrical hand dryers.|$|E

25|$|In {{its most}} basic sense, {{respiration}} {{is the process of}} <b>moving</b> <b>air</b> {{in and out of the}} body—inhalation and exhalation. Breathing for singing and speaking is a more controlled process than is the ordinary breathing used for sustaining life. The controls applied to exhalation are particularly important in good vocal technique.|$|E
25|$|Phonic tics are {{involuntary}} sounds {{produced by}} <b>moving</b> <b>air</b> through the nose, mouth, or throat. They may be alternately {{referred to as}} verbal tics or vocal tics, but most diagnosticians prefer the term phonic tics to reflect {{the notion that the}} vocal cords are not involved in all tics that produce sound.|$|E
25|$|Soaring: gliding in rising or {{otherwise}} <b>moving</b> <b>air</b> that requires specific physiological and morphological adaptations that can sustain the animal aloft without flapping its wings. The rising air {{is due to}} thermals, ridge lift or other meteorological features. Under the right conditions, soaring creates a gain of altitude without expending energy. Large wingspans are needed for efficient soaring.|$|E
50|$|A {{wet bulb}} {{temperature}} taken with <b>air</b> <b>moving</b> at about 1-2 m/s {{is referred to as}} a screen temperature, whereas a temperature taken with <b>air</b> <b>moving</b> about 3.5 m/s or more is referred to as sling temperature.|$|R
50|$|The {{energy source}} for {{baroclinic}} instability {{is the potential}} energy in the environmental flow. As the instability grows, the center of mass of the fluid is lowered. In growing waves in the atmosphere, cold <b>air</b> <b>moving</b> downwards and equatorwards displaces the warmer <b>air</b> <b>moving</b> polewards and upwards.|$|R
50|$|A ball <b>moving</b> through <b>air</b> {{experiences}} {{two major}} aerodynamic forces, lift and drag. Dimpled balls fly farther than non-dimpled balls {{due to the}} combination of these two effects.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the drone}} is highly {{specialized}} to perform one function, mating and continuing {{the propagation of}} the hive, it is not completely without side benefit to the hive. All bees, when they sense the hive's temperature deviating from proper limits, either generate heat by shivering, or exhaust heat by <b>moving</b> <b>air</b> with their wings—behaviours which drones share with worker bees.|$|E
25|$|Officers {{may carry}} either a CS or PAVA (also known as Captor) incapacitant spray. Their effects are {{designed}} to be short-lived and exposure to fresh <b>moving</b> <b>air</b> will normally result in a significant recovery within 15–20 minutes. The CS spray issued by UK police services contains a 5% solution of CS whilst Captor sprays contain a 0.3% solution of PAVA. It should be noted that PAVA is significantly more potent than CS.|$|E
25|$|To {{accurately}} {{predict what}} UV dose {{will be delivered}} to the target the UV intensity, adjusted for distance, coating and end of lamp life, will be multiplied by the exposure time. In static applications the exposure time can be as long as needed for an effective UV dose to be reached. In case of rapidly <b>moving</b> <b>air,</b> in AC air ducts for example, the exposure time is short so the UV intensity must be increased by introducing multiple UV lamps or even banks of lamps. Also, the UV installation must be located in a long straight duct section with the lamps perpendicular to the air flow to maximize the exposure time.|$|E

25|$|The way windcatchers work is {{that the}} <b>moving</b> <b>air</b> masses (wind, breeze, etc.) {{at the top of}} windcatchers create a {{pressure}} gradient between the top of the windcatcher and its base, inside, {{at the bottom of the}} shaft. This pressure gradient sucks out rising hot air from inside the shaft while the colder dense air remains. The superb heat-resistant material of the walls of the ab anbar further create an insulating effect that tends to lower the temperature inside an ab anbar, similar to a cave. The ventilating effect of the windcatchers prevent any stagnant air and hence any dew or humidity from forming inside, and the overall effect is pure, clean, cold water all year round.|$|E
25|$|The Tropical {{continental}} airmass (CT) finally retreats {{from most}} part of Nigeria, and the West African atmosphere around April to May, leaving an empty atmosphere over Nigeria. The sun's rays enters {{into the atmosphere}} of Nigeria more intense than it does during {{the presence of the}} Tropical continental airmass, which contained dust (in form of haze) that reduced the intensity of the sun. The overheating of the west Africa land mass and Nigeria in particular creates a low pressure region over west Africa and Nigeria. This low pressure zone attracts the Tropical Maritime Airmass (MT) from the south Atlantic Ocean since areas of low pressures experiences inward blowing winds because winds are <b>moving</b> <b>air</b> blowing outwards from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure.|$|E
25|$|Air {{circulation}} rate: Drying {{time and}} timber quality {{depend on the}} air velocity and its uniform circulation. At a constant temperature and relative humidity, the highest possible drying rate is obtained by rapid circulation of air {{across the surface of}} wood, giving rapid removal of moisture evaporating from the wood. However, a higher drying rate is not always desirable, particularly for impermeable hardwoods, because higher drying rates develop greater stresses that may cause the timber to crack or distort. At very low fan speeds, less than 1m/s, the air flow through the stack is often laminar flow, and the heat transfer between the timber surface and the <b>moving</b> <b>air</b> stream is not particularly effective (Walker et al., 1993). The low effectiveness (externally) of heat transfer is not necessarily a problem if internal moisture movement is the key limitation to the movement of moisture, as it is for most hardwoods (Pordage and Langrish, 1999).|$|E
50|$|ANSI/AMCA Standard 210 - Laboratory Methods of Testing Fans for Certified Aerodynamic Performance Rating {{establishes}} uniform {{test methods}} for a laboratory {{test of a}} fan or other <b>air</b> <b>moving</b> device to determine its aerodynamic performance in terms of airflow rate, pressure developed, power consumption, air density, speed of rotation, and efficiency for rating or guarantee purposes. It applies to a fan or other <b>air</b> <b>moving</b> device when <b>air</b> is used as the test gas with the following exceptions: (a) air circulating fans (ceiling fans, desk fans); (b) positive pressure ventilators; (c) compressors with inter-stage cooling; (d) positive displacement machines; (e) test procedures {{to be used for}} design, production, or field testing.|$|R

50|$|The {{reason that}} spin on a {{football}} makes it curl {{is known as the}} Magnus effect. This causes a rotating ball to form a whirlpool about itself, with one side's <b>air</b> <b>moving</b> with the ball and the other side's <b>air</b> <b>moving</b> against the ball. This creates a difference in air pressure, and the ball deviates from its path as a result of this.|$|R
25|$|In February 2010, Dr. Cheryl K. Crawley, Great Falls Public Schools Superintendent, {{established}} {{a task force}} to study the physical plant at GFHS. The task force's charge is to recommend improvements and changes to the buildings, grounds, and physical plant of the high school so that the school can continue to provide a high-quality education while remaining at near-capacity in terms of enrollment. Dr. Crawley's report noted that GFHS currently has dining facilities too small for the size of the student body; requires students, faculty, staff, and the public to walk outdoors during winter weather to move between buildings (a safety hazard); does not integrate the South Campus with the Upper Campus; lacks an adequate HVAC system (particularly in moving fresh air into the interior, as well as <b>moving</b> <b>air</b> around inside the building); cannot accommodate high-bandwidth computer or phone lines; and has poor cell phone, television, and radio reception. The building also lacks zoned heat regulation, which makes some areas of the building too hot and others too cold and reduces energy efficiency. School officials also say the Old Gym HVAC system is not functioning well, there are aging light fixtures throughout the building, and the hallways on the second and third floors are dark. Additionally, student traffic flows throughout the building are poor (especially in the skywalk leading to the industrial arts annex), and the industrial arts annex suffers from safety problems.|$|E

500|$|The {{same effect}} also occurs over bodies of salt water, {{when it is}} termed ocean-effect or bay-effect snow. [...] The effect is {{enhanced}} when the <b>moving</b> <b>air</b> mass is uplifted by the orographic influence of higher elevations on the downwind shores.

500|$|Lake-effect snow is {{produced}} in the winter {{in the shape of}} one or more elongated bands when cold winds move across long expanses of warmer lake water, providing energy and picking up water vapor which freezes and is deposited on the lee shores. [...] The same effect over bodies of salt water is called ocean effect snow, sea effect snow, or even bay effect snow. [...] The effect is enhanced when the <b>moving</b> <b>air</b> mass is uplifted by the orographic effect of higher elevations on the downwind shores. [...] This uplifting can produce narrow, but very intense bands of precipitation, which is deposited at a rate of many inches of snow per hour and often brings copious snowfall totals. [...] The areas affected by lake-effect snow are called snowbelts. This effect occurs in many locations throughout the world, but is best known in the populated areas of the Great Lakes of North America.|$|E
