40|$|Overweight {{and obesity}} {{lead to an}} {{increased}} risk for <b>metabolic</b> <b>disorders</b> such as impaired glucose regulation/insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Several molecular drug targets with potential to prevent or treat <b>metabolic</b> <b>disorders</b> have been revealed. Interestingly, the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), which belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily, has many beneficial clinical effects. PPAR directly modulates gene expression by binding to a specific ligand. All PPAR subtypes (ÃŽÂ±,ÃŽÂ³, and ÃÂƒ) are involved in glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and energy balance. PPAR agonists {{play an important role}} in therapeutic aspects of <b>metabolic</b> <b>disorders.</b> However, undesired effects of the existing PPAR agonists have been reported. A great deal of recent research has focused on the discovery of new PPAR modulators with more beneficial effects and more safety without producing undesired side effects. Herein, we briefly review the roles of PPAR in <b>metabolic</b> <b>disorders,</b> the effects of PPAR modulators in <b>metabolic</b> <b>disorders,</b> and the technologies with which to discover new PPAR modulators...|$|R

25|$|GM2-gangliosidosis, AB variant is a rare, {{autosomal}} recessive <b>metabolic</b> <b>disorder</b> that causes progressive destruction of nerve {{cells in the}} brain and spinal cord. Mutations in the GM2A gene cause AB variant. The GM2A gene provides instructions for making a protein called the GM2 activator. This protein is a cofactor that is required for the normal function of beta-hexosaminidase A. The disease is usually fatal by early childhood.|$|E

25|$|Sandhoff {{disease is}} a rare, {{autosomal}} recessive <b>metabolic</b> <b>disorder</b> that causes progressive destruction of nerve cells {{in the brain and}} spinal cord. The disease results from mutations on chromosome 5 in the HEXB gene, critical for the lysosomal enzymes beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A and B. Sandhoff Disease is clinically indistinguishable from Tay-Sachs Disease. The most common form, infantile Sandhoff disease, is usually fatal by early childhood.|$|E
25|$|In January 2010, Dr Vito Franco, {{professor}} of pathological anatomy at Palermo University, published research {{in an article}} in La Stampa newspaper and at a medical conference in Florence which suggested that the subject showed clear signs of xanthelasma, small accumulations of cholesterol-rich material under the skin, perhaps caused by problems in her biliary tract, due to hyperlipidemia, an inherited <b>metabolic</b> <b>disorder.</b> Dr Franco also suggested that she shows signs of having a lipoma behind her right eye.|$|E
25|$|GM2-gangliosidosis, AB variant is a rare, {{autosomal}} recessive <b>metabolic</b> <b>disorder</b> that causes progressive destruction of nerve {{cells in the}} brain and spinal cord. It has a similar pathology to Sandhoff disease and Tay-Sachs disease. The three diseases are classified together as the GM2 gangliosidoses, because each disease represents a distinct molecular point of failure in the activation of the same enzyme, beta-hexosaminidase. AB variant is caused by a failure in the gene that makes an enzyme cofactor for beta-hexosaminidase, called the GM2 activator.|$|E

25|$|Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, {{also called}} {{erythrocyte}} pyruvate kinase deficiency, is an inherited <b>metabolic</b> <b>disorder</b> of the enzyme pyruvate kinase. In this condition, {{a lack of}} pyruvate kinase slows down the process of glycolysis. This effect is especially devastating in cells that lack mitochondria, because these cells must use anaerobic glycolysis as their sole source of energy because the TCA cycle is not available. One example is red blood cells, which {{in a state of}} pyruvate kinase deficiency rapidly become deficient in ATP and can undergo hemolysis. Therefore, pyruvate kinase deficiency can cause hemolytic anemia.|$|E
25|$|Trimethylaminuria (TMAU; primary trimethylaminuria), {{also known}} as fish odor {{syndrome}} or fish malodor syndrome, is a rare <b>metabolic</b> <b>disorder</b> that causes a defect in the normal production of an enzyme named flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). When FMO3 is not working correctly or if not enough enzyme is produced, the body loses the ability to properly convert trimethylamine (TMA) from precursor compounds in food digestion into trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), through a process called N-oxidation. Trimethylamine then builds up and is released in the person's sweat, urine, and breath, giving off a strong fishy odor or strong body odor. A variant of TMAU (secondary trimethylaminuria or TMAU2) exists {{where there is no}} genetic cause, yet excessive TMA is secreted, possibly due to intestinal dysbiosis, altered metabolism, or hormonal causes.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{toxicity}} {{can occur}} from excessive supplement use, eating acid foods cooked in uncoated copper cookware, exposure to excess copper in drinking water, {{or as the}} result of an inherited <b>metabolic</b> <b>disorder</b> in the case of Wilson's disease. A significant portion of the toxicity of copper comes from its ability to accept and donate single electrons as it changes oxidation state. This catalyzes the production of very reactive radical ions, such as hydroxyl radical {{in a manner similar to}} Fenton chemistry. This catalytic activity of copper is used by the enzymes with which it is associated, thus is only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated. This increase in unmediated reactive radicals is generally termed oxidative stress, and is an active area of research in a variety of diseases where copper may play an important but more subtle role than in acute toxicity.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{findings}} suggest that PLSCR3 and, to a lesser degree, PLSCR1 are critical to the normal regulation of fat accumulation in mice. In addition to blood cells, PLSCR3 is expressed to a significantly higher level in fat and muscle cells, which are actively involved in fat metabolism. PLSCR3 knockout mice showed an aberrant abdominal fat accumulation, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and dyslipidema as compared to controlled mice. Cultured fat cells from PLSCR3 knockout mice were engorged with neutral lipids. Blood plasma of these mice showed elevated levels of non-high-density lipoproteins, cholesterol, triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids, and leptin, but low adiponectin content. Abdominal fat accumulation {{with the formation of}} enlarged lipid engorged adipocytes has emerged as the key risk factor for the onset of type 2 diabetes, which is often a manifestation of a broader underlying <b>metabolic</b> <b>disorder</b> termed as metabolic syndrome. Further studies on the regulation of lipid metabolism by PLSCRs are required to understand the risk for development of similar diseases in humans when PLSCR genes are mutated, leading to a defective expression and/or function of PLSCR proteins.|$|E
500|$|Controlled {{trials have}} now shown {{unequivocally}} that consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages increases body weight and body fat, and that replacement of sugar by artificial sweeteners reduces weight. Studies on {{the link between}} sugars and diabetes are inconclusive, with some suggesting that eating excessive amounts of sugar does not {{increase the risk of}} diabetes, although the extra calories from consuming large amounts of sugar can lead to obesity, which may itself increase the risk of developing this <b>metabolic</b> <b>disorder.</b> [...] Other studies show correlation between refined sugar (also called [...] "free sugar") consumption and the onset of diabetes, and negative correlation with the consumption of fiber. These included a 2010 meta-analysis of eleven studies involving 310,819 participants and 15,043 cases of type2 diabetes.|$|E

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} The {{everyday}} use of targeted therapies, whose mechanisms of action {{differ from the}} conventional cytotoxic agents, also causes {{the emergence of new}} toxicities as <b>metabolic</b> <b>disorders</b> about which little is known. We propose a systematic literature review of the incidence and physiopathology of targeted therapies-induced <b>metabolic</b> <b>disorders</b> and provide some management guidance. Recent findings In recent decades, significant breakthroughs in molecular oncology and immunology have been made. The administration of targeted therapies and immunotherapy has been associated with metabolic toxicities such as endocrine disorders, dyslipidemia, induced diabetes, and electrolytic disorders. Current data show that <b>metabolic</b> <b>disorders</b> are becoming increasingly common, but rarely life threatening and often reversible with prompt therapeutic intervention. Summary In the era of targeted therapies, medical oncologists should know the symptoms, carefully monitor patients for potential <b>metabolic</b> <b>disorders,</b> and manage these emerging side-effects with the help of endocrinologists and other medical specialists.
