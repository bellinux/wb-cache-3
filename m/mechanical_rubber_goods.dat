50|$|SP Nano is the {{developer}} of SP1 - a revolutionary nano-reinforcement protein agent that will transform the composite materials and rubber industries by enabling {{the production of}} lighter, stronger and sustainable parts. SP Nano was established in 2007 is commercializing the use of carbon-based nanoparticles in the rapidly growing €140 billion <b>mechanical</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>goods</b> (MRG) and €84 billion composites markets. These markets includes raw materials such as carbon/glass fiber and aramid, and are commonly used in industries such as aerospace, construction, automotive and marine, wind energy and sports equipment. SP Nano’s proprietary SP1 technology can significantly improve the performance properties of composites; enabling cost-effective manufacture of stronger and lighter parts.

50|$|It is {{also used}} as a medium for water {{resistance}} in electrical cable-jointing, roofing membranes (since it does not pollute the run-off rainwater, which is of vital importance for rainwater harvesting), geomembranes, <b>rubber</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>goods,</b> plastic impact modification, thermoplastic, vulcanizates, and many other applications. Colored EPDM granules are mixed with polyurethane binders and troweled or sprayed onto concrete, asphalt, screenings, interlocking brick, wood, etc. to create a non-slip, soft, porous safety surface for wet-deck areas such as pool decks and as safety surfacing under playground play equipment (designed to help lessen fall injury).|$|R
50|$|EPM has a {{large number}} of uses due to the many ways in which the polymer can be designed, for example; it is used in {{automotive}} weather-stripping and seals, self-amalgamating tape, glass run channels, radiators, garden and appliance hoses, tubing, belts, roofing membranes, expansion joints, <b>rubber</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>goods,</b> plastic impact modification, thermoplastic vulcanisates and motor oil additive applications. EPM is even more prevalent as an insulator for high-voltage cables since it has improved insulative characteristics over more traditional cables, such as cross-linked polyethylene, enabling a smaller cross sectional area for the same load carrying capacity. The cable is flexible and suited to applications where regular cable movement is required such as in the mining industry.|$|R
40|$|In {{this works}} {{the effects of}} the {{hardness}} on the stress relaxation behaviour of EPDM rubber at the room temperature were experimentally investigated.

Therefore this rubber as an elastomer is an engineering material that has wide range of applications in industry such as door and window seals radiator garden and heating hoses tubing washers belts electrical insulation roofing membrane and <b>rubber</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>goods.</b> In the study stress relaxation experiments were carried out for different loading programs by using EPDM specimens having different hardnesses. In addition for the loading programs that were implemented it is shown that for the EPDM rubbers tested the stress relaxation curves obtained at different stretch ratios may be represented by a single representative curve for the specimens having the same hardnesses...|$|R

40|$|Polyketone fiber is {{considered}} as a reinforcement of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>goods</b> (MRG) such as tires, automobile hoses, and belts because of its high strength and modulus. In order to apply it to those purposes, the high adhesion of fiber/rubber interface and good sustainability to aging conditions are very important. In this study, polyketone fiber reinforced natural rubber composites were prepared and they were subjected to thermal and humidity aging, to assess the changes of the interfacial adhesion and material properties. Also, the effect of adhesive primer treatment, based on the resorcinol formaldehyde resin and latex (RFL), of polyketone fiber for high interfacial adhesion was evaluated. Morphological and property changes of the rubber composites were analyzed by using various instrumental analyses. As a result, the rubber composite was aged largely by thermal aging at high temperature rather than humidity aging condition. Interfacial adhesion of the polyketone/NR composites was improved by the primer treatment and its effect was maintained in aging conditions...|$|E
