When regulations allowed longer (36 ft) and wider (8 ft [...] in or 2.5 m) vehicles, BCV did not extend this chassis {{and moved to a}} new concept with a rear engine. Despite this, as late as 1962, an option was designed to incorporate major modifications to the chassis to fit air springs instead of the traditional multi-leaf springs. The air sprung version was popular for chassis intended for coach bodywork, just before the 36 ft model for fitment to the RE chassis. Few customers specified air springs for bus versions. Bristol Omnibus Company was the main one and it was on the basis that the better suspension caused less stress and damage to the chassis and bodywork and reduced lifetime costs of operating the vehicles would outweigh higher initial purchase price. Their chief engineer at the time, Mr E Hardy, was sorely displeased when the option was withdrawn for the last year of production.|$|R

40|$|The {{study is}} placed {{within the context}} of local {{building}} regulations in India. Building regulations, for fenestration in general and window openings in particular, are, to a large extent, ambiguous in nature. In the context of India, observations show that the regulations specify window size {{for the sole purpose of}} ventilation whereas windows are major roleplayers in the thermal and daylighting performance of buildings. In this paper, parametric simulation is used to generate data for cooling and lighting loads for typical commercial office spaces in the hot-dry climate of Ahmedabad, India. This data is then analysed using Multiple Regression techniques to express loads as a function of floor area, aspect ratio, window-to-wall ratio and orientation of windows. The equations derived from regression help compare the energy implications <b>of</b> varying window <b>sizes</b> and their orientations. The observations and results stress the need to re-analyse local building regulations as they fail to indicate the <b>maximum</b> allowable <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> window <b>size</b> leading to highly inefficient building design...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the microstructures of the transition-metal oxides (refs 1 - 3), {{including}} the high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) copper oxide superconductors (refs 4 - 7), are complex. This is particularly so when there are oxygen interstitials or vacancies (ref. 8), which influence the bulk properties. For example, the oxygen interstitials in the spacer layers separating the superconducting CuO 2 planes undergo ordering phenomena in Sr(2) O(1 +y) CuO(2) (ref. 9), YBa(2) Cu(3) O(6 +y) (ref. 10) and La(2) CuO(4 +y) (refs 11 - 15) that induce enhancements in the transition temperatures with no changes in hole concentrations. It is also known that complex systems often have a scale-invariant structural organization 16, but hitherto none had been found in high-Tc materials. Here we report that the ordering of oxygen interstitials in the La(2) O(2 +y) spacer layers of La(2) CuO(4 +y) high-Tc superconductors is characterized by a fractal distribution up to a <b>maximum</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> 400 microns. Intriguingly, these fractal distributions of dopants seem to enhance superconductivity at high temperature. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we examine}} the {{evolution}} of irradiated clouds using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) algorithm coupled with a ray-tracing scheme that calculates {{the position of the}} ionisation-front at each timestep. We present results from simulations performed for three choices of IR-flux spanning the range of fluxes emitted by a typical B-type star to a cluster of OB-type stars. The extent of photo-ablation, of course, depends on the strength of the incident flux and a strong flux of IR severely ablates a MC. Consequently, the first star-formation sites appear in the dense shocked layer along the edges of the irradiated cloud. Radiation-induced turbulence readily generates dense filamentary structure within the photo-ablated cloud although several new star-forming sites also appear in some of the densest regions at the junctions of these filaments. Prevalent physical conditions within a MC {{play a crucial role in}} determining the mode, i. e., filamentary as compared to isolated pockets, of star-formation, the timescale on which stars form and the distribution of stellar masses. The probability density functions (PDFs) derived for irradiated clouds in this study are intriguing due to their resemblance with those presented in a recent census of irradiated MCs. Furthermore, irrespective of the nature of turbulence, the protostellar mass-functions(MFs) derived in this study follow a power-law distribution. When turbulence within the cloud is driven by a relatively strong flux of IR such as that emitted by a massive O-type star or a cluster of such stars, the MF approaches the canonical form due to Salpeter, and even turns-over for protostellar masses smaller than ∼ 0. 2 M_.

60|$|The {{numerous}} {{cases of}} sand and volcanic dust being carried enormous distances through the atmosphere sufficiently prove the importance of wind as a carrier of solid matter, but unfortunately the matter collected has not been hitherto examined {{with a view to}} determine the maximum <b>size</b> and weight <b>of</b> the particles. A few facts, however, have been kindly furnished me by Professor Judd, F.R.S. Some dust which fell at Genoa on 15th October 1885, and was believed to have been brought from the African desert, consisted of quartz, hornblende, and other minerals, and contained particles having a diameter of 1/500 inch, each weighing 1/200,000 grain. This dust had probably travelled over 600 miles. In the dust from Krakatoa, which fell at Batavia, about 100 miles distant, during the great eruption, there are many solid particles even larger than those mentioned above. Some of this dust was given me by Professor Judd, and I found in it several ovoid particles of a much larger size, being 1/50 inch long, and 1/70 wide and deep. The dust from the same eruption, which fell on board the ship Arabella, 970 miles from the volcano, also contained solid particles 1/500 inch diameter. Mr. John Murray of the Challenger Expedition writes to me that he finds in the deep sea deposits 500 and even 700 miles west of the coast of Africa, rounded particles of quartz, having a diameter of 1/250 inch, and similar particles are found at equally great distances from the south-west coasts of Australia; and he considers these to be atmospheric dust carried to that distance by the wind. Taking the sp. gr. of quartz at 2.6, these particles would weigh about 1/25,000 grain each. These interesting facts can, however, by no means be taken as indicating the extreme <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> the power of wind in carrying solid particles. During the Krakatoa eruption no gale of special violence occurred, and the region is one of comparative calms. The grains of quartz found by Mr. Murray more nearly indicate the limit, but the very small portions of matter brought up by the dredge, as compared with the enormous areas of sea-bottom, over which the atmospheric dust must have been scattered, render it in the highest degree improbable that the <b>maximum</b> <b>limit</b> either <b>of</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> particles, or of distance from land has been reached.|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{investigation into}} the relationship between physical forcing and sus- pended particles in the shallow shelf region of the Western English Channel has been conducted, in order to evaluate the temporal dynamics of suspended particle populations. Measurements were taken across tidal cycles and seasons at station L 4, part of the Western Channel Observatory (WCO), using {{the combination of a}} free-fall microstructure profiler and holographic imaging. Confirmation that L 4 is weakly stratified is given, and that the formation of the seasonal thermocline is substantially altered by the spring-neap cy- cle. Stratification is variable and prone to periodic and partial erosion from atmospheric forcing during any point in any season. L 4 undergoes moderate turbulent dissipation, principally as a result of tidal forcing. Typically, values of ε do not exceed 10 − 4 W kg− 1. L 4 also exhibits tidal asymmetry, chiefly in response to stratification which, albeit weak, is frequently able to suppress turbulence when generated from the sea bed. The potential energy anomaly is small at L 4, as expected for a weakly-stratified environment. Maxi- mum values in summer were shown to not exceed 50 J m− 3. Values of bed stress, τ 0, are rarely greater than around 0. 18 N m− 2. Nonetheless, the critical erosion threshold falls below this, and is therefore smaller than that observed in similar locations around the UK. Seasonality in the amount of material resuspended from the seabed is important at L 4. The presence of certain biological particles strongly influence particle size and may also determine if a given particle is lifted from the bed. Particles ≥ 200 μm are relatively rare, the site is dominated by particles smaller than this value in line with many other UK sites. Under certain conditions the theoretical <b>maximum</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> particle <b>size,</b> the Kolmogorov length scale, does not hold and many examples of occasions when this threshold is exceeded are shown. This may generate important consequences in subsequent work undertaken at this site and other temperate shelf locations globally, particularly as these results indicate that maximum particle size appears to be governed less by the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the local turbulent eddies and more by the presence of biological particles. This is another key seasonal component to particle dynamics in the Western English Channel. Phytoplankton populations are readily advected {{into and out of the}} L 4 site, calling into question the current sampling strategy of the WCO to rely exclusively upon point measurements. Small increases in atmospheric forcing have the ability to rapidly disperse patches of phytoplankton, possibly to the point of cell mortality. Traditional sampling techniques for assessing zooplankton density have been shown to radically underestimate the number of animals present at L 4, which will increase error estimates on current ecosystem models...|$|R
