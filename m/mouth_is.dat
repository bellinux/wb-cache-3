5|$|Situated on an {{isolated}} patch of grass, the right-hand figure's toothed <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> stretched open as if screaming, although David Sylvester {{has suggested that}} it may be yawning. Its <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> open to a degree impossible for a human skull. The orange background of this panel is brighter than the hues rendered in the other frames, and the figure's neck opens up into a row of teeth, while a protruding ear juts out from behind its lower jaw. This panel closely resembles an earlier painting by Bacon, Untitled, c. 1943, which was thought destroyed until it re-emerged in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Cleveland, {{located at}} the Cuyahoga River's <b>mouth,</b> <b>is</b> a major bulk freight {{terminal}} on Lake Erie, receiving much of the raw materials used by the region's manufacturing industries.|$|E
50|$|On June 25, 1997 at 10:00 A.M., the air {{temperature}} {{in the vicinity of}} Crooked Run 0.81 mi upstream of its <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> 28 C and the water temperature was 15.8 C. One hour and 35 minutes later, the {{air temperature}} near the stream 2.75 mi upstream of its <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> 34 C and the water temperature was 14.3 C. The specific conductivity of the stream's waters 0.81 mi upstream of its mouth and 2.75 mi upstream of its <b>mouth</b> <b>are</b> 32 and 21 umhos, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|The river's <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> once located {{much further}} south. In the early 1800s it entered the ocean at Broadbeach and by 1930 its <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> located where Sea World now is. [...] The main driving force for this {{movement}} is the northward drift of sand along the coast.|$|R

5|$|Although most methamphetamine users {{lived in}} Asia {{in the early}} 2000s, {{the use of the}} drug {{increased}} dramatically {{in other parts of the}} world in that decade. In areas where use of the drug has become common, meth <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> often widespread. The condition is expensive to treat and has strained public health resources, prompting concerns among dental authorities in several countries about the burden of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Among vertebrates, the Australian {{frilled lizard}} (Chlamydosaurus kingii) has a startling display in which wide semicircular frills {{on either side}} of the head are fanned out; the <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> opened wide exposing the gape; the tail is waved over the body, and the body is raised, so that the animal appears as large and {{threatening}} as possible.|$|E
5|$|At the {{southern}} edge of Leidy Township, Kettle Creek makes several meanders, crossing the border between Leidy Township and Noyes Township three times. The creek then meanders several miles through Noyes Township, passing strip mines and another gauging station. The creek's <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> at the community of Westport, near Pennsylvania Route 120.|$|E

60|$|Gudrun's <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> still closed, sullen and ugly. She {{opened it}} at length.|$|R
5|$|Crocodilian teeth {{vary from}} blunt and dull to sharp and needle-like. Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform. The teeth of {{crocodiles}} and gharials {{tend to be}} more visible than those of alligators and caimans when the jaws are closed. The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. The teeth on the lower jaw of an alligator fit into sockets in the upper jaw, so only the upper teeth are visible when the <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> closed. The teeth on the lower jaw of a crocodile fit into grooves {{on the outside of the}} top jaw making both the upper and lower teeth visible when the <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> closed.|$|E
5|$|Hydrochloric acid {{is used in}} methamphetamine's {{manufacturing}} process, but academic reviews {{have not}} supported {{the idea that the}} acid contributes to dental decay. Speculation that oral consumption of the drug causes tooth decay by raising the acidity of users' mouths is also unsupported. Meth <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> generally most severe in users who inject the drug, rather than those who smoke, ingest or inhale it.|$|E
5|$|In {{the scene}} where Tracy is on his bacon run, every mention of January 17th is either shot so the actor's <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> hidden or dubbed over. This can be seen most clearly when Cerie says January 17th. It seems the {{original}} was February 17th but later changed to match the release date of the episode. Closed captioning still shows February 17th.|$|E
50|$|In {{comparison}} with other Notropis, the common shiner's head, eyes, and <b>mouth</b> <b>are</b> large.|$|R
60|$|He smiled faintly. Those subtle lines {{about his}} <b>mouth</b> <b>were</b> not there in vain.|$|R

5|$|Reaching {{a length}} of at least , the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} has a trowel-shaped pectoral fin disc with a short, blunt snout and concave leading margins. The medium-sized eyes are followed by smaller, nearly circular spiracles with smooth rims. A pair of large electric organs are located {{on either side of}} the head. There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils with a three-lobed posterior margin. The narrow, highly protrusible <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> encircled by a deep groove. The teeth are small and diamond-shaped with pointed tips; they are arranged with a quincunx pattern into bands, which remain exposed when the <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> closed. There are five pairs of gill slits beneath the disc.|$|E
5|$|Rolling {{a person}} with an active tonic-clonic seizure onto their side and into the {{recovery}} position helps prevent fluids from getting into the lungs. Putting fingers, a bite block or tongue depressor in the <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> not recommended as it might make the person vomit or result in the rescuer being bitten. Efforts {{should be taken to}} prevent further self-injury. Spinal precautions are generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|The Australian swellshark has a stocky, rounded {{body that}} tapers {{significantly}} to the short caudal peduncle. The head comprises {{no more than a}} fifth of the total length and is broad and moderately flattened, with a very short, thick, blunt snout. The nostrils are divided into small incurrent and excurrent openings by short, triangular flaps of skin that do not reach the mouth. The <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> extremely large, without furrows at the corners. The teeth are numerous and small with multiple cusps; the upper teeth are exposed when the <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> closed. The large, oval eyes are placed somewhat on the upper surface of the head, and have rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids) and ridges underneath.|$|E
50|$|Because the river's <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> mapped incorrectly, later explorers {{believed}} the Roncière did not exist.|$|R
50|$|Hainley's 2006 book of poetry, Foul <b>Mouth,</b> <b>was</b> {{a finalist}} in the National Poetry Series.|$|R
60|$|Selingman nodded ponderously. His <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> very full, {{but he did}} not delay his speech.|$|R
5|$|The central figure's <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> {{positioned}} {{directly on}} its neck, {{rather than on}} a distinct face. It bares its teeth {{as if in a}} snarl, and is blindfolded by a drooping cloth bandage—a device likely drawn from Matthias Grünewald's Mocking of Christ. This creature faces the viewer directly and is centralised by a series of converging lines radiating {{from the base of the}} pedestal.|$|E
5|$|The eggs hatch within between 23 and 32 {{hours of}} each other and can be preceded by the chick in the egg calling for up to 45 hours before {{hatching}}. One hatching was recorded as taking 15 hours to complete. Newly hatched chicks are covered by downy black plumage, the legs, feet and bill are black, and the <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> silvery.|$|E
5|$|The extant Alligatoridae are {{two species}} in the genus Alligator, and six species of caimans grouped into three genera. They can be {{recognised}} by the broad snout, in which the fourth tooth of the lower jaw cannot be seen when the <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> closed.|$|E
50|$|The river's <b>mouth,</b> which <b>is</b> located {{east of the}} Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway, was {{actually}} reclaimed from the sea. The original <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> situated under a bridge linking Bridge Street (now Jalan C.Y. Choy) and Jelutong Road.|$|R
25|$|The {{channels}} {{above the}} <b>mouth</b> <b>are</b> said to change {{frequently in the}} spring and early summer.|$|R
60|$|His <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> red {{under his}} ragged, sandy moustache. His teeth were white as he laughed.|$|R
5|$|The extant Crocodylidae are twelve {{species in}} the genus Crocodylus, and two species in other genera. They {{have a variety of}} snout shapes, but can be {{recognised}} because the fourth tooth of the lower jaw is visible when the <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> closed.|$|E
5|$|The fold {{that connects}} {{the back of the}} sublingua and tongue to the rear floor of the <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> called the plica sublingualis. In lemurs, this is an {{underdeveloped}} structure consisting of only a tiny outgrowth {{on the floor of the}} mouth. The point where the plica sublingualis attaches to the rear floor of the mouth marks the location of the submandibular salivary glands.|$|E
5|$|The leopard {{catshark}} is {{the smaller}} and slimmer {{of the two}} Poroderma species. The head and snout are short and slightly flattened, with a somewhat pointed snout tip. Each nostril is split into tiny incurrent and excurrent openings by a three-lobed flap of skin in front, of which the central lobe forms a slender barbel that reaches past the mouth. The horizontally oval eyes are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids) and placed rather high on the head, with a thick ridge running under each. The <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> wide and arched, with short furrows at the corners extending onto both jaws; the upper teeth are exposed when the <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> closed. There are 1830 and 1326 tooth rows {{on either side of}} the upper and lower jaws respectively. The teeth have a narrow central cusp with a pair of small lateral cusplets; those of adult males are slightly more curved than those of females.|$|E
