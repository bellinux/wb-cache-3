We {{have investigated the}} current reduction issue for CRAM cell theoretically and experimentally.

30|$|The LSTM uses {{gates to}} control {{information}} flow and effectively creates shortcut paths across multiple temporal steps. The key ideas behind the LSTM unit are {{the addition of}} a <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> block to maintain temporal information and the use of non-linear activation gates to control both the information flow into the <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> and the output of the unit. Each LSTM unit consists of one cell unit and four control gates. These gates control the input and output as well as the temporal extent of the <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> through a forget gate. The <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> itself can also directly control the gates. The LSTM units implement this by peephole connections from the <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> to the gates to learn precise timing information.|$|R

25|$|Flash memory stores {{information}} in {{an array of}} <b>memory</b> <b>cells</b> made from floating-gate transistors. In single-level cell (SLC) devices, each cell stores only one bit of information. Multi-level cell (MLC) devices, including triple-level cell (TLC) devices, can store more than one bit per cell.|$|E

The second generation NRAM technology is based on a two-terminal <b>memory</b> <b>cell.</b> The two-terminal cell has advantages such as a smaller cell size, better scalability to sub-20 nm nodes (see semiconductor device fabrication), and the ability to passivate the <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> during fabrication.|$|R
50|$|The <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> is the {{fundamental}} building block of computer <b>memory.</b> The <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> is an electronic circuit that stores one bit of binary information {{and it must be}} set to store a logic 1 (high voltage level) and reset to store a logic 0 (low voltage level).

25|$|Deletion or anergy of {{activated}} T-cells follows infection. This {{results from}} production of IL-4 and IL-10 from prolonged {{exposure to the}} toxin. The IL-4 and IL-10 downregulate production of IFN-gamma, MHC Class II, and costimulatory molecules {{on the surface of}} APCs. These effects produce <b>memory</b> <b>cells</b> that are unresponsive to antigen stimulation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Memory</b> <b>cells</b> in {{different}} vertical layers do {{not interfere with}} each other, as the charges cannot move vertically through the silicon nitride storage medium, and the electric fields associated with the gates are closely confined within each layer. The vertical collection is electrically identical to the serial-linked groups in which conventional NANDflash memory is configured.|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} Metal-Ferroelectric-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MFSFET) in a resistive-load SRAM <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> {{has been}} {{investigated}} A typical two-transistor resistive-load SRAM <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> architecture is modified by replacing one of the NMOS transistors with an n-channel MFSFET. The gate of the MFSFET is connected to a polling voltage pulse instead of the other NMOS transistor drain. The polling voltage pulses are of sufficient magnitude to saturate the ferroelectric gate material and force the MFSFET into a particular logic state. The <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> circuit is further modified {{by the addition of}} a PMOS transistor and a load resistor in order to improve the retention characteristics of the <b>memory</b> <b>cell.</b> The retention characteristics of both the " 1 " and " 0 " logic states are simulated.

40|$|The program {{consistency}} of high density gate-oxide anti-fuse PROM (programmable read only <b>memory)</b> <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> is considered in this paper. To solve this problem, we do {{research on the}} mechanism and models of gate-oxide break down. A test chip based on 2 T <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> is also designed for the experiment. During the test, {{we have found that}} the program {{consistency of}} 2 T cell is really pessimistic. What’s more, the program voltage has effect on the consistency. Through research and test, we have got the optimal program voltage- 6. 5 V for 2 T <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> in 180 nm technology. To further improve the consistency, we modify the 2 T <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> and propose a 3 T <b>memory</b> <b>cell.</b> It consumes 18 % more area, but the standard deviation of equivalent resistance decreases 15. 3 % in the worst situation. The deviation can decrease 80. 3 % at most. The program consistency is greatly improved...|$|R
3000|$|Each NAND flash <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> is a {{floating}} gate transistor whose threshold voltage can be programmed by injecting certain amount of charges into the floating gate. Before a flash <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> can be programmed, it must be erased (i.e., remove all the charges from the floating gate, which sets its threshold voltage to the lowest voltage window).

Finally, the hole is filled with conducting (doped) polysilicon.|$|E
25|$|The Th2 {{response}} {{is characterized by}} the release of Interleukin 5, which induces eosinophils in the clearance of parasites. Th2 also produce Interleukin 4, which facilitates B cell isotype switching. In general, Th2 responses are more effective against extracellular bacteria, parasites including helminths and toxins. Like cytotoxic T cells, most of the CD4+ helper cells die on resolution of infection, with a few remaining as CD4+ <b>memory</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|E
25|$|T cells (thymus cells) and B cells (bone marrow- or bursa-derived cells) are {{the major}} {{cellular}} components of the adaptive immune response. T cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity, whereas B cells are primarily responsible for humoral immunity (relating to antibodies). The function of T cells and B cells is to recognize specific “non-self” antigens, during {{a process known as}} antigen presentation. Once they have identified an invader, the cells generate specific responses that are tailored to maximally eliminate specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells. B cells respond to pathogens by producing large quantities of antibodies which then neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses. In response to pathogens some T cells, called T helper cells, produce cytokines that direct the immune response, while other T cells, called cytotoxic T cells, produce toxic granules that contain powerful enzymes which induce the death of pathogen-infected cells. Following activation, B cells and T cells leave a lasting legacy of the antigens they have encountered, in the form of <b>memory</b> <b>cells.</b> Throughout the lifetime of an animal, these <b>memory</b> <b>cells</b> will remember each specific pathogen encountered, and are able to mount a strong and rapid response if the same pathogen is detected again; this is known as acquired immunity.|$|E

They were employed to design a general (hybrid) quantum <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> model that can store both quantum and classical information. In this Letter, we find an interesting new phenomenon that the purely classical <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> can be super-activated to preserve quantum states, whereas the null <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> can only be super-activated to encode classical information. Furthermore, necessary and sufficient conditions for this phenomenon are discovered so that the super-activation can be easily checked by examining certain eigenvalues of the quantum <b>memory</b> <b>cell</b> without computing the noiseless subsystems explicitly.

25|$|NOR and NAND flash {{get their}} names from the {{structure}} of the interconnections between <b>memory</b> <b>cells.</b> In NORflash, cells are connected in parallel to the bit lines, allowing cells to be read and programmed individually. The parallel connection of cells resembles the parallel connection of transistors in a CMOS NOR gate. In NANDflash, cells are connected in series, resembling a NAND gate. The series connections consume less space than parallel ones, reducing the cost of NANDflash. It does not, by itself, prevent NAND cells from being read and programmed individually.|$|E
25|$|Several {{algorithms}} {{for finding}} cycles quickly and with little memory are known. Floyd's tortoise and the hare algorithm moves two pointers at different speeds through {{the sequence of}} values until they both point to equal values. Alternatively, Brent's algorithm {{is based on the}} idea of exponential search. Both Floyd's and Brent's algorithms use only a constant number of <b>memory</b> <b>cells,</b> and take a number of function evaluations that is proportional to the distance {{from the start of the}} sequence to the first repetition. Several other algorithms trade off larger amounts of memory for fewer function evaluations.|$|E
25|$|As {{the feature}} size of flash <b>memory</b> <b>cells</b> reaches the 15-16 nm minimum limit, further flash density {{increases}} will {{be driven by}} TLC (3bits/cell) combined with vertical stacking of NAND memory planes. The decrease in endurance and increase in uncorrectable bit error rates that accompany feature size shrinking can be compensated by improved error correction mechanisms. Even with these advances, it may be impossible to economically scale flash to smaller and smaller dimensions {{as the number of}} electron holding capacity reduces. Many promising new technologies (such as FeRAM, MRAM, PMC, PCM, ReRAM, and others) are under investigation and development as possible more scalable replacements for flash.|$|E

25|$|Autoreactive B {{cells can}} accidentally emerge during somatic {{hypermutation}} and migrate into the germinal center light zone. Autoreactive B cells, maturated coincidentally, normally {{do not receive}} survival signals by antigen planted on follicular dendritic cells and perish by apoptosis. In the case of clearance deficiency, apoptotic nuclear debris accumulates in the light zone of GC and gets attached to FDC. This serves as a germinal centre survival signal for autoreactive B-cells. After migration into the mantle zone, autoreactive B cells require further survival signals from autoreactive helper T cells, which promote the maturation of autoantibody-producing plasma cells and B <b>memory</b> <b>cells.</b> In the presence of autoreactive T cells, a chronic autoimmune disease may be the consequence.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the series}} {{connection}} and removal of wordline contacts, a large grid of NANDflash <b>memory</b> <b>cells</b> will occupy perhaps only 60% of the area of equivalent NOR cells (assuming the same CMOS process resolution, for example, 130nm, 90nm, or 65nm). NANDflash's designers realized that the area of a NAND chip, and thus the cost, could be further reduced by removing the external address and data bus circuitry. Instead, external devices could communicate with NANDflash via sequential-accessed command and data registers, which would internally retrieve and output the necessary data. This design choice made random-access of NANDflash memory impossible, but the goal of NANDflash was to replace mechanical hard disks, not to replace ROMs.|$|E
25|$|Deep neural {{networks}} can be potentially improved by deepening and parameter reduction, while maintaining trainability. While training extremely deep (e.g., 1 million layers) {{neural networks}} {{might not be}} practical, CPU-like architectures such as pointer networks and neural random-access machines overcome this limitation by using external random-access memory and other components that typically belong to a computer architecture such as registers, ALU and pointers. Such systems operate on probability distribution vectors stored in <b>memory</b> <b>cells</b> and registers. Thus, the model is fully differentiable and trains end-to-end. The key characteristic of these models is that their depth, {{the size of their}} short-term memory, and the number of parameters can be altered independently — unlike models like LSTM, whose number of parameters grows quadratically with memory size.|$|E
