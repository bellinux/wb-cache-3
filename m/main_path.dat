The <b>main</b> <b>path</b> resonates at around 30Hz, but the complicated sinus anatomy causes peaks and valleys in the sound.|$|E
5|$|Swirral Edge {{offers a}} shorter but equally {{exciting}} scramble along a similar sharp arête. The <b>main</b> <b>path</b> to {{it comes up}} from Red Tarn, which is linked by a surprisingly level path to Hole-in-the-Wall, making this ridge equally accessible from Patterdale as from Glenridding. The ridge walk can be extended to include the summit of Catstye Cam.|$|E
5|$|Ben Nevis's popularity, {{climate and}} complex {{topography}} {{contribute to a}} high number of mountain rescue incidents. In 1999, for example, there were 41 rescues and four fatalities on the mountain. Some accidents arise over difficulties in navigating to or from the summit, especially in poor visibility. The problem {{stems from the fact that}} the summit plateau is roughly kidney-shaped and surrounded by cliffs on three sides; the danger is particularly accentuated when the <b>main</b> <b>path</b> is obscured by snow. Two precise compass bearings taken in succession are necessary to navigate from the summit cairn to the west flank, from where a descent can be made on the Pony Track in relative safety.|$|E

5|$|The orchard {{contains}} {{fruit trees}} such as quinces, medlars, crab {{apples and pears}} are underplanted with spring-flowering meadow plants such as snakeshead fritillaries, camassias, narcissus, cowslips and lady's smock. The orchard is crossed by wide mown paths meeting at a central sundial. Originally four weeping elms were situated at {{the four corners of}} the garden, but they succumbed to Dutch elm disease in the early seventies and were replaced in 1973 by four weeping ash trees which make inviting 'houses'. The orchard can be viewed from the raised walk on its east side, another idea copied from Avebury Manor. A <b>main</b> <b>path</b> known as the Long walk is based on the Long Walk at Hidcote Manor Garden in Gloucestershire, although it is on a smaller scale. It is a plain grassed walkway connecting the Raised Walk with the Pond Garden.|$|E

25|$|Bloodbornes {{world of}} Yharnam {{is a large}} map full of areas that are {{connected}}. Some areas of Yharnam are not connected to the main locations and require the player to teleport there via the gravestones in the Hunter's Dream. Players are usually presented with multiple options when progressing through locations; usually there is a <b>main</b> <b>path</b> that the player uses to progress through the story. When traversing the <b>main</b> <b>path,</b> the player will encounter paths that lead to completely different locations that are optional. Each path also eventually leads back to the central area the player started in. This provides players with shortcuts, useful for when they die or need to backtrack.|$|E
50|$|Jnana yoga (Yoga of Knowledge) {{is one of}} {{the three}} <b>main</b> <b>paths</b> (margas), which are {{supposed}} to lead towards moksha (liberation) from material miseries. The other two <b>main</b> <b>paths</b> are Karma yoga and Bhakti Yoga. Rāja yoga (classical yoga) which includes several yogas, is also said to lead to moksha. It is said that each path is meant for a different temperament of personality.|$|R

A Ngang morning chanting ceremony accompanied by sacred musical instruments is usually led by the few remaining monks of the temple. Pilgrims may circumambulate the hall but tourists, particularly photographers, are asked to be extremely sensitive to the sacred atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|The broad, grassy {{trackway}} {{found by}} the Romans had already {{been used by the}} Britons for centuries. The <b>main</b> <b>path</b> led from Richborough on the English Channel to a natural ford in the Thames at Thorney Island near Westminster to a site near Wroxeter, where it split. The western continuation went on to Holyhead while the northern ran to Chester and on to the Picts in Scotland.|$|E
25|$|Great End may be ascended from Sty Head Tarn via The Band (not to be {{confused}} with the more famous Band on Bowfell), from Wasdale Head along Lingmell Gill and Spouthead Gill, from Borrowdale via Grains Gill, from Great Langdale via Rossett Gill and Esk Hause, or from Eskdale. As an intermediate objective Great End may easily be climbed from the <b>main</b> <b>path</b> between Esk Hause and Scafell Pike, requiring only a detour of some 400m.|$|E

25|$|The top of Sail is a heathery dome {{bearing a}} small cairn. The <b>main</b> <b>path</b> {{along the ridge}} passes by to the south to take its heavily eroded course up Crag Hill. The view, other than where blocked by this lower neighbour, is excellent. The head of Coledale is laid out to the north while eastward is the full sweep of the Helvellyn range above Catbells. The High fells around Ennerdale, Wasdale {{and the head of}} Eskdale {{complete}} the panorama southward. Bassenthwaite Lake {{can be seen from the}} summit and a few steps will bring Buttermere and Derwentwater into view.|$|E
25|$|The Herbaceous Grounds (Order Beds) were devised in {{the late}} 1860s by Sir Joseph Hooker, then {{director}} of the Royal Botanic Gardens, so that botany students could learn to recognise plants and experience at first hand {{the diversity of the}} plant kingdom. The collection is organised into family groups. Its name arose because plant families were known as natural orders in the 19th century. Over the <b>main</b> <b>path</b> is a rose pergola built in 1959 to mark the bicentennial of the Gardens. It supports climber and rambling roses selected for the length and profusion of flowering.|$|E
25|$|The track {{climbs up}} through the forest. On the {{northern}} {{side of the mountain}} there is no bamboo zone, so the forest gradually turns into moorland covered with giant heather. The track ends at Old Moses Camp and becomes a path. This continues up the hill before splitting into two routes. To the left, the least used path goes {{around the side of the}} Barrow, to Likii North Hut. The vegetation becomes more sparse, with giant lobelia and groundsels dotted around. The path climbs over a ridge, before rejoining the <b>main</b> <b>path</b> ascending the Mackinder Valley. Shipton's Cave can be found in the rock wall to the left of the steep path just before reaching Shipton's Camp.|$|E

25|$|The player {{follows the}} war effort through all four countries, with its own COs, {{over the course of}} the game. Starting with having only one choice of a CO to advise, Andy, the player will have a choice of two more Orange Star COs, Max and Sami, to advise as the story progresses, each with their own {{advantages}} and disadvantages. Depending on which CO is chosen by the player to advise, there are times when a mission is split into a choice of two or three, where the maps and dialog could be different. After completing that mission, the story paths could split up, depending on which CO was chosen in that previous mission, with the story differing from the other path, eventually leading back to the <b>main</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following {{the fall}} of Roman/Christian Anatolia to the Muslim Turks, the Romans put out {{a call to the}} Pope in Rome for {{assistance}} in the 11th century. The result was a series of wars known as the Crusades launched by Latin Christians (of mainly French origin) in Western Europe to reclaim the former Roman territories in the Eastern Mediterranean, especially Syria and Palestine (the Levant). Lebanon was in the <b>main</b> <b>path</b> of the First Crusade's advance on Jerusalem. Frankish nobles occupied areas within present-day Lebanon as part of the southeastern Crusader States. The southern half of present-day Lebanon formed the northern march of the Kingdom of Jerusalem; the northern half was the heartland of the County of Tripoli. Although Saladin eliminated Christian control of the Holy Land around 1190, the Crusader states in Lebanon and Syria were better defended.|$|E
25|$|The Port of Ios is at {{the head}} of the Ormos harbor in the northwest. From there the bus or a 15-minute walk up the steep donkey path takes you to the village, known as Chora. Chora is a white and very picturesque cycladic village, full of stairs and narrow paths that make it {{inaccessible}} for cars of any kind. Today, the <b>main</b> <b>path</b> through this village is completely taken over by tourism in terms of restaurants, boutiques, bars and discothèques. Apart from the port and the village of Chora, Ios has only a few small settlements, just a group of spread out houses in the background of major beaches (Theodoti, Kalamos, Manganari). Since the 1990s, the island mayor Pousseos has worked on Ios' development towards attracting different types of tourists. With the help of European Community funds some roads have been built, all of them paved, and a scenic amphitheater has been created by the German architect Peter Haupt (who died in 2003) at the top of the village hill. Unfortunately, cultural events rarely take place up there.|$|E

500|$|In 2014 Poet's Corner was re-sited to {{the other}} side of the <b>main</b> <b>path</b> and the ode, on a re-gilded board, was {{installed}} in a completely new oak frame. The new Poet's Corner, funded by the Friends of Richmond Park and the Visitor Centre at Pembroke Lodge, and by a donation in memory of Wendy Vachell, also includes three curved benches made from reclaimed teak. The benches are inscribed with a couplet by the Welsh poet W. H. Davies, [...] "A poor life this, if, full of care, we have no time to stand and stare".|$|E

500|$|Immediately upon {{entry into}} the {{national}} park, {{a fork in the}} <b>main</b> <b>path</b> begins a trail running through the inner peninsula leading to a local cavern known as the Cave of Zeus (...) [...] The entrance is dense in vegetation, covering parts of it. There is also a wishing tree to which people usually tie objects and belongings, hoping for their wishes to be granted. The Cave of Zeus is filled with clear subterranean spring water, making it another common tourist attraction near the national park. Visits to the cave typically increase as the waters of the nearby beaches become rougher, thereby making them less inviting. The cave's name invokes the many legends that concern the cave and its origins, including one holding that Zeus bathed in the cave.|$|E
