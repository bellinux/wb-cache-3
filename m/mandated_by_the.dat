5|$|Local Conservative Associations {{began to}} educate {{citizens}} about the Party's platform and {{encouraged them to}} register to vote annually, as <b>mandated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Act. Press coverage of national politics in the local press was joined by in-depth reports on provincial politics in the national press.

Before the shutdown, a list of priority services was compiled and prepared by Minnesota Management and Budget, based on recommendations from state agencies.|$|E
5|$|The Moat Studios in London {{recorded}} Nebulous in stereo, {{with each}} half-hour episode typically taking {{one day to}} record, including read-through and rehearsal.

5|$|The {{courts have}} rarely treated {{content-based}} regulation of journalism with any sympathy. In Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo (1974), the Court unanimously {{struck down a}} state law requiring newspapers criticizing political candidates to publish their responses. The state claimed that the law had been passed to ensure journalistic responsibility. The Supreme Court found that freedom, but not responsibility, is <b>mandated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> First Amendment and so it ruled that the government may not force newspapers to publish that which they do not desire to publish.|$|E
5|$|The first CGPM (1889) {{formally}} {{approved the}} use of 40 prototype metres and 40 prototype kilograms from the British firm Johnson Matthey as the standards <b>mandated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Convention of the Metre.

At regular intervals the national prototypes were compared with and recalibrated against the international prototype.|$|E
5|$|As <b>mandated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Olympic Charter, various {{elements}} frame {{the opening ceremony}} of the Olympic Games. This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred. Most of these rituals were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem. The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theatre representative of its culture. The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor's in terms of memorability. The opening ceremony of the Beijing Games reportedly cost $100million, {{with much of the}} cost incurred in the artistic segment.|$|E

5|$|Blérancourt's {{traditional}} {{power structure}} was reshaped {{by the events}} of 1789. The notary Gellé, previously an undisputed town leader, was challenged by a group of reformists who were led by several of Saint-Just's friends, including the husband of his sister Louise. Their attempts were not successful until 1790 when Blérancourt held its first open municipal elections. <b>Mandated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> National Constituent Assembly, the new electoral structure allowed Saint-Just's friends to assume authority in the village as mayor, secretary, and, in the case of his brother-in-law, head of the local National Guard. The jobless Saint-Just, despite not meeting the legal age and tax qualifications, was allowed to join the Guard.|$|E
5|$|Congress created {{executive}} departments during Washington's {{first months}} in office in 1789, including the State Department on July 27, the Department of War in early August, and the Treasury Department on September 2. The President also received two additional officers without departments: the Attorney General and Postmaster General. Washington appointed Richmond lawyer Edmund Randolph as Attorney General and Samuel Osgood as Postmaster General. He also appointed fellow Virginian Thomas Jefferson to be Secretary of State and Henry Knox as Secretary of War. Finally, he appointed Alexander Hamilton to head the Treasury Department. Washington's cabinet eventually developed into a consultation and advisory body, although this was not <b>mandated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Constitution.|$|E
5|$|In a 2007 report, ConnDOT {{outlined}} {{plans to}} turn SLE into a full-service bidirectional regional rail line, with full-day service and all trains extended to New London. This involves incremental improvements, {{similar to those}} that have already been put into place. One of the first priorities is to add a second platform at all stations, which is <b>mandated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 2003 agreement with Amtrak. New London, Old Saybrook, Guilford, Westbrook, Branford, and stops from New Haven Union Station west all have multiple platforms, while State Street has an island platform serving two tracks with plans for a second platform.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment, the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, Republicans grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be now counted rather than the three-fifths <b>mandated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> previous Three-Fifths Compromise, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E
5|$|Many {{rules and}} {{procedures}} in the Maryland Senate are set by the state constitution. Beyond the constitutional mandates, rules in the Senate are developed by the Rules Committee. The Senate and House of Delegates both meet for ninety days following the second Wednesday in January, although these sessions may be extended for up to thirty days by majority votes in both houses, and special sessions may be called by the Governor. The Senate meets in the Senate Chamber of the Maryland State House, which has both gallery seating and a door open to the State House lobby, the latter being <b>mandated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> state constitution. Seating in the Senate is by party, {{with the leaders of}} each party choosing the exact seating assignments. Each Senator has offices in Annapolis, in the Miller Senate Office Building.|$|E
5|$|Nri {{maintained}} its vast authority {{well into the}} 16th century. The peace <b>mandated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Nri religion and enforced {{by the presence of}} the mbùríchi allowed trade to flourish. Items such as horses, which did not survive in tsetse fly-infested Nri, and seashells, which would have to be transported a long ways due to Nri's distance from the coast, have been found depicted in Nri's bronze. A Nri dignitary was unearthed with ivory, also indicating a wealth in trade existed among the Nri. Another source of income would have been the income brought back by traveling mbùríchi.|$|E

50|$|Being {{related to}} the {{personality}} of the parties, the mandate is terminated with the decease or the legal incapacity of one of the parties or with the dissolution of the legal person of the client or commissioner.

5|$|Recognising their {{financial}} predicament, the LNC lobbied Parliament {{for a new}} Act of Parliament to allow the venture to survive. On 23 July 1855 the London Necropolis & National Mausoleum Amendment Act 1855 received Royal Assent. This Act released the LNC from those compulsory purchases of land which had been <b>mandated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 1852 Act but {{had not yet been}} completed, easing the immediate financial burden. It also allowed a ten-year window for the LNC to sell certain parts of the land bought from Lord Onslow which were not required for the cemetery, to provide a source of income.|$|E
5|$|Sense8 was edited in the Wachowskis' {{headquarters}} in Chicago, Kinowerks, by Joe Hobeck and Joseph Jett Sally {{in the first}} season and by Sally and Fiona Colbeck in the second. Sally previously worked with the Wachowskis as first assistant editor on Speed Racer and editor on Ninja Assassin. The Wachowskis found editing a TV show to be a challenging process because of the required fast turnaround times. Lilly commented that for a feature film they get a minimum of ten weeks for editing as <b>mandated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Directors Guild of America, while for the first season of Sense8 {{they had to be}} moving at a pace of completing two 1-hour episodes (roughly the equivalent of a feature film) every two weeks.|$|E

The scissor doors were dropped for the production model, and significant redesign work was carried out on the design when the wheelbase and overall length of the car was altered. Geoff Lawson, Design Director at Jaguar took a greater interest {{in the car and}} insisted the design had to be seen to be a Jaguar if it was to be successful in promoting the company.
