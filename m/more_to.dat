50|$|The mass {{of a long}} gun {{is usually}} {{greater than that of}} a short gun, making the long gun <b>more</b> {{expensive}} <b>to</b> transport, and <b>more</b> difficult and tiring to carry. The increased moment of inertia makes the long gun slower and <b>more</b> difficult <b>to</b> traverse and elevate, and it is thus slower and <b>more</b> difficult <b>to</b> adjust the aim. However, this also results in greater stability in aiming. The greater amount of material in a long gun tends <b>to</b> make it <b>more</b> expensive <b>to</b> manufacture, other factors being equal. The greater size makes it <b>more</b> difficult <b>to</b> conceal, and <b>more</b> inconvenient <b>to</b> use in confined quarters, as well as requiring a larger storage space.|$|R
