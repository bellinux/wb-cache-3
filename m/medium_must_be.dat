25|$|Because {{at least}} half the {{population}} of atoms must be excited from the ground state to obtain a population inversion, the laser <b>medium</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> very strongly pumped. This makes three-level lasers rather inefficient, despite being the first type of laser to be discovered (based on a ruby laser medium, by Theodore Maiman in 1960). A three-level system could also have a radiative transition between level 3 and 2, and a non-radiative transition between 2 and 1. In this case, the pumping requirements are weaker. In practice, most lasers are four-level lasers, described below.|$|E

25|$|The second law of {{thermodynamics}} {{states that}} any closed-loop cycle can only convert {{a fraction of}} the heat produced during combustion into mechanical work. The rest of the heat, called waste heat, must be released into a cooler environment during the return portion of the cycle. The fraction of heat released into a cooler <b>medium</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> equal or larger than the ratio of absolute temperatures of the cooling system (environment) and the heat source (combustion furnace). Raising the furnace temperature improves the efficiency but complicates the design, primarily by the selection of alloys used for construction, making the furnace more expensive. The waste heat cannot be converted into mechanical energy without an even cooler cooling system. However, it may be used in cogeneration plants to heat buildings, produce hot water, or to heat materials on an industrial scale, such as in some oil refineries, plants, and chemical synthesis plants.|$|E

For an inhomogeneous <b>medium,</b> boundaries <b>must</b> <b>be</b> considered. In addition for a semi-infinite medium (in which photons are considered lost if they exit the top boundary), special consideration <b>must</b> <b>be</b> taken. For more information, please visit the links {{at the bottom of the}} page. We will solve the problem using an infinitely small point source (represented analytically as a Dirac delta function in space and time). Responses to arbitrary source geometries can be constructed using the method of Green's functions (or convolution, if enough spatial symmetry exists). The required parameters are the absorption coefficient, the scattering coefficient, and the scattering phase function. (If boundaries are considered the index of refraction for each <b>medium</b> <b>must</b> also <b>be</b> provided.) Time-resolved responses are found by keeping track of the total elapsed time of the photon's flight using the optical path length. Responses to sources with arbitrary time profiles can then be modeled through convolution in time.|$|R

We had always heard it said that the love of money was the root of all evil, but we had taken this for a saying, merely; now we realized it as an active, vital truth. As soon as money was abolished the power to purchase was gone, and even if there had been any means of buying beyond the daily needs, with overwork, the community had no power to sell to the individual.

60|$|To {{explain the}} unusual Refraction of Island Crystal by Pression or Motion propagated, has not {{hitherto}} been attempted (to my knowledge) except by Huygens, who for that end supposed two several vibrating Mediums within that Crystal. But {{when he tried}} the Refractions in two successive pieces of that Crystal, and found them such as is mention'd above; he confessed himself {{at a loss for}} explaining them. For Pressions or Motions, propagated from a shining Body through an uniform <b>Medium,</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> on all sides alike; whereas by those Experiments it appears, that the Rays of Light have different Properties in their different Sides. He suspected that the Pulses of Æther in passing through the first Crystal might receive certain new Modifications, which might determine them to be propagated in this or that Medium within the second Crystal, according to the Position of that Crystal. But what Modifications those might be he could not say, nor think of any thing satisfactory in that Point. And if he had known that the unusual Refraction depends not on new Modifications, but on the original and unchangeable Dispositions of the Rays, he would have found it as difficult to explain how those Dispositions which he supposed to be impress'd on the Rays by the first Crystal, could be in them before their Incidence on that Crystal, and in general, how all Rays emitted by shining Bodies, can have those Dispositions in them from the beginning. To me, at least, this seems inexplicable, if Light be nothing else than Pression or Motion propagated through Æther.|$|E
