40|$|The {{effect of}} {{seasonal}} cattle grazing on a newly reintroduced population of California <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> (Ovis canadensis californiana) in Big Cottonwood Canyon, Idaho, was studied. The hypothesis that <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> avoid cattle was tested. The issue of avoidance between <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> and livestock is arguable. Some {{studies have found}} that <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> avoid cattle while others have found no response of <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> to cattle. Evidence was found to document the avoidance of cattle by <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep.</b> The size of the bighorn 2 Ì† 7 s home range and core area decreased with the movement of cattle into areas of high bighorn use. As cattle were moved into <b>bighorn</b> core areas, <b>sheep</b> responded by relocating. <b>Bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> decreased their distance to escape terrain as cattle moved closer. The level and location of human disturbance on the study area did not have any effect on <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> movements or how sheep used the habitat. The severity of response observed is in marked contrast with the response of established bighorn populations to cattle. I suggest that newly reintroduced <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> are extremely sensitive to disturbance as a result of relocation trauma. Sensitivity may diminish over time...|$|R

Present-dayrecovery of <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> populations is {{in large part}} limited by periodic outbreaks of respi-ratory disease, which can be transmitted to <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> via contact with domestic sheepgrazing in their vicinity. In order to assess the viability of <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> populations onthe Payette National Forest (PNF) under several alternative proposals for domestic sheepgrazing, we developed a series of interlinked models. Using telemetry and habitat data,we characterized herd home ranges and foray movements of <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> from theirhome ranges. Combining foray model movement estimates with known domestic sheepgrazing areas (allotments), a Risk of Contact Model estimated <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> contact rateswith domestic sheep allotments. Finally, we used demographic and epidemiologic data toconstruct population and disease transmission models (Disease Model), which we usedto estimate <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> persistence under each alternative grazing scenario. Depend-ing on the probability of disease transmission following interspecies contact, extirpationprobabilities for the seven <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> herds examined here ranged from 20 % to 100 %.

40|$|Bronchopneumonia is a {{population}} limiting disease of <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> (Ovis canadensis) {{that has been}} associated with contact with domestic Caprinae. The disease is polymicrobial but is initiated by Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae, which is commonly carried by both domestic sheep (O. aries) and goats (Capra aegagrus hircus). However, while previous <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> comingling studies with domestic sheep have resulted in nearly 100 % pneumonia mortality, only sporadic occurrence of fatal pneumonia was reported from previous comingling studies with domestic goats. Here, we evaluated the ability of domestic goats of defined M. ovipneumoniae carriage status to induce pneumonia in comingled <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep.</b> In experiment 1, three <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> naÃ¯ve to M. ovipneumoniae developed non-fatal respiratory disease (coughing, nasal discharge) following comingling with three naturally M. ovipneumoniae-colonized domestic goats.

40|$|The {{ecology of}} <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> in Canyonlands National Park, Utah was {{investigated}} between July 1974 and December 1975. Primary objectives {{of this study}} were: (1) to determine the distribution and abundance of <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> in the Park; (2) {{to examine the effects}} of human encroachment, and (3) to determine key habitat factors in relation to <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> movements. Data were collected by ground and aerial surveys. There were between 60 and 100 <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> in the Island in the Sky District and between 20 and 30 in the Needles District. <b>Bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> distribution was closely related to the history of livestock grazing and landform characteristics of the canyons. Human activities have restricted bighorn ewe distribution more than ram distribution. Bighorn ewes were observed in canyons which were not used by domestic livestock or where much of the canyon was isolated from domestic livestock. Deer and <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> demonstrated different landform preferences. Deer occupied large level areas, washes, and river bottoms. <b>Bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> remained on the more rugged terrain, moving to level areas to feed. In canyons which were completely isolated from deer and livestock, <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> preferred t he broad level areas and washes. Bighorn ewes did not demonstrate seasonal movements, whereas rams had definite movement patterns. In the southern portion of the Island in the Sky District, rams formed small bands and remained in a series of four canyons throughout the late winter and spring. In June, these rams dispersed individually or in pairs to higher elevations. During October they returned to the canyons below the White Rim to search for ewes. In the eastern portion of the Island in the Sky District, mature rams remained below the White Rim only during the rut, dispersing to higher elevations for the rest of the year. Physical barriers may minimize the impact of tourism upon <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep.</b> If <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> were above or unable to see the source of disturbance, the impact was not as great as when bighorn were able to see the source. This may explain the tendency for bighorn ewes to quickly retreat when vehicles approached them on the White Rim Road where few physical barriers are present. Human encroachment also decreases the energy intake and increases the energy output of <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep.</b> <b>Bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> appear to be at equilibrium with the current range they inhabit. The National Park Service should monitor the use of the White Rim Road to evaluate effects on the <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> and restrict hiking below the White Rim to minimize stress on the <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> within this range. Studies should be initiated to investigate the <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> expansion of its range within the Park as a result of the cessation of lives tock grazing, and the role tourism plays in limiting it...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} of <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> in Mexico {{is not based}} on empirical data. We conducted phone interviews and a literature review to determine published information on desert <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> in Mexico. Most information on <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> was published prior to 1983 and focused on population size and structure. We concluded that desert <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> in Mexico are in need of further research. To provide better management to <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep,</b> research needs to focus on basic life history strategies (e. g., minimum viable population size, diet, habitat relationships, movements, predation, diseases, and metapopulation dynamics). <b>Bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> in Mexico have been scarcely studied. We conducted a habitat use study in Rancho el Plomito, Sonora, Mexico from April 1997 to December 1998 and the data were used to determine causes of sexual segregation. Vegetation associations were not used according to their availability. Segregated females formed larger groups, were closer to escape terrain and occupied more rugged areas than males. Sexual segregation exhibited by desert <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> in Rancho el Plomito may result from different energetic and reproductive strategies for males and females. Females tend to optimize conditions suitable for rearing offspring and males maximize body condition. <b>Bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> in Mexico are important game animals and are confined to scattered populations (Villa 1. 959). Little research has been conducted on desert <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> and consequently the species is listed in appendix II of CITES (i. e., vulnerable) (Valdez 1997). Tarangb and Krausman (1997) emphasized food selection as a fundamental research topic for the species in Mexico. We conducted a study of diet composition in Sonora, Mexico from April 1997 to December 1998. We identified 41 plant species consumed by desert <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep.</b> The mean annual diet was composed of browse, forbs, succulents, and grasses. Composition of forage categories in diets of males and females was similar. The coefficient of overlap (Morisita 1959) of diets of male and female bighorns for seasons indicated significant overlap. Sexual segregation of desert <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> in Sonora, Mexico was not related to forage selection (i. e., botanical composition, forage quality), and suggested that other factors (i. e., physiographic characteristics) were responsible for this segregation...|$|R
40|$|Twelve desert <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) were {{captured}} 12 - 14 November 1979 in the Black Mountains, western Arizona, and translocated to a 283 ha enclosure in the Virgin Mountains, northwestern Arizona. I studied habitat and foraging relationships {{of the population}} from November 1979 to December 1981. My objectives were to investigate productivity, group characteristics and habitat use, intraspecific comparisons of diet, diet overlap with cattle, forage availability and use, diet diversity, and plant quality. Seven and 8 females in the enclosure had lambs in 1980 and 1981, respectively. Mean group size was largest in spring, coincident with the peak of lambing. The number of mixed sex groups decreased in spring and summer when adult females did not associate with adult males. The number of mixed sex groups were highest in fall and winter due to rut and post-rut aggregations. The 4 vegetation associations in the enclosure were used in proportion to availability except by adult females and lambs in spring-summer 1981. Grasses, forbs, and browse were equally important in the annual diets of bighorn sheep; the use of succulents was secondary. Browse and grasses comprised most of the cattle diet (45. 4 % and 40. 1 %, respectively) followed by forbs (13. 1 %). Intraspecific differences in <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> diets were not significant. <b>Bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> and cattle diets did not overlap significantly and <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> diets were more diverse. <b>Bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> did not eat 8 plant species in proportion to their occurrence in the enclosure. Habitat conditions and behavior patterns of <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> in the enclosure were similar to free-ranging populations. However, range conditions in the enclosure were excellent, predators were controlled, and potential competitors were excluded. The reproductive potential of desert <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> was obtained. Although I confirmed a relationship between <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> diet and plant nutrition, no intraspecific differences in seasonal nutrition requirements were established. In addition, dietary overlap between <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> and cattle was not significant; these data have important management implications for future <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> introductions onto traditional livestock grazing areas...|$|R
40|$|Strong {{evidence}} exists indicating domestic sheep (Ovis aries) can infect Rocky Mountain <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> (Ovis canadensis canadensis), a United States Forest Service (USFS) Region 4 sensitive species, with pneumonia (Callan 1991; Foreyt 1989, 1992, 1994; Foreyt and Lagerquist 1996; George et al 2008; Wehausen et al. 2011). Since {{the transmission of}} the pneumonic bacteria between the domestic and wild sheep {{is a result of}} <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> coming into contact with the bacteria carried in the mucous membranes of the domestic <b>sheep,</b> <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> at risk of initially contracting the bacteria are those individuals that enter areas currently being grazed or that have been recently grazed by domestic sheep (Foreyt 1990; Jessup 1985; Martin et al. 1996; Monello et al. 2001; Rudolph et al. 2003). The issue is further compounded when infected <b>bighorn</b> <b>sheep</b> return to their herd and have the potential to spread the bacteria to other members, which can result in substantial mortality (Shackleton et al. 1999).
