These same areas are often undergoing extensive forest conversion and degradation. While causality has generally not been established, the scientific literature makes it abundantly clear that the juxtaposition of deprivation, deforestation, and disease is not pure coincidence. We chart a course for using transdisciplinary research to develop more effective policies to control malaria, protect forests, and alleviate poverty. First describing the malaria problem, including its etiologic roots, and its social toll, the paper then examines some shortcomings of contemporary societal responses.

Han et al. [3] introduce a game-based power minimization model in a multi-cell OFDMA system. Wu et al. [4] and Yu et al. [5] focus on a subcarrier and power allocation scheme in uplink OFDMA systems, where each user {{not only has the}} different power constraint, but also is limited by different rate requirements. In [6], under a cooperative OFDMA scenario, the authors build up the interference channel model based on amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) modes, and study power control scheme based on a two-stage game. But, the studies in [3, 6] do not take subcarrier allocation into account, and in [3] the authors do not introduce the relay nodes. Authors of [4 – 6] consider a single-cell scenario, i.e. absence of consideration of inter-cell interference. Lee and Yum [7] introduce a novel framework to find the necessary and sufficient condition for Pareto-efficiency. The resource allocation algorithm developed by Lang et al. [8] aims at minimizing the users' transmitting power in a multi-cell OFDMA system based on game theory under the constraint of the peak value of power. However, this algorithm cannot ensure convergence. Yu et al.

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Malaria is the world’s most {{important}} parasitic infectious disease, {{and is a}} major cause of mortality and morbidity in many developing countries. In this dissertation I study the interaction of malaria and economic development at both the macro- and micro-economic levels. In the first essay I examine the economic impact of malaria on income per capita using cross-country time-series data for 100 malaria prone countries between the years 1985 and 2001. I try to explain the so-called “malaria gap,” which refers a general difference (gap) in parameter estimates found between macro- and <b>micro-economic</b> <b>studies</b> of the impact of malaria on economic well-being. By using more detailed data and controlling for a larger number of economic determinants of malaria than previous macro-economic studies, I am able to resolve most of the “malaria gap” associated with earlier studies in the literature. I show that the impact of malaria on economic well-being is statistically significant but fairly small, which coincides with the findings of certain recent micro-level studies. Policy implications of these empirical findings are discussed. In the second essay I turn my focus to the fact that malaria itself is an endogenous variable over which households and government have some control. I start with simple plots of data that show that malaria has a negative correlation with national income per capita, whether looking across countries at a point in time, or looking at a single country over time. Some countries have moved steadily over time from an equilibrium characterized by low income and high malaria, to a new equilibrium with a relatively high income and low rate of malaria. I develop and estimate a simultaneous equations model to explain these relationships. I distinguish three potential causal chains: the ability for decreases in malaria to increase income, the ability for increases in income to reduce malaria (reverse causality), and external factors that may lead to both higher income and lower malaria (incidental association). I find that changes in income have a much stronger effect on malaria incidence than the other way around. While a 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{liberalisation}} {{process in}} developing and transition countries in the 1980 s and 1990 s was accompanied by an exponential increase in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows. The interest of developing countries in attracting FDI {{is based on the}} belief that FDI contributes importantly to economic growth and to the overall development of the host country. Theoretical arguments state that FDI contributes to economic growth both directly – through the accumulation of capital and technological know-how – and indirectly – through technology and knowledge spillovers to domestic firms in the host economy. Empirical cross-country studies find a strong positive relationship between FDI and economic growth, but causality is likely to run in both directions. <b>Micro-economic</b> <b>studies</b> find evidence of positive vertical spillovers to suppliers to and buyers from Multinational Corporations (MNC). However, horizontal spillovers are not found and seem to be dominated by negative competition effects. The empirical results vary largely across countries, sectors and firms. This indicates that the impact of FDI is very heterogeneous and conditional on factors such as the type of FDI, the economic sector and the absorptive capacity of the host economy. It seems that – if the conditions are right – FDI can be an important engine of economic growth. Furthermore, FDI may contribute to poverty reduction in the long run through economic growth impact, employment creation, wage pressure and increased tax revenues - although also here the effect is heterogeneous. The impact of FDI on inequality between countries is unclear, with mixed empirical evidence. Within a country, it seems likely that FDI increases inequality in the short run. However, when directed towards less skill-intensive sectors and the poor groups of society – for example FDI in agribusiness in rural areas – FDI may reduce inequality. The evidence is also mixed on gender inequality. When looking at some non-economic indicators of human development, such as human rights, labour standards and the environment, FDI seems to create a ‘race to the top’ rather than a ‘race to the bottom’. FDI is thus not a simple solution for enhancing growth. But when the conditions are right, it can provide an important contribution to human development. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{developing}} countries, many household {{are exposed}} to high risk, uncertainties and crises, which not only causes of poverty, but also a path to <b>micro-economic</b> downturn. <b>Studies</b> have shown that households who have the fewest instruments {{to deal with these}} risks are considered poor. In some cases, they are seen as the most vulnerable. In Malaysia, both poverty and a wide variety of risks are widespread among household member, especially in the rural areas. The present research aims to examine rural households’ vulnerability to poverty using longitudinal data set of three waves. The present study developed and designed (an alternative to panel data) modules in cross-sectional surveys with recall questions {{that can be used to}} tract a households’ history and its evolution along various welfare dimensions. The study aims, in general, to analyse the link between exposure to risks and vulnerability to poverty of rural households in Kelantan and Terengganu. Data was collected from a three-round panel survey undertaken at 6 month interval to allow measurement of seasonal variation in behaviour and outcome and to balance both cross-sectional and time series requirements of panel data. 460 respondents were interviewed in the first round, but only 301 questionnaires in the last round were valid for data analysis. The findings illustrated that fighting future poverty is not only to incorporate monetary measure but also non -monetary measure need to be merged. The lack of access to assets and resources and the exposure to threats have made the process of recovering from poverty unsuccessful. Assets are regarded as the core element of vulnerability reduction. Both covariate and idiosyncratic risks are central causes behind a household future vulnerability.

40|$|Presented at the GLOBELICS 6 th International Conference 2008 22 - 24 September, Mexico City, Mexico. This paper explores macro-, and meso-economic forces shaping {{search and}} explorative {{behaviour}} {{at the firm}} level. In particular, we focus on top-down selection mechanisms (both direct and indirect) that modify the rate and direction of technological change, {{as well as the}} nature of technological learning at the <b>micro-economic</b> level. <b>Studies</b> on economic development in developing countries focus increasingly on the concepts of technological learning and technology systems. It is well accepted that fundamental causes of differences in long term economic performance expresses technological asymmetries at the firm and sectoral level (Dosi, Pavitt and Soete, 1990; Fagerberg, 1994). Given that technological learning is embedded in production chains, knowledge networks, and institutions, patterns of accumulation of technological capabilities depend in turn on related systems of innovation (Lundvall, 1992; Nelson, 1993). Opportunities for catching-up and narrowing technological asymmetries depend as well on the particular innovation regime, the rules govern search and innovative behaviour that in a particular industry and in a particular time (Nelson and Winter, 1982; Malerba and Orsenigo, 1995). However, macro-to-micro causality has been largely excluded in these fundamental explanations of economic performance (see Cimoli and Katz, 2002). Macroeconomic environments determining levels and growth rates of key variables can influence directly the rates of technology absorption and local innovation through traditional channels like relative prices of capital, capital turnover rates, market size and growth rates, etc. Next to these quantitative impacts, we argue, macroeconomic settings can also affect the nature of technical change, by influencing market- and firm-level selection mechanisms that govern an economy's capacity of generating variety. Following Nelson and Winter (1982) model of search and selection, we develop an analytic framework that links explicitly micro-level behaviour and learning, with macroeconomic selection mechanisms. In turn, we show how macro-to-micro causation can bias technological behaviour into certain directions, reinforcing cumulative causation and path-dependent features of technological learning. Next, we examine the conditions under which adverse selection environments can generate development traps of slow economic growth, and slow variety generation. In circumstances where active competition and market transference mechanisms operate in a relatively fluid manner across borders, economic resilience is crucial for preventing economic systems to rely purely on static advantages that may result socially and environmentally deleterious in the long term. Finally, we argue how the learning restrictions set by astringent selection environments can and have been overcome under certain innovation regimes...|$|R
40|$|Although {{this paper}} is, ostensibly, a macro- and <b>micro-economic</b> {{historical}} <b>study</b> {{of competition in}} the West European woollen textile ind ustries, in France, the Low Countries, England, Italy, and Iberia (Catalonia and Aragon), and of their related wool and cloth trades, covering all of Europe and the Mediterranean basin, from the eleventh to early sixteenth centuries, this paper is actually focused upon four fundamental inter-related questions and theses set forth to furnish some answers to the problems posed: (1) It seeks {{to explain why the}} textile industries of the Low Countries [...] Flanders above all [...] gained, held, but then ultimately lost their dominance in the production and export of luxury woollen textiles, those based upon the production of fine English wools, the finest before the advent of improved Spanish merino wools, by the 16 th century (from sheep whose modern descendants provide the world s best quality wools today). (2) It seeks to show why, from the early 14 th to mid 15 th centuries, the majority of the prominent textile industries in Western Europe were forced to abandon export-oriented production of cheap, light, mass-market textiles, especially says and other semi-worsted fabrics, formerly sent to distant international markets, in order to concentrate more fully upon far higher-priced luxury woollen textiles (those with a far-higher value:weight ratio); and why the components of these industries were transformed from their former role essentially as passive price-takers to become, though fewer in number as survivors, aggressive price-makers, engaging in fierce monopolistic competition. The model employed to explain this industrial and commercial transformation is essentially a North-based transactions-cost model: to demonstrate that, for most of western Europe from the 1290 s to the 1450 s, the spreading stain of chronic, widespread and violent warfare, involving far greater state involvement in fiscal, monetary, and trade policies, raised the transport, marketing, and transaction costs of long-distant trade in cheap textiles to prohibitive levels: i. e. that so many of these West European producers found that only the trade in luxury textiles could bear the freight and continue to be profitable, for much of the later medieval-era, at least for the few survivors. At the same time, changes in wealth and income distributions resulting from these structural economic changes favoured sales of luxury cloths. (3) It seeks to explain why and how the English cloth industry, producing good quality woollen textiles, but with an export trade aimed at lower-echelon luxury markets, finally gained supremacy, by the late 15 th century, over the Low Countries; and how the Low Countries s textile industries, forced to obey the law of comparative advantage, so successfully engaged in and prospered from a revived sayetteries industry based on producing, once again, those lighter, cheaper semi-worsted textiles. Contrary to the traditional theories that still ascribe the English success to a combination of rural locations and technological innovations (water-driven fulling-mills), this paper argue that the ultimate English victory was instead based upon: (i) the unintended consequences of fiscal policies, in tax differentials imposed on the wool- and cloth-export trades; but more so, given the century that it took the English to gain this victory, (ii) structural changes in the European international economy that brought about the restoration of relative security, demographic and economic revival, changes in income distributions and market demand, innovations in overland transport and marketing, falling transaction costs, and new continental trade routes, based on South Germany, the Rhineland, and the Brabant Fairs that favoured the English cloth trade over its chief Flemish, Brabantine, and Dutch (and Italian) rivals. (4) This paper also revisits the proto-industrialization thesis and the related debates about the advantages of rural vs. urban location: to show that even for the victorious English cloth industry, and also for the Flemish sayetteries and related worsted industries, the chief participants in their respective international textile trades were fundamentally more urban than rural based (despite a rural-urban symbiosis in the production processes). ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} {{theoretical}} section the author regrets that economic theory and economic policy of all schools ignore {{or at least}} neglect such 2 ̆ 7 impure 2 ̆ 7 phenomena as are part-time agricultural/non-agricultural farms. With economic development their number is rapidly increasing and this leads to various consequences {{which tend to be}} neglected or ignored by theory. However Marxist economic thought should give them more attention. As is known, Marx investigated what is called pure or abstract capitalism with its three basic classes: capitalists, workers, and land-owners. It was only this abstraction from a multitude of individual, unessential non-average and untypical elements, independently from governmental interference, that enabled him to discover the fundamental laws of capitalism. However, he did not limit himself to that alone but also investigated (especially in »Capital« I I I) concrete capitalism and industrial, commercial and financial bourgeoisie and its environment and historical appearance under the influence of numerous other economic and non-economic, sociological and political factors. Similarly, Lenin analysed the development of capitalism in Russia in the light of concrete geographical and historical conditions; however he believed that capitalist elements often derive from various non-capitalist and non-conomic circumstances. Even the regular mechanism of capitalist economic growth is based on an untypical factor, — the »extra surplus-value«, which derives from the exploitation of new technical invenions until the inventions become generally applied. Thus this exceptional factor tended to promote general progress. Another exceptional factor is the value and price of labour. Originally this was established {{on the basis of the}} value of the means of subsistence of the worker and his family, but with the introduction of machinery it has been devaluated and reduced to the value of means of subsistence of the worker alone. In the recent stage of economic development and full employment, the shorter working day and higher wages allow the employment of several family members and a higher evaluation of each individual, and this leads to a comparatively high level of family income and increased spending in general. The author feels that the effects of this family income on the market, on the purchase power, on the consumers’ preferences and choices, on the elasticity of consumer goods, and on Engels’s laws have not been adequately studied, especially in the conditions of poor, non-developed regions with a highly irregular employment of individual members of the family. The author then goes on to discuss the special combination of multiple job- -holding, the combination of agricultural with non-agricultural occupations within one household or, more precisely, of work on the farm and work outside it. This phenomenon which generally accompanies the economic development of agriculture, calls for a wider investigation of its importance and implications and especially for a reply to the question whether it is an obstacle to, or a promoter of, economic growth on a national scale. Local monographs, descriptions and <b>micro-economic</b> <b>studies</b> on the subject are already available. The author stresses the substantial differences between the standards of living of part-time and agricultural/non-agricultural households in the past (when the classical peasants/workers formed the poorest population strata) and nowadays (when they are among the wealthiest people in rural areas). In the past their characteristics were a long working day, a long walk to the place of work, and a heavy work load on the housewife, while nowadays, at least in developed countries, the situation is different: a shorter working day and a short working week, quick and often free transportation to the job, electricity and labour-saving devices in the home, public care for children, and a higher level of earnings from employment outside the farm, — all of which makes possible saving and investment in the holding. The author excludes from his study large agricultural holdings linked with non-agricultural activities, considering them simply a vertical concentration of capital; he also excludes the garden plots of kolkhoz peasants as not belonging into the category of small part-time farmers and workers/peasants. Since lack of statistical information is one of the main obstacles to economic research in this field, the author, in the second section of the study, deals with the methodological difficulties in establishing the number of part-time farms or agricultural holdings with an additional, external income. Until recently nothing reliable could be said about them on an international level. However, the situation has substantially improved since the 1970 World Census of Agriculture, although the respective data are not very comparable between different countries, especially those with different types of census and enquiry. This is demonstrated by instances from France and Yugoslavia: the differences were due to the non-uniformity of definitions and types of census. One of the main problems is the wide distribution of twin occupations: (a) In most Western countries (particularly in the English or German speaking region) only one type is recognized, i. e. where the farm serves as a supplementary, secondary occupation (the real »part-time farm«, »der landwirtschaftliche Nebenerwerbsbetrieb «; this type corresponds to the »part-time farm type II« in Japanese literature); (b) In certain other countries those persons are also regarded as multiple-job- -holders whose main occupation is farming but who also earn a certain amount of income outside the farm either by part-time or by full-time work (»peasant/worker«, »der landwirtschaftliche Zuerwerbsbetrieb«; this type corresponds to the »part-time farm type I« in Japanese literature). The author believes it is wrong to ignore »type b« and include it among full-time »pure« farmers, but he admits that in agricultural censuses it is difficult to identify holdings of type »b«. The second difficulty is the selection of a criterion for identification: working time (man-days, man-hours) or income? Different criteria lead to different results. The author is in favour of a combination of both criteria, as this is done in the German and Belgian censuses. The third problem is the question whose work should be considered: the work of the holder alone (U. S., Canada), of the holder and/or his wife, or of other active members of the household. The author supports the last alternative. The first criterion is to some extent corrected by considering the value of the sale of products. Most of the European censuses, however, make possible a detailed insight into the activity structure of the family. The third section contains statistics showing trends in the number and distribution of part-time farms in the U. S., Canada, Germany, France and Japan and some data on Yugoslavia, while the fourth section discusses the statistical data. As regards the well-known issue whether part-time farms is a phenomenon which accompanies a low level of economic development marked by low-income agriculture and low-income industry, but which disappears in the higher stages of economic growth, the author believes that recent development have refuted this view. In countries with a high average size of farm such as North America and Oceania the absolute number both of farms and of part-time farms is decreasing. The same applies to the developed regions of Central and Western Europe with their traditionally overpopulated, small-sized agricultural holdings whose adjustment to the new situation is slowed down to some extent by interventionary measures. Nevertheless, the number of marginal medium-sized farms continues increasing, and the link between part-time farms and farms with supplementary income earned outside the holding (. Nebenerwerbsbetriebe and Zuerwerbsbetriebe) is established on a higher level. Thus part-time farms as an institution are inevitable concomitants of economic growth at its various levels. As an individual phenomenon, however, the part-time farm is generally abandoned (or turned into a garden plot) in the third or fourth generations. (However, there exist certain regions where the tradition of part-time farming is maintained for several generations (e. g. wine growing for prestige reasons), certain mining regions, etc.) The f i f t h section contains the author 2 ̆ 7 s views on part-time farms or with supplementary sources of income: (a) Productivity of part-time farms. Although a nation’s agricultural supply cannot rely on these farms, and although these farms are generally below the level of productivity of 2 ̆ 7 purely 2 ̆ 7 agricultural farms of comparable size, the productivity of part-time farms under certain conditions can become equal or even higher than is that of the corresponding category of purely agricultural farms. This is particularly true if more of the money earned outside the farm is invested in agriculture and if the holder concentrates on the market production of only a few instead of many different crops. Here the principles of economies of scale have only a comparative value, and the author believes this to be fully compatible with Marx 2 ̆ 7 s teachings; (b) Competition in the market. In low-income countries, production on part- -time farms appears to have a promoting effect on industrialization because it lessens the need for food imports and saves the country considerable foreign exchange funds. In certain developed countries, part-time farmers are made responsible for overproduction and the fall of market prices. The real problem, however, is not only one of reducing production but also of financing the distribution as long as the total world food production continues to be exceeded by demand; (c) The acceleration exodus of part-time farmers and small full-time farmers leaves some less fertile, especially hilly regions deserted and exposed either to soil erosion or to a wild growth of bushes and woods. The EEC countries are trying to control the situation by various measures including the introduction of suitable local industries for part-time farmers, the development of tourism, etc.; (d) The existence of part-time farms and the daily commuting from villages to towns and industrial centres helps to relieve some of the tensions between rural and urban areas and may help to reduce differences between town and country in die future. Tn the most highly developed countries a »back to land« movement has recently been spreading among certain strata of the population; (e) Taking it all in all, small part-time farms offer many factors which can have a favourable effect on the processes of economic development and industrialization and on the development of a socialist society. It should be the task of economists, sociologists, politicians and legislators to see that this stratum is not left without assistance and long-term orientation, and to establish and promote those favourable elements which are likely to speed up national development and well being...|$|R
