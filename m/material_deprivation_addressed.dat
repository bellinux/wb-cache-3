40|$|Introduction. Socioeconomic inequalities {{affecting}} {{health are}} of major importance in Europe. The literature enhances {{the role of}} social determinants of health, such as socioeconomic characteristics and urbanization, to achieve health equity. Yet, {{there is still much}} to know, mainly concerning the association between cause-specific mortality and several social determinants, especially in metropolitan areas. /nThis study aims to describe the geographical pattern of cause-specific mortality in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA), at small area level (parishes), and analyses the statistical association between mortality risk and health determinants (<b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> and urbanization level). Fourteen causes have been selected, representing almost 60 % of total mortality between 1995 and 2008, particularly those associated with urbanization and <b>material</b> <b>deprivation.</b> /nMethods. A cross-sectional ecological study was carried out. Using a hierarchical Bayesian spatial model, we estimated sex–specific smoothed Standardized Mortality Ratios (sSMR) and measured the relative risks (RR), and 95 % credible intervals, for cause-specific mortality relative to 1. urbanization level, 2. <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> and 3. <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> adjusted by urbanization. /nResults. The statistical association between mortality and <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> and between mortality and urbanization changes by cause of death and sex. Dementia and MN larynx, trachea, bronchus and lung are the causes of death showing higher relative risk associated with urbanization. Infectious and parasitic diseases, Chronic liver disease and Diabetes are the causes of death presenting higher relative risk associated with <b>material</b> <b>deprivation.</b> Ischemic heart disease was the only cause with a statistical association with both determinants, and MN female breast was the only without any statistical association. Urbanization level reduces the impact of <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> for most of the causes of death. Men face a higher impact of <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> and urbanization level, than women, in most cause-specific mortality, even when considering the adjusted model. /nConclusions. Our findings explore the specific pattern of fourteen causes of death in LMA and reveals small areas with an excess risk of mortality associated with <b>material</b> <b>deprivation,</b> thereby identifying problematic areas that could potentially benefit from public policies effecting social inequalities.

Longitudinal data on <b>material</b> <b>deprivation,</b> longstanding illness and limiting longstanding illness enables investigations {{of the effects of}} <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> on risk of limiting longstanding illness. This study investigates whether a shift from affording to not affording a car predicts the probability of limiting longstanding ill (LLSI). Methods The 2008 – 2011 longitudinal panel of Statistics on Income, Social Inclusion and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) is utilised. Longitudinal fixed effects logit models are applied, using LLSI as dependent variable. Transition from affording a car to not affording a car is used as a proxy for <b>material</b> <b>deprivation.</b> All models are controlled for whether the person becomes longstanding ill (LSI) as well as other time-variant covariates that could affect the results. Results The analysis shows a statistically significant increased odds ratio of LLSI when individuals no longer can afford a car, after controlling for confounders and LSI in the previous year (1. 129, CI[*]=[*] 1. 022 – 1. 248). However, when restricting the sample to observations where respondents report longstanding illness the results are no longer significant (1. 032, CI[*]=[*] 0. 910 – 1. 171). Conclusion The results indicate an individual level effect of <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> on LLSI, suggesting that material resources can affect {{the consequences of}} ill health...|$|R

In order to approximate chronic <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> we use a three-step index of chronic cumulative disadvantage. In the first step, population members deprived in three domains of static <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> are identified. In the second step, the extent of cumulative disadvantage of these individuals is examined and, in the final step, persons suffering from chronic cumulative disadvantage over the period 2005 - 2008 are identified, by aggregating the information on static cumulative disadvantage in each year covered. Then, we examine the overlap between chronic <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> and (smoothed) longitudinal poverty. The results reveal considerable differences across EU countries regarding both the level {{and the structure of}} the population at high risk of chronic <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> and longitudinal poverty. Finally, each country's population is subdivided into mutually exhaustive and exclusive groups according to the characteristics of the population member, according to seven alternative criteria: Sex, age employment status and education level of the household's reference person, age and education of the individual and household type. The results of the analysis reveal a number of qualitative similarities and quantitative differences across EU member states. Nevertheless, in almost all countries under examination, lack of full employment by the individual or, especially, by the household's reference person, low educational qualifications, being a member of a lone parent household or living in a household headed by a woman or by a very young or, to a lesser extent, an elderly person, lead to high risks of chronic <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> as well as longitudinal poverty...|$|R

Moreover, collecting information about <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> is as difficult as collecting information on income and consumption and therefore, the decreasing trend may also be a result of measurement error, e.g., if respondents increasingly give positive answers the more often they are asked for their possessions and activities.|$|R

During the observation period, Germany experienced {{a significant increase in}} average real incomes and employment, accompanied by a decrease of absolute income poverty as measured by the at-risk-of-poverty rate anchored at a fixed moment in time. PASS collects information on <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> with a list of 26 possessions and activities. The article discusses the difficulties of measuring <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> and identifies several sources of measurement error and selection bias. However, even when controlling for such errors and biases, regression models for different deprivation indices show a significant downward trend in <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> for the German resident population. Given the simultaneous decrease in absolute income poverty, it is concluded that measures of <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> behave like absolute income poverty indicators if the list of possessions and activities is not updated to changed living standard standards in society. A similar downward trend is observed also for individuals receiving basic income support. Moreover, supported individuals report deprivation differently depending on survey mode and number of previous panel interviews, raising the question of measurement equivalence in this subgroup.|$|R
30|$|Measures of <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> are an {{essential}} part of Eurostat’s regular statistical reporting on income and living conditions. The indicator is defined “as the percentage of population with an enforced lack of at least three out of nine <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> items in the ‘economic strain and durables’ dimension” (Eurostat 2018). Trend analyses of <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> often find a long-term decline of corresponding deprivation measures, even when controlling for socio-economic changes of the population (Berthoud and Bryan 2011; Figari 2012; Groh-Samberg and Goebel 2007). In Germany, according to Eurostat data, this indicator dropped from 13.5 % in 2006 to 9.7 % in 2016 (Eurostat 2018). Such a drop in <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> in the 2000 s and 2010 s is surprising given increasing poverty trends in the same period using either income or consumption as poverty indicators (Grabka and Goebel 2017; Hörstermann 2016). However, what is different from earlier periods is a significant increase of employment with mandatory social insurance coupled with a similarly large decrease of registered unemployment (Bundesamt et al. 2016, pp. 126 – 149). Earlier studies have shown that rising unemployment results in a positive deprivation trend (Andreß 2006).|$|R

Methods: Computerised data relating to gender, attendance date and resident postcode of all patients aged 11 - 17 years who received treatment for violence-related injuries at seven emergency departments (ED) in South Wales over 12 months, 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2006, were studied.

Results: Altogether 699 (475 boys; 224 girls) adolescents aged 11 - 17 years resident in Cardiff, Swansea and Newport attended ED in South Wales following violence. Boys and girls living in the most deprived areas had higher assault injury rates compared with those living in the most affluent areas. In the context of sustaining violence-related injury, <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> affected girls aged 11 - 17 years to a much greater extent (Cardiff most deprived vs most affluent rate ratio 6. 31, Swansea 10. 11, Newport 2. 90) than boys of the same age group (Cardiff most deprived vs most affluent rate ratio 2. 02, Swansea 7. 74, Newport 1. 74).

Questionnaire interviews were used {{to collect data on}} self-rated health in the last 12 months, education, marital status, perceived control based on nine questions, and <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> based on availability of food, clothing and heating. For each population, two ecological measures of material inequalities were available: an inequality score estimated from the survey data as the distance between the 90 th and 10 th percentiles of <b>material</b> <b>deprivation,</b> and Gini coefficient from published sources. Data on 5330 men and women aged 20 - 60 were analysed. Prevalence of poor health (worse than average) varied between 8 % in Czechs and 19 % in Hungarians. The age-sex-adjusted odds ratio for university vs primary education was 0. 36 (0. 26 - 0. 49); odds ratios per 1 standard deviation increase in perceived control and in <b>material</b> <b>deprivation</b> were 0. 58 (95 % CI 0. 48 - 0. 69) and 1. 51 (1. 40 - 1. 63), respectively. The odds ratio for an increase in inequality equivalent to the difference between the most and the least unequal populations was 1. 49 (0. 88 - 2. 52) using the material inequality score and 1. 41 (0. 91 - 2. 20) using the Gini coefficient.
