50|$|The Renault-sourced 1.7 litre engine {{suffers from}} a {{well-known}} problem where the carburetor <b>mounting</b> <b>flange</b> warps due to engine heat, causing a small air leak and subsequent running problems. This is easy to fix, requiring minor machining of the mating faces.|$|E

50|$|If the {{difference}} is small, other factors, such as the diameters of the <b>mounting</b> <b>flanges</b> of the two systems, come into play as well. Lens adapters are generally easier to make when the camera body has a large lens mount.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the [...] "Keystone" [...] module may {{be traced back to}} US Patent 4261633 of Aug 27, 1979 for a [...] "Wiring module for {{telephone}} jack" [...] - by Amp Incorporated.The module referred to in that patent was affixed by [...] "A pair of diagonally inclined <b>mounting</b> <b>flanges</b> (which) include stepped, panel bearing surfaces [...]. at the outer free ends thereof." [...] The unit was [...] "inserted through the panel opening, with the sides of the opening resiliently deflecting the (<b>mounting</b> <b>flanges),</b> until they pass through the opening and spring outwardly away from the remainder of the housing, with the panel bearing surfaces [...]. thereof seated against the front surface of the panel".|$|R
50|$|Dimensions {{and design}} of valve <b>mounting</b> <b>flange</b> and valve {{attachments}} are stipulated in the standards EN ISO 5210 for multi-turn actuators or EN ISO 5211 for part-turn actuators. The design of valve attachments for linear actuators is generally based on DIN 3358.|$|E
50|$|Because the 911 {{air-cooled}} crankcase {{uses the}} Porsche 356 engine to transmission <b>mounting</b> <b>flange</b> configuration, the 996 GT3 used a manual gearbox also of air-cooled 911 heritage. This gearbox has interchangeable gear ratios {{and is more}} durable making it more suitable for racing than the standard 911 type 996 gearbox.|$|E
50|$|On 17 March 2017, {{the right}} {{propeller}} sheared off a Regional Express Saab 340B, tail number VH-NRX, while operating flight ZL768 from Albury to Sydney. The pilot made a pan-pan call but {{was able to}} land the plane without incident. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau after investigating found a fatigue crack in the engine’s propeller <b>mounting</b> <b>flange.</b>|$|E
50|$|The forward {{fuselage}} (cockpit) is constructed of Kevlar, carbon and glass fiber laminate, reinforced by a double {{skin on the}} sides with integrated surrounding canopy frame and seat pan <b>mounting</b> <b>flanges.</b> The single-piece canopy hinges sideways and opens to the right. The aft fuselage section is constructed of a pure carbon fiber monolithic shell, stiffened by carbon fiber/foam core bulkheads and glass fiber webs.|$|R
50|$|The Pentax K-F mount added five {{electrical}} contact pins protruding {{through the lens}} <b>mount</b> <b>flange</b> at the 5 o'clock position (when viewing the ME F body from the front) to the original Pentax K mount (introduced 1975) to pass focus control information between the camera and the lens. The Pentax K-AF and K-AF2 autofocus lens mounts (introduced 1987 and 1991, respectively) have contacts of different number, position and function, and therefore the 35mm-70mm AF Zoom cannot autofocus on any other Pentax SLR.|$|R
50|$|The B4-mount has {{its image}} {{projected}} at 48 mm behind the lens <b>mount</b> <b>flange</b> (in air). The standard defines that a prism splits {{the light to}} form separate images planes for the colours red, green and blue. A correction for chromatic aberration {{is also part of}} the standard: the red sensor should be 10 μm further, and blue 5 μm further than 48 mm. This fitted well with established TV-camera technology using 3 tubes, and also with 3CCD, an upcoming technology at the time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} {{essentially}} a lightly {{modified version of the}} E-series unit found in the Maxi and Allegro. The main differences over the older engine are to the sump and gearbox <b>mounting</b> <b>flange,</b> which were adapted to accept a traditional [...] "end-on" [...] transmission unit which had been bought from Volkswagen in place of the traditional BMC transmission-in-sump arrangement.|$|E
5000|$|... The {{transmission}} is not interchangeable with a conventional BMC sump mounted manual gearbox. Because {{of an extended}} flywheel <b>mounting</b> <b>flange</b> on the crankshaft, the AP automatic requires to be fitted to its own unique version of the A-series engine. This causes issues for Mini owners wanting to convert to a manual gearbox, since the entire engine has to be changed also.|$|E
50|$|The {{bearing housing}} height has been {{increased}} to improve lubrication; its <b>mounting</b> <b>flange</b> thickness has been substantially increased; {{the geometry of}} {{the top and bottom}} liners in the bearing housing has been altered to further reduce incidence of rocking. Thickness of the sub-chassis was doubled to improve rigidity, reduce flexing and improve control of the relationship between turntable platter and arm. With the new bearing comes a new sub-platter.|$|E
40|$|The CB- 4 is {{designed}} as a connection point between a Watchman portable data collector and permanently installed transducers. Up to 12 transducers in four locations are supported. Permanently mounted transducers are typically used in places where the technician {{is not able to}} easily access the machine due to safety or other considerations. This application note covers installation and use of the CB- 4 remote sensor connection box. Each terminal strip of the CB- 4 represents a triaxial test location that is identified by the bar-code on the front panel. Setting up the test location in the EAV software is exactly the same as if the test location were accessible. Care must be taken in connecting the wires between the transducers and the CB- 4 to ensure orientation of the three axes are correctly defined in the software. Assembly and Mounting 1. Open the enclosure door and remove the top two screws to allow the panel to swing open. Inside are the following parts: a. <b>Mounting</b> <b>flanges</b> and <b>mounting</b> hardware b. Watertight fittings and nuts (12) c. Watertight fitting plugs (11) 2. Install the <b>mounting</b> <b>flanges</b> {{to the bottom of the}} enclosure using the - 20 flat head screws. The mounting holes should extend away from the enclosure, with the mounting hole...|$|R
5000|$|The MFT system {{standard}} specifies {{the lens}} <b>mount</b> <b>flange</b> to image sensor plane distance (flange focal distance) as 20mm, {{which is less}} than half that of typical DSLRs. [...] The effect is that the GH1 body is smaller in every critical dimension, especially depth, and is also lighter weight when compared to a typical DSLR. This 20mm flange to image sensor distance prohibits the practical implementation of the traditional mirror box and pentaprism optical viewfinder of the typical DSLR. The Panasonic electronic viewfinder is the solution to that packaging issue.|$|R
5000|$|The Nikkormat FT3, {{manufactured}} {{for only}} {{several months in}} 1977 (but still available new from dealer stock in 1978), had the shortest production run of any Nippon Kogaku SLR. The FT3 was essentially identical to the FT2 except that it supported Nikkor lenses with the Automatic Indexing (AI) feature (introduced 1977). AI Nikkor lenses had an external [...] "meter coupling ridge" [...] cam on the lens aperture ring that pushed on an external [...] "meter coupling lever" [...] on a ring surrounding the FT3's lens <b>mount</b> <b>flange</b> to transfer lens set aperture information.|$|R
50|$|Kodak {{began using}} mass-produced plastic aspheres in {{viewfinder}} optics in 1957, and the Kodak Ektramax (USA) Pocket Instamatic 110 cartridge film camera had a built-in Kodak Ektar 25mm f/1.9 lens (also a four element Triplet) with a molded plastic aspheric element in 1978 for US$87.50 list. Plastic {{is easy to}} mold into complex shapes that can include an integral <b>mounting</b> <b>flange.</b> However, glass is superior to plastic for lens making in many respects - its refractive index, temperature stability, mechanical strength and variety is higher.|$|E
5000|$|In plumbing, {{a closet}} flange (also {{known as a}} toilet flange) is a pipe fitting (specifically, a type of flange) that both mounts a toilet {{to the floor and}} connects the toilet drain to a drain pipe. The name comes from the term [...] "water closet", the {{traditional}} name for a toilet. A typical closet flange is composed of an ABS or PVC hub with a round steel <b>mounting</b> <b>flange</b> attached to the top. Other styles are made from copper, brass, stainless steel, or pure plastic.|$|E
5000|$|G — Designation for lenses {{without an}} {{aperture}} ring, indicated after the f-number in the name. G lenses retain the mechanical diaphragm coupling of other Nikkors, but the aperture setting {{can only be}} controlled by the camera body. Only autofocus bodies with command dials are capable of controlling G lenses. Older autofocus bodies will work with G lenses in shutter priority and program modes with full opened aperture. Some recent G lenses feature a weatherproofing gasket around the <b>mounting</b> <b>flange.</b> G lenses otherwise have the same characteristics as D lenses.|$|E
50|$|Accessories: Genuine leather case, {{microscope}} adapter, M24 {{lens mount}} TO M39 lens mount adapter for Zenit SLR lenses, with flange to film plane distance of 45.2 mm. M39 LTM <b>mount</b> with <b>flange</b> to film plane distance 28.8 mm not applicable.|$|R
50|$|Early {{cars from}} Jan 1957 to about chassis number 476 in June 1957 still used a column gear change. During their {{production}} run a Deluxe model was offered which was bodily the same but featured polished wheel trims and spinners, tachometer and twin carburettors. The chassis plate {{was similar to}} the Anzani type on the early cars but was later changed to a printed type fitted to the bulkhead above the brake master cylinder. The printed type chassis plate had type ‘SE328’ printed on it. Most of these cars had the three-speed gearbox similar to the Anzani except for the <b>mounting</b> <b>flanges.</b> All of the cars had the sloping leading edges to the doors.|$|R
50|$|MFT {{cameras are}} {{physically}} slimmer than most interchangeable lens cameras because the standard specifies a much reduced lens <b>mount</b> <b>flange</b> to imaging sensor plane distance of 20mm. Typically this so-called flange focal distance is over 40mm on most interchangeable lens cameras. The MFT system design flange focal length distance allows for, {{through use of}} an adapter, the possibility to mount virtually any manufacturer's existing and legacy still camera interchangeable lens (as well as some video and cine lenses) to an MFT body, albeit using manual focus and manual aperture control. For example, many theoretically obsolete 35mm film camera lenses, as well as existing current lenses for APS-C and full frame DSLR's are now usable on MFT cameras.|$|R
5000|$|Transmissions used {{in later}} AMC {{vehicles}} came {{with either a}} 21-spline or a 23-spline output shaft. Transmissions coupled to four-cylinder engines typically used 21-spline output shafts. The 23-spline manual transmission was universal in the Eagle lines and was generally used with six-cylinder applications. All transfer cases were available with inputs matching either 21- or 23-spline shafts, making transmission swaps possible among various models and years. However, the depth of transfercase input and length of trans output (measured from the <b>mounting</b> <b>flange)</b> changed, and there is 15/16" [...] difference between early and late models.|$|E
50|$|For an {{interchangeable}} lens camera, the flange focal distance (FFD) (also {{known as the}} flange-to-film distance, flange focal depth, flange back distance (FBD), flange focal length (FFL), or register, depending on the usage and source) of a lens mount system is {{the distance from the}} <b>mounting</b> <b>flange</b> (the metal ring on the camera and the rear of the lens) to the film plane. This value is different for different camera systems. The range of this distance which will render an image clearly in focus within all focal lengths is usually measured in hundredths of millimeters and is known as the depth of focus (not {{to be confused with the}} similarly named depth of field).|$|E
5000|$|Most of the time, low {{backlash}} case-hardened gears mounted in ball-or-taper-roller bearings are used. Depending {{on the size}} of the saw blades, a maximum of five gear sets with a gear reduction of up to 40:1 can be used. Variable speed motors of up to 150 KW drive the gearbox directly or via timing or [...] "V" [...] belts. Many saws have the blade <b>mounting</b> <b>flange</b> integrated within the spindle. This is less expensive, but requires expensive maintenance when the blade mounting surfaces wear. However, some more innovative saws have removable drive hubs which are mounted rigidly, and can be easily replaced. Some saws also use flywheels on the input shaft of the gearbox to smooth the fluctuating torque.|$|E
5000|$|A lug-style {{butterfly}} valve used in dead end service generally has a reduced pressure rating. For example, a lug-style {{butterfly valve}} <b>mounted</b> between two <b>flanges</b> has a [...] pressure rating. The same valve <b>mounted</b> with one <b>flange,</b> in dead end service, has a [...] rating. Lugged valves are extremely resistant to chemicals and solvents and can handle temperatures up to 200 °C, {{which makes it}} a versatile solution.|$|R
5000|$|The FT was Nippon Kogaku's first SLR with a {{built-in}} TTL light meter. As such, Nippon Kogaku {{could not find a}} way to automatically synchronize their Nikkor Auto lenses' aperture information with the FT body. Therefore, mounting lenses required a special preparatory procedure. First, the lens' maximum aperture (smallest f-stop number) must set against the film speed scale on the FT's shutter speed ring. Then, the [...] "meter coupling pin" [...] on the ring surrounding the FT's lens <b>mount</b> <b>flange</b> must pushed {{all the way to the}} right and the lens' aperture ring must be preset to f/5.6 to line up the [...] "meter coupling shoe" [...] with the pin for mounting. Note that the lens maximum aperture had to be reset every time the lens was changed. This was very inconvenient compared to some other SLRs of the 1960s.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{benefits}} of the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) was the opportunity to study the before and after effects of low earth orbit space environment on the spacecraft thermal control coatings. Since the LDEF's thermal control was totally passive by design, the selection of the external surface absorptivity to emissivity ratio (alpha/epsilon) and the ability for the coating to retain the alpha/epsilon over time was an important consideration in the thermal design of the LDEF. The primary surface coating chosen for the LDEF structure was clear chromic anodized aluminum with an average design alpha/epsilon of 0. 32 / 0. 16. External surface absorptivity (alpha) and emissivity (epsilon) were measured on all intercostals, longerons, tray <b>mounting</b> <b>flanges,</b> thermal control panels, and a limited number of experiment surface coatings after the experiment trays were removed from the LDEF structure. All surface alpha/epsilon measurements were made using portable hand held infrared and solar spectrum reflectometers. The absorptivity measurements were taken with a Devices and Services SSR-ER version 5. 0 solar spectra reflectometer which has a stated uncertainty of +/- 0. 01, and all normal emissivity measurements were made using the Gier Dunkle DB- 100 infrared reflectometer also with a stated uncertainty of +/- 0. 01. Both instruments were calibrated in the laboratory by LaRC instrumentation personnel before being used in the field at KSC. A combined total of 733 measurements were taken on the anodized aluminum hardware which included the structure (intercostals, longerons, and center ring), earth and space end thermal control panels, and experiment tray <b>mounting</b> <b>flanges.</b> The facility thermal control coatings measured in this survey cover 33 percent of the total exposed LDEF surface area. To correlate low earth orbit environmental effects on the anodized coatings, measurements were taken in both exposed and unexposed surfaces and compared to quality assurance (QA) measurements taken on the new surfaces at the time of hardware fabrication in 1978. The results of investigation are presented...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{the current}} design (now called [...] "Keystone") is first {{referenced}} in US Patent US 5624274 of Nov 7, 1995 for a [...] "Telephone connector with contact protection block" [...] - by International Connectors And Cable Corporation. In this design the module is affixed {{by a single}} diagonally inclined <b>mounting</b> <b>flange,</b> together with a protuberance (ramp) on the opposite side. In the patent description, it is stated that [...] "the jack assembly may be mounted to a face plate by first inserting {{the bottom of the}} jack assembly into a jack opening until the ramp of the housing engages a mounting surface of the face plate. The jack assembly is then rotated and snapped into place due to deflection of the cantilever latch of the housing." ...|$|E
5000|$|AI — Manual focus with [...] "Automatic Maximum-Aperture Indexing," [...] {{introduced}} in 1977. The AI standard adds a Meter Coupling Ridge to the aperture ring, which encodes the current aperture setting {{relative to the}} maximum, and a Lens Speed Indexing Post on the <b>mounting</b> <b>flange,</b> which encodes the maximum aperture itself. The Ridge and Post couple to the camera's light meter. Lenses designated AI-S, Series E, and AF all include these features of AI. Current professional Nikon camera bodies link with the Meter Coupling Ridge, but the Lens Speed Indexing Post is ignored and the maximum aperture value is set electronically by the operator instead. AI-designated lenses also improved on the original Meter Coupling Prong, adding cutaways which allow more ambient light to fall on the aperture ring, increasing visibility on cameras which optically projected the setting inside the viewfinder.|$|E
50|$|Weber carburetors {{are marked}} with a model code on the <b>mounting</b> <b>flange,</b> the body, or {{on the cover of}} the float-chamber. This begins with a number which {{originally}} indicated the diameter (in millimetres) of the throttle bore, but later lost this significance. If this number has a single pair of digits, both chokes are of the same diameter and operate together; if it has two pairs of digits separated by a stroke (e.g. 28/36), there are primary and secondary chokes that are opened one after the other, usually of differing diameter. These numbers are followed by a group of letters, which indicates various features: the DCOE is a sidedraught unit, all others being downdraught; the DCD has a piston-type starter valve as opposed to a strangler choke; and so on. After the letters there will be a further number, which may be followed by a letter, e.g. 4B, 13A; these indicate the series. The full designation might be 40 DCOE 29, 45 DCOE 9, etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{first series}} of Konica single-lens reflex cameras used the Konica F lens mount, {{named after the}} first camera to use it. This was a bayonet mount, and is not {{compatible}} with later Konica lens <b>mounts.</b> The <b>flange</b> focal distance of the F-mount was 40.5 mm, {{one of the smallest}} ever used for a 35 mm SLR. The diameter was 40 mm.|$|R
50|$|The main {{function}} of the cap is to enclose the pressure chamber at one end. The cap {{is connected to the}} body by means of welding, threading, bolts, or tie rod. Caps also perform as cylinder <b>mounting</b> components <b>flange,</b> cap trunnion, cap clevis. Cap size is determined based on the bending stress. A static seal / o-ring is used in between cap and barrel (except welded construction).|$|R
50|$|The MFT {{system design}} {{specifies}} a bayonet type lens <b>mount</b> with a <b>flange</b> focal distance of slightly under 20 mm. By avoiding internal mirrors, the MFT standard allows a much thinner camera body.|$|R
