5|$|By 1973, the {{government}} regarded Black Consciousness as a threat. It sought to disrupt Biko's activities, and in March 1973 placed a banning order on him. This {{prevented him from}} leaving the King William's Town magisterial district, prohibited him from speaking either in public or to <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> at a time, barred his membership of political organisations, and forbade the media from quoting him. As a result, he returned to Ginsberg, living initially in his mother's house and later in his own residence.|$|E
5|$|Bantu Stephen Biko was an anti-apartheid {{activist who}} was a {{founding}} member of the South African Students' Organisation in 1968 and the Black People's Convention in 1972. Through these groups, and through other activities, he promoted the ideas of the Black Consciousness movement, and became a prominent member of the resistance to apartheid in the 1970s. The government of South Africa placed a banning order on him in 1973, preventing him from leaving his hometown, meeting with <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>person,</b> publishing his writing, and speaking in public. In August 1977 Biko was arrested for breaking his banning order.|$|E

5|$|Fast {{transient}} response and low distortion are both characteristic of electrostatics. The driver, being only 0.00137-inch thick and weighing only 3mg, is thus capable of stopping and starting seemingly instantaneously with no damping {{necessary to the}} drive units. However, the design also limits bandwidth to between 40Hz and 10kHz. Kohli of TNT noted that upper register starts to taper above 10kHz and then falls off severely beyond 13kHz, and is 15-20dB down at 20kHz. The speaker's design makes them extremely directional, and the general practice is to toe in the speakers to point directly to the listener.

5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of a piece of furniture, indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his fingers in the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The ring {{signature}} is a {{group signature}} without a group manager, so that a signer realizes a signature {{in the name of}} the group. In some situations it is necessary for a message to be signed by <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>persons.</b> The scheme of the ring signature with divided key is an algorithm which ensures realizing a key signature by a group of k entities from a group of n entities. Because of the way this scheme is elaborated, each signer has his own private key, which he uses in the signing phase. Checking the key is realized by using a single common public key. The signature scheme is based on the problem of the discrete logarithm. This cryptographic primitive ensures the anonymity of the signature, which is a ring signature...|$|R

50|$|In the Book of Offices {{written by}} pseudo-Kodinos {{in the middle}} of the 14th century, the post {{occupies}} the 48th place in the imperial hierarchy, between the logothetēs tou stratiōtikou and the logothetēs tōn agelōn. The French scholar Rodolphe Guilland suggested that it was closely associated with the prōtokynēgos ("first huntsman"), who was in the 41st place, and that holders of the former office were promoted to the latter. According to pseudo-Kodinos, his functions were to supervise the keepers of the falcons. As a sign of this he bore a left-hand gauntlet on his belt, decorated with gold braid and purple eagles. His uniform was otherwise typical of the mid-level courtiers: a gold-brocaded hat (skiadion), a plain silk kabbadion, and a skaranikon (domed hat) covered in golden and lemon-yellow silk and decorated with gold wire and images of the emperor in front and rear, respectively depicted enthroned and on horseback. The office could be held by <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>persons</b> at the same time.|$|R

5000|$|This {{phrase is}} recited by Muslims in many {{different}} situations. For example, when they are very happy, during times of extreme stress, to express approval, to praise a speaker, or as a battle cry (contemporarily used by Pakistan Army). In the Islamic world, instead of applause, often someone will shout Takbir or Nara-e-Takbir (in Urdu or Persian) and the crowd will respond with Allahu Akbar (God is great). The word is also used in Muslim prayers. The Government of Pakistan asked for proposals from the nation to decide a name by which the day should be celebrated. A country wide campaign was launched to select the name for this particular day. Thousands of names were propose by millions of Pakistanis. This name was suggested by <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>persons.</b> All persons who suggested this name were given away Prime Minister Award. Youm-e-Takbir here can be translated to [...] "The day of greatness" [...] or [...] "The day of God's greatness".|$|R
40|$|Logical {{inference}} is {{an engine}} for human thinking, especially, for {{decision making in}} an interdependent situation with <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>persons.</b> We study the possibility of predic-tion/decision making in a finite 2 —person game with pure strategies, following the Nash-Johansen noncooperative solution theory. Since some infinite regress naturally arises in this theory, we adopt a fixed-point extension IR 2 of the epistemic logic KD 2, which is still a finitary propositional logic. The base logic KD 2 is adopted to capture individual decision making {{from the viewpoint of}} logical inference. Our results differ between a game with the interchangeable set of Nash equilibria and a game with the uninterchangeable set. For the former, we have decidability, i. e., player can decide whether each of his strategies is a final decision or not. For the latter, he can neither decide it to be a possible decision nor can disprove it. This takes the form of Gödel’s incompleteness theorem, while it is much sim-pler. Our undecidability also is related to the self-referential structure, but its main source is interdependence of payoffs and independent prediction/decision making...|$|R
50|$|The second {{defensive}} {{behavior is}} control, {{which is when}} <b>one</b> <b>person</b> is forcing a solution upon the other person. This means that the speaker is making a decision that affects both the speaker and the listener without considering what the listener wants or needs. The supportive behavior that contrasts control is problem orientation. This is when a person looks for a solution that will satisfy both people. Finding a solution that will please both people is <b>more</b> important <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> winning and the other person losing.|$|R

25|$|In many jurisdictions where {{same-sex}} couples can access civil unions or registered partnerships, these are often intended as parallel institutions {{to that of}} heterosexual monogamous marriage. Accordingly, they include parallel entitlements, obligations, and limitations. Among the latter, {{as in the case}} of the New Zealand Civil Union Act 2005, there are parallel prohibitions on civil unions with more than one partner, which is considered bigamy, or dual marriage/civil union hybrids with <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>person.</b> Both are banned under Sections 205–206 of the Crimes Act 1961. In jurisdictions where same-sex marriage proper exists, bigamous same-sex marriages fall under the same set of legal prohibitions as bigamous heterosexual marriages. As yet, there is no case law applicable to these issues.|$|E

50|$|To {{explain how}} changes in this {{behavior}} {{ultimately led to}} multiple epidemics of STDs among gay men in the 70s, he describes the dynamics of STD epidemics.

Rotello describes the three factors that govern this process, the so-called Triad of Risk: the interaction of Prevalence, Infectivity, and Contact Rate.|$|R

25|$|The {{number of}} copies distributed, either on an average day or on {{particular}} days (typically Sunday), is called the newspaper's circulation {{and is one of}} the principal factors used to set advertising rates. Circulation is not necessarily the same as copies sold, since some copies or newspapers are distributed without cost. Readership figures may be higher than circulation figures because many copies are read by <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>person,</b> although this is offset by the {{number of copies}} distributed but not read (especially for those distributed free). In the United States, the Alliance for Audited Media maintains historical and current data on average circulation of daily and weekly newspapers and other periodicals.|$|E
25|$|Since tattoo {{instruments}} come {{in contact}} with blood and bodily fluids, diseases may be transmitted if the instruments are used on <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> without being sterilised. However, infection from tattooing in clean and modern tattoo studios employing single-use needles is rare. With amateur tattoos, such as those applied in prisons, however, there is an elevated risk of infection. To address this problem, a programme was introduced in Canada as of the summer of 2005 that provides legal tattooing in prisons, both to reduce health risks and to provide inmates with a marketable skill. Inmates were to be trained to staff and operate the tattoo parlours once six of them opened successfully.|$|E
25|$|Most virtual {{airlines}} {{have a specific}} ranking system for their pilots, that tend to involve restricting which airplanes the member is allowed to fly. Pilots complete flights for their airline, using their simulator, either online (using a network such as VATSIM) or offline, and then file a pilot report. A key aspect of these pilot reports is logging {{the number of hours}} flown, which directly affects the members promotion to other ranks. Ranking systems used typically use terminology associated with commercial aviation, such as designating senior pilots as captain. Commercial aircraft have flight crew consisting of several people, whereas in flight simulation it is rare for individual aircraft to have <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> piloting it, therefore rank distinctions are focused on the members efforts within the organization rather than their seniority on board an individual aircraft.|$|E
