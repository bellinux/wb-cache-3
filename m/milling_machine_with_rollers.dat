40|$|Purpose: The {{burnishing}} is chip less machining {{which can}} be used to improve the surface roughness and surface hardness on any metal work piece. The purpose of the research was to demonstrate the multi roller burnishing process on non ferrous metals namely Aluminum, Brass and Copper to improve surface roughness and surface hardness. Design/methodology/approach: The experiments were carried on non-ferrous metals in a vertical <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> <b>with</b> various spindle rotations, feed rate and depth of penetration. Findings: The surface roughness on various no-ferrous metals improved by high spindle rotations with high feed rate and depth of penetration. Research limitations/implications: Due to high spindle rotations <b>with</b> multi <b>roller</b> in action, the vibration of the equipment could not be controlled. Some mechanisms have to be devised to reduce the vibrations. However, it is not in the scope of this research. Practical implications: The experiments were conducted with out coolant and this is added advantages for the environment and pollution free. Originality/value: The burnishing process can be carried in a lathe and vertical/ horizontal <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> <b>with</b> suitable fixtures to hold the work piece. The research can be continued on hard metals with varying hardness to find the surface roughness improvement. It is an eye opening for researchers to continue...|$|R

50|$|Milling can be {{done with}} a wide range of machine tools. The {{original}} class of <b>machine</b> tools for <b>milling</b> was the <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> (often called a mill). After the advent of computer numerical control (CNC), <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> evolved into <b>machining</b> centers (<b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> <b>with</b> automatic tool changers, tool magazines or carousels, CNC control, coolant systems, and enclosures), generally classified as vertical machining centers (VMCs) and horizontal machining centers (HMCs). The integration of milling into turning environments and of turning into milling environments, begun with live tooling for lathes and the occasional use of mills for turning operations, led to a new class of machine tools, multitasking machines (MTMs), which are purpose-built to provide for a default machining strategy of using any combination of milling and turning within the same work envelope.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is {{solid-state}} {{process for}} joining materials by using frictional heat generated due to rotating tool along the weld line. Since its invention about two decades ago, wide spread use of FSW is still restricted due to very expensive purpose built FSW machines {{available in the}} market. As an alternative, a <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> {{can be used to}} carry out the FSW depending on the capabilities of the machine. In cases where <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> have a fixed head, limitation of zero degree tool tilt angle results in substantial defects (e. g. tunnel defect) in weldments. The objective {{of this study is to}} design and fabricate an adjustable-angle fixture to incorporate tool tilting in a CNC <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> <b>with</b> fixed spindle head. The testing of the fabricated fixture is then carried out by running the FSW experiments at different tilt angles. ...|$|R

This system is dedicated to vocational training courses on using and programming numerically-controlled <b>milling</b> <b>machines.</b> It aims at replacing the conventional mechanical <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> which are currently used in such vocational training courses. VTT proposes an interactive manipulation of a cutter of a virtual <b>milling</b> <b>machine,</b> <b>with</b> visual, audio and haptic (force) feedback. VTT uses a haptic device which was specifically designed {{for the purpose of}} our pedagogical application. When the virtual cutter mills a piece of material, a plastic deformation algorithm is used and the material is progressively carved. Trainees can feel the cutting effort thanks to a force feedback which varies as a function of different simulation parameters (rotation speed of the tool, type of material to carve, etc). Realistic audio feedback (which was recorded in real situations) and additional visual assistances may be added, in order to increase the perception and understanding of the milling task. A preliminary evaluation of VTT showed that this simulator could be used by vocational trainers successfully.
