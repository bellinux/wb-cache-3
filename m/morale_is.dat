5|$|In land engagements, {{players have}} an 18th-century army {{consisting}} of units such as cavalry, musketeers, riflemen and artillery. Each {{has its own}} intrinsic advantages, disadvantages, cost, and overall effectiveness. Players must use 18th-century tactics and formations to defeat their enemies. The battlefield terrain and the weather are also important. Factions can lay siege to settlements, replacing open land battles with street fighting and close-quarter combat. Each unit has morale, which increases if the battle goes well, or decrease after heavy casualties, army losses, coming under artillery bombardment, or {{with the death of}} the general. Tactical situations such as attacking from a flank or the rear, or depriving a unit of allied reinforcements, also hit morale. When a unit's <b>morale</b> <b>is</b> sufficiently depleted, it will be routed and flee the battlefield. Depending on whether <b>morale</b> <b>is</b> merely broken or entirely shattered, the player may be able to rally the unit and regroup. Victory is achieved by causing every enemy unit to rout, or be annihilated. In addition, sieges can be won if the attacker manages {{to take control of the}} settlement's central square for a set amount of time. Empire: Total War also introduces several new battlefield elements to the Total War series. Units can take cover behind walls or in buildings, allowing increased interactivity with the terrain and making some buildings points of tactical importance. Field defences may be constructed on the battlefield. Infantry units can also scale small obstacles such as walls and fences. Each unit has different capabilities such as Square Formation, Wedge, Diamond, Equip bayonets, or Fire at will.|$|E
5|$|The morale {{system in}} the game is similar to {{previous}} Dynasty Warrior games. <b>Morale</b> <b>is</b> increased and decreased by performing a number of positive actions for the player’s army. Action that produce this effect include defeating enemies in multiples of fifty, defeating enemy officers, and completing special events such as ambushes, siege attacks, and finding enemy strongholds. Morale in the game has a strong effect on the player's forces, determining their strength and speed, {{as well as their}} ability to perform Berwald attacks. Morale will also affect how the CPU characters move along through battle. Example: Ally Oxenstiernas are winning.|$|E
5|$|In naval battles, players {{control a}} fleet of up to twenty varied ships, and use 18th-century tactics to {{overcome}} enemy fleets. As with army units, each ship's crew has a set amount of morale that changes as a battle progresses; a crew may attempt to withdraw their vessel from the battle if their <b>morale</b> <b>is</b> broken, or in extreme cases may surrender. A battle is won when all hostile ships have been sunk, captured, or have left the map. Individual ships can be maneuvered, or remain in formation with other ships from the fleet. Players can designate which parts of a hostile ship they want a crew to target, making ships prone to sustaining authentic damage during a battle: masts can be toppled, sails and gun ports can be destroyed and damage can entirely disable a ship's ability to manoeuvre or eventually sink it. The types of ammunition can be used during a battle are grapeshot, chain-shot and round shot, which have different uses, from killing enemy crew to disabling enemy movement. As battles progress, crews can try to board enemy vessels and fight hand-to-hand {{in an attempt to}} capture the ship. The weather in a naval battle is also important; bad weather can create poor visibility. Ships cannot be repaired in mid-battle unlike its successor, , but fires on board ships can be put out automatically.|$|E

25|$|In {{military}} studies it {{has been}} found that resilience is also dependent on group support: unit cohesion and <b>morale</b> <b>is</b> the best predictor of combat resiliency within a unit or organization. Resilience is highly correlated to peer support and group cohesion. Units with high cohesion tend to experience a lower rate of psychological breakdowns than units with low cohesion and morale. High cohesion and morale enhance adaptive stress reactions.|$|E
25|$|The Ghosts {{are sent}} to join the 81st/1st Recon – the merged 81st Belladon and the Tanith First, led by Colonel Lucian Wilder. The {{regiment}} is {{taking part in the}} campaign to capture the ancient step-city Sparshad Mons, occupied by the Blood Pact and disturbingly warped nocturnal predators. The situation in the Mons is grim; desertion is high, <b>morale</b> <b>is</b> low, and most of the Imperial soldiers are inexperienced grunts. Gaunt is deployed to another section of the step-city and attached to a regiment from Fortis Binary, accompanied by Ludd and Eszrah Night. The situation deteriorates rapidly as the Blood Pact launch a counter-assault against the Imperial forces.|$|E
25|$|For {{successful}} operations, surprise must {{be achieved}} by the guerrillas. If the operation has been betrayed or compromised it is usually called off immediately. Intelligence is also extremely important, and detailed knowledge of the target's dispositions, weaponry and <b>morale</b> <b>is</b> gathered before any attack. Intelligence can be harvested in several ways. Collaborators and sympathizers will usually provide {{a steady flow of}} useful information. If working clandestinely, the guerrilla operative may disguise his membership in the insurgent operation, and use deception to ferret out needed data. Employment or enrollment as a student may be undertaken near the target zone, community organizations may be infiltrated, and even romantic relationships struck up as part of intelligence gathering.|$|E

25|$|Sun Shangxiang has {{infiltrated}} Cao Cao's {{camp and}} is secretly noting its details and sending them via a pigeon to Zhuge Liang. Meanwhile, Cao Cao's army is seized with a plague of typhoid fever that kills {{a number of}} his troops. Cao Cao orders the corpses to be sent on floating rafts to the allies' camp, in the hope of spreading the plague to his enemies. The allied army's <b>morale</b> <b>is</b> affected when some unsuspecting soldiers let the plague in. Eventually, a disheartened Liu Bei leaves with his forces while Zhuge Liang stays behind to assist Sun Quan. Cao Cao is overjoyed when he hears that the alliance has collapsed. At the same time, Cai Mao and Zhang Yun propose a new tactic of interlocking the battleships with iron beams to minimise rocking when sailing on the river and reduce the chances of the troops falling seasick.|$|E
500|$|Napoleon's {{seemingly}} dismissive remark {{may have}} been strategic, given his maxim [...] "in war, <b>morale</b> <b>is</b> everything". He had acted similarly in the past, and {{on the morning of}} the battle of Waterloo {{may have been}} responding to the pessimism and objections of his chief of staff and senior generals.|$|E
500|$|The {{battle was}} seen as a great boost of morale for the British as two days previous, they had lost the cruiser [...] to a U-boat.

500|$|In December 1945, he was {{assigned}} to headquarters of the Atlantic Division of Air Transport Command at Fort Totten, New York, and the following month was appointed commanding general of the Newfoundland Base command at Fort Pepperell, Newfoundland. There, he oversaw operations of American stations in Greenland, northern Quebec, Baffin Island and Labrador. Haynes told a National Geographic reporter that, even though the air stations were remote, [...] "our troops' <b>morale</b> <b>is</b> high".|$|E
500|$|Marseille's {{impact on}} Allied fighter pilots and their <b>morale</b> <b>is</b> unclear. Andrew Thomas quoted Pilot Officer Bert Houle of No. 213 Squadron RAF; [...] "He was an {{extremely}} skilled pilot and a deadly shot. It was a helpless feeling to be continually bounced, {{and to do so}} little about it." [...] Robert Tate, on the other hand, is skeptical Allied pilots would have been familiar, asking, [...] "How well was Marseille known to DAF personnel in the Desert? Apparently not so well. Although there is little indication that some Allied pilots may have heard of Marseille, this information did not readily make its way down to Allied Squadrons. Fanciful stories abound of how pilots knew of one another and hoped to duel with each other in the skies. This was more than likely not the case." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Towards {{the end of}} last season, where I {{said the}} best is yet to come, I {{strongly}} felt that way because towards {{the end of last}} season we closed out the season strong. I knew that was a catalyst to really turn up the team, to get a little bit more out of everyone. Denny goes down with his knee injury. He comes back, obviously not 100 percent. The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward. It's easier when the <b>morale</b> <b>is</b> high to get a little bit more out of your guys. Our benchmark is ourselves and we're just trying to work on that." ...|$|E

2500|$|If a {{ship has}} surrendered, or its captain is {{defeated}} in combat, {{it is considered}} [...] "captured." [...] The player may now unload any gold and cargo from the ship, and may also add it to his fleet if there is room. If the ship's crew had a specialist, like a sailmaker or a cooper, these will be added automatically to the player's crew. Some of the captured ship's crew may also be inclined to join the player's ranks, especially if the player's crew <b>morale</b> <b>is</b> high. Captured enemy crews also may have news on various events {{of interest to the}} player.|$|E
2500|$|The Fu Zi {{recorded}} {{another piece}} of advice Guo Jia gave to Cao Cao during the Battle of Xiapi: [...] "In the past, Xiang Yu never lost any of the over 70 battles he fought in, but once the tide turned against him, he ended up in death and destruction. This was due to his reliance on his personal courage and his negligence towards strategy. Lü Bu has lost three consecutive battles and his army's <b>morale</b> <b>is</b> low and his defences are weakening. His might is not comparable to Xiang Yu, {{and he is now}} overwhelmed by defeat and weariness. If we take advantage of our successes to press on the attack on him, we can defeat him." [...] Cao Cao agreed with him.|$|E
2500|$|The {{officers}} {{suggested to}} pile up earth to form small hills and replenish their equipment. However, Lü Meng disagreed, [...] "It'll take several days to build the hills and replenish our equipment. By then, the enemy would have reinforced their defences and their relief forces would have arrived, and we can't defeat them. The rainwater has flowed in, and the water level will subside if we linger on for days. By then, it'll {{be very difficult for}} our ships to retreat and we may be in danger. As of now, I observe that the fortress's defences are weak, so we can achieve victory if we attack it from all directions when our army's <b>morale</b> <b>is</b> still high. We can retreat via the water route after that. That's the way to secure total victory." [...] Sun Quan heeded Lü Meng's suggestion.|$|E

2500|$|During the Battle of Xiapi, Cao Cao {{defeated}} Lü Bu in {{the initial}} stages and forced him to retreat back to Xiapi Commandery (下邳郡; south of present-day Pizhou, Jiangsu). Cao Cao then laid siege to Xiapi and launched several attacks but was unable to breach the city walls. As his troops grew weary, Cao Cao considered withdrawing. However, Xun You and Guo Jia advised him, [...] "Lü Bu is brave but foolhardy. His forces' <b>morale</b> <b>is</b> very low after suffering consecutive defeats. An army's morale depends on its commander's will to fight on. Chen Gong is intelligent but slow. Since Lü Bu's army's morale hasn't recovered yet and Chen Gong hasn't finalised his plans yet, you can eventually defeat Lü Bu if you continue attacking him." [...] Cao Cao then ordered his troops to dig ditches and redirect the waters of the Yi and Si rivers to flood Xiapi. Xiapi fell quickly and Lü Bu was captured alive and executed.|$|E
2500|$|Chinese troops used tàigǔ drums {{to motivate}} troops, to help set a marching pace, and {{to call out}} orders or announcements. For example, during a war between Qi and Lu in 684 BC, the effect of drum on soldier's <b>morale</b> <b>is</b> {{employed}} to change {{the result of a}} major battle. Fife-and-drum corps of Swiss mercenary foot soldiers also used drums. They used an early version of the snare drum carried over the player's right shoulder, suspended by a strap (typically played with one hand using traditional grip). It is to this instrument that the English word [...] "drum" [...] was first used. Similarly, during the English Civil War rope-tension drums would be carried by junior officers as a means to relay commands from senior officers over the noise of battle. These were also hung over the shoulder of the drummer and typically played with two drum sticks. Different regiments and companies would have distinctive and unique drum beats only they recognized. In the mid-19th century, the Scottish military started incorporating pipe bands into their Highland Regiments.|$|E
2500|$|In 198, Cao Cao {{launched}} a campaign against his rival Lü Bu in Xu Province, leading to the Battle of Xiapi. Lü Bu lost three battles and retreated to Xiapi (下邳; present-day Pizhou, Jiangsu). Cao Cao's forces besieged the city for months but they still could not conquer it because Lü Bu and his men resisted firmly. By then, Cao Cao's troops were tired and weary of battle, so Cao intended to withdraw his forces. However, Guo Jia and Xun You told Cao Cao, [...] "Lü Bu is courageous but foolhardy. His army's <b>morale</b> <b>is</b> low because he has already lost three battles. The troops look up to their commander. If their commander shows any sign of weakness, the men will lose their fighting spirit. Lü Bu may have Chen Gong as an intelligent adviser but the latter's strategies always come late. Now, we should {{take advantage of this}} situation, when the morale of Lü Bu's forces is low and when Chen Gong has yet to think of a solution, to press on a fierce attack and we'll achieve victory." [...] Cao Cao heeded their advice and directed the waters of the Yi (沂) and Si rivers to flood Xiapi, resulting in his triumph over Lü Bu.|$|E
5000|$|John Morales {{also served}} as underboss to future Bonanno boss Frank Labruzzo {{for a brief period}} and later was [...] "acting boss".
