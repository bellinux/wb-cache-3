2500|$|The {{earliest}} disc records (1889–1894) {{were made}} of various materials including hard rubber. Around 1895, a shellac-based compound was introduced and became standard. Exact formulas for this compound varied by manufacturer and {{over the course of}} time, but it was typically composed of about one-third shellac and about two-thirds mineral filler, which meant finely pulverized rock, usually slate and limestone, with an admixture of cotton fibers to add tensile strength, carbon black for color (without this, it tended to be a [...] "dirty" [...] gray or brown color that most record companies considered unattractive), and a very small amount of a lubricant to facilitate <b>mold</b> <b>release</b> during manufacture. Some makers, notably Columbia Records, used a laminated construction with a core disc of coarser material or fiber. The production of shellac records continued {{until the end of the}} 78rpm format (i.e., the late 1950s in most developed countries, but well into the 1960s in some other places), but increasingly less abrasive formulations were used during its declining years and very late examples in truly like-new condition can have as low noise levels as vinyl.|$|E

5000|$|Carnauba wax {{may be used}} as a <b>mold</b> <b>release</b> {{agent for}} {{manufacture}} of fibre-reinforced plastics. An aerosol <b>mold</b> <b>release</b> agent is formed by dissolving carnauba wax in a solvent. Unlike silicone or PTFE, carnauba is suitable for use with liquid epoxy, epoxy molding compounds (EMC), and some other plastic types and generally enhances their properties [...] Carnauba wax is not very soluble in chlorinated or aromatic hydrocarbons.Carnauba is used in melt/castable explosives to produce an insensitive explosive formula such as Composition B, which is a blend of RDX and TNT.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of release agents used in the molding of rubber products. Both are {{silicone}} based. The decision on which to use has to do with lubricity and release. Water-diluted silicon is used when you have rubber sliding over a hot mold (sheets or slugs). The silicon keeps the rubber from sticking to the mold but just as important it lubricates the rubber so it will slide over the hot mold as it is loaded. Diluted silicon typically has to be applied every cycle. Semi-permanent <b>mold</b> <b>release</b> builds a silicon matrix on the mold that becomes a barrier between the rubber and the metal surface of the mold. The matrix is created by the other ingredients in the semi-permanent <b>mold</b> <b>release.</b> Applications of semi-permanent <b>mold</b> <b>release</b> vary from every cycle to once daily applications depending on the compound being molded and the design and quality of the mold. Silicone-based rubber products, however, require a non-silicone based releasing agent.|$|E

50|$|Palmitic acid is used {{to produce}} soaps, cosmetics, and {{industrial}} <b>mold</b> <b>release</b> agents. These applications use sodium palmitate, which is commonly obtained by saponification of palm oil. To this end, palm oil, rendered from palm tree (species Elaeis guineensis), is treated with sodium hydroxide (in the form of caustic soda or lye), which causes hydrolysis of the ester groups, yielding glycerol and sodium palmitate.|$|E

40|$|In the {{research}} {{featured in this}} PhD thesis, the fundamental aspects of Phase Separation MicroFabrication (PSµF) were studied. PSµF is a technique through which polymeric porous films with defined structures on their surfaces can be created. This is achieved by phase separation of polymer solutions that are in contact with microstructured molds. Diverse topics were covered, including the study of shrinkage during phase separation {{and its effect on}} feature replication, gas entrapment during casting of polymer solutions on <b>molds,</b> <b>release</b> of films perforated by pillars on molds (microsieves) and the development of permeable molds to yield membranes with structures on both sides.

TOC can come from the feed water used to produce UPW, from the components used to convey the UPW (additives in the manufacturing piping products or extrusion aides and <b>mold</b> <b>release</b> agents), from subsequent manufacturing and cleaning operations of piping systems or from dirty pipes, fittings and valves.|$|E
5000|$|Zinc {{stearate}} is a [...] "zinc soap" [...] that {{is widely}} used industrially. In this context, soap is used in its formal sense, a metal [...] "salt" [...] of a fatty acid. It is a white solid that repels water. It is insoluble in polar solvents such as alcohol and ether but soluble in aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene) and chlorinated hydrocarbons when heated. It {{is the most powerful}} <b>mold</b> <b>release</b> agent among all metal soaps. It contains no electrolyte and has a hydrophobic effect. Its main application areas are the plastics and rubber industry, where it is used as a releasing agent and lubricant which can be easily incorporated.|$|E
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{continually}} {{stressed that the}} two most critical material parameters {{for the success of}} the rotary furnace are the hearth plate and the <b>molding</b> <b>release</b> powder. Both of these issues have been solidly addressed in this quarter. They have tested the three best candidates for hearth plate material this quarter. Although they had to use the in-house gas furnaces for the testing, one of the materials combines the best heating efficiency with the least sticking tendency. This material will be used for the electric prototype. The <b>molding</b> <b>release</b> powder is mainly used for preventing the glass from adhering to the hearth plate while the glass is softening for pressing. They recently visited several companies in Japan who also repress glass. The release agent that they use is Boron Nitride. They have identified a supplier within New York state, but their concern is the very high price of this material. They are bringing in samples of different grades for experimentation, but the focus continues to be to eliminate the need for any powder. An additional area for material testing was addressed during this quarter. Once the glass is in the tool (mold) for pressing, the glass has the potential to adhere to the metal that the tool and die are made from (usually steel). Both the powder and a spraying of a carbon product are currently used to reduce this problem. Alternate materials for the tooling and/or surface coatings of the steel need to be identified and tested. During this quarter, they conducted some off-site test runs on two candidate coating materials: platinum and titanium...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{deposited}} Cr 2 O 3 /CrN duplex coatings, {{consisting of}} a thin Cr 2 O 3 oxide film {{on top of a}} CrN layer, with an unbalanced magnet ron (UBM) sputtering technique. Microstructure characterization was conducted with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Tribological evaluations were also performed with a scratch tester and ball-on-disc tribometer. Experimental results showed a well-adherent Cr 2 O 3 /CrN duplex coating morphology. The Cr 2 O 3 top-layer possesses an amorphous lattice structure. Gas flow rates and bias voltages had an impact upon mechanical and chemical properties of the Cr 3 O 3 /CrN coatings. To compensate the fluctuation of pumping efficiency, target poisoning and sputtering parameters, the flow rate of the reactive gas was rapidly and accurately regulated via a set of piezo valves and an optical emission monitor (OEM). OEM readings revealed the exact proportions of reactive gas consumed by metal plasma (US Patent 4 525 (1985) 417 Appl. Phys. Lett. 50 (1987) 1056; Surf. Coat. Technol. 49 (1991) 543). Gas flow rates were thus controlled, dynamically, with variations of processing conditions. At an OEM setting of 30 - 50 % and a pulsed bias voltage of - 55 V, the Cr 2 O 3 /CrN duplex coating demonstrated excellent micro-hardness (2533 Hv(25) g) and adhesion strength (L-c = 75 N). The highest contact angle between water and Cr 2 O 3 was measured at 103 degrees at an OEM setting of 30 %. An improved <b>mold</b> <b>releasing</b> capability is anticipated, especially compared with the traditional hard chrome plating. Finally, an outstanding wear Life of 4250 m was achieved on the Cr 2 O 3 /CrN duplex coating deposited at 50 % of OEM setting. In summary, the enhanced properties of micro-hardness, film adhesion, <b>mold</b> <b>releasing</b> and wear life of the Cr 2 O 3 /CrN duplex coating demonstrated its potential for injection molding applications.
