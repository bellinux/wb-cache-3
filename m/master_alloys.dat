For this reasons these composites {{are widely used}} in aerospace and automobile industries. In this work Scrap piston alloy was used as <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> because it contains silicon and magnesium. Silicon increases the casting ability and magnesium increases the wettability of alumina particles in <b>master</b> <b>alloy.</b> The desired composites were produced by the stir casting method by adding 5 %, 10 % and 15 % alumina particles in <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> respectively. For each of the composite alumina particles were preheated to a temperature of 800 °C for 2 hours. Then particles were added gradually into the molten <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> for achieving improved wettability and uniform distribution. The stirring was continued for 5 minutes. Finally composites ware poured into permanent metallic moulds at a temperature of 650 °C. The hardness and tensile strength of the composites were examined.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the metallic powder surface {{play a critical role}} in the development of strong bonds between particles during sintering, especially when introducing elements with a high affinity for oxygen. In this study, Mn and Si have been combined in a Fe–Mn–Si–C <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> powder in order to reduce their chemical activity and prevent oxidation during the heating stage of the sintering process. However, when this <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> powder is mixed with an iron base powder, differences in chemical activity between both components can lead to an oxygen transfer from the iron base powder to the surface of the <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> particles. The present research is focused on studying the evolution of the <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> particle surface during the early stages of sintering. Surface characterization by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> powder surface is mostly covered by a thin easily reducible iron oxide layer (~ 1 nm). Mn–Si particulate oxides are found as inclusions in specific areas of the surface.

40|$|The {{microstructure}} and phase {{composition of}} Al- 5 Ti- 1 B, Al- 4 Ti- 1 C and Al- 5 Ti- 0. 8 B- 0. 2 C <b>master</b> <b>alloys</b> were investigated by field emission {{scanning electron microscopy}} (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), {{and the effects of}} the three kinds of <b>master</b> <b>alloys</b> on the grain size and mechanical properties of 7050 alloy were investigated. The results show that the existence of Zr reduces the grain refining effects of Al- 5 Ti- 1 B and Al- 4 Ti- 1 C <b>master</b> <b>alloys,</b> but hardly influences the refinement of Al- 5 Ti- 0. 8 B- 0. 2 C master alloy. The reason is that Al- 5 Ti- 0. 8 B- 0. 2 C containing B-doped TiC can resist Zr-poisoning, and after adding 0. 2 % (mass fraction) Al- 5 Ti- 0. 8 B- 0. 2 C, the average grain size of 7050 alloy is reduced from about 200 μ m to (60 &# 177; 5) μ m, the ultimate tensile strength increases from 405 MPa to 515 MPa, increasing by 27. 2 %, and the elongation rate increases from 2. 1 % to 4. 1 %. However, after adding 0. 2 % Al- 5 Ti- 1 B and Al- 4 Ti- 1 C <b>master</b> <b>alloys,</b> the grain size is larger and the distribution is uneven, exhibiting obvious “refinement poisoning” phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Reaching {{high density}} in PM steels is {{important}} for high-performance applications. In this study, liquid phase sintering of PM steels by adding gas-atomized Ni-Mn-B <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> was investigated for enhancing the density levels of Fe- and Mo- prealloyed steel powder compacts. The results indicated that liquid formation occurs in two stages, beginning with the <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> melting (LP- 1) below and eutectic phase formation (LP- 2) above 1373 K (1100 °C). Mo and C addition revealed a significant influence on the LP- 2 temperatures and hence on the final densification behavior and mechanical properties. Microstructural embrittlement occurs {{with the formation of}} continuous boride networks along the grain boundaries, and its severity increases with carbon addition, especially for 2. 5 wt pct of <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> content. Sintering behavior, along with liquid generation, microstructural characteristics, and mechanical testing revealed that the reduced <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> content from 2. 5 to 1. 5 wt pct (reaching overall boron content from 0. 2 to 0. 12 wt pct) was necessary for obtaining good ductility with better mechanical properties. Sintering with Ni-Mn-B <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> enables the sintering activation by liquid phase formation in two stages to attain high density in PM steels suitable for high-performance applications...|$|R

The addition of the 96 Al– 2 Nb– 2 B <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> to the LM 25 alloy permits to significantly refine its microstructural features and the refinement is achieved in a great range of cooling rates.

40|$|Al– 5 Ti–C <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> was {{prepared}} {{and used to}} modify hypereutectic Al– 20 %Si alloy. The microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of hypereutectic Al– 20 %Si alloy with Al– 5 Ti–C <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> additions (0, 0. 4, 0. 6, 1. 0, 1. 6 and 2. 0 wt%) were investigated. The results show that, Al– 5 Ti–C <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> (0. 6 wt%, 10 min) can significantly refine both eutectic and primary Si of hypereutectic Al– 20 %Si alloy. The morphology of the primary Si crystals was significantly refined from a coarse polygonal and star-like shape to a fine polyhedral shape and the grain size of the primary Si was refined from roughly 90 – 120 μm to 20 – 50 μm. The eutectic Si phases were modified from a coarse platelet-like/needle-like structure to a fine fibrous structure with discrete particles. The Al– 5 Ti–C <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> (0. 6 wt%, 30 min) still has a good refinement effect. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS), elongation (El) and Brinell hardness (HB) of Al– 20 %Si alloy modified by the Al– 5 Ti–C <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> (0. 6 wt%, 10 min) increased by roughly 65 %, 70 % and 51 %, respectively, due to decreasing the size and changing the morphology on the primary and eutectic Si crystals. The change in mechanical properties corresponds to evolution of the microstructure...|$|R
