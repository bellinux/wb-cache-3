5000|$|Professor J.S. Ibsen (voiced by William Sanderson) - A {{mechanical}} genius, Professor J.S. Ibsen is Jumanji's resident mad scientist, {{referring to}} himself as a [...] "Master Builder". In reality, he is an android. Tasked to {{work on behalf of}} Jumanji, Ibsen operates from a large Industrial Era factory where he designs dangerous Steampunk-style machines and vehicles, creating game perils and nightmarish mechanoid obstacles such as battle-armored rhinos, acid-tongued frogs, and biting [...] "berbalangs". Regarding his machinations, he'll transmits nightly vocal reports to Jumanji itself, broadcasting throughout the jungle. In [...] "The Ultimate Weapon," [...] Ibsen was present at J.H. Slick's auctioning of the Transvector of Jumanji (a 'MacGuffin' which is similar to a Lemarchand's box). However, he elected to steal the device rather than outright bid for it, intending to destroy the Transvector on account of its potential threat to the entire world of Jumanji. In [...] "Robo-Peter", Ibsen initiated a <b>master</b> <b>scheme</b> to replace all young people in the 'real world' with androids, trapping the humans in the game world. However, Alan, Peter and Judy thwart this, resulting in the professor's factory being destroyed. Interestingly, J.S. Ibsen's first and middle name initials are a reference to William Sanderson's renowned character J.F. Sebastian from the 1982 Ridley Scott film Blade Runner. Also, Ibsen's surname is a reference to Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen and his 1893 stage play The Master Builder, the title being re-used for the title of Professor Ibsen's debut episode [...] "Master Builder".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experience gained {{related to the}} development of an integrated simulation model of water policy. Within this context, we analyze particular difficulties raised by the inclusion of multi-level governance that assigns the responsibility of individual or collective decision-making to a variety of actors, regarding measures of which the implementation has significant effects toward the sustainability of socio-hydrosystems. Multi-level governance procedures are compared with the potential of model-based impact assessment. Our discussion is illustrated {{on the basis of the}} exploitation of the multi-agent platform {MAELIA} dedicated to the simulation of social, economic and environmental impacts of low-water management in a context of climate and regulatory changes. We focus on three major decision-making processes occurring in the Adour-Garonne basin, France: (i) the participatory development of the <b>Master</b> <b>Scheme</b> for Water Planning and Management (SDAGE) under the auspices of the Water Agency; (ii) the publication of water use restrictions in situations of water scarcity; and (iii) the determination of the abstraction volumes for irrigation and their allocation. The {MAELIA} platform explicitly takes into account the mode of decision-making when it is framed by a procedure set beforehand, focusing on the actors' participation and on the nature and parameters of the measures to be implemented. It is observed that in some water organizations decision-making follows patterns that can be represented as rule-based actions triggered by thresholds of resource states. When decisions are resulting from individual choice, endowing virtual agents with bounded rationality allows us to reproduce (in silico) their behavior and decisions in a reliable way. However, the negotiation processes taking place during the period of time simulated by the models in arenas of collective choices are not all reproducible. Outcomes of some collective decisions are very little or not at all predictable. The development and simulation of a priori policy scenarios capturing the most plausible or interesting outcomes of such collective decisions on measures for low-water management allows these difficulties to be overcome. The building of these kind of scenarios requires close collaboration between researchers and stakeholders involved in arenas of collective choice, and implies the integration of the production of model and the analysis of scenarios as one component of the polycentric political process of water management...|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{and analyses}} {{the effects of}} the award restructuring process on aspects of the Northern Territory education industry. The special focus of the study was the <b>Master</b> Teacher <b>scheme</b> which was a major element of the implementation of award restructuring in the Northern Territory education sector. The study attempts to link conceptions of productivity attached to award restructuring with {{the effects of the}} <b>Master</b> Teacher <b>scheme,</b> and then to link these effects with any other conceptions of productivity which arise in the research. The data was collected from documents housed with the Australian Education Union (Northern Territory), twenty-five newly-confirmed master teachers, and six school and system administrators. A case study approach was used to determine the relationship between the aims of the award restructuring process and the effects of the <b>Master</b> Teacher <b>scheme.</b> This was cross-referenced with the views of the administrators, and the Northern Territory background to the implementation award restructuring. The results indicate that the <b>Master</b> Teacher <b>scheme</b> is generally providing teachers with access to the better careers foreshadowed in the Structural Efficiency Principle. Despite this, there still appear to be problems pertaining to the correlation of those perceived to be 2 ̆ 7 master teachers 2 ̆ 7 and those who are granted the status. It is likely that this difficulty is also linked with the other significant hindrance to productivity, which is {{the ways in which the}} appraisal process and the report which emerges from it can discourage a teacher. It also is clear that the <b>Master</b> Teacher <b>scheme</b> is neither the sole means of encouraging productivity nor the sole measure of it. Several of the master teachers indicated that they would have performed in the ways they had anyway, regardless of possible rewards. They were also aware of teachers who did not have master teacher status, but who were working in a highly professional and productive way. The ambiguities of the Literature are maintained to a significant degree. Using a selection of possible criteria, a process and a career structure, the Northern Territory Department of Education has sought to measure, reward and encourage productivity in the school system. The findings of this research show that it is not the total picture. Yet it is at least a small picture of how the professional and industrial paradigms of the workplace might join together to recognise the value of productivity in an educational context...|$|R
