40|$|An {{experimental}} {{performance evaluation}} {{was made of}} two movable sidewall variable area radial turbines. The turbine designs were representative of the gas generator turbine of a variable flow capacity rotorcraft engine. The first turbine was an uncooled design while the second turbine had a cooled nozzle but an uncooled rotor. The cooled nozzle turbine was evaluated both with and without coolant flow. The test {{results showed that the}} <b>movable</b> <b>nozzle</b> wall is a viable and efficient means to effectively control the flow capacity of a radial turbine. Peak efficiencies of the second turbine with and without nozzle coolant were 86. 5 and 88 percent respectively. These values are comparable to pivoting vane variable geometry turbines; however, the decrease in efficiency as the flow was varied from the design value was much less for the movable wall turbine. Several design improvements which should increase the turbine efficiency one or two more points are identified. These design improvements include reduced leakage losses and relocation of the vane coolant ejection holes to reduce mainstream disturbance...|$|E

40|$|Sliding-mode-based contour-following {{controller}} {{for guidance}} and autopilot systems of launch vehicles Fu-Kuang Yeh This study addresses a sliding-mode-based contour-following controller design for guidance and autopilot systems of launch vehicles with highly maneuverable actuators, mainly {{consisting of the}} thrust vector control and side jet systems, to perform the trajectory-tracking task given a predetermined trajectory. In particular, the trajectory is pre-designed by the method of calculus of variations with focus on maximizing the final velocity transferring to the orbit to obtain the optimal trajectory for a launch vehicle throughout the whole course. Chiefly, an integrated guidance/autopilot controller is designed to achieve the main goal of robust tracking issues for launch vehicles in real time such that the relative motion between a vehicle and the predetermined trajectory is minimized. As for the attitude control, an autopilot system is designed not only to stabilize {{the attitude of the}} launch vehicle but also to realize the guidance law of the translational motion control. In order to establish a complete system model, besides the motion dynamics of launch vehicles, we also take into account several influential factors such as the propellant effort of a <b>movable</b> <b>nozzle</b> thrust vector control and side jet systems, aerodynamic influence, the Earth’s gravitational field, and wind gusts/shears. The overall stability of the integrated guidance/autopilot system is assured via rigorous analysis by Lyapunov stability theory, and its corresponding performance is verified by numerical simulations...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to {{elucidate}} the effects of the important spray characteristics on the surface morphology and light absorbance of spray-on P 3 HT:PCBM thin-films, used as an active layer in polymer solar cells (PSCs). Spray coating or deposition is a viable scalable technique for the large-scale, fast, and low-cost fabrication of solution-processed solar cells, and has been widely used for device fabrication, although the fundamental understanding of the underlying and controlling parameters, such as spray characteristics, droplet dynamics, and surface wettability, is still limited, making the results on device fabrication not reproducible and unreliable. In this paper, following the conventional PSC architecture, a PEDOT:PSS layer is first spin-coated on glass substrates, followed by the deposition of P 3 HT:PCBM using an automatic ultrasonic spray coating system, with a <b>movable</b> <b>nozzle</b> tip, to mimic an industrial manufacturing process. To gain insight, the effects of the spray carrier air pressure, the number of spray passes, the precursor flow rate, and precursor concentration are studied on the surface topography and light absorbance spectra of the spray-on films. Among the results, it is found that despite the high roughness of spray-on films, the light absorbance of the film is satisfactory. It is also found that the absorbance of spray-on films is a linear function of the number of spray passes or deposition layers, based on which an effective film thickness is defined for rough spray-on films. The effective thickness of a rough spray-on P 3 HT:PCBM film was found to be one-quarter of that of a flat film predicted by a simple mass balance...|$|E
40|$|Directly-irradiated {{fluidized}} bed solar reactors are very promising {{in the context}} of solar chemistry and concentrated solar power (CSP) applications. With proper choice of the bed solids, {{fluidized bed}} reactors can be operated at fairly high process temperatures that enable thermochemical storage with high energy density and production of solar chemicals and fuels. Bed surface overheating upon irradiation is one key to the efficiency of the fluidized bed as thermal receiver and may be responsible for sintering and/or degradation of the fluidized particles. Tailoring the hydrodynamics of the bed close to the region where the incident power is concentrated may disclose effective measures to improve the interaction between the incident radiative flux and the bed and mitigate bed surface overheating. In the present study radiative heat transfer from a concentrated simulated solar radiation source to a fluidized bed is investigated by time-resolved infrared mapping of the bed surface temperature. A fluidized bed of silicon carbide particles (0. 127 mm), whose cross-sectional area is 0. 78 × 0. 78 m, was directly irradiated by highly concentrated simulated solar radiation, emitted by a 4 kWel short-arc Xe lamp coupled with an elliptical reflector. The experimental apparatus is also equipped with a <b>movable</b> <b>nozzle</b> coupled with a bubble generation system located coaxially to the concentrated simulated solar beam. The interaction of the concentrated radiative flux with the fluidized particles moving under the action of bubble bursting was assessed by characterizing the time-resolved bed surface temperature as the fluidization gas velocity was varied.

40|$|The {{baseline}} for a {{space shuttle}} configuration utilizing two parallel-burn, 156 -in. -diameter SRMs with three segments and techroll seal <b>movable</b> <b>nozzles</b> is presented. The concept and general economic benefits of SRM recovery are equally valid for the series-burn SRMs, provided that those SRMs are also designed for the same strength, stiffness, segmentation, and interchangeability as the present design, and that those SRMs are also recovered as individual units. Feasibility studies were initiated to investigate SRM recoverability. These studies were based upon recovery of the SRM boosters for the Titan 3 C. Ground rules precluded SRM modification that required significant changes in motor qualification or schedule. Even with this restriction, the study determined that the recoverable booster concept was completely feasible, both technically and economically. Parachute recovery has been selected as the best method, principally because it can accomplish the task with a minimum development cost and time to achieve operational recovery status.

40|$|It is a {{well known}} fact that most Francis turbines, because of the fixed blade design, faces {{challenges}} when running at partial load operation. Especially in the operating range below approximately 50 % of the rated output, {{it is common to}} observe severe pressure pulsations and surge in the draft tube. These pressure fluctuations are believed {{to be related to the}} swirling flow exiting the runner. By using water jets in the draft tube cone directed towards the swirling flow, the swirl strength is believed to be reduced and thereby also the pressure fluctuations produced by the swirl. This system thus has a potential of increasing the turbine operating range. The system can be activated when needed, and will not affect the turbine when running at its best efficiency point. Based on the main hypothesis, a simplified swirl rig was designed and constructed in order to investigate the nozzle influence on the swirling flow and on the pressure pulsations in a simplified environment. To expand the understanding of the nozzle performance in a Francis turbine, experiments were conducted in a model turbine with a prototype of <b>movable</b> <b>nozzles.</b> To establish a link between laboratory nozzle measurements and full scale nozzle measurements, field measurements were carried out on full scale Francis turbines running at partial discharge. For this purpose the turbines installed at Skarsfjord Power Station and Skibotn Power Station were used, where full scale nozzle injection systems were installed. The test results suggested that the concept of water injection worked, but not unconditionally. A reduction in pressure fluctuations was achieved both in laboratory and field experiments, as well as a noticeable reduction regarding fluctuations in the shaft run-out at Skibotn. In addition, water injection gave a surprisingly positive effect at overload conditions in the model turbine, even though the nozzle angle was directed in the same direction as the overload swirl. Ideally, the results from this project should be presented as a linear equation to give the ideal nozzle configuration for a given operating condition. This has not yet been possible because of the complexity of the system and its variable factors. However, several effects from changing nozzle variables individually have been detected, and are summarized in chapter 1 - Conclusions and Achievements. Efficiency measurements in the laboratory and in the field experiments indicated a possibility of increasing the hydraulic efficiency with the water injection system activated. This positive feature was believed to be caused by improvement of the velocity field in the draft tube. However, the total efficiency was always decreased because of the nozzle water bypass.
