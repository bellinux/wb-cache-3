40|$|Environmental {{changes at}} home and abroad as well as rapid {{advancement}} in ocean technology are calling for a great shift in the perception of the <b>maritime</b> <b>industry</b> and for new policy measures. This situation demands that researchers provide policy-makers with accessible and reliable information regarding the role of the <b>maritime</b> <b>industry.</b> This study employs input-output (I-O) analysis to examine the role of the <b>maritime</b> <b>industry</b> in the national economy for the period 1975 - 1998, with specific application to Korea. This paper, therefore, has two major goals. The first is the development of a static I-O framework for examining the role of the <b>maritime</b> <b>industry</b> in the short run.

25|$|With {{the buildup}} of the Royal Naval {{establishment}} in {{the first decades of}} the 19th century, a large number of military fortifications and batteries were constructed, and the numbers of regular infantry, artillery, and support units that composed the British Army garrison were steadily increased. The investment into military infrastructure by the War Office proved unsustainable, and poorly thought-out, with far too few artillery men available to man the hundreds of guns emplaced. Many of the forts were abandoned, or removed from use, soon after construction. Following the Crimean War, the trend was towards reducing military garrisons in colonies like Bermuda, partly for economic reasons, and partly as it became recognised that the Royal Navy's own ships could provide a better defence for the Dockyard, and Bermuda. Still, the important strategic location of Bermuda meant that the withdrawal, which began, at least in intent, in the 1870s, was carried out very slowly over several decades, continuing until after World War I. The last Regular Army units were not withdrawn until the Dockyard itself closed in the 1950s. In the 1860s, however, the major build-up of naval and military infrastructure brought vital money into Bermuda at a time when its traditional <b>maritime</b> <b>industries</b> were giving way under the assault of steel hulls and steam propulsion. The American Civil War, also, briefly, provided a shot-in-the-arm to the local economy. Tourism and agricultural industries would develop in the latter half of the 19th century. However, it was defence infrastructure that formed the central platform of the economy into the 20th century.|$|E

500|$|The {{second reading}} of the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Industries</b> Bill passed by only four votes, with Hughes, Edward Mann and George Maxwell voting against the government. Hughes moved an {{amendment}} to the bill that stipulated it should only take effect after being approved by the people at a referendum or general election. Bruce ruled out any referendum, stating that the amendment would constitute a vote of confidence in his government and urged his party to vote it down. Nationalist MP Walter Marks and Independent MP William McWilliams joined the opposition, giving the opposition a one-vote majority. Bruce and his supporters now lobbied the Speaker, Sir Littleton Groom to make a deliberative vote in committee to tie the numbers, leaving the Committee chairman James Bayley with the casting (and presumably pro-government) vote. Groom refused, citing long-standing Westminster (though not Australian) parliamentary tradition of the speaker's impartiality. Groom's bitterness at having been dismissed by Bruce from the job of Attorney-General in 1925 had a significant bearing on his later decision.|$|E
500|$|Bruce and {{the conservatives}} in {{parliament}} became increasingly convinced that [...] "economic deterioration [...] the product, {{rather than the}} possible cause, of worsening industrial relations." [...] Exasperated, the Prime Minister made a dramatic move and presented an ultimatum to the Australian state governments: either they should voluntarily hand their powers of industrial regulation to the federal government, or {{the federal government would}} divest itself of its industrial powers and dismantle federal arbitration. The announcement came as a major shock to all sides of politics, not least the members of Bruce's own cabinet, most of whom had not been informed of the dramatic change in policy until the day it was announced to the states. Bruce calculated that the states would not give up their powers, and thus the move was one designed to sanction the end of Commonwealth arbitration. For Bruce, the only inconceivable outcome now was that the status quo of dual jurisdiction remained unchanged. The opposition to the proposal, which the Prime Minister introduced to the parliament as the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Industries</b> Bill, was swift and fierce. In 1929 over 150 unions and 700,000 workers were covered by Commonwealth awards over a wide range of industries although there was dissatisfaction in the coal and timber sectors, most were happy with their arrangements and feared worse pay and conditions if moved back to state awards. He defended his actions as being necessary to create certainty and end the duplication that had caused so many problems in recent years.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to better {{understand}} Norwegian firms’ perception of the Portuguese strengths and weaknesses as a destination for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). The focus will be on the Norwegian <b>maritime</b> <b>industry,</b> more specifically shipbuilding, repair and services.

The single case study approach is utilized to understand the different aspects of the research questions. The data collection was performed through primary and secondary data. Three interviews were conducted with knowledgeable actors in the Norwegian <b>maritime</b> <b>industry.</b> The findings indicate there are areas for improvements and areas that can be further utilized and developed. The geographical location, natural resources, highly educated personnel, governmental emphasis, and excess capacity are found through primary and secondary data collection to be favorable aspects in the Portuguese <b>maritime</b> <b>industry.</b> The lack of skilled workers in production, regulatory complexity, macroeconomic instability, and difference in prosperity level between the Norwegian and Portuguese <b>maritime</b> <b>industry,</b> are found to be potential distortions.
