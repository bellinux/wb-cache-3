500|$|Mouton's 1982 season {{started with}} a big {{accident}} at the Monte Carlo Rally. On stage twelve {{in the small town}} Briançonnet in Provence, she missed a patch of ice and slid off the road, crashing into the stone wall of a large house at 110km/h (70mph). Mouton injured her knee while Pons suffered a concussion. She had been in third place, and had set the fastest time for the difficult Col de Turini mountain pass. The pair's injuries were not serious and Mouton went on to make her debut in the Swedish Rally. She was running third when she slid into a snow bank, and crashed into the Quattro of teammate Hannu Mikkola who had gone off at the same place. She eventually finished fifth. In Portugal, Mouton recorded 18 stage wins on her way to a clear victory ahead of Toyota's Per Eklund. She once admitted that to be competitive in the rally, she tried to think of the large crowds right {{by the side of the}} route as trees. At the Tour de Corse, she could not match the pace of the leaders and finished seventh. At the Acropolis Rally, Mouton won ahead of the Opel duo Walter Röhrl and Henri Toivonen, and closed to within 20 points of the championship leader Röhrl. The event was overshadowed by two serious accidents, one of which killed a spectator. Mouton had commented: [...] "I'm afraid that something might break in <b>my</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> I can no longer avoid hitting a spectator." ...|$|E

They were just recorded for my own listening sake, and burning a CD of it and putting it in <b>my</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> giving it to my friends." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the biggest {{influence}} on him in comedy, Chappelle spoke highly praise to Richard Pryor, [...] "What a precedent he set. Not just as a comic, but as a dude.

But to open yourself up for everybody: I freebase, I beat my women, I shot <b>my</b> <b>car.</b> <b>And</b> nobody's mad at Richard for that. They understand. Somehow they just understand.

Consequently, he was Rowling's first choice to direct Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in 2000, but Warner Bros. {{ultimately}} chose Chris Columbus for the job. In response to this decision, Gilliam said that [...] "I was the perfect guy to do Harry Potter. I remember leaving the meeting, getting in <b>my</b> <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> driving for about two hours along Mulholland Drive just so angry. I mean, Chris Columbus' versions are terrible. Just dull. Pedestrian." [...] In 2006, Gilliam said that he found Alfonso Cuarón's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to be [...] "really good... much closer to what I would've done." [...] In retrospect, however, Gilliam has stated that he wouldn't have liked to direct any Potter film. In a 2005 interview with Total Film, he said that he would not enjoy working on such an expensive project because of interference from studio executives.|$|E

He knew of the [...] "Indian Star" [...] as an actor, more so probably because his romance with Suraiya was grabbing the headlines, and they had a chat. The second time they met was in Rome when Dev Anand was on his way back from the Venice Film Festival, he visited him on the set of Roman Holiday. [...] "I was returning from the Venice film fest. I stopped <b>my</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> joined the crowd watching the shoot, hoping that his eyes would fall on me. As expected, he nodded and I walked up to him. He remembered me and we exchanged pleasantries." [...] The third meeting was at London on the set of Moby Dick. However, Suraiya asked for an exclusive meeting with her idol at her house. Though Anand says jealousy was natural for anyone in love, he didn't mind that he was not invited. [...] "I didn't quite feel anything. It wasn't as if they were going to fall in love or make love. Even if they would have, it wouldn't have mattered. I was mature enough. Moreover, he wasn't my rival. I too was a big star by then," [...] says Anand.|$|E

'Kathy' has always been so close to my heart and it's absolutely wonderful returning to the show and reprising the role." [...] It was then confirmed that Taylforth would reprise her role indefinitely. While Taylforth was initially only contracted to the series for six months, she said that she'd love {{to stay on the}} series for good. Of the return, Treadwell-Collins said [...] "Six months ago, we set ourselves that challenge of bringing Kathy back to the Square in a credible way. And I believe we have succeeded." [...] Taylforth revealed that she was initially hesitant about the storyline. [...] "I couldn't understand how they could work around the fact that she could do that to her children" [...] the actress explained. Taylforth said [...] "it had to be right." [...] In September 2015, Treadwell-Collins revealed to the Daily Mirror that the story was inspired by the real life John Darwin disappearance where John—also known as the Canoe man—with the help of his wife Anne faked his death in a canoe accident in March 2002 in order to claim the insurance. Kathy's husband Gavin Sullivan (Paul Nicholas) had convinced her to fake her death to keep her children safe.|$|E

My only wonder was that he had not carried them out. We then proceeded to Bridgeport, where we stopped for the night. From here we took horses and made our way by Jasper and over Waldron's Ridge to Chattanooga. There had been much rain, and the roads were almost impassable from mud, knee-deep in places, and from wash-outs on the mountain sides. I had been on crutches since the time of my fall in New Orleans, and had to be carried over places where it was not safe to cross on horseback. The roads were strewn with the debris of broken wagons and the carcasses of thousands of starved mules and horses. At Jasper, some ten or twelve miles from Bridgeport, there was a halt. General O. O. Howard had his headquarters there. From this point I telegraphed Burnside to make every effort to secure five hundred rounds of ammunition for his artillery and small-arms. We stopped for the night at a little hamlet some ten or twelve miles farther on. The next day we reached Chattanooga a little before dark. I went directly to General Thomas's headquarters, and remaining there a few days, until I could establish my own.|$|E
