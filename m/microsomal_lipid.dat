40|$|The {{presence}} of an enzymatic lipid peroxidation system in microsomal fractions of beef or pork muscle has been demonstrated in this study. The enzymatic reaction required ADP, NADPH or NADH, and ferrous or ferric iron. When intact muscles or isolated microsomes were stored at - 70 °C {{for up to a}} month, the enzyme activity of the microsomes did not change. Metmyoglobin (MetMb) in the {{presence of}} hydrogen peroxide initiated <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipid</b> peroxidation, whereas no oxidation occurred in the presence of MetMb or hydrogen peroxide alone. With 10 [mu]M to 50 [mu]M ferrous iron alone, there was significant stimulation of <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipid</b> peroxidation. From 100 [mu]M to 250 [mu]M, the ferrous iron alone caused no lipid peroxidation. The addition of hydrogen peroxide may have different effects on <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipid</b> peroxidation depending on the concentration of ferrous iron. Antioxidants such as BHT, EDTA, [alpha]-tocopherol and ascorbic acid in either enzymatic or non-enzymatic systems inhibited <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipid</b> peroxidation;The Mutatox°ler test {{has been shown to be}} a good alternative to the Ames test. The test provides a rapid, screening test which can be used to assay the mutagenicity of a large numbers of pure and complex compounds. Five different column fractions isolated from either autoxidized methyl linoleate or autoxidized methyl linolenate were not mutagenic with or without the activation by the S- 9 (microsomal) fraction. Chlorinated fatty acids including chloroethyl caprate, laurate, palmitate and linoleate were mutagenic in the presence of S- 9 activation. When heated at 180 °C, after 32 hours soybean oil exhibited mutagenic activity with or without the S- 9 activation. The addition of 1 % cholesterol into the soybean oil increased the onset of the mutagenicity. This study indicated that aflatoxin B[subscript] 1 (AFB[subscript] 1), methyl-imidazo-quinoline (MeIQ), tryptophan pyrolysates (Trp-P- 1 and Trp-P- 2) were mutagenic in the presence of S- 9 activation, while AFB[subscript] 1 epoxide and fumonisin B[subscript] 1 showed direct mutagenic activity and AFB[subscript] 2 and ochratoxin A were not mutagenic...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of a fat-free diet on the lipid dynamics of rat liver microsomes and liposomes of <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipids</b> was studied by using different fluorescence methods. Lifetime distribution and rotational diffusion of probes with different localization in the lipid bilayer were measured using multifrequency fluorometry. Lateral mobility was studied by measuring excimer formation of pyrenedodecanoic acid. Dipolar relaxation in the interfacial region was studied using 2 -dimethylamino- 6 -lauroylnaphthalene (Laurdan). In spite of large changes in the fatty acid composition of <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipids,</b> polyunsaturated fatty acid deficiency showed {{no effect on the}} lifetime distribution and rotational mobility of 1, 6 -diphenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene (DPH), 1 -(4 -(trimethylamino) phenyl) - 6 -phenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene (TMA-DPH), 2 -, 7 - and 12 -(9 -anthroiloxy) stearic acids. The treatment did not change the lateral diffusion of pyrenedodecanoic acid, either. However, generalized polarization of Laurdan fluorescence was higher in polyunsaturated fatty acid deficient microsomes as compared to the polyunsaturated fatty acid sufficient ones. This effect was also observed in liposomes of the total <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipids,</b> indicating that the changes in fatty acid composition resulting from polyunsaturated fatty acid deficiency produced a small but significant decrease in the rate of dipolar relaxation in the region of the lipid polar groups of the bilayer. The absence of lipid gel phase domains in rat liver microsomes was also indicated by Laurdan fluorescence features...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects on}} {{cellular}} structures of products of peroxidation of rat liver <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipids</b> were investigated. A system containing actively peroxidizing liver microsomal fraction {{was separated from}} a revealing or target system by a dialysis membrane. The target system, contained in the dialysis tube, consisted of either intact cells (erythrocytes) or subcellular fractions (liver microsomal fraction). When liver microsomal fractions were incubated with NADPH (or an NADPH-generating system), lipid peroxidation, {{as measured by the}} amount of malonaldehyde formed, occurred very rapidly. The malon-aldehyde concentration tended to equilibrate across the dialysis membrane. When the target system consisted of erythrocytes, haemolysis occurred abruptly after a lag phase. The lysis was greatly accelerated when erythrocytes from vitamin E-deficient rats were used, but no haemolysis was observed when erythrocytes from vitamin E-treated rats were used. When, in the same system, freshly prepared liver microsomal fractions were exposed to diffusible factors produced by lipid peroxidation, the glucose 6 -phosphatase activity markedly decreased. A similar decrease in glucose 6 -phosphatase activity, as well as a smaller but significant decrease in cytochrome P- 450, was observed when the target microsomal fractions were exposed to diffusible factors derived from the peroxidation of liver <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipids</b> in a separate preincubation step. These and additional experiments indicated that the toxicological activity is relatively stable. Experiments in which the hepatic microsomal fractions destined for lipid peroxidation contained radioactively labelled arachidonic acid, previously incorporated into the membranes, showed that part of the radioactivity released from the microsomal fraction into the incubation medium entered the dialysis tube and was recovered bound to the constituents of the microsomal fractions of the target system. These results indicate that {{during the course of the}} peroxidation of liver <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipids</b> toxic products are formed that are able to induce pathological effects at distant loci...|$|R

The liver perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) concentrations in the Blokkersdijk mice were extremely high (0. 47 – 178. 55 µg/g wet weight). Perfluorononanoic, perfluorodecanoic, perfluoroundecanoic, and perfluorododecanoic acids were found sporadically in the liver tissue of the Blokkersdijk mice. The liver PFOS concentrations at Galgenweel were significantly lower than those at Blokkersdijk (0. 14 – 1. 11 µg/g wet weight). Further results suggest sex independence of the liver PFOS levels, increased levels of PFOS bioaccumulation in older mice, and maternal PFOS transfer to the young. Several liver end points were significantly elevated in the Blokkersdijk mice: liver weight, relative liver weight, peroxisomal β-oxidation activity, <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipid</b> peroxidation level, and mitochondrial fraction protein content. For the mitochondrial fraction catalase activity, no significant difference between locations was found.

40|$|AbstractOral {{administration}} of the adrenal steroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a peroxisome proliferator and hepatocarcinogen in the rat, caused an increase in NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation in microsomes isolated from rat liver and kidney cortex, but not from brain. The increase of liver <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipid</b> peroxidation was greater in male than in female rats. The effect of DHEA on lipid peroxidation became discernible after feeding steroid-containing diet (0. 6 %) to male and female rats for 2 and 3 days and reached maximal levels at 1 and 2 weeks, respectively. The increase of <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipid</b> peroxidation reached a plateau stimulation at 0. 05 % in the diet. The addition of DHEA in the concentration range 0. 1 – 100 μM to microsomes isolated from control rats {{had no effect on}} lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, a significant increase of the endogenous concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances was found in microsomes after DHEA-administration at 0. 05 % in the diet. These results provide in vivo evidence that DHEA can cause lipid peroxidation in rat liver. Administration of DHEA at 0. 6 % in the diet for 7 consecutive days also significantly enhanced NADH- and ascorbate-dependent lipid peroxidation in liver microsomes. The DHEA-stimulated rat liver <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipid</b> peroxidation was completely inhibited by EDTA but not by superoxide dismutase, catalase or mannitol applied as OH-radical scavenger. The findings indicate that membrane lipid peroxidation is an early effect of DHEA, and that this process may be involved in the steroid-induced carcinogenesis in rats...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{tetrachloride}} (CCl 4) -induced liver necrosis in alloxan diabetic rats is markedly {{more intense}} than in controls as established by determination of isocitric dehydrogenase activity in plasma or by histological techniques. The covalent binding (CB) of CCl 4 reactive metabolites to liver <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipids</b> is higher in alloxan diabetic rats than in controls.

40|$|Dexamethasone, a {{synthetic}} glucocorticoid, {{was administered to}} pregnant rats {{during the last week}} of pregnancy in order to examine its effects on the fluidity of the developing fetal-rat liver microsomal membrane. This early prenatal exposure to dexamethasone, which preceded the natural appearance of fetal corticosteroids, markedly accelerated the normal perinatal course of fluidization of this membrane. The lipid apparent microviscosity, which was determined by measurement of fluorescence polarization, decreased in 21 -days-old treated fetuses to values that were indistinguishable from those of untreated newborn rats. This dexamethasone-mediated acceleration of membrane fluidization was associated with an increase in the index of unsaturation of the fatty acyl moiety of <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipids.</b> Dexamethasone caused {{a significant increase in the}} microsomal content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (arachidonic and linoleic acid), which was accompanied by a decrease in content of monoenoic fatty acids (oleic and palmitoleic acid).

40|$|The {{regulation}} of microsomal and plastidial oleate desaturases by {{low and high}} temperature, darkness, and wounding was investigated. To this end, their gene expression levels and the fatty acid composition was determined in the mesocarp tissue of olive fruit from the Picual and Arbequina varieties subjected to the corresponding stress treatments. Firstly, a plastidial oleate desaturase from olive was cloned and its functional identity was confirmed by overexpression in Escherichia coli. The results showed that temperature and light regulate olive oleate desaturase genes at transcriptional level. However, no correlation between their expression levels and the linoleic acid content in <b>microsomal</b> and plastidial <b>lipids</b> was found. In addition, the involvement of microsomal but not plastidial oleate desaturases in the wounding response of olive fruit mesocarp is demonstrated.

Methylene chloride was more highly activated in an oxygen containing atmosphere by hepatocytes, {{consistent with a}} proposed formation of formyl chloride as its reactive intermediate. Trichloroethylene was also shown to be more highly activated in an oxygen containing atmosphere, consistent with a proposed trichloroethylene epoxide reactive intermediate. Carbon tetrachloride was shown to be more highly activated in an oxygen-free atmosphere, consistent with a proposed trichloromethyl free radical reactive intermediate. Hepatocytes from rats pretreated with phenobarbital to induce cytochrome P- 450 mixed function oxidase activated carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethylene to alkylating intermediates greater than did hepatocytes from non-induced rats. The interaction of carbon tetrachloride metabolites with fatty acids was studied in a chemical activation model system. The thermal decomposition of benzoyl peroxide produced free radicals which activated carbon tetrachloride. The resulting trichloromethyl free radicals abstracted a hydrogen from methyl stearate resulting in chloroform and fatty acid free radicals. Using chemical ionization mass spectrometry, {{it was discovered that}} the fatty acid free radical abstracted a chlorine from carbon tetrachloride resulting in chlorinated fatty acid esters. When methyl oleate was used as a substrate in the benzoyl peroxide model system, it was discovered that the trichloromethyl free radical binds covalently, resulting in a fatty acid adduct radical. This radical then abstracted a chlorine to produce chloro, trichloromethyl stearic acid methyl ester, identified by chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Carbon tetrachloride radiolabeled with ¹⁴C or ³⁶Cl in dual label binding experiments in the benzoyl peroxide model system confirmed the mass spectral data. Methyl stearate bound ³⁶Cl- and ¹⁴C-carbon tetrachloride in the ratio of approximately 10 to 1, whereas methyl oleate bound in the ratio of approximately 3. 5 to 1. The existence of fatty acid radicals due to hydrogen abstraction or covalent binding by trichloromethyl free radicals was demonstrated in microsomal preparations. In the presence of tritiated water and ¹⁴C-carbon tetrachloride, dual-label analysis demonstrated that the tritium incorporation into <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipids</b> approximately equalled the sum of carbon tetrachloride metabolites bound covalently to <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipids</b> and chloroform production...|$|R
40|$|Characteristics of {{a typical}} male-dominant reaction, {{dealkylation}} of rc-propoxycoumarin, in rat livers were studied in relation to microsomal testosterone 6 #-hydroxylase. The depropylation was more than 10 -fold higher in the liver of male than female adult rats, but the sex-related difference was eliminated by neonatal castration. Hypophysectomy of adult male rats, which decreased the rates of male-specific P- 450 -male-dependent reactions, increased the depropylation of propoxycoumarin, while the rate was decreased by either intermittent injection or continuous infusion of human growth hormone to hypophysectom-ized rats. With regard to age-related difference, microsomal depropylation was detectable at neonate and reached a maximal level at 14 to 20 d of age, but was abruptly diminished only in female rats at puberty. These changes are in good agreement with those of testosterone 6 / 9 -hydroxylation {{and the content of}} a male-specific P- 4506 ^-i/PB-l. In reconstituted systems using extracted <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipids,</b> P- 4506 /,_,/PB-l and P- 450 -male catalyzed the depropylation of propoxycoumarin. However, the microsomal depropylation was inhibited by antibodies which recognize P- 450 w_!/PB-l, but not P- 450 -male. These results indicate that microsomal depropylation of propoxycoumarin is catalyzed mainl...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{ethyl ether}} extract from Aquilegia vulgaris (L.) (Ranunculaceae) {{contains}} {{a lot of}} phenolic acids. Their hydroxyl groups are capable of donating hydrogen atoms at the initial stage of lipid peroxidation (LPO), which inactivates hydroxyperoxides formed from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and leads to breakdown of the propagation chain. Material and methods: Rats pretreated with acetaminophen (APAP) (600 mg/kg b. w., p. o.) were given ethyl ether extract (100 mg/kg b. w., p. o.) obtained from A. vulgaris herb.

40|$|Captodative {{substituted}} olefins are radical scavengers which {{react with}} free radicals to form stabilized radical adducts. One of those compounds, N-(paramethoxyphenylacetyl) dehydroalanine (AD- 5), may react and scavenge both superoxide anion (O- 2) and alk-oxyl radicals (RO.), {{and in this}} way prevent the appearance of their mediated biological effects. Nitrofurantoin and tert-butyl hydroperoxide were used as model compounds to stimulate free radical production and their mediated lipid peroxidation in rat liver microsomes. In addition, lipid peroxidation was also initiated by exposure of rat liver microsomal suspensions to ionizing radiation (gamma rays). The <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipid</b> peroxidation induced by these chemicals and physical agents was inhibited by the addition of AD- 5. These effects were dose-dependent in a millimolar range of concentration. In addition, AD- 5 has no effect on microsomal electron transport, showing that NADPH-cytochrome P 450 reductase activity was not modified. These data, together with the comparisons of the effects of AD- 5 and some antioxidant molecules such as superoxide dismutase, uric acid, and mannitol, support the conclusion that inhibition of lipid peroxidation by AD- 5 is the result of its free radical scavenger activity. In addition, the inhibitory effect of AD- 5 on <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipid</b> peroxidation was dependent {{of the nature of the}} free radical species involved in the initiation of the process, suggesting that O- 2 is scavenged more efficiently than RO...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{influence}} of experimental hyperthyroidism in the rat on the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and on liver <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipid</b> fatty-acid composition. Tri-iodothyronine treatment (25 micrograms/ 100 g body weight) daily for 3 weeks caused no significant changes in delta 9 (stearate) desaturation but a 24 % decrease in delta 6 (linoleate) desaturation. Much larger doses of tri-iodothyronine increased delta 9 desaturation. Liver microsomal fatty-acid composition in hyperthyroidism is altered with significantly increased proportions of stearate and arachidonate and decreased proportions of palmitate, palmitoleate, linoleate (C 18 : 2) and eicosa- 8, 11, 14 -trienoate (C 20 : 3). These changes, other than the decreases proportion of C 20 : 3 fatty acid, which {{may be due to}} the diminished delta 6 desaturase activity, cannot be attributed to changes in fatty-acid desaturation. Most of these changes were also found to be due not simply to the decreased weight gain or the increased food intake of the hyperthyroid animals. Only the decreased C 18 : 2 fatty-acid proportions could be mimicked by restricting food intake of control animals and none of the changes were prevented by restricting food intake of hyperthyroid animals. Thus most of the changes in <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipid</b> fatty-acid composition are likely to be due to a thyroid hormone effect on peripheral lipid mobilization or lipid degradation...|$|E
40|$|After {{a general}} introduction, the main {{pathways}} of ethanol metabolism (alcohol dehydrogenase, catalase, coupling of catalase with NADPH oxidase and microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system) are shortly reviewed. The cytochrome P 450 isoform (CYP 2 E 1) specifically involved in ethanol oxidation is discussed. The acetaldehyde metabolism and {{the shift of}} the NAD/NADH ratio in the cellular environment (reductive stress) are stressed. The toxic effects of acetaldehyde are mentioned. The ethanol-induced oxidative stress: the increased MDA formation by incubated liver preparations, the absorption of conjugated dienes in mitochondrial and <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipids</b> and the decrease in the most unsaturated fatty acids in liver cell membranes are discussed. The formation of carbon-centered (1 -hydroxyethyl) and oxygen-centered (hydroxyl) radicals during the metabolism of ethanol is considered: the generation of hydroxyethyl radicals, which occurs likely {{during the process of}} univalent reduction of dioxygen, is highlighted and is carried out by ferric cytochrome P 450 oxy-complex (P 450 –Fe 3 +O 2 ·−) formed during the reduction of heme-oxygen. The ethanol-induced lipid peroxidation has been evaluated, and {{it has been shown that}} plasma F 2 -isoprostanes are increased in ethanol toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Female Cb mice {{weighing}} 20 - 23 g {{were exposed}} to 800 ppm (in average) of 1, I, 2, 2. tetrachloroethane for 3 hours. Both triglyceride and phospholipid in the liver and plasma were determined at varying times after the exposure. On the other hand, there were observed the ultraviolet absorption spectra of microwmallipids in the liver at 90 minutes after the 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane or the carbon tetrachloride exposure. The results thus obtained are summarized as follows: 1. The increase of hepatic triglyceride contents attained the maximum level in the period between 20 and 25 hours after the exposure and declined to the initial levels at 90 hours later. 2. The plasma triglyceride levels decreased until 25 hours after the exposure, then tended to increase significantly and were {{much higher than the}} control levels in the period between 70 and 90 hours later. 3. Both liver and plasma phospholipid levels decreased gradually up to 25 hours after the exposure, then slowly recovered with almost the same rate of increase. 4. It was suggested that the inhalation of the above vapors induced a little change in <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipids</b> in the liver. </p...|$|R
40|$|We report {{here the}} results of a study {{performed}} on the livers of rats intoxicated with CCl 4 in order to investigate the dependence of 23 Na n. m. r. parameters on specific cell alterations. In this connection, CCl 4 represents a useful probe, since the hepatocellular damaging effects induced by this aliphatic halocarbon have been extensively investigated. The t 1 relaxationtimes of intracellular sodium ion under physiological conditions {{in the presence of the}} paramagnetic shift reagent dysprosium tripolyphosphate were investigated. The significant increase of t 1 in the livers of rats intoxicated with CCl 4 with respect to the t 1 relaxationtimes of normal rats was studied. Evidence is given that neither liver cell necrosis nor fat accumulation nor proliferative processes affected the observed t 1 lengthening. However, when t 1 relaxationtimes were measured in the livers of vitamin E-treated rats subsequently intoxicated with CCl 4 a significant shortening of t 1 with respect to the times measured in intoxicated rats was observed. We report {{the results of}} the present study, taking into consideration that peroxidation of <b>microsomal</b> <b>lipids</b> is the key factor in the CCl 4 -induced liver injury process and that vitamin E exerts an antioxidant action against CCl 4 -induced microsomal lipidperoxidation...|$|R
