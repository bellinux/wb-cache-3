The central {{government}} of the Han Dynasty (206 BC−220 AD) set Xuwen County administering the whole Leizhou Peninsula. It {{was one of the}} earliest departure points on the <b>Marine</b> <b>Silk</b> Road. The population spiked during the Tang (618-907) and Song (960-1279) dynasties.Large numbers of Putian people immigrated to the peninsula during the Song dynasty and soon formed Zhanjiang's linguistic and ethnic majority.|$|E

40|$|The {{discovery}} of a novel silk production system in a marine amphipod provides insights into the wider potential of natural silks. The tube-building corophioid amphipod Crassicorophium bonellii produces from its legs fibrous, adhesive underwater threads that combine barnacle cement biology with aspects of spider silk thread extrusion spinning. We characterised the filamentous silk as a mixture of mucopolysaccharides and protein deriving from glands representing two distinct types. The carbohydrate and protein silk secretion is dominated by complex β-sheet structures and a high content of charged amino acid residues. The filamentous secretion product exits the gland through a pore near {{the tip of the}} secretory leg after having moved through a duct, which subdivides into several small ductules all terminating in a spindle-shaped chamber. This chamber communicates with the exterior and may be considered the silk reservoir and processing/mixing space, in which the silk is mechanically and potentially chemically altered and becomes fibrous. We assert that further study of this probably independently evolved, <b>marine</b> arthropod <b>silk</b> processing and secretion system can provide not only important insights into the more complex arachnid and insect silks but also into crustacean adhesion cements...|$|R
