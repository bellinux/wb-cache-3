The assay is independent of small amounts of peroxidase activity. It is fairly simple to perform, it is rapid and it can be adapted to continuous reading of the reaction". A variety of drawbacks are also listed by the same authors, viz, the inactivation of the enzyme under the experimental conditions and the time lag before a constant rate of oxygen evolution is reached.

40|$|Abstract. Oxygen {{consumption}} of single mosquitoes {{was measured using}} a differential pressure transducer (DPT) connected to two small chambers. A mosquito {{was placed in the}} experimental chamber (P 1) and was separated from NaOH by 4 cm 2 of marquisette mesh. The reference chamber (P 2) contained the same amount of NaOH and the marquisette mesh but without a mosquito. When these two chambers were sealed, removed O 2 from P 1 resulted in a pressure decrease with respect to P 2. This pressure differential was transduced into an output voltage that was directly proportional to the amount of O 2 consumed by the mosquito. An array of eight DPTs was interfaced with an IBM 486 PC using an ADAC 5500 MF analog to digital converter and software from ADAC (Direct View) to automate the recording procedure. We determined that our apparatus was sensitive enough to detect subtle differences in O 2 consumption in mosquitoes subjected to different physiologic conditions. <b>Manometric</b> <b>methods</b> have been used extensively in the study of respiration and have produced a great variety of apparatus to carry out these measurements.

Peterson (1942) reported that of 82 organic compounds tested, only 6 (anisic, ethyoxyacetic and isovaleric acids, dex-trin, ethylene glycol and sorbitol) supported growth of Alcalignes faecalis in an otherwise in-organic medium.

The rate of oxidation of iron, however, decreases with increasing p° 2 -values, though {{in the case of}} cobalt the Og rate is independent of p values, A direct-logarithmic rate law is obeyed in the oxidation of both hexagonal close-packed and face centred-cubic structure of cobalt and the oxide- 0 thickness varies from 400 to 5000 A. The Arrhenius plots show, in all cases, an anomaly at the transformation temperature (namely, ~ 911 °C and 386 °C for the oxidation of iron and cobalt respectively). Such an anomaly is believed to be due to the effect of phase-boundary reactions on the oxidation kinetics.

Thompson and Johnson concluded that the major portion of the increase in bisulphite binding substances (B. B.

S. in the blood of fulminating cases of beriberi are due mainly to pyruvic acid. For 2 years an investigation has been in progress in this laboratory on patients with symptoms and signs of vitamin B 1 deficiency closely resembling those seen in oriental "wets " beriberi (8, (Received for publication May 4, 1937...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} important manometric metrics for the analysis of pharyngeal and upper esophageal sphincter (UES) function and to investigate the effect of viscosity and other confounding factors on <b>manometric</b> results. <b>Methods</b> <b>Manometric</b> studies were performed on 26 asymptomatic volunteers (12 men and 14 women; age, 19 - 81 years). The mano-metric protocol included 5 water swallows (5 mL), 5 barium swallows (5 mL) and 5 yogurt swallows (5 mL). Evaluation of high-resolution manometry parameters including basal pressure of the UES, mesopharyngeal contractile integral (mesophar-yngeal CI, mmHg ‧ cm ‧ sec), CI of the hypopharynx and UES (hypopharyngeal CI), relaxation interval of UES, median intrabolus pressure and nadir pressure at UES was performed using MATLAB. Results Mesopharyngeal CIs for barium and yogurt swallows were significantly lower than those for water swallows (both P < 0. 05). Hypopharyngeal CIs for water swallows were significantly lower than those for barium swallows (P = 0. 004), and median bolus pressure at UES for barium swallows was significantly higher than that for water and yogurt swallows (both P < 0. 05). Furthermore, hypopharyngeal CI and median intrabolus pressure at UES were significantly related to age for 3 swallows (all P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 05, respectively). A significant negative correlation was also noted between nadir pressure at UES and age for water and yogurt swallows (all P < 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 A {{comparative}} study {{was made of}} Pinus ponderosa Laws, and Arceuthobium campylopodum Engelm. f. campylopodum to determine (1) {{whether or not the}} parasite or parasitized tissues accumulate abnormal concentrations of minerals, (2) {{whether or not there was}} evidence of a blockage of mineral translocation in the phloem because of the parasite, and (3) whether or not changes occurred in host foliage which could be interpreted as mineral deficiency. Also, comparative analyses using chromatographic methods were made of simple carbohydrates and free amino acids. Quantitative analyses of carbohydrates also were carried out. <b>Manometric</b> <b>methods</b> were employed to evaluate the ability of host and parasite to utilize exogenously supplied carbohydrates and amino acids. Substances identified by chromatography in the host and parasite served as substrates in the respiration studies to determine their usability. The results showed the parasite and swollen bark ramified by the parasite to have higher contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium than bark adjacent to the swellings and sometimes more than the host foliage. Magnesium content was greatest in the parasite. No difference occurred between fusiform swellings and adjacent bark. Calcium was the exception in that it did not accumulate in the parasaite. No evidence was found that mineral translocation was blocked in the phloem except for calcium. Calcium was more abundant below the infection than above. No evidence was found which would substantiate the theory that the parasite caused mineral deficiencies in the host's foliage. Neither was the movement of sugars, as indicated by ouantitative analysis, interrupted by the mistletoe or the swollen bark from which it grew. The host contained raffinose which was not found in the parasite, and the parasite contained an unknown substance, possibly a uronic acid, a methylpentose or a deoxy sugar, which was not found in the host. Dwarf mistletoe aud its host contained virtually the same amino acids, the chief exception being the presence of cysteic acid and the absence of glycine in the parasite. Dwarf mietletoe was found to use a variety of sugars in its metabolism, including those identified from the host. Respiration of pine tigsues was not stimulated by the addition of carbohydrate. Tissues of both host and parasite responded to the addition of amino acid and amides...|$|R
