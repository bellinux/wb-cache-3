Our results show that when people engage with mobile search they tend to interact with more <b>mobile</b> apps <b>and</b> for longer durations. We found that certain categories of apps are used more intensely alongside mobile search. Fur-thermore we found differences in app usage before <b>and</b> af-ter <b>mobile</b> search <b>and</b> show how <b>mobile</b> app interactions can both prompt <b>mobile</b> search <b>and</b> enable users to take action. We conclude with a discussion on what these patterns mean for <b>mobile</b> search <b>and</b> how we might design mobile search experiences that take these app interactions into account...|$|R

5|$|As {{with other}} requiem sharks, the blacktip shark {{exhibits}} vivipary. Females typically {{give birth to}} four to seven (range one to 10) pups every other year, making use of shallow coastal nurseries that offer plentiful food and fewer predators. Known nurseries include Pine Island Sound, Terra Ceia Bay, and Yankeetown along the Gulf Coast of Florida, Bulls Bay {{on the coast of}} South Carolina, and Pontal do Paraná on the coast of Brazil. Although adult blacktip sharks are highly <b>mobile</b> <b>and</b> disperse over long distances, they are philopatric and return to their original nursery areas to give birth. This results in a series of genetically distinct breeding stocks that overlap in geographic range.|$|E
