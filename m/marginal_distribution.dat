2500|$|The Student's t-distribution, {{especially}} in its three-parameter (location-scale) version, arises frequently in Bayesian statistics {{as a result}} of its connection with the normal distribution.

[...] Equivalent constructions with the same results involve a conjugate scaled-inverse-chi-squared distribution over the variance, or a conjugate gamma distribution over the precision. [...] If an improper prior proportional to σ−2 is placed over the variance, the t-distribution also arises. This is the case regardless of whether the mean of the normally distributed variable is known, is unknown distributed according to a conjugate normally distributed prior, or is unknown distributed according to an improper constant prior.|$|E

A joint distribution in this class {{is characterized by a}} parametric copula function evaluated at nonparametric <b>marginal</b> <b>distributions.</b> This class of models has gained popularity in diverse fields due to a) its flexibility in separately modeling the dependence structure and the marginal behaviors of a multivariate random variable, and b) its circumvention of the "curse of dimensionality" associated with purely nonparametric multivariate distributions. We show that the plug-in sieve ML estimates of all smooth functionals, including the finite dimensional copula parameters and the unknown <b>marginal</b> <b>distributions,</b> are semiparametrically efficient; and that their asymptotic variances can be estimated consistently. Moreover, prior restrictions on the <b>marginal</b> <b>distributions</b> can be easily incorporated into the sieve ML procedure to achieve further efficiency gains.
