5|$|Hygiene {{is a set}} of {{practices}} to avoid infection or food spoilage by eliminating <b>microorganisms</b> from the surroundings. As <b>microorganisms,</b> in particular bacteria, are found virtually everywhere, harmful <b>microorganisms</b> may be reduced to acceptable levels rather than actually eliminated. In food preparation, <b>microorganisms</b> are reduced by preservation methods such as cooking, cleanliness of utensils, short storage periods, or by low temperatures. If complete sterility is needed, as with surgical equipment, an autoclave is used to kill <b>microorganisms</b> with heat and pressure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{invention}} of <b>microorganism’s</b> involvement in carbonate precipitation, has lead {{the exploration of}} this process {{in the field of}} construction engineering. Biocement is a product innovation from developing bioprocess technology called biocementation. Biocement refers to CaCO 3 deposit that formed due to <b>microorganism</b> activity in the system rich of calcium ion. The primary role of <b>microorganism</b> in carbonate precipitation is mainly due to their ability to create an alkaline environment (high pH and DIC increase) through their various physiological activities. Three main groups of <b>microorganism</b> that can induce the carbonate precipitation: (i) photosynthetic <b>microorganism</b> such as cyanobacteria and microalgae; (ii) sulphate reducing bacteria; and (iii) some species of <b>microorganism</b> involved in nitrogen cycle. Microalgae are photosynthetic <b>microorganism</b> and utilize urea using urease or urea amidolyase enzyme, based on {{that it is possible to}} use microalgae as media to produce biocement through biocementation. This paper overviews biocement in general, biocementation, type of <b>microorganism</b> and their pathways in inducing carbonate precipitation and the prospect of microalgae to be used in biocement production.

5|$|<b>Microorganisms</b> can {{be found}} almost {{anywhere}} on Earth. Bacteria and archaea are almost always microscopic, while a number of eukaryotes are also microscopic, including most protists, some fungi, {{as well as some}} micro-animals and plants.

5|$|<b>Microorganisms</b> {{can form}} an endosymbiotic {{relationship}} with other, larger organisms. For example, microbial symbiosis plays {{a crucial role}} in the immune system. The <b>microorganisms</b> that make up the gut flora in the gastrointestinal tract contribute to gut immunity, synthesize vitamins such as folic acid and biotin, and ferment complex indigestible carbohydrates. Some <b>microorganisms</b> that are seen to be beneficial to health are termed probiotics and are available as dietary supplements, or food additives.|$|E
5|$|Single-celled <b>microorganisms</b> {{were the}} first forms of life to develop on Earth, {{approximately}} 3–4 billion years ago. Further evolution was slow, and for about 3 billion years in the Precambrian eon, (much {{of the history of}} life on Earth), all organisms were <b>microorganisms.</b> Bacteria, algae and fungi have been identified in amber that is 220 million years old, which shows that the morphology of <b>microorganisms</b> has changed little since the Triassic period. The newly discovered biological role played by nickel, however — especially that brought about by volcanic eruptions from the Siberian Traps — may have accelerated the evolution of methanogens {{towards the end of the}} Permian–Triassic extinction event.|$|E
