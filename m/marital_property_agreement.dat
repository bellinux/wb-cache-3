40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of {{the requirements of the}} Bachelor of Laws Degree at Strathmore University Law SchoolMarital agreements have been used for the division of matrimonial property upon divorce by couples for several years. However, their enforcement has been challenging. In Kenya the Matrimonial Property Act allows spouses to make antenuptial/pre-nuptial agreements for the division of matrimonial property upon divorce. It however does not recognize post-nuptial and settlement agreements. This may pose a challenge to the realization of equality as per Article 45 (3) of the Constitution. This research has looked into the importance of recognizing post-nuptial and settlement agreements and how they contribute towards promoting equality between spouses in the ownership of matrimonial property. The study was conducted through a review of existing literature on the subject of <b>marital</b> <b>property</b> <b>agreements.</b> It has also included a comparative analysis of the South African and English law on <b>marital</b> <b>property</b> <b>agreements.</b> The aim of the comparative analysis was to identify best practices from these jurisdictions that {{can be applied to the}} Kenyan system. Additionally, a historical analysis of the Kenyan matrimonial property laws has been done so as to understand the importance of ensuring equality between spouses in the ownership of matrimonial property. In order to ensure that <b>marital</b> <b>property</b> <b>agreements</b> promote equality between spouses, the study recommends that there should be principles or guidelines that direct the court in dividing matrimonial property upon divorce as well as in the implementation and enforcement of marital agreements and finally that the law should give explicit recognition to post-nuptial and settlement agreement...|$|R

40|$|Journal articleThe {{issue of}} {{personal}} choice has become central to Canadian family law. Much {{of the debate}} derives from the competing models of autonomy posited by neoliberal and feminist theorists. Neoliberalism, which currently dominates Canadian public discourse, views individuals as atomistic agents who can and should make responsible choices. However, feminists have highlighted the effects of structural barriers and social context on personal decision-making, particularly for women, and have advanced alternative relational autonomy models. These models are particularly appropriate to family law, but their application to family financial ordering has not been widely considered. This article considers the practical significance of a relational autonomy approach {{in the context of}} spousal support (maintenance) and property agreements, focusing on the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada from 1987 to date. However, while the article centers on Canadian law, it also speaks to the broader debate on autonomy and fairness in family law generally. The article asks two core questions. First, to what extent has relational theory informed the Court s decisions on spousal support and marital property agreements? Second, do or would relational understandings make a practical difference in spousal support and <b>marital</b> <b>property</b> <b>agreement</b> cases? The article traces the evolution of autonomy theory in the Court s decisions on marital property and spousal support agreements. It contends that the Court has gradually adopted a largely, though not consistently, relational approach; however, this approach may not always make as much practical difference as some feminists might expect. Nevertheless, the article argues that a relational approach may be vitally significant in some cases. Consequently, the article concludes that it would be regrettable if so-called choice rhetoric were to displace relational understandings in this context...|$|E

The analysis leads to a conclusion that the legal situation of spouses is determined not so much by the very fact of marriage as by the <b>marital</b> <b>property</b> system that is binding in a given case.

However, at the same time there appear special legal regulations that refer to various public law issues, e. g. diverse forms of support within the Common Agricultural Policy.

40|$|The Legislature in {{enacting}} the North Carolina Act for Equitable Distribution of <b>Marital</b> <b>Property</b> {{altered the}} common law approach of dividing property upon divorce strictly according to record title. Under the new statute, marriage {{is viewed as a}} joint venture to acquire property through monetary and non-monetary efforts of each spouse. The Legislature authorizes the courts to reward these mutual efforts by dividing <b>marital</b> <b>property</b> in an equitable fashion. <b>Marital</b> <b>property</b> is that real or personal property acquired during marriage which is traceable to the joint efforts of both spouses. Under the new statute, only that property classified as 2 ̆ 2 <b>marital</b> <b>property</b> 2 ̆ 2 becomes divisible by the court. The appellate courts of North Carolina have had little opportunity to interpret the new statute and have not faced the difficult issue of whether a professional degree obtained by one spouse during marriage should be classified as <b>marital</b> <b>property.</b> The statute classifies professional licenses as separate, non-divisible property. While this classification exempts the professional license from distribution in North Carolina, the Legislature left unclear the issue of whether a professional degree could be valued and distributed upon divorce.
