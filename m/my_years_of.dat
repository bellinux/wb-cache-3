500|$|After a {{break of}} almost four months, Beholder {{returned}} in the Torrey Pines Stakes over one mile at Del Mar on September 1, {{where she was}} ridden {{for the first time}} by Gary Stevens. She started the 1–10 favorite and led all the way, winning from second-place finisher Wittgenstein. Four weeks later, Beholder was matched against older fillies and mares in the Grade I Zenyatta Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Santa Anita. She led from the start and won, with the six-year-old veteran Authenticity in second. Mandella called the winner [...] "a filly that really likes the fight" [...] while Stevens said that [...] "I haven't gotten close to the bottom of her yet". On November 1, Beholder contested the Breeders' Cup Distaff over nine furlongs at Santa Anita. The field was a very strong one, including Royal Delta who had won the race for the last two years, Princess of Sylmar, Authenticity, and Close Hatches. Although Beholder showed some anxiety in the starting gate, she had a clean start. Mandella had been training her so that instead of always being a front-runner, she could be [...] rated behind other horses and conserve energy. His strategy was a success as Beholder tracked the leaders before moving up into second place half a mile from the finish. She took the lead two furlongs out and went clear of the field to win by [...] lengths over Close Hatches, with Royal Delta fourth and Princess of Sylmar last of the six runners. After the race, Mandella said, [...] "I’ve been lucky enough to have many good mares in <b>my</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> training, but this mare might have to be the best of all." [...] With her Distaff win, she became the first horse to win both the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and the Distaff in consecutive years.|$|E

Rarely could either official be accused of whistling for a stoppage prematurely... Norling was also one of the more flamboyant referees. The crowd always knew when he was out there. At the same time, he was a top drawer referee and perhaps could get away with a bit of the showmanship because his decisions were generally spot-on.|$|E

Pictures of hospitals during the Crimean War showed terrible conditions, but even those could not compare with the dreadful sights I met on this visit. Shells of men lay on the floor sunken-eyed and helpless; some were swollen with hunger, oedema and ber-beri, others in the last stages of dysentery, lay unconscious and dying. They had no pillows or clothes, few cups, fewer bowls, or even medical supplies. [...] There were three hundred desperately sick men, many unable to help themselves, or to carry food to their mouths. Throughout our internment, we women had begged to be allowed to nurse the soldiers, but the Japanese refused our offer, saying this would be indecent".|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} her life, Leavitt {{fell out}} with WCTU leadership, and {{ultimately}} resigned from the organization.

Nixon was seventeen months into the Watergate scandal and coming back from a trip to his Key Biscayne home. Stopping at the Contemporary, which was hosting the 1973 Annual Convention of the Associated Press Managing Editors Association, the president held a live one-hour televised press conference in the Ballroom of the Americas. Following an earlier question by Joe Ungaro on Nixon's taxes, Nixon decided to address claims that he profited from his public service, stating [...] "I have earned every cent. And in all of <b>my</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> public life I have never obstructed justice... People have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I'm not a crook.

2500|$|Early {{studies of}} alcoholics who {{underwent}} LSD treatment reported a 50% success rate after a single high-dose session. However, {{the studies that}} reported high success rates had insufficient controls, lacked objective measures of genuine change, and failed to conduct rigorous follow-up interviews with subjects. The lack of conclusive evidence notwithstanding, individual case reports are often dramatic. Bill Wilson, the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous conducted medically supervised experiments in the 1950s {{on the effects of}} LSD on alcoholism. Bill is quoted as saying [...] "It is a generally acknowledged fact in spiritual development that ego reduction makes the influx of God's grace possible. If, therefore, under LSD we can have a temporary reduction, so that we can better see what we are and where we are going—well, that might be of some help. The goal might become clearer. So I consider LSD to be of some value to some people, and practically no damage to anyone. It will never take the place of any of the existing means by which we can reduce the ego, and keep it reduced." [...] Wilson felt that regular usage of LSD in a carefully controlled, structured setting would be beneficial for many recovering alcoholics. However, he felt this method only should be attempted by individuals with well-developed super-egos. In 1957 Wilson wrote a letter to Heard saying: [...] "I am certain that the LSD experiment has helped me very much. I find myself with a heightened colour perception and an appreciation of beauty almost destroyed by <b>my</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> depressions." [...] Most AA members were strongly opposed to his experimenting with a mind-altering substance.|$|E
2500|$|Jackie Sherrill, an {{assistant}} under Majors at Iowa State and Pitt {{and the head}} coach at Washington State, succeeded Majors as head coach at Pitt. Under Sherrill, the winning continued with a 9–2–1 record and Gator Bowl win in 1977. An 8–4 record and Tangerine Bowl appearance followed in 1978. Sherrill stockpiled future NFL talent including Pittsburgh's own quarterback Dan Marino, Hall of Fame inductee Russ Grimm, and Outland Trophy winner Mark May. Sherrill also molded a devastating defense that was anchored at the defensive end position manned by Hall of Fame inductee Rickey Jackson and Heisman Trophy runner-up Hugh Green, who had the highest finish in the Heisman voting by a defensive player until 1997, when Michigan's cornerback Charles Woodson, who also played receiver, won the trophy. 1979 began a string of three straight seasons with 11–1 records. However, an early loss at North Carolina in 1979, a midseason loss during a driving rainstorm at Florida State in 1980, and a devastating season-ending defeat {{at the hands of}} rival Penn State in 1981 prevented those teams from clinching an AP or Coaches poll national championship. The 1981 loss to Penn State at Pitt Stadium was especially devastating, as the number one ranked Panthers had opened up a 14–0 first-quarter lead only to see an apparent Dan Marino touchdown pass intercepted in the endzone. The Nittany Lions scored 48 unanswered points to end the Panthers' dream of a second national championship in five years. In each of these three seasons, Pitt rebounded to win a bowl game: the Fiesta, Gator, and Sugar Bowls respectively. The 1982 Sugar Bowl was highlighted by {{one of the most dramatic}} plays in Pitt history as Dan Marino hit a streaking John Brown on fourth down in the last seconds of the game for the go-ahead score against a Georgia team that featured Herschel Walker. Sherrill's teams at Pitt are considered by some to be among the most talented in Pitt and college football history. The 1980 Pitt team alone featured seven first round draft picks, 23 players who went on to start in the NFL, seven others who played in the NFL, and one player each who played in the CFL and the USFL. Bobby Bowden, legendary coach of Florida State, is quoted as saying, [...] "I've said it many times, in all <b>my</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> coaching, that Pitt team was the best college football team I have ever seen." [...] Sherrill left Pitt in early 1982 for Texas A, signing a then record contract worth over $1.7 million. In five seasons, Sherrill's Panthers won fifty games, lost nine, and tied one (50–9–1), which places his 0.842 winning percentage at the top of the list for all Pitt coaches, just ahead of Jock Sutherland.|$|E
