5|$|Other {{molecular}} phylogenetics analyses {{agree the}} redefined Platyhelminthes are most {{closely related to}} Gastrotricha, and both {{are part of a}} grouping known as Platyzoa. Platyzoa are generally agreed to be at least closely related to the Lophotrochozoa, a superphylum that includes molluscs and annelid worms. The <b>majority</b> <b>view</b> is that Platyzoa are part of Lophotrochozoa, but a significant minority of researchers regard Platyzoa as a sister group of Lophotrochozoa.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{starts with}} some criticisms of {{so-called}} standard realism. This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts {{that there is}} an isomorphism between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential web of beliefs. Among modern philosophers of mind, the <b>majority</b> <b>view</b> seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor departs from this view in accepting the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second.|$|E
5|$|Early writers {{combined}} ctenophores with cnidarians into {{a single}} phylum called Coelenterata on account of morphological similarities between the two groups. Like cnidarians, the bodies of ctenophores consist of a mass of jelly, with one layer of cells {{on the outside and}} another lining the internal cavity. In ctenophores, however, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only a single cell deep. Ctenophores also resemble cnidarians in relying on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration, as well as in having a decentralized nerve net rather than a brain. However, genomic studies have suggested that the neurons of Ctenophora, which differ in many ways from other animal neurons, evolved independently from those of the other animals, and increasing awareness {{of the differences between the}} groups has persuaded more recent authors to classify the two as separate phyla. The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated, and the <b>majority</b> <b>view</b> at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores.|$|E

5000|$|The {{organization}} absorbed Declare Yourself and the Student Association for Voter Empowerment, {{and began}} operations as a 501(c)(3) in March 2011. The organization says that its positions {{are based upon}} its assessment of <b>majority</b> <b>views</b> of the [...] millennial generation.|$|R
50|$|A 2016 poll of Russian {{citizens}} {{conducted by}} Levada Center {{showed that the}} <b>majority</b> <b>viewed</b> {{the collapse of the}} USSR negatively and felt {{that it could have been}} avoided, and an even greater number would openly welcome a revival of the Soviet system.|$|R
25|$|The Carpi were a {{sizeable}} group of tribes, who lived beyond the north-eastern boundary of Roman Dacia. The <b>majority</b> <b>view</b> among modern scholars {{is that the}} Carpi were a North Thracian tribe and a subgroup of the Dacians. However, some historians classify them as Slavs.|$|E
25|$|The Orthodox Church {{does not}} {{recognize}} as dogma any ecumenical councils other than these seven. Orthodox thinking differs on whether the Fourth and Fifth Councils of Constantinople were properly Ecumenical Councils, but the <b>majority</b> <b>view</b> {{is that they were}} merely influential rather than dogmatic and therefore not binding.|$|E
25|$|The four Sunni {{schools of}} Islamic jurisprudence, {{as well as}} Shi'a scholars, agree on the {{difference}} of punishment between male and female. A sane adult male apostate may be executed. A female apostate may be put to death, according to the <b>majority</b> <b>view,</b> or imprisoned until she repents, according to others.|$|E
5000|$|The ruling {{conflicts}} with established principles governing banking and {{bills of exchange}} law in Canada. The minority {{also noted that the}} <b>majority's</b> <b>view</b> of a joint account [...] "may negatively impact other areas of the law", which may require amendment of the relevant statutes.|$|R
50|$|On February 6, 2007, a {{three-judge panel}} of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the {{district}} court's class certification. Judge Harry Pregerson wrote for the majority, which also included Judge Michael Daly Hawkins. Judge Andrew J. Kleinfeld dissented and criticized the <b>majority's</b> <b>view</b> of the class certification standards.|$|R
25|$|The {{platform}} {{adopted by}} the delegates of the Green Party (United States) at their annual Green Congress May 26–28, 2000, reflecting the <b>majority</b> <b>views</b> of the membership, included the creation of self-reproducing, renewable energy systems and use of federal investments, purchasing, mandates, and incentives to shut down nuclear power plants and phase out fossil fuels.|$|R
25|$|After the war, Israeli and Palestinian historiographies {{differed}} on {{the interpretation}} of the events of 1948: in the West the <b>majority</b> <b>view</b> was of a tiny group of vastly outnumbered and ill-equipped Jews fighting off the massed strength of the invading Arab armies; it was also widely believed that the Palestinian Arabs left their homes on the instruction of their leaders.|$|E
25|$|The <b>majority</b> <b>view</b> {{appears to}} be that people such as King Hroðgar and the Scyldings in Beowulf are based on real {{historical}} people from 6th-century Scandinavia. Like the Finnesburg Fragment and several shorter surviving poems, Beowulf has consequently {{been used as a}} source of information about Scandinavian personalities such as Eadgils and Hygelac, and about continental Germanic personalities such as Offa, king of the continental Angles.|$|E
25|$|Orthodox Judaism {{considers}} {{organ donation}} obligatory {{if it will}} save a life, {{as long as the}} donor is considered dead as defined by Jewish law. In both Orthodox Judaism and non-Orthodox Judaism, the <b>majority</b> <b>view</b> holds that organ donation is permitted in the case of irreversible cardiac rhythm cessation. In some cases, rabbinic authorities believe that organ donation may be mandatory, whereas a minority opinion considers any donation of a live organ as forbidden.|$|E
50|$|Because {{people have}} self-concepts that {{are derived from}} a role they define for {{themselves}} {{within the context of}} a group, when staying within their roles, intergroup similarities are accentuated while intergroup differences are diminished. In an attempt to assimilate oneself according to the tendencies of a group, often people reconfigure their intragroup representations or identities. Certain prototypes form about these groups that reaffirm rules that members of the group are encouraged to follow. Shared information and views are discussed more often than novel and unshared information within a group, therefore a norm is established where the <b>majority</b> <b>views</b> are perpetuated and others silenced. This norm is fluid and changing according to different contexts, but those within the group who want to keep up with the <b>majority</b> <b>views</b> in all matters have to keep an active role in affirming the views of the in-group in contest to out-groups.|$|R
50|$|Opinions on the {{significance}} {{and the impact}} of the slogan differ. The article and several similar pieces were noticed by diplomats and government officials, French and foreign, and elicited press releases from Prime Minister Édouard Daladier and Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet, who noted that this sentiment did not represent the <b>majority</b> <b>views</b> of either the French public and the French government, and reaffirmed their support for the Polish-French alliance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{result of}} this is {{pressure}} on scientists to publish in the best journals, and pressure on universities to ensure access to that core set of journals. On the other hand, the set of [...] "core journals" [...] may vary more or less strongly with the individual researchers, and even more strongly along schools-of-thought divides. There is also a danger of over-representing <b>majority</b> <b>views</b> if journals are selected in this fashion.|$|R

25|$|By 1672, the Kangxi Emperor had {{determined}} that the feudatories were {{a threat to the}} Qing regime. In 1673, Shang Zhixin submitted a memorial requesting permission to retire and in August of the same year a similar request arrived from Wu Sangui, designed to test the court's intentions. The Kangxi Emperor went against the <b>majority</b> <b>view</b> in the Council of Princes and High Officials and accepted the request. News of Wu's rebellion reached Beijing in January 1674.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court of the United States {{is split}} {{on whether a}} possessive {{singular}} noun that ends with s should always have an additional s after the apostrophe, sometimes have an additional s after the apostrophe (for instance, based on whether the final sound of the original word is pronounced /s/ or /z/), or never have an additional s after the apostrophe. The informal <b>majority</b> <b>view</b> (5–4, based on past writings of the justices) has favoured the additional s, but a strong minority disagrees.|$|E
5000|$|Justice Clarence Thomas {{filed an}} opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. He backed the <b>majority's</b> <b>view</b> on the {{unconstitutionality}} {{of the section}} 214(d) passport provision but claimed such Presidential powers over passports do not extend to consular reports. He wrote the [...] "regulation of these reports does not fall within the President's foreign affairs powers, but within Congress' enumerated powers under the Naturalization and Necessary and Proper Clauses." ...|$|R
2500|$|Souter {{underlined}} {{that government}} employees may often be in best positions {{to know the}} problems that exist in their employer agencies. Citing Givhan, Souter said that under the <b>majority’s</b> <b>view,</b> the English schoolteacher is protected when complaining to the principal about discriminatory hiring policy, as such policy {{is not part of}} the job description of the teacher; however, if a school personnel office made that same complaint, he or she would not be entitled to that same protection. [...] "This is an odd place to draw a distinction," [...] Souter noted, particularly because the <b>majority,</b> in his <b>view,</b> did not justify its choice of distinction.|$|R
50|$|Dissatisfaction with Chinese {{immigration}} {{grew and}} in 1885 a Royal Commission {{was appointed to}} obtain proof that restricting Chinese immigration {{would be in the}} best interests of the country. Prime Minister John A. McDonald originally refused to introduce prohibitive measures, but eventually yielded and appointed the commission. The commission was entitled Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration in 1885 and interviewed hundreds of people with the goal of understanding the <b>majority's</b> <b>view</b> on Chinese immigration.|$|R
25|$|The <b>majority</b> <b>view</b> among {{scholars}} is that Matthew was {{a product}} of {{the last quarter of the}} 1st century. This makes it a work of the second generation of Christians, for whom the defining event was the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple by the Romans in AD 70 in the course of the First Jewish–Roman War (AD 66–73); from this point on, what had begun with Jesus of Nazareth as a Jewish messianic movement became an increasingly Gentile phenomenon evolving in time into a separate religion.|$|E
25|$|The dissents of Holmes in Schwimmer, Hughes in Macintosh, and Black in In re Summers {{have since}} become the <b>majority</b> <b>view</b> of the Supreme Court. Schwimmer and Macintosh were {{overruled}} in Girouard v. United States, 328 U.S. 61 (1946). But {{even though the}} cases which {{formed the basis of}} the decision in In re Summers were disavowed, the Court reaffirmed Summers in 1950 in American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382 (1950). In re Summers became the basis for the Court to uphold a number of loyalty oath cases during the Cold War.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary Islamic Shafi`i jurists {{such as the}} Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa and fiqh scholar Taha Jabir Alalwani {{along with}} Shi'a jurists such as Grand Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri and Grand Ayatollah Hussein Esmaeel al-Sadr and some jurists, {{scholars}} and writers of other Islamic sects, have argued or issued fatwas that the changing of religion is not punishable, but these minority opinions have not found broad acceptance among the majority of Islamic scholars. However others have successfully argued that the <b>majority</b> <b>view,</b> in both {{the past and the}} present, wasn't a severe punishment for mere apostasy.|$|E
5000|$|The Court {{held the}} city of New Haven {{violated}} the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII by discarding the test scores. It said the city failed to establish any [...] "genuine dispute that the examinations were job-related and consistent with business necessity."

2500|$|Legal {{criticisms of}} the Roe {{decision}} address many points, among them are several suggesting {{that it is an}} overreach of judicial powers, or that it was not properly based on the Constitution, or that it is an example of judicial activism and that it should be overturned so that abortion law can be decided by legislatures. Justice Potter Stewart, who joined with the <b>majority,</b> <b>viewed</b> the Roe opinion as [...] "legislative" [...] and asked that more consideration be paid to state legislatures.|$|R
25|$|Around the mid-century, block-books, woodcut {{books with}} both text and images, usually {{carved in the}} same block, emerged as a cheaper {{alternative}} to manuscripts and books printed with movable type. These were all short heavily illustrated works, the bestsellers of the day, repeated in many different block-book versions: the Ars moriendi and the Biblia pauperum were the most common. There is still some controversy among scholars as to whether their introduction preceded or, the <b>majority</b> <b>view,</b> followed the introduction of movable type, with the range of estimated dates being between about 1440–1460.|$|E
25|$|Pennington was a {{candidate}} for Indiana's Lieutenant Governor in 1825, but he was defeated. During the campaign and {{as one of the}} most outspoken members of the Indiana General Assembly, Pennington opposed the state's massive plan for internal improvements, especially the construction of the Wabash and Erie Canal. He was among the nine legislators, which included James Whitcomb, who voted against the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act of 1836. He opposed the <b>majority</b> <b>view,</b> claiming their plans would have no direct benefits for his constituents and would only bankrupt the state. Pennington also argued that the arrival of railroads would quickly make plans for a statewide canal system obsolete. His predictions proved to be nearly correct.|$|E
25|$|Wealthy Loyalists wielded great {{influence}} in London and {{were successful in}} convincing the British that the <b>majority</b> <b>view</b> in the colonies was sympathetic toward the Crown. Consequently, British planners pinned {{the success of their}} strategies on popular uprisings of Loyalists, which never transpired on the scale required. Historians have estimated that Loyalists made up only 15–20% of the population (vs. 40-45% Patriots) and that they continued to deceive themselves on their level of support as late as 1780. The British discovered that any significant level of organized Loyalist activity would require the continued presence of British regulars, which presented them with a major dilemma. The manpower that the British had available was insufficient to both protect Loyalist territory and counter American advances. The vulnerability of Loyalist militias was repeatedly demonstrated in the South, where they suffered strings of defeats to their Patriot neighbors. The most crucial juncture of this was at Kings Mountain, and the victory of the Patriot partisans irreversibly crippled Loyalist military capability in the South.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the other}} delegates argued for unity and {{conformance}} with the <b>majority</b> <b>views,</b> he became increasingly outspoken. By October 12, {{as the debate}} continued he observed that [...] "Trade is important.... Wisdom is better than weapons of war. We don't mean to oppose Great Britain, merely for diversion; if it is necessary, that we make war, {{and that we have}} the means of it." [...] When pushed he declared that [...] "A republican government is little better than government of devils." ...|$|R

40|$|The case of Regent Taxi {{has given}} rise to {{considerable}} debate in the interpretation of the word « another» and whether it should be read restrictively or given a wide meaning. In a thorough analysis of the majority and minority opinions of the Supreme Court decision, an attempt has been made to circumscribe the positions adopted. Thereafter, an analysis of subsequent cases has been carried out to establish whether the <b>majority</b> <b>views</b> expressed by the Supreme Court have settled the debate definitely of whether the question remains unresolved...|$|R
