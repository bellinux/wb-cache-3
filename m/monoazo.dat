5000|$|Azo-dye based pigment (a {{brightly colored}} {{transparent}} or semitransparent dye {{with a white}} pigment) is used as the colorant in most modern paints requiring either a highly saturated yellow or simplicity of color mixing. The most common is the <b>monoazo</b> arylide yellow family, first marketed as Hansa Yellow.|$|E
50|$|Arylide yellow, {{also known}} as Hansa yellow and <b>monoazo</b> yellow, are a family of organic {{compounds}} used as pigments. They are primarily used as industrial colorants including plastics, building paints and inks. They are also used in artistic oil paints, acrylics and watercolors. These pigments are usually semi-transparent yellows and yellow-greens. Related organic pigments are the diarylide pigments. Overall, these pigments have partially displaced the toxic cadmium yellow in the marketplace. Painters such as Alexander Calder and Jackson Pollock {{are known to have}} employed arylide yellow in their artworks.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} <b>monoazo</b> {{disperse}} dyes {{have been prepared}} by coupling 2 -amino- 3 -carbethoxy- 4, 5 -dimethylthiophene with various N-arylmaleimides. The <b>monoazo</b> disperse dyes were characterised by IR spectral studies and elemental analysis. These dyes were applied at 2 % depth on polyester fabrics and gave light yellow to brown colour hues with fair fastness to light and very good to excellent fastness to washing, rubbing, perspiration and sublimation.

30|$|The results {{obtained}} {{enabled us to}} affirm that Gallizio in this work used traditional organic pigments, such as ultramarine blue, lithopone, and carbon black, as well as modern organic ones, such as <b>monoazo</b> PY 3 yellow pigment, PR 3 <b>monoazo</b> red pigment, and phthalocyanine blue PB 15. Pigments were applied by the artist using a PVAc binder on the canvases of the ceiling, while siccative oils and PVAc {{were found on the}} canvas of the wall. Wires, sand and traces of gunpowder were also observed, thus confirming Gallizio’s use of unconventional artists’ materials.|$|E

30|$|Also the “S”-shape {{spectrum}} of the dark yellow had an intense absorption band in the UV–vis region. In this case, however, the first derivative spectrum showed an intense maximum at 534  nm with a weak shoulder at 486  nm. These spectral features were possibly due {{to the presence of}} a mixture of a lead chromate yellow with a <b>monoazo</b> PY 3 pigment [22],[25]. This hypothesis was confirmed by the Raman {{spectrum of}} sample L 14 in which the bands of lead chromate (355 and 840  cm− 1), of calcite (451 and 988  cm− 1) and of <b>monoazo</b> PY 3 pigment (412, 622, 649, 747, 1035, 1140, 1188, 1275, 1310, 1338, 1387, 1566, 1600, 1615 and 1670  cm− 1) were easily detectable.|$|E

NMR and UV-visible absorption spectroscopic studies ' {{suggested that the}} azo tautomer content (::; 12 %), intramolecular hydrogen-bonding strength, and pKa (ca. 9. 9 - 10. 7), of each <b>monoazo</b> dye in water, increased with the increasing electron-donating ability of substituents on the phenyl ring. Contributions from the four tautomers of each bisazo dye to the overall composition were also found {{to depend on the}} electron-donating ability ofphenyl substituents. The intramolecular hydrogen-bonding strength and pKa (ca. 10. 4 - 11. 1) of the bisazo dyes were greater than for their <b>monoazo</b> ~ounterparts. None of the dyes aggregated significantly in water at ::; 1 x 10 - 3 mol dmÃ‚Â· 3, consistent with their extensive sulfonation. Dye reduction by a. -hydroxyalkyl radicals waS studied using time-resolved UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. The rate constant for electron transfer from radical to dye was similar for each dye (ca. 2 - 4 x 109 dm 3 morl SÃ‚Â·l). The radical anions formed by electron transfer disproportionated with rate constants of ca. 2 - 7 x 107 dm 3 morl SÃ‚Â·l for the <b>monoazo</b> dyes and one of the bisazo dyes, and ca. 6 x 108 dm 3 morl SÃ‚Â·l for the remaining bisazo dyes. The hydrazo compound formed by disproportionation ofthe bisazo dyes was observed to decay by two independent first-order processes. Product analysis studies using lH NMR spectroscopy, HPLC, and LC-MS suggested that dye reduction cleaves the N-N bond. Electrochemical studies ofthe dyes were consistent with the four-electron reduction of each hydrazone or azo group to yield aminated products. Product analysis studies suggested that electrochemical reduction of the azo group on one side of a bisazo dye occurred more readily than at the hydrazone group on the other, consistent with the products generated by reaction with photoinitiator radicals.

30|$|Gallizio used {{different}} pigments {{also for}} the yellow colours. The FORS spectra acquired in situ on different yellow areas showed different spectral features. The brilliant yellow of canvas A, for example, had an “S”-shape spectrum with an inflection point at 486  nm and an intense absorption band in the UV–vis region, due to a n(azo)[*]→[*]π* transition of a <b>monoazo</b> PY 3 yellow pigment [25].|$|E

40|$|The {{quinazoline}} skeleton is {{an important}} part of many alkaloids and has been isolated from some plants such as those obtained from the Rutacea family. The quinazoline moieties have been found to exhibit many pharmacological properties and such when used to prepare dyes could show some friendly influence on humans. In view of these, this study described the synthesis of <b>monoazo</b> dyes from 4 -amino- 2 -chloro- 6, 7 -dimethoxyquinazoline. The 4 -amino- 2 -chloro- 6, 7 -dimethoxyquinazoline was diazotized and coupled with arylamine and phenolic coupling compounds to afford six <b>monoazo</b> disperse dyes. The results of the absorption maxima of the dyes were found to depend on the substituents in the diazo and coupling components and varied from 370 nm to 517 nm and 704 nm in dimethylformamide (DMF). The dyes on polyester fabrics and acrylics fabrics showed good fastness to light and washing but excellent fastness to sublimation.

40|$|The intermolecular {{interaction}} occurring between {{bovine serum}} albumin and 4 -carboxyl- 2, 6 -dinitrophenylazohydroxynaphthalene in aqueous media {{has been studied}} spectrophotometrically at different temperatures including body temperature. Evidence {{for the formation of}} new molecular complexes was established by hypsochromic and hypochromic shifts of the spectra of dye-BSA complexes compared to the spectra of unbound dyes. One congener (AZ- 02) gave a minor peak characteristic of charge-transfer complexation. The binding constants of the four <b>monoazo</b> dyes were investigated and found to vary according to the dye structure and temperature of investigation. AZ- 01 and - 04 combined with BSA at approximately 1 : 1 mol ratio while the other two congeners with additional proton donors gave greater than this mole ratio. Thermodynamic considerations established that the dyes utilized the various forms of binding modes; hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic bonding, van der Waals and AZ- 03 was particularly involved in electrostatic interactions giving positive entropy change for a small enthalpy change. The observed properties were correlated with the genotoxicity potentials of the <b>monoazo</b> dyes.

40|$|A {{short-term}} in vivo genotoxicity {{evaluation of}} 4 -carboxyl- 2, 6 -dinitrophenylazohydronaphthalenes (AZ- 01 to AZ- 04) {{has been carried}} out in mice. Aqueous colloidal solutions of the dyes were administered to mice on each day for 5 successive days using gastric gavages. Two end point assessments of the genotoxicity potentials of the dyes were assessed using comet assay and chromosomal aberration studies using the mice bone marrow cells. The dyes were well tolerated at the doses investigated, as there were no deaths or any adverse pharmacotoxic events. Dose-dependent DNA damage (in terms of percentage of tail DNA and Olive tail moment) occurred with AZ- 01 and AZ- 02, although the effects were significant only with the highest doses. AZ- 03 gave similar patterns with those of AZ- 01 and AZ- 02, while replacement with butanone in AZ- 04 altered the observed pattern. Minimal chromosomal damages were obtained for the four dyes, with AZ- 01 and AZ- 02 giving nonsignificant damages, while the highest dose of AZ- 03 produced significant aberrations in terms of breaks. Some minor isochromatid breaks and gaps were also noticed in the dye-treated mice. Mitotic indices in all cases were not significantly different from concomitantly administered vehicle control showing lack of cytotoxicity of the <b>monoazo</b> dyes at these doses.
