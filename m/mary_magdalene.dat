Black thinks the girl is acting out, but Means reveals that she is reciting passages from the non-canonical Gnostic Gospels, which supposed that <b>Mary</b> <b>Magdalene</b> was the only disciple to fully understand the teachings of Jesus Christ. Means believes the girls are not seeing visions of Saint Mary, but of <b>Mary</b> <b>Magdalene.</b>|$|E

5|$|The date of Agrippinas first performance, {{about which}} there was at one time some uncertainty, has been {{confirmed}} by a manuscript newsletter as 26 December 1709.

5|$|The {{floor is}} of Jura marble, the altar, ambo, baptismal font and {{tabernacle}} {{are made of}} Lahn marble. The wall behind the altar held a neo-gothic crucifixion scene of Mary, John, and <b>Mary</b> <b>Magdalene</b> under the cross, from the Magdalenenkirche. Low stained glass windows forming the Stations of the Cross were designed by Paul Corazolla from Berlin. The first organ was built by E. F. Walcker & Cie. and consecrated in 1974.

5|$|The parish {{church of}} St. James is also {{located near the}} centre of Taunton quite close to St. <b>Mary</b> <b>Magdalene.</b> The oldest parts of St. James Church are early 14th-century, and there are {{fragments}} of 15th-century glass in the west end. Like St. Mary's {{it also has a}} sandstone tower but built to a much less impressive design. The tower was also, like St. Mary's, rebuilt in the 19th century– in this case thought to be due to building defects in the original tower. The church backs onto the County Ground and forms a familiar backdrop to the popular cricket ground.|$|E
5|$|Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladova, {{variously}} called Sonya and Sonechka, is {{the daughter}} of a drunkard named Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, whom Raskolnikov meets in a tavern {{at the beginning of the}} novel. She is often characterized as self-sacrificial, shy, and even innocent despite the fact that she is compelled into prostitution to help her family. She also, as Raskolnikov discerns, shares the same feelings of shame and alienation as he does and becomes the first person to whom Raskolnikov confesses his crime, and she supports him even though she was friends with one of the victims (Lizaveta). Throughout the novel, Sonya is an important source of moral strength and rehabilitation for Raskolnikov, and in some interpretations, even considered a Christ-like figure. She is forced to prostitute herself to provide for her family, leading some critics to make comparisons with <b>Mary</b> <b>Magdalene.</b>|$|E
