[...] He has attributed his deviations and infidelity to his losing track of Buddhism. He said, [...] "Buddhism teaches <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> following every impulse and to learn restraint.

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 2007, Sanz {{suffered}} a mental breakdown and took two months off {{in the middle of}} a world tour at the request of his doctor. The breakdown was caused by several events in his personal life, including the death of his father in 2005, his separation with Mexican model and actress Jaydy Mitchel, and his announcement that he had a three-year-old son outside of his marriage with Mitchel. He commented on the situation, saying [...] "You have to put things in perspective. It was stress, something that had never affected me, but this time, yes, it did. So I had to pay. A doctor told <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> for a couple of months to recuperate completely."

Professor Sohail Daulatzai views this labeling as significant, since it transforms Illmatic into [...] "a sonic map." [...] The album serves as the legend for Nas’s ghetto cartography, as he narrates his experiences and {{those who live in}} the Queensbridge” [...] In a 2009 interview with XXL, Nas discussed the purpose behind the album artwork among other promotional efforts, stating [...] "Really the record had to represent everything Nasir Jones is about from beginning to end, from my album cover to my videos. My record company had to beg <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> filmin' music videos in the projects. No matter what the song was about I had 'em out there.

Vang's lawyers commented that some of his abnormal remarks were due to the language barrier. Therefore, when Vang responded affirmatively to the question that Mr. Crotteau and Mr. Laski [...] "deserved to die," [...] his meaning implied that the men contributed to the circumstances that led to their deaths.|$|E

[...] Because he did not believe it to be true, Pincus claims, he did not report the story in The Washington Post until October 12, 2003: [...] "I wrote my October story because I did not think the person who spoke to me was committing a criminal act, but only practicing damage control by trying to get <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> writing about Wilson.

[...] Mike Love remembers Wilson comparing the song to Einstein's theory of relativity. Music journo David Dalton said that [...] "Brian studied it like an adept memorizing the Koran." [...] In July 1967, he visited Wilson at his home, later writing about a box of tapes he discovered in Wilson's bedroom: [...] "I assumed they were studio demos or reference tracks and threw one on the tape machine. It was the strangest thing ... All the tapes were of Brian talking into a tape recorder. Hour after hour of stoned ramblings on the meaning of life, color vibrations, fate, death, vegetarianism and Phil Spector." ...|$|E

Erickson blame Teneycke for the channel reporting during the 2011 federal election of a 16-year-old incident involving [...] Jack Layton being allegedly found in a massage parlour by police. [...] "There was no arrest, no criminal charge, therefore no criminal behaviour. On these facts, the justification of public interest was arguably thin," [...] according to Erickson, who claimed Sun News Network management nevertheless coached its on-air staff to treat the story as if it was [...] "a major sex scandal involving the NDP leader." [...] Erickson also claims that during the 2012 Alberta provincial election campaign, Teneycke [...] "instructed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> reporting on the homophobic gaffes of [...] Wildrose candidates" [...] and that Teneycke [...] "also demanded a segment discussing the Wildrose leader's record on abortion be removed from my program lineup".|$|E

[...] They both chatted for a few moments, then Nixon and his motorcade continued up Route 320, stopping in Swarthmore, the Springfield Shopping Center, Lawrence Park, Newtown Square, West Chester, before stopping in Paoli. Seven days later, Senator Kennedy appeared in Chester at Sixth and Penn Streets, drawing the largest ever crowd in the city, some 15,000 to 20,000. He continued to hammer away at the themes of America's lagging prestige abroad and lagging economy at home. [...] "I want the U.S. to meet its responsibilities at home and abroad and the U.S. to move forward", he told the crowds.

2500|$|However, in 1980, Deng Xiao Ping refocused his {{priorities}} {{back on the}} Chinese bureaucracy after his return to power in 1978. He welcomed Lee Kuan Yew, the then-Prime Minister of Singapore and its leading political figure since independence from Malaysia, in a visit to Beijing. [...] Chin recalled that Deng had not bothered to meet him since then. Finally in 1980, Deng summoned Chin. In the meeting, Deng demanded Chin to immediately close down all the CPM’s radio stations which were broadcasting from China to Malaysia. When Chin asked Deng when he would like him to cease the broadcasting, Deng replied, “The sooner the better... Lee (Lee Kuan Yew) asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the broadcasts immediately.” [...] Moreover, during his official visit to China, the second Prime Minister of Malaysian government Tun Razak held talks with Chinese communist leader Chairman Mao Zedong and urged him to stop giving aid to the CPM. The fourth Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohammad further succeeded in persuading China to downgrade its ties with the CPM. This was an important factor {{that contributed to the}} CPM’s decision to end its armed struggle.|$|E
2500|$|Byrd {{initially}} {{compiled a}} mixed {{record on the}} subjects of race relations and desegregation. [...] While he initially voted against civil rights legislation, in 1959 he hired one of the Capitol's first black congressional aides, and he also took steps to integrate the United States Capitol Police {{for the first time}} since Reconstruction. Beginning in the 1970s, Byrd explicitly renounced his earlier views favoring racial segregation. Byrd said that he regretted filibustering and voting against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and would change it if he had the opportunity. Byrd also said that his views changed dramatically after his teenage grandson was killed in a 1982 traffic accident, which put him in a deep emotional valley. [...] "The death of my grandson caused <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> and think," [...] said Byrd, adding he came to realize [...] that African-Americans love their children as much as he does his. [...] During debate in 1983 over the passage of the law creating the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday, Byrd grasped the symbolism of the day and its significance to his legacy, telling members of his staff [...] "I'm the only one in the Senate who must vote for this bill".|$|E
