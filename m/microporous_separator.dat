40|$|Non-aqueous {{electrolytes}} are stable over wide {{electrochemical potential}} windows, generally> 2 V, and therefore hold promise for enabling higher energy and power density redox flow batteries (RFBs). Nevertheless, {{the development of}} non-aqueous RFBs is {{at an early stage}} and significant research efforts are needed to demonstrate non-aqueous RFBs with performance characteristics that exceed those of aqueous RFBs. The membrane or separator is a critical component that to a great extent determines the performance of RFB systems for practical applications. In this work, the performance of a RFB was evaluated with Nafion 1035 membranes and Daramic 175 SLI microporous separators. The non-aqueous electrolyte was based on vanadium (III) acetylacetonate. This chemistry possesses two couples over ∼ 2. 2 V. Charge-discharge cycles were performed in a RFB at a current density of 10 mA cm− 2. Coulombic and energy efficiencies of 91 % and 80 % were achieved using the Nafion membrane. A similar RFB using the Daramic <b>microporous</b> <b>separator</b> achieved columbic and energy efficiencies of 73 % and 68 %, respectively. The source of capacity decay during multiple charge-discharge cycles was also investigated.

The results from membrane evaluation tests indicated that the cation-exchange Selemion CMV membrane (Asahi Glass Co., Japan) has the characteristics required for viable Vanadium redox cell performance, giving energy efficiency of over 80 % for a cell using activated FMI felt electrode. Even higher efficiencies of up to 88 % have been achieved with these materials [124]. Initial tests have also shown very promising results with the Daramic polyethylene <b>microporous</b> <b>separator</b> with a nominal thickness of 0. 16 mm. Due to the lower cost of microporous separators compared to ion exchange membranes, attempts were made to impart ion-selective capability to the Daramic microporous separators. Three different methods of treatments were tested and were found to be capable of imparting ion-selective characteristics to the microporous separators although further optimization of the treatment process is required. The problem of solvent transfer from one half-cell to the other half-cell during cycling of the Vanadium redox flow cell was investigated. It was found that by carefully adjusting the ionic strengths of the positive and negative electrolytes, the solvent transfer due to osmotic pressure effects can be minimized so that it is negligible during battery cycling.

40|$|Forthcoming flexible/wearable {{electronic}} devices with shape diversity and mobile usability garner {{a great deal}} of attention as an innovative technology to bring unprecedented changes in our daily lives. From the power source point of view, conventional rechargeable batteries (one representative example is a lithium-ion battery) with fixed shapes and sizes have intrinsic limitations in fulfilling design/performance requirements for the flexible/wearable electronics. Here, as a facile and efficient strategy to address this formidable challenge, we demonstrate a new class of printable solid-state batteries (referred to as "PRISS batteries"). Through simple stencil printing process (followed by ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking), solid-state composite electrolyte (SCE) layer and SCE matrix-embedded electrodes are consecutively printed on arbitrary objects of complex geometries, eventually leading to fully integrated, multilayer-structured PRESS batteries with various form factors far beyond those achievable by conventional battery technologies. Tuning rheological properties of SCE paste and electrode slurry toward thixotropic fluid characteristics, along with well-tailored core elements including UV-cured triacrylate polymer and high boiling point electrolyte, is a key-enabling technology for the realization of PRISS batteries. This process/material uniqueness allows us to remove extra processing steps (related to solvent drying and liquid-electrolyte injection) and also conventional <b>microporous</b> <b>separator</b> membranes, thereupon enabling the seamless integration of shape-conformable PRESS batteries (including letters-shaped ones) into complex-shaped objects.

40|$|The {{conventional}} design of PEM fuel cell stacks {{is based on}} a plate-and-frame in series architecture that evolved from Volta’s original concept of the zinc-air battery stack. The performance, durability and cost of the various PEM fuel cell stack components (membrane, electrodes, bipolar flow-field plates) in conjunction with the complex thermal and water management, are some of the major challenges hampering the larger scale adoption of this technology. Recently, we introduced an innovative Swiss-roll architecture for mixed-reactant fuel cells (MRFCs) both in monopolar and bipolar mode. The Swiss-roll MRFC (SR-MRFC) addresses some of the above-mentioned challenges of fuel cell technology by eliminating the need for ion exchange membranes and bipolar flow-field plates, while providing a lighter, more compact, cylindrical stack architecture [1, 2]. As shown in Fig. 1, in the Swiss-roll design, a flexible sandwich of electrodes and separators is rolled around an electronically conductive central axis to give a compact 3 D electrode space for the fuel cell reactions.

This study evaluated the chemical and electrochemical properties of the electrolytes and assessed experimental and commercial membranes {{for use in the}} V/Br flow cell. A number of techniques were employed to characterise the composition of the V/Br flow cell electrolytes. During charge, the conductivity of the positive half-cell electrolyte increased, whilst the density and viscosity increased. The reverse was observed for the negative half-cell. The UV-visible spectra of the electrolytes showed characteristic peak wavelengths of the vanadium oxidation states and provided and insight into the halogenated species forming during the operation of the V/Br flow cell. The electrochemical properties of the electrolytes were also examined using cyclic voltammetry. NMR studies examined the relationships between the 35 CI and 79 Br nuclei in the presence of halide and paramagnetic vanadium ions. It was established that the SOC and performance of the V/Br flow cell can be measured by changes in slllectral chemical shifts and line widths. Small-scale cycling experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of ion exchange membranes in the V/Br redox flow cell. Of the membranes evaluated, a number were not suitable for use due to high membrane resistances or low chemical stability. The perfluorinated Nafion® and Gore Select® ion exchange membranes proved to be the most chemically inert and showed low resistances. The Gore Select® membranes did however exhibit blistering during extended cycling.

30|$|Supercapacitors {{with high}} power levels due to long cycle life, short time of charge/discharge and low cost are very useful in {{applications}} such as transport and energy recovery. In many industries with fluctuating loads, supercapacitors have increasingly {{played the role of}} the stabilizer for the power supply and voltage [1]. Supercapacitors are suitable for energy harvesting systems that are used to power an integrated circuit [2]. A large application of supercapacitors is needed in the transport such as power emergency actuators in airliners (doors and evacuation slides) and high specific power in military vehicles (radar, power supplies for laser and airbag, radio communications, etc.) [3, 4]. Supercapacitors are commonly used in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) as a fuel reduction of brake energy due to a number of favorable properties [5]. These include fast charge, longer lifetime, stable electrical properties and broader temperature range. A flexible supercapacitor is necessary for both portable and wearable electronic during folding and twisting conditions. A supercapacitor is made of two electrodes, an electrolyte and a separator that due to charge storage method divided into pseudocapacitors, electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and hybrid supercapacitors. The mechanism of charge storage in EDLCs is based on the energy storage at the electrode/electrolyte interface and depends on the contact surface between the electrolyte and electrode. The electrodes of EDLCs are made using metal oxides, lithium ion materials and conducting polymers. But currently due to large surface areas, lightweight, electrochemical stability and excellent conductivity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), activated carbon and graphene are widely used [6, 7]. The mechanism of charge storage in pseudocapacitors is based on the Faradic reactions (oxidation–reduction reactions), store energy near the surface and within the bulk of the electrodes [8]. The electrodes of pseudocapacitors are made using transition metal oxides and conducting polymers along with their composites. The lifetime of Faradaic capacitors is shorter than EDLCs. Hybrid supercapacitors combine pseudocapacitors with EDLCs using asymmetric electrodes [9]. In hybrid supercapacitors, one electrode contains a material that conducts a pseudocapacitors mechanism and at the second electrode, charge separation occurs due to EDLCs formation. Supercapacitor based on the electrolyte divided into gel-state electrolytes, solid-state electrolytes, and liquid-state electrolytes. Supercapacitors based on solid-state prevent leakage. There is normally a poor contact between the electrode and the electrolyte. Leakage is also an important problem in liquid-state electrolytes. Therefore, during the development of supercapacitors, the gel-state electrolytes are commonly used [10, 11]. Recently, carbon nanomaterials because of conductivity and other excellent features could replace charge collectors in supercapacitors. The larger specific surface area (SSA) of CNTs (430 – 1600  m 2  g− 1) as an electrode in supercapacitor displays the higher specific capacitance. The specific capacitance of CNTs greatly depends on the purity and the morphology of the electrode surface material [12]. The specific capacitance of purified CNTs is in the range of 20 – 80  F g− 1 and can be increased by the oxidative process [13]. The results of paper supercapacitor analysis based on multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) electrodes and electrolyte by H 3 PO 4 and PVA has been reported by Shieh et al. [14]. They showed the specific capacitance was 47  F g− 1. In Ref. [15], a flexible paper based on single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) supercapacitor with H 3 PO 4 /PVA electrolyte has been investigated. In their study, the specific capacitance was reported as 115  F g− 1. In another study, the paper supercapacitor with SWCNTs/graphene composites has been studied by Li et al. [16]. They reported the specific capacitance for SWCNTs as 36  F g− 1 and that for composites film as 100  F g− 1. Ping et al. [17] compared the 2 D graphene paper and the 3 D graphene foam electrodes and showed the specific capacitances were 82.9 and 128  F g− 1, respectively. A high-performance supercapacitor based on the fine sandpaper-based electrodes and a <b>microporous</b> <b>separator</b> coated with a H 3 PO 4 /PVA gel electrolyte and graphene/MWCNTs electrode has been reported by Yu et al. [18]. They showed that at the voltage scan rate 20  mV s− 1, the specific capacitance of the sandpaper-based supercapacitor was 55  F g− 1. Activated carbon is widely used for electrodes in supercapacitors due to its SSA (1000 – 3500  m 2  g− 1) and low cost. In Ref. [19], the specific capacitance of supercapacitor based on activated carbon electrode for aqueous electrolyte and organic electrolyte has been reported. They reported the specific capacitance based on an activated carbon electrode for aqueous electrolyte and organic electrolyte as[*] < 200  F g− 1 and [*]< 100  F g− 1, respectively. Saha et al. [20] reported the specific capacitance of supercapacitor based on mesoporous carbon as 102  F g− 1. There are different methods to synthesize the mesoporous carbons such as high-degree activation and carbonization of precursors and aerogels [21]. Paper with low cost and environmentally friendly is a suitable substrate for the advance of a flexible supercapacitor [22]. In this study, the fabrication of paper supercapacitor based on GNPs electrodes and gel electrolyte has been investigated. The PVDF and PVA/H 3 PO 4 were used as a gel electrolyte. The PVA/water and BaTiO 3 were used as a gel separator film. The different layer of the paper supercapacitors using TEM and SEM analyses has been characterized as well. The electrical capacitance of the paper supercapacitors based on different gel electrolytes using CV and galvanostatic methods has been reported.

Both non-porous silicone and microporous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes provide detection limits in the parts per trillion (pptr) to parts per billion (ppb) range with a linear dynamic range of 3 orders of magnitude for some volatile organic compounds. A direct insertion membrane probe interfaced to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer is used to monitor on-line the concentration of reactants and products of photolysis (254 nm) of benzyl acetate and 3, 5 -dimethoxybenzyl acetate in water. The results are consistent with earlier experiments that the photolysis proceeds through both ion and neutral radical pair intermediates. ^ Thermochemical measurement by the kinetic method is performed on a pentaquadrupole mass spectrometer. Studies include the determination of ionization energies of organic compounds and stereoelectronic effects on cation affinities of pyridines. The ionization energy of 3 -iodobenzonitrile is determined as 9. 39 ± 0. 05 eV. The cations studied include SiCl 3 +, SiCl+, SF 3 +, Fe+, Co+, Ni+, FeC 5 H 5 +, CoC 5 H 5 + and NiC 5 H 5 +. Linear correlations between the logarithm of fragment ion abundance ratio and the proton affinities of the meta- and para-substituted pyridines are observed. Deviations from the linear correlations are observed in the cases of ortho-substituted pyridines. The deviations, the Sk values, are attributed to a combination of both steric and agostic effects. Agostic bonding is three-center two-electron bonding (M-H-L) in which the two electrons in the ligand L-H are formally donated to the metal center M. The Sk values for the cations are ordered and interpreted in terms of the stereoelectronic effects of the cation including the cation affinity, the size of the cation and the geometry of the cluster ion. ...|$|R
