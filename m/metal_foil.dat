Additionally, the aircraft was equipped with a simple cockpit voice recorder that recorded all conversations {{that took place in}} the cockpit of the aircraft. The flight recorder was recovered by investigators on Thursday, June 10, 1971, and sent to Washington D.C. for analysis. Though the voice recorder was also recovered, the thermal protective measures had failed and the recording tapes were destroyed by fire.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Ernest Rutherford, bombarded a <b>metal</b> <b>foil</b> with alpha particles to observe how they scattered. They expected all the alpha particles to pass straight through with little deflection, because Thomson's model said that the charges in the atom are so diffuse that their electric fields could not affect the alpha particles much. However, Geiger and Marsden spotted alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90°, which was supposed to be impossible according to Thomson's model. To explain this, Rutherford proposed that the positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus {{at the center of the}} atom. Rutherford compared his findings to one firing a 15-inch shell at a sheet of tissue paper and it coming back to hit the person who fired it.|$|E
5|$|In the Geiger–Marsden experiment, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden (colleagues of Rutherford {{working at}} his behest) shot alpha {{particles}} at thin sheets {{of metal and}} measured their deflection {{through the use of}} a fluorescent screen. Given the very small mass of the electrons, the high momentum of the alpha particles, and the low concentration of the positive charge of the plum pudding model, the experimenters expected all the alpha particles to pass through the <b>metal</b> <b>foil</b> without significant deflection. To their astonishment, a small fraction of the alpha particles experienced heavy deflection. Rutherford concluded that the positive charge of the atom must be concentrated in a very tiny volume to produce an electric field sufficiently intense to deflect the alpha particles so strongly.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} of the present work is to study the influence of sheet thickness on blank holding forceand limiting drawing ratio. Design/methodology/approach: Variation in blankholding force and limiting drawing ratio in deep drawing ofmetal foils were evaluated by calculation. Findings: The paper shows variation in the blankholding force required {{for the elimination of}} wrinkling and thelimiting drawing ratio with sheet thickness. The blankholding force required for the elimination of wrinklingincreased rapidly as the sheet thickness decreased. When the sheet thickness was very thin, the blankholdingforce was strongly influenced by the coefficient of friction. The limiting drawing ratio decreased as sheetthickness decreased and it decreased rapidly below 0. 04 mm thickness. When the sheet thickness was very thin,the limiting drawing ratio was strongly influenced by the coefficient of friction. Research limitations/implications: The control of the loading path of blankholding force will be an effectiveway to prevent the formation of defects including fractures and wrinkles in deep drawing of <b>metal</b> <b>foils.</b> Practical implications: When deep drawing of <b>metal</b> <b>foils</b> is carried out, the control of loading path of blankholdingforce during deep drawing operation can be very effective for improving the limiting drawing ratio.

New types of ceramic fibres usually are incorporated into a metal matrix by means of liquid infiltration or by hot pressing techniques.
