When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money I made that is going to be my legacy. It's how I played the game, and what I did on the field.|$|E
5|$|In August 2005, Glover {{was sentenced}} to 240 hours {{community}} service by St Helens magistrates after admitting claiming £14,831 in welfare benefits between August 2002 and November 2004 while posing for newspapers and magazines. She stated {{that she did not}} know the small and irregular earnings would <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> her benefits, and that she had been sometimes too depressed to leave her flat. While performing the community service in 2006, she was assaulted twice by a group of girls, one attack leaving her with a broken nose. This cost her a month of modelling work, and contributed to her depression, but also to her taking kickboxing classes to learn to defend herself.|$|E

25|$|Fergus and Mandy try to {{reassemble}} {{the broken}} {{pieces of the}} mirror. Fergus has {{the idea that if}} they put the pieces together on their side the mirror will repair itself on the other side. It works. While in the Hall of Mirrors, a kind woman appears to Daniel and Constance. She tells Constance she was right to steal the crown as the heir is dead. She also reveals that the crown can <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> the future. Meanwhile, in 1867 Gervais strikes gold, meaning he no longer has any need to sell the crown. The mirror appears and Constance goes through. Upon her return, Constance discovers that her father has entrusted the crown to her to do as she sees fit, but before she can arrange this with her friends in the 1990s, the mirror vanishes, signifying the end of their adventures. Back in 1997, Daniel, Fergus and Mandy visit Constance's grave and discover a clue to the location of the crown. Someone arrives and gives them a letter from Constance. The letter states that they are the new proprietors of the Crown Foundation. Now that their adventures had come to an end, Daniel decides to go back home and stay with this mum.|$|E
25|$|Incidents {{of police}} {{brutality}} seem to still be occurring at a consistent rate, however it {{is yet to be}} seen whether the trial of body cameras will <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> the number of incidents occurring or to the number of police who are prosecuted for misconduct. Additionally, there needs to be more work done by the government to break down negative social stereotypes that can lead to prejudice, racial profiling and the kind of aggressive hatred which is the driving force behind many instances {{of police brutality}} - the involvement of NGOs is valuable however the Austrian government needs to take a strong stance against abuse of power by police in order for real change to happen. One way to do this, as suggested by Amnesty International Austria, would be to disband the Bereitschaftspolizei, Vienna's riot police, as these officers have frequently been involved with human rights violations and situations of police brutality. Amnesty also suggest that Austria should adopt a National Action Plan against Racism (as is required by the 2001 Durban Declaration and Programme of Action) - something which they have previously refused to do. On a whole, Austria is moving slowly towards eradicating police brutality, however there needs to be much more done in order to ensure the rights of citizens are sufficiently protected.|$|E

It has therefore been proposed that there are non-commutative operators in the brain circuits that deal with rotations, including motor system circuits that steer the eyes, head and limbs, and sensory system circuits that handle spatial information. This idea is controversial: studies of eye and head control have revealed behaviours {{that are consistent with}} non-commutativity in the brain, but none that clearly rules out all commutative models.|$|R

[...] Although {{she had wanted to}} become a nurse, Hewson gave up on the notion, as the intense schooling required would have been incompatible with the direction that her husband's life had taken. [...] Instead she focused on studying in the social sciences, to give her an ability to understand social policy and <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> people, similar to what nursing would have enabled.

500|$|At {{some point}} Constable West spoke to Bamber {{again on the}} telephone; Bamber {{apparently}} complained {{about the time the}} police were taking, saying: [...] "When my father rang he sounded terrified." [...] He was told to go to the farm and wait for the police. Explaining why he had called a local police station and not 999, Bamber told police on the night that he had not thought it would <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> how soon they would arrive. He said he had spent time looking up the number, and even though his father had asked him to come quickly, he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London, then had driven slowly to the farmhouse. He acknowledged that he could have called one of the farm workers, but had not considered it. In his early witness statements, Bamber said he had telephoned the police immediately after receiving his father's call, then telephoned Mugford. During later police interviews, he said he had called Mugford first. He said he was confused about the sequence of events.|$|E

500|$|The type of soil would <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> {{the design}} of the motte, as clay soils could support a steeper motte, whilst sandier soils meant that a motte would need a more gentle incline. Where available, layers of {{different}} sorts of earth, such as clay, gravel and chalk, would be used alternatively to build in strength to the design. Layers of turf could also be added to stabilise the motte as it was built up, or a core of stones placed as the heart of the structure to provide strength. Similar issues applied to the defensive ditches, where designers found that the wider the ditch was dug, the deeper and steeper the sides of the scarp could be, making it more defensive. Although militarily a motte was, as Norman Pounds describes it, [...] "almost indestructible", they required frequent maintenance. Soil wash was a problem, particularly with steeper mounds, and mottes could be clad with wood or stone slabs to protect them. Over time, some mottes suffered from subsidence or damage from flooding, requiring repairs and stabilisation work.|$|E

2500|$|Continental Airlines is {{planning}} flight tests using aircraft powered by biofuel rather than traditional Jet-A1. On January 7, 2009, Continental partnered with GE Aviation {{to conduct a}} biofuel demonstration flight, making the airline the first U.S. carrier to conduct tests using biofuels. The test bed, a Boeing 737–800 (registered as N76516), ran one of its engines on a mix of 50% kerosene, 6% algae, and 44% jatropha, a weed that bears oil producing seeds. The engine running partly on biofuel burned 46kg less fuel than the conventional engine in 1 {{and a half hours}} while producing more thrust using the same volume of fuel. Continental's CEO, Larry Kellner, commented [...] "This is a good step forward, an opportunity to really <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> the environment" [...] citing jatropha's 50–60% lower CO2 emissions as opposed to Jet-A1 in its lifecycle.|$|E
