5|$|In Arroyo's 9-year administration, The economy {{experienced}} GDP {{growth from}} 4% in 2002 to 7% growth in 2007 with {{the completion of}} infrastructure projects like the LRT Line 2 in 2004 and <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the Great Recession. Nevertheless, it was tied with graft and political scandals like the Hello Garci scandal pertaining to the alleged manipulation of votes in the 2004 presidential elections. On November 23, 2009, the Maguindanao massacre led {{to the murder of}} 34 journalists.|$|E
5|$|The community's Finns {{organized}} a temperance society {{and built the}} Finnish Temperance Hall. The community also included a band, a volunteer fire department, tennis courts and a clubhouse for employees. A small Methodist church and Presbyterian church were built. The town also had a night watchman and later a full-time patrolman. Always noted as a quiet, orderly town, Elcor <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the social vagaries of adjacent communities, like Gilbert's red-light district.|$|E

5|$|Allardyce {{manage to}} sign another big {{name on a}} free {{transfer}} for the 2002–03 season, bringing in 28-year-old Nigeria captain Jay-Jay Okocha, who four years previously had been purchased by Paris Saint-Germain for £14million. He also brought in Spanish central defender Iván Campo on loan from Real Madrid. He sold 2001–02 top-scorer Michael Ricketts to Middlesbrough for £3.5million, bringing in Pierre-Yves André on loan as his replacement. Bolton struggled all season, but <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> relegation with a final day win over Middlesbrough.|$|E
5|$|By {{now in his}} mid thirties, {{first team}} {{opportunities}} became scarce for Gibbs in 2000–01. He made only seven first team appearances, although Watford <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> defeat in six of those. His final appearance, and only game under Gianluca Vialli, came on 24 April 2002. An 82nd-minute substitute, Gibbs was unable to prevent a late Gillingham goal, which secured them a 3–2 victory. Among Gillingham's players for Gibbs' professional swansong was Andy Hessenthaler, the man who became Watford captain after Gibbs' injury. Gibbs retired as Watford's second highest all-time appearance maker, although he started more matches than Luther Blissett, the man ahead of him.|$|E
5|$|Hispanics also {{fought for}} the Confederate States Navy. One such case was Captain Michael Philip Usina (1840 - 1903). Usina was born in St. Augustine, Florida, to Spanish parents. As Captain of several {{blockade}} runners, Usina <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> capture on his many successful missions. Usina fought in Co. B in the 8th Georgia Infantry of the Confederate Army before being transferred to the Navy. He was wounded and captured in the Battle of Manassas, but managed to escape and reach the Southern lines.|$|E

5|$|Richardson {{was serving}} on the Imperial General Staff in London as New Zealand's representative, having taken over Colonel Alfred Robin in this capacity, when the First World War broke out. He helped in the {{formation}} of the Royal Naval Division and deployed to France in September 1914 as its chief of staff, and then as assistant adjutant and quartermaster general with the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel. With the division, he served in the unsuccessful defence of Antwerp, and <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> being taken prisoner of war when the city fell to the Germans.|$|E
5|$|The SSSI is {{economically}} {{important to}} the area because of the tourists it attracts for birdwatching and other outdoor activities, although sensitive wildlife sites are <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> damage from {{the large numbers of}} visitors. Another threat is the encroachment of the sea on this soft coast. The Environment Agency considers that managed retreat {{is likely to be the}} long-term solution, and is working with the Norfolk Wildlife Trust to create new reserves inland to compensate for the loss of scarce habitats at the coast.|$|E
5|$|All {{that changed}} with the {{assassination}} of Tsar Alexander II. The mourning for the tsar meant {{there would be no}} performances in the capital; in addition the political climate of Russia turned sharply against the Jews. Goldfaden's troupe soldiered on for a time—to Minsk, to Bobruisk where they played mainly to Russian soldiers, and to Vitebsk, where he and Sonya ended up having to sue Goldfaden for their pay, and left to rejoin Rosenberg, who was playing in a tent theater in Nezhin. However, matters there proved even worse: Nezhin soon fell prey to a pogrom. The troupe <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> bodily harm, partly by convincing the rioters that they were a French theater troupe and partly by making judicious use of the money the Adlers had won in court from Goldfaden.|$|E

5|$|An {{exception}} {{to all of}} this would be the Primal Zerg, who inhabit the original Zerg homeworld of Zerus (as seen in Heart of the Swarm). The Zerg Hive Mind was created to control the Zerg, and eventually put them {{under the control of the}} main antagonist of the series, the fallen Xel'Naga Amon. Some Zerg, however, <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> being subsumed. These are the Primal Zerg, who have much the same genetic abilities but are not bound to the Overmind. These creatures are each independently sapient, and if they follow a leader it is because they choose to. Their lack of a Hive Mind also shields them from specific psionic attacks engineered to counter the Zerg Hive Mind.|$|E
5|$|County went undefeated in Gannon's {{first four}} league games in charge. After three weeks, this upturn in results saw Gannon offered the job full-time, which {{allowed him to}} guide County to safety. The club won {{more than twice as}} many points in the second half of the season than they did in the first. Believing that safety would be assured on the final day of the season, he was proved correct as they <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> relegation with a final day draw with champions Carlisle United. Comparisons were made to Sam Allardyce. As a {{committed}} Stockport fan, and already a legend at the club for his ten years as a player, he was loved by many County supporters. After delaying talks, he accepted a one-year rolling contract in the summer.|$|E
5|$|He {{administered}} for {{the king}} {{a large proportion of}} the vacant ecclesiastical offices. He personally managed sixteen abbeys or bishoprics. Eventually he obtained the wealthy see of Durham for himself in May 1099, being consecrated on 5 June 1099. He had been the custodian of the see since the death of the previous bishop in early 1096. At his consecration, he <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> giving a profession of obedience to Thomas the Archbishop of York, just as his predecessor had done. William of Malmesbury, a medieval chronicler, accused Ranulf of paying 1,000 pounds for the bishopric. He was given ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Carlisle and Cumbria, because his predecessors had done so as bishops of Lindisfarne, but he only exercised this for a short time, as after the accession of Henry I jurisdiction over these areas was transferred to the diocese of York.|$|E

5|$|Hoping {{to repeat}} {{the success of the}} earlier First Phase Campaign, the Chinese 13th Army first {{launched}} a series of surprise attacks along the Ch'ongch'on River Valley on the night of November 25, 1950, effectively destroying the Eighth United States Army's right flank while allowing Chinese forces to move rapidly into UN rear areas. In the subsequent battles and withdrawals during the period of November 26 to December 2, 1950, although the US Eighth Army <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> being surrounded by Chinese forces, the Chinese 13th Army were still able to inflict heavy losses onto the retreating UN forces which had lost all cohesion. In the aftermath of the battle, the US Eighth Army's heavy losses forced all UN forces to evacuate North Korea and to withdraw to the 38th parallel.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland, however, {{retained}} {{a degree of}} personal influence with George until his sudden death in 1722 allowed the rise of Sir Robert Walpole. Walpole became de facto Prime Minister, although the title was not formally applied to him (officially, he was First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer). His management of the South Sea crisis, by rescheduling the debts and arranging some compensation, helped the return to financial stability. Through Walpole's skilful management of Parliament, George <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> direct implication in the Company's fraudulent actions. Claims that George had received free stock as a bribe are not supported by evidence; indeed receipts in the Royal Archives show that he paid for his subscriptions and that he lost money in the crash.|$|E
5|$|The {{work of the}} CNSA {{during the}} war was {{considered}} extremely successful by contemporaries and modern historians alike. By providing a network of food distribution, the CNSA and CRB <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> a major famine in Belgium during the occupation. Nevertheless, although the CRB and CNSA {{were part of the}} same network, the CRB criticized the CNSA, holding it responsible for occasional thefts of food by the Germans and for providing inadequate security for the shipments. The Belgian arm, however, felt under undue pressure from the CRB. In 1916, Francqui even petitioned the British to allow the CNSA to take full charge of the international network away from the CRB, although this appeal was dismissed because of the precarious position CNSA held within the occupied country. Nevertheless, relations between the two bodies remained generally good.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{seeing the}} Unity approaching, Moore opened full sail and cut away his boats {{in an attempt}} to escape. As the Unity pulled closer, Moore opened fire. The Unity crew <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> damage and pulled {{alongside}} the Margaretta. Led by Joseph Getchell and O'Brien's brother, John, the Unity crew stormed on board. Both sides exchanged musket shots as Moore tossed hand grenades onto the Unity. Moore was taken down by Samuel Watts with a musket shot to the chest. Once the Falmouth Packet caught up to the attack, it managed to pull along the other side of Moore's ship. With the combination of both crews, they were able to overwhelm the Margaretta.|$|E
5|$|When Bishop Lyfing died in 1046, {{the king}} made Leofric Bishop of Cornwall {{as well as}} Bishop of Crediton. The two sees, or bishoprics, held by Lyfing became the see of Exeter in 1050 when Bishop Leofric moved his episcopal seat from Crediton to Exeter and {{combined}} it with Cornwall. The move of the see received the support of Pope Leo IX, and dates from 1051. Although Leofric had been a royal clerk before he became bishop, after his elevation he <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> entanglement in the various disputes taking place between the king and Godwin, Earl of Wessex. Instead he spent his energies on the administration of his diocese, but remained on good terms with the king. Leofric's penitential, the Leofric Missal, still survives, and it includes a prayer for a childless king, which probably referred to King Edward.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bombers}} worked over the airfield, Aircraftman D. Roberts waited {{for them on}} the {{northern}} boundary with his parachute-and-cable launchers. Three Do 17s were heading towards him, climbing slowly. When they were in range he fired the cables. Nine rockets flew upwards. Wilhelm Raab saw the rockets go up. Although {{he did not understand}} what they were, he banked the Do 17 to avoid the lines of smoke {{that may or may not}} have concealed something. Because the Dornier banked, one of the cables that hit his bomber slid off the wing before the lower parachute had time to deploy. Pilot Petersen's Dornier was not that lucky. Already on fire it ran into the cable which dragged it out of the sky. The Do 17 crashed killing all five crewmen. Oberleutnant Rudolf Lamberty (carrying Joachim Roth) also <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> a collision, but before he could do so fire hit his Dornier destroying the fuel tanks. The bomber caught fire and he was barely able to keep control. Eventually it crash-landed at Leaves Green in Kent after being shot down by No. 111 Squadron Hurricanes. Roth was killed, but Lamberty survived with burns.|$|E
