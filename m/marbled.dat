5|$|<b>Marbled</b> newts {{owe their}} name to their green–black, <b>marbled</b> colour pattern. In females, an orange-red line runs down back and tail. The crest of male <b>marbled</b> newts is smaller and fleshier {{than that of}} the crested newts and not indented, but <b>marbled</b> newt males also have a whitish tail band at {{breeding}} time.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, {{the genus}} {{contains}} nine accepted species. There are seven species of crested newts: Anatolian crested newt (Triturus anatolicus), Balkan crested newt (T. ivanbureschi), Danube crested newt (T. dobrogicus), Italian crested newt (T. carnifex), Macedonian crested newt (T. macedonicus), northern crested newt (T. cristatus), and southern crested newt (T. karelinii). <b>Marbled</b> newts have two species, the <b>marbled</b> newt (T. marmoratus) {{and the southern}} <b>marbled</b> newt (T. pygmaeus).|$|E
5|$|A 24-million-year-old fossil {{belonging}} to Triturus, perhaps a <b>marbled</b> newt, {{shows that the}} genus already existed {{at that time and}} contradicts the earlier estimate of 8.3 million years ago (mya) for the split between the crested and <b>marbled</b> newts and their sister genus, the European brook newts (Calotriton). An age calibration study based on this and other fossils places that divergence much earlier, at around 39 mya in the Eocene, with an uncertainty range of 47 to 34 mya. Based on this estimation, authors have investigated diversification within the genus and related it to paleogeography: The crested and <b>marbled</b> newts split between 30 and 24 mya, and the two species of <b>marbled</b> newts have been separated for 4.7–6.8 million years.|$|E
5|$|Not to be {{confused}} with Torpedo sinuspersici, also known as the <b>marbled</b> electric ray.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Torpedo, the <b>marbled</b> {{electric}} ray {{belongs to the}} subgenus Torpedo, which differs from the other subgenus Tetronarce in having fringed margins on their spiracles and generally ornate dorsal coloration. Other common names for this species include common crampfish, <b>marbled</b> torpedo, numbfish, and spotted torpedo.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} obvious colour {{differences}} between crested and <b>marbled</b> newts, {{species in the}} genus also have different body forms. They range from stocky with sturdy limbs in the Anatolian, Balkan and the southern crested newt {{as well as the}} <b>marbled</b> newts, to very slender with short legs in the Danube crested newt. These types were first noted by herpetologist Willy Wolterstorff, who used the ratio of forelimb length to distance between fore- and hindlimbs to distinguish subspecies of the crested newt (now full species); this index however sometimes leads to misidentifications. The number of rib-bearing vertebrae in the skeleton was shown to be a better species indicator. It ranges from 12 in the <b>marbled</b> newts to 16–17 in the Danube crested newt and is usually observed through radiography on dead or sedated specimens.|$|E
5|$|At {{the onset}} of the Quaternary glacial cycles, around 2.6 mya, the extant Triturus species had already emerged. They were thus {{affected}} by the cycles of expansion and retreat of cold, inhospitable regions, which shaped their distribution. A study using environmental niche modelling and phylogeography showed that during the Last Glacial Maximum, around 21,000 years ago, crested and <b>marbled</b> newts likely survived in warmer refugia mainly in southern Europe. From there, they recolonised the northern parts after glacial retreat. The study also showed that species range boundaries shifted, with some species replacing others during recolonisation, for example the southern <b>marbled</b> newt which expanded northwards and replaced the <b>marbled</b> newt. Today's most widespread species, the northern crested newt, was likely confined to a small refugial region in the Carpathian Basin during the last glaciation, and from there expanded its range north-, east- and westwards when the climate rewarmed.|$|E
5|$|Belted Galloways are {{primarily}} raised for their quality <b>marbled</b> beef, {{although they are}} sometimes milked and purchased to adorn pastures due to their striking appearance.|$|E
5|$|Crested and <b>marbled</b> newts {{are found}} in Eurasia, from Great Britain and the Iberian Peninsula {{in the west to}} West Siberia and the {{southern}} Caspian Sea region in the east, and reach north to central Fennoscandia. Overall, the species have contiguous, parapatric ranges; only the northern crested newt and the <b>marbled</b> newt occur sympatrically in western France, and the southern crested newt has a disjunct, allopatric distribution in Crimea, the Caucasus, and south of the Caspian Sea.|$|E
5|$|Other Triturus species only meet at narrow zones {{on their}} range borders. Hybridisation does occur {{in several of}} these contact zones, as shown by genetic data and {{intermediate}} forms, but is rare, supporting overall reproductive isolation. Backcrossing and introgression do however occur as shown by mitochondrial DNA analysis. In {{a case study in}} the Netherlands, genes of the introduced Italian crested newt were found to introgress into the gene pool of the native northern crested newt. The two <b>marbled</b> newt species can be found in proximity in a narrow area in central Portugal and Spain, but they usually breed in separate ponds, and individuals in that area could be clearly identified as one of the two species. Nevertheless, there is introgression, occurring in both directions at some parts of the contact zone, and only {{in the direction of the}} southern <b>marbled</b> newt where that species had historically replaced the <b>marbled</b> newt (see also above, Glacial refugia and recolonisation).|$|E
5|$|A complex courting ritual {{performed}} underwater characterises the crested and <b>marbled</b> newts. Males are territorial and use leks, or courtship arenas, small {{patches of}} clear ground where they display and attract females. When they encounter other males, {{they use the}} same postures as described below for courting to impress their counterpart. Occasionally, they even bite each other; <b>marbled</b> newts seem more aggressive than crested newts. Males also frequently disturb the courting of other males and try to guide the female away from their rival. Pheromones are used to attract females, and once a male has found one he will pursue her and position {{himself in front of}} her. After this first orientation phase, courtship proceeds with display and spermatophore transfer.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} typical colouration, Djungarian hamsters {{can also be}} {{coloured}} pearl, sapphire, sapphire pearl, and <b>marbled.</b> Other colorations are available, but these are strongly suspected to appear only in hybrid crossings with Campbell's dwarf hamsters. Some of these colorations are mandarin, blue, argente, yellow blue fawn, camel, brown, cream, merle, and umbrous.|$|E
5|$|In European Salamandridae, {{albinism}} {{has been}} recorded in the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra), gold-striped salamander (Chioglossa lusitanica), Italian crested newt (Triturus carnifex), <b>marbled</b> newt (Triturus marmoratus), Iberian ribbed newt (Pleurodeles waltl), alpine newt (Ichthyosaura alpestris) and two sub-species of the smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris vulgaris and Lissotriton vulgaris meridionalis).|$|E
5|$|Known parasites of the <b>marbled</b> {{electric}} ray include the tapeworms Anthocephalum gracile and Calyptrobothrium riggii, the leeches Pontobdella muricata and Trachelobdella lubrica, the monogeneans Amphibdella torpedinis, Amphibdelloides kechemiraen, A. maccallumi, A. vallei, Empruthotrema raiae, E. torpedinis, and Squalonchocotyle torpedinis, and the nematodes Ascaris torpedinis and Mawsonascaris pastinacae.|$|E
5|$|The {{electric}} shock delivered by a <b>marbled</b> electric ray can be severe {{but is not}} directly life-threatening. Its electrogenic properties have been known since classical antiquity, when live rays were used to treat conditions such as chronic headaches. This and other electric ray species are used as model organisms in biomedical research. Various coastal demersal fisheries take the <b>marbled</b> electric ray as bycatch; captured rays are usually discarded as they have little commercial value. The impact of fishing on its population is uncertain, and thus International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this ray under Data Deficient. In the Mediterranean Sea, it remains the most common electric ray and in some areas may be increasing in number.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{immediately}} threatened, crested and <b>marbled</b> newts suffer from population declines, caused mainly by habitat loss and fragmentation. Both their aquatic breeding sites and the cover-rich, natural landscapes upon which they depend during their terrestrial phase are affected. All species are legally protected in Europe, {{and some of}} their habitats have been designated as special reserves.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling in nature, the <b>marbled</b> {{electric}} ray inhabits rocky reefs and seagrass beds, {{as well as}} nearby areas with sandy or muddy bottoms. During warm summer months, pregnant females are known to migrate into Arcachon Bay in northwestern France, where they are commonly found in very shallow, muddy pools near oyster beds. This species may conduct a northward migration in summer and autumn, into {{the waters of the}} British Isles.|$|E
5|$|During their {{terrestrial}} phase, crested and <b>marbled</b> newts {{depend on}} a landscape that offers cover, invertebrate prey and humidity. The precise requirements of most species are still poorly known, as the newts are {{much more difficult to}} detect and observe on land. Deciduous woodlands or groves are in general preferred, but conifer woods are also accepted, especially in the far northern and southern ranges. The southern <b>marbled</b> newt is typically found in Mediterranean oak forests. In the absence of forests, other cover-rich habitats, as for example hedgerows, scrub, swampy meadows, or quarries, can be inhabited. Within such habitats, the newts use hiding places such as logs, bark, planks, stone walls, or small mammal burrows; several individuals may occupy such refuges at the same time. Since the newts in general stay very close to their aquatic breeding sites, the quality of the surrounding terrestrial habitat largely determines whether an otherwise suitable water body will be colonised.|$|E
5|$|Historically, most European newts were {{included}} in the genus, but taxonomists have split off the alpine newts (Ichthyosaura), the small-bodied newts (Lissotriton) and the banded newts (Ommatotriton) as separate genera. The closest relatives of Triturus are the European brook newts (Calotriton). Two species of <b>marbled</b> newts and seven species of crested newts are accepted, of which the Anatolian crested newt was only described in 2016. Their ranges are largely contiguous but where they do overlap, hybridisation may take place.|$|E
5|$|Rare vagrant species {{spotted in}} the area include lesser yellowlegs, white-rumped sandpiper, Pallid Harrier (in spring) and Richard's pipit (in autumn). The birds seen on Brean Down include {{peregrine}} falcon, jackdaw, kestrel, collared and stock doves, whitethroat, linnet, stonechat, dunnock and rock pipit. There are also several species of butterfly, including chalkhill blue, dark green fritillary, meadow brown, <b>marbled</b> white, small heath, and common blue.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and slow-moving, the <b>marbled</b> {{electric}} ray may remain motionless {{for several days}} at a time. It is more active at night and spends {{much of the day}} buried in sediment with only the eyes and spiracles showing. Consistent with its sluggish nature, the <b>marbled</b> {{electric ray}} has a low blood oxygen carrying capacity and heart rate (10–15 beats/min), and consumes less oxygen than other sharks and rays of similar size. It is highly tolerant of being deprived of oxygen (hypoxia), allowing it to cope with deoxygenated bottom waters or being stranded in small pools by the falling tide. The ray stops breathing entirely when the oxygen partial pressure in the water drops below 10–15 Torr, and can survive such a state for at least five hours. It deals with extreme hypoxia by coupling anaerobic glycolysis to additional energy-producing pathways in its mitochondria, which serves to slow down the accumulation of potentially harmful lactate within its cells.|$|E
5|$|The birds seen on Brean Down include {{peregrine}} falcon, jackdaw, kestrel, collared {{and stock}} doves, common whitethroat, common linnet, stonechat, dunnock, rock pipit and– in 2007 – Britain's {{first and only}} Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross. There are also several species of butterfly, including chalkhill blue, dark green fritillary, meadow brown, <b>marbled</b> white, small heath, and common blue.|$|E
5|$|The <b>marbled</b> {{electric}} ray is an ambush predator that employs electricity to capture prey. Vision {{is of little}} importance in hunting, as the ray's eyes are often obscured as it lies buried on the bottom. Instead, it likely relies on the mechanoreceptors of its lateral line, as it only attacks moving prey. The electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini may also contribute to prey detection.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{crested newt}} and the <b>marbled</b> newt {{are the only}} species in the genus with a considerable range overlap (in western France). In that area, they have patchy, mosaic-like distributions and in general prefer different habitats. When they do occur in the same breeding ponds, they can form hybrids, which have intermediate characteristics. Individuals resulting from the cross of a crested newt male with a <b>marbled</b> newt female had mistakenly been described as distinct species Triton blasii de l'Isle 1862, and the reverse hybrids as Triton trouessarti Peracca 1886. The first type is much rarer due to increased mortality of the larvae and consists only of males, while in the second, males have lower survival rates than females. Overall, viability is reduced in these hybrids and they rarely backcross with their parent species. Hybrids made up 3–7% of the adult populations in different studies.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{crested newt}} {{is the most}} widespread species, while the others are confined to smaller regions, e.g. the southwestern Iberian Peninsula in the southern <b>marbled</b> newt, and the Danube basin {{and some of its}} tributaries in the Danube crested newt. The Italian crested newt (T. carnifex) has been introduced outside its native range in some European countries and the Azores. In the northern Balkans, four species of crested newt occur in close vicinity, and may sometimes even co-exist.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{delivered}} by the <b>marbled</b> electric ray can be painful but is seldom life-threatening, {{although there is a}} danger of a shocked diver becoming disoriented underwater. Its electrogenic properties have been known since classical antiquity, leading it and other electric fishes to be used in medicine. The ancient Greeks and Romans applied live rays to those afflicted with conditions such as chronic headaches and gout, and recommended that its meat be eaten by epileptics.|$|E
5|$|The two <b>marbled</b> newts {{are readily}} {{distinguished}} by size and colouration. In contrast, separating crested newt species based on appearance is not straightforward, but most {{can be determined}} {{by a combination of}} body form, coloration, and male crest shape. The Anatolian, Balkan, and southern crested newt however are cryptic, morphologically indistinguishable species. Triturus newts occupy distinct geographical regions (see Distribution), but hybrid forms occur at range borders between some species and have intermediate characteristics (see Hybridisation and introgression).|$|E
5|$|Crested and <b>marbled</b> newts {{live and}} breed in vegetation-rich ponds or similar aquatic {{habitats}} {{for two to}} six months and usually {{spend the rest of}} the year in shady, protection-rich land habitats close to their breeding sites. Males court females with a ritualised display, ending in the deposition of a spermatophore that is picked up by the female. After fertilisation, a female lays 200–400 eggs, folding them individually into leaves of water plants. Larvae develop over two to four months before metamorphosing into land-dwelling juveniles.|$|E
5|$|Molecular phylogenetic data helped clarify {{relationships}} within the genus Triturus. A 2011 phylogeny based on complete mitochondrial DNA resolved all divergences with high statistical support. The crested and the <b>marbled</b> newts are sister groups, {{and within the}} crested newts, the Balkan–Asian group with T. anatolicus, T. karelinii and T. ivanbureschi is sister to the remaining species, results consistent with other studies. The mitochondrial analysis also supports the northern (T. cristatus) and the Danube crested newt (T. dobrogicus), {{as well as the}} Italian (T. carnifex) and the Macedonian crested newt (T. macedonicus), respectively, as sister species, but analysis of nuclear DNA gave some conflicting results regarding those divergences.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod {{are white}} to cream on their ventral (belly) surfaces. Their backs and flanks are usually yellowish-green to green, overlain with heavy darker green, but {{occasionally}} brown or black, mottling. The {{effect is a}} <b>marbled</b> appearance sometimes reminiscent of a leopard's markings. Colouration is related to water clarity; colouration is intense in fish from clear water habitats. Small to medium-sized Murray cod from clear-water habitats often have striking and very distinct colouration. Very large fish tend towards a speckled grey-green colouration.|$|E
5|$|The <b>marbled</b> {{electric}} ray exhibits aplacental viviparity, {{in which the}} developing embryos are nourished initially by yolk, which is later supplemented by nutrient-rich histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Adult females have two functional ovaries and uteruses; the inner lining of the uterus bears a series of parallel lengthwise folds. The reproductive cycle for females is probably biennial, while males are capable of mating every year. Mating occurs from November to January, and the young are born the following year after a gestation period of 9–12 months. The litter size ranges from 3 to 32, increasing {{with the size of}} the female.|$|E
5|$|The <b>marbled</b> {{electric}} ray is caught incidentally in bottom trawls, trammel nets, and bottom longlines; {{it has little}} economic value and is mostly discarded at sea when captured. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough population and fishery data to assess its conservation status beyond Data Deficient. At least in the northern Mediterranean, surveys have found that it remains the most common {{electric ray}}, and is perhaps becoming more abundant in Italian waters. This and other electric ray species are used as model organisms in biomedical research because their electric organs are rich in acetylcholine receptors, which {{play an important role}} in the human nervous system.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} reception {{rooms are}} on the ground floor with large sash windows opening immediately into the porticos and the colonnades, and therefore onto the gardens, a situation unheard of in the grand villas and palaces of Renaissance Italy. The mansion contains a series of 18th century salons decorated and furnished in the style of that period, with polychrome marble floors, and painted ceilings depicting classical scenes of Greek and Roman mythology. Of particular note is the entrance hall, which resembles a Roman atrium with <b>marbled</b> columns and a painted ceiling copied from Robert Wood's Ruins of Palmyra.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} local nature {{reserves}} {{in and around}} Taunton, which are protected under a statutory designation in Section 21 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. South Taunton Streams is an urban wetland, and in the northern suburbs is the Children's Wood riverside reserve which provides a movement corridor for animals including otters {{along the banks of}} the River Tone. Birds occurring at the site include: kingfisher, dipper, grey wagtail, mute swan, grey heron and reed warbler. It is also home to butterflies such as the small and large skipper, <b>marbled</b> white, small heath and small copper, and to dragonflies and damselflies.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its size}} and {{electrical}} defenses, the <b>marbled</b> electric ray does not often fall prey to other animals such as sharks. This species exhibits different defensive behaviors depending on whether a prospective predator grasps it by the disc or the tail. A ray touched on the disc will quickly turn toward the threat while producing electric shocks; {{this is followed by}} it fleeing in a straight line, after which it may re-bury itself. A ray touched on the tail will propel itself upward into a loop; if it has not escaped after the maneuver, the ray will curl into a ring with the belly facing outward, so as to present the area of its body with the highest electric field gradient (the underside of the electric organs) towards the threat; these behaviors are accompanied by short, strong electric shocks. The ray tends to produce more electric bursts when protecting its tail than when protecting its disc.|$|E
5|$|Limousins {{have become}} popular {{because of their}} low birth weights (ease of calving), higher than average {{dressing}} percentage (ratio of carcase to live weight) and yield (ratio of meat to carcase), high feed conversion efficiency, {{and their ability to}} produce lean, tender meat. A major multi-breed study reported that Limousins converted feed into saleable meat more efficiently and significantly faster than popular British breeds, and marginally faster than other popular continental European cattle breeds. Conversely, the other cattle breeds produced proportionally more low-cost by-product and waste, which resulted in their live weight growth being faster than Limousins. Limousins are especially favoured for crossbreeding with cattle such as Angus, Hereford and Shorthorn because of their ability to contribute hybrid vigour, and improve the yield and feed conversion efficiency of these British breeds, which produce higher levels of fat and <b>marbled</b> meat.|$|E
