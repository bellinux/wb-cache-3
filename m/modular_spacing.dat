Metric <b>modular</b> <b>spaces</b> are extensions of metric spaces, metric linear <b>spaces,</b> and classical <b>modular</b> linear <b>spaces.</b> The topics covered include the classification of modulars, metrizability of <b>modular</b> <b>spaces,</b> <b>modular</b> transforms and duality between <b>modular</b> <b>spaces,</b> metric  and <b>modular</b> topologies. Applications illustrated in this book include: the description of superposition operators acting in <b>modular</b> <b>spaces,</b> the existence of regular selections of set-valued mappings, new interpretations of spaces of Lipschitzian and absolutely continuous mappings, the existence of solutions to ordinary differential equations in Banach spaces with rapidly varying right-hand sides. ...|$|R
