25|$|The {{chemistry}} of the <b>make-up</b> <b>water,</b> including {{the amount of}} dissolved minerals, can vary widely. Make-up waters low in dissolved minerals such as those from surface water supplies (lakes, rivers etc.) tend to be aggressive to metals (corrosive). Make-up waters from ground water supplies (such as wells) are usually higher in minerals, and tend to be scaling (deposit minerals). Increasing the amount of minerals present in the water by cycling can make water less aggressive to piping; however, excessive levels of minerals can cause scaling problems.|$|E
25|$|On 17 March, Unit 6 was {{reported}} to have a single operational air-cooled diesel-generator as well as dry switchgear (inside the only GE Mark II reactor building) and this was to be used to power pumps in Unit 5 to run the <b>Make-up</b> <b>Water</b> Condensate System (MUWC) to supply more water. Preparations were made to inject water into the reactor pressure vessel once external power could be restored to the plant, as water levels in the reactors were considered to be declining. NISA reported that connections from the grid to all units was complete 20 March through new cables and transformers.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{there is}} {{continuous}} withdrawal of steam and continuous {{return of condensate}} to the boiler, losses due to blowdown and leakages {{have to be made}} up to maintain a desired water level in the boiler steam drum. For this, continuous <b>make-up</b> <b>water</b> is added to the boiler water system. Impurities in the raw water input to the plant generally consist of calcium and magnesium salts which impart hardness to the water. Hardness in the <b>make-up</b> <b>water</b> to the boiler will form deposits on the tube water surfaces which will lead to overheating and failure of the tubes. Thus, the salts have to be removed from the water, and that is done by a water demineralising treatment plant (DM). A DM plant generally consists of cation, anion, and mixed bed exchangers. [...] Any ions in the final water from this process consist essentially of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions, which recombine to form pure water. Very pure DM water becomes highly corrosive once it absorbs oxygen from the atmosphere because of its very high affinity for oxygen.|$|E

He estimated that only 22 US gallons (83 liters) of water {{were required to}} travel from Los Angeles to New York. Furthermore, Meyer claimed to have replaced the spark plugs with [...] "injectors" [...] that introduced a hydrogen/oxygen mixture into the engine cylinders. The water was subjected to an electrical resonance that dissociated it into its basic atomic <b>make-up.</b> The <b>water</b> fuel cell would split the water into hydrogen and oxygen gas, which would then be combusted back into water vapor in a conventional internal combustion engine to produce net energy.|$|R
25|$|Crystallization {{and washing}} of {{melamine}} generates {{a considerable amount}} of waste water, which is a pollutant if discharged directly into the environment. The waste water may be concentrated into a solid (1.5–5% of the weight) for easier disposal. The solid may contain approximately 70% melamine, 23% oxytriazines (ammeline, ammelide, and cyanuric acid), 0.7% polycondensates (melem, melam, and melon). In the Eurotecnica process, however, there is no solid waste and the contaminants are decomposed to ammonia and carbon dioxide and sent as off gas to the upstream urea plant; accordingly, the waste water can be recycled to the melamine plant itself or used as clean cooling <b>water</b> <b>make-up.</b>|$|R
50|$|A common {{application}} of this principle is in systems which have an exhaust stream or waste stream which is transferred from the system to its surroundings. Some of the energy in that flow of material (often gaseous or liquid) may {{be transferred to the}} make-up or input material flow. This input mass flow often comes from the system's surroundings, which, being at ambient conditions, are at a lower temperature than the waste stream. This temperature differential allows heat transfer and thus energy transfer, or in this case, recovery. Thermal energy is often recovered from liquid or gaseous waste streams to fresh <b>make-up</b> air and <b>water</b> intakes in buildings, such as for the HVAC systems, or process systems.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the cycles}} of {{concentration}} increase, the water {{may not be able}} to hold the minerals in solution. When the solubility of these minerals have been exceeded they can precipitate out as mineral solids and cause fouling and heat exchange problems in the cooling tower or the heat exchangers. The temperatures of the recirculating water, piping and heat exchange surfaces determine if and where minerals will precipitate from the recirculating water. [...] Often a professional water treatment consultant will evaluate the <b>make-up</b> <b>water</b> and the operating conditions of the cooling tower and recommend an appropriate range for {{the cycles of}} concentration. The use of water treatment chemicals, pretreatment such as water softening, pH adjustment, and other techniques can affect the acceptable range of cycles of concentration.|$|E
2500|$|Draw-off or Blow-down — The {{portion of}} the {{circulating}} water flow that is removed (usually discharged to a drain) {{in order to maintain}} the amount of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and other impurities at an acceptably low level. [...] Higher TDS concentration in solution may result from greater cooling tower efficiency. However the higher the TDS concentration, the greater the risk of scale, biological growth and corrosion. The amount of blow-down is primarily designated by measuring by the electrical conductivity of the circulating water. Biological growth, scaling and corrosion can be prevented by chemicals (respectively, biocide, sulfuric acid, corrosion inhibitor). On the other hand, the only practical way to decrease the electrical conductivity is by increasing the amount of blow-down discharge and subsequently increasing the amount of clean <b>make-up</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Industrial {{cooling towers}} {{can be used}} to remove heat from various sources such as {{machinery}} or heated process material.

Control of the water balance in the solvent loop is successfully achieved by changing the washing water temperature. In previous publications regarding CO 2 capture pilot plants, the regulation of the water balance always required a <b>water</b> <b>make-up</b> flow which appears here as unnecessary.

25|$|The {{capacity}} of the DM plant is dictated by the type and quantity of salts in the raw water input. However, some storage is essential as the DM plant may be down for maintenance. For this purpose, a storage tank is installed from which DM water is continuously withdrawn for boiler make-up. The storage tank for DM water is made from materials not affected by corrosive water, such as PVC. The piping and valves are generally of stainless steel. Sometimes, a steam blanketing arrangement or stainless steel doughnut float is provided {{on top of the}} water in the tank to avoid contact with air. DM <b>water</b> <b>make-up</b> is generally added at the steam space of the surface condenser (i.e., the vacuum side). This arrangement not only sprays the water but also DM water gets deaerated, with the dissolved gases being removed by a de-aerator through an ejector attached to the condenser.|$|R

SFC x RPLC is {{a viable alternative to}} normal phase (NP) LC x RPLC and is characterized by high orthogonality. Compared to NPLC x RPLC an additional advantage is the expansion of supercritical carbon dioxide (CO 2) when exposed to atmospheric pressure leading to fractions consisting of solvents that are miscible with the second dimension RPLC mobile phase. The interface consists of a two-position/ten-port switching valve equipped with two packed octadecyl silica (C- 18) loops for effective trapping and focusing of the analytes after elution from the SFC dimension. The addition of a <b>water</b> <b>make-up</b> flow to the SFC effluent prior to entering the loops is of fundamental importance to efficiently focus the solutes on the C- 18 material and to reduce interferences of expanded CO 2 gas on the second dimension separation.

40|$|An industrial-scale {{biotrickling}} filter {{for the removal}} of high concentrations of H 2 S is described in this work. The system has been operating at H 2 S inlet concentrations between 1000 and 3000 ppmv at acidic conditions. A decrease of pH from 2. 6 to 1. 8 did not affect the biological activity inside the biofilter while reducing the <b>water</b> <b>make-up</b> consumption up to 75 %. The current oxygen supply system, based on direct injection of air to the liquid phase, has demonstrated to be inefficient for a long-term operation leading to elemental sulfur accumulation in the packing material (i. e. promoting clogging episodes). The present study demonstrates it is possible to partially remove (40. 3 %) the deposited elemental sulfur by bio-oxidation when biogas is not fed. In normal operation conditions, the implementation of an aeration system based on jet-venturi devices has shown quite promising results in terms of oxygen transfer efficiency and robustness. Such improvement of oxygen transfer was translated in a better conversion of H 2 S to sulfate, which increased around 17 %, prolonging the lifespan operation at low-pressure drop.

5000|$|... ==Boiler {{feedwater}} treatment== Boiler {{water treatment}} {{is used to}} control alkalinity, prevent scaling, correct pH, and to control conductivity. The boiler water needs to be alkaline and not acidic, {{so that it does}} not ruin the tubes. There can be too much conductivity in the feed water when there are too many dissolved solids. These correct treatments can be controlled by efficient operator and use of treatment chemicals. The main objectives to treat and condition boiler water is to exchange heat without scaling, protect against scaling, and produce high quality steam. The treatment of boiler water can be put into two parts. These are internal treatment and external treatment. (Sendelbach, p. 131) The internal treatment is for boiler feed water and external treatment is for <b>make-up</b> feed <b>water</b> and the condensate part of the system. Internal treatment protects against feed water hardness by preventing precipitating of scale on the boiler tubes. This treatment also protects against concentrations of dissolved and suspended solids in the feed water without priming or foaming. These treatment chemicals also help with the alkalinity of the feed water making it more of a base to help protect against boiler corrosion. The correct alkalinity is protected by adding phosphates. These phosphates precipitate the solids {{to the bottom of the}} boiler drum. At the bottom of the boiler drum there is a bottom blow to remove these solids. These chemicals also include anti-scaling agents, oxygen scavengers, and anti-foaming agents. Sludge can also be treated by two approaches. These are by coagulation and dispersion. When there is a high amount of sludge content it is better to coagulate the sludge to form large particles in order to just use the bottom blow to remove them from the feed water. When there is a low amount of sludge content it is better to use dispersants because it disperses the sludge throughout the feed water so sludge does not form.|$|R
50|$|In general, a dealkalizer is best {{applied to}} boilers {{operating}} below 700 psi (48 bar). In order to justify {{installation of a}} dealkalizer on low-pressure boilers, the alkalinity content should be above 50 ppm {{with the amount of}} <b>make-up</b> <b>water</b> exceeding 1,000 gallons (approx. 4,000 litres) per day.|$|E

40|$|As in most accelerators at the Advanced Photon Source, {{water is}} the media of choice for {{absorbing}} heat generated by a multitude of accelerator components. A large cooling water distribution system with flow rate of nearly 10, 000 gpm in the primary circuit and small closed-loop water systems with flow rates of less than 100 gpm are installed at the APS. The central plant houses primary water distribution pumps, heat rejection equipment, and polishing and <b>make-up</b> systems. All <b>water</b> used for heat rejection by accelerator equipment is deionized and filtered to provide minimum resistivity of 3 M{Omega}-cm and maximum particle size of 0. 5 microns. Water temperature and pressure are being controlled at 35 secondary systems before water is delivered to the accelerator components. Temperature of various water systems is controlled to as tight as + 0. 1 deg F. With most accelerator components interlocked on water flow and temperature, {{it is imperative that}} both are maintained {{with a high degree of}} reliability. It is also necessary for water systems to be designed with sufficient flexibility to allow for easy modifications, additions, and expansions.

2500|$|In the {{adjacent}} diagram, water pumped {{from the tower}} basin is the cooling water routed through the process coolers and condensers in an industrial facility. [...] The cool water absorbs heat from the hot process streams which need to be cooled or condensed, and the absorbed heat warms the circulating water (C). The warm water returns {{to the top of}} the cooling tower and trickles downward over the fill material inside the tower. [...] As it trickles down, it contacts ambient air rising up through the tower either by natural draft or by forced draft using large fans in the tower. That contact causes a small amount of the water to be lost as windage/drift (W) and some of the water (E) to evaporate. The heat required to evaporate the water is derived from the water itself, which cools the water back to the original basin water temperature and the water is then ready to recirculate. The evaporated water leaves its dissolved salts behind in the bulk of the water which has not been evaporated, thus raising the salt concentration in the circulating cooling water. To prevent the salt concentration of the water from becoming too high, a portion of the water is drawn off/blown down (D) for disposal. Fresh <b>water</b> <b>make-up</b> (M) is supplied to the tower basin to compensate for the loss of evaporated water, the windage loss water and the draw-off water.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{technical}} and economic feasibility of the installation of an innovative thermal concentrating solar system (TCSS) for high pressure steam production in a dairy is discussed. The production of soft cheese takes place thanks to the injection of saturated steam into washtubs that are filled with semi-finished materials. The steam is produced in natural gas fired tube boilers and is evidently lost and <b>make-up</b> fresh treated <b>water</b> at atmospheric conditions is required. In this context, the installation of a TCSS based on the technology of the linear Fresnel concentrating systems is proposed to provide part of the required steam and, consequently, to reduce the consumption of the fossil fuel improving the process environmental performances. To this purpose, the piping integration {{of the new system}} in the original one has been analyzed in detail respecting the essential safety requirements in accordance with the guidelines of the Pressurized Equipment Directive (PED) and maintaining the required service level to the thermal end-user. In order to assure a satisfying exploitation of the solar power source, the adoption of a storage system based on a pressurized vessel containing a mixture of water and steam has been considered and optimized from a technical and economic point of view. Indeed, the dairy production is scheduled only during six hours in the morning per day. This particular thermal load profile makes difficult the integration with the not programmable solar power source with peaks during the median hours of the day.
