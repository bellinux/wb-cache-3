25|$|We were {{scarcely}} a musket-shot from the shore, when the captain {{pointed out to}} <b>me</b> <b>one</b> of the midshipmen in the boat, {{of the name of}} Lockhart, asking me if I knew his family in Scotland. I answered in the negative, telling him that I had never been in any other service than that of Mrs. Gray. I was uneasy lest Mr. Lockhart should have recognized me for, as I had been a schoolfellow of his elder brother and frequently in the house of his father, Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, he might very possibly have known me. He was about eighteen years of age and had been four years in the navy. His eldest brother, the heir to a considerable estate, had been foolish enough, like so many others, to join the standard of Prince Charles.|$|E

25|$|Hugh Evan-Thomas {{was born}} the son of Charles Evan-Thomas, who was High Sheriff of Brecknockshire for 1885 and died at Cople in Bedfordshire aged 65 on 30 August 1928. A {{memorial}} service was held at Eglwys Oen Duw church in Llwynmadoc, Wales. A brass plaque in the church records his death. A year later, the council of Neath, Glamorgan purchased the Gnoll estate where Evan-Thomas was born {{to serve as a}} public park, where a war memorial would be erected. Jellicoe wrote a tribute to Evan-Thomas saying, 'If I had one loyal and splendid supporter during the Great War in the Grand Fleet, one who never failed <b>me,</b> <b>one</b> who led his ships magnificently, and not only led them magnificently but brought them to a pitch of efficiency that was a pattern for the whole of the Grand fleet, It was Admiral Sir Hugh Evan-Thomas'.|$|E

I thought if I were to be weak I would have a depression. But every day I would wake up and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E

"Honey, Just Allow <b>Me</b> <b>One</b> More Chance" [...] {{is based}} on [...] "Honey, Won't You Allow <b>Me</b> <b>One</b> More Chance?", a song {{dating back to the}} 1890s that was popularized by Henry Thomas in his 1928 recording. [...] "However, Thomas's {{original}} provided no more than a song title and a notion", writes Heylin, [...] "which Dylan turned into a personal plea to an absent lover to allow him 'one more chance to get along with you.' It is a vocal tour de force and ... showed a Dylan prepared to make light of his own blues by using the form itself." ...|$|E
