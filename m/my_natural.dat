500|$|The {{controversy}} had far-reaching {{effects in}} literary and scientific circles, and marked {{the only time}} that a President of the United States weighed in as a [...] "literary and cultural critic—specifically, as an ecocritic." [...] Though blind naturalist and author Clarence Hawkes deemed the literary debate [...] "a veritable tempest in the teapot", after the controversy had died down, he came to believe [...] "if I ever make a bad break in regard to <b>my</b> <b>natural</b> history statements that I was doomed." [...] The author Ralph H. Lutts wrote in his 1990 work The Nature Fakers: Wildlife, Science & Sentiment, the nature fakers controversy [...] "was far more than a clash over the accuracy of animal stories or the question of whether animals can reason"; rather, the debate signified the changing sensibilities of writers and readers {{at the turn of the}} 20th century.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1954 Cleveland Indians season, Houtteman's second daughter, Hollis Ann, was born on February 22. His {{pitching}} continued to improve under Mel Harder, who [...] "got me to quit experimenting and to seek <b>my</b> <b>natural</b> delivery". The Indians used him when they could, especially in extra inning affairs. In the Indians' first six extra inning games, Houtteman was used three times. As a result, Houtteman finished the season with a career-high 11 complete games. The Indians also began to use Houtteman and Feller for doubleheaders with great success, as they had a 9–1 record after their first five doubleheaders. Houtteman finished the season with a 15–7 record, a 3.35 ERA, and 188 innings pitched. In the 1954 World Series with the Indians, he pitched two innings in Game 3 against the New York Giants, allowing one run and striking out one batter.|$|E

500|$|A pre-taped {{performance}} of Brown performing {{a medley of}} [...] "Beautiful People" [...] and [...] "Forever" [...] was shown on the American version of Dancing with the Stars on March 29, 2011. For the performance Brown wore {{a black and white}} suit, and was accompanied by a group of robotic dancers dressed in all-white suits adorned with LED lighting for a futuristic Tron-like affect. Prior to the performance some of the show's cast were unhappy that Brown was going to perform because of the domestic violence assault that occurred with his then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009. Brown was sentenced to five years of probation, ordered to complete more than 1,400 hours of community service and was given a restraining order which required him to stay away from Rihanna. Professional dancer Cheryl Burke told Extra, [...] "As a victim of domestic violence, I don't agree with him coming on the show, but it's out of my control", while host Tom Bergeron told the On Air with Ryan Seacrest radio show that, [...] "I did tell the producers it may be to their advantage to not have me interview him, because <b>my</b> <b>natural</b> tendency would be to say something. So don't put me in a position where you are asking me to not say something, because I really won't do that." ...|$|E
500|$|On 4 April {{they entered}} the harbour of Rio de Janeiro, to make {{observations}} of longitude from Villegagnon Island. Darwin took in the sights of the city then made an expedition into the interior, returning to the ship on 24 April. By then Robert McCormick had left the ship, with permission from the admiral in command, and returned to England. Assistant Surgeon Benjamin Bynoe was made acting surgeon in his place. McCormick felt [...] "very much disappointed in my expectations of carrying out <b>my</b> <b>natural</b> history pursuits, every obstacle having been placed {{in the way of}} my getting on shore and making collections" [...] while the gentleman Darwin received all the invitations from dignitaries onshore and was given facilities to pack his collections. On 26 April Darwin moved into a house he had rented at Botafogo, and stayed there with three others when the Beagle left on 10 May to recheck observations at Bahia. FitzRoy had found a discrepancy of [...] in the meridian distance of longitude between his measurements and those of Albin Roussin, and decided to go back. A seaman, a ship's boy and a young midshipman had caught a fever after visiting the Macacu River, and died. When the ship returned to Rio on 3 June, FitzRoy confirmed that his measurements of Bahia and of the Abrolhos reefs were correct, and sent these corrections to Roussin. They sailed from Rio on 5 July.|$|E
500|$|A pre-taped {{performance}} of Brown performing [...] "Yeah 3x" [...] and {{a medley of}} [...] "Beautiful People" [...] and [...] "Forever" [...] was shown on the American version of Dancing with the Stars on March 29, 2011. For the performance, Brown wore a tomato red tuxedo and a black shirt and bow tie. The performance started off with a young boy doing break dancing moves and announcing, 'Here is Chris Brown'. Brown then appeared doing flips and somersaults, as he lip-synced most of the song. The performance earned him a standing ovation from the judges {{and members of the}} crowd. Prior to the performance, some of the show's cast were unhappy that Brown was going to perform because of the domestic violence assault that occurred with his then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009.

500|$|Patton {{called his}} career, with its mixture of children's {{television}} and darker roles in independent films, [...] "an odd experience" [...] and {{told a reporter}} that he had spent half his life at Nickelodeon. [...] In 2009, he was cast as Bot, the robot superhero, on the children's show Team Umizoomi through the relationships he had made at Nickelodeon on Blue's Clues. [...] He found working on Team Umizoomi [...] "comforting" [...] {{because many of the}} same crew, producers, and creators had also worked on Blue's Clues. [...] It {{was the first time he}} had worked as a voice-over artist, unlike on Blue's Clues, when he was able to be more physical acting in front of a blue screen. [...] He said, about Team Umizoomi, [...] "the work the animators have done on it has been superlative". [...] He stated that he enjoyed working on Team Umizoomi because it gave him the opportunity to participate in a show from its inception, which he had missed with Blue's Clues. [...] Patton said his voice performance of Bot, which he modeled on Brent Spiner's performance as the android Data on [...] and was influenced by Mel Blanc's work in the classic Warner Bros. cartoons, [...] "ended up sounding more like <b>my</b> <b>natural</b> voice, with a teeny bit of superhero in there". [...] Despite both roles in Blue's Clues and Team Umizoomi requiring him to sing, he did not consider himself a natural singer and felt that he had to work hard at it. [...] He said, about being cast as Bot, [...] "I get to be a superhero. Who doesn't want to be a superhero"?.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the third}} day of the trial, Hunt asked Anthony whether she had {{anything}} to say.

2500|$|He {{made his}} Test match debut in 1984 at Lord's against England.

He later commented on his aggressive batting style: [...] "That's <b>my</b> <b>natural</b> game – I don't want to change because I feel confident playing that way. If someone is capable of dominating the bowling, they should do it. It's the way I've been playing since I was a youngster." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{his years}} of musical study, Pavarotti held {{part-time}} jobs in order to sustain himself – first as {{an elementary school teacher}} and then as an insurance salesman. The first six years of study resulted in only a few recitals, all in small towns and without pay. When a nodule developed on his vocal cords, causing a [...] "disastrous" [...] concert in Ferrara, he decided to give up singing. Pavarotti attributed his immediate improvement to the psychological release connected with this decision. Whatever the reason, the nodule not only disappeared but, as he related in his autobiography: [...] "Everything I had learned came together with <b>my</b> <b>natural</b> voice to make the sound I had been struggling so hard to achieve".|$|E
2500|$|Despite any {{difficulties}} that his suspected Communist sympathies might have posed, Copland traveled extensively during the 1950s and early 60s {{to observe the}} avant-garde styles of Europe, hear compositions by Soviet composers not {{well known in the}} West and experience the new school of Polish music. While in Japan, he was taken with the work of Toru Takemitsu and began a correspondence with him that would last over the next decade. Copland revised his text [...] "The New Music" [...] with comments on the styles that he encountered. He found much of what he heard dull and impersonal. Electronic music seemed to have [...] "a depressing sameness of sound," [...] while aleatoric music was for those [...] "who enjoy teetering on the edge of chaos." [...] As he summarized, [...] "I've spent most of my life trying to get the right note in the right place. Just throwing it open to chance seems to go against <b>my</b> <b>natural</b> instincts." ...|$|E

The next site was the Harry Potter Lexicon, an online encyclopedia Rowling has admitted to visiting while writing away from home rather than buying a copy of her books in a store. She called it [...] "for the dangerously obsessive; <b>my</b> <b>natural</b> home." [...] The third site of 2004 was MuggleNet, a web site featuring the latest news in the Potter world, among editorials, forums, and a podcast. Rowling wrote when giving the award, [...] "It's high time I paid homage to the mighty MuggleNet," [...] and listed all the features she loved, including [...] "the pretty-much-exhaustive information on all books and films." [...] The last site was HPANA, the first fan site Rowling ever visited, [...] "faster off the mark with Harry Potter news than any other site" [...] Rowling knows, and [...] "fantastically user-friendly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two years later, Einstein {{released}} the album Mazal Gdi (Capricorn), {{which was not}} very successful. He therefore looked for a new sound {{and went on to}} produce the album Puzi with the Churchills, considered the first Israeli rock album. He stopped performing live in the early 1980s. He said: [...] "I performed from the age of 18 until I was 42...I wasn't exactly a stage animal. I was held back by the embarrassment, the bashfulness, and it became more evident as the years went by... By the way, when I say bashfulness, I'm not proud of it... I wish I could grab a microphone and sing like a Sinatra, but I don't have what it takes, and a person should adapt to his capabilities. On the other hand, in the studio, I blossom. That's <b>my</b> <b>natural</b> habitat, where I'm not bashful. The problem is that this profession has its field mines: success is accompanied by fame and a form of adoration, and I really don't get along with that. That's where I draw the line. It's pleasant to be loved, but not more." [...] For those who knew Einstein this came as no surprise. Einstein was regarded as a very humble and modest musician who focused solely on the artistic and creative aspect of the musical world and actively shied away from the lime-light, fame, and the entertainment business. This was also evident much later in his career when he preferred to collaborate with lesser known and younger musicians as the lifestyle and obsession with fame of more prominent artists did not suit his style.|$|E
