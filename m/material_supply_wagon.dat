50|$|One of the {{advantages}} of the Spencer was that its ammunition was waterproof and hardy, and could stand the constant jostling of long storage on the march, such as Wilson's Raid. The story goes that every round of paper and linen Sharps ammunition carried in the <b>supply</b> <b>wagons</b> was found useless after long storage in <b>supply</b> <b>wagons.</b> Spencer ammunition had no such problem.|$|R

2500|$|Following {{the relief}} army to Fort Harrison {{was a party}} of {{thirteen}} soldiers under Lieutenant Fairbanks of the Seventh Infantry escorting a <b>supply</b> <b>wagon</b> loaded with flour and meat. [...] On September 13, 1812, the <b>supply</b> <b>wagon</b> was ambushed by a Potawatomi war party at {{a part of the}} trail known as The Narrows, an area near modern Fairbanks, Indiana, which has many ravines that serve as tributaries to Prairie Creek. [...] When the ambush was launched, the draft horses panicked and ran away with the wagon. [...] Only two men– the wagoneer, John Black, and Private Edward Perdue– managed to escape back to Fort Knox alive, although Perdue was discharged due to the severe wounds he received. [...] Luckily for the two survivors, the Potawatomi gave chase to the runaway <b>supply</b> <b>wagon.</b> [...] Eleven soldiers and all the provisions were lost to the United States, and several Potawatomi warriors had been killed or wounded.|$|R

2500|$|A second {{column of}} two <b>supply</b> <b>wagons</b> and fifteen {{soldiers}} under Lieutenant Richardson {{set out from}} Vincennes {{two days after the}} first wagon, following the same trail, and unaware of the fate of the first. [...] When the Potawatomi learned that a second <b>supply</b> <b>wagon</b> was approaching, they set up the same ambush. [...] On September 15, after the initial attack, Richardson realized he was outmanned, and ordered a retreat. [...] The wagons were left behind to be plundered, which may have saved the lives of the retreating soldiers. [...] Even so, seven men had been killed, and another had been badly wounded.|$|R
5000|$|Around 1652, [...] Juan and Tomás Manso {{traveled}} to New Spain on a mission. This mission supplied caravans from Mexico City to Santa Fe, New Mexico. In 1656 he began {{work with the}} mission <b>supply</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R

Some {{of the items in}} the <b>supply</b> <b>wagons</b> were official diplomatic presents, necessary for making peace with Native Americans at Fort Pitt. Other items, however, were trade goods sent by Indian trader [...] George Croghan, who was seeking to recoup his losses from the French and Indian War. Croghan had secretly (and illegally) included rum and gunpowder in the shipments {{in order to make a}} profit once trade with the Indians was legally resumed.|$|R
