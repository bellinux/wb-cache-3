The catalyst used was poly(styrene-vinylferrocene) in toluene solution which has an iron content of 2. 1 %. The etched silicon wafers have trench regions of varying widths ranging from 0. 32 to 1 μm. For trench widths below 0. 5 μm the number of “interconnecting” tubes growing {{from one side of}} the trench to the other increases sharply. A significant proportion of these “interconnects” are found to be Y-junction and <b>multiple</b> <b>junction</b> MWNTs. A systematic study of the effects of each of the growth conditions (temperature, run time, gas flow, catalyst concentration and trench width) versus interconnect yield was carried out.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{investigated}} changes in vascular endothelial cell tight <b>junction</b> <b>structure</b> and {{the expression of}} the gene encoding connexin 40 (Cx 40) at the early pneu-monedema stage of hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in a newborn rat model. A total of 96 newborn rats were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the following two groups, the hyperoxia group (n= 48) and the control group (n= 48). A hyperoxia-induced BPD model was established for the first group, while rats in the control group were maintained under normoxic conditions. Extravasation of Evans Blue (EB) was measured; the severity of lung injury was assessed; a trans-mission electron microscope (TEM) was used to examine the vascular endothelial cell tight <b>junction</b> <b>structures,</b> and immunohistochemical assay, western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to evaluate the expression of Cx 40 at the mRNA and protein level. Our findings showed that injuries due to BPD are progressively intensified during the time-course of exposure to hyperoxic conditions. Pulmonary vascular permeability in the hyperoxia group reached the highest level at day 5, and was significantly higher compared to the control group. TEM observations demonstrated tight junctions between endothe-lial cells were extremely tight. In the hyperoxia group, no marked changes in the tight <b>junction</b> <b>structure</b> were found at days 1 and 3; paracellular gaps were visible between endo-thelial cells at days 5 and 7. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the Cx 40 protein is mainly expressed in the vascular endothelial cells of lung tissue. Western blotting and RT-PCR assays showed a gradual decrease in Cx 40 expres-sion, depending on the exposure time to hyperoxic conditions. However, the Cx 40 mRNA level reached a trough at 5 days. Overall, our study demonstrated that exposure to hyperoxia damages the tight <b>junction</b> <b>structures</b> between vascular endo-thelial cells and downregulates Cx 40. We therefore conclude that hyperoxia may participate in the regulation of pulmonary vascular endothelial permeability...|$|R

40|$|Intestinal {{absorptive}} cells may modulate {{both the}} structure and function of occluding junctions by a cytoskeleton dependent mechanism (Madara, J. L., 1983, J. Cell Biol., 97 : 125 - 136). To further examine the putative relationship between absorptive cell occluding junctions and the cytoskeleton, we assessed the effects of cytochalasin D (CD) on occluding <b>junction</b> function and <b>structure</b> in guinea pig ileum using ultrastructural and Ussing chamber techniques. Maximal decrements in transepithelial resistance and junctional charge selectivity were obtained with 10 micrograms/ml CD and the dose-response curves for these two functional parameters were highly similar. Analysis of simultaneous flux studies of sodium and the nonabsorbable extracellular tracer mannitol suggested that CD opened a transjunctional shunt and that this shunt could fully account for the increase in sodium permeability and thus the decrease in resistance. Structural studies including electron microscopy of detergent-extracted cytoskeletal preparations revealed that 10 micrograms/ml CD produced condensation of filamentous elements of the peri-junctional contractile ring {{and that this was}} associated with brush border contraction as assessed by scanning electron microscopy. Quantitative freeze-fracture studies revealed marked aberrations in absorptive cell occluding <b>junction</b> <b>structure</b> including diminished strand number, reduced strand-strand cross-linking, and failure of strands to impede the movement of intramembrane particles across them. In aggregate these studies show that CD-induced perturbation of the absorptive cell cytoskeleton results in production of a transepithelial shunt which is fully explained by a defect in the transjunctional pathway. Furthermore, substantial structural abnormalities in occluding <b>junction</b> <b>structure</b> accompany this response. Lastly, the abnormalities in occluding <b>junction</b> <b>structure</b> and function coincide with structural changes in and contraction of the peri-junctional actin-myosin ring. These data suggest that a functionally relevant association may exist between the cytoskeleton and the occluding junction of absorptive cells. We speculate that such an association may serve as a mechanism by which absorptive cells regulate paracellular transport...|$|R

40|$|Integrated dynamic {{systems such}} as {{mechatronic}} or control systems generally contain passive elements and internal energy sources that are appropriately modulated to perform the desired dynamic actions. The overall passivity of such systems is a useful property that relates to the stability {{and the safety of}} the system, {{in the sense that the}} maximum net amount of energy that the system can impart to the environment is limited by its initial state. In this paper, conditions under which a physical system containing internal modulated sources is globally passive are investigated using bond graph modelling techniques. For the class of systems under consideration, bond graph models include power bonds and active (signals) bonds modulating embedded energy sources, so that the continuity of power (or energy conservation) in the <b>junction</b> <b>structure</b> is not satisfied. For the purpose of the analysis, a so-called bond graph pseudo <b>junction</b> <b>structure</b> is proposed as an alternative representation for Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) bond graph models with internal modulated sources. The pseudo <b>junction</b> <b>structure</b> highlights the existence of a multiport coupled resistive field involving the modulation gains of the internal sources and the parameters of dissipative elements, therefore implicitly realising the balance of internal energy generation and dissipation. Moreover, it can be regarded as consisting of an inner structure which satisfies the continuity of power, and an outer structure in which a power scaling is performed in relation with the dissipative field. The associated multiport coupled resistive field constitutive equations can then be used to determine the passivity property of the overall system. The paper focuses on systems interconnected in cascade (with no loading effect) or in closed-loop configurations which are common in control systems...|$|R
