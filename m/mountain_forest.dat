5|$|Voalavo is a genus of rodent in the {{subfamily}} Nesomyinae, {{found only}} in Madagascar. Two species are known, both of which occur in <b>mountain</b> <b>forest</b> above 1250m (4100ft) altitude; the northern voalavo lives in northern Madagascar and eastern voalavo is restricted to a small area in {{the central part of}} the island. The genus was discovered in 1994 and formally described in 1998. Within Nesomyinae, it is most closely related to the genus Eliurus, and DNA sequence data suggest that the current definitions of these two genera need to be changed.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus' {{divisions}} met {{up to the}} north, and ravaged {{the countryside}} between the Ems and the Lippe, and penetrated to the Teutoburg Forest, a <b>mountain</b> <b>forest</b> in Western Germany situated between these two rivers. There, Germanicus {{and some of his}} men visited the site of the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, and began burying the remains of the Roman soldiers that had been left in the open. After half a day of the work, he called off the burial of bones so that they could continue their war against the Germans. He made his way into the heartland of the Cherusci. At a location Tacitus calls the pontes longi ("long causeways"), in boggy lowlands somewhere near the Ems, Arminius' troops attacked the Romans. Arminius initially caught Germanicus' cavalry in a trap, inflicting minor casualties, but the Roman infantry reinforced the rout and checked them. The fighting lasted for two days, with neither side achieving a decisive victory. Germanicus' forces withdrew and returned to the Rhine.|$|E

25|$|The unique flora, fauna and {{tropical}} forest ecosystem {{of the island}} are systematically researched by both Indonesian and foreign scientific bodies. The original vegetation on the coastal plain has been cleared, {{and much of the}} <b>mountain</b> <b>forest</b> on the northern side of the island has been cut and burned out for timber and creating new farming fields, but two large areas of stable rain forest still exist in the mountains. These are currently protected areas, Gunung Kapalat Mada (1,380km2) and Waeapo (50km2).|$|E
25|$|Bolivian {{ecosystems}} are {{linked with the}} characteristics of every river basin. The Endorreic basin hosts a typical Central Andean dry puna, the inter-Andean valleys host <b>mountain</b> <b>forest,</b> and the east valleys host tropical forests and wet savannas. The endorreic basin, with little vegetation and precipitation and 40% of Bolivia’s population, has traditionally been dedicated to agriculture and mining. In the inter-Andean valleys, with steep slopes, {{there is a need}} for irrigation and terraces to avoid soil erosion. These valleys produce high crop yields and benefit Bolivia’s overall economy. Drainage systems and fragility of soil are the main challenges in the tropical east. Agriculture in this area has grown to produce soya, cotton, sunflowers, and sugarcane.|$|E

25|$|Around 16,000 BC, {{from the}} Red Sea hills to the {{northern}} Ethiopian Highlands, nuts, grasses and tubers were being collected for food. By 13,000 to 11,000 BC, people began collecting wild grains. This spread to Western Asia, which domesticated its wild grains, wheat and barley. Between 10,000 and 8000 BC, Northeast Africa was cultivating wheat and barley and raising sheep and cattle from Southwest Asia. A wet climatic phase in Africa turned the Ethiopian Highlands into a <b>mountain</b> <b>forest.</b> Omotic speakers domesticated enset around 65005500 BC. Around 7000 BC, the settlers of the Ethiopian highlands domesticated donkeys, and by 4000 BC domesticated donkeys had spread to Southwest Asia. Cushitic speakers, partially turning away from cattle herding, domesticated teff and finger millet between 5500 and 3500 BC.|$|E
25|$|On October 27, 1927, {{a meeting}} of representatives from the {{surrounding}} communities were called to the Court House in Neepawa, Manitoba to discuss a proposal to designate the Riding <b>Mountain</b> <b>Forest</b> Reserve a national park. Led by J. N. McFadden, the meeting aimed to highlight to residents the differences between a forest reserve and national park. One major difference is that its natural resources would be completely protected from development. Since 1918 reforestation had proceeded in the park, and it was planned as a destination for tourists to continue to invest money in the local economy. Although some wanted a national park to {{be located in the}} Whiteshell, a majority officially voted in favour of locating it in Riding Mountain. As a consequence of this decision logging operations were halted and the value of Duck Mountain increased.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} soil zones. The Northern forest-steppe zone covers the Danubian Plain and the Pre-Balkan up to 600–700m altitude. The Danubian Plain is characterised by the fertile black earth chernozem, that {{accounts}} for 54% of the zone's area, while the Pre-Balkan is dominated by grey forest soils (39%), which have good physical characteristics but are low in organic matter and phosphorus. The Southern xerothermal zone encompasses Southern Bulgaria up to 700–800m altitude and includes several specific soil types due to the more diverse topography and climate. The most common soil types are the cinnamon forest soils with acidic (cinnamonic) traces, smolnitsi and yellow-podzolic soils. The Mountain zone covers the mountainous regions above 700–800m altitude and has a zonal soil cover. The brown forest soils are distributed at altitudes of 1000–2000m, the dark <b>mountain</b> <b>forest</b> soils {{can be found at}} 1700–2200m altitude and the mountain meadow soils— above 1700m. These soils are typically shallow and prone to erosion and are usually acid to strongly acid.|$|E

500|$|Drymoreomys {{was first}} {{recorded}} in 1992 by Meika Mustrangi {{in the state}} of São Paulo. The animal was not, however, formally described until 2011, when Alexandre Percequillo and colleagues named it as a new genus and species within the tribe Oryzomyini: Drymoreomys albimaculatus. The generic name, Drymoreomys, combines the Greek δρυμός (drymos), meaning [...] "forest", ὄρειος (oreios), meaning [...] "mountain-dwelling", and μῦς (mys), meaning [...] "mouse". The name refers to the animal's occurrence in <b>mountain</b> <b>forest.</b> The specific name, albimaculatus, derives from the Latin albus, meaning [...] "white", and maculatus, meaning [...] "spotted", a reference to the spots of white in the animal's fur. Percequillo and colleagues found little geographic variation among samples of Drymoreomys, although a few traits differ in frequency between populations from the states of São Paulo and Santa Catarina.|$|E
500|$|Like {{most of the}} Indian subcontinent, Tripura {{lies within}} the Indomalaya ecozone. According to the Biogeographic {{classification}} of India, the state is in the [...] "North-East" [...] biogeographic zone. In 2011 forests covered 57.73 per cent of the state. Tripura hosts three different types of ecosystems: <b>mountain,</b> <b>forest</b> and freshwater. The evergreen forests on the hill slopes and the sandy river banks are dominated by species such as Dipterocarpus, Artocarpus, Amoora, Elaeocarpus, Syzygium and Eugenia. Two types of moist deciduous forests comprise majority of the vegetation: moist deciduous mixed forest and Sal (Shorea robusta)-predominant forest. The interspersion of bamboo and cane forests with deciduous and evergreen flora is a peculiarity of Tripura's vegetation. Grasslands and swamps are also present, particularly in the plains. Herbaceous plants, shrubs, and trees such as Albizia, Barringtonia, Lagerstroemia and Macaranga flourish in the swamps of Tripura. Shrubs and grasses include Schumannianthus dichotoma (shitalpati), Phragmites and Saccharum (sugarcane).|$|E
