2500|$|The poem {{has been}} {{translated}} into Danish, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Ilocano, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Tagalog, and other languages. Several Swedish versions exist. One version starts: [...] "Gråt ej vid min grav..." [...] Translated, it reads: [...] "Do not weep at my grave - I am not there / I am in the sun's reflection in the sea / I am in the wind's play above the grain fields / I am in the autumn's gentle rain / I am in the Milky Way's string of stars / And when on an early <b>morning</b> <b>you</b> are awaked by bird's song / It is my voice that you are hearing / So do not weep at my grave - we shall meet again." [...] (Instead of these last four words there is also this version: [...] "I am not dead. I only left".) ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel said in {{the name}} of Rabbi Joshua that from the day that the Temple was destroyed, there was no day without a curse, the dew had not descended for a blessing, and the flavor had {{departed}} from fruits.. Rava said that in addition, the curse of each day was severer than that of the preceding day, as [...] says, [...] "In the <b>morning</b> <b>you</b> shall say: Would God it were evening! And in the evening you shall say: Would God it were morning." [...] The Gemara asked which morning they would long for. If it would be the morning of the next day, nobody knows what that will be like. Therefore, reasoned the Gemara, {{it must have been the}} morning of the previous day (because the previous day would have been less severe than the current day, and therefore they longed for its return)..|$|E
2500|$|Sellers was {{executed}} {{by lethal injection}} at 12:17a.m. on February 4, 1999. He spoke to his step-siblings, saying, [...] "All {{the people who are}} hating me right now and are here waiting to see me die, when {{you wake up in the}} <b>morning,</b> <b>you</b> aren't going to feel any different. You are going to hate me as much tomorrow as you do tonight. Reach out to God and he will hear you. Let him touch your hearts. Don't hate all your lives.". Sellers did not mention his mother or apologize for what he had done. His statement outraged his step-siblings. Noelle Terry, his stepsister, later said, [...] "He basically addressed the fact that we would still feel the same. It is very presumptuous that he would know how we would still feel." [...] His last words were a modern Christian music song: [...] "Set my spirit free that I might praise Thee. Set my spirit free that I might worship Thee." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "(O'Hare) {{was a great}} swimmer and spear fisherman, and {{he insisted}} that the {{squadron}} swim with him. Swimming with Butch O'Hare meant that at eight o'clock in the <b>morning,</b> <b>you</b> swam out into the ocean off Maui; he would still be out there {{at three in the}} afternoon! If he got hungry, Butch would roll over and dive, {{and the next thing you}} knew, he would come up with a fish of some sort. Then he'd just roll over and lie on his back like an otter and eat the thing raw! He really impressed us with that! One day, he came back to the surface with an octopus draped over his arm. He said, 'Now, you have to learn how to kill these things, boys: you bite 'em right behind the eye.' And with that, he chomped down! The octopus has some sort of spinal cord there, and biting it there does kill it! Then we had to go back to the beach where Butch would put these things in a frying pan with a little oil and some salt and stir them around. He enjoyed them, but they tasted like old rubber tires to me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In the War of the Fourth Coalition, the 5th Hussars were {{assigned}} to Antoine Lasalle's light cavalry division and brigaded with the 7th Hussars. The hussar brigade helped rout a Prussian flank guard at Zehdenick on 26 October 1806 and fought at the Battle of Prenzlau on the 28th. On 30 October the Capitulation of Stettin occurred. With only 800 hussars, Lasalle bluffed Friedrich Romberg into surrendering the fortress and its garrison of 5,300 Prussians. The demand to surrender was carried by Schwarz, who addressed Romberg, [...] "I’ve been sent by my superior, the Grand Duke of Berg, who summons you to surrender to him tomorrow <b>morning.</b> <b>You</b> will be granted the honors of war." [...] Romberg refused, but Schwarz returned an hour later with an ultimatum announcing that a bombardment would precede an attack by 50,000 troops if Stettin was not surrendered by 8:00 AM. Furthermore, the garrison would not be granted quarter and the town would be sacked. At this, Romberg caved in. The 5th Hussars fought at the Battle of Golymin on 26 December 1806. Schwarz became a general of brigade on 30 December 1806 and a Baron of the Empire on 9 March 1808.|$|E
