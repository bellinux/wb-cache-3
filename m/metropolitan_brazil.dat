40|$|This {{work has}} as its {{objective}} to estimate the expected unemployment duration and to verify the reason for which the individual has difficulty of finding a new job in <b>metropolitan</b> <b>Brazil</b> {{in the year of}} 1999. For this purpose, we use the micro data’s of the Monthly Employment Survey (PME). The results obtained through the estimador of Kaplan-Meier show that the probability of the unemployed individuals stay in the unemployment state for at least 6 months is 48. 83 % and 25. 10 % for at least 1 year. On average unemployment duration is, approximately, 10 months. The parametric and extended parametric duration models allow to conclude that the individuals with grade levels of elementary and junior high school, with larger time of not- work, in son's condition and those resident in the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro have smaller probability of finding a new job, while those that never worked with remuneration, those that receive FGTS in the last job, residents in the metropolitan areas of Recife, Salvador and Belo Horizonte have larger probability of leaving the state unemployment. unemployment duration; labor market...|$|E
40|$|The public {{policies}} on mass transit {{and other economic}} policies {{have been unable to}} avoid increasing mass transit costs and urban bus fares, which places a burden on a majority of the population depending on public transit. This study analyzes the variations in urban bus fares and households income and analyzes their effects on the demand of paying commuters in 9 large Brazilian cities between 1995 and 2008. The study shows that a gap between the rise of urban bus fares and the population's income led to a decrease of more than 30 % of the paying demand between 1995 and 2003. According to the price elasticity estimated in this study, demand for bus services has exhibited elastic behavior since 2001. Since then, the gradual increase observed in population income seems to buffer against persistent fare increases. The recovery of average household per capita income since then seems to support a reversal of downward trends in the number of paying passengers and increase access to public bus services. The number of paying passengers increased about 9. 5 % between 2003 and 2008. The evolution of the sector's main costs complement the study, permitting an analysis of the many factors that have caused the continuous increases of bus fares in <b>metropolitan</b> <b>Brazil</b> during this period. The study concludes highlighting some {{public policies}} that could provide a better economic environment for the provision of efficient and affordable transit services...|$|E
40|$|Since the National Constitution of 1988, {{state governments}} are {{responsible}} for defining their own metropolitan areas in Brazil. However, the criteria for boundaries delimitation are not clearly defined as a rule. As a consequence, {{it is not possible}} to weigh the pros and cons of the employed methodologies. Furthermore, comparative analysis on the performance of social and economic indicators in these metropolitan areas can be compromised as result of using multiple methodologies for defining territorial limits. The discussion of this issue could not be more timely, as the National Congress is currently debating a bill (aka Statute of the Metropolis) that proposes one single method for defining national metropolitan areas and its boundaries. To contribute to this debate, we estimate in this paper the metropolitan areas Brazil would have in 2010 by applying to the whole country the same criteria and following one single method. For this purpose, we have adopted the same method and criteria originally used for the definition of the first metropolitan areas of the country in the 1970 's, with minor adjustments. The obtained results are then compared with the official metropolitan areas showing rather different figures. Compared with official areas, our estimates show a <b>metropolitan</b> <b>Brazil</b> i) comprising a smaller number of metropolitan areas; ii) covering about half the number of municipalities; iii) with stronger commuting ties; iv) occupying a land area about three times more compact and dense; and yet v) with minor differences in terms of population size and GDP...|$|E

This study describes the estimates and associations of 12 -month DSM-IV prevalence rates of mental disorders and use of health services with employment status by gender in the São Paulo <b>Metropolitan</b> Area, <b>Brazil.</b> Data from the São Paulo Megacity Mental Health Survey was analyzed (n = 5, 037). This is a population-based study assessing the prevalence and determinants of mental disorders among adults, using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.

40|$|Brazil is {{characterized}} by racial and socioeconomic segregation. The objective of the research presented here is to analyze socioeconomic and racial segregation in three metropolitan areas (Recife, Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre). Microdata from the 2000 Brazilian Census was used for this analysis, as well as maps produced for the selected areas by groups of census tracts (áreas de ponderação), using Geographic Information Systems techniques. In general, results indicate that among those areas with a majority of whites, {{a high proportion of}} the population holds at least high school degree. Moreover, the nonwhite population lives farther away from the core of the municipality, compared to whites. Finally, whites tend to live in less elevated areas with more public infrastructure and a greater availability of major roads. An improvement to this research could be the inclusion of spatial analysis and statistical models to better understand the relationship between race and socioeconomic indicators.
