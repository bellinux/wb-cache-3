2500|$|East of this station, {{next to the}} {{southbound}} track, the bellmouth {{with the}} ramp ascending to the upper level once had a layup track on it. On the Roosevelt Avenue <b>interlocking</b> <b>machine</b> in the station tower, there are spare levers for the necessary signals and switches. On the southbound local track, there is a homeball signal, [...] "D1-1415", which has the lower portion lenses covered over and now functions as an automatic signal. The <b>interlocking</b> <b>machine</b> still shows evidence of the now-nonexistent interlocking where the Winfield spur was to have turned off from the D1 track and the D2 track.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} {{upgraded}} {{as part of}} the Regional Fast Rail project, with the platforms re-aligned, the <b>manual</b> <b>interlocking</b> frame and railway crossing gates decommissioned, and new remote controlled computer based signalling provided. Also, as part of this project, the double line between Kyneton and Bendigo was singled.|$|R
50|$|Those of Petty's {{cartoons}} that depict themes {{such as the}} economy, {{international relations}} or other social issues as complicated <b>interlocking</b> <b>machines</b> (that manipulate, or are manipulated by, people) have been likened to Rube Goldberg machines or Heath Robinson contraptions.|$|R
50|$|The tower {{that existed}} east of this station was also built in {{anticipation}} of a junction between this line and an elevated Canarsie line. The Wyckoff tower never had an <b>interlocking</b> <b>machine</b> installed, but was used as an office instead.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was opened}} for {{operation}} in 1875 for {{an extension of}} the Metropolitan Railway. It was converted to an <b>interlocking</b> <b>machine</b> room in the 1950s. In 2013 it became the third signal box on the London Underground network to be listed.__notoc__ ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{term has}} also {{occasionally}} been co-opted by broader mechanical engineering {{to refer to}} the similarity of fit between two <b>interlocking</b> <b>machined</b> parts, although [...] "tolerance" [...] or [...] "backlash" [...] has gained far wider adoption and acceptance in usage.|$|R
5000|$|Electric locking: [...] "The {{combination}} {{of one or}} more electric locks or controlling circuits by means of which levers in an <b>interlocking</b> <b>machine,</b> or switches or other devices operated in connection with signalling and interlocking, are secured against operation under certain conditions." ...|$|R
50|$|An <b>Interlocking</b> <b>machine</b> room (IMR) is a {{component}} of the London Underground signalling system. Generally found at platform ends, the rooms consist of pneumatically controlled mechanically and electrically interlocked levers mounted horizontally in an upright lever-frame. It is used to control points and signals.|$|R
5000|$|The {{signal box}} was {{subsequently}} converted to an <b>interlocking</b> <b>machine</b> room (IMR), and from 16 November 1956 {{it was closed}} and operated remotely from the [...] signal box. Control was transferred to Baker Street on 25 March 2001. As of 2017 the IMR is still in use.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} 8800 mi railway {{track in the}} {{province}} of Saskatchewan. Rail companies were intersected 58 times at level crossings. Some of these were railway lines crossing municipal street car rail lines. There were 36 Saskatchewan crossings which were controlled by mechanical <b>interlocking</b> <b>machines</b> between the early 1900s and 1990.|$|R
50|$|The {{carriage}} {{has been}} stripped of asbestos, and the full internal rebuild was abandoned in favour of housing the salvaged parts of the London Underground Victoria Line Cobourg Street signalling centre, {{and much of the}} former Brixton <b>interlocking</b> <b>machine</b> room equipment. The Cobourg Street equipment is now partially working, with work ongoing to allow simulated train movements to be displayed.|$|R
50|$|Alton Junction was {{controlled}} by a manned interlocking tower until 2005 when Amtrak transferred control to its new Chicago Terminal control center. Known as 21st Street tower, its operators handled movements through the busy plant using a US&S Model 14 electro-pneumatic <b>interlocking</b> <b>machine.</b> In its final years 21st St took remote control of the closed Amtrak Clara St tower in New Orleans. In 2006 the closed brick tower was demolished.|$|R
25|$|The LB {{was using}} {{primitive}} interlocking between signals at some junctions by 1844. In 1856, John Saxby, an LB carpenter, patented {{a form of}} <b>manual</b> <b>interlocking</b> of the points and signals, first tried at Bricklayers' Arms that year. The first fully interlocking frame was installed by Saxby at Keymer Junction near Haywards Heath in 1860, where he built a small workshop to undertake private work. He left the company and in 1862 formed Saxby & Farmer signalling contractors. Thereafter the LB patronised Saxby & Farmer {{for most of its}} signalling until circa 1880.|$|R
50|$|The {{elevated}} {{signal cabin}} is a rectangular timber structure three storeys high. It has a gabled roof clad in corrugated iron sheeting with a timber finial at each end. The cabin houses a 55-lever T-bar <b>interlocking</b> <b>machine</b> by MacKenzie and Holland. The top level houses the signal levers and good visibility is {{provided for the}} signalman by banks of windows to each side. The machinery to which the levers are connected is below and single windows light the two lower levels.|$|R
50|$|Non <b>interlocked</b> <b>manual</b> blocks: For safety reasons, non-interlocked manual blocks {{are used}} only on double track.|$|R
50|$|Power {{interlockings}} {{may also}} use mechanical locking {{to ensure the}} proper sequencing of levers, but the levers are considerably smaller as they themselves do not directly control the field devices. If the lever is free to move based on the locking bed, contacts on the levers actuate the switches and signals which are operated electrically or electro-pneumatically. Before a control lever may be moved into a position which would release other levers, an indication must be received from the field element that it has actually moved into the position requested. The locking bed shown is for a GRS power <b>interlocking</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{adjacent}} signal {{boxes are}} at Par railway station to the east, and at Roskear Junction, Camborne, to the west. The Falmouth branch is operated under authority from tokens which {{are kept in}} <b>interlocked</b> <b>machines</b> on platform 3 and at Falmouth Docks railway station. In May 2009 the branch was resignalled and a loop installed at [...] which is controlled from the signal box at Truro. At {{the same time a}} new signal (number TR26) was placed at the west end of the eastbound platform to allow trains to reverse back to Penzance or Falmouth without shunting across to another platform.|$|R
5000|$|The section from Liskeard to Coombe is {{operated}} {{under the authority}} of a Tyers No. 9 Electric Token System. This consists of a pair of electrically <b>interlocked</b> <b>machines,</b> one at Liskeard signal box and the other located by the Coombe No. 1 Ground Frame. The pair of machines only allow one token to be removed from either machine at any one time. However, the system has been modified to allow the token to be removed from and returned to the machine at Liskeard, something that normally requires the breaking of a seal and explanatory entry in the train register.|$|R
2500|$|The {{second floor}} {{contains}} the tower's <b>interlocking</b> <b>machine,</b> {{used to control}} signals and switches. The Union Switch & Signal Model 14 machine contains many steel bars that interlock with one another to prevent conflicts and sudden changes that could cause a derailment The machine is [...] long, [...] wide and [...] tall. The front has 113levers which were used to control all of the switches and signals in Harris Tower's territory. A [...] tall model board is mounted above the machine. More than 450indicator lamps of the model board show the current position of switches, locations of trains within the interlocking limits, and whether the overhead electric catenary is energized.|$|R
25|$|On July 24, 1992, the Harrisburg {{chapter of}} the National Railway Historical Society {{purchased}} Harris Tower from Amtrak. The chapter opened the tower {{to the public as}} a museum, as well as allow visitors to operate the <b>interlocking</b> <b>machine.</b> Instead of controlling a network of signals and switches, it is connected to a computer which simulates train movements through the interlocking. The simulation uses Pennsylvania Railroad timetables from the early 1940s when the rail traffic at the tower was busiest. The tower is popular with railfans as an observation point for the numerous Amtrak and Norfolk Southern trains that regularly pass it. The tower was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 30, 1994.|$|R

50|$|Oban {{tower was}} a {{requirement}} for the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway when it wanted to cross the existing CPR rail tracks. (The Canadian Northern Railway was amalgamated with the Grand Trunk Railway by the Dominion Government to form the Canadian National Railways in 1919.) Oban tower consisted of a 16-frame <b>interlocking</b> <b>machine.</b> There were levers attached to pipes and cranks which controlled semaphore signals and train derails. If an approaching train did not react to the signals at the crossing, the derails were utilized, causing a minor accident and averting a major collision. The signals would be operated 1750 ft and 1200 ft along the railway track. At 55 ft the derail would be set if the train could not stop before the intersection.|$|R

50|$|At the Sydney International Exhibition in Sydney in 1880, Arthur Orpen Herbert, the Commissioner for Queensland Railway, was {{impressed}} by a display of McKenzie and Holland <b>interlocking</b> <b>machines.</b> The New South Wales Government bought the equipment on display, using {{it for the first}} installation in Australia. Queensland ordered the same equipment for Roma Street and Ipswich stations and this arrived in October 1881. Although the interlocking mechanism was a major factor in ensuring safety at busy stations, traffic on much of Queensland's railway lines was insufficient to warrant the installation of the expensive machinery required and most lines obtained safeworking by staff and ticket or a similar system. The fact that the only mechanism installed in Queensland outside Brisbane was at Ipswich suggests a high level of traffic at Ipswich and its importance as a railway centre.|$|R
50|$|What made CTC {{machines}} {{different from}} standard <b>interlocking</b> <b>machines</b> and ABS {{was that the}} vital interlocking hardware was located at the remote location and the CTC machine only displayed track state and sent commands to the remote locations. A command to display a signal would require the remote interlocking to set the flow of traffic and check for a clear route through the interlocking. If a command could not be carried out due to the interlocking logic, the display would not change on the CTC machine. This system provided the same degree flexibility that the manual traffic control has before it, but without the cost and complexity associated with providing a manned operator {{at the end of}} every route segment. This was especially true for lightly used lines that could never hope to justify so much overhead.|$|R
50|$|The Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad {{operated}} {{an extensive}} number of interlocking tower system on its system. From the north, towers were as follows: 12th Street tower, 15th Street tower, 16th Street tower, 21st Street tower, 40th Street tower, 47th Street tower, Ford Street tower (59th Street), 74th Street tower, 81st Street tower, Oakdale (later remote controlled by 81st Street), Pullman Junction, South Deering (112th St., later remote controlled from Main Line Drawbridge), Main Line Drawbridge {{and the famous}} State Line tower, which was North America's largest interlocking controlled by strong-arm mechanical levers. Pullman Junction was not a conventional interlocked junction, {{although there was a}} small <b>interlocking</b> <b>machine</b> for the signals protecting the C&WI-BRC junction there. The crossings were protected by gates and tilting targets. All trains were required to stop. Switchtenders were located at Dearborn Station, 31st Street, 80th Street and Pullman Junction.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of some films, {{such as the world}} premiere {{engagement}} of Carousel, which was made in CinemaScope 55, a six-track soundtrack could not be accommodated on the film, so the sound was played on an <b>interlocking</b> tape <b>machine.</b> The general release of the film did use the standard four-track stereo soundtrack, printed alongside the visual image on the film.|$|R
5000|$|At the International Exhibition in Sydney in 1880, Arthur Orpen Herbert, the Commissioner for Queensland Railway, was {{impressed}} by a display of McKenzie and Holland <b>interlocking</b> <b>machines.</b> Queensland ordered equipment for Roma Street and Ipswich stations and this arrived in October 1881. Charters Towers initially needed a complex interlocking system because of its gradient, and the system of tram tracks that used {{to run to the}} station from various mine sites. A number of dead-end lines or [...] "traps" [...] were necessary as [...] "roll away" [...] protection for loose wagons. Although 169 Queensland railway stations had interlocking by 1918, mechanical interlocking technology eventually became obsolete, as electrical interlocking or electro- pneumatic systems replaced it. Centralised Traffic Control (CTC) signalling systems now control most of the network. This is an electronic version of interlocking where the signals and points controlling movement, and the allocation of a block of track to a particular train, are operated from a remote location by computer.|$|R
40|$|Meld {{scheduling}} melds the schedules {{of neighboring}} scheduling regions to respect latencies of operations issued in one region but completing after control transfers to the other. In contrast, conventional schedulers ignore latency constraints from other regions leading to potentially avoidable stalls in an <b>interlocked</b> (superscalar) <b>machine</b> or incorrect schedules for non-interlocked (VLIW) machines. Alternatively, schedulers that conservatively require all operations to complete before the branch takes effect produce inefficient schedules...|$|R
