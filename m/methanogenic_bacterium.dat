The two strains were identical in appearance and nutritional requirements and resembled Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum. MT 1 had an extraordinary requirement for sulfide. At sulfide levels below 0. 1 mM, growth was poor and the methane production rate decreased. Other sources of sulfur, such as cysteine, sulfate, or thiosulfate, could not replace sulfide.

50|$|The H2S gas percolates upwards and {{reacts with}} Fe2+ and {{precipitates}} pyrite, {{acting as a}} trap for the toxic H2S gas. However, H2S is still a large fraction of emissions from wetland soils. In most freshwater wetlands there is little sulfate (SO42−) so methanogenesis becomes the dominant form of decomposition by <b>methanogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> only when sulfate is depleted. Acetate, a compound that is a byproduct of fermenting cellulose is split by <b>methanogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> to produce methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which are released to the atmosphere.

40|$|When {{microorganisms}} eluted from upper Hudson River sediment were cultured {{without any}} substrate except polychlorobiphenyl (PCB) -free Hudson River sediment, methane formation was the terminal {{step of the}} anaerobic food chain. In sediments containing Aroclor 1242, addition of eubacterium-inhibiting antibiotics, which should have directly inhibited fermentative bacteria and thereby should have indirectly inhibited methanogens, resulted in no dechlorination activity or methane production. However, when substrates for <b>methanogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> were provided along with the antibiotics (to free the methanogens from dependence on eubacteria), concomitant methane production and dechlorination of PCBs were observed. The dechlorination of Aroclor 1242 was from the para positions, a pattern distinctly different from, and more limited than, the pattern observed with untreated or pasteurized inocula. Both methane production and dechlorination in cultures amended with antibiotics plus methanogenic substrates were inhibited by 2 -bromoethanesulfonic acid. These {{results suggest that the}} <b>methanogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> are among the physiological groups capable of anaerobic dechlorination of PCBs, but that the dechlorination observed with <b>methanogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> is less extensive than the dechlorination observed with more complex anaerobic consortia...|$|R

Ethane production was stimulated by addition of ethylthioethanesulfonic acid, and production from ethylthioethanesulfonic acid was blocked by 2 -bromoethanesulfonic acid. A highly purified enrichment culture of a <b>methanogenic</b> <b>bacterium</b> obtained from sediments produced traces of ethane from ethylthioethanesulfonic acid.

Other nucleoside triphosphates could be hydrolyzed. N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide inhibited ATP hydrolysis.

40|$|<b>Methanogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> with a {{coccobacillus}} morphology {{similar to}} Methanobrevibacter ruminantium were {{isolated from the}} bovine rumen. One isolate, 10 - 16 B, represented a previously undescribed rumen population that, unlike M. ruminantium, synthesized coenzyme M, grew rapidly (mu = 0. 24 h- 1) on H 2 -CO 2 in a complex medium, had simple nutritional requirements, and metabolized formate at reported rumen concentrations. H 2 was metabolized to partial pressures 10 -fold lower than those reported for the rumen. After H 2 starvation for 26 h, strain 10 - 16 B rapidly resumed growth when H 2 was made available. The minimum concentrations of acetate (6 mM) and ammonia (less than 7 mM) that were required for optimal growth were lower than the reported acetate and ammonia concentrations in the rumen. Isoleucine and leucine stimulated growth, but only at concentrations (greater than 50 microM) higher than those reported for the rumen. Another coccobacillary methanogenic organism that synthesized coenzyme M was isolated from a different animal as were organisms that required an exogenous supply of coenzyme M. In general, <b>methanogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> that required an exogenous supply of coenzyme M had lower maximum growth rates and more complex nutritional requirements than organisms that synthesized the cofactor. The ability of all isolates to metabolize formate below the detection limit of 10 microM indicated that, in contrast to previous reports, <b>methanogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{have the potential to}} directly metabolize formate in the rumen.

Approximately 27 % of the 7 -methylpterin and the guanine present in the cell was derived from the fed [15 N]glycine. [U-methyl- 2 H]methionine was incorporated with the initial retention of all three deuteriums.

40|$|Hydrogen {{produced}} during colonic fermentation may be excreted, or removed by H 2 consuming <b>bacteria</b> such as <b>methanogenic</b> and sulphate reducing bacteria. In vitro, sulphate reducing <b>bacteria</b> compete with <b>methanogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> for hydrogen when sulphate is present.

Six methane excreting volunteers were fed a low sulphate diet (1. 6 mmol/d) for 34 days {{with the addition of}} 15 mmol sodium sulphate from days 11 - 20. Breath methane was measured and viable counts and metabolic activities of <b>methanogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> and sulphate reducing bacteria determined in faeces. Whole gut transit time and daily stool weight were also measured. When sulphate was added to the diet, breath methane excretion decreased in three of the subjects while faecal sulphate reduction rates rose from 7. 5 (0. 5) to 20. 3 (4. 3) nmol SO 4 reduced/h/g faeces. Sulphate reducing bacteria, which were not detected during the control diet, were found and viable counts of <b>methanogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> fell from 10 (7) - 10 (9) /g faeces to 10 (6) /g. Methanogenic counts and breath CH 4 recovered after sulphate addition was stopped. No change was found in the other three subjects.

40|$|An {{examination}} of the methanofurans isolated {{from a wide range}} of <b>methanogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> and from Archaeoglobus fulgidus has revealed at least five chromatographically distinct methanofurans.

This was supported by the structural elucidation of the methanofuran isolated from Methanobrevibacter smithii, designated methanofuran-c, which was the same as the originally characterized methanofuran except for a hydroxy group at the 2 position of the 4, 5 -dicarboxyoctanedioic acid moiety of the molecule...|$|R
