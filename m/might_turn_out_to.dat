5|$|Even {{before the}} Hanford Site {{started up the}} B Reactor, {{the first of its}} three reactors, on September 15, 1944, Wheeler had been {{concerned}} that some nuclear fission products <b>might</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be nuclear poisons, the accumulation of which would impede the ongoing nuclear chain reaction by absorbing many of the thermal neutrons that were needed to continue a chain reaction. In an April 1942 report, he predicted that this would reduce the reactivity by less than one percent so long as no fission product had a neutron capture cross section of more than 100,000 barns. After the reactor unexpectedly shut down, and then just as unexpectedly restarted about fifteen hours later, he suspected iodine-135, with a half life of 6.6 hours, and its daughter product, xenon-135, which has a half life of 9.2 hours. Xenon-135 turned out to have a neutron capture cross-section of well over 2 million barns. The problem was corrected by adding additional fuel rods to burn out the poison.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognizable}} of all dinosaurs, Stegosaurus has been depicted on film, in cartoons and comics, as children's toys, and was even declared the State Dinosaur of Colorado in 1982. Due to the fragmentary nature of most early Stegosaurus fossil finds, it took many years before reasonably accurate restorations of these animals could be produced. The earliest popular image of Stegosaurus was an engraving produced by A. Tobin for the November 1884 issue of Scientific American, which included the dinosaur amid a speculative Morrison age landscape. Tobin restored the Stegosaurus as bipedal and long-necked, with the plates arranged along the tail and the back covered in spikes. This covering of spikes might {{have been based on}} a misinterpretation of the teeth, which Marsh had noted were oddly shaped, cylindrical, and found scattered, such that he thought they <b>might</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be small dermal spines.|$|E
25|$|Captain James Cook {{made use}} of the journal during his explorations of the region. In 1791 Alessandro Malaspina sailed to Yakutat Bay, Alaska, which was rumoured to be a Passage. In 1790 and 1791 Francisco de Eliza led several {{exploring}} voyages into the Strait of Juan de Fuca, searching for a possible Northwest Passage and finding the Strait of Georgia. To fully explore this new inland sea, an expedition under Dionisio Alcalá Galiano was sent in 1792. He was explicitly ordered to explore all channels that <b>might</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be a Northwest Passage.|$|E

25|$|MacDonald {{had long}} been a leading {{spokesman}} for internationalism in the Labour movement; at first he verged on pacifism. He founded the Union of Democratic Control in early 1914 to promote international socialist aims, but it was overwhelmed by the war. His 1916 book, National Defence, revealed his own long-term vision for peace. Although disappointed at the harsh terms of the Versailles Treaty, he supported the League of Nations – but by 1930 {{he felt that the}} internal cohesion of the British Empire and a strong, independent British defence programme <b>might</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be the wisest British government policy.|$|E

The Mail on Sunday reviewer Sinclair McKay called [...] "The Eleventh Hour" [...] a [...] "deft first episode" [...] that was [...] "packed with one-liners {{and an even}} more fantastical feel than of late. But it had that old reassuring combination of intense Britishness, quirkiness {{and a sense of}} the macabre". He also praised Gillan's [...] "winning" [...] performance and Smith's adaption to the role, concluding, [...] "Smith <b>might</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> {{be one of the best}} Time Lords of the lot". Benji Wilson, for The Daily Telegraph, wrote [...] "It was ridiculous but it felt right: mad, alien, brand-new but very old. A+ to the casting director. A+ to Smith". He also said that Gillan [...] "110 per cent nailed it". Though he compared Prisoner Zero's low-budget CGI makeup to a [...] "draught excluder", he said that Moffat [...] "turned a weakness into a strength" [...] by having Prisoner Zero take the form of humans.|$|E

2500|$|The book's release {{party was}} on May 1, 2011, {{the day before}} the Canadian federal {{election}} of that year, in which Brown was running as the Libertarian Party of Canada candidate for the Trinity-Spadina riding. [...] The election was called early after a motion of no confidence on March 25 resulted in the dissolution of Parliament. [...] "Initially, I was a bit annoyed by the timing of the election," [...] Brown said, [...] "but it <b>might</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be a good thing that I’m getting publicity at this time."

2500|$|The {{payoff matrix}} in Figure 1 {{provides}} a simple two-player, two-strategy {{example of a}} game with two pure Nash equilibria. The strategy pair (Hunt,Hunt) is payoff dominant since payoffs are higher for both players {{compared to the other}} pure NE, (Gather, Gather). On the other hand, (Gather,Gather) risk dominates (Hunt,Hunt) since if uncertainty exists about the other player's action, gathering will provide a higher expected payoff. [...] The game in Figure 1 is a well-known game-theoretic dilemma called stag hunt. [...] The rationale behind it is that communal action (hunting) yields a higher return if all players combine their skills, but if it is unknown whether the other player helps in hunting, gathering <b>might</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be the better individual strategy for food provision, since it does not depend on coordinating with the other player. In addition, gathering alone is preferred to gathering in competition with others. Like the Prisoner's dilemma, it provides a reason why collective action might fail in the absence of credible commitments.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early in}} the war as 1793, a major city {{manufacturer}} and government supporter, Robert Harvey, complained of low order books, languid trade and a doubling of the poor rate. As with many generations of their Norwich forebears, the hungry poor took their complaints on to the streets. Hayes describes a meeting of 200 people in a Norwich public house, at which [...] "Citizen Stanhope" [...] spoke. The gathering [...] " [...] applause at Stanhope's declaration that the Ministers, unless they changed their policy, deserved to have their heads brought to the block; – {{and if there was}} a people still in England, the event <b>might</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be so." [...] Hayes says that [...] "the outbreak of war, in bringing the worsted manufacture almost to a standstill and so plunging the mass of the Norwich weavers into sudden distress made it almost inevitable that a crude appeal to working-class resentment should take the place of a temperate process of education which the earliest reformers had intended." ...|$|E

2500|$|Paleontologists have {{expressed}} concern that the cladistic analysis compared only 30 traits when standard practice is to analyze 200 to 400 traits and to include fossils such as anthropoids from Egypt and the primate genus Eosimias which {{were not included in the}} analysis. This contrasts with the motive openly stated by the authors, which was to list 30 anatomical and morphological characteristics [...] "commonly used" [...] to distinguish extant strepsirrhine and haplorrhine primates. Paleontologist Richard Kay of Duke University thought the data could have been cherry-picked. Paleontologist Callum Ross of the University of Chicago considered the claim that Darwinius should be classified as haplorhine was [...] "unsupportable in light of modern methods of classification." [...] The opinion of Chris Beard, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, was that Darwinius was not a [...] "missing link" [...] between anthropoids and more primitive primates, but that further study of this remarkably complete specimen would be very informative and could reveal relationships amongst [...] "the earliest and least human-like of all known primates, the Eocene adapiforms." [...] In an interview published on 27 May 2009, Jørn Hurum stated that he had an open mind about the possibility that the fossil <b>might</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be a lemur and that a paper on systematics to be published within about a year would mainly focus on the partial counterslab containing the inner ear and the foot bones.|$|E

30|$|An {{additional}} {{issue to}} consider is to match the forecast to recent data, {{it is important that}} it is of good quality.
