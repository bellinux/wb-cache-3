The mica surfaces were prepared either by melt cutting using Pt wire and standard procedures in our laboratories or by tearing sheets (that had not been exposed to Pt) off from a freshly cleaved sheet of mica. AFM micrographs revealed the substantial absence of Pt nanoparticles on the <b>melt</b> <b>cut</b> and torn-off mica surfaces. Normal-force versus surface-separation (D) profiles and shear force versus D measurements for purified water (no added salt), for concentrated aqueous NaCl solutions, and for cyclohexane revealed that in all cases the behavior of the highly confined liquids between melt-cut and between torn-off mica sheets was identical within experimental scatter. These results demonstrate directly that interactions measured between melt-cut mica surfaces as routinely prepared using established procedures in our laboratories and in other laboratories are free of the effect of any Pt contamination...|$|E

25|$|Oxy-acetylene can cut only low- to medium-carbon steels and wrought iron. High-carbon steels are {{difficult}} to <b>cut</b> because the <b>melting</b> point of the slag {{is closer to the}} melting point of the parent metal, so that the slag from the cutting action does not eject as sparks but rather mixes with the clean <b>melt</b> near the <b>cut.</b> This keeps the oxygen from reaching the clean metal and burning it. In the case of cast iron, graphite between the grains and the shape of the grains themselves interfere with the cutting action of the torch. Stainless steels cannot be cut either because the material does not burn readily.|$|R

Life's rules are so solidly instilled in a child they are similar to steel. Steel can be bent, <b>melted,</b> or <b>cut,</b> but when properly used can be a firm and solid support just as the rules, that can be manipulated, are a solid support to the individual. The rules and regulations are the foundations or supports of a human being. Steel is used as the support of several of my sculptures. Within these supports or rules are what man calls the free spirit, but I like to call them pathways. Pathways have the ability to meander {{in and out of a}} support system. Sometimes they are confined within their boundaries. Sometimes the pathway does not have a support, but is structured in such a way it is implicit or self-reliant. A pathway, like life, is a road that can explore new and enchanting lands. It can be straight and narrow, or meander, taking many unpredictable turns. Some pathways split, going separate directions or eventually reunite to continue the journey. Some eventually come back to the beginning making what seems to be an enclosure. (See more in text...|$|R
25|$|The {{beginning}} of the Holocene corresponds with the {{beginning of}} the Mesolithic age in most of Europe around 10,000 years ago. Temperatures rose, probably to levels similar to those today, and forests expanded further. By 8,500 years ago, the rising sea levels caused by the <b>melting</b> glaciers <b>cut</b> Britain off from continental Europe for the last time. The warmer climate changed the Arctic environment to one of pine, birch and alder forest; this less open landscape was less conducive to the large herds of reindeer and horse that had previously sustained humans. Those animals were replaced in people's diets by less social animals such as elk, red deer and aurochs which would have required different hunting techniques in order to be effectively exploited. Tools changed to incorporate barbs which could snag the flesh of a hunted animal, making it harder for it to escape alive. Tiny microliths were developed for hafting onto harpoons and spears. Woodworking tools such as adzes appear in the archaeological record, although some flint blade types remained similar to their Palaeolithic predecessors. The dog was domesticated because of its benefits during hunting (see Star Carr) and the wetland environments created by the warmer weather would have been a rich source of fish and game. It is likely that these environmental changes were accompanied by social changes with the groups that inhabited Britain at this time. Evidence from other parts of Britain suggests that during this period the people were becoming more settled rather than solely nomadic see Howich on the Northumbrian coast, Dunbar in East Lothian, although there is no evidence found in Norfolk to date.|$|R
40|$|Solubility {{profiles}} of uranium dusts in a uranium recycling plant {{were determined by}} performing in vitro solubility tests on breathing zone air samples conducted in all process areas of the processing plant. The recycling plant produces high density shields, closed end tubes that are punch and formed from uranium sheet metal, and high-fired uranium oxide which {{is used as a}} catalyst. The recycled uranium is <b>cut,</b> <b>melted</b> in a vacuum furnace, and part of the molten uranium is poured into molds for further processing. Air samples were taken in process areas under normal working conditions. The dissolution rate of the uranium in a simulant solution of extracellular airway lining fluid (Gamble's solution) was then determined over the next 28 d. Airborne uranium in the oxide section of the plant was found to be highly insoluble with 99 % of the uranium having a dissolution half time in excess of 100 d. The solubility of the airborne uranium {{in other areas of the}} facility was only slightly more soluble with over 90 % of the airborne uranium having dissolution half-times in excess of 90 days...|$|R
60|$|But what, {{it may be}} said by the reader, {{is the use of}} {{the works}} of Giotto to us? They may indeed have been {{wonderful}} for their time, and of infinite use in that time; but since, after Giotto, came Leonardo and Correggio, what is the use of going back to the ruder art, and republishing it in the year 1854? Why should we fret ourselves to dig down to the root of the tree, when we may at once enjoy its fruit and foliage? I answer, first, that in all matters relating to human intellect, it is a great thing to have hold of the root: that at least we ought to see it, and taste it, and handle it; for it often happens that the root is wholesome when the leaves, however fair, are useless or poisonous. In nine cases out of ten, the first expression of an idea is the most valuable: the idea may afterward be polished and softened, and made more attractive to the general eye; but the first expression of it has a freshness and brightness, like the flash of a native crystal compared to the lustre of glass that has been <b>melted</b> and <b>cut.</b> And in the second place, we ought to measure the value of art less by its executive than by its moral power. Giotto was not indeed one of the most accomplished painters, but {{he was one of the}} greatest men, who ever lived. He was the first master of his time, in architecture as well as in painting; he was the friend of Dante, and the undisputed interpreter of religious truth, by means of painting, over the whole of Italy. The works of such a man may not be the best to set before children in order to teach them drawing; but they assuredly should be studied with the greatest care by all who are interested in the history of the human mind.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPlasma {{arc cutting}} (PAC) is a thermal cutting process that {{makes use of}} a {{constricted}} jet of high-temperature plasma gas to <b>melt</b> and separate (<b>cut)</b> metal [2]. In this study 12 mm plate thickness Hardox- 400 has been cut by high tolerance voltage, cutting speed, and plasma gas flow rate included as main parameters in the analysis and their effect on unevenness of cut surface is evaluated. The design of experiments (DoE) techniques is used in order to outline the main parameters which define the geometry of the cut profile, {{as well as its}} constancy for Hardox- 400 material plate. Despite the value selected for these parameters, the analysis shows that Hardox- 400 plates can have different profiles, depending on the specific side considered. Unevenness can be obtained {{as a result of an}} experimental investigation aimed at selecting the proper values of process parameters of PAC system. Results of this screening step are analyzed by means of the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) technique with use of design expert 8. 0. 7. 1 software in order to clearly identify the main parameters, which define the unevenness quality attribute. The operating conditions have been carefully optimized through parameters adjustment like cutting speed, plasma gas and arc voltage in order to obtain good surface quality for all the sides of Hardox- 400 plate...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{arc welding}} {{processes}} {{are difficult to}} use to join thin sheet magnesium alloy because {{of the necessity of}} high energy input, which in turn leads to various problems such as burn through and distortion. Alternatively, laser welding can resolve these problems because of lower heat input and smaller spot size compared to conventional welding. Even when using laser welding, it is difficult to weld thin magnesium sheets with a thickness of less than 1 mm; <b>cut,</b> <b>melt</b> through and cracks tend to occur due to the evaporation of molten metal and high solidification rate. In this study, an attempt has been made to lap fillet welding of thin sheet magnesium alloy AZ 31 B with a thickness of 0. 3 mm using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser beam in a conduction mode. This paper investigates the occurrence of defects in the lap fillet joint of AZ 31 B magnesium alloys. Defects such as void and cracks were observed at the weld root. A void at the root occurred because of lack of fusion due to insufficient melting of the lower sheet. The void was reduced by grinding the metal surface to eliminate the oxide layer. Cracks generated in large grain areas initiated from the void at the root. A higher scan speed significantly improves the defect behaviour because of generating a narrow large grain area and wider fine grain area. Macropore-free weld was obtained in this laser welding research, and smaller amount of micropores than the base metal can be attained...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{understanding}} of melt flow dynamics during fusion laser cutting {{is still a}} topic of great importance because this determines the quality characteristics of the processed workpiece. Despite {{the complexity of the}} experimental study of the physical processes involved in this technique, fusion laser cutting can be visualized during the processing of glass because this material absorbs the laser radiation provided by a CO 2 laser but shows transparency to the visible radiation. Then, we present in this work {{the results of the study}} of the melt flow dynamics during laser cutting of glass. For different experimental conditions, the dynamics of the cutting front and its complete geometry (front wall inclination), and the evolution of the <b>melt</b> along the <b>cut</b> edge have been analysed by using a high speed video camera to study the process. It was found a phenomena no previously reported in the literature concerning to the ability of the plasma plume formed during the process. This can displace the normal shock wave (MSD) commonly formed in the inlet kerf being and can affect to the assist gas flow into the kerf. On the other hand, the analysis of the recorded images allows determining the amount of molten material along the cut edge but also the direction and the velocity of the melt. Relevant processing parameters affecting to the flow of molten material were assessed. These results are used as a basis to explain the different processes involved in the generation of dross, a typical imperfection appeared in laser cutting...|$|R
50|$|At 14:15 {{hours on}} Wednesday 13 March 1991 {{there was a}} major crash on the M4 Motorway in the southernmost part of Lambourn between the Membury Service Station and Junction 14 on the {{eastbound}} carriageway. A van driver fell asleep at the wheel and stopped alongside the central crash barrier on the right hand (overtaking) lane. This obstruction was seen by the car behind him, which managed to change lanes and avoid contact. However, the cars behind were travelling at high speed (an average of 70 mph) in patchy fog and many were only one or two car lengths behind the vehicle in front. As a result, they had no time to avoid the van, crashed and spun out of control into the other lanes. Others took evasive action by driving onto the hard shoulder and up the sides of the cutting. These were followed by articulated lorries, one of which jack-knifed sideways across all three lanes of the motorway. One driver—Mr Alan Bateman—managed to free himself from his car and ran back down the central reservation to warn others, but was ignored and was even hooted by some drivers as they continued towards the crash. The crash included 51 vehicles and lasted 19 seconds, car fuel was ignited along with the combustible material being carried in one of the vans and the eastbound motorway was closed for four days as the <b>melted</b> wreckage was <b>cut</b> away and the tarmac replaced. Ten people were killed and twenty-five were injured, and there were three minor crashes caused by distracted drivers {{on the other side of}} the motorway. In Parliament Sir Michael McNair-Wilson MP asked why the Thames Valley and Wiltshire Police Forces had not turned on the motorway warning lights to warn drivers of the fog, but the Secretary of State for Transport, Christopher Chope, stated that these were only used for hazards not readily apparent to drivers and not adverse weather conditions. The crash led to warning lights being used to warn drivers of fog on British motorways.|$|R
50|$|Once, {{while playing}} {{on the bank of}} the river, Chandrahasa found a uniquely shaped black round stone which was like a big marble. He picked it up and showed it to a learned priest and asked what was it. The priest {{wondered}} that it was a Nrisinha Murthy Shaligrama (Sign-Stone of Lord Vishnu) which was very rare, auspicious and very beneficial for the person who finds it and worships it. The priest guided Chandrahasa how to pray and worship the Shaligrama. Dushtabuddhi (literally one with an evil mind), minister of the king of Kuntala performed Annasantarpane, feeding of people. This boy also went there. The priests who had gathered there noticed the royal features of this boy and told the minister to take special care of the boy. But Dushtabuddhi had other evil designs as the king had no issues and the minister had plans of assuming the throne. In order to get rid of the boy he got some Chandalas and ordered them to kill this boy, promising them suitable gifts. They took the boy to the forest to kill him. Before killing, they asked him his last wish. Chandrahasa said that for the last time he would pray and worship the Shaligrama, which he used to keep always with him. He prayed and then asked the Chandalas why they wanted to kill him. However, Chandalas kept quiet. All of a sudden, all the Chandalas heard the roaring sound of a lion behind each of them and saw a lion jumping on them. Out of fear, they fainted. Chndrahasa helped them and gave them water to drink. Due to the fear of the lion-sight and behaviour of Chandrahasa, their heart <b>melted</b> and they <b>cut</b> off only the sixth finger and showed it to Dushtabuddhi as a proof of killing Chandrahasa. (Note: the inauspicious sign of the boy was thus removed). Kulinda, king of the forest dwelling tribes saw this boy wandering and crying in the jungle, and as he had no issues of his own,brought him home and started bringing him up. Chandrahasa learnt all the aspects of education and won over all the provinces surrounding his kingdom, also added riches to the treasury. Once, when Dushtabuddhi visited their kingdom he recognized him and, having learnt the details from Kulinda, wrote a note to his son to poison him and sent the note to his son through Chandrahasa.|$|R
40|$|A laser {{drilling}} research team was formed {{from members of}} academia, industry and national laboratory to explore the feasibility of using modern high-powered lasers to drill and complete oil and gas wells. The one-year Phase 1 study discussed in this report had the goals of quantifying the amount of pulsed infrared laser energy needed to spall and melt rock of varying lithologies and to investigate the possibility of accomplishing the same task in water under atmospheric conditions. Previous work by some members of this team determined that continuous wave lasers of varying wavelengths have more than enough power to <b>cut,</b> <b>melt</b> and vaporize rock. Samples of sandstone, limestone, and shale were prepared for laser beam interaction with a 1. 6 kW pulsed Nd:YAG laser beam {{to determine how the}} beam's size, power, repetition rate, pulse width, exposure time and energy can affect the amount of energy transferred to the rock for the purposes of spallation, melting and vaporization. The purpose of the laser rock interaction experiment was to determine the threshold parameters required to remove a maximum rock volume from the samples while minimizing energy input. Absorption of radiant energy from the laser beam gives rise to the thermal energy transfer required for the destruction and removal of the rock matrix. Results from the tests indicate that each rock type has a set of optimal laser parameters to minimize specific energy (SE) values as observed in a set of linear track and spot tests. In addition, it was observed that the rates of heat diffusion in rocks are easily and quickly overrun by absorbed energy transfer rates from the laser beam to the rock. As absorbed energy outpaces heat diffusion by the rock matrix, local temperatures can rise to the melting points of the minerals and quickly increase observed SE values. The lowest SE values are obtained in the spalling zone just prior to the onset of mineral melt. The current study determined that using pulsed lasers could accomplish removing material from rock more efficiently than continuous wave lasers. The study also determined that reducing the effect of secondary energy absorbing mechanisms resulted in lower energy requirements in shale and, to some extent, in sandstones. These secondary mechanisms are defined as physical processes that divert beam energy from directly removing rock, and may include thermally-induced phase behavior changes of rock minerals (i. e., melting, vaporization, and dissociation) and fractures created by thermal expansion. Limestone is spalled by a different mechanism and {{does not seem to be}} as affected by secondary mechanisms. It was also shown that the efficiency of the cutting mechanism improved by saturating porous rock samples with water, and that a laser beam injected directly through a water layer at a sandstone sample was able to spall and melt the sample...|$|R
5000|$|In 1932, {{the first}} of Randlev settlement's three silver hoards was {{discovered}} by a local farmer as he plowed his fields. Though the precise location of the find was not documented, the hoard is clearly connected to the settlement. It consists of 237 silver Arab coins, which had been wrapped in birch bark and buried in a clay vessel. Similar caches of Arabic coins, which provide compelling evidence for contact between Vikings and the Arabic world, have been found throughout Denmark at other sites. The coins found in the Randlev hoard were determined based on design to have originated specifically from modern-day Uzbekistan, Caucasus, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Iran. Other coins {{seem to have been}} imitations of these Arabic coins that were produced in Russia, likely because Arabic and Viking traders often met on Russia's Volga River. The youngest coin from the hoard dates from 910 B.C.E./11 A.D., during which time the Vikings traded often with the eastern Arab empire. Silver was valued by weight, and therefore many imported coins such as the ones discovered in the hoard would have been <b>melted</b> down or <b>cut</b> to alter their value. Cut coins and plate are considered hacksilver. [...] The dates supplied by the coins aided in precise dating of both the site and cemetery. The subsequent discovery of six additional Arab coins in a recently excavated pithouse has led to speculation that the two coin finds are somehow connected. A second silver cache, considered to be unassociated with the first, was found approximately 25 meters to the west during the 1990s excavations. It contained jewelry, silver bars, hack silver, and approximately 20 coins, although the objects were somewhat scattered due to soil disturbance from farming activity. Nearby, a silver cup with a sturdy handle was discovered. It dates definitively to the Early Roman Iron Age; it was likely produced in the first or second century A.D. Goblets such as this were a luxury good in Denmark; they were among the first extravagant items to be imported to the north from the Roman Empire. The cup discovered at Randlev is unique, one of only a few ever discovered in Scandinavia. The third and final silver hoard was discovered {{with the use of a}} metal detector near the edge of a large pit. The silver was not found in the form of intact coins, but rather as “hacksilver”—coins that were cut in order to decrease their value and make exchange transactions more precise. In addition, the cache contained four cuttings of silver plate. Though likely used as a form of currency, the silver found in this pit could also have been intended for melting down and reworking.|$|R
40|$|A tool makes a cut {{perpendicular}} to the cylindrical axis of a core hole at a predetermined depth to free the core at that depth. The tool does not damage the surrounding material from which the core was cut, and it operates within the core-hole kerf. Coring usually begins with use of a hole saw or a hollow cylindrical abrasive cutting tool to make an annular hole that leaves the core (sometimes called the plug) in place. In this approach to coring as practiced heretofore, the core is removed forcibly in a manner chosen to shear the core, preferably {{at or near the}} greatest depth of the core hole. Unfortunately, such forcible removal often damages both the core and the surrounding material (see Figure 1). In an alternative prior approach, especially applicable to toxic or fragile material, a core is formed and freed by means of milling operations that generate much material waste. In contrast, the present tool eliminates the damage associated with the hole-saw approach and reduces the extent of milling operations (and, hence, reduces the waste) associated with the milling approach. The present tool (see Figure 2) includes an inner sleeve and an outer sleeve and resembles the hollow cylindrical tool used to cut the core hole. The sleeves are thin enough that this tool fits within the kerf of the core hole. The inner sleeve is attached to a shaft that, in turn, can be attached to a drill motor or handle for turning the tool. This tool also includes a cutting wire attached to the distal ends of both sleeves. The cutting wire is long enough that with sufficient relative rotation of the inner and outer sleeves, the wire can cut {{all the way to the}} center of the core. The tool is inserted in the kerf until its distal end is seated at the full depth. The inner sleeve is then turned. During turning, frictional drag on the outer core pulls the cutting wire into contact with the core. The cutting force of the wire against the core increases with the tension in the wire and, hence, with the frictional drag acting on the outer sleeve. As the wire cuts toward the center of the core, the inner sleeve rotates farther with respect to the outer sleeve. Once the wire has cut to the center of the core, the tool and the core can be removed from the hole. The proper choice of cutting wire depends on the properties of the core material. For a sufficiently soft core material, a nonmetallic monofilament can be used. For a rubber-like core material, a metal wire can be used. For a harder core material, it is necessary to use an abrasive wire, and the efficiency of the tool can be increased greatly by vacuuming away the particles generated during cutting. For a core material that can readily be <b>melted</b> or otherwise <b>cut</b> by use of heat, it could be preferable to use an electrically heated cutting wire. In such a case, electric current can be supplied to the cutting wire, from an electrically isolated source, via rotating contact rings mounted on the sleeves...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{potential}} {{applications for the}} use of microfluidic biochips in molecular diagnostics. Two areas of research that have received considerable attention for integration into microfluidic devices are the stages of DNA amplification and detection, less investigated is that of DNA sample preparation. The focus of the bulk of this research has been on the traditional methods of micromachining in glass and silicon materials. More recently polymers have been investigated as a lower cost alternative. The reports to date of polymeric microfluidic devices have focused on bulk surface machining, or replication techniques. The alternative approach of machining and layering polymer films has shown promise for greater 3 -dimensional structuring and continuous production. It is known that some polymers fluoresce at the wavelengths commonly used for DNA fluorescence detection, reducing the signal to noise ratio. It is also known that the surface charge detrimentally impacts many DNA amplification and detection techniques by the non-specific binding of proteins. There have been few reports of microfluidic biochips fabricated from Poly(ethylene Terephthalate) (PET) for molecular diagnostics. This thesis describes an investigation into a novel method for fabricating a DNA sample preparation biochip by laser machining and the subsequent layering of PET films. A new method of laser micromachining microfluidic structures in PET film using a direct-write 355 nm frequency tripled Nd:YAG (Neodymium-doped Yttrium Aluminium Garnet; Nd:Y 3 Al 5 O 12) laser was investigated, with the results indicating that ablation was dominated by photothermal processes. A reproducible ablation threshold of 2. 0 &# 0177; 0. 3 J/cm 2 and etch rates of up to 25 &# 0956;m per beam pass were achieved. Compression of <b>melt</b> at the <b>cut</b> edge produced channel dimension close to the beam diameter, having a channel width down to 30 &# 0177; 5 &# 0956;m for film thicknesses between 12 - 350 &# 0956;m. During process development it was shown that surface oxidation of the film was important for improving capillary flow, electroosmotic flow, bonding time and quality, and that it detrimentally impacted biocompatibility and fluorescence. The laser machined surfaces had a reduction in the ester component compared to the non machined surfaces. Surface oxidation techniques were developed for improved microfluidic performance and bonding using chemical saponification and UV photooxidation. These produced a change in the contact angle from 75 o for the native PET film down to 16 o and 35 o respectively. However, only UV patterning by non-contact masking enabled localised surface oxidation with features down below 100 &# 0956;m for limiting the impact of surface modification on biocompatibility and fluorescence. To demonstrate the applicability of these techniques polymer microfluidic filtration chips were investigated for leukocyte filtration and particle retention for solid phase extraction. Filter membranes were achieved with pore exit dimensions down to 1 &# 0956;m and porosities up to 50 % with non-supported spans of 1 x 2 mm. Cake-layer formation proved to be an issue during in-line leukocyte filtration causing non-reversible filter fouling and increased backpressures, with back-flushing having limited success only when using surface modified membranes. Stable solid-phase matrices were achieved using irregularly shaped particles (25 - 75 &# 0956;m) resulting in extraction efficiencies of approximately 7 - 14 % with the first elution containing approximately 82 % of the DNA recovered. This thesis concludes that frequency tripled Nd:YAG laser ablation of PET films can be used to produce components of a biochip for molecular diagnostics, namely microfluidics and solid phase extraction of DNA. This new laser machining method of PET film enables the fabrication of microfluidic channels more quickly than excimer based lasers, and with improved feature resolution in comparison to CO 2 lasers. Importantly, the thin film fabrication process can be used for fabricating microfluidic filtration devices entirely from polymers. It was shown that the detrimental impact of the fabrication process on device biocompatibility and fluorescence can be removed by using masking techniques to pattern the oxidised areas...|$|R
