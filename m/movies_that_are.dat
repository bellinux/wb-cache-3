25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action <b>movies</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} half of the 1990s, Mochizuki {{directed}} a series of yakuza <b>movies</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> considered his best work. Some of the films were a collaboration with novelist Yukio Yamanouchi who had once been a legal advisor to one of the yakuza syndicates. The first of the films, Another Lonely Hitman, about an old-time yakuza hitman who ends up battling his own gang, was released in 1995. The movie took the Best Film award at the 5th Japan Film Professional Awards and Mochizuki won the Best Director award. What critics consider his best film appeared in 1997, Onibi or The Fire Within, another study of an aging yakuza trying to go straight. Onibi won the Best Film award at the 19th Yokohama Film Festival and Mochizuki took the festival's Best Director award for this movie and his other 1997 film A Yakuza in Love. These were followed by the 1998 manga-based Mobster's Confession, a comical, cynical account of a small-time gangster and his girlfriend. By this time, Mochizuki had begun to attain an international reputation and the Rotterdam Film Festival held a ten-film retrospective on the director in 1998.|$|E

[...] Discussing the difference between art films and big-studio films, Steven Spielberg referred to Nolan's Dark Knight series {{as an example of}} both; he has described Memento and Inception as [...] "masterworks". Nolan has also been commended by James Cameron, Guillermo del Toro, Matt Reeves, Danny Boyle, Wong Kar-Wai, Steven Soderbergh, Sam Mendes, Werner Herzog, Matthew Vaughn, Paul Thomas Anderson, Paul Greengrass, Rian Johnson, and others.

Those nominations are then used to promote the film. But while the former nominations are announced in December with the awards themselves given in early January, the Academy Award nominations are announced after the Golden Globes, and the actual awards are not given until late February leaving most of the first two months of the year as Oscar season a period during which any Golden Globes received as well as Oscar nominations can be used to promote the film to audiences, while studios lobby Academy members to vote for their nominees.|$|E
500|$|Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} a biopic of Ed Wood when they were students at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Alexander even proposed making a documentary about Wood, The Man in the Angora Sweater in his sophomore year at USC. However, Karaszewski figured, [...] "there would be no one on the planet Earth who would make this movie or want to make this movie, because these aren't the sort of <b>movies</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> made." [...] Irritated at being thought of solely as writers for family films for their work on Problem Child and Problem Child 2, Alexander and Karaszewski wrote a 10-page film treatment for Ed Wood and pitched the idea to Heathers director Michael Lehmann, with whom they attended USC film school. The basis for their treatment came from Rudolph Grey's Nightmare of Ecstasy, a full-length biography, which draws on interviews from Wood's family and colleagues. Lehmann presented their treatment to his producer on Heathers, Denise Di Novi. Di Novi had previously worked with Tim Burton on Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns and The Nightmare Before Christmas, and a deal was struck with Lehmann as director and Burton and Di Novi producing.|$|E

2500|$|Bates said {{on using}} themes and motifs in the score, [...] "Very few <b>movies</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> made {{these days are}} fantastical enough to sustain huge, bold {{identifiable}} themes. Even {{with the majority of}} the comic-book films, they have a tendency to be steeped in a realism that would be disturbed or interrupted by highly emotive, melodic themes, and it seems like {{a lot of the stuff}} going in these films is propulsive and somewhat cold emotionally." [...] He felt that Guardians of the Galaxy did not fit this model, and [...] "unabashedly embraced leitmotifs for the array of cosmic characters" [...] that appear in it. Bates described creating a new main theme for a Marvel franchise as [...] "the most rewarding aspect of stepping into a movie like this". Gunn asked for [...] "something kickass that a 4-year-old would remember", and Bates came up with the theme by [...] "noodling" [...] on an electric guitar. The villain Ronan's theme is quoted in full only once in the film, as Bates and Gunn wanted him to be more serious and scary which they felt would be undermined by a loud, melodic theme. His presence is generally represented with tones [...] "chock full of low-brass" [...] and synths. Bates has [...] "some spongy synthesizers pulsing through" [...] the motif for Groot, which he developed in pre-production. Bates said that he would have infused the score with more of those electronic elements if it was not for the [...] "frenetic working process" [...] on the film.|$|E
