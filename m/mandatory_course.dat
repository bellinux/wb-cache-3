40|$|Abstract. To {{increase}} the retention rate, Georgia Southern University launched the First-Year Experience (FYE) program. FYE {{is a comprehensive}} program which includes two <b>mandatory</b> <b>courses</b> (FYE 1220 : First-Year Seminar, and FYE 1410 : Global Citizens), conversations with professors, intrusive academic advising, giving early alert/midterm grades, and limiting number of withdrawals. The two <b>mandatory</b> <b>courses</b> have been offered since fall 2008. This study is {{to assess the impact}} of the two <b>mandatory</b> <b>courses</b> on academic performance of students majoring in information technology (IT). A comparison is made among the two <b>mandatory</b> <b>courses,</b> two general education courses (English and Math), and two information technology courses. Grade point averages (GPA) and the grades of six courses were extracted from the university data warehouse. Pearson correlation is used to detect the dependence between course grades and GPA. The result shows that the two <b>mandatory</b> <b>courses</b> have higher correlations with GPA than the other courses do. The two IT courses have higher correlations with GPA than the two general education courses do. The first course FYE 1220 is designed with a purpose of facilitating students integrated into academic environment, and the second course FYE 1410 is designed with emphasis of social integration. The result of the strong correlations validated Tinto‟s integration theory, i. e., academic integration and social integration leads to the academic success...|$|R
25|$|During the 2007 provincial election, education, and {{specifically}} {{the funding of}} religious schools, was a central issue. GPO policy calls {{for an end to}} the publicly funded Catholic school system, a merger that it claimed would save millions of dollars in duplicate administrative costs. Other items include giving local school boards a say in funding allocation, ending standardized testing of students, and encouraging programmes such as physical education, environmental education, and a <b>mandatory</b> <b>course</b> in world religions. At the post-secondary level, the GPO proposes a tuition cap of $3 000 per year for university studies and $700 per year for college and increased funding for apprenticeship programmes.|$|E
