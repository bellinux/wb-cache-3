5|$|The {{sound on}} a tonewheel Hammond organ is varied through the {{manipulation}} of drawbars. A drawbar is a metal slider that controls the volume of a particular sound component, {{in a similar way}} to a fader on an audio <b>mixing</b> <b>board.</b> As a drawbar is incrementally pulled out, it increases the volume of its sound. When pushed all the way in, the volume is decreased to zero.|$|E
25|$|In FETs, {{electrons}} can flow {{in either}} direction through the channel when operated in the linear mode. The naming convention of drain terminal and source terminal is somewhat arbitrary, as the devices are typically (but not always) built symmetrically from source to drain. This makes FETs suitable for switching analog signals between paths (multiplexing). With this concept, one can construct a solid-state <b>mixing</b> <b>board,</b> for example.|$|E

500|$|Because {{the mixing}} {{engineers}} {{were aware of}} Timbaland and Furtado's rock influences, the songs were mixed on a <b>mixing</b> <b>board</b> in the studio instead of [...] "the fancy mixer at the end". Furtado said she preferred the louder volume that process gave to the album because she wanted it to sound like her demo tapes, which she prefers to her finished albums.

500|$|In {{spite of}} what he called the [...] "garden-variety lyrics" [...] of the ballad, James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "Halo" [...] was [...] "the most evocative power ballad" [...] {{recorded}} by Beyoncé, comparing it to the work done by American record producer and songwriter Phil Spector on his Wall of Sound <b>mixing</b> <b>board.</b> Critics have highlighted the similarities of [...] "Halo" [...] to Rihanna's [...] "Umbrella" [...] (2007); Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted that [...] "Halo" [...] has the same [...] "icy synths, drivetime rock dynamic, and a similar repetitive chorus". This view was echoed by Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News and Brent DiCrescenzo of Timeout, who viewed [...] "Halo" [...] as a [...] "Bette Midler–level hymn from , lift savior theme". Nick Levine of Digital Spy described [...] "Halo" [...] as a [...] "muscular hybrid" [...] of [...] "Umbrella" [...] and Lewis' [...] "Bleeding Love".

500|$|When Fiasco was 18, {{he began}} {{creating}} {{music as a}} solo artist in his father's basement, even though his parents were not keen on having their son be a rapper. He scoured flea markets and secondhand stores, where {{he was able to}} find an old <b>mixing</b> <b>board</b> and a record player, stacks of vinyl records, and mic stands. [...] At age 19, Fiasco joined a group called Da Pak, which was influenced by other California gangsta rappers such as Spice 1 and Ice Cube. Da Pak signed to Epic Records and released one single before splitting up. Fiasco later described the experience, saying [...] "We had a song out about cocaine, guns, and women, and I would go to a record store and look at it and think, 'What are you doing?' I felt like a hypocrite. I was acting like this rapper who would never be judged, and I had to destroy that guy.

500|$|Bart's voice actor, Nancy Cartwright, {{wrote in}} her {{autobiography}} My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy that the episode's script gives the audience a [...] "visual and aural feast". She said the background designers [...] "must have gone on another field trip for this one" [...] because they captured {{the look of a}} typical musical recording studio. The recording studio in the episode, where Lurleen records her new songs with the Simpson family, features two rooms, one for the artist and one for the engineer, with a pane of glass between them. Cartwright said the designers added their own [...] "special touch" [...] by putting a few cracks on the walls, designing a slightly dilapidated ceiling, and by making it look as if the soundproofing on the walls is falling off. The property designers went on a field trip to Sun Studio to receive inspiration for the props in the recording studio, such as the [...] "in session" [...] red light, the <b>mixing</b> <b>board,</b> the musical instruments, and the volume-unit meters that indicates how loud the artist is singing. For the interior design of the recording studio, the color designers mixed colors such as orange, mauve, gray, and brown to make them complement each other. The colors in the engineer's booth were darker to make Homer's white suit stand out from the background. The appearance of the engineer at the recording studio was based on John Boylan, an American music producer who produced the highly successful album The Simpsons Sing the Blues. Lurleen's mobile home was designed to be [...] "very confined" [...] and [...] "tiny" [...] so that the compositions of Homer and Lurleen would be tighter, thus giving the scene an intimate, romantic feeling.|$|E
30|$|The {{results also}} {{indicated}} that the IB quality of the <b>mixed</b> <b>boards</b> was sufficiently high when MDI binder was used. The IB strengths of C 1, C 2, and C 3 were 1.6, 1.3, and 1.5  MPa, respectively, which are {{much larger than the}} JIS requirement of 0.3  MPa. The mean IB strength for the three <b>mixed</b> <b>boards</b> corresponded to the ratio of S-type particles, which provided high IB strength to S-board. Particle-size mix also more strongly influences the IB strength than does particle density [18, 19]. We also estimated the IB strength of the <b>mixed</b> <b>boards</b> and compared it with the observed IB strengths based on the IB strength of each furnish type. The observed IB strength of <b>mixed</b> <b>boards</b> was higher than the estimated value, but the difference was not significant. This suggests that the properties of mixed PB can be assumed from the properties of each constituent.|$|R

2500|$|Using equalizers, {{frequencies}} {{which are}} too weak, {{such as a}} singer with modest projection in her/his lower register, can be boosted. Frequencies which are too loud, such as a [...] "boomy" [...] sounding bass drum, or an overly resonant dreadnought guitar can be cut. Sound reinforcement systems typically use graphic equalizers with one-third octave frequency centers. [...] These are typically used to equalize output signals going to the main loudspeaker system or the monitor speakers on stage. Parametric equalizers are often built into each channel in mixing consoles, typically for the mid-range frequencies. They are also available as separate rackmount units which can be connected to a <b>mixing</b> <b>board.</b> Parametric equalizers typically use knobs and sometimes buttons. The audio engineer can select which frequency band to cut or boost, and then use additional knobs to cut or boost this frequency range. Parametric equalizers first became popular in the 1970s and have remained the program equalizer of choice for many engineers since then.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{challenge}} with designing sound systems for live music clubs {{is that the}} sound system {{may need to be}} used for both prerecorded music played by DJs and live music. If the sound system is optimized for prerecorded DJ music, then it will not provide the appropriate sound qualities (or mixing equipment and monitoring equipment) needed for live music, and vice versa. A club system designed for DJs needs a DJ mixer and space for record players. Clubs tend to focus on either live music or DJ shows. However, clubs which feature both types of shows may face challenges providing the desired equipment and set-up for both uses. In contrast, a live music club needs a <b>mixing</b> <b>board</b> designed for live sound, an onstage monitor system, and a multicore [...] "snake" [...] cable running from the stage to the mixer. Lastly, live music clubs can be a hostile environment for sound gear, in that the air may be hot, humid, and smoky; in some clubs, keeping racks of power amplifiers cool may be a challenge. Often an air conditioned room just for the amplifiers is utilised.|$|E
2500|$|Before 1966, Brian's {{mastery of}} songwriting proved {{that he was}} capable of {{applying}} odd harmonic progressions, unexpected disruptions of hypermeter, jazz theory, tempo changes, metrical ambiguity, and unusual tone colors successfully within a pop context. He made on-the-spot decisions about notes, articulation, and timbre; composing at the <b>mixing</b> <b>board</b> and using the studio as a musical instrument. Through attending Phil Spector's sessions sporadically, Brian learned how to act as a producer for records while being educated on the Wall of Sound process. As his productions advanced, he became recognized for his pop artistry, vocal harmonization, incessant studio perfectionism, forward-thinking song structures, engineering and mixing know-how, and creative multitasking abilities. From then on, Brian received some production advice from Jan Berry. As they collaborated on several hit singles written and produced for other artists, they recorded what would later be regarded the California Sound. Author Irwin Chusid noted Wilson as an [...] "ironic" [...] example of outsider music for perhaps being one of its biggest-selling artists. He explains that Wilson's history of torment, substance abuse, and [...] "loopy" [...] material [...] "certify" [...] him as an outsider artist.|$|E

30|$|The MORs of the <b>mixed</b> <b>boards</b> (C 1, C 2, and C 3) {{were around}} 15  MPa. From Fig.  2, {{it can be}} seen that the <b>mixed</b> <b>boards</b> had higher MOR values than those of made from M-type particles. This implies that by mixing with a higher quality particle, the MOR of M-board can be enhanced. Based on the MOR values of each furnish type, we also {{estimated}} the MOR values of the <b>mixed</b> <b>boards</b> and compared these estimates with the observed MOR values. The observed MORs of <b>mixed</b> <b>boards</b> were similar to the estimated values, suggesting that the properties of a mixed PB can be determined from the properties of each constituent. This is in accordance with the study by Hu et al. [14], which predicted the bending properties of three-layered PB using the rule of mixture. Moya et al. [15] also made similar observations in a study to predict the bending stiffness of hybrid panels. Based on the statistical analysis using t test, bending strength values of the samples had sufficient values suggesting that such waste material can have potential to be used for PB manufacture.|$|R
