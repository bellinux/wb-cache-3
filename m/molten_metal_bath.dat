40|$|The {{process of}} {{continuous}} galvanizing of rolled sheet steel includes immersion into a bath of molten zinc/aluminum alloy. The steel strip is dipped in the molten bath {{through a series}} of driving motors and rollers which control the speed and tension of the strip, with the ability to modify both the amount of coating applied to the steel as well as the thickness and width of the sheet being galvanized. There are three rolls used to guide the steel strip through the <b>molten</b> <b>metal</b> <b>bath.</b> The rolls that operate in the molten Zn/Al are subject to a severely corrosive environment and require frequent changing. The performance of this equipment, the metallic hardware submerged in the molten Zn/Al bath, is the focus of this research. The primary objective of this research is to extend the performance life of the metallic hardware components of molten Zn/Al pot hardware by an order of magnitude. Typical galvanizing operations experience downtimes on the order of every two weeks to change the metallic hardware submerged in the <b>molten</b> <b>metal</b> <b>bath.</b> This is an expensive process for industry which takes upwards of 3 days for a complete turn around to resume normal operation. Each roll bridle consists of a sink, stabilizer, and corrector roll with accompanying bearing components. The cost of the bridle rig with all components is as much as $ 25, 000 dollars just for materials. These inefficiencies are of concern to the steel coating companies and serve as a potential market for many materials suppliers. This research effort served as a bridge between the market potential and industry need to provide an objective analytical and mechanistic approach to the problem of wear and corrosion of <b>molten</b> <b>metal</b> <b>bath</b> hardware in a continuous sheet galvanizing line. The approach of the investigators was to provide a means of testing and analysis that was both expeditious and cost effective. The consortium of researchers from West Virginia University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory developed several test apparatuses that were designed to work in concert so that the process of developing and evaluating new materials and material combinations could be carried out in the most effective manner. ORNL focused on the long-term effects of static and dynamic corrosion on the hardware. Their efforts have yielded corrosion data in terms of mass loss for a large database of materials for immersion times in excess of 6000 hours. In addition, they have developed a new series of alloy, designated ORNL Alloy 4 -x. Several variants of Alloy 4 were tested for corrosion and wear performance. Another effective method for protecting bearing components is through the use of weld overlays or laser cladding. ORNL worked with several project partners to develop a weld overlay process for cladding of 316 L stainless steel with metallic materials that are much more corrosion and wear resistant. This method provides super-alloy performance that is more affordable. WVU was tasked to study wear of the bearing materials along with mechanisms of dross buildup on the roll surface. A small scale screening test apparatus was developed for the purpose quickly evaluating wear performance of candidate superalloys, ceramics, and coatings {{through the use of a}} ball-and-seat testing combination. This combination uses a fraction of the material used in full-scale bearing applications. With this system, WVU has been able to conduct hundreds of tests on various combinations of materials that mimic a wide variety of operating conditions for the galvanizing lines. The small scale wear tester was used to perform both direct correlation to galvanizing line conditions and to act as a screening mechanism for prototype-scale testing at WVU?s airport bearing materials testing facility. In addition, the studies on the effect of contact pressure and velocity on the bearing wear rate lead to the design and subsequent patent application for a fixed-shaft roll design that has the potential for increasing the bearing life by a factor of 2. The prototype-scale bearing test apparatus was donated by one of our project partners and was relocated to the WVU airport hanger at Morgantown Municipal Airport. This test apparatus uses full-scale sleeve and bushing dimensions and is designed to more accurately mimic the galvanizing line conditions. Through the combination of corrosion, wear, and dross buildup testing, as well as material modeling and thermodynamic analysis, the research team has been able to show that an order of magnitude improvement in material performance is a realistic goal...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Metallurgical process generates many solid, gaseous {{and liquid}} wastes. Nowadays when {{environmental}} protection {{is one of}} the most important problems and when pollution limits are very tight as well, problem of the metallurgical wastes is a strategic one. Design/methodology/approach: In present days the metallurgical and foundry plant have to utilize their own wastes, especially these which are the most dangerous and toxic or have to render harm of its and transfer to another industry branch for further utilization. Nowadays the issue of wastes management has the place both in industrial practice and scientific field too. The presented work is a result of such an approach, where a cooperation between scientific and industrial partners gives good economical and ecological results.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the {{development}} of a numerical model to investigate the heat and mass transport in an EAF freeboard. Some of the challenges presently faced by European steelmakers are increasing costs for raw materials and energy, as well as strict environmental policies. These can be addressed by improving the energy efficiency of the EAF steelmaking process by reducing off-gas and cooling losses. This can be achieved by increasing the degree of combustion of CO and H 2 in the furnace freeboard. A better understanding of the mechanisms that cause unwanted emissions during the steelmaking process can also help to develop new methods to reduce pollutants. The long term motivation behind the topic of this thesis is therefore to create a numerical EAF model with which the influence of process innovations on the fluid flow field, energy transport and chemical reactions within the freeboard of an electric arc furnace can be analysed. At this stage, the main objective is to qualitatively investigate the influence of the arc region on the amount of post-combustion within the freeboard. The effect of a change in the foamy slag height on the resulting amount of post-combustion is also investigated. The numerical EAF model represents the power-on/flat-bath stage of the steelmaking process in an exemplary AC electric arc furnace for quasi-steady state heat loss conditions. The AC EAF has a capacity of 100 tons of steel, a transformer rating of 90 MVA and and an inner vessel diameter of 6. 1 m. A simplified time-averaged arc model based on the channel arc model was developed in order to include the influence of the arc region on the conditions within the freeboard. The plasma arcs {{are not part of the}} solution domain, but are represented as segmented cylindrical surfaces extending from each electrode tip to the bath surface. In contrast to previous models, this simplified arc model includes not only the energy input due to the intense thermal radiation, but also the kinetic energy input due to the arc in- and outflow as well as the energy input due to the heating of the entrained furnace atmosphere in the arcs. The graphite electrodes are part of the solution domain, whereby the Joule heating due to the AC current flowing through the electrodes is taken into account. For the energy balance of the solution domain the energy input from the arc region plus the Joule heating in the electrodes represents the electric power input from the secondary circuit. This energy contribution is much smaller than the true electric power input, as it equates the amount needed, in addition to the other energy inflows, to cover the stationary power losses. The discrete ordinates thermal radiation model available in the CFD code ANSYS FLUENT (Version 14. 5) was chosen to model the thermal radiation exchange, whereby the thermal radiation absorption coefficient of the furnace atmosphere is calculated with the weighted-sum-of-grey-gases-model. Species transport with volumetric reactions and the finite-rate/eddy dissipation turbulence chemistry interaction is used to calculate the mass transfer and chemical reactions within the freeboard. The furnace atmosphere is defined to be a mixture of CO, CO 2, H 2 O, N 2 and O 2. The post combustion of CO to CO 2 is simulated according to the gas-shift reaction available for the oxidation of CO in FLUENT. The realizable k-ε model with standard wall functions for the near wall treatment was selected to simulate the turbulent viscous flow. The geometry of the EAF model extends from the uppermost layer of the metal bath to the beginning of the off-gas extraction downstream of the post-combustion gap. The foamy slag is modelled as a solid layer and the top layer of the bath, also considered as a solid, is included. These two layers allow the simulation of downward absorption and redistribution of energy from the arc region, which is reflected by the resulting temperature distribution at the foamy slag layer surface. Burners, lances or injectors are not included at present. The decarburization of the <b>molten</b> <b>metal</b> <b>bath</b> is taken into account by the definition of a homogenous source of CO at the surface of the foamy slag layer. An average value for the graphite electrode consumption is modelled by a corresponding CO source and O 2 sink at the electrode surfaces. Ingress air is defined to enter the freeboard through the slag door, roof gap and electrode gaps and air flows in at the post-combustion gap. It is assumed that a small amount of steam enters the vessel through the electrode gaps due to electrode cooling. The upper vessel, roof, exhaust elbow and exhaust extraction are cooled by water cooled panels. The walls of the lower vessel, balcony and roof delta zone are defined to consist of refractory material and are cooled by natural convection and thermal radiation to the ambient on the outside of the vessel. The results obtained with the numerical EAF model are used to evaluate the influence of the inclusion of the energy input due to the heating and increase in momentum of the furnace atmosphere drawn into and flowing out of the arc region on the conditions within the freeboard. Furthermore, the impact of the arc region flow on the post-combustion of CO to CO 2 in the freeboard for a free-burning arc length of 230 mm is compared to that for a free-burning arc length of only 50 mm. The modelling of the arc region has a large influence on the flow field, temperature distribution and post-combustion. The results show that due to the inclusion of the arc in- and outflow a total increase in the simulated energy input within the vessel of 4. 42 MW results. This is due to the correspondingly higher temperatures and circulation leading to an increase in the post-combustion of CO to CO 2 within the freeboard. The inclusion of the arc in- and outflow should therefore not be neglected in future EAF models. An increased slag height not only protects the cooling panels from the thermal radiation of the arcs. It also leads to a reduction in the interaction between the flow in the arc region and in the freeboard. This in turn reduces the amount of mixing of CO from the slag layer with the ingress air and therefore also the amount of post-combustion in the freeboard. As a result a decrease in the free-burning arc length from 230 mm to 50 mm leads to a reduction in the total energy input within the solution domain of 3. 22 MW. The numerical EAF simulation model developed during this thesis delivers valuable information which helps one to understand the heat and mass transfer processes taking place within the EAF freeboard. Furthermore, several important insights were gained concerning necessary future developments of the model...|$|E
