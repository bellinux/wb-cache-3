40|$|Abstract—In this research, an aerobic {{composting}} {{method is}} studied to reuse organic waste from rubber factory waste as soil fertilizer and {{to study the}} effect of cellulolytic <b>microbial</b> <b>activator</b> (CMA) as the activator in the rubber factory waste composting. The performance of the composting process was monitored {{as a function of}} carbon and organic matter decomposition rate, temperature and moisture content. The results indicate that the rubber factory waste is best composted with water hyacinth and sludge than composted alone. In addition, the CMA is more affective when mixed with the rubber factory waste, water hyacinth and sludge since a good fertilizer is achieved. When adding CMA into the rubber factory waste composted alone, the finished product does not achieve a standard of fertilizer, especially the C/N ratio. Finally, the finished products of composting rubber factory waste and water hyacinth and sludge (both CMA and without CMA), can be an environmental friendly alternative to solve the disposal problems of rubber factory waste. Since the C/N ratio, pH, moisture content, temperature, and nutrients of the finished products are acceptable for agriculture use.

40|$|Endogenous and {{exogenous}} lectins {{have been}} found to activate the prophenoloxidase (proPO) system of the cockroach, Blaberus discoidalis, to the same extent as laminarin, a previously known <b>microbial</b> <b>activator</b> of proPO. The lectins can also further enhance this laminarin activation of the proPO system. Non-lectin proteins did not display any activation properties. The time course of proPO activation was studied after reconstitution of the reaction system using purified lectins, a trypsin-like enzyme, a trypsin inhibitor and partially purified lectin-binding proteins from the cockroach haemolymph. Lectin activation of the proPO system is probably not mediated by the lectin sugar-binding sites, as specific inhibitory sugars failed to abrogate the enhanced effect. The results suggest that alternative binding site(s) on the lectins may be involved in the proPO activation process. Evidence also suggests that several different lectins are involved in the regulation of the proPO system through separate receptors or binding molecules on the haemocytes, and that they exert their effects early in the sequence of events leading to conversion of proPO into its active form, possibly via regulation of serine proteases and protease inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) {{discriminate}} different microbial pathogens and induce T-cell {{responses of}} appropriate effector phenotypes accordingly. Microbial recognition and differentiation are mediated {{in part by}} pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), whereas the development of T-cell effector functions is critically dependent on DC-derived cytokines such as interleukin- 12 (IL- 12) and IL- 10. However, it is not entirely clear to what extent various <b>microbial</b> TLR <b>activators</b> could induce different functional states of DCs that favor different T-cell effector phenotypes. Toward {{a better understanding of}} this issue, we examined IL- 10 and IL- 12 production and T-cell-polarizing potentials of murine bone marrow-derived DCs after stimulation by three <b>microbial</b> TLR <b>activators,</b> namely, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), and zymosan. We found that the three stimuli induced drastically different profiles of IL- 10 and IL- 12 production in DCs. Further, these stimuli differentially conditioned CD 40 -dependent IL- 10 and IL- 12 production by DCs. Finally, LPS-, PGN-, and zymosan-stimulated DCs primed distinct T-cell cytokine profiles. Our results support the notion that microbe-specific information sensed through different TLRs by DCs is linked to differential Th priming through DC-derived cytokines...|$|R
40|$|Interferon (IFN) -inducible {{guanylate}} binding proteins (GBPs) mediate cell-autonomous host {{resistance to}} bacterial pathogens and promote inflammasome activation. The prevailing model postulates {{that these two}} GBP-controlled activities are directly linked through GBP-dependent vacuolar lysis. It was proposed that the rupture of pathogen-containing vacuoles (PVs) by GBPs destroyed the microbial refuge and simultaneously contaminated the host cell cytosol with <b>microbial</b> <b>activators</b> of inflammasomes. Here, we demonstrate that GBP-mediated host resistance and GBP-mediated inflammatory responses can be uncoupled. We show that PVs formed by the rodent pathogen Chlamydia muridarum, so-called inclusions, remain free of GBPs and that C. muridarum is impervious to GBP-mediated restrictions on bacterial growth. Although GBPs neither bind to C. muridarum inclusions nor restrict C. muridarum growth, we find that GBPs promote inflammasome activation in C. muridarum-infected macrophages. We demonstrate that C. muridarum infections induce GBP-dependent pyroptosis through both caspase- 11 -dependent noncanonical and caspase- 1 -dependent canonical inflammasomes. Among canonical inflammasomes, we find that C. muridarum and the human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis activate not only NLRP 3 but also AIM 2. Our data show that GBPs support fast-kinetics processing and secretion of interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) and IL- 18 by the NLRP 3 inflammasome but are dispensable for the secretion of the same cytokines at later times postinfection. Because IFN-γ fails to induce IL- 1 β transcription, GBP-dependent fast-kinetics inflammasome activation can drive the preferential processing of constitutively expressed IL- 18 in IFN-γ-primed macrophages {{in the absence of}} prior Toll-like receptor stimulation. Together, our results reveal that GBPs control the kinetics of inflammasome activation and thereby shape macrophage responses to Chlamydia infections...|$|R
40|$|Typically, pathogen-associated {{molecular}} patterns (PAMPs) {{are considered}} to be conserved throughout classes of microbes and to contribute to general microbial fitness, whereas effectors are species, race, or strain specific and contribute to pathogen virulence. Both types of molecule can trigger plant immunity, designated PAMP-triggered and effector-triggered immunity (PTI and ETI, respectively). However, not all <b>microbial</b> defense <b>activators</b> conform to the common distinction between PAMPs and effectors. For example, some effectors display wide distribution, while some PAMPs are rather narrowly conserved or contribute to pathogen virulence. As effectors may elicit defense responses and PAMPs may be required for virulence, single components cannot exclusively be referred to by one of the two terms. Therefore, we put forward that the distinction between PAMPs and effectors, between PAMP receptors and resistance proteins, and, therefore, also between PTI and ETI, cannot strictly be maintained. Rather, as illustrated by examples provided here, there is a continuum between PTI and ETI. We argue that plant resistance is determined by immune receptors that recognize appropriate ligands to activate defense, the amplitude of which is likely determined by the level required for effective immunit...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study IAA content, nutrient uptake, growth and productivity of maize and peanut in response to application of biofertilizer. The research was conducted in a green house of Cikabayan IPB Farm, Bogor Agriculture University, Darmaga, Bogor, West Java. A completely randomized design was applied in single factor experiment for maize and peanut with 3 replications. The treatments consisted of 4 factors: I. Without fertilizer, II. 100 % biofertilizer (dosage 100 g/pot), III. 100 % inorganic fertilizer, and IV. Combination of biofertilizer and inorganic fertilizer with 50 % dosage. Biofertilizer was applied using compost enriched by Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus sp., Azotobacter sp., Azospirillum sp., Rhizobium sp, and P-solubilising bacteria. The dosage of inorganic fertilizer was 0. 5 g/pot of Urea; 0. 5 g/pot of SP- 36; 0. 375 g/pot of KCl for maize, and 0. 125 g/pot of Urea; 0. 5 g/pot of SP- 36; 0. 375 g/pot of KCl for peanut. Application of biofertilizer enhanced auxin content of maize by 73 - 159 %, but not in peanut. The treatment also increased the uptake of N, P, and K of both plants by 2 to 35 times as compared to control plant. The production increased by 270 % on maize and 66 % on peanut due to application of biofertilizer. The result showed that application of compost enriched by <b>microbial</b> <b>activator</b> was able to supplement inorganic fertilizer for growth and production of maize and peanu...|$|E
40|$|Perspective on the Development of Bio-Activator Compost to Control the Attacks of Phytophthora capsici on Pepper (Piper nigrum). Bio-activator {{microbes}} can {{be found}} enormously in the compost, for instance bacteria (Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp), actinomycetes (Streptomyces spp.) and fungi (Trichoderma spp, Aspergillus spp, Penicillium spp). This research aimed to assess the development of bio-activator in controlling P. capsici and increasing production {{and quality of the}} pepper. Activity was done in the field trials in the upland and lowland as the center of pepper plants in Lampung using a factorial randomized design group with five replications. The first factor was microbial bio-activator formula and the second factor was three doses of compost namely 1, 2 and 3 kg/pepper plants. Each plant was given zeolite, which was 0. 5 kg/tt and fulfat acid 1 % as amount of 200 cc/tt. The study showed that <b>microbial</b> <b>activators</b> significantly suppressed P. capsici attacks and increased the production of pepper. In the uplands, the intensity of P. capsici decreased to 83. 31 %, while in the lowlands, the disease intensity that was caused by P. capsici decreased by 99 - 100 %. The results of chemical and biological analysis of soil showed that the application of bio-activator compost increased the diversity of the types and the amounts of microbes in the rhizosphere as well as increased the nutrient availability. Combination treatment of bio-activator compost from coffee leather of 3 kg/tt were able to suppress the intensity of the disease BPB to more than 50 % and increase the production of more than 30 %. Key words: piper nigrum, bioactivator, coffee skin, Phytophthora capsicii. Di dalam kompos banyak ditemukan mikroba bioaktifator, yaitu bakteri (Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp), aktinomiset (Streptomyces spp.) dan cendawan (Trichoderma spp, Aspergillus spp, Penicillium spp.). Bioaktivator dapat dimanfaatkan untuk mengendalikan serangan P. capsicii dan meningkatkan produksi serta mutu hasil lada. Kegiatan ini bertujuan mengkaji pengembangan bioaktivator untuk pengendalian Phytopthora capsici dan peningkatan produksi serta mutu hasil lada. Pengkajian dilakukan dalam format uji lapangan didataran tinggi dan rendah sentra lokasi tanaman lada di Lampung. Pengkajian menggunakan Rancangan Acak Kelompok pola faktorial dengan lima ulangan. Faktor pertama ialah bentuk formula mikroba bioaktivator dan faktor kedua ialah tiga dosis kompos yaitu 1, 2 dan 3 kg/tanaman lada.
