30|$|As {{one of the}} key {{technologies}} in 5 G, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been proposed and investigated as a mean to improve the spectrum efficiency of the system [2 – 7]. In the downlink of the NOMA scheme, multiple <b>user</b> <b>terminals</b> are assigned the same frequency resources. These <b>user</b> <b>terminals</b> are located at different positions relative to a base station, and their propagation losses are different. The base station transmits signals to these <b>user</b> <b>terminals</b> with different transmission powers. The receiver in the <b>user</b> <b>terminal</b> that is closer to the base station eliminates the signals for the other <b>user</b> <b>terminals</b> by interference cancelation and extracts the desired signal. Under practical modulation and coding parameters that enable limited decoding and interference cancelation capability, the powers of the received signals must be sufficiently different to demodulate and decode the undesired signals through interference cancelation. Otherwise, the residual interference caused by unreliable replica symbols will deteriorate the demodulation performance of the desired signal [8]. The improvement in throughput by the NOMA scheme is limited owing to the residual interference even though the number of terminals assigned the same resource is set to more than two [9].|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we present {{measurements}} that involve two access points (APs) and two <b>user</b> <b>terminals,</b> {{each of which}} is equipped with 4 antennas, in an indoor office environment.

We show that the links between <b>user</b> <b>terminals</b> are impaired by body shadowing, and have therefore much lower gains than the direct links to the APs. Moreover we investigate the statistics of the links, and their correlation. Based on these measurements, we investigate the performance of cooperative relaying in terms of rate improvement (for this analysis the data from only one AP are used). We show that a significant rate improvement can be achieved if the relaying node is free to set the power level at which it transmits, and if it is free to select which of its antennas is used to perform the relaying.
