2500|$|The {{process begins}} with a {{descaling}} and removing soil from the workpiece. This {{can be done in}} the tumbler or in a separate cleaning system. After cleaning, the parts are prepared by combining them with water, medium, and a surface conditioner. The surface conditioner [...] lightly coats the workpiece in copper, while the medium removes any residual <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> or oxides. Finally, accelerators, promoters and metal powder are added to the mix. The accelerators and promoters provide the proper chemical environment for the plating to occur, such as the maintenance of a pH level of 1 to 2 to prevent oxidation and promote adhesion. The medium that is already in the mixture cold welds the metal powder to the workpiece through impacts that are induced by the tumbling action of the tumbler. At this point the surface finish is typically matte to a semi-bright finish, however the finish can be improved with a water polish. The time required for the above process is approximately 50minutes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mill</b> <b>scale</b> is a {{nuisance}} when the steel {{is to be}} processed. Any paint applied over it is wasted, since it will come off with the scale as moisture-laden air gets under it. Thus <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> can be removed from steel surfaces by flame cleaning, pickling, or abrasive blasting, which are all tedious operations that consume energy. This is why shipbuilders and steel fixers used to leave steel and rebar delivered freshly rolled from mills {{out in the open}} to allow it to 'weather' until most of the scale fell off due to atmospheric action. Nowadays most steel mills can supply their produce with <b>mill</b> <b>scale</b> removed and steel coated with shop primers over which welding or painting can be done safely.|$|E

This work examines the action of diethylene triamine penta(methylene phosphonic acid) (DTPMPA), either alone or combined with commercial anti-scaling agents, as an inhibitor of calcium carbonate precipitation in the kraft pulping of Pinus taeda.

40|$|Master's thesis in Industrial economicsScale {{build up}} {{is one of}} the leading reasons for {{production}} decline in oilfields worldwide. Scale can be formed whenever water is produced; either by direct precipitation from the water that occurs naturally in the reservoir rocks, or as a result of produced water becoming oversaturated with scale components when two incompatible waters are mixed downhole. The two most common scales formed in an oilfield are calcium carbonate and barium sulfate. Scale can be found in the reservoir, along the wellbore and in the surface process system. There are various methods for controlling scale. The methods shall either prevent scale formation or remove scale that has already occurred. Scale inhibition and choosing the correct injection fluid are two methods for preventing scale formation. Removal of scale can be divided into chemical dissolution and mechanical removal. For chemical dissolution, the alternative is to bullhead the well with chemicals to remove the scale. Mechanical removal includes the use of different equipment e. g. brushes, broaches, string shots and milling. This thesis focuses especially on mechanical wireline milling for removal of scale. Due to this, the wireline rig-up equipment for both platforms and riserless well intervention vessels, has been presented. Wireline milling is a mechanical method which uses a special tool string with a milling bit in the end, to remove <b>scale.</b> Four <b>scale</b> <b>milling</b> case histories from the Smørbukk field in the Norwegian Sea has been studied. They were all performed from a riserless well intervention vessel. Different plots with measurements from one of the case histories, taken during the milling operation have been looked into. The plots contain different measurements such as head tension, current and wireline tension and are plotted against time. The objective of the thesis has been trying to locate parts of the execution of <b>scale</b> <b>milling</b> operations that can be improved. Some of the key findings were: -	When carrying out a <b>scale</b> <b>milling</b> operation; as much as possible information about the scale, and other well conditions, should be obtained before the <b>scale</b> <b>milling</b> start. This can be information about the scale type, where it is located, and the length and thickness of the scale restrictions. Other important information is temperature, pressure and fluid in the well. This information can make the choice of equipment easier and reduce the risk for something going wrong during the operation. To obtain information about the scale restrictions, a caliper can be run in well. -	The weight on bit should be controlled carefully throughout the milling operation. The correct weight on bit is crucial to avoid stalling out with the bit. The consequence of stalling with the bit is no progress in the <b>scale</b> <b>milling,</b> and maybe the need for pulling out of hole with the tool string. -	The removal of scale cuttings is very important during a milling operation. If the cuttings are not sufficiently removed, there will be an accumulation of cuttings around the mill bit and no progress in the milling. -	Real time measurement taken during the <b>scale</b> <b>milling</b> is important for having optimal control over the operation. -	In wells with challenging well conditions, like high temperature and high pressure, pre-testing of equipment for real well conditions, may be important for optimizing the <b>scale</b> <b>milling</b> operation. This can be a good measure to prevent equipment failures and short circuits during the milling operation and decrease the need for tripping in and out of hole more than planned for. -	The effect that acid has on scale is difficult to conclude based on these case histories and should be further investigated. -	The overall experience from the <b>scale</b> <b>milling</b> operations emphasizes the need for a detailed planning of milling operations. Experience, equipment limitations and the different aspects of a milling operation should be thoroughly addressed before one start to <b>mill</b> the <b>scale.</b> This may help to reduce the number of problems during the milling operation...|$|R
