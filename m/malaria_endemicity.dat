50|$|This article {{describes}} the administration of antimalarial drugs to whole populations an intervention which {{has been used as}} a malaria-control measure for more than 70 years. Recent proposals to eliminate or even to eradicate malaria have led to a renewed interest in mass drug administrations in areas with very high <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity.</b> Drugs have been administered either directly as a full therapeutic course of treatment or indirectly through the fortification of salt. Mass drug administrations were generally unsuccessful in interrupting transmission but, in some cases, had a marked effect on parasite prevalence and on the incidence of clinical malaria. MDAs are likely to encourage the spread of drug-resistant parasites and so have only a limited role in malaria control. They may have a part to play in the management of epidemics and in the control of malaria in areas with a very short transmission season. In order to reduce the risk of spreading drug resistance, MDAs should use more than one drug and, preferably include a drug, such as an artemisinin, which has an effect on gametocytes. MDAs have low acceptance in areas with low <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity.</b>|$|E

40|$|Malaria in the {{highlands}} of Kenya is traditionally regarded as unstable and limited by low temperature.

50|$|The {{administration}} of antimalarials to {{large numbers of}} individuals {{with little or no}} preliminary screening could result in significant toxicity as nearly all antimalarials in common use can occasionally cause serious adverse events.

Few MDA projects have reported specifically on adverse events.

40|$|Background: Many {{studies have}} {{assessed}} {{the level of}} bed net coverage in populations at risk of malaria infection. These revealed large variations in bed net use across countries, regions and social strata. Such studies are often aimed at identifying populations with low access to bed nets that should be prioritized in future interventions. However, often spatial differences in <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity</b> are not taken into account. By ignoring variability in <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity,</b> these studies prioritize populations with little access to bed nets, even if these happen to live in low endemicity areas. Conversely, populations living in regions with high <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity</b> will receive a lower priority once a seizable proportion is protected by bed nets. Adequately assigning priorities requires accounting for both {{the current level of}} bed net coverage and the local <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity.</b> Indeed, as shown here for 23 African countries, there is no correlation between the level of bed net coverage and the level of <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity</b> in a region. Therefore, the need for future interventions can not be assessed based on current bed net coverage alone. This paper proposes the Adjusted Bed net Coverage (ABC) statistic as a measure taking into account both local <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity</b> and the level of bed net coverage. The measure allows setting priorities for future interventions taking into account both local <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity</b> and bed net coverage. Methods. A mathematical formulation of the ABC as a weighted difference of bed net coverage and <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity</b> is presented. The formulation is parameterized based on a model of malaria epidemiology (Smith et al. Trends Parasitol 25 : 511 - 516, 2009). By parameterizing the ABC based on this model, the ABC as used in this paper is proxy for the steady-state malaria burden given the current level of bed net coverage. Data on the bed net coverage in under five year olds and <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity</b> in 23 Sub-Saharan countries is used to show that the ABC prioritizes different populations than the level of bed net coverage by itself. Data from the following countries was used: Angola, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Congo Democratic Republic, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The priority order given by the ABC and the bed net coverage are compared at the countries' level, the first level administrative divisions and for five different wealth quintiles. Results: Both at national level and {{at the level of the}} administrative divisions the ABC suggests a different priority order for selecting countries and divisions for future interventions. When taking into account <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity,</b> measures assessing equality in access to bed nets across wealth quintiles, such as slopes of inequality, are prone to change. This suggests that when assessing inequality in access to bed nets one should take into account the local <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity</b> for populations from different wealth quintiles. Conclusion: Accounting for <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity</b> highlights different countries, regions and socio-economic strata for future intervention than the bed net coverage by itself. Therefore, care should be taken to factor out any effects of local <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity</b> in assessing bed net coverage and in prioritizing populations for further scale-up of bed net coverage. The ABC is proposed as a simple means to do this that is derived from an existing model of malaria epidemiology. © 2013 Vanderelst and Speybroeck; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E

We studied the serologic evidence of <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity</b> at two highland sites along a transmission intensity cline. An improved understanding of the micro-geographic variation in malaria exposure in the highland ecosystems will be relevant in planning effective malaria control. Methods: Total IgG levels to Plasmodium falciparum MSP- 1 19 were measured in an age-stratified cohort (15 years) recorded high and stable immune response in spite of changing seasons. Lower responses were observed in children (≤ 15 years), which, fluctuated with changing seasons particularly in the valley residents. In the uphill population, annual seroconversion rate (SCR) was 8. 3 % and reversion rate was 3. 0 %, with seroprevalence reaching a plateau of 73. 3 % by age of 20. Contrary, in the valley bottom population, the annual SCR was 35. 8 % and the annual seroreversion rate was 3. 5 %, and seroprevalence in the population had reached 91. 2 % by age 10.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the incidence of malaria attacks among mosquito collectors and to compare these results with those of non-collectors in a Senegalese village. From July 1990 to December 2011, a longitudinal malaria study involving mosquito collectors and non-collectors was performed in Dielmo village, Senegal. During the study period, 4 drugs were successively used to treat clinical malaria, and long-lasting insecticide-treated nets were offered to all villagers in July 2008. No malaria chemoprophylaxis was given to mosquito collectors. Incidence of uncomplicated clinical malaria and asymptomatic malaria infection were analyzed among these two groups while controlling for confounding factors associated with malaria risk in random effects negative binomial and logistic regression models, respectively. A total of 3, 812 person-trimester observations of 199 adults at least 15 years of age were analyzed. Clinical malaria attacks accounted for 6. 3 % both in collectors and non-collectors, and asymptomatic malaria infections accounted for 21 % and 20 % in collectors and non-collectors, respectively. A non-significant lower risk of malaria was observed in the collector group in comparison with the non-collector group after adjusting for other risk factors of <b>malaria</b> and <b>endemicity</b> level (Clinical malaria: adjusted incidence rate ratio = 0. 89; 95 % confidence interval = 0. 65 - 1. 22; p= 0. 47).

40|$|Abstract Background The Plasmodium falciparum Erythrocyte Binding Antigen- 175 (EBA- 175) is an antigen {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the leading malaria vaccine candidates. EBA- 175 mediates sialic acid-dependent binding to glycophorin A on the erythrocytes playing a crucial role during invasion of the P. falciparum in the host cell. Dimorphic allele segments, termed C-fragment and F-fragment, have been found in high <b>endemicity</b> <b>malaria</b> areas and associations between the dimorphism and severe malaria have been described. In this study, the genetic dimorphism of EBA- 175 was evaluated in P. falciparum field isolates from Brazilian malaria endemic area. Methods The study was carried out in rural villages situated near Porto Velho, Rondonia State in the Brazilian Amazon in three time points between 1993 and 2008. The allelic dimorphism of the EBA- 175 was analysed by Nested PCR. Results The classical allelic dimorphism of the EBA- 175 was identified in the studied area. Overall, C-fragment was amplified in a higher frequency than F-fragment. The same was observed in the three time points where C-fragment was observed in a higher frequency than F-fragment. Single infections (one fragment amplified) were more frequent than mixed infection (two fragments amplified). Conclusions These findings confirm the dimorphism of EBA 175, since only the two types of fragments were amplified, C-fragment and F-fragment. Also, the results show the remarkable predominance of CAMP allele in the studied area.

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} was to use {{geographic}} information systems in combination with historical maps to quantify the anthropogenic impact {{on the distribution of}} malaria in the 20 th century. The nature of the cartographic record enabled global and regional patterns in the spatial limits of malaria to be investigated at six intervals between 1900 and 2002. Contemporaneous population surfaces also allowed changes in the numbers of people living in areas of malaria risk to be quantified. These data showed that during the past century, despite human activities reducing by half the land area supporting malaria, demographic changes resulted in a 2 billion increase in the total population exposed to malaria risk. Furthermore, stratifying the present day <b>malaria</b> extent by <b>endemicity</b> class and examining regional differences highlighted that nearly 1 billion people are exposed to hypoendemic and mesoendemic malaria in southeast Asia. We further concluded that some distortion in estimates of the regional distribution of malaria burden could have resulted from different methods used to calculate burden in Africa. Crude estimates of the national prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum infection based on endemicity maps corroborate these assertions. Finally, population projections for 2010 were used to investigate the potential effect of future demographic changes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Efficient {{allocation}} of resources to intervene against malaria requires a detailed understanding of the contemporary spatial distribution of malaria risk. It is exactly 40 y since the last global map of <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity</b> was published. This paper describes the generation {{of a new world}} map of Plasmodium falciparum <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity</b> for the year 2007. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 8, 938 P. falciparum parasite rate (PfPR) surveys were identified using a variety of exhaustive search strategies. Of these, 7, 953 passed strict data fidelity tests for inclusion into a global database of PfPR data, age-standardized to 2 - 10 y for endemicity mapping. A model-based geostatistical procedure was used to create a continuous surface of <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity</b> within previously defined stable spatial limits of P. falciparum transmission. These procedures were implemented within a Bayesian statistical framework so that the uncertainty of these predictions could be evaluated robustly. The uncertainty was expressed as the probability of predicting correctly one of three endemicity classes; previously stratified to be an informative guide for malaria control. Population at risk estimates, adjusted for the transmission modifying effects of urbanization in Africa, were then derived with reference to human population surfaces in 2007. Of the 1. 38 billion people at risk of stable P. falciparum malaria, 0. 69 billion were found in Central and South East Asia (CSE Asia), 0. 66 billion in Africa, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia (Africa+), and 0. 04 billion in the Americas. All those exposed to stable risk in the Americas were in the lowest endemicity class (PfPR 2 - 10 5 to or = 40 %) areas. High endemicity was widespread in the Africa+ region, where 0. 35 billion people are at this level of risk. Most of the rest live at intermediate risk (0. 20 billion), with a smaller number (0. 11 billion) at low stable risk. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of P. falciparum <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity</b> are common in Africa. Uniformly low endemic levels are found in the Americas. Low endemicity is also widespread in CSE Asia, but pockets of intermediate and very rarely high transmission remain. There are therefore significant opportunities for malaria control in Africa and for malaria elimination elsewhere.

40|$|Abstract Background Gametocyte {{carriage}} {{is essential}} for <b>malaria</b> transmission and <b>endemicity</b> of disease; thereby it is a target for malaria control strategies. Malaria-infected individuals may harbour gametocytes below the microscopic detection threshold that can be detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting gametocyte-specific mRNA. To date, RT-PCR has mainly been applied to the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes but very limited for that of Plasmodium vivax. Methods A multiplex-nested RT-PCR targeting Pfs 25 and Pvs 25 mRNA specific to mature gametocytes of P. falciparum and P. vivax, respectively, was developed. The assay was evaluated using blood samples collected in rainy and dry seasons from febrile patients,in a malaria-endemic area in Thailand. Malaria diagnosis was performed by Giemsa-stained blood smears and 18 S rRNA PCR. Results The multiplex-nested RT-PCR detected Pfs 25 mRNA in 75 of 86 (87. 2 %) P. falciparum -infected individuals and Pvs 25 mRNA in 82 of 90 (91. 1 %) P. vivax malaria patients diagnosed by 18 S rRNA PCR. Gametocytes were detected in 38 (eight P. falciparum and 30 P. vivax) of 157 microscopy positive samples, implying {{that a large number}} of patients harbour sub-microscopic gametocytaemia. No seasonal differences in gametocyte carriage were observed for both malaria species diagnosed by multiplex-nested RT-PCR. With single-nested RT-PCR targeting Pfs 25 or Pvs 25 mRNA as standard, the multiplex-nested RT-PCR offered sensitivities of 97. 4 % and 98. 9 % and specificities of 100 % and 98. 8 % for diagnosing mature gametocytes of P. falciparum and P. vivax, respectively. The minimum detection limit of the multiplex-nested PCR was 10 copies of templates. Conclusions The multiplex-nested RT-PCR developed herein is useful for simultaneous assessment of both P. falciparum and P. vivax gametocyte carriage that is prevalent and generally sympatric in several malaria-endemic areas outside Africa. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficient}} {{allocation of}} financial resources for malaria control using appropriate combinations of interventions requires accurate {{information on the}} geographic distribution of malaria risk. An evidence-based description of the global range of Plasmodium falciparum <b>malaria</b> and its <b>endemicity</b> has not been assembled in almost 40 y. This paper aims to define the global geographic distribution of P. falciparum malaria in 2007 {{and to provide a}} preliminary description of its transmission intensity within this range. The global spatial distribution of P. falciparum malaria was generated using nationally reported case-incidence data, medical intelligence, and biological rules of transmission exclusion, using temperature and aridity limits informed by the bionomics of dominant Anopheles vector species. A total of 4, 278 spatially unique cross-sectional survey estimates of P. falciparum parasite rates were assembled. Extractions from a population surface showed that 2. 37 billion people lived in areas at any risk of P. falciparum transmission in 2007. Globally, almost 1 billion people lived under unstable, or extremely low, malaria risk. Almost all P. falciparum parasite rates above 50 % were reported in Africa in a latitude band consistent with the distribution of Anopheles gambiae s. s. Conditions of low parasite prevalence were also common in Africa, however. Outside of Africa, P. falciparum malaria prevalence is largely hypoendemic (less than 10 %), with the median below 5 % in the areas surveyed. This new map is a plausible representation of the current extent of P. falciparum risk and the most contemporary summary of the population at risk of P. falciparum malaria within these limits. For 1 billion people at risk of unstable malaria transmission, elimination is epidemiologically feasible, and large areas of Africa are more amenable to control than appreciated previously. The release of this information in the public domain will help focus future resources for P. falciparum malaria control and elimination...|$|R
50|$|Plasmodium vivax is a protozoal {{parasite}} {{transmitted to}} humans through {{the bite of}} infected mosquitoes, and {{is the cause of}} one of the most common forms of malaria. Gametocyte carriage is essential for <b>malaria</b> transmission and <b>endemicity</b> of disease; thereby it is a target for malaria control strategies. Malaria-infected individuals may harbour gametocytes below the microscopic detection threshold that can be detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction targeting gametocyte-specific mRNA. Although it is not one of the most dangerous forms, it affects many people annually, and can be somewhat resistant to drugs that are typically used to treat malaria. Once contracted, it can remain in the liver for years if left untreated with the appropriate medications. Given that the condition often occurs in poorer parts of the world, these medications aren’t always available, and some people continue to suffer from the effects of Plasmodium vivax for years. These infections take their toll on poor countries in other ways because many hospitalizations are due to initial symptoms of malaria and is costly. When people are first affected by plasmodium vivax, they frequently show symptoms of high fever, chills, fatigue and profuse sweating. These symptoms often last for a period of about two to three days, but the process may be complicated if a person has additional illnesses. Other symptoms include vomiting, muscle aches, dizziness or a fever that comes and goes. After this primary infection, the disease can go dormant, but the symptoms may return regularly and other conditions like jaundice can develop because Plasmodium vivax establishes itself in the liver. There is no vaccine for Plasmodium vivax, though people who travel to areas with high malaria incidence may receive treatment for it, which is administration of a 14-day course of the drugs chloroquine and primaquine.|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{allocation}} of resources to intervene against malaria requires a detailed understanding of the contemporary spatial distribution of malaria risk. It is exactly 40 y since the last global map of <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity</b> was published. This paper describes the generation {{of a new world}} map of Plasmodium falciparum <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity</b> for the year 2007. A total of 8, 938 P. falciparum parasite rate (PfPR) surveys were identified using a variety of exhaustive search strategies. Of these, 7, 953 passed strict data fidelity tests for inclusion into a global database of PfPR data, age-standardized to 2 - 10 y for endemicity mapping. A model-based geostatistical procedure was used to create a continuous surface of <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity</b> within previously defined stable spatial limits of P. falciparum transmission. These procedures were implemented within a Bayesian statistical framework so that the uncertainty of these predictions could be evaluated robustly. The uncertainty was expressed as the probability of predicting correctly one of three endemicity classes; previously stratified to be an informative guide for malaria control. Population at risk estimates, adjusted for the transmission modifying effects of urbanization in Africa, were then derived with reference to human population surfaces in 2007. Of the 1. 38 billion people at risk of stable P. falciparum malaria, 0. 69 billion were found in Central and South East Asia (CSE Asia), 0. 66 billion in Africa, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia (Africa+), and 0. 04 billion in the Americas. All those exposed to stable risk in the Americas were in the lowest endemicity class (PfPR 2 - 10 5 to or = 40 %) areas. High endemicity was widespread in the Africa+ region, where 0. 35 billion people are at this level of risk. Most of the rest live at intermediate risk (0. 20 billion), with a smaller number (0. 11 billion) at low stable risk. High levels of P. falciparum <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity</b> are common in Africa. Uniformly low endemic levels are found in the Americas. Low endemicity is also widespread in CSE Asia, but pockets of intermediate and very rarely high transmission remain. There are therefore significant opportunities for malaria control in Africa and for malaria elimination elsewhere. This 2007 global P. falciparum <b>malaria</b> <b>endemicity</b> map is {{the first of a series}} with which it will be possible to monitor and evaluate the progress of this intervention process...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Despite low <b>endemicity,</b> <b>malaria</b> {{remains a}} major health problem {{in urban areas}} where a high {{proportion}} of fevers are presumptively treated using anti-malarial drugs. Low acquired malaria immunity, behaviour of city-dwellers, access to health care and preventive interventions, and heterogenic suitability of urban ecosystems for malaria transmission contribute to the complexity of the malaria epidemiology in urban areas. Methods The study was designed to identify the determinants of malaria transmission estimated by the prevalence of anti-circumsporozoite (CSP) antibodies, the prevalence and density of Plasmodium falciparum infection, and the prevalence of malarial disease in areas of Ouagadougou, Burkina-Faso. Thick blood smears, dried blood spots and clinical status have been collected from 3, 354 randomly chosen children aged 6 months to 12 years using two cross-sectional surveys (during the dry and rainy seasons) in eight areas from four ecological strata defined according to building density and land tenure (regular versus irregular). Demographic characteristics, socio-economic information, and sanitary and environmental data concerning the children or their households were simultaneously collected. Dependent variables were analysed using mixed multivariable models with random effects, taking into account the clustering of participants within compounds and areas. Results Overall prevalences of CSP-antibodies and P. falciparum infections were 7. 7 % and 16. 6 % during the dry season, and 12. 4 % and 26. 1 % during the rainy season, respectively, with significant differences according to ecological strata. Malaria risk was significantly higher among children who i) lived in households with lower economic or education levels, iii) near the hydrographic network, iv) in sparsely built-up areas, v) in irregularly built areas, vi) who did not use a bed net, vii) were sampled during the rainy season or ii) had traveled outside of Ouagadougou. Conclusion Malaria control should be focused in areas which are irregularly or sparsely built-up or near the hydrographic network. Furthermore, urban children would benefit from preventive interventions (e. g. anti-vectorial devices or chemoprophylaxis) aimed at reducing malaria risk during and after travel in rural areas. </p...|$|R

40|$|Most malarious {{countries}} {{outside of}} Africa are co-endemic for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. The comparative burden of anaemia {{in the community}} caused by these two species is incompletely characterized. A three-stage, cross-sectional, community survey {{was used to determine}} the proportion of moderate or severe anaemia (haemoglobin < 7  g/dL) attributable to patent P. vivax, P. falciparum and mixed parasitaemia in Papua, Indonesia. Adjusted population-attributable fractions were calculated from multivariable logistic regression models. Eight hundred and twenty-five households were surveyed with a total of 5255 occupants, 3890 (74  %) of whom were present and provided a blood sample. Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia was present in 8. 1  % (n =  315) of participants, P. vivax in 6. 4  % (n =  250) and mixed infections in 1. 9  % (n =  72). Overall, P. falciparum was associated with a mean reduction in haemoglobin of 1. 16  g/dL compared to those without patent parasitaemia [95  % confidence interval (95  % CI) 0. 91, 1. 41  g/dL]. The corresponding values for P. vivax and mixed infections were 0. 66  g/dL (95  % CI 0. 35, 0. 96) and 1. 25  g/dL (0. 71, 1. 80), respectively. Overall, 16. 7  % (95  % CI 8. 52, 24. 2  %) of haemoglobin concentrations < 7  g/dL in the community were estimated to be attributable to patent parasitaemia. The fractions for infants and 1 - 5  years old were 34. 4  % (95  % CI - 3. 30, 58. 3  %) and 23. 2  % (95  % CI 3. 34, 39. 0  %), respectively. Plasmodium vivax was associated with a greater than threefold higher attributable fraction of anaemia in infants compared with P. falciparum [27. 6  % (95  % CI - 3. 20, 49. 2  %) versus 7. 94  % (- 5. 87, 20. 0  %) ]. Despite comparatively low-level <b>endemicity,</b> <b>malaria</b> is associated with a significant proportion of all cases of community anaemia in southern Papua.
