Sekpona did not advance and was eliminated from Olympic competition after the first heat.|$|E
5|$|Ayouba Ali Sihame was the {{youngest}} competitor to be selected by Comoros at the London Games, aged 17. She qualified after receiving a universality place by FINA as her best time of one <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 21.54 seconds was not within the standard entry time. Sihame was drawn in the first heat of the women's 100 metre freestyle, which was held on 1 August, finishing third (and last) in her heat {{with a time of}} one <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 14.40 seconds. She finished behind the heat winner Mareme Faye from Senegal (one <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 6.42 seconds) and second-placed swimmer Shreya Dhital of Nepal (one <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 10.80 seconds).

5|$|Benjamin Enzema was {{the sole}} male athlete {{representing}} Equatorial Guinea at the Rio Games at age 27. He had previously competed at the 2012 Summer Games. Enzema qualified for the Games via a wildcard as his fastest time of one <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 53.35 seconds, set at the 2015 African Games, was 7.55 seconds slower than the qualifying standard for his event, the men's 800 metres. He was drawn in the third heat on 12 August, finishing eighth out of nine athletes, {{with a time of}} one <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 52.14 seconds. Enzema ranked ahead of final-placed finisher Alex Beddoes of the Cook Islands (one <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 52.76 seconds) but behind Brazil's Lutimar Paes (one <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 48.38 seconds) in a heat led by eventual gold medallist David Rudisha from Kenya (one <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 45.09 seconds). Overall, he finished 50th out of 54 runners, and was unable to advance to the later rounds because he finished 7.15 seconds slower than the slowest competitor in his heat who progressed to the second round.|$|E

5|$|Tazi also {{competed in}} the slalom on 21 February. After her first run of the day, in one <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 10.19 seconds, she was in 56th place. She {{recorded}} an improved time of one <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 6.96 seconds, placing her in 45th place for the second run.

5|$|Coquelin {{then was}} booked for his foul on Oscar, which earned Chelsea a free kick. Oscar's attempt was saved by Čech, who fisted the ball round the post. Chelsea {{continued}} to attack, though Arsenal withstood their pressure. John Terry rose highest from a {{corner in the}} 74th <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> headed the ball in Zouma's direction, which eventually was caught by Čech. Hazard's shot was blocked in the 79th <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> Oscar then spurned a chance, with Falcao unable to create something from it. In {{an effort to find}} an equaliser with ten minutes of normal time remaining, Mourinho brought on Moses in place of Terry and deployed a three-man defence. It nearly presented Arsenal the chance to score their second of the match, but for Cazorla to have his effort blocked and Aaron Ramsey on the rebound shooting wide.|$|E
5|$|Lamhamedi {{competed in}} the men's giant slalom on 19 February. In his first run, he {{finished}} in 51st position {{with a time of}} one <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 29.27 seconds. This second run was slightly slower, but his position increased to 48th in a time of one <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 29.96 seconds. This gave him an overall position of 47th (two minutes and 29.23 seconds), just ahead of Alexandru Barbu from Romania (two minutes and 29.24 seconds) but immediately behind Armenia's Arman-Ted Serebrakian. The event was won by Ted Ligety of the United States in a time of two minutes and 45.29 seconds.|$|E

Dixon was the second-fastest driver. Power's Team Penske teammates Castroneves and Briscoe rounded out the top four.|$|E
5|$|The stage 20 {{individual}} {{time trial}} {{was to be}} the Tour's final competitive stage, since its final stage is traditionally mostly ceremonial and only competitive at the sprint finish. Voeckler's position was likely secure, being a <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 13 seconds behind Evans and a <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 21 seconds ahead of Damiano Cunego, both time gaps unlikely to be recouped due to Voeckler's and Cunego's limited time trial skills. However, Rolland's position as best young rider remained in play due to his <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 33 seconds advantage over Taaramäe, and Taaramäe's time trial abilities well superior to Rolland's. Rolland rode one of the best time trials of his career to finish 21st. Taaramäe finished tenth, and took back 47 seconds, but it was insufficient to take back the white jersey. Eight of the nine Team Europcar riders completed the Tour, with the lone exception being Kern who had crashed out of stage 5. Voeckler finished fourth overall and Rolland tenth as the best young rider.|$|E

500|$|Early clock dials showed hours: {{the display}} of <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> seconds evolved later. A clock with a minutes dial is {{mentioned}} in a 1475 manuscript, <b>and</b> clocks indicating <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> seconds existed in Germany in the 15th century. [...] Timepieces which indicated <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> seconds were occasionally made from this time on, {{but this was not}} common until the increase in accuracy made possible by the pendulum clock and, in watches, by the spiral balance spring. The 16th-century astronomer Tycho Brahe used clocks with <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> seconds to observe stellar positions.|$|R
5|$|A more {{indirect}} consequence {{arose from}} the disagreements that occurred between Madero and his generals Villa and Orozco. The tensions began during the battle and continued afterward. In addition to the insubordination that the two leaders showed Madero while the fighting was still ongoing, they also clashed with him afterwards over payments to their soldiers and over the appointment of Venustiano Carranza as Madero's defence minister. Carranza was a civilian who had joined the revolution at the last <b>minute,</b> <b>and</b> for these reasons was despised by Orozco.|$|E

5|$|Bengaluru {{kicked off}} their season with an away game against Salgaocar on 9 January 2016. Bengaluru took an early lead when C.K. Vineeth put a pass from Kim Song-Yong in the net. However, {{just before the}} half time, Jackichand Singh was brought down by Eugeneson Lyngdoh in the penalty area and Salgaocar were awarded the penalty. Darryl Duffy {{converted}} the penalty and equalized for Salgaocar. In the second half, Sunil Chhetri converted the free-kick into the goal in 61st <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> Bengaluru FC won the game 2–1, registering their sixth consecutive win against Salgaocar in all competitions. Bengaluru played the next game against I-League debutant Aizawl F.C.. Curtis Osano's header from Keegan Pereira's free-kick in 27th minute was enough for Bengaluru to secure three points. In the first home game of the season, Bengaluru played Shillong Lajong. C.K. Vineeth registered the fastest goal of the season (38 seconds) for Bengaluru. Bengaluru doubled the lead when Kim Song-Yong scored his first goal for the team in 35th minute. Kim scored the brace in the 60th <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> Bengaluru {{reached the top of}} the table with the 3–0 and the third consecutive win. In the next away game against Mumbai F.C., Bengaluru quickly conceded the lead as Arata Izumi and Son Min-chol scored a goal each within 11 minutes. In spite of fair possession and counter-attack, Bengaluru couldn't convert their chances and faced the first loss of the season. The loss also ended Bengaluru FC's unbeaten streak of 16 games in the league dating back to previous season's game against Sporting Clube de Goa on 28 February 2015. In the month's last game, Bengaluru FC faced East Bengal and registered their first every away victory against the Kolkata side with a solitary goal by the captain Sunil Chhetri in the 60th <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> finished the month at the top of the table.|$|E

500|$|Claudette Mukasakindi was {{the oldest}} athlete to {{represent}} Rwanda at the London Games {{at the age of}} 29. She had not participated in any previous Olympic Games.

Mukasakindi participated in the marathon, held on 5 August, finishing 101st out of 107 competitors, with a time of two hours, 51 <b>minutes</b> <b>and</b> seven seconds.
