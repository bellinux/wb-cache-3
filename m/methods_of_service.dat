5000|$|While the Pennoyer {{and later}} Shoe doctrines limit the maximum {{power of a}} {{sovereign}} state, courts must also have authorization to exercise the state's power; an individual state may choose to not grant its courts the full power {{that the state is}} Constitutionally permitted to exercise. Similarly, the jurisdiction of Federal courts (other than the Supreme Court) are statutorily-defined. Thus, a particular exercise of personal jurisdiction must not only be permitted by Constitutional doctrine, but be statutorily authorized as well. Under Pennoyer, personal jurisdiction was authorized by statutes authorizing service of process, but these <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> often lacked because they required such service to be effected by officers of the state, such as sheriffs - an untenable method for defendants located outside of the state but still subject to jurisdiction due to their contacts with the state. Subsequent {{to the development of the}} Shoe Doctrine, states have enacted so-called long-arm statutes, by which courts in a state can serve process and thus exercise jurisdiction over a party located outside the state. The doctrine of International Shoe applies only in cases where there is no presence in the forum state. For example, if A committed a tort in State X. He is sued by B and B serves him with process just before he leaves State X before the flight was took off, the service would be valid and State X would have jurisdiction over A. If A did not comply with the final judgement passed by the courts of State X, B could enforce that judgement in the state where A resides under the full faith and credit clause of the US Constitution. There was one case where a defendant was served while the airplane was in the air over the forum State, and the federal district court held that this was valid service, since at law the territory of a state includes the airspace above the State.|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> {{provision}} in Slovak towns.   It addresses decision-making concerning selected services provision, based on a transaction cost economic model. The article looks at five types <b>of</b> <b>services</b> from that point of view. These are core services, i. e., services that are provided in most Slovak towns, thereby allowing outcomes of decision-making to be compared, and services which can be outsourced according to transaction cost theory. Findings partially confirm the hypothesis: Slovak towns do outsource, though “insourcing” moderately prevails. However, a comparison of several research studies in the area indicates a trend towards higher outsourcing <b>of</b> such local <b>services</b> provision.   The findings show that public bodies do not always select the most suitable <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> provision, {{as suggested by the}} transaction costs theory (the Brown-Potoski model). This indicates that it is not only economic models that influence decision-making concerning the organization <b>of</b> <b>services</b> provision in the Slovak towns. ...|$|R

The thesis is based on an analysis of current legislation, which is in the introductory chapter supplemented for completeness with historical excursus to the development of this area of law in past. The thesis is for clarity divided according to the individual manners of service.
