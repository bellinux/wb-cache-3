Following {{enactment}} of the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) in 1976, and later the Water Quality Act of 1987, states and cities have become more vigilant in controlling the containment and storage of toxic chemicals, thus preventing releases and leakage.

40|$|The role of {{material}} development and selection {{as well as}} product safety and liability is explored in this paper. The paper presents a conceptual framework which facilitates an interface between material selection and product safety/liability at the three planning-horizon levels of strategic, intermediate, and tactical. The five specific areas of interface include: (1) strategic <b>material</b> development and <b>usage,</b> (2) product safety, (3) product liability, (4) materials selection and testing and (5) <b>materials</b> <b>usage</b> and processing. Then, five propositions pertaining to each area of interface at each level of planning are proposed and evaluated for a company as an example. The {{results indicate that the}} company performed well for two propositions (2) and (3); and performed very poorly for three propositions (1), (4) and (5). The company had to comply with stringent safety and regulatory requirements but was under no internal or external pressure to improve its material development, selection, and processing practices. Finally, the conclusions, assessment, and future research directions are presented. Additional recommendations, prerequisites, or guidelines for effective incorporation of the propositions for the company or other companies that might embark on similar programs are proposed.

40|$|Abstract. Resources {{localization}} {{is one of}} {{the unique}} concerns of Appropriate Technology (AT) development. It has become a thought-provoking driver to related studies, meaning that there are wide-ranging opportunities to conduct researches, including ones on materials-related issues. Also, following the global concerns on environmental issues, assessment on environmental impacts imposed in AT life-cycle is interesting to be studied. Particularly, this study attempts to investigate potential impacts imposed by <b>materials</b> <b>usage</b> in AT. It is conducted by comparing and contrasting common approach in doing cleaner production to the implication of AT in providing cleaner application. This study aims to provide an integrated assessment framework for calculating environmental impacts from <b>materials</b> <b>usage</b> by incorporating the characteristics of AT life-cycle into account. The first finding points out the interdependency of cleaner production and cleaner application, meaning {{that there is a need}} of cleaner production in the manufacturing and construction process of any material/component/assembling in an AT; besides, the AT has to be designed to perform cleaner application, yet without reducing its performance and intention in localizing materials. Furthermore, the second finding pushes the first finding forward through an integrated environmental assessment diagram that covers materials production and application until the end of AT life-cycle, including disposal phase and predicted degradability of materials. By looking at common approaches that focused on the assessment of only cleaner production, this study is moving toward an integrated environmental assessment on an AT by covering both cleaner production and application to form a complete AT life-cycle assessment...|$|R
