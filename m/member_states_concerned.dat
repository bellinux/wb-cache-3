40|$|The European Commission {{has adopted}} a {{proposal}} to develop the trans-European network for freight and passenger transports (TEN-T). A multimodal core transport network for Europe has been proposed, {{as part of the}} TEN-T (including all modes of transport; roads, railways, airports and canals). As parts of the core network, ten core network corridors have been appointed. They will be used as instruments for implementing the entire core network. European Coordinators will facilitate the implementation of the core network corridors, in cooperation with corridor platforms to be established by <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>concerned.</b> There is no overall solution to how this core network with partly appointed network corridors would be managed, and how the corridor platforms will be synthesized and inter-organized to accomplish seamless transnational transport solutions. This literature review pinpoints three areas of specific importance for future work in creating transport corridor management structures. First, broad stakeholders inclusion, where formalized partnerships in agreements are suggested. Second, several ways of communication between stakeholders to ensure common progress, and third, to complement the dominant causation processes with effectuation processes to capture the stakeholders own driving forces towards common goals.

40|$|This {{paper has}} a rather explorative nature since it {{examines}} how a Social Europe could look like, politically and institutionally. Such a Social Europe is not thought {{out of the}} box (i. e. outside the Lisbon Treaty) but based on the current situation of op-outs, asymmetries and institutional novelties (particularly the Fiscal Compact) {{while at the same time}} adding a clear normative dimension: making the EU more democratic and accountable to its member states and its citizens. What will be developed is a EU that has freed itself from the one size fits all but instead leaves room for those member states that want to go further with European integration. This would allow some member states to build a genuine union (financial, economic as well as political and social) while other member states would have the choice not to do so. In other words, member states should be held accountable: either they support further integration or they stay outside of it. This decision should not be Brussels-made but offered to the public in the <b>member</b> <b>states</b> <b>concerned</b> (by elections or referenda). It is then legitimate for a country not to take part in some areas of integration like it is legitimate after public consultation to join at a later stage. In fact the EU is already experienced with such a system. This proposal would make these asymmetries (and the ways in which they are handled by the institutions) official and part of a new institutional and political architecture. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The European Commission {{has been}} pursuing, since 2001, {{the project to}} {{introduce}} a common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB) as a systematic solution to overcome the tax obstacles to cross-border business activity in the EC internal market, and, after some years of consultations and technical work on the shape of this new corporate tax regime, a Directive introducing the CCCTB seems finally bound {{to come out in}} the near future. This would be the most far-reaching piece of EC tax legislation ever introduced, and one of the key aspects of its working concerns the shaping of the tax audits regime for eligible businesses. Numerous and key questions are being raised by the shaping of this regime (e. g. : which tax authoriy can conduct the audit ? How can tax authorities of <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>concerned</b> collaborate with each others ? Should there be particular criteria for selecting the businesses to be subject to tax audits ?) : this paper (which was first submitted for an international conference on the CCCTB co-organised on 21 - 23 February 2008 by the Austrian and International Tax Law Institute of the Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration and by the European Commission, and subsequently approved for publication as a book chapter) aims at proposing responses to these questions and to further issues, and at identifying possible solutions which may reconcile the attractiveness of the new regime from the viewpoint of businesses with the need to prevent distortions in the functioning of the EC internal market.
