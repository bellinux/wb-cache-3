5000|$|The frescoes {{were found}} in the precinct of the Thutmosid palace at Tell el-Dab'a in {{thousands}} of fragments on lime plaster. The paintings have been partially reconstructed to reveal bull-leaping and bull-grappling scenes, some against a <b>maze</b> <b>pattern,</b> and felines chasing ungulates. There are also hunting scenes, life sized figures, men with staffs, and a white female wearing a skirt, as well as griffins. The paintings can date to the early phase of the palaces. One group of paintings was found fallen off the wall of a doorway, and the other group of fragments was found in dumps deposited by the north-east palace. [...] They seem to have been applied to the walls during the early part of Thutmose III's reign, and removed during the later Thutmosid period. There is a long frieze of bull-leaping and bull-grappling against a <b>maze</b> <b>pattern.</b> [...] Especially important are the emblems of the Minoan palace such as the half rosette frieze and the presence of big griffins which are {{the same size as the}} ones in the throne room at Knossos on Crete, and the technique of the paintings are typically Aegean.

When the angle formed by the surface and the c-axis is larger than 30 degrees, the observed domain configurations change to <b>maze</b> <b>patterns</b> because of an increase in the demagnetizing field at the surface.

Furthermore, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the energy in two regimes separated by a transition.

40|$|The {{surface of}} bogs {{commonly}} shows various spatial vegetation patterning. Typical are ¿string patterns¿ consisting of regular densely vegetated bands oriented {{perpendicular to the}} slope. Here, we report on regular ¿maze patterns¿ on flat ground, consisting of bands densely vegetated by vascular plants in a more sparsely vegetated matrix of nonvascular plant communities. We present a model reproducing these <b>maze</b> and string <b>patterns,</b> describing how nutrient-limited vascular plants are controlled by, and in turn control, both hydrology and solute transport. We propose that the patterns are self-organized and originate from a nutrient accumulation mechanism. In the model, this {{is caused by the}} convective transport of nutrients in the groundwater toward areas with higher vascular plant biomass, driven by differences in transpiration rate. In a numerical bifurcation analysis we show how the <b>maze</b> <b>patterns</b> originate from the spatially homogeneous equilibrium and how this is affected by changes in rainfall, nutrient input, and plant properties. Our results confirm earlier model results, showing that redistribution of a limiting resource may lead to fine-scale facilitative and coarse-scale competitive plant interactions in different ecosystems.

40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that the magnetic diffraction pattern of the isotropic disordered <b>maze</b> <b>pattern</b> is well described utilizing a gamma distribution of domain sizes in a one-dimensional model. From the analysis, the mean domain size and the shape parameter of the distribution are obtained.

As a proof of principle, a wedge-shaped (Co$_{tÅ}$/Pd$_{ 10 Å}$) 8 multilayer film, that covers the thickness range of the spin-reorientation transition, has been used. By means of soft x-ray resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS) and imaging techniques the thickness-driven evolution of the magnetic properties of the cobalt layers is explored. It is shown that minute changes of the domain pattern concerning domain size and geometry can be investigated and analyzed due to the high sensitivity and lateral resolution of the XRMS technique. The latter allows for the determination of the magnetic anisotropies of the cobalt layers within a thickness range of a few angstroms...|$|E
40|$|Episodic {{memories}} are a unique subtype of memory that encode the when, the where, and the what. The dentate gyrus within the hippocampus {{is vital for}} mediating pattern separation: the brain’s distinct ability to distinguish very similar memories from one another. Epilepsy, a disease characterized by hyper-excitation of neuronal circuits, is correlated with neuronal reorganization of the dentate gyrus. Previous studies from our lab have demonstrated that rats induced with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy through a low-dose kainate model have impaired behavioral performance on an 8 arm radial maze that tests for pattern separation. In this project, we asked whether these behavioral deficits were a precursor to, or a result of, chronic epileptogenesis. We introduced a 24 -hour video monitoring system, which allowed us to review recorded video of induced animals in a vivarium to observe and score seizures. This data was then compared to the data collected from behavioral trials {{and we found that}} in the adjacent condition of the 8 arm radial <b>maze</b> (<b>pattern</b> separation condition), those with confirmed epilepsy had a statistically significant increase in trials necessary to reach criterion when compared to the control group. Their performance was comparable to a dentate gyrus lesion group, which controlled for inhibited pattern separation function. In the non-adjacent 8 arm radial maze condition, {{there was no significant difference}} in performance between groups since this condition is not dentate gyrus-dependent. Holistically, we conclude that chronic epileptogenesis results in impaired pattern separation behavior. Histological analysis of Timm stained tissue further supports that mossy fiber sprouting is positively correlated with impaired pattern separation behavior...|$|E
40|$|A {{remarkable}} cervid bone accumulation {{occurs at}} a single passage (named Cervid Passage; CP) at Lapa Nova, a maze cave in eastern Brazil. CP lies away from cave entrances, is a typical pitfall passage and contains bone remains of at least 121 cervids, besides few bats, peccaries and rodents remains. There {{is no evidence of}} water (or sediment) flow at the site and in general bones lack post depositional alterations and display anatomical proximity, suggesting {{that the majority of the}} remains found inside CP (mainly cervids) are due to animals that after entering the cave got trapped in the site. Observations suggest that two entrances could have provided access to cervids (and the few other animals, besides bats), either by falling inside the cave or by entering by their own free will. Once inside the cave, the <b>maze</b> <b>pattern</b> would make route finding difficult, and of all passage intersections, only the one leading to CP would result in a non-return situation, starving the animal to death. Radiocarbon dates suggest that animal entrapment occurred during at least 5 thousand years, during the Holocene. The reasons why mainly cervids were found are unknown but they are probably related to the biology of this group coupled with the fact that caves provide several specific taphonomic processes that may account for a strong bias in bone accumulation. Indeed, the frequent occurrence of Cervidae in both the fossil and sub-fossil record in Brazilian caves may be related to an overall high faunal abundance or may suggest that these animals were especially prone to enter caves, perhaps in search of nutrients (as cave saltpetre) or water.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} mainly two topics {{in the field}} of {{coherent}} X-ray magnetic scattering are addressed. The first topic deals with the determination of spatial coherence properties of synchrotron radiation in the soft X-ray range by means of magnetic speckle patterns. For this purpose an X-ray resonant magnetic scattering experiment at the L 3 absorption edge of cobalt has been performed using Co/Pt multilayers and CoPd alloy films. The obtained magnetic speckle patterns arise from scattering at magnetic domain patterns due to the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism. A method is introduced that is based on the analysis of the Fourier transform of magnetic speckle patterns and gives access to the two-dimensional representation of the mutual coherence function. It exploits the fact that the autocorrelation function of a disordered magnetic <b>maze</b> domain <b>pattern</b> possesses perfectly flat side lobes. The method allows for the simultaneous determination of the transverse coherence length in all radial directions of the illuminating beam. The second topic deals with the investigation and characterization of magnetic <b>maze</b> domain <b>patterns</b> of a wedge-shaped Co/Pd multilayer film as a function of cobalt thickness close to and within the spin-reorientation transition. The thickness-driven evolution of the magnetic microstructure is studied by means of X-ray resonant magnetic scattering. Magnetic diffraction patterns of the magnetic domain structures as a function of cobalt thickness are extracted from the CCD images. The radial profiles of the scattering intensity reveal variations of the peak position, width and amplitude. For the interpretation of the changing intensity profiles a model has been developed to describe highly disordered <b>maze</b> domain <b>patterns.</b> The model is based on a synthetic one-dimensional domain pattern with gamma-distributed domain sizes to imply the significant domain size variations. It is described by the mean domain size, the domain-wall width, and the shape parameter of the gamma distribution that is found to be characteristic for a certain pattern geometry. As a proof of principle the obtained information from the scattering experiment is used to determine thickness-dependent anisotropies of the wedge-shaped Co/Pd multilayer...|$|R

Three scale models (1 / 150) of an identical <b>maze</b> <b>pattern</b> each with different visual information were used in the simulator which was designed to allow a subject to move through a model space and visually experience a travel sequence.   Three conditions of visual information were: 1)   no characteristics, with monotonous surfaces and uniform width of streets,  2)   variations in spatial arrangements, with changes of street width and corner shapes,  3)   symbolic information, provided by letters and photos of newspaper on the walls. Each of three male and three female subjects was first asked to memorize the route by viewing a predetermined continuous sequence of model street as shown on the screen, and were then asked to take the instructed route. This procedure was repeated until the subject could reach the end of the route. After the subjects reached the goal, they were asked to draw a cognitive map of the route. This series of experiment was conducted our times: 5, 12, 36 days after the first experiment. On and after the second experiment, the subjects were asked to explain the route verbally {{at the beginning of the}} experiment.   An analysis of the results shows that some people shift their wayfinding strategies reasonably according to visual information on the route, and other people tend to rely on mainly one type of information to memorize the route at any situation.

40|$|Tapagem Cave (or Devil’s Cave) is a river cave {{developed}} in the dolomite marble karst of the Serra do André Lopes (State of São Paulo, southeastern Brazil). Although this region is a plateau with significant variation in elevation and a humid subtropical climate, the cave is an anomalous feature in the André Lopes karst because there are few other caves. The marble, which is in a synclinal structure with subjacent phyllites, is a karst aquifer perched above the regional base level (Ribeira River) and has little allogenic recharge. The cave developed on a secondary anticline on the northwest flank of the marble synform forming a blind valley, the Tapagem River sink, that is an underground tributary of Ostras River. Development of the cave {{is due to the}} entrenchment of the Ostras through-valley and the large allogenic catchment area of the sink. In plan view, the morphology of the cave can be divided into three different sectors. The first sector, known as the Tourist Sector, has extensive collapse rooms, fossil passages and a variety of speleothems of notable dimensions. The second and most extensive sector is the river passage, which is a sinuous gallery controlled by marble banding with NE-SW cleavage and NW-SE fractures. In cross-section, the passages are vadose canyons up to 70 m in height, controlled by the marble banding. Four NW-SE diabase dykes in this passage do not affect its direction in plan view. The third sector is an extensive network of passages and collapse rooms, which are interlaced in plan view and on different levels, forming a <b>maze</b> <b>pattern.</b> Initially, the Tapagem and Ostras Rivers developed on a gentle surface and flowed into the Ribeira River. With the entrenchment of the Ostras through-valley, the Tapagem River partially infiltrated via a paleosink into the upper passage of the “Erectus Room, 2 ̆ 2 remaining a half-blind valley. Following a series of collapses and obstructions, the River next infiltrated via the current sink, creating a fully blind valley. Currently, the cave has a difference in elevation of 120 m between the sink and the resurgence, which corresponds to the difference in entrenchment between the two valleys...|$|E
40|$|The Castañar Cave (central western Spain) {{formed in}} mixed carbonate–siliciclastic rocks of Neoproterozoic age. The host rock is finely bedded and shows a complex network of folds and fractures, with a {{prevalent}} N 150 E strike. This structure controlled {{the development and}} the <b>maze</b> <b>pattern</b> of the cave, {{as well as its}} main water routes. The cave formed more than 350 ka ago as the result of both the dissolution of interbedded carbonates and weathering of siliciclastic beds, which also promoted collapse of the overlying host rock. At present it is a totally vadose hypergenic cave, but its initial development could have been phreatic. The cave's speleothems vary widely in their morphology and mineralogy. In general, massive speleothems (stalactites, stalagmites, flowstones, etc.) are associated with the main fractures of the cave and bedding planes. These discontinuities offer a fairly continuous water supply. Other branching, fibrous, mostly aragonite speleothems, commonly occur in the steeper cave walls and were produced by capillary seepage or drip water. Detailed petrographical and isotope analyses indicate that both aragonite and calcite precipitated as primary minerals in the cave waters. Primary calcite precipitated in waters of low magnesium content, whereas aragonite precipitated from magnesium-rich waters. Differences in isotope values for calcite (− 5. 2 ‰ for δ 18 O and − 9. 6 ‰ for δ 13 C) and aragonite (δ 18 O of − 4. 5 ‰ and δ 13 C of − 3. 5 ‰) {{can be explained by the}} fact that the more unstable mineral (aragonite) tends to incorporate the heavier C isotope to stabilize its structure or that aragonite precipitates in heavier waters. Changes in the water supply and the chemistry and instability of aragonite caused: (1) inversion of aragonite to calcite, which led to the transformation of aragonite needles into coarse calcite mosaics, (2) micritization, which appears as films or crusts of powdery, opaque calcite, and (3) dissolution. Dolomite, huntite, magnesite and sepiolite were identified within moonmilk deposits and crusts. Moonmilk occurs as a soft, white powder deposit on different types of speleothems, but mostly on aragonite formations. Huntite and magnesite formed as primary minerals, whereas dolomite arose via the replacement of both huntite and aragonite. Owing to its variety of speleothems and location in an area of scarce karstic features, the Castañar Cave was declared a Natural Monument in 1997 and is presently the target of a protection and research programme. Although the main products formed in the cave and their processes are relatively well known, further radiometric data are needed to better constrain the timing of these processes. For example, it is difficult to understand why some aragonite speleothems around 350 ka old have not yet given way to calcite, which indicates that the environmental setting of the cave is still not fully understood.

40|$|Paleoecological studies {{indicate}} that peatland ecosystems may exhibit bistability. This would mean that these systems are resilient to gradual changes in climate, until environmental thresholds are passed. Then, ecosystem stability is lost and rapid shifts in surface and vegetation structure at landscape scale occur. Another remarkable feature is the commonly observed self-organized spatial vegetation patterning, such as string-flark and <b>maze</b> <b>patterns.</b> Bistability and spatial selforganization may be mechanistically linked, the crucial mechanism being scale-dependent (locally positive and longer-range negative) feedback between vegetation and the peatland environment. Focusing on bogs, a previous model study shows that nutrient accumulation by vascular plants can induce such scale-dependent feedback driving pattern formation. However, stability of bog microforms such as hummocks and hollows {{has been attributed to}} different local interactions between Sphagnum, vascular plants, and the bog environment. Here we analyze both local and longer-range interactions in bogs to investigate the possible contribution of these different interactions to vegetation patterning and stability. This is done by a literature review, and subsequently these findings are incorporated in the original model. When Sphagnum and encompassing local interactions are included in this model, the boundaries between vegetation types become sharper and also the parameter region of bistability drastically increases. These results imply that vegetation patterning and stability of bogs could be synergistically governed by local and longerrange interactions. Studying the relative effect of these interactions is therefore suggested to be an important component of future predictions on the response of peatland ecosystems to climatic changes...|$|R
40|$|Because {{anthropogenic}} stressors {{have caused}} {{degradation of the}} Kushiro Mire, in subarctic northern Japan, seen as drying and invasion of alder-dominant shrub forest, the Japanese government recently started a project to restore a meandering former river channel and so diminish the shrub forest and recover the mire ecosystem. This paper describes the further development of the National Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology (NICE) model with surface-unsaturated–saturated water processes and land-surface processes assimilated with satellite data to include mutual interaction and feedback of hydrogeologic and vegetation dynamics in the mire. NICE iteratively simulated hydrologic cycle, elevation change, and vegetation succession, including the competition between two vegetation types (alder-dominant shrub forest and reed–sedge vegetation), to evaluate nonlinear relationship between drying and alder invasion in the mire and to examine a method for mire recovery. NICE reproduced well the heterogeneous alder invasion in the mire, implying that the study made some progress in explaining the positive feedback between geomorphology and eco-hydrology on irregular slopes and in heterogeneous vegetation, whereas most previous studies have considered regular slopes and their relation to string or <b>maze</b> <b>patterns.</b> Simulation results predicted that restoring meanders to the river channel would decrease the discharge and sediment loading of the river, increase the groundwater level downstream, and achieve a degree of mire recovery in the future. The heterogeneous vegetation succession is discussed in relation to regime shift in transient simulation. These results suggest the effectiveness of river restoration in conservation plans for mire recovery, {{and the importance of}} the process-based model in assessing the linkage of hydrological change and vegetation succession...|$|R
40|$|Conceptual and {{respective}} quantitative {{models of}} speleogenesis/karstifi cation developed for unconfi ned aquifers do not adequately representspeleogenesis in confi ned settings. A conceptual model for speleogenesis in confi ned settings is suggested, based on views about hydrauliccontinuity in artesian basins and close cross-formation communication between aquifers in multi-storey artesian systems. Soluble unitssandwiched between insoluble porous/fi ssured formations (common aquifers) initially serve as low permeability beds separating aquifersin a confi ned system. Conduits evolve as result of vertical hydraulic communication between aquifers across the soluble bed ("transversespeleogenesis"). Recharge from the adjacent aquifer is dispersed and uniform, and fl ow paths across the soluble bed are rather short. There {{is a specific}} hydrogeologic mechanism inherent in artesian transverse speleogenesis (restricted input/output) that suppresses the positive flow-dissolution feedback and hence speleogenetic competition in fissure networks, and accounts {{for the development of}} more pervasive channelling in confi ned settings, of <b>maze</b> <b>patterns</b> where appropriate structural prerequisites exist. This is the fundamental cause for the distinctions between cave morphologies evolving in unconfi ned and confi ned aquifers and for eventual distinctions of karstic permeability, storage characteristics and flow system behaviour between the two types of aquifers. Passage network density (the ratio of the cave length to the area of the cave fi eld, km/km 2) and cave porosity (a fraction of the volume of a cave block, occupied by mapped cavities) are roughly one order of magnitude greater in confi ned settings than in unconfined. Average areal coverage (a fraction of the area of the cave field occupied by passages in a plan view) is about 5 times greater in confi ned settings. Conduit permeability in unconfi ned settings tends to be highly heterogeneous, whereas it is more homogeneous in confi ned settings. The storage characteristics of confined karstifi ed aquifers are much greater. Recognition of the differences between origin, organisation and behaviour of karst systems evolved in unconfi ned and confined settings can improve efficiency of exploration and management of various resources in karst regions and adequacy of assessment of karst-related hazards...|$|R

Ts 65 Dn mice, the most extensively studied DS model, have three copies of ~ 50 % of the genes on Hsa 21 and display many phenotypes associated with DS, including cognitive deficits. DYRK 1 A is found in three copies in humans with Trisomy 21 and in Ts 65 Dn mice, and is involved in a number of critical pathways including CNS development and osteoclastogenesis. Epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG), the main polyphenol in green tea, inhibits Dyrk 1 a activity. We have shown that a three-week EGCG treatment (~ 10 mg/kg/day) during adolescence normalizes skeletal abnormalities in Ts 65 Dn mice, yet the same dose did not rescue deficits in the Morris water maze spatial learning task (MWM) or novel object recognition (NOR). Others have reported that An EGCG dose of 2 - 3 mg per day (90 mg/ml) improved hippocampal-dependent task deficits in Ts 65 Dn mice. The current study investigated deficits in a radial arm <b>maze</b> <b>pattern</b> separation task in Ts 65 Dn mice. Pattern separation requires differentiation between similar memories acquired during learning episodes; distinguishing between these similar memories is thought to depend on distinctive encoding in the hippocampus. Pattern separation has been linked to functional activity of newly generated granule cells in the dentate gyrus. Recent studies in Ts 65 Dn mice have reported significant reductions in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and after EGCG treatment, enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis. Thus, it was hypothesized that Ts 65 Dn mice would be impaired in the pattern separation task, and that EGCG would alleviate the pattern separation deficits seen in trisomic mice, in association with increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis. At weaning, Ts 65 Dn mice and euploid littermates were randomly assigned to the water control, or EGCG [0. 4 mg/mL], with both treatments yielding average daily intakes of ~ 50 mg/kg/day. Beginning on postnatal day 75, all mice were trained on a radial arm maze-delayed non-matching-to-place pattern separation task. Euploid mice performed significantly better over training than Ts 65 Dn mice, including better performance at each of the three separations. EGCG did not significantly alleviate the pattern separation deficits in Ts 65 Dn mice. After the behavioral testing commenced, animals were given ad libitum food access for five days, received a 100 mg/kg injection of BrdU, and were perfused two hours later. Coronal sections through the dorsal hippocampus were processed for BrdU labeling, and cells were manually counted throughout the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. The euploid controls had significantly more BrdU labeled cells than Ts 65 Dn mice, however, EGCG does not appear to increase proliferation of the hippocampal neuroprogenitor cells. This is the first report of deficits in Ts 65 Dn mice on a pattern separation task. To the extent that pattern separation depends on the functional involvement of newly generated neurons in an adult dentate gyrus, this approach in Ts 65 Dn mice may help identify more targeted pharmacotherapies for cognitive deficits in individuals with DS...|$|E

Thus, it was hypothesized that Ts 65 Dn mice would be impaired in the pattern separation task, and that EGCG would alleviate the pattern separation deficits seen in trisomic mice, in association with increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis. At weaning, Ts 65 Dn mice and euploid littermates were randomly assigned to the water control, or EGCG [0. 4 mg/mL], with both treatments yielding average daily intakes of ~ 50 mg/kg/day. Beginning on postnatal day 75, all mice were trained on a radial arm maze-delayed non-matching-to-place pattern separation task. Euploid mice performed significantly better over training than Ts 65 Dn mice, including better performance at each of the three separations. EGCG did not significantly alleviate the pattern separation deficits in Ts 65 Dn mice. After the behavioral testing commenced, animals were given ad libitum food access for five days, received a 100 mg/kg injection of BrdU, and were perfused two hours later. Coronal sections through the dorsal hippocampus were processed for BrdU labeling, and cells were manually counted throughout the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. The euploid controls had significantly more BrdU labeled cells than Ts 65 Dn mice, however, EGCG does not appear to increase proliferation of the hippocampal neuroprogenitor cells. This is the first report of deficits in Ts 65 Dn mice on a pattern separation task. To the extent that pattern separation depends on the functional involvement of newly generated neurons in an adult dentate gyrus, this approach in Ts 65 Dn mice may help identify more targeted pharmacotherapies for cognitive deficits in individuals with DS...|$|E
40|$|In this study, it was {{hypothesized}} that peopleis performance of way-finding depends on the characteristics of street-scapes, i. e., the more visual information exists the easier people find their own ways. This relationship was investigated by an experiment using an environmental simulator and analysis of the subjectis behavioural data recorded by the simulation system. Three scale models (1 / 150) of identical <b>maze</b> <b>patterns</b> (300 m x 300 m) which have different street-scapes were created and set in the simulator, in which an endoscope connected to CCD color TV camera controlled by a system operated by a personal computer. Three types of streets are: (1) having no characteristics with monotonous surface, (2) having characteristics on each corner with different buildings, (3) having characteristics along the streets with trees, columns or fences. The simulator allows a subject to move through the scale models and looking around, using a “joy-stick” for viewing the scene as projected on 100 -inch CCTV screen. The control system of the simulator records all signals generated by the “joy-stick” every 0. 01 second, and thus exact position within the model space and the viewing direction at given moment can be stored in the computer memory, which can be used to analyze the subjectis behaviour. The task of a subject was to find the way which was previously shown by the screen. Three male and three female subjects for each of three street types, for a total of eighteen subjects participated in the experiment. An analysis of the trace of movements and viewing directions generally supported the hypothesis that the street with visual characteristics were easier to memorize the route although there was a large difference in performance among subjects. It was also noted that there were three different strategies of way-finding according to the subject: one group of subjects seemed to rely on well structured knowledge of the route, i. e., the cognitive map, and the other group seemed to rely on incoming visual information of the changing scenes, and the last group seemed to find the way using both the cognitive map and visual information depending on the situations...|$|R

40|$|International audienceStatistical metrics {{can be used}} {{to analyse}} the {{morphology}} of natural or simulated karst systems; they allow describing, comparing, and quantifying their geometry and topology. In this paper, we present and discuss a set of such metrics. We study their properties and their usefulness based on a set of more than 30 karstic networks mapped by speleologists. The data set includes some of the largest explored cave systems in the world and represents a broad range of geological and speleogenetic conditions allowing us to test the proposed metrics, their variability, and their usefulness for the discrimination of different morphologies. All the proposed metrics require that the topographical survey of the caves are first converted to graphs consisting of vertices and edges. This data preprocessing includes several quality check operations and some corrections to ensure that the karst is represented as accurately as possible. The statistical parameters relating to the geometry of the system are then directly computed on the graphs, while the topological parameters are computed on a reduced version of the network focusing only on its structure. Among the tested metrics, we include some that were previously proposed such as tortuosity or the Howard's coefficients. We also investigate the possibility to use new metrics derived from graph theory. In total, 21 metrics are introduced, discussed in detail, and compared on the basis of our data set. This work shows that orientation analysis and, in particular, the entropy of the orientation data can help to detect the existence of inception features. The statistics on branch length are useful to describe the extension of the conduits within the network. Rather surprisingly, the tortuosity does not vary very significantly. It could be heavily influenced by the survey methodology. The degree of interconnectivity of the network, related to the presence of <b>maze</b> <b>patterns,</b> can be measured using different metrics such as the Howard's parameters, global cyclic coefficient, or the average vertex degree. The average vertex degree of the reduced graph proved to be the most useful as it is simple to compute, it discriminates properly the interconnected systems (mazes) from the acyclic ones (tree-like structures), and it permits us to classify the acyclic systems {{as a function of the}} total number of branches. This topological information is completed by three parameters, allowing us to refine the description. The correlation of vertex degree is rather simple to obtain. It is systematically positive on all studied data sets indicating a predominance of assortative networks among karst systems. The average shortest path length is related to the transport efficiency. It is shown to be mainly correlated to the size of the network. Finally, central point dominance allows us to identify the presence of a centralized organization...|$|R

To study if theta activity during risk-assessment was correlated with exploratory behavior in an approach/avoidance paradigm we recorded simultaneous local field potentials from this circuit in rats exploring the elevated-plus <b>maze</b> (EPM). Opposing <b>patterns</b> of power variations in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC), basolateral amygdala (BLA) and prelimbic (PrL) mPFC, {{but not in the}} dorsal hippocampus (dHPC), during exploratory risk-assessment of the open arms preceded further exploration of the open arms or retreat back to the safer closed arms. The same patterns of theta power variations in the HPC-BLA-mPFC(PrL) circuit were also displayed by animals submitted to chronic unpredictable stress protocol known to induce an anxious state. Diverging patterns of vHPC-mPFC(PrL) theta coherence were also significantly correlated with forthcoming approach or avoidance behavior in the conflict situation in both controls and stressed animals; interestingly, vHPC-BLA and BLA-mPFC(PrL) theta coherence correlated with future behavior only in stressed animals, underlying the pivotal role of the amygdala on the stress response...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe field {{generated}} by the electric organ of weakly electric fish varies with the electrical properties of nearby objects [1]. Correspondingly, current fluxes in this field differentially stimulate the electroreceptors in the fish's skin [2]. Thus, resistors are to conductors and insulators as gray is to black and white in optics. Additionally, the capacitances of plants and insect larvae contrast with those of water or stones, giving effects comparable to “coloration” [3]. Receptors [4] arrayed over a large area of the skin act like a retina upon which the discharge projects “electric images” [5]. By further central processing, the fish also discriminate between objects according to their composition [6], size, or distance [7], a procedure termed “electrolocation” [8], analogous to echolocation in bats [9]. Here we demonstrate that G. petersii and S. macrurus can also recognize 3 D orientations and configurations and extract and generalize spatial features solely with their electrical sense. We presented fish with virtual electrical “objects” formed from electrodes set flush in the inner surface of a Y <b>maze</b> with various <b>patterns</b> of external connectivity. With reward and aversion training, the fish could recognize similar electrode configurations and extract a feature, e. g., a vertical connectivity, present in various novel configurations. Previously, shape recognition has only been shown in electrolocating fish {{when they are in}} full mechanical contact with solid objects [10]...|$|R
