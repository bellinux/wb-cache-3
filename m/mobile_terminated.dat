5000|$|A Mobile Station Roaming Number (MSRN) is an E.164 defined {{telephone}} number used to route telephone {{calls in a}} mobile network from a GMSC (Gateway Mobile Switching Centre) to the target MSC (see Network Switching Subsystem).

A MSRN is assigned for every <b>mobile</b> <b>terminated</b> call, not only the calls where the terminating MS lives on a different MSC than the originating MS. Although this seems unnecessary since many vendors' VLR's are integrated with the MSC, the GSM specification indicates that the MSC and VLR (Visitor Location Register) do not need to reside on the same switch. They are considered two different nodes as they have their own routing addresses. The MSRN is one of the returned parameters into SRI_Response message. In particular the MSRN is used into an MNP scenario (in this case it can be modified as 'RgN + MSISDN' ...|$|E

50|$|In 1997 Christopher Kingdon, of Ericsson, handed in the Location Services (LCS) stage 1 {{description}} to {{the joint}} GSM group of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). As a result, the LCS sub-working group was created under ANSI T1P1.5. This group went on to select positioning methods and standardize Location Services (LCS), later known as Location Based Services (LBS). Nodes defined include the Gateway Mobile Location Centre (GMLC), the Serving Mobile Location Centre (SMLC) and concepts such as Mobile Originating Location Request (MO-LR), Network Induced Location Request (NI-LR) and <b>Mobile</b> <b>Terminating</b> Location Request (MT-LR). These use models were not really functional at the application context layer and needed more user-interface controls to make them ubiquitous. Those control came from Glassey's evolving models which expanded these and provided a secondary, more robust and very simple system for controlling digital objects and decision processes based on location and time.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — One of the {{challenges}} faced by telecom companies is to provide robust and powerful servers that are capable to handle the great increase {{of the number of}} subscribers and to accomplish the heavy Internet-based applications that generate a tremendous traffic load. Companies evaluate their products’ performance before releasing them to the market by applying a large amount of generated traffic to the telecom servers in order to measure their capability under traffic load; powerful solutions are hence needed for generating traffic and modeling various telecom protocols. In this paper, we propose a new traffic generator solution to load the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) for the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). This traffic generator loads the MSC through various mobile call scenarios such as location update, mobile call originating, <b>mobile</b> call <b>terminating,</b> and call clearing.

P-CSCF is responsible for routing incoming SIP messages to the IMS registrar server and for facilitating policy control. I-CSCF acts as an inbound SIP proxy server in the IMS. S-CSCF {{is the heart of the}} IMS core network. It facilitates the routing path for <b>mobile</b> originated or <b>terminated</b> session requests and is the most processing intensive node of the IMS core network. Finally, the Application Server (AS) is a standardized element in the IMS model, which hosts and executes services, and interfaces with S-CSCF using SIP.|$|R
40|$|Telecommunication {{applications}} {{have become}} {{some of the}} most important aspects of our daily life, especially with the Internet-based applications that are available even on cell phones. One of the challenges faced by telecom companies is to provide robust and powerful servers that are capable to handle the great increase of the number of subscribers and to accomplish the heavy Internet-based applications that generate a tremendous traffic load. Telecom companies evaluate their products' performance before releasing them to the market by applying a large amount of generated traffic to the telecom servers in order to measure their capability under traffic load. To do this, powerful solutions are needed, which generate traffic by modeling different telecom protocols. In this thesis, we propose a new technique of modeling a traffic generator solution to load the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) for the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). This traffic generator is modeled to load the MSC through various mobile call scenarios such as location update, mobile call originating, <b>mobile</b> call <b>terminating,</b> and call clearing. Based on that, we model the Radio Access Network Application Part protocol' procedures to generate the radio access messages that carry and handle the mobile messages. These mobile messages will be represented through the Mobility Management and the Call Control protocols' models. To achieve the above goals, we utilize the UML Use Case Model to describe the functional behaviors of the traffic generator, also we present the UML Analysis Model that provides the logical implementation of the functional behaviors of the proposed traffic generator...|$|R
50|$|Reverse SMS billing or premium SMS service {{means that}} the user of the {{recipient}} phone rather than the message sender is charged {{for the cost of}} the SMS message received. It is also called MT (<b>Mobile</b> <b>Terminated)</b> Billing. Reverse-billed SMS messages are only sent if specifically requested by the phone user; however, many unscrupulous operators will send reverse-charged messages without prior consent of the recipient, which often go un-noticed by users on Pay As You Go plans without itemised billing. The consent may also be hidden in the fine print of an advertisement. A daily weather alert {{is an example of a}} service where regular reverse-billed messages are received.|$|E

CAMEL allows the gsmSCP to block the submission (MO) or delivery (MT) of Short Messages, route messages to destinations other than that specified by the user, and perform real-time billing {{for the use of the}} service. Prior to standardized CAMEL control of the Short Message Service, IN control relied on switch vendor specific extensions to the Intelligent Network Application Part (INAP) of SS7.|$|E
5000|$|Messages {{are sent}} to a short message service center (SMSC), which {{provides}} a [...] "store and forward" [...] mechanism. It attempts to send messages to the SMSC's recipients. If a recipient is not reachable, the SMSC queues the message for later retry. Some SMSCs also provide a [...] "forward and forget" [...] option where transmission is tried only once. Both <b>mobile</b> <b>terminated</b> (MT, for messages sent to a mobile handset) and mobile originating (MO, for those sent from the mobile handset) operations are supported. Message delivery is [...] "best effort," [...] {{so there are no}} guarantees that a message will actually be delivered to its recipient, but delay or complete loss of a message is uncommon, typically affecting less than 5 percent of messages. Some providers allow users to request delivery reports, either via the SMS settings of most modern phones, or by prefixing each message with *0# or *N#. However, the exact meaning of confirmations varies from reaching the network, to being queued for sending, to being sent, to receiving a confirmation of receipt from the target device, and users are often not informed of the specific type of success being reported.|$|E

It {{is a collection}} of large number of mobile nodes that form temporary network. It completely different from other network. Due to the nature of MANETs, it more and more attacks from several sources. In this proposed work the SRCP (Secure Reliable Communication Protocol) for MANETs and a mobile agent system is a platform that can create, interpret, execute, transfer, and <b>terminate</b> <b>mobile</b> agents. A mobile agent system is regarded as an attractive technology when developing distributed applications. However, mobility makes it more difficult to trace agents. It is also more complex for agents {{to communicate with each other}} in a reliable manner. Therefore, a reliable communication protocol is necessary to control and monitor mobile agents and deliver messages between them. In this paper, a new Secure Reliable Communication Protocol (SRCP) is proposed for a multi region mobile agent computing environment. SRCP fulfills the following design goals: reliability, asynchrony, timeliness, location dependency, scalability, and communication cost...|$|R
40|$|Language {{run-time}} {{systems are}} increasingly being embedded in systems to support run-time extensibility via mobile code. Such systems raise a number of concerns when the code running in such systems is potentially buggy or untrusted. Although sophisticated access controls have been designed for mobile code and are shipping as part of commercial systems such as Java, there is no support for <b>terminating</b> <b>mobile</b> code short of terminating the entire language run-time. This article presents a concept called “soft termination ” {{that can be applied}} to virtually any mobile code system. Soft termination allows mobile code threads to be safely terminated while preserving the stability of the language run-time. In addition, function bodies can be permanently disabled, thwarting attacks predicated on system threads eventually calling untrusted functions. Soft termination guarantees termination by breaking any potential infinite loops in mobile code. We present a formal design for soft termination and an implementation of it for Java, built using Java bytecode rewriting, which demonstrates reasonable performance (3 to 25 % slowdowns on benchmarks) ...|$|R
40|$|The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) attempted, in late 1999, to {{introduce}} the calling party pays (CPP) regime for mobile cellular services, with a corresponding revenue-sharing arrangement between fixed and mobile operators. According to the revenue-sharing proposal, mobile operators in India were to be compensated for carrying traffic {{to and from the}} fixed networks. Under their original license conditions, fixed operators (usually one of the two state-owned incumbents) were not paying <b>mobile</b> operators for <b>terminating</b> calls on their networks. However, mobile operators had to compensate the state-owned incumbent for terminating traffic. This unfavourable environment for mobile operators has meant that mobile services {{have not been able to}} reach their full potential in India. There was great disappointment within the mobile industry when the TRAI's CPP order was overturned by the Supreme Court of India in early 2000, due to lack of jurisdiction. Since then, the enabling legislation has been amended. It is hoped that the new provisions of the TRAI Act will empower the regulator to establish a level playing field for mobile network operators. It is only through the creation of a suitable framework for interconnection that the TRAI will be able to ensure the success of telecommunications reform in India.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} <b>mobile</b> <b>terminated</b> (MT) SMS billing, an area {{of mobile}} commerce which has undergone massive growth with the maturation of mobile content delivery on 2. 5 G mobile networks. Although the short message service for GSM devices was never {{designed to be a}} facilitator for micropayments, premium SMS services have been embraced by many network operators worldwide. We investigate its inherent insecurity as a payment solution and show how existing systems can be used for fraud or to deceive users. From a UK perspective, we see how the standardisation of mobile platforms with J 2 ME combined with WAP delivery have enabled the rise of the mobile content industry, with premium SMS as the most method common of billing. Threats to the established business models are addressed, with particular attention paid to the potential for severe disruption from mobile (SMS) spam. Furthermore, we present attacks on MT SMS systems, showing how a malicious attacker could damage the mobile content industry by undermining consumer confidence in premium rate SMS payment solutions...|$|E
5000|$|Nearly {{all of what}} {{is known}} about the anatomy of plesiadapiforms comes from fragmentary jaws and teeth, so most {{definitions}} of plesiadapiform genera and species are based on dentition. Plesiadapis dentition shows a functional shift toward grinding and crushing in the cheek teeth as an adaptation towards increasing omnivority and herbivority. The dental formula for Plesiadapis is [...] The skull of Plesiadapis is relatively broad and flat, with a long snout with rodentlike jaws and teeth and long, gnawing incisors separated by a gap from its molars. Orbits are still directed to the side, unlike the forward-facing eyeballs of modern primates that enable three-dimensional vision. Although its braincase was small by todays standards, it was larger than in the contemporary hoofed mammals, for instance. Plesiadapis had <b>mobile</b> limbs that <b>terminated</b> in strongly curved claws, and it sported a long bushy tail which is beautifully preserved in the Menat skeletons. The way of life of Plesiadapis has been much debated in the past. Climbing habits could be expected in a relative of the primates, but tree-dwelling animals are rarely found in such high numbers. Based on this and other evidence, some paleontologists have concluded that these animals were mainly living on the ground, like todays marmots and ground squirrels. However, more recent investigations have confirmed that the skeleton of Plesiadapis is that of an adept climber, which can be best compared to tree squirrels or to tree-dwelling marsupials such as possums. The short, robust limbs, the long, laterally compressed claws, and the long, bushy tail indicate that it was an arboreal quadruped. Remains found showed that it had a body mass of around 2.1 kg.|$|R
40|$|When {{a person}} uses the {{traditional}} wireline telephone network to call another person {{on his cell}} phone, the fixed network must transfer the call to the mobile network to which the recipient subscribes. The fixed network provides originating access for the call, and the <b>mobile</b> network provides <b>terminating</b> access. This paper provides an economic analysis of the regulation of fixed-to-mobile termination rates. Mobile party pays (2 ̆ 2 MPP 2 ̆ 2) creates better incentives than calling party pays (2 ̆ 2 CPP 2 ̆ 2) for mobile network operators to place downward pressure on termination rates. Cellular telephone use in the United States and Canada has continued to increase at a significant pace despite the MPP regime and now far exceeds mobile telephone use in countries with CPP regimes. Multiple factors, including substitution possibilities for the callers of mobile subscribers, constrain the market power of mobile operators in setting mobile termination rates under CPP regimes. It is unrealistic for regulators to attempt to set mobile rates, including termination rates, at marginal cost. If large fixed network costs and customer acquisition costs must be recovered from variable charges, then marginal-cost-based pricing is not feasible. Also, the value to callers {{of being able to}} reach mobile subscribers justifies mobile termination charges that exceed marginal cost because of network externalities in mobile telecommunications. Finally, mobile termination rates that exceed marginal cost (or its proxy, long-run average incremental cost) are consistent with Ramsey (quasi-efficient) pricing. To the extent that high termination rates are a problem in countries that have embraced CPP, it is because customers are poorly informed of the charges they pay for their terminating calls. Consumer education would solve the potential market failure without the need to impose price regulation on otherwise competitive markets...|$|R
40|$|As the {{workforce}} goes mobile, {{there is an}} intensified need for a corporate to offer its employees a continuous access to the corporate intranet and colleagues regardless of actual location. IP-based Mobile VPNs {{is the name of}} the solutions created to solve the problem of always being reachable as well as to reach services. In a Mobile VPN, a mobile user is constantly and securely in touch with his/her corporate intranet. In addition, the mobile user is also reachable for his/her colleagues independent of actual location. The basic requirement for a Mobile VPN architecture is that there should not be any need for the <b>mobile</b> user to <b>terminate</b> application sessions when moving between subnets or access networks of different types. In addition the Mobile VPN should in as many respects as virtually possible reassemble the feeling of being connected to the office network. To achieve this, the following aspects from the end-user perspective are required from the mobile VPN architecture. • Mobility- Helps the user to locate and switch network • Connectivity- automates and controls connection set-up • Optimality- minimizes the cost of communication • Security- ensures failsafe security Essentially this means that the Mobile VPN solution should not limit the user while roaming. Instead the mobile client should act as an ordinary Internet computer in as many respects as possible. This paper compares two different ways of building a Mobile VPN. One alternative is to utilize session layer based mobility (a session proxy) and the other alternative is to deploy a network layer mobility concept. It is shown that a generally applicable future proof IP based Mobile VPN is based on network layer mobility, i. e. the IETF Mobile IP protocol...|$|R
