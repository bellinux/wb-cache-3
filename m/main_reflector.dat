In the Quadreflex (four reflection) configuration, each ray experiences four reflections, one {{at each of}} two subreflector surfaces and two at the <b>main</b> conical <b>reflector</b> surface.

Development of two basic antenna configurations conceived at JPL and utilizing conical <b>main</b> <b>reflectors</b> was pursued. A 4. 3 -m (14 -ft) -diameter model based on the two-reflection conical-Gregorian concept and a 1. 8 -m (6 -ft) -diameter model based on the four-reflection Quadreflex concept have been made and RF-tested.

50|$|To avoid {{spillover}} {{from the}} effects of over-illumination of the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> surface and diffraction, a microwave absorber is sometimes employed. This lossy material helps prevent excessive side-lobe levels radiating from edge effects and over-illumination. Note {{that in the case of}} a front-fed Cassegrain the feed horn and feeder (usually waveguide) need to be covered with an edge absorber in addition to the circumference of the main paraboloid.|$|E
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the Cassegrain {{is that the}} feed horn(s) must have a narrower beamwidth (higher gain) to focus its radiation on the smaller secondary reflector, instead of the wider primary reflector as in front-fed dishes. The angular width the secondary reflector subtends at the feed horn is typically 10° - 15°, as opposed to 120° - 180° the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> subtends in a front-fed dish. Therefore, the feed horn must be longer for a given wavelength.|$|E

5000|$|The {{physical}} <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> {{mirror is}} larger than 10 meters; it is actually about 11 m by 9.8 m. Upon first light, the usable optical aperture {{at any given time}} was 9.2 m. After a multi-year upgrade completed on July 29, 2015, the usable optical aperature was increased to 10m. [...] The mirror itself is composed of 91 hexagonal segments, a segmented mirror design like the Keck telescopes. Updates to the telescope have increased its field of view from 4 arcminutes to 22 arcminutes) (a full moon is 30 arcminutes for comparison). The telescope mirrors are aligned within a fraction of a wavelength of visible light by actuators under each segment. The tower next to the telescope, called the Center of Curvature Alignment Sensor Tower (CCAS), is used to calibrate the mirror segments. One of the advantages of this telescope design is that it was over 5 times more cost efficient for its aperture size than a more traditional design.|$|E

40|$|DSDP cores {{from areas}} of low (Site 505) and high heat flow (Site 504 B) near the Costa Rica Rift, {{together}} with seismic profiles from the Panama Basin, {{have been studied}} to determine the relationship between: (1) carbonate content and physical and acoustic properties; and (2) carbonate content, carbonate diagenesis and acoustic stratigraphy. Except for ash and chert layers, bulk density correlates strongly and linearly with carbonate content. Velocity is uniform downcore and only small variations at a small scale are measured. Thus an abrupt change in carbonate content will cause abrupt changes in acoustic impedance and should cause reflectors that can be detected acoustically. A comparison of seismic profiler reflection records with physical properties, carbonate content and reflection coefficients indicates that the <b>main</b> <b>reflectors</b> can be identified with ash layers, diagenetic boundaries, and carbonate content variations. Diagenesis of carbonate sediments is present at Site 504 B in a 260 m-thick ooze—chalk—limestone/chert sequence. These diagenetic sequences occur in areas of higher heat flow (200 mW m− 2).

40|$|The {{integration}} of seismic data with core data provides ground-truth toa structural interpretation of seismic data. The {{most important difficulty}} that arises in an integration effort isthe correct translation between the different scales of the core dataand the seismic data. In the absence of check-shots, detailed knowledge of the velocitystructure at the drilling locations is required, either from downholelogging measurements, velocity analysis of the seismic data, or directmeasurements on core samples. Three of the seven drill-sites during ODP (Ocean Drilling Program) Leg 177 in the south-eastern Atlantic were located on the Agulhas Ridge andconnected through eight seismic profiles. Synthetic seismograms created from velocity and density measurements onselected core samples generally show a good agreement with real seismicdata with respect to amplitude and waveform, whereas timing of theevents is troublesome. The use of velocity profiles with inaccurate sections along cores, afalse depth scale due to recovery problems, and inaccuracies in thepositioning during both seismic and coring operations are the mainshortcomings of this method.

40|$|Microearthquake {{signals from}} widely {{distributed}} geographical regions have been noticed repeatedly to be strongly affected by local site effects. The corre-sponding seismograms contain important {{information on the}} individual propaga-tion path. A single station inversion method is presented which allows the imaging of the subsurface impedance structure from locally recorded SH waves records. The technique {{is based on the}} Kunetz-Claerbout equation which in its original form states the relationship between the transmission response and the reflection response for P waves in a horizontally layered medium and vertical incidence (Claerbout 1968). By adapting Claerbout's formulation to the transmission prob-lem for SH waves under oblique incidence, microearthquake recordings can be used to calculate corresponding pseudo-reflection seismograms which in turn can be inverted for the impedance structure by exploiting Levinson recursion. Limitations in the high-frequency content of the signals due to the combined effects of absorption, recording system, and bandlimited source signals, as well as the influence of noise, drastically reduce the resolutional power of the inversion procedure. A number of different deconvolution techniques have been tested with synthetic seismograms for the applicability to reduce these effects. Good results have been obtained with the blind deconvolution technique of Scherbaum and Stoll (1985), utilizing the minimum phase property of the Green's function. From the analysis of synthetic data, it can be expected that for realistic source-receiver situations and short-period recording systems, the <b>main</b> <b>reflectors</b> down to a depth of several hundreds of meters could be resolved...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates a new {{approach}} {{for dealing with the}} adverse effects of large-scale deformations in the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> of large Cassegrain antennas. In this method, the incident aperture distribution is imaged onto a tertiary focal plane. This is accomplished by using an optical imaging system consisting of a lens mounted behind the Cassegrain focus of the antenna. The lens forms a real image of the product of the incident aperture distribution and the pupil function of the antenna. The pupil function describes the profile of the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> of the antenna. If the incident aperture distribution is a plane wave, a real image of the pupil function of the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> will be produced at the focal plane of the image lens. Any imperfections in the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> will be imaged onto the tertiary focal plane but over a smaller area as defined by the magnification of the system. In principle, an active correcting element placed into the tertiary focal plane could compensate for these errors, thus preserving the maximum efficiency of the antenna. Experimental verification of this principle was carried out in the lab using a dielectric lens 152. 4 mm in diameter. Phase perturbations were simulated by placing dielectric shims in the incident aperture plane. The phase of these shims in most cases was measured to within 10 degrees in the image plane. This degree of accuracy is found to be quite adequate for correcting large-scale errors in the <b>main</b> <b>reflector</b> of the antenna...|$|E

40|$|Modern {{radar and}} sonar systems rely on active sensing to {{accomplish}} a variety of tasks, including detection and classification of targets, accurate localization and tracking, autonomous navigation and collision avoidance. Bats have relied on active sensing for over 50 million years and their echolocation system provides remarkable perceptual and navigational performance that are of envy to synthetic systems. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the mechanisms bats use to process echo acoustic signals and investigate if there are lessons that can be learned and ultimately applied to radar systems. The basic principles of the bat auditory system processing are studied and applied to radio frequencies. A baseband derivative of the Spectrogram Correlation and Transformation (SCAT) model of the bat auditory system, called Baseband SCAT (BSCT), has been developed. The BSCT receiver is designed for processing radio-frequency signals and to allow an analytical treatment of the expected performance. Simulations and experiments have been carried out to confirm that the outputs of interest of both models are “equivalent”. The response of the BSCT to two closely spaced targets is studied and it is shown that the problem of measuring the relative distance between two targets is converted to a problem of measuring the range to a single target. Nearly double improvement in the resolution between two close scatterers is achieved with respect to the matched filter. The robustness of the algorithm has been demonstrated through laboratory measurements using ultrasound and radio frequencies (RF). Pairs of spheres, flat plates and vertical rods were used as targets to represent two <b>main</b> <b>reflectors...</b>|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{basement}} lies at {{an average}} of between 6. 0 and 6. 5 sec two-way time below sea level in the southern Rockall Trough and northern Porcupine Abyssal Plain. The overlying sedimentary succession reaches maximum thicknesses of at least 4. 0 sec, and can be divided by 3 regionally-developed seismic reflecting horizons, which are used as a framework to establish an acoustic stratigraphy for the area by selecting three “type” seismic sections. These reflectors are named, in ascending order, Shackleton, Charcot and Challenger. The area is crossed by E—W basement high structures, the Clare Lineament (which may be an easterly extension of the Charlie Gibbs Fracture Zone), that separates the Porcupine Abyssal Plain from the eastern part of southern Rockall Trough. Under the latter, the post-Shackleton acoustic sequence is thickened, as if dammed {{to the north of the}} Clare Lineament, whilst a further thickening, above reflector Charcot, occurs along a NE—SW line somewhat farther north into the southern Rockall Trough. This can also be related to shallow-lying acoustic basement features. Pre-Shackleton sediments overlie a very irregular basement topography. The acoustic characters of the various sediment packages are described and it is speculated that major changes in the sedimentary environments took place across reflectors Shackleton and Challenger, the latter probably establishing the modern bottom current circulation patterns. No ages can be unequivocally assigned to the <b>main</b> <b>reflectors,</b> but previously published data suggest a late Eocene—Oligocene age for Challenger.

Airborne electromagnetics (AEM) is a very valuable methodology that can provide high density, high quality data to produce 3 D hydrogeological models to depths in excess of hundred meters below surface water column. We present {{the results from the}} SkyTEM Venice lagoon survey of 2009, integrated with data from very high resolution seismic survey. The AEM data results enhance greatly the understanding of the hydrogeology and surface-groundwater interactions in the lagoon area, where indirect measurements abound but wells are missing. For example, there is clear evidence of fresh water aquifers underneath {{the central part of the}} lagoon, at depth of about 40 m. The near surface part of the AEM data compare well with seismic data, showing that <b>main</b> <b>reflectors</b> come from the interface between the superficial Late Pleistocene looser, saline water saturated sediments and the deeper, more compact and fresher Holocene sediments. There is also clear evidence of submarine groundwater discharge in the lagoon, of paleorivers, and a possible indication of gas seepage trough shallow sediments. Seismic and AEM provide complimentary datasets to discriminate between pore water salinity, lithology and gas. Seismic horizons can actually be included during inversion of AEM data, producing more robust output. AEM data from the southern part of the survey that crosses the shore line and continued also onshore allow a clear mapping of the saline water intrusion inland, and highlight the relationship between pore water salinity of the lagoon sediments and spatial distribution of salt marshes.
