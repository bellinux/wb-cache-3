A distributed lag model is developed to deal with these two characteristics of aggregate <b>monthly</b> <b>data.</b> The model is generalized to permit production rate to influence labor productivity. This generalized model is then estimated and compared to a cumulative average learning curve in analyzing the impact of a production break.

40|$|Many {{macroeconomic}} series such as US {{real output}} growth are sampled quarterly, although potentially useful predictors are often observed {{at a higher}} frequency. We look at whether a mixed data-frequency sampling (MIDAS) approach can improve forecasts of output growth. The MIDAS approach is compared to other ways of making use of <b>monthly</b> <b>data</b> to predict quarterly output growth. The MIDAS specification used in the comparison employs a novel way of including an autoregressive term. We find {{that the use of}} <b>monthly</b> <b>data</b> on the current quarter leads to significant improvement in forecasting current and next quarter output growth, and that MIDAS is an effective way of exploiting <b>monthly</b> <b>data</b> compared to alternative methods.
