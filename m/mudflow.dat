5|$|On {{the morning}} of February 19, 1845, a large {{earthquake}} resulted in a substantial <b>mudflow.</b> This <b>mudflow</b> flowed down {{the valley of the}} Lagunillas River for approximately , spilling out of the river channel and killing much of the local population. After reaching an alluvial fan, the <b>mudflow</b> split into two branches. The larger portion of it joined the Lagunillas River and flowed into the nearby Magdalena River, while the smaller portion was diverted by hills in front of Lagunillas Canyon, turned 90degrees to the north until it reached the Sabandija River, and then flowed east with the Sabandija River, until it rejoined the other branch of the <b>mudflow</b> at the junction of the Sabandija and the Magdalena. It is estimated that 1000people were killed in the mudflows.|$|E
5|$|Mount Rainier is {{currently}} {{listed as a}} Decade Volcano, {{or one of the}} 16 volcanoes with the greatest likelihood of causing great loss of life and property if eruptive activity resumes. If Mt. Rainier were to erupt as powerfully as Mount St. Helens did in its May18, 1980 eruption, the effect would be cumulatively greater, because of the far more massive amounts of glacial ice locked on the volcano compared to Mount St. Helens, the vastly more heavily populated areas surrounding Rainier, and the simple fact that Mt Rainier is a much bigger volcano, almost twice the size of St. Helens. Lahars from Rainier pose the most risk to life and property, as many communities lie atop older lahar deposits. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), about 150,000 people live on top of old lahar deposits of Rainier. Not only is there much ice atop the volcano, the volcano is also slowly being weakened by hydrothermal activity. According to Geoff Clayton, a geologist with a Washington State Geology firm, RH2 Engineering, a repeat of the Osceola <b>mudflow</b> would destroy Enumclaw, Orting, Kent, Auburn, Puyallup, Sumner and all of Renton. Such a <b>mudflow</b> might also reach down the Duwamish estuary and destroy parts of downtown Seattle, and cause tsunamis in Puget Sound and Lake Washington. Rainier is also capable of producing pyroclastic flows and expelling lava.|$|E
5|$|St. Helens {{started its}} {{growth in the}} Pleistocene 37,600 years ago, during the Ape Canyon stage, with dacite and {{andesite}} eruptions of hot pumice and ash. 36,000 years ago a large <b>mudflow</b> cascaded down the volcano; mudflows were significant forces in all of St. Helens' eruptive cycles. The Ape Canyon eruptive period ended around 35,000 years ago and was followed by 17,000 years of relative quiet. Parts of this ancestral cone were fragmented and transported by glaciers 14,000 to 18,000 years ago during the last glacial period of the current ice age.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mudflows</b> (also called debris flows or lahars, a Javanese {{term for}} {{volcanic}} <b>mudflows)</b> are mixtures of volcanic debris and water. The water usually comes from two sources: rainfall or the melting {{of snow and}} ice by hot volcanic debris, such as lava. Depending on the proportion and temperature of water to volcanic material, <b>mudflows</b> can range from fast-flowing, soupy floods to thick, gooey flows that have the consistency of wet concrete. As <b>mudflows</b> sweep down the steep sides of stratovolcanoes, they have the strength and speed to flatten or bury everything in their paths. Hot ash, lava flows and pyroclastic surges from the 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia melted snow and ice atop the 5,321 meter-high Andean volcano. The ensuing <b>mudflows</b> buried the nearby city of Armero, killing 25,000 people.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mudflows</b> {{are often}} called mudslides, a term applied indiscriminately by {{the mass media}} {{to a variety of}} mass wasting events. <b>Mudflows</b> often start as slides, {{becoming}} flows as water is entrained along the flow path; such events are often called flow slides.|$|R
40|$|Mechanism of {{formation}} of the catastrophic <b>mudflows</b> in different glacial valleys of Elbrus region at the present stage of glacial degradation is described. The important role of the buried ice in the {{formation of}} catastrophic <b>mudflows</b> that affected Tyrnyauz in the XX century was revealed as a result of remote monitoring of changes in glacial-moraine complex of Kayarta river. The dynamics of glacial lakes in the Adyl-Su valley in the Bashkara Glacier region was described and probability of their breakthrough was estimated. The quantitative indicators of the dynamics of the landslide in the Kubasanty valley were obtained as a result of remote monitoring, and its influence on the formation of catastrophic <b>mudflows</b> is discovered. Various possible methods of catastrophic <b>mudflows</b> prevention not requiring expensive protective constructions are discussed. </p...|$|R
5|$|A {{different}} {{school of}} thought developed {{almost half a century}} later, with palaeontologist David Weishampel suggesting that the skeletons from the lower layers stemmed from a herd that died catastrophically in a <b>mudflow,</b> while those in the upper layers accumulated over time. Weishampel explained the curious monospecific assemblage by theorizing that Plateosaurus were common during this period. This theory was erroneously attributed to Seemann in a popular account of the plateosaurs {{in the collection of the}} Institute and Museum for Geology and Palaeontology, University of Tübingen, and has since become the standard explanation on most internet sites and in popular books on dinosaurs. Rieber proposed a more elaborate scenario, which included the animals dying of thirst or starvation, and being concentrated by mudflows.|$|E
5|$|The find of {{a herd of}} six Psittacosaurus {{individuals}} {{killed and}} buried by a volcanic <b>mudflow</b> indicates the presence {{of at least two}} age groups from two distinct clutches gathered together. This find has been taken as evidence for group fidelity and gregariousness extending beyond the nest; the earliest such evidence for any ceratopsian. Even very young psittacosaur teeth appear worn, indicating they chewed their own food and may have been precocial. Another juvenile-only cluster shows that specimens of different ages grouped together. These juveniles may have associated together as a close knit, mixed-age herd either for protection, to enhance their foraging, or as putative helpers at the parental nest. There is no evidence for parental care.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few hours after the <b>mudflow</b> hit, she was covered by {{concrete}} but got her hand {{through a crack in}} the debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood {{over the course of a}} day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet.|$|E

25|$|Lahars (a type of <b>mudflow</b> of {{pyroclastic}} material and water) {{are an important}} hazard on the mountain, and are caused by rain remobilizing pyroclastic flow deposits. Lahars can be detected seismically, as they cause a high-frequency seismic signal. Observations have found that about 50mm of rain per hour is the threshold above which lahars are often generated.|$|E
25|$|The Carrow {{formation}} is a predominantly fine-grained redbed (consisting of typically red sedimentary rocks) unit {{that has a}} grade ranging from pebbles and cobble in conglomerate at the base to mudstone laced with calcrete at the top. The flow is littered with abundant flows from the Seelys (in the intercaldera sequence) and Rothea (earlier) formation towards the southeast, but in the north metasedimentary rocks, which are sedimentary rocks exhibiting metamorphosis, predominate. The {{lower part of the}} formation consists of unwelded and highly compacted lapilli tuff with abundant amounts of pumice fragments. A basalt and basalt-clad <b>mudflow</b> occurs near the top if the formation in some places. A dated locality {{from the top of the}} formation has been dated to the Late Devonian, around 350 million years ago. The exposed part of the formation forms a long band around the South Oromocto Andesite formation, and is colored brown on the map.|$|E
25|$|Volcanoes {{can cause}} {{widespread}} destruction and consequent disaster in several ways. The effects include the volcanic eruption itself that may cause harm following {{the explosion of}} the volcano or falling rocks. Secondly, lava may be produced during the eruption of a volcano, and so as it leaves the volcano the lava destroys many buildings, plants and animals due to its extreme heat. Thirdly, volcanic ash, generally meaning the cooled ash, may form a cloud, and settle thickly in nearby locations. When mixed with water this forms a concrete-like material. In sufficient quantities, ash may cause roofs to collapse under its weight but even small quantities will harm humans if inhaled. Since the ash has the consistency of ground glass it causes abrasion damage to moving parts such as engines. The main killer of humans in the immediate surroundings of a volcanic eruption is the pyroclastic flows, which consist of a cloud of hot volcanic ash which builds up in the air above the volcano and rushes down the slopes when the eruption no longer supports the lifting of the gases. It is believed that Pompeii was destroyed by a pyroclastic flow. A lahar is a volcanic <b>mudflow</b> or landslide. The 1953 Tangiwai disaster was caused by a lahar, as was the 1985 Armero tragedy in which the town of Armero was buried and an estimated 23,000 people were killed.|$|E
500|$|The {{collapse}} of the northern flank of St. Helens mixed with ice, snow, and water to create lahars (volcanic <b>mudflows).</b> The lahars flowed many miles down the Toutle and Cowlitz Rivers, destroying bridges and lumber camps.

In the 1595 eruption, three distinct Plinian eruptions produced lahars that claimed the lives of 636people. During the 1845 event, 1,000people were killed by earthquake-generated <b>mudflows</b> near the Magdalena River.|$|R
25|$|The JakartaGlobe {{reported}} on 8 November {{that at least}} 135 people had died on Merapi's slopes over the previous two weeks, and that authorities were still struggling on Sunday to help those injured from Friday's massive eruption. The bodies of {{four members of the}} Indonesian Disaster Response Team were found on the slopes of Mount Merapi on Monday, 8 November. A Search and Rescue (SAR) team discovered the bodies at 06:00 at the Glagaharjo barracks. The building itself had been destroyed by a volcanic <b>mudflow</b> according to the returning retrieval party. The team reported recovering four bodies and seeing one further. Another body in Banjarsari hamlet was found by an Army Special Forces (Kopassus) team. However rescue officials had to retreat as eruptive activity made their further presence on the slopes too dangerous. A hot ash cloud from an eruption forced the SAR group to leave the area carrying only one corpse while the three other bodies were left behind. The Jakarta Globe, quoting the Antara news agency, reported the same day that a total of six bodies of the missing Disaster Response Team members were recovered from the village of Glagaharjo in Sleman, Yogyakarta. The bodies of another two members of the response team, known as Tagana, were yet to be found or recovered. The victims had been missing since Thursday and were presumed dead.|$|E

500|$|Remnants of past, prehistoric lava domes are main {{components}} of {{the summit of the}} volcano, in addition to its false summit, Disappointment Peak. Past pyroclastic flow deposits are easily visible in river valleys near the volcano, likely caused by lava dome collapse, along with ridges found east of the summit consisting of ash cloud remains. On its western flank, the volcano also has a lahar, or <b>mudflow</b> deposit, which runs for about [...] into the White Chuck River Valley around 14,000 years ago.
