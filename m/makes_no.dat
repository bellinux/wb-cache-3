5|$|In Longstreet's final report, he <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> {{mention of}} any other officer being {{in charge of the}} unit. In point of fact his final report <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> mention of Pickett or his division. Pickett {{commanded}} the men remaining in his division and reported to Longstreet. These men surrendered with Pickett at Appomattox. Regarding Pickett and his division, no source can be produced which asserts anything otherwise.|$|E
5|$|But beyond that, it <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> {{effort to}} address the {{subjective}} vs. objective question, nor does its discussion of intent delve into the matter of specific vs. general intent. Some appeals courts, however, have developed more specific entrapment tests on their own.|$|E

5|$|The treaty as {{set down}} by Polybius <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> mention of an {{invasion}} of Italy by Philip, the débâcle at Sazan perhaps having soured Philip on such a venture — something which in any case Hannibal may not have desired.|$|E
5|$|Butlin {{remained}} {{close to}} his mother, both in following her to Canada and in arranging {{for her to come}} home {{after the death of his}} stepfather. She died in 1934 and never saw his first holiday camp. By contrast, Butlin <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> mention in his biography of his father after returning from Canada. Public records from South Africa show that his father remained in Cape Town for the rest of his life, dying in 1954.|$|E
5|$|Designed in {{accordance}} with the standards of Maharishi Vastu Architecture, it features a blend of architectural styles across India. It is entirely constructed from Rajasthani pink sandstone and Italian Carrara marble. Based on traditional Hindu architectural guidelines (Shilpa shastras) on maximum temple life span, it <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> use of ferrous metal. Thus, it has no support from steel or concrete.|$|E

5|$|During the Battle of the Alps, 154 French {{soldiers}} were {{captured by the}} Italians. These prisoners were forgotten during the armistice negotiations, and the final agreement <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> mention of them. They were held at the POW camp in Fonte d'Amore in Sulmona, along with 600 Greeks and 200 Britons, treated, by all accounts, {{in accordance with the}} laws of war. Their fate is unknown after Italy's armistice with the Allies, when they presumably came under German control.|$|E
5|$|If {{my letter}} <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> appeal to your heart, on the {{eleventh}} day {{of this month}} I shall proceed with such co-workers of the Ashram as I can take, to disregard {{the provisions of the}} Salt Laws. I regard this tax to be the most iniquitous of all from the poor man's standpoint. As the sovereignty and self-rule movement is essentially for the poorest in the land, the beginning will be made with this evil.|$|E

5|$|Monteverdi {{recorded}} {{no apparent}} {{interest in the}} performance of Andromeda after the 1620 Carnival; the long letter that he wrote to Striggio on 13 March 1620 <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> reference to the event and is chiefly concerned with financial matters. The letter implies that the Gonzaga court was trying to persuade Monteverdi to return to Mantua; in courtly language Monteverdi evades the issue, while comparing the relative generosity of his Venetian employers with the parsimony of the Gonzaga court.|$|E
5|$|Plutarch <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> further {{mention of}} events until the initial {{confrontation}} between Marcus Licinius Crassus and Spartacus {{in the spring}} of 71 BC, omitting the march on Rome and the retreat to Thurii described by Appian. However, as Plutarch describes Crassus forcing Spartacus' followers to retreat southwards from Picenum, it could be inferred that the rebel slaves approached Picenum from the south in early 71 BC, implying that they withdrew from Mutina into southern or central Italy for the winter of 72–71 BC.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{conflict}} on Daley's military record. The only book-length {{biography of}} Daley <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> mention of military service. A 1995 {{profile in the}} Chicago Sun-Times stated that Daley served in the United States Marine Corps Reserve from 1961 to 1967, while a 1996 profile in People Magazine cited 1960 to 1964. A civilian website for Marines and their families found no military record for Daley.|$|E

5|$|The early {{astronomy}} {{of ancient}} Greece {{was influenced by}} knowledge transmitted from the Mesopotamian culture. Thus the Babylonians associated Mars with Nergal, their god of war and pestilence, and the Greeks connected the planet with their god of war, Ares. During this period, the motions of the planets were of little interest to the Greeks; Hesiod's Works and Days (c. 650 BCE) <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> mention of the planets.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} the funeral of Angela, who {{departed}} the show during the second series, after being killed by a moose, {{at least according to}} Guy.

Quatermass interviews local residents and discovers ghosts and poltergeists have been common {{in the area for}} decades. A hysterical soldier is carried out of the object, claiming to have seen a dwarf-like apparition walk through the wall of the artefact, a description that matches a 1927 newspaper account of a ghost.|$|E

5|$|This working {{definition}} {{has since}} been widely used by astronomers when publishing discoveries of exoplanets in academic journals. Although temporary, it remains an effective working definition until a more permanent one is formally adopted. It {{does not address the}} dispute over the lower mass limit, and so it steered clear of the controversy regarding objects within the Solar System. This definition also <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> comment on the planetary status of objects orbiting brown dwarfs, such as 2M1207b.|$|E
