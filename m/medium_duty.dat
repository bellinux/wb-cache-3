25|$|Ford {{continues}} to manufacture <b>medium</b> <b>duty</b> trucks under the F-650 and F-750 badges. In 2001, the company {{entered into a}} joint venture with Navistar International to produce medium and heavy duty commercial trucks. The first new model from the new corporation, known as Blue Diamond Truck Company LLC, was the 2006 model year LCF. The LCF was discontinued in 2009 and Ford's 2011 medium and heavy-duty commercial offerings are limited to the two F-Series.|$|E

All light duty vehicles (i.e. less than 8,500 pounds) sold in North America since 1996, {{as well as}} <b>medium</b> <b>duty</b> vehicles (i.e. 8,500-14,000 pounds) beginning in 2005, and heavy duty vehicles (i.e. greater than 14,000 pounds) beginning in 2010, are required to support OBD-II diagnostics, using a standardized data link connector, and {{a subset of the}} SAE J/1979 defined PIDs (or SAE J/1939 as applicable for medium/heavy duty vehicles), primarily for state mandated emissions inspections.|$|E
25|$|The {{excess power}} {{generation}} capacity available in India is nearly 500 billion units/year presently and another 75,000 MW conventional power generating capacity is in pipeline excluding the targeted 175,000 MW renewable power by 2022. The hydrogen fuel generated by 500 billion units of electricity can replace all diesel and petrol consumed by heavy and <b>medium</b> <b>duty</b> vehicles in India completely obviating {{the need of}} crude oil imports for internal consumption. Converting petrol/diesel driven road vehicles in to fuel cell electric vehicles on priority would save the huge import cost of crude oil and transform the stranded electricity infrastructure in to productive assets with major boost to the overall economic growth.|$|E

25|$|Medium-duty {{trucks and}} Heavy-duty trucks have {{recently}} adopted 4×4 drive-trains. 4×4 medium-duty trucks became common after Ford Motor Company began selling Ford Super Duty trucks. The Super Duty trucks shared many parts between the light duty and <b>medium</b> <b>duty,</b> reducing production costs. The Dana 60 front axle {{is used on}} both medium- and light-duty Super Duty trucks. Furthermore, the Big Three share/shared parts between the companies reducing costs. The Dana S 110 is currently being used for the rear drive, under Ford and Ram's medium-duty trucks. The Dana 110 was also used on the General Motors 4×4s as well. Ram Trucks began selling medium-duty trucks, 4×4 and 4×2, in 2008. General Motors sold a 4×4 for model years 2005-2009.|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} 1960s the company {{introduced}} a renovated JL heavy and <b>medium</b> <b>duty</b> trucks range with a revised design, new {{buses and coaches}} and, in 1964, a S range of <b>medium</b> <b>duty</b> trucks (with Renault and Perkins engines), unveiled at the Paris Motor Show. [...] In January 1961, Saviem {{took control of the}} bus manufacturer Floirat, based at Annonay. That year, Saviem signed a cooperation agreement with Henschel-Werke. In 1962, Pierre Dreyfus decided to expand the European partnerships of Saviem and the company received a large capital amount from the French State for recapitalisation and modernisation. It also got the Limoges factory, which manufactured diesel engines. Between 1963 and 1966, Saviem moved most of its production from the Paris area to Blainville-sur-Orne and Annonay. In 1967, the Blainville-sur-Orne factory produced 26,000 large goods vehicles and the Annonay factory 1,777 buses/coaches. In 1965, Saviem acquired the French heavy equipment manufacturer Richard-Continental in a bid to compete with Caterpillar.|$|E

The electromagnetically driven clutch-operated differential can be manually locked (VTM-4 Lock) to help the truck better handle adverse terrain or become unstuck. It also has a four-channel fully automatic Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) system {{that is designed to}} enhance control during acceleration, cornering, and collision-avoidance maneuvers and can be manually disabled to prevent undesirable throttle intervention in off-road conditions.|$|E

50|$|After {{it became}} clear that series {{production}} would take place at Lokomotivbau Elektrotechnische Werke Hans Beimler Hennigsdorf, they built a further prototype in 1966 (number V 100 003). This (third and oldest surviving) loco is now owhed by the Berlin-Anhalt Railway Society (Förderverein Berlin-Anhaltische Eisenbahn) in the Martin Luther town of Wittenberg and sports its original livery (cream with green stripes). One year later, production started. In the years that followed, the V 100 replaced almost all state railway locomotives on <b>medium</b> <b>duties</b> and thus hauled all types of train, working all over East Germany. In the 1970 DR fleet renumbering, class V 100 became class 110. The last of the main series of 867 locomotives for DR was built in 1978 (numbers 110 001-171 and 110 201-896).|$|R
