5|$|Contaminants {{that are}} {{discharged}} into {{the marine environment}} accumulate in the bodies of <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> when they are stored unintentionally in their blubber along with energy. Contaminants that {{are found in the}} tissues of <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> include heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, but also organochlorides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For example, these can cause disruptive effects on endocrine systems; impair the reproductive system, and lower the immune system of individuals, leading to a higher number of deaths. Other pollutants such as oil, plastic debris and sewage threaten the livelihood of <b>marine</b> <b>mammals.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>mammals</b> have {{a number}} of {{physiological}} and anatomical features to overcome the unique challenges associated with aquatic living. Some of these features are very species specific. <b>Marine</b> <b>mammals</b> have developed a number of features for efficient locomotion such as torpedo shaped bodies to reduce drag; modified limbs for propulsion and steering; tail flukes and dorsal fins for propulsion and balance. <b>Marine</b> <b>mammals</b> are adept at thermoregulation using dense fur or blubber, circulatory adjustments (counter-current heat exchangers); torpedo shaped bodies, reduced appendages, and large size to prevent heat loss.|$|E
5|$|The fishery {{industry}} {{not only}} threatens <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> through by-catch, but also through competition for food. Large scale fisheries {{have led to}} the depletion of fish stocks that are important prey species for <b>marine</b> <b>mammals.</b> Pinnipeds have been especially affected by the direct loss of food supplies and in some cases the harvesting of fish has led to food shortages or dietary deficiencies, starvation of young, and reduced recruitment into the population. As the fish stocks have been depleted, the competition between <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> and fisheries has sometimes led to conflict. Large-scale culling of populations of <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> by commercial fishers has been initiated {{in a number of areas}} in order to protect fish stocks for human consumption.|$|E

5|$|Vessel strikes cause {{death for}} a number of <b>marine</b> <b>mammals,</b> {{especially}} whales. In particular, fast commercial vessels such as container ships can cause major injuries or death when they collide with <b>marine</b> <b>mammals.</b> Collisions occur both with large commercial vessels and recreational boats and cause injury to whales or smaller cetaceans. The critically endangered North Atlantic right whale is particularly affected by vessel strikes. Tourism boats designed for whale and dolphin watching can also negatively impact on <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> by interfering with their natural behavior.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, the {{aquarium}} {{stated that it}} takes no official position on the controversy of captive killer whales or other cetaceans.

5|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>mammals</b> {{were first}} hunted by {{aboriginal}} peoples {{for food and}} other resources. Many were also the target for commercial industry, leading to {{a sharp decline in}} all populations of exploited species, such as whales and seals. Commercial hunting lead to the extinction of †Steller's sea cow and the †Caribbean monk seal. After commercial hunting ended, some species, such as the gray whale and northern elephant seal, have rebounded in numbers; conversely, other species, such as the North Atlantic right whale, are critically endangered. Other than hunting, <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> can be killed as bycatch from fisheries, where they become entangled in fixed netting and drown or starve. Increased ocean traffic causes collisions between fast ocean vessels and large <b>marine</b> <b>mammals.</b> Habitat degradation also threatens <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> and their ability to find and catch food. Noise pollution, for example, may adversely affect echolocating mammals, and the ongoing effects of global warming degrade arctic environments.|$|E

5|$|Noise {{pollution}} from anthropogenic activities is another major concern for <b>marine</b> <b>mammals.</b> This {{is a problem}} because underwater noise pollution interferes with the abilities of some <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> to communicate, and locate both predators and prey.

They can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. Underwater noise is generated from shipping, the oil and gas industry, research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation. Acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> emit loud and noxious underwater sounds.|$|E

5|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>mammals</b> {{are able}} to dive {{for long periods of}} time. Both {{pinnipeds}} and cetaceans have large and complex blood vessel systems which serve to store oxygen to support deep diving. Other important reservoirs include muscles, blood, and the spleen which all have the capacity to hold a high concentration of oxygen. They are also capable of bradycardia (reduced heart rate), and vasoconstriction (shunting most of the oxygen to vital organs such as the brain and heart) to allow extended diving times and cope with oxygen deprivation. If oxygen is depleted, <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> can access substantial reservoirs of glycogen that support anaerobic glycolysis of the cells involved during conditions of systemic hypoxia associated with prolonged submersion.|$|E
5|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>mammals</b> {{are widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the globe, but their distribution is patchy and coincides with the productivity of the oceans. Species richness peaks at around 40° latitude, both north and south. This corresponds to {{the highest levels of}} primary production around North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. Total species range is highly variable for marine mammal species. On average most <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> have ranges which are equivalent or smaller than one-fifth of the Indian Ocean. The variation observed in range size {{is a result of the}} different ecological requirements of each species and their ability to cope with a broad range of environmental conditions. The high degree of overlap between marine mammal species richness and areas of human impact on the environment is of concern.|$|E

40|$|The {{long-term}} goals {{of this effort}} are to develop a mobile, persistent, passive acoustic monitoring capability in support of Navy environmental monitoring requirements. We aim to demonstrate glider-based <b>marine</b> <b>mammal</b> detection, classification, and localization to provide timely information on <b>marine</b> <b>mammal</b> presence in support of Navy environmental monitoring efforts. An important aspect of this project is quantitative evaluation of glider-based capabilities for passive acoustic monitoring with respect to standard monitoring methods. OBJECTIVES Our objective is to test glider-based passive acoustic monitoring capabilities for <b>marine</b> <b>mammal</b> call detection, classification, and localization (DCL) by collecting glider-based acoustic monitoring data sets within a West Coast naval training range. Because of their mobility, endurance, and acoustically silent operation, gliders provide attractive platforms for acoustic monitoring over {{extended periods of time}} over wide areas, with processing capabilities for detection, classification and localization of <b>marine</b> <b>mammal</b> calls. We have been testing various autonomous platforms (submerged and near-surface) for <b>marine</b> <b>mammal</b> call passive acoustic monitoring, and comparing these platforms against the present standard of passive acoustic monitoring with fixed bottom-mounted acoustic instruments...|$|R
