50|$|The shogunate's {{failure to}} oppose the Western powers angered many Japanese, {{particularly}} those of the southern domains of Chōshū <b>and</b> <b>Satsuma.</b> Many samurai there, inspired by the nationalist doctrines of the kokugaku school, adopted the slogan of sonnō jōi ("revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians"). The two domains {{then went on to}} form an alliance. In August 1866, soon after becoming shogun, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, struggled to maintain power as civil unrest continued. In November 1867, Yoshinobu officially tendered his resignation to the Emperor and he formally stepped down ten days later. The Chōshū <b>and</b> <b>Satsuma</b> domains in 1868 convinced the young Emperor Meiji and his advisors to issue a rescript calling {{for an end to the}} Tokugawa shogunate. The armies of Chōshū <b>and</b> <b>Satsuma</b> soon marched on Edo and the ensuing Boshin War led to the eventual fall of the shogunate.|$|R

5000|$|In 1864, as the Tokugawa shogunate {{began taking}} a hard line, Ryōma fled to Kagoshima in Satsuma Domain, which was {{developing}} {{as a major}} centre for the anti-Tokugawa movement. Ryōma negotiated the secret alliance between Chōshū <b>and</b> <b>Satsuma</b> provinces. <b>Satsuma</b> <b>and</b> Chōshū historically had been irreconcilable enemies, and Ryōma's position as a [...] "neutral outsider" [...] was critical in bridging the gap in trust.|$|R

2500|$|Historically, Satsuma had {{maintained}} an influential {{control over the}} trading routes that bounded the Kyūshū island to the Ryukyu Islands, Mainland Japan and by extension, {{the rest of the}} world. Its commercial importance to the rest of Japan was reflected in the adoption of such terms as Satsuma imo (sweet potato), Satsuma yaki (<b>Satsuma</b> styled pottery), <b>and</b> <b>Satsuma</b> jisho (Japanese-English dictionary). Similar terms such as <b>satsuma</b> ware <b>and</b> <b>satsuma</b> (orange) were also, along with several words from the dialect itself such as soy (Satsugū: そい~しょい [...] ), later incorporated into the English language.|$|R

50|$|Southern Italy {{benefited from}} the {{presence}} and cross fertilization of the Byzantines, the Arabs, and the Normans, while the north was mostly controlled first by the Carolingians. The Normans in Sicily chose to commission Byzantine workshops to decorate their churches such as <b>Monreale</b> <b>and</b> Cefalù Cathedrals where full iconographic programmes of mosaics have survived. Important frescos and illuminated manuscripts were produced.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was born}} in <b>Monreale,</b> <b>and</b> died in Palermo. He {{initially}} trained with his father, a painter and mosaicist. As a young apprentice he was a fellow pupil with Gerardo Asturino. [...] In 1618, he moved to Palermo and apprenticed with Vito Carrera (1555-1623). His first dated work is from 1626: St. Anthony Abbot for the church of Sant' Antonio Abate. The development of his style owed much to Anthony van Dyck, who visited Sicily in 1624 and whose altarpiece, the Madonna of the Rosary in the oratory of Santa Maria del Rosario in Palermo was highly influential for local artists. He was also commissioned works and paintings for many churches in Piana degli Albanesi, and various works to adorn the villas of the Sicilian nobility. Other influences on Novelli were the Caravaggisti or tenebrists active in Naples (for example, Ribera). Novelli also painted for the church of Santa Zita in <b>Monreale,</b> <b>and</b> painted a Marriage of Cana for the refectory of the Benedictines in Monreale.|$|R
