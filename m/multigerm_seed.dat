50|$|By the 1940s, {{progress}} {{was being made}} toward mechanically separating <b>multigerm</b> <b>seed</b> into segmented seed, allowing a reduction in labor-intensive agricultural thinning. Research was being made toward a true monogerm seed by Russian refugees Viacheslav F. Savitsky, Helen Kharetchko Savitsky, and Utah native Forrest Vern Owen. U-I and other sugar companies created the Beet Sugar Development Foundation, with a laboratory in West Jordan. Together with the USDA's Division of Sugar Plant Investigations, they financed a search for naturally occurring monogerm seeds. Two such plants were found, both in Oregon. These were named SLC Monogerm 101 and SLC Monogerm 107. The first commercial monogerm sugar beet resistant to the Curly Top blight was launched in 1955 by U-I, and by 1958 it was in large-scale production.|$|E
30|$|To {{study the}} {{efficiency}} of P. frequentans against C. beticola, field experiments were carried out at the Nubaria Research Station, El-Behera, Governorate, Egypt, during the sugar beet growing seasons 2014 / 15 and 2015 / 16. Seeds of Pleno sugar beet cultivar (<b>multigerm</b> <b>seeds)</b> obtained from Nubaria Sugar Refining Company (NSRC) were sown directly in plots of 3 [*]×[*] 3.5  m 2 arranged in a completely randomized design, with three plots for each treatment as replicates. Sixty days old plants were sprayed by C. beticola spore suspension at the concentration of 1 [*]×[*] 105 spores/ml as mentioned by El-Fawy (2016).|$|R
40|$|Large changes {{introduced}} in the sugar beet production technology in the Vojvodina Province over last 40 years resulted in changes in the etiology and harmfulness of different agents of sugar beet root diseases. Improvements in cultivation practices reduced the harmfulness of some diseases while increased the harmfulness of others. Some disease agents became obsolete, but others gained importance. New agents of root diseases were found. The most frequent damages, persisting {{over long periods of}} time were caused by seedling damping-off, Fusarium root rot, charcoal root rot, parasitic (Rhizomania) and non-parasitic root bearding. The parasitic damping-off caused by several fungal species but most frequently by Phoma betae occurred at the time when <b>multigerm</b> <b>seeds</b> were used in combination with extensive cultural practices. The agents of seedling diseases completely lost their significance as the consequence of switching to fungicide - treated monogerm seeds, earlier planting and improved soil tillage. In the period of intensive use of agricultural chemicals, seedling damping-off occurred frequently due to the phytotoxic action of chemicals (insecticides, herbicides and mineral fertilizers). In some years, frosts caused damping- off of sugar beet seedlings on a large scale in the Vojvodina Province. Poor sugar beet germination and emergence were frequently due to spring droughts. Sometimes they were due to strong winds. The occurrence of Fusarium root rot and charcoal root rot intensified on poor soils. Fusariosis symptoms were exhibited as plant wilting and different forms of root rot. In recent years root tip rot has occurred frequently in the first part of the growing season causing necrosis and dying of plants. Lateral roots tended to proliferate from the healthy tissue, giving the root a bearded appearance similar to Rhizomania. Fusarium oxysporum was the most frequent agent of this fusariosis. F. graminearum, F. equiseti, F. solani have also been identified in recent years as the agent of root rot, but its importance was much lower. Charcoal root rot and plant wilting (Macrophomina phaseolina) have caused extensive damages in sugar beets, especially under the conditions of severe drought and high temperatures in summer. In some years, it was the dominant agent of root rot. Mixed infections caused by fungi from the genera Fusarium and M. phaseolina were encountered frequently. The extent of damage caused by these diseases was reduced by improved pro- duction technology. Rhizomania of sugar beet (caused by beet necrotic yellow vein virus) was identified in Serbia in the 1970 s. Results of recent investigations have shown that BNYVV is widespread in Vojvodina, since the virus was found on 36, 7 % (24, 674 ha) of acreages from 67, 213 ha of total sugar beet acreages inspected on incidence of BNYVV in the period from 1997 to 2004 year. In the last few years, the occurrence of Rhizoctonia root rot (Rhizoctonia solani) was registered in some localities in Vojvodina...|$|R
