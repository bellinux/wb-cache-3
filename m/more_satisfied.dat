5|$|On 16 December 1999, NSB {{confirmed}} the option for another six Class 73 trains, costing NOK680 million, {{for use on}} the Østfold Line. On 7 January 2000, the trains were put into service on the Dovre Line between Oslo and Trondheim, and on the Sørland Line between Kristiansand and Stavanger. The travel time from Trondheim to Oslo was 5 hours and 46 minutes. In an independent marketing survey, Signatur customers were <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> than the customers for the two main airlines, Braathens and Scandinavian Airlines, but the train service had a lower reputation than the airlines. By May, the number of passengers on the Sørland Line had fallen by 10 percent. The reason was the limited capacity during the weekends; while NSB had previously run trains with 400 to 500 seats, Class 73 had considerably less capacity. Additional services were introduced on the Dovre Line from 11 June 2000, while the introduction on the Bergen Line was delayed because the infrastructure upgrades on the Bergen Line were not yet completed.|$|E

25|$|David R. Hekman {{and colleagues}} {{found that men}} receive {{significantly}} higher customer satisfaction scores than equally well-performing women. Customers who viewed videos featuring a female and a male actor {{playing the role of}} an employee helping a customer were 19% <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> with the male employee's performance and also were <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> with the store's cleanliness and appearance although the actors performed identically, read the same script, and were in exactly the same location with identical camera angles and lighting. In a second study, they found that male doctors were rated as more approachable and competent than equally well performing female doctors. They interpret their findings to suggest that customer ratings tend to be inconsistent with objective indicators of performance and should not be uncritically used to determine pay and promotion opportunities. They contend that customer biases have potential adverse effects on female employees' careers.|$|E

Furthermore, articulated dissenters, compared to latent dissenters, were perceived to be less verbally aggressive.|$|E

25|$|These {{professionals}} typically conceptualize, create, consult, and supervise. As a result, {{upper middle}} class employees enjoy great autonomy {{in the work place}} and are <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> with their careers than non-professional middle class individuals. In terms of financial wealth income, the professional middle class fits in the top third, but seldom reach the top 5% of American society. According to sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert, James Henslin, Joseph Hickey, and William Thompson, the {{upper middle class}} constitutes 15% of the population.|$|E
25|$|Working-class Americans {{as well as}} many {{of those}} in the middle class may also face {{occupation}} alienation. In contrast to upper-middle-class professionals who are mostly hired to conceptualize, supervise and share their thoughts, many Americans enjoy only little autonomy or creative latitude in the workplace. As a result, white collar professionals tend to be significantly <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> with their work. More recently those {{in the center of the}} income strata, who may still identify as middle class, have faced increasing economic insecurity, supporting the idea of a working-class majority.|$|E

Serving as his personal tribute to the cartoon and jazz music, Vahnke claims to have been <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> with his work on Papa Woody than on any Vampire Rodents album. A collaboration with Athan Maroulis called Alchemia, later renamed Obsidian, was planned for release in 1997 but never came into fruition. The overall project {{was described as a}} SBC and LTG approach to The Blue Nile with string orchestra. Also, a completely instrumental Vampire Rodent album was completed the same year, but like the Alcemia/Obsidian project was shelved indefinitely.|$|E

500|$|David has no {{obligation}} {{to share with the}} Finley & Figg partners the proceeds of this case, which was his own initiative. However, his sense of loyalty prevents him from leaving an ailing firm and ailing fellows in the lurch. David returns to the office and tells Oscar and Wally of his settlement. He offers to pay the debts left from the Krayoxx fiasco, amounting to $200,000 and pays off the mortgage on the firm's office building, gives the loyal secretary Rochelle a $100,000 bonus and splits the remaining $1.2 million evenly with them (a far more generous settlement than they planned to give him, had the Krayoxx money come in). In return, the three of them are to sign a 12-month contract to enter an equal partnership and will no longer be an ambulance-chasing firm. A bit embarrassed, Oscar and Wally agree to the new contract. However, the two of them can't really function under these new terms, and later that year the partnership falls apart. Finley begins spending less time in the office and eventually retires a happy man, having recently remarried and being much <b>more</b> <b>satisfied</b> with his new wife, while Figg packs up and moves to Alaska.

40|$|This study {{responds}} {{to calls for}} research on work-family aspects in entrepreneurship research. Our study examined the role of work-family conflict and enhancement on small business owners’ (SBOs) wellbeing. We found work-family has negative direct effect on mental health, job and family satisfactions. Furthermore, we found that under high level of work-family conflict condition, SBOs who perceive a greater level of work-family enhancement would feel <b>more</b> <b>satisfy</b> with their life, job as well as family aspects. Interestingly, under high level of conflict, even SBOs perceive greater level of enhancement, it would not lessen {{the negative impact of}} the conflict on their mental health. These results suggest that once psychological health is harmed by work-family conflict, its negative consequences remain unchanged...|$|R
