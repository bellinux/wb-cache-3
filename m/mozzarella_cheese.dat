The company's 1992 offering, a Meatloaf Specialty Sandwich, was introduced {{as part of}} a push into limited table service. Other LTO variants in its Specialty Sandwich line included an Italian sausage sandwich served in one of three ways: with onions and peppers; parmigiana-style with <b>mozzarella</b> <b>cheese</b> and marinara sauce; or with all four ingredients. Steak sandwiches were made from steak fillets or later, restructured beef. Other offerings were a ham and cheese sandwich with mayonnaise, lettuce, and tomato, and a veal parmigiana sandwich.|$|E
5|$|A grilled Italian sausage {{sandwich}} {{was sold}} in 1992 and was served with onions and peppers or parmigiana style with <b>mozzarella</b> <b>cheese</b> and marinara sauce. As part of the company's BK Dinner Baskets promotion in 1993, the chain introduced a grilled meatloaf sandwich with ketchup and onions in the United States. In 2013, Burger King sold a bratwurst sandwich in a regional limited time offering in the US states of Wisconsin and Illinois. The sandwich featured a bratwurst manufactured by Johnsonville Foods, raw onion and yellow mustard. Despite being discontinued, versions of the steak sandwich have been re-released several times since the 1970s. The BK Dinner baskets featured a steak sandwich, and in 2003 Burger King New Zealand introduced the Big Bloke Steak Sandwich which was almost identical to the 1979 sandwich.|$|E

The specimens were dried in a critical point drying apparatus, fractured at room temperature (∼ 20 °C), sputter coated with gold, and images of the cheese specimens taken using a scanning electron microscope. The images showed clear internal structures of the specimens. The compact protein structure of cheeses interspersed with small and large voids representing locations of the fat and serum phases, respectively, was seen. The exopolysaccharide produced by the streptococci appeared to be delicate and filamentous. The lactobacilli seemed to produce the exopolysaccharide in meagre amounts.

40|$|Cell {{numbers of}} {{presumptive}} {{lactic acid bacteria}} varied markedly between 7 natural whey starter cultures (NWSC) used for producing traditional cows' milk <b>Mozzarella</b> <b>cheeses</b> in the Apulia region of Southern Italy. Taxonomic identification revealed a large diversity at species level, including mesophilic and thermophilic lactobacilli, lactococci, streptococci and enterococci. Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD-PCR), analysis showed the biodiversity among the strains and, for lactobacilli, some relationships with provenience of the natural starter. Cell numbers of presumptive lactic acid bacteria in the corresponding <b>Mozzarella</b> <b>cheeses</b> were similar or higher than {{those found in the}} corresponding NWSC. RAPD-PCR analyses showed that most of the strains in cheese originated from the starter. The gross composition varied markedly between the 7 <b>Mozzarella</b> <b>cheeses</b> and ranged from 53 - 64 % moisture, 17 - 23 % protein, 13 - 20 % fat and 0. 50 - 1. 61 % salt. The values of pH for several samples were above 6. 0. As shown by urea-PAGE of the pH 4. 6 -insoluble nitrogen fractions, cheese samples were characterized by differences in αs 1 - and p-casein hydrolysis. Cheeses also differed with respect to secondary proteolysis as shown by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of data from RP-HPLC of the pH 4. 6 -soluble, pH 4. 6 - 70 % ethanol-soluble and 70 % ethanol-insoluble nitrogen fractions. These differences were attributed to the different microbial composition of the NWSC. Strain selection and optimization of a protocol for producing a natural whey starter culture to be used by dairy factories of the Apulia region appears to be a pre-requisite to standardize the major traits distinguishing this cheese variety...|$|R

40|$|Changes in {{molecular}} {{mobility of}} water in pasta filata and non-pasta filata <b>Mozzarella</b> <b>cheeses</b> were investi-gated during the first 10 d of storage using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation techniques. Wa-ter in pasta filata Mozzarella was classified into two fractions by spin-spin relaxation times, T 21 and T 22, and corresponding proton intensities, A 1 and A 2, represent-ing low and high molecular mobility, respectively. In-crease in A 1 (and decrease in A 2) suggested that, there was a redistribution of water from more- to less-mobile fraction (from T 22 to T 21 fraction) during the first 10 d of storage. The NMR data did not indicate the two-state behavior of water molecules in non-pasta filata Mozzarella. However, the T 2 values of non-pasta filata Mozzarella were comparable to the T 21 values of pasta filata Mozzarella indicating that the molecular mobility {{of water in}} non-pasta filata Mozzarella is {{comparable to that of}} the less mobile water fraction in pasta filata Mozzarella. Generally, T 2 and T 1 values of pasta filata and non-pasta filata <b>Mozzarella</b> <b>cheeses</b> increased dur-ing the 10 -d storage.

In this study <b>mozzarella</b> <b>cheeses</b> were manufactured with a range of compositions and production processes to give three groups of cheeses with different fat contents, draining pH or calcium contents, and stretching conditions, i. e. stretching temperature and speed. Principal Component Analysis was applied to the analysis of correlations within each group of cheese samples.

40|$|In {{this study}} texture and melting {{characteristics}} of full fat <b>Mozzarella</b> <b>cheeses</b> {{were compared with}} nonfat cheeses made with two levels (1 % and 2. 5 %) of maltodextrin (Maltrin® M 100) fat replacer. Cheeses with skim milk without any fat replacer were also made for comparison. All the 4 batches of cheeses were stored at 4 °C for 29 days. Texture analysis including hardness, cohesiveness, springiness and meltability were measured at day 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29. Values for hardness and springiness were significantly higher in the nonfat cheeses compared to the full fat cheese. The hardness and springiness values decreased during storage. The full fat cheese had the highest meltability measured as flow distance in millimetre. There was an improvement in melting properties of all cheeses during storage. The cheese containing 2. 5 % Maltrin® showed the best melting properties among the nonfat cheeses, suggesting that the addition of fat replacer may improve meltability of nonfat cheeses. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
