The analytical study presented includes elastic coupling between inplane and out-of-plane deflections {{as a function of}} <b>geometric</b> <b>pitch</b> between the plane of rotation and the principal axes of inertia of each blade. The numerical evaluation is based on a transient analysis using lumped masses and elastic substructure techniques.

40|$|When {{comparing}} the citation impact of nations, departments or {{other groups of}} researchers within individual fields, three approaches have been proposed: arithmetic <b>means,</b> <b>geometric</b> <b>means,</b> and percentage in the top X%. This article compares the precision of these statistics using 97 trillion experimentally simulated citation counts from 6875 sets of different parameters (although all having the same scale parameter) based upon the discretised lognormal distribution with limits from 1000 repetitions for each parameter set. The {{results show that the}} <b>geometric</b> <b>mean</b> is the most precise, closely followed by the percentage of a country's articles in the top 50 % most cited articles for a field, year and document type. Thus the <b>geometric</b> <b>mean</b> citation count is recommended for future citation-based comparisons between nations. The percentage of a country's articles in the top 1 % most cited is a particularly imprecise indicator and is not recommended for international comparisons based on individual fields. Moreover, whereas standard confidence interval formulae for the <b>geometric</b> <b>mean</b> appear to be accurate, confidence interval formulae are less accurate and consistent for percentile indicators.
