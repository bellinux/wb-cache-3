500|$|Eon Productions had {{originally}} planned to follow The Spy Who Loved <b>Me</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> adaptation of For Your Eyes Only, [...] although this plan changed {{within weeks of}} the 1977 release, following the box office success of the 1977 space-themed film Star Wars. With a budget of $34million Moonraker cost more than double any of the previous Bond films, although both Broccoli and United Artists agreed to the costs because of the profits from The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E
500|$|On 23 September 2004, Brosnan {{became a}} citizen of the United States, but {{retained}} his Irish citizenship. Brosnan said that [...] "my Irishness is in everything I do. It's the spirit of who I am, as a man, an actor, a father. It's where I come from." [...] Brosnan was asked by a fan if it annoyed him when people get his nationality confused. He said: [...] "It amuses me in some respects that they should confuse <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> Englishman when I'm dyed-in-the-wool, born and bred Irishman... I don't necessarily fly under any flag. But no, it doesn't bother me." ...|$|E
500|$|Those encountering Alkan at {{this phase}} {{included}} the young Vincent d'Indy, who recalled Alkan's [...] "skinny, hooked fingers" [...] playing Bach on an Érard pedal piano: [...] "I listened, riveted {{to the spot}} by the expressive, crystal-clear playing." [...] Alkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata, of which d'Indy said: [...] "What happened to the great Beethovenian poem... I couldn't begin to describe– above all in the Arioso and the Fugue, where the melody, penetrating the mystery of Death itself, climbs up to a blaze of light, affected <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> excess of enthusiasm such as I have never experienced since. This was not Liszt—perhaps less perfect, technically—but it had greater intimacy and was more humanly moving..." ...|$|E
50|$|My soul shall {{rejoice in}} the Lord, for He has clothed <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> robe of {{salvation}} and covered <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tunic of happiness; He has crowned me as a bridegroom and adorned <b>me</b> <b>with</b> jewels as <b>a</b> bride.|$|R

500|$|Warrack emphasises that Holst {{acquired}} an instinctive understanding—perhaps {{more so than}} any English composer—of the importance of folksong. In it he found [...] "a new concept not only of how melody might be organized, but of what the implications were {{for the development of}} a mature artistic language". Holst did not found or lead a school of composition; nevertheless, he exercised influences over both contemporaries and successors. According to Short, Vaughan Williams described Holst as [...] "the greatest influence on my music", although Matthews asserts that each influenced the other equally. Among later composers, Michael Tippett is acknowledged by Short as Holst's [...] "most significant artistic successor", both in terms of compositional style and because Tippett, who succeeded Holst as director of music at Morley College, maintained the spirit of Holst's music there. Of an early encounter with Holst, Tippett later wrote: [...] "Holst seemed to look right inside <b>me,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> acute spiritual vision". Kennedy observes that [...] "a new generation of listeners... recognized in Holst the fount of much that they admired in the music of Britten and Tippett". Holst's pupil Edmund Rubbra acknowledged how he and other younger English composers had adopted Holst's economy of style: [...] "With what enthusiasm did we pare down our music to the very bone".|$|E
500|$|Imprisoned with 25 fellow conspirators, Castro renamed [...] "The Movement" [...] the [...] "26th of July Movement" [...] (MR-26-7) {{in memory}} of the Moncada attack's date. Forming a school for prisoners, the Abel Santamaría Ideological Academy, Castro {{organized}} five hours a day of teaching in ancient and modern history, philosophy and English. He read widely, enjoying the works of Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and Martí but also reading books by Freud, Kant, Shakespeare, Munthe, Maugham and Dostoyevsky, analyzing them within a Marxist framework. He began reading about Roosevelt's New Deal, believing that something similar should be enacted in Cuba. Corresponding with supporters outside of prison, he maintained control over the Movement and organized the publication of History Will Absolve <b>Me,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> initial print run of 27,500 copies. Initially permitted a relatively high amount of freedom within the prison compared to other inmates, he was locked up in solitary confinement after his comrades sang anti-Batista songs on a visit by the President in February 1954. Meanwhile, Castro's wife Mirta gained employment in the Ministry of the Interior, having been encouraged to do so by her brother, a friend and ally of Batista's. This was kept a secret from Castro, who found out through a radio announcement. Appalled, he raged that he would rather die [...] "a thousand times" [...] than [...] "suffer impotently from such an insult". Both Fidel and Mirta initiated divorce proceedings, with Mirta taking custody of their son Fidelito; this angered Castro, who did not want his son growing up in a bourgeois environment.|$|E

He just said, [...] "Tom Walley {{would be proud}} of you". Tom was my youth team manager at Watford and absolutely hated people being out of shape... It was a gentle hint, but I realised... I had to sort it out myself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally {{affiliated}} with the centrist to centre-left Liberal Party, and with a northern, non-conformist circulation base, the paper earned a national reputation and {{the respect of the}} left during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). George Orwell writes in Homage to Catalonia: [...] "Of our larger papers, the Manchester Guardian {{is the only one that}} leaves <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> increased respect for its honesty". With the pro-Liberal News Chronicle, the Labour-supporting Daily Herald, the Communist Party's Daily Worker and several Sunday and weekly papers, it supported the Republican government against General Francisco Franco's insurgent nationalists.|$|E
