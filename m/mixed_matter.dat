60|$|It {{is obvious}} that the {{insecurity}} of the Lancastrian usurper, largely because he was a usurper, is the clue to many things, some of which we should now call good, some bad, all of which we should probably call good or bad with the excessive facility with which we dismiss distant things. It led the Lancastrian House to lean on Parliament, which was the <b>mixed</b> <b>matter</b> we have already seen. It may have been in some ways good for the monarchy, to be checked and challenged by an institution which at least kept something of the old freshness and freedom of speech. It was almost certainly bad for the parliament, making it yet more the ally of the mere ambitious noble, of which we shall see much later. It also led the Lancastrian House to lean on patriotism, which was perhaps more popular; to make English the tongue of the court for the first time, and to reopen the French wars with the fine flag-waving of Agincourt. It led it again to lean on the Church, or rather, perhaps, on the higher clergy, and that in the least worthy aspect of clericalism. A certain morbidity which more and more darkened the end of mediævalism showed itself in new and more careful cruelties against the last crop of heresies. A slight knowledge of the philosophy of these heresies will lend little support to the notion that they were in themselves prophetic of the Reformation. It {{is hard to see how}} anybody can call Wycliffe a Protestant unless he calls Palagius or Arius a Protestant; and if John Ball was a Reformer, Latimer was not a Reformer. But though the new heresies did not even hint at the beginning of English Protestantism, they did, perhaps, hint at the end of English Catholicism. Cobham did not light a candle to be handed on to Nonconformist chapels; but Arundel did light a torch, and put it to his own church. Such real unpopularity as did in time attach to the old religious system, and which afterwards became a true national tradition against Mary, was doubtless started by the diseased energy of these fifteenth-century bishops. Persecution can be a philosophy, and a defensible philosophy, but with some of these men persecution was rather a perversion. Across the channel, one of them was presiding at the trial of Joan of Arc.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{possible}} creation of mixed hadron-quark-gluon matter, that can arise at nuclear or heavy-ion collisions, is addressed. It is shown that there can exist several different kinds of such a <b>mixed</b> <b>matter.</b> The main types of this matter can be classified onto macroscopic mixture, mesoscopic mixture, and microscopic mixture. Different types of these mixtures require principally different descriptions. Before comparing theoretical results with experiments, one has to analyze thermodynamic stability of all these mixed states, classifying them onto unstable, metastable, and stable. Only the most stable mixed state should be compared with experiment. Mixed states {{also need to be}} checked with regard to stratification instability. In addition to the static stratification instability, there can happen dynamic instability occurring in a mixture of components moving with respect to each other.

If the <b>mixed</b> <b>matter</b> is mixed hadron–quark phase, nucleon outgoing from hadronic phase and ingoing to quark phase probably reduces the system to a non-equilibrium state, in other words, there exists the imbalance of the two phases when deconfinement takes place. This novel non-equilibrium process is very analogous to the nuclear reactions that nuclei emit neutrons and absorb them under appropriate conditions. We present self-consistent thermodynamics in description for the processes and identify the microphysics responsible for the processes. The microphysics is an inevitable consequence of non-linear phase structure instead {{of the effect of}} an additional dissipation force.

40|$|We {{construct}} an {{equation of state}} including the hadron-quark phase transition. The mixed phase is obtained by the Gibbs conditions for finite temperature. We adopt the equation of state based on the relativistic mean field theory for the hadronic phase taking into account pions. As for the quark phase, the MIT bag model of the deconfined 3 -flavor strange quark matter is used. As a result, our equation of state is thermodynamically stable and exhibits qualitatively the desired properties of hadron-quark <b>mixed</b> <b>matter,</b> such as the temperature dependence of the transition density. The pions raise the transition density because they make the equation of state softer. Using the equation of state constructed here, we study its astrophysical implications. The maximum mass of compact stars is investigated, and our equation of state is consistent with recent observations. We also compute {{the collapse of a}} massive star with 100 solar masses using our equation of state and find that the interval time from the bounce to the black hole formation becomes shorter for the model with pions and quarks. The pions and quarks affect the total energy of the emitted neutrinos because the duration time of the neutrino emission becomes shorter. The neutrino luminosity rises under the effect of pions since the density of the proto-neutron star becomes high. Comment: 8 figures, accepted for publication in PR...|$|E
40|$|Observations {{have ruled}} out the {{presence}} of significant amounts of antimatter in the Universe on scales ranging from the solar system, to the Galaxy, to groups and clusters of galaxies, and even to distances comparable to {{the scale of the}} present horizon. Except for the model-dependent constraints on the largest scales, the most significant upper limits to diffuse antimatter in the Universe are those on the Mpc scale of clusters of galaxies provided by the EGRET upper bounds to annihilation gamma-rays from galaxy clusters whose intra-cluster gas is revealed through its x-ray emission. On the scale of individual clusters of galaxies the upper bounds to the fraction of <b>mixed</b> <b>matter</b> and antimatter for the 55 clusters from a flux-limited x-ray survey range from < 5 x 10 ^(- 9) to < 1 x 10 ^(- 6), strongly suggesting that individual clusters of galaxies are made entirely of matter or, of antimatter. X-ray and gamma-ray observations of colliding clusters of galaxies, such as the Bullet Cluster, permit these constraints to be extended to even larger scales. If the observations of the Bullet Cluster, where the upper bound to the antimatter fraction is found to be < 3 x 10 ^- 6, can be generalized to other colliding clusters of galaxies, cosmologically significant amounts of antimatter will be excluded on scales of order 20 Mpc (5 x 10 ^(15) M_Sun).

40|$|We explore general scalar-tensor {{models in}} the {{presence}} of a kinetic <b>mixing</b> between <b>matter</b> and the scalar field, which we call Kinetic <b>Matter</b> <b>Mixing.</b> In the frame where gravity is de-mixed from the scalar this is due to disformal couplings of matter species to the gravitational sector, with disformal coefficients that depend on the gradient of the scalar field. In the frame where matter is minimally coupled, it originates from the so-called beyond Horndeski quadratic Lagrangian. We extend the Effective Theory of Interacting Dark Energy by allowing disformal coupling coefficients to depend on the gradient of the scalar field as well. In this very general approach, we derive the conditions to avoid ghost and gradient instabilities and we define Kinetic <b>Matter</b> <b>Mixing</b> independently of the frame metric used to described the action. We study its phenomenological consequences for a ΛCDM background evolution, first analytically on small scales.
