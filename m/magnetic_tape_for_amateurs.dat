50|$|Cellulose acetate <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> was {{introduced}} by IBM in 1952 for use on their IBM 726 tape drive in the IBM 701 computer. It was much lighter and easier to handle than the metal tape introduced by UNIVAC in 1951 for use on their UNISERVO tape drive in the UNIVAC I computer.

5000|$|Offline storage/archives data, {{which is}} when data is stored to an optical disk or <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>for</b> archival {{purposes}} because {{it was determined that}} the chance of needing access to the data is low. In this case, access is slower than near-line data because it requires manual retrieval. The speed of accessing such data can take days depending on storage facility arrangements.|$|R

In 2012 a secure email transfer system was implemented as an interim measure until the new SDT system was completed. Once this was done the secure email transfer option was removed.|$|R
40|$|The Wind Information Display System (WINDS) {{provides}} {{flexible control}} through system-user interaction for collecting wind shear data, processing this data in real time, displaying the processed data, storing raw data on <b>magnetic</b> <b>tapes,</b> and post-processing raw data. The data are received from two asynchronous laser Doppler velocimeters (LDV's) and include position, velocity and intensity information.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{is described in}} which temperature (density) and velocity are measured separately but simultaneously as functions of time {{so that it is}} possible to determine the relationships among velocity, density, and the product of density and velocity. Temperatures were measured with a dual-wire thermocouple probe. Velocity data were supplied by a fringe laser-Doppler anemometer. Signals from thermocouples and the laser were recorded on FM <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>for</b> later processing...|$|R
50|$|Initially, <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>for</b> {{data storage}} was wound on 10.5 in reels. This de facto {{standard}} for large computer systems persisted through the late 1980s. Tape cartridges and cassettes were available {{as early as the}} mid-1970s and were frequently used with small computer systems. With the introduction of the IBM 3480 cartridge in 1984, large computer systems started to move away from open reel tapes and towards cartridges.|$|R

50|$|The IBM 726 dual <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> reader/recorder <b>for</b> the IBM 701 was {{announced}} on May 21, 1952. Unlike later IBM 7 track drives, the 726 could read backwards {{as well as}} forwards.|$|R
50|$|Recording Media Group International (also {{known as}} RMGi) was a Dutch {{manufacturer}} of <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> products based in Oosterhout. This plant was initially built by Philips in 1968, and spun {{off into a}} joint venture with DuPont, PDM (Philips Dupont Magnetics, B.V.) which lasted until 1993. At this point, SK Germany (?) took over the plant and named the company Magnetic Products Oosterhout B.V.. In 2004, the company became known by its current name after acquiring equipment, processes, and talent from EMTEC's Munich plant. For its entire existence, the factory has produced <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>for</b> recording analog audio or video.|$|R
