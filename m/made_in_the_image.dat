5|$|Although Christ, like man, is <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of God, {{he alone}} shares the {{likeness}} of God the Father. Christ is both sinless and apathetic, and thus by striving to imitate Christ, man can achieve salvation. To Clement, sin is involuntary, and thus irrational , removed only through {{the wisdom of the}} Logos. God's guidance of us away from sin is thus a manifestation of God's universal love for mankind. The word play on λόγος and αλόγον is characteristic of Clement's writing, and may be rooted in the Epicurean belief that relationships between words are deeply reflective of relationships between the objects they signify.|$|E
5|$|The Platonic {{influence}} on Maximus' thought {{can be seen}} most clearly in his theological anthropology. Here, Maximus adopted the Platonic model of exitus-reditus (exit and return), teaching that humanity was <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of God, {{and the purpose of}} salvation is to restore us to unity with God. This emphasis on divinization or theosis helped secure Maximus' place in Eastern theology, as these concepts have always held an important place in Eastern Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Teachers of the {{doctrine}} focus on personal empowerment, promoting a positive view of the spirit and body. They maintain that Christians have been given power over creation because they are <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of God and teach that positive confession allows Christians to exercise dominion over their souls and material objects around them. Leaders of the movement view the atonement as providing for the alleviation of sickness, poverty, and spiritual corruption; poverty and illness are cast as curses {{which can be broken}} by faith and righteous actions. There are, however, some prosperity churches which seek a more moderate or reformed paradigm of prosperity. Kirbyjon Caldwell, pastor of a Methodist mega-church, supports a theology of abundant life, teaching prosperity for the whole human being, which he sees as a path to combating poverty.|$|E

25|$|Regarding {{questions}} about the scientific accuracy of the Genesis account of creation, and about various viewpoints concerning evolution, the Orthodox Church has not dogmatized any particular view.

Traditionally, the lantern has been used to symbolize fertility, and functioned mainly as a toy and decoration. But today the lantern has come to symbolize the festival itself. In the old days, lanterns were <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of natural things, myths, and local cultures. Over time, a greater variety of lanterns could be found as local cultures became influenced by their neighbors.|$|E

500|$|The filmmakers {{created the}} size of each robot with {{the size of}} their vehicle mode in mind, {{supporting}} the Transformer's rationale for their choice of disguise on Earth. The concept of traveling protoforms was developed by Roberto Orci when he wondered why [...] "aliens who moonlight as vehicles need other vehicles to travel". This reflected a desire to move to a more alien look, away from the [...] "blocky" [...] Transformers. Another major influence in the designs was samurai armor, returning full-circle to the Japanese origins of the toy line.

Besides this, there were two rings fitted around the celestial sphere outside, having the sun and moon threaded on them, and these were made to move in circling orbit... And they made a wooden casing the surface of which represented the horizon, since the instrument was half sunk in it. It permitted the exact determinations {{of the time of}} dawns and dusks, full and new moons, tarrying and hurrying. Moreover, there were two wooden jacks standing on the horizon surface, having one a bell and the other a drum in front of it, the bell being struck automatically to indicate the hours, and the drum being beaten automatically to indicate the quarters. All these motions were brought about by machinery within the casing, each depending on wheels and shafts, hooks, pins and interlocking rods, stopping devices and locks checking mutually.|$|E
500|$|The {{constitution}} of the Byzantine Empire {{was based on the}} conviction that it was the earthly copy of the Kingdom of Heaven. Just as God ruled in Heaven, so the Emperor, made in his image, should rule on earth and carry out his commandments... It saw itself as a universal empire. Ideally, it should embrace all the peoples of the Earth who, ideally, should all be members of the one true Christian Church, its own Orthodox Church. Just as man was made in God's image, so man's kingdom on Earth was <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of the Kingdom of Heaven." [...] The survival of the Empire in the East assured an active role of the Emperor in the affairs of the Church. The Byzantine state inherited from pagan times the administrative, and financial routine of administering religious affairs, and this routine was applied to the Christian Church. Following the pattern set by Eusebius of Caesarea, the Byzantines viewed the Emperor as a representative or messenger of Christ, responsible particularly for the propagation of Christianity among pagans, and for the [...] "externals" [...] of the religion, such as administration and finances. As Cyril Mango points out, the Byzantine political thinking can be summarised in the motto [...] "One God, one empire, one religion".|$|E

However, as a result of humanity's rebellion against God (the Fall), humanity has tended to adopt a more animalistic view of sexual activity which is not true to the ultimate transfigurable nature of the human race, having been <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Divine <b>image</b> and likeness.|$|R

2500|$|As an Evangelical, Poythress advocates the complete, divine {{authority}} of the Bible. As a Calvinist, he places great emphasis the sovereignty of God and adopts the Neo-Calvinist theme that Jesus is Lord over every sphere of human existence, not just private or religious life. He makes use of Biblical theology {{in the tradition of}} Geerhardus Vos, and builds on Meredith G. Kline's work in Images of the Spirit to argue that [...] "imaging" [...] is a pattern in the Bible beyond man and woman being <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of God. He has a decidedly positive view of the Old Testament Law, though he rejects theonomy and Christian Reconstructionism, and he also rejects the hermeneutics of dispensationalism in favor of traditionally Reformed covenant theology. In Christian eschatology, he advocates an Augustinian amillennial perspective (compare the summary of Christian eschatological differences).|$|E
2500|$|Branden Fitelson of the University of California, Berkeley and Elliott Sober of the University of Wisconsin–Madison {{argue that}} Plantinga must {{show that the}} {{combination}} of evolution and naturalism also defeats the more modest claim that [...] "at least a non-negligible minority of our beliefs are true", and that defects such as cognitive bias are nonetheless consistent with being <b>made</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of a rational God. Whereas evolutionary science already acknowledges that cognitive processes are unreliable, including the fallibility of the scientific enterprise itself, Plantinga's hyperbolic doubt is no more a defeater for naturalism than it is for theistic metaphysics founded upon a non-deceiving God who designed the human mind: [...] " [...] can construct a non-question-begging argument that refutes global skepticism." [...] Plantinga's argument has also been criticized by philosopher Daniel Dennett and historian Richard Carrier who argue that a cognitive apparatus for truth-finding can result from natural selection.|$|E
