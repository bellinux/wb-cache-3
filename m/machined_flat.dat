When defining a digitizing procedure {{of this type}} of features, two approaches could be applied: discrete or continuous scanning. Discrete Scanning (D) is performed with a static sensor, but the information for each single measurement comes from a constrained area. On the other hand, since Continuous Scanning (C) is carried out with a moving sensor, the information for each single measurement comes from a swept area. In this work, a comparison between these two approaches, when digitizing with a Conoscopic Holography sensor, is performed. The main objective is to establish their influence upon surface reconstruction quality and, thereafter, upon measurement reliability...|$|E

40|$|Use of full-matrix capture (FMC) {{combined}} with the total focusing method (TFM), {{has been shown to}} provide improvements to flaw sensitivity within components of irregular geometry. Ultrasonic immersion inspection of aerospace discs requires strict specifications to ensure full coverage – one of which is that all surfaces should be <b>machined</b> <b>flat.</b> The ability to detect defects through curved surfaces, with an equivalent sensitivity to that obtained through flat surfaces could bring many advantages. In this work, the relationship between surface curvature and sensitivity to standard defects is quantified for various front wall radii. Phased array FMC immersion inspection of curved components was simulated using finite element modelling, then visualized using surface-compensated focusing techniques. This includes the use of BRAIN software developed at the University of Bristol, and cuART developed by the University of Strathclyde. Modelling results were compared to experimental data from a series of test blocks with a range of curvatures, containing standard defects. The sensitivity to defects is evaluated by comparing the performance to conventional methods. Results are used to highlight the benefits and limitations of these methods relating to the application area of aerospace engine disc forgings...|$|E
40|$|Conoscopic {{holography}} (CH) is a non-contact interferometric {{technique used}} for surface digitization which presents several advantages over other optical {{techniques such as}} laser triangulation. Among others, the ability for the reconstruction of high-sloped surfaces stands out, and so does its lower dependence on surface optical properties. Nevertheless, similarly to other optical systems, adjustment of CH sensors requires an adequate selection of configuration parameters for ensuring a high quality surface digitizing. This should be done on a surface located {{as close as possible}} to the stand-off distance by tuning frequency (F) and power (P) until the quality indicators Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and signal envelope (Total) meet proper values. However, not all the points of an actual surface are located at the stand-off distance, but they could be located throughout the whole working range (WR). Thus, the quality of a digitized surface may not be uniform. The present work analyses how the quality of a reconstructed surface is affected by its relative position within the WR under different combinations of the parameters F and P. Experiments have been conducted on AISI 316 wire EDM <b>machined</b> <b>flat</b> surfaces. The number of high-quality points digitized as well as distance measurements between different surfaces throughout the WR allowed for comparing the metrological behaviour of the CH sensor with respect to a touch probe (TP) on a CMM...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Primary heat {{dissipation}} method of IC Chip is still air-cooling at present. This paper presents a new machining method of air-cooled plate fin heat sinks, namely orthogonal planing. The surface of plate fins machined by this method are rough enough to augment its specific surface area; the rough surface can also disturb laminar sub-layer of turbulent thermal boundary layer, thus the thermal resistances of thermal boundary layer are reduced. Therefore, {{heat dissipation}} efficiency of heat sink {{can be enhanced}} further. The focus of plate fin heat sinks forming by orthogonal planing is how to <b>machine</b> <b>flat</b> chips. A new pattern of chip curl that is called down-curl can be observed when rake angle of tool is rather large and cutting thickness is very thin. As cutting thickness increases, down-curl chips become flat and then up-curling. There is a transition area that chips are not curled between down- and up-curl. The conditions that chips are not curled are obtained through investigating influences of rake angle and cutting thickness on chip curl, and flat plate fins with rough surface are produced...|$|R
40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to improve the {{mechanical}} properties of the composites with knitted performs by introducing horizontal strands in the course direction in a flat-bed knitting <b>machine.</b> <b>Flat</b> knitted performs were produced with different proportions of axial inlay strands and the composite laminates were prepared using the vacuum-assisted resin transfer moulding technique. It is observed that the introduction of inlay strands influences the structure of the knitted preform by increasing course density, wale density and thickness. This result in the increased anisotropic behaviour of the composite laminate showing increased strength in the course direction and decreased strength in the wale direction. The flexural strength of the knitted preform composites increases in both wale and course directions with the introduction of inlay strands. Laminates from preforms with two inlays exhibit overall improved impact properties whereas those from preforms with one inlay show higher impact damage tolerance index. These observations are explained in terms of the change in fibre architecture brought about by the introduction of the inlay strands...|$|R
5000|$|Functional {{programming}} {{languages are}} typically less efficient {{in their use}} of CPU and memory than imperative languages such as C and Pascal. [...] This is related to the fact that some mutable data structures like arrays have a very straightforward implementation using present hardware (which is a highly evolved Turing <b>machine).</b> <b>Flat</b> arrays may be accessed very efficiently with deeply pipelined CPUs, prefetched efficiently through caches (with no complex pointer chasing), or handled with SIMD instructions. [...] It is also not easy to create their equally efficient general-purpose immutable counterparts. For purely functional languages, the worst-case slowdown is logarithmic in the number of memory cells used, because mutable memory can be represented by a purely functional data structure with logarithmic access time (such as a balanced tree). However, such slowdowns are not universal. For programs that perform intensive numerical computations, functional languages such as OCaml and Clean are only slightly slower than C according to The Computer Language Benchmarks Game. For programs that handle large matrices and multidimensional databases, array functional languages (such as J and K) were designed with speed optimizations.|$|R

To extract more energy from the wind we need to increase the wind turbine size. However, the increase in size has begun to reach a limit in terms of material composition and structural stability.

In normal manufacturing practice, the surfaces of BK 7 components undergoes a series of manufacturing operations, such as grinding, polishing and lapping, in order to obtain nanometric finish with high optical quality.
