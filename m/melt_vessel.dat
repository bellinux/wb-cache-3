In support of the lead–bismuth coolant feasibility, the main advantages and specific features of its application are presented, taking into account significant experience acquired in Russia in handling this coolant (nuclear submarines reactor units and circulation loops), availability of job-proved methods and equipment for the coolant quality control, coolant properties ensuring fire and explosion safety and heat removal capability under high temperature and low pressure conditions.

Additions can be added at the still-hot liquid stage, such as fragrance, fragrant essential oils, moisturizing agents, colorants, or exfoliating agents, e.g. poppy seeds, coffee grounds or pumice, along with coloured micas, metallic glitter, honey and flower heads. The liquified concoction can be poured into individual molds, tray molds, or blocks. Molds are made of metal or, more commonly, from reinforced silicone rubber, allowing artisans to make their own molds using a two-part mold kit. Upon cooling, the soap can be removed from the molds as individual soaps, or as blocks for slicing into bars. Layers of different colors, or transparent layers, can be built up, or pre-cast embeddable soap shapes, called embeds, can be set into the soap during moulding to produce novel patterns. Melt and pour bases can be transparent or opaque, and are sometimes enriched with products like goat's milk or shea butter to add value. The small-scale process lends itself to bespoke manufacture; a single soap bar can be individually manufactured if desired.|$|R

40|$|MAAP 4 is a {{computer}} code that can simulate the response of a light water reactor power plant during severe accident sequences, including actions taken as part of accident management. The code quantitatively predicts {{the evolution of a}} severe accident starting from full power conditions given a set of system faults and initiating events through events such as core <b>melt,</b> reactor <b>vessel</b> failure, and containment failure. Furthermore, models are included in the code to represent the actions that could mitigate the accident by in-vessel cooling, external cooling of the reactor pressure vessel, or cooling the debris in containment. A key element tied to using a code like MAAP 4 is an uncertainty analysis. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a MAAP 4 based analysis to examine the sensitivity of a key parameter, in this case hydrogen production, to a set of model parameters that are related to a Level 2 PRA analysis. The Level 2 analysis examines those sequences that result in core melting and subsequent reactor pressure vessel failure and its impact on the containment. This paper identifies individual contributors and MAAP 4 model parameters that statistically influence hydrogen production. Hydrogen generation was chosen because of its direct relationship to oxidation. With greater oxidation, more heat is added to the core region and relocation (core slump) should occur faster. This, in theory, would lead to shorter failure times and subsequent “hotter” debris pool on the containment floor...|$|R
40|$|Alpine glaciers {{situated}} in mid- and low latitudes are valuable archives for paleoclimatology. They offer a continuous record of recent local climatic conditions in regions {{where the majority}} of humankind lived and still lives. For meaningful interpretation of an ice core from such an archive, accurate dating is essential. Usually, several complementary approaches are used to establish a depth-age relationship. The oldest part of the ice {{at the bottom of the}} ice core suffers annual layer thinning and is influenced by small-scale bedrock geometry, which limits the use of annual layer counting or the assignment of reference horizons for dating. Nuclear dating techniques overcome this restriction since they do not rely on the preservation of a resolvable stratigraphy by using the continuous record of the respective radioisotope. Radiocarbon is especially powerful for dating alpine glaciers because its half-life of 5730 years suitably allows it to cover the typical age range of these archives. Most important, glacier ice does contain minute amounts of carbon. While macrofossils can only be found by coincidence, organic aerosols deposited on the glacier offer the best source of contemporary carbon in glacier ice. Despite a large part of its chemical composition being unknown, organic carbon found in an ice sample can be operationally classified into a particulate fraction (POC) and a dissolved fraction (DOC). Radiocarbon dating of POC has proven to be very successful and is a routine application by now. The major limitation of this technique is the low POC concentration found especially in pre-industrial and polar ice samples. Therefore, the DOC fraction promises even better suitability for dating thanks to its by a factor of 5 to 10 higher concentrations. Nevertheless, a straightforward analysis of DOC is hampered by its vulnerability to contamination. DOC consists in large part of mono- and dicarboxylic acids - compounds that can easily be taken up from the surrounding gas phase during sample preparation or which are dissolved from surfaces in contact with the liquid sample. Hence it is vital to ensure ultra-clean sample preparation with a low and stable procedural blank for reliable radiocarbon analysis of DOC from glacier ice. In this work, we developed an extraction system for DOC from glacier ice samples. To meet the requirements of ultra-clean and effcient carbon extraction, the complete sample treatment is performed in inert gas conditions and only dedicated materials are chosen for the individual components of the setup. Ice samples are pre-cleaned and melted in a <b>melting</b> <b>vessel.</b> POC is separated from the liquid sample by filtration during the transfer to the photo-reactor. The sample is acidified and inorganic carbon is degassed from the solution. A minimal invasive photo-oxidation method is applied by means of external UV irradiation of the sample. This converts the DOC to CO 2, which is degassed, cleaned and captured in cryogenic traps. The CO 2 is quantified to determine the initial DOC concentration and is sampled to glass vials. With state-of-the-art accelerator mass spectrometry, the gaseous CO 2 sample is directly analysed for its radiocarbon content to yield the age of the ice sample. Following a detailed description of the extraction system hardware and its operation protocol, we show the results of its extensive characterisation. The setup can process ice samples of up to 400 g mass. Within 45 min of irradiation time, oxalic acid was oxidised and recovered as CO 2 with an efficiency of (85 ± 7) ...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{the impact}} that <b>melt</b> {{relocation}} and <b>vessel</b> failure may have on subsequent progression and associated consequences of a Light Water Reactor (LWR) accident, {{it is important to}} accurately predict heating and relocation of materials within the reactor vessel, heat transfer to and from the reactor vessel, and the potential for failure of the vessel and structures within it. Accurate predictions of such phenomena require high temperature thermal and structural properties. However, a review of vessel and structural steel material properties used in severe accident analysis codes reveals that the required high temperature material properties are extrapolated with little, if any, data above 1000 K. To reduce uncertainties in predictions relying upon extrapolated high temperature data, Idaho National Laboratory (INL) obtained high data for two metals used in LWR vessels: SA 533 Grade B, Class 1 (SA 533 B 1) low alloy steel, which is used to fabricate most US LWR reactor vessels; and Type 304 Stainless Steel SS 304, which is used in LWR vessel piping, penetration tubes, and internal structures.

40|$|In {{the very}} {{unlikely}} {{event of a}} severe reactor accident involving core <b>melt</b> and pressure <b>vessel</b> failure, {{it is important to}} identify the circumstances that would allow the molten core material to cool down and resolidify, bringing core debris to a coolable s ate.

In this situation the molten pool becomes a three phase mixture: e. g., a solid and liquid slurry formed by the molten pool as it cools to a temperature below the temperature of liquidus, agitated by the gases formed in the concrete ablation process. The present work quantifies the partition of the heat losses upward and downward in this multi-layered configuration, considering the influence of the viscosity and the solid fraction in the pool, from data obtained from an intermediate scale experimental facility that has been developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

It is especially worth mentioning the workshop on 'Process Control and Condition Monitoring in Chemical Plants' that was {{conducted for the}} first time, and the concluding conference of the DFG Innovationskolleg 'Magneto-Hydrodynamics of Electrically Conducting Fluids'. At the ROCOM test facility (Rossendorf Coolant Mixing facility), a large series of experiments was performed dedicated to coolant mixing phenomena in PWRs during boron dilution and cold water transients. CFD models were validated against those experiments and a so called semi-analytical mixing model was developed. By coupling that semi-analytical model with the DYN 3 D reactor dynamics code it could be shown that a shut down reactor gets re-critical when a plug of 36 m" 3 deionated water enters the core after switching on the first main coolant pump. However, that deionated plug {{does not lead to}} non-allowed high coolant pressure or fuel temperatures. The behavior of a RPV lower callotte during a severe accident with melt slumping into the lower plenum is studied in 1 : 10 test at Royal Institute of Technology Stockholm. At the ISR computational methods were developed for pre- and post-test calculations of those experiments in order to predict the time and mode of RPV failure. The temperature, as well as location, and time of the RPV failure were found in good agreement with the experiment. Two patents resulted from those studies. One of them proposes a creep stool to mechanically support the RPV deformed by creeping, and the flooding of the reactor pit for ex vessel cooling of the <b>melt</b> inside the <b>vessel.</b> Such measures extend the time till RPV failure and offer the possibility for additional accident management procedures that can prevent the RPV meltthrough.

The ISTC was to support non-proliferation of sensitive knowledge and technologies in biological, chemical and nuclear domains by engaging scientists in peaceful research programmes with a broad international cooperation. The main forms of ISTC activity are Research projects and Supporting programs. In the Research projects informal contact expert groups (CEG) were set up by ISTC to improve coordination between adjacent projects and to encourage international collaboration: first of all by the European Commission. The CEG members - experts from the national institutes - evaluated and managed the projects‘ scientific results from initial stage of proposal formulation until the final reporting. They were often involved directly in the project‘s details by joining the Steering Committees of the project.

40|$|Considering the {{unlikely}} core melt down scenario {{for a light}} water reactor (LWR) a possible failure mode of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) and its failure time has to be investigated for a determination of the loadings on the containment. Worldwide several experiments have been performed accompanied with material properties evaluation, theoretical, and numerical work. At the Institute of Safety Research of the FZR a finite element model has been de-veloped simulating the thermal processes and the viscoplastic behaviour of the ves-sel wall. An advanced model for creep and material damage has been established and has been validated using experimental data. The thermal and the mechanical calculations are sequentially and recursively coupled. The model is capable of evalu-ating fracture time and fracture position of a vessel with an internally heated melt pool. The model was applied to pre- and post test calculations for the FOREVER test se-ries representing the lower head RPV of a PWR in the geometrical scale of 1 : 10. These experiments were performed at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stock-holm. The results of the calculations can be summarised as follows: # The creeping process {{is caused by the}} simultaneous presence of high tem-perature (> 600 °C) and pressure (> 1 MPa) # The hot focus region is the most endangered zone exhibiting the highest creep strain rates. # The exact level of temperature and pressure has an influence on the vessel failure time but not on the failure position # The failure time can be predicted with an uncertainty of 20 to 25 %. This uncer-tainty is caused by the large scatter and the high temperature sensitivity of the viscoplastic properties of the RPV steel. # Contrary to the hot focus region, the lower centre of the vessel head exhibits a higher strength because of the lower temperatures in this zone. The lower part moves down without significant deformation. Therefore it can be assumed, that the vessel failure can be retarded or prevented by supporting this range. # The development of a gap between <b>melt</b> crust and <b>vessel</b> wall could not be proofed. First calculations for a PWR geometry were performed to work out differences and commonalities between prototypic scenarios and scaled experiments. The results of the FOREVER-experiments cannot be transferred directly to PWR geometry. The geometrical, mechanical and thermal relations cannot be scaled in the same way. Because of the significantly higher temperature level, a partial ablation of the vessel wall has to be to expected in the PWR scenario, which is not the case in the FOREVER tests. But nevertheless the FOREVER tests are the only integral in-vessel retention experiments up to now and they led to a number of important insights about the behaviour of a vessel under the loading of a melt pool and pressure...|$|R
50|$|For {{both the}} {{practical}} application and {{scientific study of}} chalcogenide glasses, glass purity is of utmost importance. Varying levels of trace impurities, even at levels of a few parts per million can alter the spectroscopic behavior of a glass. Similarly, impurities are a major concern for optical components. Impurities in the raw materials and hence in the resulting glass, contribute {{to the loss of}} power through an optical component, whether it {{is in the form of}} a long glass fiber or an infrared window. These impurities contribute to the optical loss through absorption and scattering as well as serving as nucleation sites for crystallization.Although high purity raw elements are now commercially available, with 99.9999% purity routine for many metals, even this level of purity is often not sufficient, particularly for optical fiber applications.More of a concern are commercially available chalcogenide compounds such as germanium sulfide, gallium sulfide or arsenic sulfide. Although these may have been synthesized from high purity elements, the conversion process itself can readily introduce oxide, water or organic impurities. It is not unheard of to find for example, commercial gallium sulphide contaminated with 45% or more gallium oxide through incomplete reaction of the precursors during production.The conventional method for producing chalcogenide glasses is through the use of sealed ampoule melting. In this technique the required glass precursor materials are sealed under vacuum in a silica ampoule, melted, and then quenched to form a glass within the ampoule. The requirement for the sealed atmosphere is dictated by the volatile nature of many of the precursors which if melted in open atmosphere can result in large compositional changes or complete removal of components with low vapour pressures. This process also has the effect of trapping any impurities in the precursors within the glass as thus the precursor purity limitsthe ultimate quality of the glass that is produced. In addition, impurities can be transferred to the glass from the ampoule walls.The closed nature of the process leads to tightly controlled quality. In addition to the open and closed systems for glass melting,chalcogenide chemical vapour deposition is emerging as a method to produce high quality chalcogenide glass, in both thin film and bulk glass form. Gallium lanthanum sulfide glasses use essentially non-volatile components La2S3, La2O3 and Ga2S3 to form the basic glass with glass modifiers added as needed. This allows melting in an open atmosphere, under a flowing inert gas, typically argon. Batches of the compounds are prepared in a nitrogen-purged glovebox, placed in a vitreous carbon crucible and transferred to a silica tube furnace in a sealed <b>vessel.</b> <b>Melting</b> is typically at 1150 °C for 24 hours. The molten gallium sulfides fluxed the lanthanum compounds and incorporated them into the melt at temperatures much lower than their respective melting points. The viscosity of the melt is low enough, at approximately 1 poise to allow full mixing without the need for a rocking furnace which is required for melting in an ampoule. The melt is normally quenched to glass by pushing it into a water cooled jacket. An advantage of melting in an open atmosphere is the ability of volatile impurities to boil off and be carried away, a significant advantage over sealed systems. For example, no SH- impurity is observed in the absorption spectra of Ga-La-S glasses, compared to very significant quantities in sulphide glasses melted by the sealed ampoule technique.|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the outcome}} of the EU “Stress Tests” in 2012, several areas for further {{research}} in the field of Severe Accident Management have been identified for different types of NPPs. One of these areas concerns the feasibility of In <b>Vessel</b> <b>Melt</b> Retention (IVMR) for VVER 1000 reactors. Ensuring that the corium could stay in the RPV (like it happened during the TMI- 2 accident) during a Severe Accident would reduce significantly the loads on the last barrier (the containment) and therefore reduce the risk of release of Fission Products to the environment for most of the Severe Accident Scenarios. This type of Severe Accident Management strategy has already been incorporated in the SAMGs of several operating small size Light Water Reactors (reactor below 500 MWe (like VVER 440)) and is {{part of the}} SAMG strategies for some Gen III+ PWRs like the AP 1000. Starting from 2012, several research institutes and utilities in Europe (and also in the Russian Federation) started some work on this topic. The preliminary results of these first investigations highlighted that large uncertainties (especially in the area of modelling activities) were existing regarding IVMR for VVER 1000. This highlighted the need to start an activity supporting the assessment of these uncertainties and one way envisaged was to set up an international benchmark on computer code calculations for “In Vessel Retention for VVER 1000 ”. JRC-IET was asked by UJV Rez a. s to organize this international benchmark on computer code calculations for “In Vessel Retention for VVER 1000 ” with the target of providing preliminary results on the feasibility of this mitigation strategy in case of severe accident for such kind of plants. This benchmark attracted right from the beginning the interest of many EU and non EU partners. Kurchatov Institute provided freely to all partners the necessary data (ASTEC dataset, Severe Accident initial conditions, etc…) to start their own calculations, and to benchmark them with the one already performed at KI. In the meantime the interested for this topic has continued to grow and several other EU institutions joined this benchmark especially because the subject of IVMR is also applicable for other types of NPPs, expanding the work as initially planned. A larger project on the topic was prepared in 2014 and proposed to the H 2020 call NFRP- 01 - 2014 : “Improved safety design and operation of fission reactors”, in order to expand the level of knowledge reached so far. The report is broken down into seven main Chapters and three appendixes. • Chapter 1 provides background information for this activity and expected results defined by the participants; • Chapter 2 provides a general description of In-Vessel Melt Retention (IVMR) principle; • Chapter 3 provides a short description of the VVER- 1000 and VVER- 440 design, focussing especially on those details regarding IVMR. It includes general pictures and a detailed picture of the VVER- 1000 Lower Head (metallic structure, core barrel, etc…); • Chapter 4 describes the existing calculations carried out mainly by KI that constituted a starting point of this benchmark, including useful references; • Chapter 5 is the core of this report, explaining how the calculations were carried out, analysing and comparing the results. Two kinds of codes were used: CFD (CFX, NEPTUNE CFD, RELAP- 3 D) and mechanistic / lumped parameters codes (ASTEC, SOCRAT, MAAP, PROCOR, MELCOR); • Chapter 6 presents existing approaches of IVMR for AP 1000 and other NPPs to demonstrate its applicability and summarizes past experiments on the topic; • Chapter 7 summarizes the findings identified in the benchmark and discusses the remaining open issues; • Appendixes collect individual calculation reports, first round of calculations, and a description of main models used by every code.
