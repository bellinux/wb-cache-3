25|$|The human {{mammary gland}} is {{composed}} of several cell types, including adipose (fat cells), muscle, ductal epithelium, and mammary epithelium (referred to sometimes as lactocytes). The mammary epithelium is the site for excretion of raw materials into the milk supply, including choline. This occurs, for the fat portion of the milk, by apocrine secretion, where vacuoles containing materials bud off the cell into the lumen (storage) of the alveolus (<b>milk</b> <b>secretion</b> gland). From here the milk will be released upon stimulation with oxytocin via suckling.|$|E

40|$|Large {{variation}} in bovine milk composition of Dutch Holstein cows has been observed. The factors influencing the <b>milk</b> synthesis and <b>secretion</b> {{process in the}} mammary gland and the variations in this process lead to {{variation in}} milk composition. The understanding of milk synthesis was improved during the last decades, however, much is still unknown, {{especially with regard to}} lipid synthesis and secretion. In this research, a proteomics technique (FASP-Dimethyl labeling-NanoLC-Orbitrap-MS/MS) was used to identify and quantify low abundant proteins in milk. By using this proteomics technique combined with a metabolomics technique (1 H-NMR), the variation in <b>milk</b> synthesis and <b>secretion</b> processes were shown as affected by several factors influencing milk composition: DGAT 1 polymorphism, fat globule size and energy balance of the cow. Stomatin, cholesterol and cholesterol synthesis enzymes were shown to be important for <b>milk</b> synthesis and <b>secretion</b> in lactating cows in all the different studies.

The extrusion process consists of two asynchronous events: clearing of membrane particles (probably including integral membrane proteins) and bulging of the apical plasma membrane.

30|$|Scyphocephalium ochocoa (S. ochocoa) {{belongs to}} the family of Myristicaceae and {{widespread}} in the littoral forests of Niger, Cameroon and Gabon [1]. Its vernacular names in Gabon are: Soghe, Sogho (Fang), Ossoko (Myene), Musuku (Nzebi, Punu-Shira), Otsoko, Soko (Tsogo) [2]. For its therapeutic and nutritional virtues, several populations of Central Africa use this plant. In Congo, a bark decoction is used for vaginal injection against female infertility. In a steam bath, mixing its leaves with those of Microdermis puberula, Costus afer, Macaranga barteri and Chorophora excelsa is used against febrile body aches [3]. It is also used as a decoction against gonorrhea or with salt and chili pepper [2]. In Gabon, the seeds of S. ochocoa are eaten grilled or looted. In traditional Gabonese medicine, a bark decoction is used in the treatment of anemia. As a drink, this decoction is used against rheumatism, joint pain, body aches and disorders of ovulation. The bark, dried and kneaded with white clay, serves to stop excessive <b>milk</b> <b>secretions.</b> This plant is also used in the treatment of several cancers: breast, stomach, skin and liver cancer.|$|R

40|$|Lipid in {{the diet}} is known to enhance <b>milk</b> fat <b>secretion</b> and alter <b>milk</b> fatty acid {{composition}} in lactating goats. In the current experiment, the contribution of peripheral tissue and mammary gland lipid metabolism to changes in milk fat composition from plant oils was examined. Fourteen Alpine goats in midlactation were used in a 3 x 3 Latin square design with 28 -d experimental periods. Treatments comprised maize silage-based diets containing no additional oil (M), sunflower-seed oil (MSO; 6. 1 % of diet DM), or linseed oil (MLO; 6. 2 % of diet DM). Compared with the control, milk yield was greater in goats fed MSO (3. 37 and 3. 62 kg/d, respectively), whereas MLO enhanced milk fat content (+ 3. 9 g/kg), resulting in a 14 % increase in <b>milk</b> fat <b>secretion.</b> Both MSO and MLO increased <b>milk</b> lactose <b>secretion</b> by 12 and 8 %, respectively, compared with M. Relative to the control, plant oils decreased C 10 to C 16 secretion (32 and 24 %, respectively, for MSO and MLO) and enhanced C 18 output in milk (ca. 110 %). Diets MSO and MLO increased cis- 9 18 : 1 <b>secretion</b> in <b>milk</b> by 25 and 31 %, respectively, compared with M. The outputs of trans- 11 18 : 1 and cis- 9, trans- 11 18 : 2 in milk were increased 8. 34 - and 6. 02 -fold for MSO and 5. 58 - and 3. 71 -fold for MLO compared with M, and MSO increased trans- 10 18 : 1 and trans- 10, cis- 12 18 : 2 secretion. Plant oils decreased milk fat cis- 9 14 : 1 / 14 : 0; cis- 9 16 : 1 / 16 : 0; cis- 9 18 : 1 / 18 : 0; and cis- 9, trans- 11 18 : 2 /trans- 11 18 : 1 concentration ratios but {{had no effect on}} mammary stearoyl-CoA desaturase mRNA or activity. Furthermore, changes in <b>milk</b> fatty acid <b>secretion</b> were not associated with alterations in mammary acetyl-CoA carboxylase mRNA and activity, abundance of mRNA encoding for lipoprotein lipase and fatty acid synthase, or malic enzyme and glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase activity in mammary tissue. Mammary lipoprotein lipase activity was increased with MSO relative to MLO. Treatments had no effect on glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase activity, or mRNA abundance and/or activity of lipoprotein lipase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase in liver or adipose tissue. In conclusion, inclusion of sunflower-seed oil and linseed oil in maize silage-based diets alters <b>milk</b> fatty acid <b>secretion</b> in goats via mechanisms independent of changes in mammary, hepatic, or adipose tissue lipogenic gene expression. Furthermore, data provided indications that the regulation of mammary lipogenic responses to plant oils on starch-rich diets differs between the caprine and bovine. Peer reviewe...|$|R

5000|$|Secretory alveoli develop {{mainly in}} pregnancy, when rising levels of prolactin, estrogen, and {{progesterone}} cause further branching, {{together with an}} increase in adipose tissue and a richer blood flow. In gestation, serum progesterone remains at a stably high concentration so signaling through its receptor is continuously activated. As one of the transcribed genes, Wnts secreted from mammary epithelial cells act paracrinely to induce more neighboring cells' branching. When the lactiferous duct tree is almost ready, [...] "leaves" [...] alveoli are differentiated from luminal epithelial cells and added {{at the end of each}} branch. In late pregnancy and for the first few days after giving birth, colostrum is secreted. <b>Milk</b> <b>secretion</b> (lactation) begins a few days later due to reduction in circulating progesterone and the presence of another important hormone prolactin, which mediates further alveologenesis, milk protein production, and regulates osmotic balance and tight junction function. Laminin and collagen in myoepithelial basement membrane interacting with beta-1 integrin on epithelial surface again, is essential in this process. Their binding ensures correct placement of prolactin receptors on the basal lateral side of alveoli cells and directional secretion of milk into lactiferous ducts. Suckling of the baby causes release of the hormone oxytocin, which stimulates contraction of the myoepithelial cells. In this combined control from ECM and systemic hormones, <b>milk</b> <b>secretion</b> can be reciprocally amplified so as to provide enough nutrition for the baby.|$|E

40|$|The {{molecular}} mechanism underlying <b>milk</b> {{fat globule}} <b>secretion</b> in mammary epithelial cells ostensibly involves {{the formation of}} complexes between plasma membrane butyrophilin and cytosolic xanthine oxidoreductase. These complexes bind adipophilin in the phospholipid monolayer of milk secretory granules, the precursors of milk fat globules, enveloping the nascent fat globules in a layer of plasma membrane and pinching them off the cell. However, using freeze-fracture immunocytochemistry, we find these proteins in locations other than those previously inferred. Significantly, butyrophilin in the residual plasma membrane of the fat globule envelope is concentrated in a network of ridges that are tightly apposed to the monolayer derived from the secretory granule, and the ridges coincide with butyrophilin labeling in the globule monolayer. Therefore, we propose that <b>milk</b> fat globule <b>secretion</b> is controlled by interactions between plasma membrane butyrophilin and butyrophilin in the secretory granule phospholipid monolayer rather than binding of butyrophilin–xanthine oxidoreductase complexes to secretory granule adipophilin...|$|R
