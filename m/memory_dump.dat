Joy reunites with a despondent Sadness and manages {{to get them to}} Headquarters, only to discover that Anger's idea has disabled the console, rendering Riley apathetic. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, who is able to successfully extract the idea, reactivating the console and prompting Riley to return home.|$|E
25|$|Post-mortem {{debugging}} is debugging of {{the program}} after it has already crashed. Related techniques often include various tracing techniques (for example,) and/or analysis of <b>memory</b> <b>dump</b> (or core dump) of the crashed process. The dump of the process could be obtained automatically by the system (for example, when process has terminated due to an unhandled exception), or by a programmer-inserted instruction, or manually by the interactive user.|$|E

Given that cryptographic material in <b>memory</b> <b>dumps</b> makes carving techniques ineï¬ƒcient, we introduce a methodology to distinguish meaningful information from cryptographic material in smallsized <b>memory</b> <b>dumps.</b> The proposed methodology uses an adaptive boosting technique with statistical tests.

25|$|Rootkit {{detection}} {{is difficult}} because a rootkit {{may be able to}} subvert the software that is intended to find it. Detection methods include using an alternative and trusted operating system, behavioral-based methods, signature scanning, difference scanning, and <b>memory</b> <b>dump</b> analysis. Removal can be complicated or practically impossible, especially in cases where the rootkit resides in the kernel; reinstallation of the operating system may be the only available solution to the problem. When dealing with firmware rootkits, removal may require hardware replacement, or specialized equipment.|$|E

Hibernation and resumption are much faster as memory pages are compressed using an improved algorithm; compression is overlapped with disk writes, unused memory pages are freed and DMA transfers are used during I/O. hiberfil.sys contains further information including processor state. This file was documented by a security researcher Matthieu Suiche during Black Hat Briefings 2008 who {{also provided a}} computer forensics framework to manage and convert this file into a readable <b>memory</b> <b>dump.</b> The compression algorithm was later documented by Microsoft as well.|$|E
500|$|Joy and Sadness {{encounter}} Bing Bong, Riley's childhood imaginary friend, who suggests {{riding the}} {{train of thought}} back to Headquarters. The three eventually catch the train, but it is halted when Riley falls asleep. They succeed in manipulating Riley's dreams to wake her and restart the train, but it is derailed when the [...] "Honesty Island" [...] collapses (when Riley steals her mother's credit card and begins to run away). In desperation, Joy tries to ride a [...] "recall tube" [...] back to Headquarters, but abandons Sadness since close proximity to Sadness will cause the core memories to turn sad, which Joy believes will hurt Riley. But as she takes off, the ground below the tube collapses, breaking the tube and plunging Joy and Bing Bong into the <b>Memory</b> <b>Dump.</b> At the bottom, Joy then begins to lose hope and breaks into tears and cries, but discovers a sad memory of a ice hockey game that became happy when Riley's parents and friends comforted her. Joy realizes that Sadness serves an important purpose: to create empathy in others when Riley is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help.|$|E

40|$|Researchers in {{the field}} of cloud {{forensics}} need to move away from insisting on acquiring all data - as has historically been the case in computer forensicsand yet still be able to prove the accuracy, sufficiency and soundness of partially acquired data. Virtualization is considered {{to be one of the}} main pillars in providing cloud services. In some cases, investigators might end up having to rely on suspect Virtual Machine (VM) snapshots in the form of <b>memory</b> <b>dumps</b> and user activity logs. Then, in these cases the main challenge is to analyse these <b>memory</b> <b>dumps</b> without altering the evidence. In this paper, after assessing static and live forensics tool in examining cloud based snapshot, we propose a forensic process model based on the NIST model to examine the private cloud based VM snapshots (e. g.
