25|$|MOFs {{might prove}} useful for both {{photochemical}} and polymerization reactions {{due to the}} tuneability of {{the size and shape}} of their pores. A 3D MOF { • 4DMF • H2O} (bpdc: biphenyldicarboxylate, bpy: 4,4′-bipyridine) was synthesized by Li and coworkers. Using this MOF photochemistry of o-methyl dibenzyl ketone (o-MeDBK) was extensively studied. This molecule was found to have a variety of photochemical reaction properties including the production of cyclopentanol. MOFs have been used to study polymerization in the confined space of MOF channels. Polymerization reactions in confined space might have different properties than polymerization in open space. Styrene, divinylbenzene, substituted acetylenes, <b>methyl</b> <b>methacrylate,</b> and vinyl acetate have all been studied by Kitagawa and coworkers as possible activated monomers for radical polymerization. Due to the different linker size the MOF channel size could be tunable on the order of roughly 25 and 100 Å2. The channels were shown to stabilize propagating radicals and suppress termination reactions when used as radical polymerization sites.|$|E

The resulting brush-like triblock copolymers were characterized by H- 1 NMR and size exclusion chromatography. Self-assembly behavior of the copolymers in deionized water was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The critical aggregation concentration ranged from 50 to 160 mg L- 1 depending on the composition. The diameter of the nanoparticles (NPs) was determined by DLS and TEM. Images showed that these nano-sized objects displayed spherical and worm-like morphology with a length increasing with the hydrophilic content. Preliminary studies of drug loading and drug release with a water-insoluble model drug, namely curcumin, showed that these NPs are potential candidates for drug delivery carriers...|$|R

2500|$|The first {{acrylic acid}} {{was created in}} 1843. Methacrylic acid, derived from acrylic acid, was {{formulated}} in 1865. The reaction between methacrylic acid and methanol results in the ester <b>methyl</b> <b>methacrylate.</b> Polymethyl methacrylate was discovered in the early 1930s by British chemists Rowland Hill and John Crawford at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in England. ICI registered the product under the trademark Perspex. About the same time, chemist and industrialist Otto Röhm of Rohm and Haas AG in Germany attempted to produce safety glass by polymerizing <b>methyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> between two layers of glass. The polymer separated from the glass as a clear plastic sheet, which Röhm gave the trademarked name Plexiglas in 1933. Both Perspex and Plexiglas were commercialized in the late 1930s. In the United States, E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (now DuPont Company) subsequently introduced its own product under the trademark Lucite. In 1936 Imperial Chemical Industries (now Lucite International) began the first commercially viable production of acrylic safety glass. During World War II both Allied and Axis forces used acrylic glass for submarine periscopes and aircraft windshields, canopies, and gun turrets. [...] Airplane pilots whose eyes were damaged by flying shards of PMMA fared much better than those injured by standard glass, demonstrating better compatibility between human tissue and PMMA than glass. Civilian applications followed after the war.|$|E

2500|$|In {{orthopedic}} surgery, PMMA {{bone cement}} {{is used to}} affix implants and to remodel lost bone. It is supplied as a powder with liquid <b>methyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> (MMA). Although PMMA is biologically compatible, MMA {{is considered to be}} an irritant and a possible carcinogen. PMMA has also been linked to cardiopulmonary events in the operating room due to hypotension. Bone cement acts like a grout and not so much like a glue in arthroplasty. Although sticky, it does not bond to either the bone or the implant, it primarily fills the spaces between the prosthesis and the bone preventing motion. A disadvantage of this bone cement is that it heats up to [...] while setting that may cause thermal necrosis of neighboring tissue. A careful balance of initiators and monomers is needed to reduce the rate of polymerization, and thus the heat generated. A major consideration when using PMMA cement is the effect of stress shielding. Since PMMA has a Young's modulus between 1.8 and 3.1 GPa, which is lower than that of natural bone (around 14 GPa for human cortical bone), the stresses are loaded into the cement and so the bone no longer receives the mechanical signals to continue bone remodeling and so resorption will occur.|$|E
