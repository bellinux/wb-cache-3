25|$|The Screaming Wiener was {{designed}} and built by Walter Burke, Irv Culver and Wallace Neugent in 1938 as an improved version of the Dingbat. The aircraft is made from wood, with the fuselage a wooden <b>monocoque</b> <b>structure</b> and the wings and tail surfaces wooden structures covered in doped aircraft fabric covering.|$|E
25|$|The PT-22's {{fuselage}} is {{a simple}} <b>monocoque</b> <b>structure,</b> with thick gauge alclad skin. The wings feature spruce spars, aluminum alloy ribs, steel compression members, with aircraft fabric covering aft to the trailing edge and aluminum alloy sheet covering from the leading edge to the spar. The wings have 4° 10' of sweep back, 3° of incidence and 4° 30' dihedral.|$|E
25|$|The Dornier D.I was one {{of several}} designs by Claude Dornier to have an {{all-metal}} stressed skin <b>monocoque</b> <b>structure,</b> {{and it was the first}} fighter to feature such construction and although production was cancelled prior to the completion of any production versions, it was also the first aircraft with these features to go into production. To reduce the hazards of inflight fires, it also had an external fuel tank, which, according to some sources may have been jettisonable, and thick-section cantilevered wings for improved aerodynamics. The Dornier Do H Falke was developed from it, but had an enlarged upper wing and dispensed with the lower wing.|$|E
50|$|Due to wartime {{scarcity}} of aluminum, the de Havilland Mosquito fighter-bomber was built from wood—plywood facings bonded to a balsawood core and formed using molds to produce <b>monocoque</b> <b>structures,</b> {{leading to the}} development of metal-to-metal bonding used later for the de Havilland Comet and Fokker F27 and F28.|$|R

50|$|The {{location}} of the neutral plane {{can be an important}} factor in <b>monocoque</b> <b>structures</b> and pressure vessels. If the structure is a membrane supported by strength ribs, then placing the skin along the neutral surface avoids either compression or tension forces upon it. If the skin is already under external pressure, then this reduces the total force to which it is subject.|$|R
25|$|Weight-saving was a {{priority}} across the aircraft; the airframe, {{other than the}} steel tube engine mount and cowling, featured a wooden rectangular <b>monocoque</b> <b>structure.</b> It had a glued plywood skin, fixed to the mahogany longerons and struts forming the internal structure, which was faired throughout {{to result in a}} low-drag extensions. A conventional fixed undercarriage was used; it had been deemed of greater importance to reduce the aircraft's weight than its drag, thus a retractable undercarriage was seen as counterproductive. The wings, which were constructed in three sections, had a center section integral with the fuselage; the internal structure used three main spars with plywood webs and mahogany flanges, which were covered with plywood sheeting.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} is of all-metal construction, with cantilever mid-wings with detachable tips. The {{leading edges}} are swept-back, and the stressed-skin wings have flaps inboard of the ailerons. The fuselage is a <b>monocoque</b> <b>structure,</b> with a hinged nose to allow loading of a stretcher or other awkward loads. Seating {{can be arranged}} for one pilot and five passengers, or two pilots and three passengers. There is a door {{on both sides of}} the cabin, and there is a baggage compartment behind the rear seats. The tailplane has twin fins at the ends of the dihedral stabiliser. The elevators and rudders are fabric-covered. The tricycle landing gear is hydraulically retractable. The two engines are mounted towards the rear of the wing, driving 2-bladed fixed-pitch pusher propellers. Originally planned to use Blackburn Cirrus Major III engines, it was fitted with Walter Minor 6-III engines.|$|E
25|$|The Fairey Battle was a {{single-engine}} monoplane light bomber, {{powered by}} a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. Production aircraft were progressively powered by various models of the Merlin engine, such as the Merlin I, II, III and V. The Battle had a relatively clean design, having adopted a slim oval-shaped fuselage which was manufactured in two separate sections. The forward section, {{in front of the}} cockpit, relied mainly upon a steel tubular structure to support the weight of the nose-mounted engine; the rear section was of a metal <b>monocoque</b> <b>structure</b> comprised hoop frames and Z-section stringers which was built on jigs. The structure of the aircraft involved several innovations and firsts for Fairey, it had the distinction of being the company's first low-wing monoplane; it also was the first implementation of a light-alloy stressed-skin construction to be produced by the firm.|$|E
5000|$|In motor racing, {{the safety}} of the driver depends on the car body which must meet {{stringent}} regulations and only a few cars have been built with <b>monocoque</b> <b>structures.</b> An aluminum alloy monocoque chassis was first used in the 1962 Lotus 25 Formula 1 race car and McLaren was the first to use carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers to construct the monocoque of the 1981 McLaren MP4/1, and in 1992 the McLaren F1 became the first production car with a carbon-fiber monocoque.|$|R
50|$|Future Systems {{proposals}} adapted construction methods {{from other}} professions, including (most commonly) the curved <b>monocoque</b> shell <b>structures</b> found in aircraft design, car design and boat building.|$|R
50|$|Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev {{mentioned}} its pivotal use of composite materials.Fuselage length differs through extension plugs {{with the}} longer variant having a large aft door, and both {{share a common}} wing, nose and empennage.Also involved are RT-Khimkomposit (Chemical Composites) and TsAGI (the Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute), having tested MC-21 wing boxes.Similar out of autoclave infusion methods will reduce costs of <b>monocoque</b> <b>structures</b> over a large production run.Limited ground handling is needed and low-pressure tires enable operations from unpaved soil/ or grass runways.First Flight is planned for 2015.|$|R
25|$|The {{idea for}} a Soviet armored ground-attack {{aircraft}} dates to the early 1930s, when Dmitry Pavlovich Grigorovich designed TSh-1 and TSh-2 armored biplanes. However, Soviet engines at the time lacked the power needed to provide the heavy aircraft with good performance. Il-2 was designed by Sergey Ilyushin and his team at the Central Design Bureau in 1938. TsKB-55 was a two-seat aircraft with an armoured shell weighing 700kg (1,540lb), protecting crew, engine, radiators, and the fuel tank. Standing loaded, the Ilyushin weighed more than 4,700kg (10,300lb), making the armoured shell about 15% of the aircraft's gross weight. Uniquely for a World War II attack aircraft, and similarly to the forward fuselage design of the World War I-era Imperial German Junkers J.I armored, all-metal biplane, the Il-2's armor {{was designed as a}} load-bearing part of the Ilyushin's <b>monocoque</b> <b>structure,</b> thus saving considerable weight. The prototype TsKB-55, which first flew on 2 October 1939, won the government competition against the Sukhoi Su-6 and received VVS designation BSh-2. The prototypes – TsKB-55 and TskB-57 – were built at Moscow plant #39, at that time the Ilyushin design bureau's base.|$|E
500|$|Like {{all of its}} Formula One contemporaries, the BT49 chassis is a <b>monocoque</b> <b>structure.</b> It {{is built}} from sheet {{aluminium}} alloy with reinforcement from carbon fibre composite panels {{and is one of}} the first Formula One chassis to incorporate this material structurally. The chassis is slightly longer than that of the BT48, and is new from the cockpit back with revised sidepods and a structural fuel tank reduced from [...] capacity to match the reduced fuel consumption requirements of the DFV compared to the Alfa Romeo. This allowed a reduction in dry weight over the BT48 of [...] and of [...] when fully fuelled.|$|E
2500|$|Drawing {{from the}} {{experience}} of the French and their SPAD S.XIII, the desire was to make a sleeker and more maneuverable fighter. The VCP-1 was powered by a Wright-built [...] Hispano-Suiza 8 V-8 engine and had tapered single-bay biplane wings. The fuselage was a <b>monocoque</b> <b>structure</b> constructed of plywood, while the wings were of wood and fabric construction. The engine was cooled with an unusual annular radiator.|$|E
25|$|Variants {{could have}} an open cockpit (the {{prototype}} and the NA-22) or be under a glass greenhouse that covered both cockpits. On some variants, {{the rear of the}} canopy could be opened for a gunner to fire to the rear. A variety of air-cooled radial engines, including the Wright Whirlwind, Pratt & Whitney Wasp and Pratt & Whitney Wasp Junior of varying horsepowers, could be installed depending on customer preferences. The fuselage was built up from steel tubes and normally fabric covered; however, later versions were provided with aluminium <b>monocoque</b> <b>structures.</b>|$|R
25|$|Given Bowlus’s {{penchant for}} consistency, all-Duraloid {{construction}} {{is the most}} likely as there is no photographic or descriptive text indicating the wing to have been other than a fully <b>monocoque</b> cantilever <b>structure.</b>|$|R
50|$|By the World War II era many {{aircraft}} {{designs were}} using metal <b>monocoque</b> <b>structures</b> {{due to their}} higher operating airspeeds, although fabric-covered control surfaces were still used on early mark Spitfires and other types. The Hawker Hurricane had a fabric covered fuselage, and they also had fabric covered wings until 1939. Many transports, bombers and trainers still used fabric, although the flammable nitrate dope was replaced with butyrate dope instead, which burns less readily. The Mosquito {{is an example of}} a fabric-covered (Madapolam) plywood aircraft. The Vickers Wellington used fabric over a geodesic airframe which offered good combat damage resistance.|$|R
2500|$|Both Magister and M.15 were wooden aircraft, {{built with}} spruce members with ply covering. [...] The M.15 {{fuselage}} though, was a <b>monocoque</b> <b>structure,</b> much more rounded in cross-section (more {{visible in the}} lower half of the fuselage) than the flat-sided and flat-bottomed Magister. The wings were built around two spruce spars with plywood webs and ribs of spruce and ply, the whole structure plywood-covered and, like the fuselage, sheathed in fabric. The unladened M.15 was over 40% heavier than the Magister.|$|E
2500|$|The Type 146 was a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with tapering {{wings of}} moderate dihedral {{on the outer}} sections. The wings were stress skinned with aluminium with only the ailerons and tail control surfaces fabric-covered. The two sets of four [...] Browning machine guns were housed in the outer wing sections. The undercarriage was mounted about halfway along the centre section and retracted cleanly inwards into the wing; the tailwheel was also fully retractable. In contrast to the Type 133, the fuselage was a <b>monocoque</b> <b>structure.</b> The cockpit was enclosed with a one-piece sliding canopy.|$|E
2500|$|The front {{fuselage}} {{was built}} on four tubular longerons, but from leading edge rearwards it consisted {{of a set of}} oval formers with stringers. [...] The greatest novelty of the P.10 was that this part of the fuselage was not only a <b>monocoque</b> <b>structure</b> (still fairly unusual at the time), but a monocoque of steel with a load-bearing plastic skin riveted between the formers and stringers. [...] Specifically, the plastic was Bakelite-Dilecto, a hard, synthetic cellulose-formaldehyde product. [...] The company claimed it was proof against fire, heat, humidity and insects. [...] This was the first use of structural plastic in an airframe and perhaps the last for another sixty years.|$|E
50|$|It uses a <b>monocoque</b> (unibody) <b>structure,</b> {{in common}} with almost all other {{crossovers}} in its class, but unlike traditional SUVs built with body-on-frame designs. The Freelander {{was replaced by the}} Discovery Sport in 2015.|$|R
50|$|Typical uses of {{composites}} are <b>monocoque</b> <b>structures</b> for aerospace and automobiles, {{as well as}} {{more mundane}} products like fishing rods and bicycles. The stealth bomber was the first all-composite aircraft, but many passenger aircraft like the Airbus and the Boeing 787 use an increasing proportion of composites in their fuselages, such as hydrophobic melamine foam. The quite different physical properties of composites gives designers a much greater freedom in shaping parts, which is why composite products often look different to conventional products. On the other hand, some products such as drive shafts, helicopter rotor blades, and propellers look identical to metal precursors owing to the basic functional needs of such components.|$|R
50|$|The McLaren F1 was {{the first}} {{production}} road car to use a complete carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) <b>monocoque</b> chassis <b>structure.</b> Aluminium and magnesium were used for attachment points for the suspension system, inserted directly into the CFRP.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, in 1979 Kaplický {{set up his}} own {{architectural}} think tank called Future Systems with David Nixon, and began to develop an architectural style that combined organic forms with high tech futurism. Among the drawings he made were structures orbiting the earth built by robots, weekend houses resembling survival capsules that could be transported by helicopter, and home interiors that could be manipulated. In the 1980s his design for the Grand Buildings in Trafalgar Square, London, was a free-form <b>monocoque</b> <b>structure</b> pierced by portholes; it lost to a more conventional reconstruction of an Edwardian facade. Kaplický told BusinessWeek in 2005: [...] "Where is it written that buildings have to be boxes? People aren't boxes." ...|$|E
2500|$|The D.I had a {{semi-monocoque}} plywood fuselage, {{consisting of}} a single-layered outer shell, supported by a minimal internal structure. This was lighter and stronger than the fabric-skinned box-type fuselage then in common use, as well being easier to give an aerodynamically clean shape. At the same time its panelled-plywood skinning, done with mostly four-sided panels of thin plywood over the entire minimal fuselage structure, was less labour-intensive (and therefore less costly to manufacture) than a [...] "true" [...] <b>monocoque</b> <b>structure.</b> The Albatros D.I was powered by either a [...] Benz Bz.III or a [...] Mercedes D.III six-cylinder water cooled inline engine. The additional power of the Mercedes (Daimler) engine enabled twin fixed Spandau machine-guns to be fitted without any loss in performance.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was an alloy-skinned <b>monocoque</b> <b>structure</b> of polygonal section, and the thicker {{plates of}} the wings were also stressed, taking the drag loads. The wings carried 90° flaps {{and there was}} a wide track, inward-retracting main undercarriage plus a small fixed tailwheel. Both the flaps and undercarriage were electrically operated. [...] The deep RAF 34 wing section eased the installation of the required eight Browning machine guns. [...] The Venom was powered by a [...] Bristol Aquila AE-3S sleeve valve radial engine, hinge-mounted so it could be swung sideways for easy maintenance. [...] The Aquila drove a three-bladed propeller. Joseph [...] "Mutt" [...] Summers flew the Venom on her first flight, 17 June 1936. [...] Unlike the Hurricane and Spitfire, the Venom was fitted with full armament from its first flight.|$|E
50|$|The EX1 {{features}} stylistic {{design codes}} first presented on the SR1 concept in earlier 2010. The <b>monocoque</b> body <b>structure</b> is manufactured from a carbon/honeycomb composite to optimise weight and rigidity. The car is 0.90 metres high and 1.77 metres wide.|$|R
50|$|The LFU 205 {{is a single}}-engined, low-winged {{monoplane}} {{of conventional}} appearance apart from slight, 7° forward sweep on the moderately tapered wing. This carries Fowler flaps along the whole trailing edge inboard of the Frise ailerons. The tail surfaces are also straight tapered, with the vertical surfaces slightly swept. The tailplane is a single piece, all moving surface. There are two pairs of side by side seats under a large curved, rearward sliding, canopy. Fuselage and flying surfaces are <b>monocoque</b> <b>structures</b> using a grp sandwich with a smooth outer surface bonded to a corrugated inner skin, the latter formed from parallel 10 mm (0.4 in) tubes wrapped in glass fibre. The corrugations run chordwise, rib-like, in the wings and tail and circumferentially in the fuselage. The tail structures have a foam plastic core.|$|R
40|$|This report gives a {{comparison}} of the accuracy of the three methods for calculating the compressive strength of flat sheet and stiffener combinations such as occur in stressed-skin or <b>monocoque</b> <b>structures</b> for aircraft. Of the three methods based upon various assumptions with regard to the interaction of sheet and stiffener, the method based upon mutual action of the stiffener and an effective width as a column gave the best agreement with the results of the tests. An investigation of the effect of small curvature resulted in the conclusion that the compressive strength of the curved panels is, for all practical purposes, equal to the strength of flat panels except for thick sheet where non-uniform curvature throughout the length may cause the strength of the curved panel to be 10 to 15 percent less than that of a corresponding flat panel...|$|R
2500|$|The Hawker Fury was an {{evolutionary}} {{successor to the}} successful Hawker Typhoon and Tempest fighters and fighter-bombers of the Second World War. The Fury's design process was initiated in September 1942 by Sydney Camm, one of Hawker's foremost aircraft designers, to meet the Royal Air Force’s requirement for a lightweight Tempest Mk.II replacement; the Tempest, while a successful aircraft, had been viewed as being heavy and oversized for typical fighter duties. Developed as the [...] "Tempest Light Fighter", the semi-elliptical wing of the Tempest was incorporated, but was shortened in span by attaching the two wings at the aircraft centreline, eliminating the centre-section. The fuselage itself was broadly similar in form {{to that of the}} Tempest, but was a fully <b>monocoque</b> <b>structure,</b> while the cockpit level was higher, affording the pilot better all round visibility.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was a <b>monocoque</b> <b>structure</b> of longerons and hoops, {{covered in}} three-ply. [...] The fuselage was flat sided but deep and carefully made {{upper and lower}} fairings produced its overall rounded look. The high quality and lightness of the woodworking was remarked upon; Pandar had built his reputation and fortune in the furniture trade. [...] As on the earlier versions of the Carley C.12 the cockpit was between the wing spars, faired by a coaming with a circular cutout. The fixed, conventional undercarriage was also {{similar to that of}} the C.12, with steel V-form struts hinged on the upper longerons supporting, via rubber shock absorbers, the landing wheels and outer ends of split axles, hinged to the central fuselage underside. The inverted Y-Anzani had a smooth, rounded cowling through which much of its cylinders protruded. [...] It drove a two-bladed propeller.|$|E
2500|$|The Cockle [...] was an {{all-metal}} aircraft {{apart from}} the fabric-covered flying surfaces. [...] The hull was a duralumin <b>monocoque</b> <b>structure</b> with a concave V-shaped planing bottom incorporating two steps, the main one near the centre of gravity. [...] These steps were external to the monocoque to prevent step damage leading to water leakage into the hull. [...] The top of the hull was rounded, with a single-seat open cockpit near the nose. [...] The wings had steel spars and were mounted {{on the top of}} the fuselage, with pairs of bracing struts to the chines. [...] The wings carried full-span ailerons which could be drooped together, flap-like, for landing. There were stabilising floats near the wingtips in trouser-like fairings. [...] The two engines were mounted on top of the wing at about mid-chord, the twin-bladed propellers being driven via long extension shafts to the leading edge. [...] Originally the Cockle had a shallow triangular fin and rudder, but this was later extended upwards to a curved and slightly pointed profile which more than doubled the area, to cope better with single-engine flying. A tube ran transversely across the hull just above the main step, into which the axle of a pair of ground-handling wheels could be inserted.|$|E
5000|$|The first vehicle {{built by}} the {{automotive}} division of Fuji Heavy Industries was called the Subaru 1500, with the development code-name of P1. The prototype used a <b>monocoque</b> body <b>structure</b> and adopting the [...] "ponton" [...] style appearance, with an independent front wishbone suspension and a rear leaf spring suspension with three plates and a live rear axle.|$|R
