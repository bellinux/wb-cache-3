5|$|The {{species is}} usually found in {{eucalyptus}} woodlands, or along water courses. In the more northerly {{parts of the}} country, these cockatoos are commonly seen in large flocks. They are seed eaters and cavity nesters, and as such depend on trees with fairly large diameters, generally Eucalyptus. Populations in southeastern Australia are threatened by deforestation and other habitat alterations. Of the black cockatoos, the red-tailed is the most adaptable to aviculture, although black cockatoos are much rarer and <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> in aviculture outside Australia.|$|E
5|$|Still {{photographs}} of Oheka Castle in Huntington, New York, {{were used in}} the opening montage, representing Kane's Xanadu estate. Ferguson also designed statues from Kane's collection with styles ranging from Greek to German Gothic. The sets were also built to accommodate Toland's camera movements. Walls were built to fold and furniture could quickly be moved. The film's famous ceilings were made out of muslin fabric and camera boxes were built into the floors for low angle shots. Welles later said that he was proud that the film production value looked <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than the film's budget. Although neither worked with Welles again, Toland and Ferguson collaborated in several films in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|The {{battleship}} race soon accelerated once more, {{placing a}} great {{burden on the}} finances of the governments which engaged in it. The first dreadnoughts were not <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than the last pre-dreadnoughts, but the cost per ship continued to grow thereafter. Modern battleships were the crucial element of naval power {{in spite of their}} price. Each battleship was a signal of national power and prestige, {{in a manner similar to}} the nuclear weapons of today. Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Japan and Austria all began dreadnought programmes, and second-rank powers including the Ottoman Empire, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{special effects}} were {{supervised}} by RKO department head Vernon L. Walker. Welles pioneered several visual effects to cheaply shoot things like crowd scenes and large interior spaces. For example, {{the scene in}} which the camera in the opera house rises dramatically to the rafters, to show the workmen showing a lack of appreciation for Susan Alexander Kane's performance, was shot by a camera craning upwards over the performance scene, then a curtain wipe to a miniature of the upper regions of the house, and then another curtain wipe matching it again with {{the scene of the}} workmen. Other scenes effectively employed miniatures to make the film look <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than it truly was, such as various shots of Xanadu.|$|E
5|$|Land {{transport}} remained <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than {{river or}} sea transport during the period. Many towns in this period, including York, Exeter and Lincoln, {{were linked to}} the oceans by navigable rivers and could act as seaports, with Bristol's port coming to dominate the lucrative trade in wine with Gascony by the 13th century, but shipbuilding generally remained on a modest scale and economically unimportant to England at this time. Transport remained very costly {{in comparison to the}} overall price of products. By the 13th century, groups of common carriers ran carting businesses, and carting brokers existed in London to link traders and carters. These used the four major land routes crossing England: Ermine Street, the Fosse Way, Icknield Street and Watling Street. A large number of bridges were built during the 12th century to improve the trade network.|$|E
5|$|MD32 was reconstructed and widened from Sykesville to Eldersburg {{starting}} in 1957 and from West Friendship to {{just south of}} Sykesville in 1958. The state highway's bypass of Sykesville was completed in 1963; the old road {{through the center of}} Sykesville became MD851. MD32's new bridge across the Patapsco River was the longest of only three aluminum triangular box beam girder bridges constructed in the United States. The girder system was topped by a concrete slab deck and underlain with standard concrete abutments and piers and steel bearing pads on which the aluminum girders rested. These bridges, which were designed by Fairchild Engine and Airplane Company, were constructed of aluminum due to that metal's light weight but similar strength compared to steel. Many experimental aluminum bridges were built due to a severe shortage of steel in the early 1960s. Aluminum bridges are rarely constructed because they are <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than steel and concrete bridges.|$|E

5|$|The company DuPont {{and many}} {{industrial}} historians dispute {{a link between}} nylon and hemp. They argue {{that the reason for}} developing nylon was to produce a fiber that could compete with silk and rayon in, for example, thin stockings for women. Silk was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than hemp and imported largely from Japan. There was more money in a substitute for silk. DuPont focused early on thin stockings for women. As a commercial product, nylon was a revolution in textiles. Strong and water-resistant, it was possible to make very thin fibers from cheap raw materials. The first sales in 1938 in New York of nylon stockings created a line with 4000 middle class women. For years to come, nylon demand was greater than DuPont could produce. And the DuPont Group was very big; it could move on if nylon had not become a success.|$|E
5|$|Xenon is {{obtained}} commercially as {{a by-product of}} the separation of air into oxygen and nitrogen. After this separation, generally performed by fractional distillation in a double-column plant, the liquid oxygen produced will contain small quantities of krypton and xenon. By additional fractional distillation, the liquid oxygen may be enriched to contain 0.1–0.2% of a krypton/xenon mixture, which is extracted either by absorption onto silica gel or by distillation. Finally, the krypton/xenon mixture may be separated into krypton and xenon by further distillation. Worldwide production of xenon in 1998 was estimated at 5,000–7,000m3. Because of its scarcity, xenon is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than the lighter noble gases—approximate prices for the purchase of small quantities in Europe in 1999 were 10€/L for xenon, 1€/L for krypton, and 0.20€/L for neon, while the much more plentiful argon costs less than a cent per liter.|$|E
5|$|Especially {{important}} was the fishing and trade in herring and cod in the Atlantic and the Baltic Sea. The herring was of unprecedented significance to the economy of much of Northern Europe, {{and it was one}} of the most common commodities traded by the Hanseatic League, a powerful north German alliance of trading guilds. Kippers made from herring caught in the North Sea could be found in markets as far away as Constantinople. While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh, a large proportion was salted, dried, and, to a lesser extent, smoked. Stockfish, cod that was split down the middle, fixed to a pole and dried, was very common, though preparation could be time-consuming, and meant beating the dried fish with a mallet before soaking it in water. A wide range of mollusks including oysters, mussels and scallops were eaten by coastal and river-dwelling populations, and freshwater crayfish were seen as a desirable alternative to meat during fish days. Compared to meat, fish was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> for inland populations, especially in Central Europe, and therefore not an option for most. Freshwater fish such as pike, carp, bream, perch, lamprey and trout were common.|$|E

50|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} based {{methods are}} typically <b>much</b> <b>more</b> computationally <b>expensive,</b> {{and not necessarily}} more accurate, ways to predict pKa values than approaches based on the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Limited conformational flexibility can also be realized within a continuum electrostatics approach, e.g., for considering multiple amino acid sidechain rotamers. In addition, current commonly used molecular force fields do not take electronic polarizability into account, which could be an important property in determining protonation energies.|$|R

40|$|The {{method of}} wavefield {{extrapolation}} by nonstationary phase shift is {{extended to the}} case of data recorded on a topographic surface. Using the NSPS (nonstationary phase shift) algorithm, the space-domain input data is phase shifted to a horizontal datum beneath the lowest topographic point. The nonstationary phase shift simultaneously accounts for lateral velocity variations and the lateral variation of downward step size. The f-k spectrum of the downward continued data is synthesized at the datum. A <b>much</b> <b>more</b> computationally <b>expensive</b> pseudo-inverse technique is also formulated for comparison. Tests on simple synthetics show that the NSPS method works nearly as well as the pseudo-inverse technique...|$|R
