5|$|Your Honor, {{years ago}} I {{recognized}} my kinship with all living beings, and I <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> mind that I {{was not one}} bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that {{while there is a}} lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.|$|E
25|$|Inevitably, I <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> mind to {{read the}} scripts of a foreign country. Around that time I went to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed myself on the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I {{was at the time}} {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were there that I would read them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I simply wanted to hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.|$|E
500|$|It {{was in my}} heart, {{there was}} no escape for me. [...] I could not have conquered it had my life been at stake. [...] There were {{thousands}} of people in town on Tuesday. [...] I heard it was President's Day. [...] All those people seemed bowing to the great ruler. [...] I <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> mind to kill that ruler.|$|E

50|$|Disc 4 and 5 are the {{sessions}} that <b>made</b> <b>up</b> the <b>My</b> Funny Valentine and Four & More albums, both recorded in 1964 at the Lincoln Center, New York, on February 12, 1964.|$|R
5000|$|... 2010 saw {{the release}} of 'Selected', a {{selection}} of Recoil tracks chosen by Alan who explains: [...] "The collection is <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of <b>my</b> personal favourites, remastered and edited together into what I consider a cohesive and total listening experience.” ...|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} with newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane, Tesla {{said that he did}} not believe in telepathy, stating, [...] "Suppose I <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> mind to murder you," [...] he said, [...] "In a second you would know it. Now, isn't that wonderful? By what process does the mind get at all this?" [...] In the same interview, Tesla said that he believed that all fundamental laws could be reduced to one.|$|E
500|$|In 1958, Kneale's play Mrs Wickens in the Fall, {{transmitted}} by the BBC the previous year, was remade by the CBS {{network in the}} United States, retitled The Littlest Enemy. Broadcast on 18 June as part of The United States Steel Hour anthology series, the script was severely cut back in length. It was Kneale's only involvement with American television, {{and he was not}} pleased with the result. [...] "I <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> mind I would never ever again have anything done on a television network in America," [...] he later commented.|$|E
500|$|Fossett {{said he did}} not {{participate}} in any of the [...] "interesting things" [...] he had done in college during his time in exchange-related activities: [...] "There was a period of time where I wasn't doing anything except working for a living. I became very frustrated with that and finally <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> mind to start getting back into things." [...] He began to take six weeks a year off to spend time on sports and moved to Beaver Creek, Colorado in 1990. Fossett later sold most of his business interests, although he maintained an office in Chicago until 2006.|$|E

60|$|I was numbed by {{this letter}} of my father's. With almost agonised effort I strove to recall him, but I {{knew that my}} image of a tall, handsome, dark man with pale grey eyes was <b>made</b> <b>up</b> from <b>my</b> mother's few words, and from a {{portrait}} I had once seen.|$|R

500|$|Reviewers {{also took}} the {{opportunity}} to mock the franchise itself, with Eurogamer suggesting that the series be made into a sitcom. Regarding the multiplayer, IGN's Greg Miller said, [...] "This mode was so boring I <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> own story. I was the Mommy Predator and Ryan from the IGN News Team was the Daddy Predator. We were protecting our children -- the cars in the large empty lot we were running around -- from the aliens." [...] 1UP.com's Patrick Klepek said, [...] "Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem fails to capitalize on its gaming heritage, instead falling prey to the same substandard licensed schlock we're used to from the films." ...|$|E
500|$|On 15 June 1910, Bogdan Žerajić {{attempted}} {{to kill the}} iron-fisted Governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, General Marijan Varešanin. Žerajić was a 22-year-old Orthodox Serb from Nevesinje, Herzegovina, who {{was a student at}} the Faculty of Law at the University of Zagreb and made frequent trips to Belgrade. (General Verešanin went on to crush the last Bosnian peasant uprising {{in the second half of}} 1910.) The five bullets Žerajić fired at Varešanin and the fatal bullet he put in his own brain made Žerajić an inspiration to future assassins, including Princip and Princip's accomplice Čabrinović. Princip said that Žerajić [...] "was my first model. When I was seventeen I passed whole nights at his grave, reflecting on our wretched condition and thinking of him. It is there that I <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> mind sooner or later to perpetrate an outrage." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul Brown, {{the coach}} of the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), met Humble while vacationing in Florida in 1946. Brown came to watch the Orange Bowl on New Year's Day, and was staying in the same hotel as the Rice team. He saw Humble and his wife Lorraine, whom Humble had met while in {{training}} at Southwestern, on a dance floor at the hotel. [...] "He appeared to be the sort of fellow we like to have on our team," [...] Brown said later in 1947. [...] "Then I watched him in that Tennessee game and after that <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> mind he'd be with my club if I ever had the chance to make a deal for him." [...] The AAFC's Baltimore Colts selected Humble in the league's draft, but Brown got his chance in August. He engineered a trade that sent four players including quarterback Steve Nemeth and guard George Cheroke to the Colts, plus two players to be named later.|$|E
6000|$|With guilty {{conscience}} I {{watched him}} start {{off for the}} dock alone, but this sentiment on my part was wasted. A score of [...] "comrades" [...] on the boat more than <b>made</b> <b>up</b> for <b>my</b> absence, and at sunset he returned beaming, triumphant, perfectly satisfied with his day's sail. [...] "Now, I'm ready to go home," [...] he announced.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you {{can easily}} think that that <b>made</b> me prick <b>up</b> <b>my</b> ears, for the {{business}} has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred {{would have been very}} handy.|$|R
6000|$|Featherstone {{looked at}} him as if he thought he had been blunter than was necessary, but replied: [...] "Well, I suppose that's true, but I have no doubt Mrs. Featherstone has <b>made</b> <b>up</b> for <b>my</b> absence, and since you have come, we would like to talk to you about Lawrence. I dare say you will give us a few minutes." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{severity}} of the destructive acts by Union troops was significantly greater in South Carolina than in Georgia or North Carolina. This {{appears to have been}} a consequence of the animosity among both Union soldiers and officers to the state that they regarded as the [...] "cockpit of secession". One of the most serious accusations against Sherman was that he allowed his troops to burn the city of Columbia. In 1867, Gen. O. O. Howard, commander of Sherman's 15th Corps, reportedly said, [...] "It is useless to deny that our troops burnt Columbia, for I saw them in the act." [...] However, Sherman himself stated that [...] "f I had <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> mind to burn Columbia I would have burnt it with no more feeling than I would a common prairie dog village; but I did not do it ..." [...] Sherman's official report on the burning placed the blame on Confederate Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton III, who Sherman said had ordered the burning of cotton in the streets. In his memoirs, Sherman said, [...] "In my official report of this conflagration I distinctly charged it to General Wade Hampton, and confess I did so pointedly to shake the faith of his people in him, for he was in my opinion a braggart and professed to be the special champion of South Carolina." [...] Historian James M. McPherson has concluded that: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} the difficulties, Shankly felt {{immediately}} at home in his new club and he believed that he shared an immediate bond with the supporters, the Liverpool history site saying they [...] "were his kind of people". He quickly established working relationships with the coaching staff of Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Reuben Bennett who shared his views about loyalty {{to each other and}} to the club. Paisley's influence at Liverpool was [...] "crucial" [...] for, as Kelly puts it, Shankly was [...] "the great motivating force behind Liverpool, but it was Paisley who was the tactician". One aspect of the quartet's legacy to football was the conversion of an old storage room into what became known as the [...] "Boot Room", which was used for tactical discussion while cleaning and repairing boots. Although Shankly believed he had an excellent coaching staff, the playing staff were not so impressive – indeed, Shankly said of the latter: [...] "After only one match I knew that the team as a whole was not good enough. I <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> mind that we needed strengthening through the middle, a goalkeeper and a centre half who between them could stop goals, and somebody up front to create goals and score them". To deal with what he saw as a below average playing squad, 24 players were placed on the transfer list and all [...] had left the club within one year.|$|E
500|$|While {{media reports}} {{initially}} suggested that Abhishek Bachchan was being considered {{to portray the}} role of Vijay Chauhan, director Karan Malhotra approached Hrithik Roshan for the role. Roshan, however was sceptical on taking up a role earlier played by Amitabh Bachchan and agreed to star in the film only after months of deliberation. He said, [...] "The script had so much passion that I felt very emotional and I <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> mind to do it". [...] On casting Hrithik, Malhotra explained, [...] "Hrithik has the charm of a boy and the attitude of a man. Also, he has a certain vulnerability, which I was looking in my characterisation of Vijay Dinananth Chauhan." [...] While explaining the character of Vijay Chauhan, Malhotra added, [...] "Nobody can play Vijay the way Amitabh Bachchan did, and I would have wanted my Vijay to be subtle even if it wasn't Hrithik. I wanted the negative characters in my film to be bigger. This made Hrithik's victory seem bigger." [...] In preparation for the film, Roshan {{did not look up}} Bachchan's performance in the original for inspiration, as he considered his role to be completely different. Roshan, however, faced several difficulties while filming. He suffered from a severe back injury, which caused him considerable pain, throughout the shooting schedule. In an interview with Filmfare he quoted, [...] "Agneepath is the hardest I’ve ever worked in my life. I didn’t know what the film had in store for me. I’ve never been so tired in my life. I have exhausted my body completely." ...|$|E

60|$|My {{mind was}} at once <b>made</b> <b>up.</b> Dropping <b>my</b> staff, and tearing open the package of things we had brought from the ship, I {{unrolled}} the cotton cloth, and holding it in one hand, plucked with the other a twig from the bushes beside me, and telling Toby to follow my example, I broke through the covert and advanced, waving the branch in token of peace towards the shrinking forms before me.|$|R
500|$|Linda Eastman was a music fan {{who once}} commented, [...] "all my teen years were spent with an {{ear to the}} radio." [...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> mind I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{regard to}} Renesmee's unique name, Meyer wrote that she [...] "couldn't call her Jennifer or Ashley. What do you name the most unique {{baby in the}} world? I looked {{through a lot of}} baby name websites. Eventually I {{realized}} that there was no human name that was going to work for me, so I surrendered to necessity and <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> own." ...|$|E
2500|$|About {{this same}} time White wrote to Stieglitz [...] "I have <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> mind that art in {{photography}} {{will be my}} life work and am prepared to live a very simple life with my little family to carry this out." [...] His words were very prophetic since he struggled financially all of his life; {{he was known as}} a poor businessman and a great photographer.|$|E

'You {{would indeed}} have been cheated, my dear,' says he, 'but {{you would not}} have been undone, for #15,000 would have {{maintained}} us both very handsomely in this country; and I assure you,' added he, 'I had resolved to have dedicated every groat of it to you; I would not have wronged you of a shilling, and the rest I would have <b>made</b> <b>up</b> in <b>my</b> affection to you, and tenderness of you, as long as I lived.' ...|$|R
60|$|After breakfast we {{unpacked}} {{the bundle}} {{in which our}} leader had brought his climbing accessories. From it he took a coil of the strongest and lightest rope, {{a hundred and fifty}} feet in length, with climbing irons, clamps, and other devices. Lord John was an experienced mountaineer, and Summerlee had done some rough climbing at various times, so that I was really the novice at rock-work of the party; but my strength and activity may have <b>made</b> <b>up</b> for <b>my</b> want of experience.|$|R

2500|$|Dungan {{announced}} his retirement from baseball in January 1906 at age 39. Dungan later recalled: [...] "I was fed up on baseball although I had {{one of my best}} years in 1905. I <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> mind I didn't want to follow the game indefinitely, limping {{from one place to another}} as my ability declined. And I had no managerial aspirations. So I just up and quit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carrington told Woolcombe he had wavered on {{the site}} of the town after making two forays up the Waitara River, where he {{discovered}} beautiful country. [...] "I once had <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> mind to have the town there," [...] he wrote, [...] "but the almost constant surf upon the bar has caused me to prefer this place ... the New Plymouth Company has the garden of this country; all we want is labour and particularly working oxen." ...|$|E
2500|$|An anti-imperialist writer, Orwell {{promotes}} the idea that, through imperialism, both conqueror and conquered are destroyed. Orwell clearly states his displeasure with colonial Britain: [...] "I had already <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> mind that imperialism was an evil thing... I {{was all for}} the Burmese and all against their oppressors, the British." [...] The narrator perceives that the conqueror is not in control, but it is rather {{the will of the}} people that governs his actions. As ruler, he notes that it is his duty to appear resolute, with his word being final.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well answered, young thane. You have twice done me loyal service, and I {{at least}} {{do not forget}} my promises.

60|$|It was a {{fortnight}} before I was {{well enough to}} get out of bed and lie comfortably on the sofa. All that time Jack and Elsie tended me with unsparing devotion. Elsie had a little bed <b>made</b> <b>up</b> in <b>my</b> room; and Jack came to see me two or three times a day, and sat for whole hours with me. It was so nice he was a doctor! A doctor, you know, isn't a man--in some ways. And it soothed me so to have him sitting there with Elsie by my bedside.|$|R
