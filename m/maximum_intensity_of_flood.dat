40|$|Flash-flood {{disasters}} {{are very}} {{rare in the}} Transylvanian Depression. In the last decades just three events were signalled {{in the study area}}, all of them during the last 10 years. The flash floods occurring in the study area during the last decade {{had a significant impact on}} several localities situated at the Transylvanian Depression border. Based on the post flash-flood investigation, the present study intends to find out the main characteristics <b>of</b> the flash <b>floods</b> and the causes that have led to disasters in a region rarely affected by such kinds of events. Analyzing the hydrological data, it has been seen that the <b>maximum</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> the flash <b>floods</b> was observed in the upper and middle basins. By comparing the unit peak discharges from the studied region with other specific peak discharges related to the significant flash floods from Romania, it was noticed that the events from the Transylvanian Depression have moderate to low intensity. On the other hand, the results showed that besides high stream power and unexpected character common to flash floods, the inappropriate flood risk management measures increased the dimension of the negative effects, leading to tens of lives lost and economical damages of tens of millions of dollars...|$|R
