5000|$|<b>Market</b> <b>Umbrella</b> is {{a nonprofit}} {{organization}} that developed the Sticky Economic Evaluation Device (SEED), a tool that measures the economic impact of a public market on neighboring businesses. SEED multiplies the annual revenue generated by consumers of the market and abutting businesses by the multiplier. Specifically, the Regional Input-Output Modeling System II multiplier is used, which is generated by the BEA (BEA). The RIMS II multiplier measures how many dollars remain in the regional or local economy. [...] "The greater the interaction each dollar has with the local economy, the larger the multiplier." [...] This methodology also gathers information through customer-intercept surveys and head count tabulation in order to calculate the economic impact the market has on its region. <b>Market</b> <b>Umbrella</b> provides markets with access to their survey templates and facilitates report generating through the use of online accounts on their website. The sales tax revenue generated by market consumers, including purchases at neighboring businesses, is additionally captured. The SEED methodology, developed with farmers' markets in mind, has been used to measure the economic impact of Crescent City Farmers' Markets.|$|E

40|$|This {{theoretical}} chapter {{discusses the}} role that intermediaries may play in direct distribution, supply chains and supply networks. The first approach does not recognize benefits from striving for collaboration and avoids intermediaries’ participation as much as possible. Conversely, the latter two emphasize the creation of economic and efficiency values, through the alignment of goals and resources directed by a stronger channel lead body. However, {{in the case of}} micro-producers, increasing these values is not the only motivation; lifestyle or esteem factors may be, for example, more potent drivers. The research extends multi-actor supply arrangements beyond chains and networks, by introducing the concept of supply communities. This is illustrated through a vignette of a regional food <b>marketing</b> <b>umbrella</b> group that plays an organizing role. Findings suggest intermediaries to act as triggers for collaboration. The complementary nature of the community approach suggests a framework for micro-businesses to strengthen their operations with existing traditional supply arrangements...|$|R

40|$|Corporate {{action is}} subject to more {{scrutiny}} than ever. An attempt to legitimize the corporate role is seen in corporate social responsibility {{as a part of}} a triple bottom line framework. Corporate principles are communicated in various forms to a wide set of stakeholders. Ideally, what is communicated in terms of principles is also seen in business practice. In cases where the principles and actions differ, the platform for creating a brand territory is limited. The communication platform is affected by, for example, corporate documents, actions and media perceptions. The studied cases, from the construction industry, illustrate how media portrays business conduct. It shows that the corporate communication strategy is affected by media’s verdicts. Driven by outside pressure, a set of ethical principles were declared but they received little attention since their press release was poorly timed; the press release coincided with a scandal of unethical business conduct concerning the same company. Branding represents a cornerstone in the corporate <b>marketing</b> <b>umbrella.</b> It is a simplifying symbol that helps stakeholders distinguish between sales offers. Credence values such as social responsibility and ethical business conduct are intangible; the brand thus becomes a guarantee for the communicated social values...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{the cloud}} {{computing}} paradigm has been receiving significant excitement and {{attention in the}} media and blogosphere. To some, cloud computing seems to be little more than a <b>marketing</b> <b>umbrella,</b> encompassing topics such as distributed computing, grid computing, utility computing, and softwareas-a-service, that have already received significant research focus and commercial implementation. Nonetheless, there exist an increasing number of large companies that are offering cloud computing infrastructure products and services that do not entirely resemble the visions of these individual component topics. In this article we discuss the limitations and opportunities of deploying data management issues on these emerging cloud computing platforms (e. g., Amazon Web Services). We speculate that large scale data analysis tasks, decision support systems, and application specific data marts are more likely to take advantage of cloud computing platforms than operational, transactional database systems (at least initially). We present a list of features that a DBMS designed for large scale data analysis tasks running on an Amazon-style offering should contain. We then discuss some currently available open source and commercial database options {{that can be used to}} perform such analysis tasks, and conclude that none of these options, as presently architected, match the requisite features. We thus express the need for a new DBMS, designed specifically for cloud computing environments. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore whether {{internal}} marketing could be a powerful tool for engaging employees on the corporate responsibility journey. Design/methodology/approach: In the absence of empirical work linking internal marketing efforts in organizations and employee engagement in corporate responsibility issues, a conceptual approach based on literature review is carried out to determine the existing possibilities provided by internal marketing to enhance corporate responsibility. Findings: Reflexion from the extant literature indicates that, because employee engagement matters, internal responsibility should be put first. The internal <b>marketing</b> <b>umbrella,</b> including ‘selling internally’ the idea of responsibility, facilitating internal communication, enhancing corporate volunteering or the possibility to become a social intrapreneur, could help to align employees´ needs with corporate responsibility goals. Practical implications: The results suggest that managers must ensure that internal aspects of management, such as internal communication and employee commitment are taken into account in order to get success in corporate responsibility issues. Managers need to be more proactive trying to introduce the marketing function in human capital issues. Understanding employees´ wants and needs and selling internally responsibility goals would make external efforts in developing a responsible strategy much more likely to succeed. Originality/value: Reflecting the literature which highlights the importance of internal marketing, we pay particular attention to their role on promoting corporate responsibility internally. The results indicate that while organizations strive to achieve corporate responsibility goals, it is expected that effectiveness will be greater among organizations using internal marketing tools for this purpose. To the best of our knowledge is the first time this relationship has been academically discussed offering recommendations for practitioners. </p...|$|R

30|$|From a {{consumer}} perspective, marketing strategy is significant {{to promote the}} products, particularly the brand, and introduce its new extension. From the competitor perspective, marketing strategy apparently creates competitive advantage in both the local market and global industry. Therefore, marketing strategy (encompassing branding, marketing mix, and other strategies under this <b>marketing</b> strategy <b>umbrella)</b> is a mediator between the firm that introduces a brand or a product, the consumers, and their competitors (Olson and Mitchell 2000; Stewart 1997). Consequently, marketing strategy illustrates brand reliance, in order to position themselves in a particular market and industry, and target consumers.
