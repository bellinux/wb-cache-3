50|$|Issoria baumanni, Baumann's <b>mountain</b> <b>fritillary,</b> is a {{butterfly}} in the Nymphalidae family. It {{is found in}} Nigeria, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania. The habitat consists of grassland, marshy areas and forest margins at high altitudes.|$|E
50|$|Boloria napaea, the Napaea {{fritillary}} or <b>mountain</b> <b>fritillary,</b> is {{a butterfly}} of the Nymphalidae family. In Europe {{the species is}} found in the Alps, mountainous areas in northern Scandinavia and very local in the eastern parts of the Pyrenees. In North America it is found in Alaska, northwestern Canada, and in small populations in the Canadian part of the Rocky Mountains, Alberta, and Wyoming. In Asia it is found in Siberia, the Altai Mountains, and the Amur Oblast.|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} point {{counts in}} the alpine {{zone of the}} Presidential Range of the White Mountains, New Hampshire, USA, to estimate the distribution and density of the rare endemic White <b>Mountain</b> <b>Fritillary</b> (Boloria chariclea montinus). Incidence of occurrence and density of the endemic White <b>Mountain</b> <b>Fritillary</b> during surveys in 2012 and 2013 were greatest in the herbaceous-snowbank plant community. Densities at points in the heath-shrub-rush plant community were lower, but because this plant community is more widespread in the alpine zone, it likely supports the bulk of adult fritillaries. White <b>Mountain</b> <b>Fritillary</b> used cushion-tussock, the other alpine plant community suspected of providing habitat, only sparingly. Detectability of White Mountain Fritillaries varied {{as a consequence of}} weather conditions during the survey and among observers, suggesting that raw counts yield biased estimates of density and abundance. Point counts, commonly used to study and monitor populations of birds, were an effective means of sampling White <b>Mountain</b> <b>Fritillary</b> in the alpine environment where patches of habitat are small, irregularly shaped, and widely spaced, rendering line-transect methods inefficient and difficult to implement...|$|E
