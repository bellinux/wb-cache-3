5|$|The third era {{deviates}} {{from the}} original plot considerably. When Lara was young she travelled with her parents on many of their archaeological expeditions which helped to shape the woman she was becoming. It was {{on one of these}} expeditions that her mother vanished and was presumed dead and a few years later her father presumably took his own life, she was then left in the care of Conrad Roth. Even though she was left with a vast fortune, giving her the means to attend Cambridge with ease, Lara chose to study at University College London. This decision required her to pay her tuition and rent by working many jobs. Though this was a <b>much</b> <b>tougher</b> choice, it helped her become more grounded and level-headed than she might otherwise have been. She also ended up meeting her best friend, Samantha Nishimura, during her time at UCL. It was because of Sam's free spirit and wild streak that Lara was able to experience much more of London than just the universities and museums that she loved so much. After travelling the world, both Lara and Sam end up on an expedition to the Dragon's Triangle off the Japanese coast in search of the lost civilisation of Yamatai. It is on this expedition that Lara is stranded on a remote island full of natural, human and supernatural dangers, which enables her to develop from a vulnerable girl to a survivor. And after experiencing the supernatural powers of the ancient world, she comes to realise her father was right about his theories and her hunger for adventure awakens.|$|E

Put simply, Canberra wanted strategic assurances that the United States would come to her aid in the next time of troubles; Washington wanted cooperation, an opportunity to take advantage of the island continent&# 039;s unique geographical position in the Western Pacific, as well as the overall political positioning Southeast Asia. Neither got exactly what it wanted. Nonetheless, for more than fifty years, the ANZUS Alliance has been at the heart of Australia&# 039;s foreign and defence policy.

After the garrison repelled two French assaults, a relief army of Joaquín Blake y Joyes appeared and the two sides clashed in the Battle of Saguntum on 25 October.

Hewing a path through their opponents, the armor-clad heavy cavalrymen captured a Spanish artillery battery before their impetus was spent. When Suchet ordered the 24th Dragoons to attack, the rout of Blake's army became general.

25|$|Railtrack was {{severely}} criticised for both its performance {{in improving the}} railway infrastructure and for its safety record. Between its creation and late 1998, the company had a relatively calm relationship with its first economic regulator, John Swift QC, whose strategy was to encourage Railtrack to make commitments to improvement. But critics said that the regulator was not tough enough and that the company had, as a result, been able to abuse its monopoly position. In particular, its customers, the passenger and freight train operators, were desperate for regulatory action to force the company to improve its stewardship of the network and its performance. Swift had been appointed rail regulator in 1993 by the then Conservative transport secretary John MacGregor MP. When the Labour government took over after the general election in May 1997, the new transport secretary (and deputy prime minister) John Prescott took a much harder line. When Swift's five-year term of office expired on 30 November 1998, he was not reappointed. After an interim holding period, during which Chris Bolt, Swift's chief economic adviser and effective deputy, filled the regulator's position, in July 1999 a new rail regulator began a five-year term, and a new, <b>much</b> <b>tougher</b> regulatory era began.|$|E

The 28th seeded German proved a <b>much</b> <b>tougher</b> prospect and after Murray failed to see out the match from a commanding position in the fourth set, play was abandoned due to bad light at 7–7 in the deciding fifth set. Despite having never been beyond 7–5 in a decider, Murray held his nerve to take it 12–10 when play resumed the following day. He then returned the next day to take on Fernando Verdasco, but this match proved less troublesome with Murray picking up the win in straight sets. In the quarter-finals, Murray played childhood friend Gaël Monfils and stormed into a two set lead. Monfils hit back though, winning the next two to take it to a decider. Despite the momentum seeming to be against Murray, he turned the match round spectacularly to take the final set 6–0 and reach the semi-finals, equalling his best ever result at the French Open. The result saw him become only the 10th man to reach multiple semi-finals at all four Grand Slams and also reach a British-record 14th Grand Slam semi-final. In the semi-finals he faced Rafael Nadal for the second consecutive tournament. Nadal was at his best throughout the match and Murray struggled to keep up, weakened by the two long, five-set matches he had already played. In the end, Nadal saw off Murray in under two hours, winning comfortably in straight sets.|$|E
