40|$|The study {{investigated}} South African <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement {{and the possible}} influences of {{various factors such as}} demographic characteristics, expenditure on clothing, the frequency of clothing purchases, store patronage and <b>men</b> <b>s</b> work dress code. A survey was conducted across Gauteng which is the largest retail hub in South Africa with mainly urban areas. Most consumers in Gauteng have access to different clothing retailers. Consulta Research, a professional research company assisted with data collection. Data was collected by means of convenient sampling. Online questionnaires were distributed to their data base and a total of 479 usable questionnaires were completed. Data analysis consisted of descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, ANOVA s, Chi square tests and other post hoc tests. The study confirmed that men clothing involvement is not equally strong for all four dimensions of clothing involvement that are distinguished in literature. Previous studies suggested that involvement should be studied from an age ordering perspective, and therefore respondents demographic characteristics were vital in terms of the analysis of the data. Certain demographic characteristics seemed to be good indicators of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement, namely age and marital status while factors such as work dress code surprisingly {{do not seem to be}} useful to predict <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement. The majority of the sample spent less than 5 % of their monthly household income on clothing for themselves and indicated that they purchase clothing sporadically when necessary. Findings nevertheless indicated that expenditure on their clothing and frequency of clothing purchases are useful indicators of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement. Although younger men (generation Y) were more inclined to patronise specialised <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing retailers, irrespective of their work dress code, the majority of men patronised general retailers and department stores when purchasing their clothing. Findings confirm that consumption- and purchase involvement are the prevalent forms of clothing involvement that are relevant in terms of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing behaviour. Indications are that <b>men</b> <b>s</b> advertising involvement is not particularly strong, which implies that they gain their product information and fashion information from alternative sources that rather relates to purchase involvement which tested high in most cases. This has implications for retail because <b>men</b> <b>s</b> stronger purchase involvement probably means that the physical retail environment is more important in terms of fashion information and to inspire <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing purchases. Therefore retailers should focus more on factors that make in-store decisions easier for males such as displays and placement of clothing. Male apparel is a potentially lucrative and growing market that can be even more profitable. Younger men spend more on their clothing therefore this group should therefore take preference but the older men should not be forgotten. Based on the findings of this study various recommendations are made with a large focus to either expand this study or build onto this existing research. Topics related to male clothing and involvement of clothing can definitely be built on and studied more in the apparel industry to fill a gap on knowledge that is lacking and should be explored further.

On the day of Princess <b>Man</b> <b>Sing</b> wedding to the Tibetan Emperor, Lady Gwai the Tang Emperor's favorite concubine overhears the Ching's 3rd madam Sam Kam Hing (Angelina Lo) insulting her to Ching's 2nd madam Sheung Goon Dan Fung (Gigi Wong) because Lady Gwai was once the 2nd madam's personal maid.

Seeing none of the Tibetan girls present at the ceremony being attractive, Lady Gwai suggest to the Tang Emperor that the Ching family take a Tibetan girl as their daughter-in-law to better relations with the new royal in-laws. 2nd madam Ching could not refuse the request since the Tang Emperor had agreed to Lady Gwai's suggestion.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} Indian {{middle class}} <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear {{of violence in}} public spaces. It attempts to broaden {{the perspective of the}} implications of fear of violence. Both the public and academic discourses on violence in public spaces in India are centered on the notion of the female victim. In this thesis I argue that we need to open up a strict binary understanding of only women as vulnerable and affected by the fear of crime in public spaces. I discuss the gendered implications of different types of violence, and how different identity categories that cut across gender, have an impact on middle class <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear. In addition to this I assess how the fear for others safety and the masculine ideal of being a protector has an impact on <b>men</b> <b>s</b> personal fear of violence. Because there is no research on <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear of crime in an Indian context I have supported my analyses with three theoretical frameworks, all relevant in different ways. This is the research on masculinity in India, the research on men and fear from the West, and the research on middle class women and fear of crime in India. My own research consists of data collected through a survey where 98 men and women participated, and interviews with men who are involved in initiatives for safer cities. To understand how fear of violence in public spaces is affecting lives in India, it is necessary to not restrict ourselves to only women s narratives. This thesis is an attempt at putting <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear of violence on the agenda, and hopefully it contributes to a widening of the understanding of fear of violence in public spaces...|$|R

40|$|O presente estudo tem como tem?tica central o empoderamento do homem acerca dos direitos reprodutivos. Trata-se de um estudo explorat?rio-descritivo, desenvolvido nas unidades de sa?de do Distrito Sanit?rio III no munic?pio de Jo?o Pessoa PB/Brasil. Objetivou {{investigar}} a compreens?o dos direitos reprodutivos dos homens a partir das falas dos Agentes Comunit?rios de Sa?de (ACS), bem como, identificar estrat?gias de promo??o da sa?de do homem no exerc?cio desses direitos. Os dados foram coletados por meio de entrevista realizada com 25 ACS, os quais integram a equipe de sa?de da fam?lia pertencentes ao referido local de estudo, no per?odo de junho a agosto 2012. Para a realiza??o da pesquisa foi preconizado ?s normas da Resolu??o n? 196 / 96 do Conselho Nacional de Sa?de sobre pesquisa envolvendo seres humanos e da Resolu??o n? 311 / 2007 do Conselho Federal de Enfermagem. Para a an?lise dos resultados da pesquisa optou-se pela t?cnica de an?lise de conte?do, proposta por Bardin. Os resultados alcan?ados constataram que h? d?ficits de conhecimento dos ACS acerca dos direitos reprodutivos e a participa??o do homem nas a??es que envolvem a sa?de reprodutiva, no entanto, revelam uma percep??o de mudan?a no papel do homem acerca do planejamento familiar e acompanhamento do ciclo grav?dico-puerperal. A partir destas constata??es, os ACS apontaram como estrat?gias para o empoderamento do homem na promo??o da sa?de reprodutiva: a visita domiciliar, a??es dial?gicas para a conscientiza??o, campanhas educativas, maior atua??o da Aten??o B?sica na divulga??o da Pol?tica Nacional de Aten??o Integral ? Sa?de do Homem e na constru??o de uma metodologia que favore?a a inser??o da popula??o masculina ancorada em uma pol?tica inclusiva, a partir das demandas priorit?rias, bem como a instrumentaliza??o multiprofissional para o cuidado com o homem. Desse modo, conclui-se que uma vez vencida a barreira em discutir o significado do ser masculino e feminino nas quest?es que englobam a sa?de reprodutiva, encarando-o como ser-cidad?o, o homem poder? se reconhecer como sujeito de direitos reprodutivos, atuando como co-respons?veis nas a??es da vida reprodutiva do casal. The {{study has}} as central issue {{the discussion of}} <b>man</b> <b>s</b> empowerment in relation to reproductive rights in the Health Communitarian Agents? point of view. It is an exploratory-descriptive research accomplished in the health units of Distrito Sanit?rio III, in Jo?o Pessoa PB. It aimed at perceiving the knowledge of Health Communitarian Agents about reproductive rights and <b>man</b> <b>s</b> participation {{in the practice of}} these rights as well as identifying <b>man</b> <b>s</b> empowerment strategies while practicing the reproductive rights. Data were collected by means of interview fulfilled with 25 agents who make up the health family team of the mentioned study place, in the period from June to August 2012. For the accomplishment of the research the Resolution rules n? 196 / 96 of the Health National Council were observed in reference to research involving human beings and the Resolution n? 311 / 2007 of the Federal Council of Nursing by acquiring assent by the Research Ethics Committee of the Health Science Center of the Federal University of Para?ba, under the n? 0309 / 12 and CAEE: 02190312. 7. 0000. 5188. Data were analyzed through Bardin?s content analysis technique. Results realized that there are deficits regarding the health communitarian agents? understanding on reproductive rights and <b>man</b> <b>s</b> participation in actions involving reproductive health. Nevertheless, a real change in <b>man</b> <b>s</b> role about family planning and the follow-up of the pregnancy-puerperal cycle was revealed. Taking these findings into account, the agents pointed out the following aspects as possible strategies for <b>man</b> <b>s</b> empowerment in reproductive health promotion: domiciliary visit through dialogue committed with awareness for health care, major practice of Basic Attention while promoting the National Policy of Integral Attention to <b>Man</b> <b>s</b> Health as well as the construction of a methodology that favors the insertion of male population based on an inclusive policy. Therefore, it can be concluded that once cultural barrier is overcome, pertaining to discussion about the meaning of being male and female and reproductive health matters, man will be able to recognize himself as subject of reproductive rights acting as co-responsible in the actions of the couple s reproductive life...|$|R
