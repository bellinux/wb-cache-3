It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt <b>me</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E

[...] This fact does not impress <b>me</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> [...] Lawyers have been trained to take either side of any case and make the most intelligent and impassioned defense of their adopted viewpoint." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1810, {{he married}} the 19-year old Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, {{and a great}} niece of Marie Antoinette by proxy; thus he had married into a German royal and {{imperial}} family. [...] Louise was less than happy with the arrangement, at least at first, stating [...] "Just to see the man {{would be the worst}} form of torture". [...] Her great-aunt had been executed in France, while Napoleon had fought numerous campaigns against Austria all throughout his military career. [...] However, she seemed to warm up to him over time. [...] After her wedding, she wrote to her father [...] "He loves <b>me</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> I respond to his love sincerely. There is something very fetching and very eager about him that is impossible to resist".|$|E

500|$|Victoria took a great {{liking to}} Karim and ordered {{that he was}} to be given {{additional}} tuition in the English language. By February 1888 he had [...] "learnt English wonderfully" [...] according to Victoria. After he complained to the Queen that he had been a clerk in India and thus menial work as a waiter was beneath him, he was promoted to the position of [...] "Munshi" [...] in August 1888. In her journal, the Queen writes that she made this change so that he would stay: [...] "I particularly wish to retain his services as he helps me in studying Hindustani, which interests <b>me</b> <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> & he is very intelligent & useful." [...] Photographs of him waiting at table were destroyed and he became the first personal Indian clerk to the Queen. Buksh remained in the Queen's service, but only as a khidmatgar or table servant, until his death at Windsor in 1899.|$|E
500|$|Hill {{has participated}} in various {{television}} productions, such as Survival of the Fittest, which she won four seasons in a row, from 1980 to 1984; she beat Olympic athletes at rope climbing and cross-country running. It was rock climbing legend and personal hero Beverly Johnson who first asked Hill to compete. The inaugural year of the competition, the first prize for {{the men in the}} competition was US$15,000 and for the women, US$5,000. Angered, Hill asked for parity, arguing that since the women were competing in four events and the men six, the women should at least be awarded $10,000. She proposed a boycott to the other female competitors, negotiating a deal with the producer that the prize money would be raised the next year and she could compete again. In her autobiography, Hill writes that she heard a rumor that NBC canceled the women's half of the show because the producers could not find anyone to beat her. She [...] "became increasingly aware of how few women were pushing the limits of climbing and endurance like I was, and of how my passion had led <b>me</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> into a man's world". During the early 1980s Hill also appeared on The Guinness Game, That's Incredible!, and Ripley's Believe it or Not. She describes her feat of climbing over a hot-air balloon at 6,000 feet for That's Incredible! as [...] "perhaps the most ridiculous stunt I ever did". Despite the earlier television appearances Hill attributes her fame to a 1982 poster for the company Patagonia that showed a photograph of her climbing.|$|E

[...] Most AAs were strongly opposed to his experimenting with a mind-altering substance.|$|E

2500|$|Little else {{is known}} about Kierkegaard's {{attitude}} to Schopenhauer. On Schopenhauer himself, Kierkegaard felt that Schopenhauer would have been patronizing.

2500|$|In a pen {{portrait}} of herself executed later the same year, she noted {{how she was}} neither [...] "fat nor thin" [...] and [...] "looked healthy; my bosom is fairly well formed; my hands and arms not beautiful, but the skin is good...". The same year, she met Christina of Sweden, who had arrived in France in July 1656. The two ladies met at Essone where they watched a ballet together. Mademoiselle later exclaimed that Christina [...] "surprised <b>me</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> [...] She was in all respects a most extraordinary creature".|$|E

2500|$|On 8 September {{she arrived}} in Paris and was shown around; ladies were shocked by her {{masculine}} appearance and demeanor and the unguarded freedom of her conversation. When visiting the ballet with la Grande Mademoiselle, she, as the latter recalls, [...] "surprised <b>me</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> – applauding the parts which pleased her, taking God to witness, throwing herself back in her chair, crossing her legs, resting them on the arms of her chair, and assuming other postures, such as I had never seen taken but by Travelin and Jodelet, two famous buffoons... She was in all respects a most extraordinary creature".|$|E
2500|$|Scott Wilkinson of AVS was {{similarly}} {{impressed by the}} visual effects (though he did not enjoy the movie itself): [...] "Even sitting too far away, the movie itself looked gorgeous—sharp as a tack with beautiful colors. The smallest details, such as Jaden Smith's character in the far distance, somehow looked clearer than I would have expected under normal circumstances; I got the distinct impression that the image could have been blown up by quite a bit and no detail would have been lost. The CGI animals did look a bit artificial, but that didn't bother <b>me</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was quite}} {{intensely}} religious, {{because even though}} he uses the word Providence, he constantly sees Providence as an active force in life, particularly in American life. [...] I mean, every single victory in war he credits to Providence. [...] The miracle of the Constitutional Convention he credits to Providence. [...] The creation {{of the federal government}} and the prosperity of the early republic, he credits to Providence... I was struck at how frequently in his letters he's referring to Providence, and it's Providence where there's a sense of design and purpose, which sounds to <b>me</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like religion... Unfortunately, this particular issue has become very very politicized.|$|E

60|$|This was {{the perfect}} fact, as I must confess, and I declare {{that it was only}} because she amused me and delighted me, and {{provoked}} me, and made <b>me</b> laugh <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> and because, no doubt, she was very rich, that I had any attachment for her.|$|R
2500|$|Later that year, Connolly's {{mother went}} to meet him {{backstage}} after a Humblebums gig in Dunoon, where she {{was working in the}} cafeteria at Dunoon General Hospital. It was the second and final meeting between them since she abandoned Connolly. She had been living in the town with her partner, Willie Adams, with whom she had three daughters and a son. [...] "I went home to her house and stayed the night, instead of the hotel. The sadness is... She was a very nice woman, but we never got along. We both tried to like each other, and I don't think she liked <b>me</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> I don't regret it, but I'm sad about it. I wish I'd liked her. And I wish she'd liked me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Liberace sent a {{telegram}} that read: [...] "What you said hurt <b>me</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> I cried {{all the way}} to the bank." [...] He sued the newspaper for libel, testifying in a London court that he was not homosexual and that he had never taken part in homosexual acts. He was represented in court by one of the great barristers of the period, 75 year old Gilbert Beyfus, QC, who displayed all his old flair despite being unwell. [...] They won the suit, partly on the basis of Connor's use of the derogatory expression [...] "fruit-flavoured". The case partly hinged on whether Connor knew that 'fruit' was American slang implying that an individual is a homosexual. After a three-week civil trial, a jury ruled in Liberace's favor on June 16, 1959 and awarded him £8,000 (around $22,400) in damages (worth about £ or $ today) which led Liberace to repeat the catchphrase to reporters: [...] "I cried {{all the way to}} the bank!" [...] Liberace's popularization of the phrase inspired the title of Crying All the Way to the Bank, a detailed report of the trial based on transcripts, court reports, and interviews, by the former Daily Mirror journalist Revel Barker.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{studies of}} alcoholics who {{underwent}} LSD treatment reported a 50% success rate after a single high-dose session. However, {{the studies that}} reported high success rates had insufficient controls, lacked objective measures of genuine change, and failed to conduct rigorous follow-up interviews with subjects. The lack of conclusive evidence notwithstanding, individual case reports are often dramatic. Bill Wilson, the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous conducted medically supervised experiments in the 1950s {{on the effects of}} LSD on alcoholism. Bill is quoted as saying [...] "It is a generally acknowledged fact in spiritual development that ego reduction makes the influx of God's grace possible. If, therefore, under LSD we can have a temporary reduction, so that we can better see what we are and where we are going—well, that might be of some help. The goal might become clearer. So I consider LSD to be of some value to some people, and practically no damage to anyone. It will never take the place of any of the existing means by which we can reduce the ego, and keep it reduced." [...] Wilson felt that regular usage of LSD in a carefully controlled, structured setting would be beneficial for many recovering alcoholics. However, he felt this method only should be attempted by individuals with well-developed super-egos. In 1957 Wilson wrote a letter to Heard saying: [...] "I am certain that the LSD experiment has helped <b>me</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> I find myself with a heightened colour perception and an appreciation of beauty almost destroyed by my years of depressions." [...] Most AA members were strongly opposed to his experimenting with a mind-altering substance.|$|E
