40|$|The Unified Data System (UDS) {{group at}} JPL is {{attempting}} to reduce total <b>mission</b> <b>costs</b> by designing a spacecraft data system which {{takes advantage of the}} natural and historical partitioning of a spacecraft into subsystems. Each subsystem is assigned a microprocessor which needs just enough capability to control the sensors and actuators of that subsystem, collect its data and maintain time synchronization {{with the rest of the}} spacecraft. The resulting distributed system avoids many of the overhead costs of a single centralized multi-processing system. To minimize complexity and therefore minimize total <b>mission</b> <b>costs,</b> a variety of standards and restrictions are imposed on the design of hardware, software, and communications. Articulation of these standards and restrictions is a major benefit deriving from the UDS program...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of solar}} sail {{propulsion}} is investigated for both Mercury orbiter (MO) and Mercury sample return missions (MeSR). It will be demonstrated that solar sail propulsion can significantly reduce launch mass and enhance payload mass fractions for MO missions, while MeSR missions are enabled, {{again with a}} relatively low launch mass. Previous investigations of MeSR type missions using solar electric propulsion have identified a requirement for an Ariane V launcher to deliver a lander and sample return vehicle. The analysis {{presented in this paper}} demonstrates that, in principle, a MeSR mission can be enabled using a single Soyuz-Fregat launch vehicle, leading to significant reductions in launch mass and <b>mission</b> <b>costs.</b> Similarly, it will be demonstrated that the full payload of the ESA Bepi Colombo orbiter mission can be delivered to Mercury using a Soyuz-Fregat launch vehicle, rather than Ariane V, again leading to a reduction in <b>mission</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|E
40|$|Solar array {{systems have}} been studied and {{compared}} for earth orbital and orbit transfer missions with the principal objective of quantifying the cost tradeoffs between gallium arsenide and silicon array for specific classes of missions and system characteristics.

The use of reflectors for concentration may significantly reduce the power system cost. However, GaAs arrays benefit considerably more from solar concentration than Si arrays in terms of <b>mission</b> <b>cost</b> because of their higher allowable temperature.
