25|$|During the Second World War paper {{shortages}} had {{a serious}} impact on pulp production, starting a steady rise in costs {{and the decline of}} the pulps. Beginning with Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine in 1941, pulp magazines began to switch to digest size; smaller, thicker magazines. In 1949, Street & Smith closed most of their pulp magazines in order to <b>move</b> <b>upmarket</b> and produce slicks.|$|E
25|$|The {{recession}} {{of the early}} 1990s impacted on the average household budget, and affected the amount of disposable income that the average consumer had to spend, and with rising inflation it hit Asda customers whose stores were more heavily concentrated in the north than in the more affluent south east harder. The <b>move</b> <b>upmarket</b> had also pushed in-store service and labour costs up which impacted on profit margins and sales.|$|E
500|$|The Sovereign, {{released}} in 1976, represented {{an attempt to}} <b>move</b> <b>upmarket</b> in an increasingly saturated market. In December 1976, the chrome plated version of the Sovereign cost [...] and the gold-plated version , including VAT, but profit margins on the Sovereign were so small that Sinclair ended up selling the Sovereign at a loss, {{and it was not}} a commercial success. The Sovereign was made in England, like every other Sinclair calculator except the President.|$|E

50|$|Its styling was {{reflective}} {{of a new}} design direction at Renault, symbolised by the radical Vel Satis and Avantime models, marking a major departure from the previous model, which also saw the range <b>moved</b> <b>upmarket.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The automaker {{decided to}} <b>move</b> <b>upmarket,</b> and in 1930 {{launched}} {{a line of}} cars called Great Eight. Hudson Eights were [...] "often luxurious, and usually smooth, effortless performers" [...] powered by a new for 1930 straight-eight engine that would be produced through 1952. Total production in 1930 for Hudson Motors fell by almost 40% to 113,898 units.|$|E
2500|$|In 1957, Cadillac {{attempted}} to <b>move</b> <b>upmarket,</b> creating the hand-built Series 70 Eldorado Brougham. It featured self-levelling suspension, [...] "memory seat" [...] function, and an all-transistor signal-seeking car radio that {{was produced by}} GM's Delco Radio and which was available as standard equipment for the 1957 Eldorado Brougham models. While the car showed Cadillac's technological prowess, it only sold 904 units.|$|E
50|$|Commercial {{success for}} the BMW 326, {{introduced}} in 1936, encouraged a <b>move</b> <b>upmarket.</b> This would involve BMW in challenging the dominance then enjoyed by Mercedes-Benz over a lucrative sector, with their 320 and 340 models.|$|E
5000|$|Åhléns {{stores have}} now been {{converted}} into department stores and <b>moved</b> <b>upmarket,</b> and now concentrate on four business areas: Fashion (Mode), Beauty (Skönhet), Homeware (Hem), and Media. [...] Åhléns' loyalty card is called the Åhléns Club.|$|R
25|$|The first {{generation}} LaCrosse replaced the Century and Regal in North America {{beginning in the}} 2005 model year, serving as the brand's mid-size car. For 2010, the LaCrosse was completely redesigned and <b>moved</b> <b>upmarket</b> as a large premium sedan. The model was redesigned again for 2017.|$|R
50|$|Richer Sounds was {{initially}} known for selling budget audio equipment in a ‘pile it high {{and sell it}} cheap’ fashion, {{but in recent years}} it has <b>moved</b> <b>upmarket,</b> and expanded its range and service offering from just audio products to encompass television, home cinema equipment and installations.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} renamed Falcon Cars in 1961 {{to reflect the}} <b>move</b> <b>upmarket</b> and the four seat Bermuda was introduced. About the same time, the 1000 was developed. This was later marketed as the Peregrine.|$|E
50|$|The Goliath 1100 - {{introduced}} in 1957 - is a substantially restyled {{continuation of the}} GP700 model, but it also represents a significant <b>move</b> <b>upmarket</b> with a larger four-stroke four-cylinder engine, anticipating by nearly a decade the switch away from two-stroke power plants by {{other members of the}} two-stroke club.|$|E
50|$|Marketing {{opportunities}} {{were identified}} in Europe where Alfa Romeo's locally designed attempt to <b>move</b> <b>upmarket</b> had made little impact on the competition from Bavaria: the Brazilian Alfa Romeo was offered briefly in 1981 under the designation Alfa Rio and distributed by Alfa Romeo Germany. Additionally, around 600 of the cars were shipped to The Netherlands.|$|E

50|$|In August 2016, Buick {{decided to}} end Excelle {{production}} despite strong sales, with 2.68 million units sold {{over the course}} of 13 years. Citing its low price while the brand <b>moves</b> <b>upmarket</b> as a main reason, there will be no direct successor, with Chevrolet and Wuling filling in the low-end market niche left unoccupied by the departure of the Excelle.|$|R
5000|$|On April 11, 2017, Buick {{unveiled}} {{the second generation}} Enclave at the Pier 59 Studios during the 2017 New York Auto Show. With {{the introduction of the}} mid-size Buick Envision in 2016 and the launching of the Opel Insignia-badged Buick Regal TourX wagon, the next generation Enclave <b>moved</b> <b>upmarket,</b> competing with the Volvo XC90, Infiniti QX60, and Acura MDX in the premium crossover SUV market.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, Mercury {{was usually}} {{considered}} a [...] "lower-medium-priced" [...] car, most often compared to Pontiac and Dodge. Under Breech's plan Mercury would <b>move</b> <b>upmarket</b> and compete more directly with Buick, Oldsmobile, Chrysler and DeSoto and the Edsel {{would take over}} Mercury's previous role as the lower-medium-priced car and compete more directly with Pontiac and Dodge.|$|E
50|$|Superdrug {{continued}} to grow over the next 8 years, increasing profitability and market share. In 1995, the company began a rebranding programme, which saw it leave behind its discount heritage and <b>move</b> <b>upmarket,</b> with a new corporate identity - under the banner “the real beauty is the price” - and new larger stores in prime retail locations.|$|E

50|$|Dodge <b>moved</b> <b>upmarket</b> {{with the}} Custom Royal in the mid-1950s, which cut into and eroded DeSoto's {{traditional}} market segment. The {{introduction of the}} 1957 DeSoto Firesweep, a model that used the Dodge engine, chassis, front fenders, and hood, pushed DeSoto down into Dodge territory competing directly against the Custom Royal. The Firesweep sold well, but {{at the expense of}} the higher priced Firedome and Fireflite models. The DeSoto began looking like a Chrysler with a different grille and taillights, which, in an era of strong make identification, was a recipe for disaster.|$|R
50|$|Fitting {{the body}} of the former first-generation Simca Vedette with a 1290cc (7CV) Flash four {{cylinder}} engine from the much smaller Simca Aronde produced a car that focused on economy rather than speedy acceleration. Presented in April 1957, the Ariane filled the gap between Aronde and Vedette. In October of the same year, the Ariane 8 was presented - a version powered by the same Aquillon 2351 cc (13CV) V-eight-cylinder unit that powered the Vedette. The Ariane 8 effectively replaced the former Simca Trianon, which was a bottom-of-the-range Vedette, as the Vedette range was <b>moved</b> <b>upmarket.</b> The Ariane 8 would be discontinued along with the company's other V8 powered models in 1961, however.|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s, M.Y Corporation,Rukunuddin Construction Company and Hasan Associate {{come in to}} {{construction}} arena with a commitment to provide low cost housing and followed Al Azam's footstep. The company, which was formed by a retired overseer from the Pakistan Works Department (PWD), also introduced low-cost prefabricated housing units, {{in addition to their}} regular low-priced apartments. The quality and safety of their units, however, were generally viewed as inferior. Maymar, another construction company, entered the market in the late 1970s, with residential apartments and housing units that were probably the best ever built, and they were highly successful. As demand for better housing accommodation increased, Maymar <b>moved</b> <b>upmarket,</b> leaving behind the low-cost housing sector.|$|R

40|$|The authors {{examine whether}} private tenants {{receiving}} housing benefit {{have sought to}} take advantage of the perverse incentives which exist in the scheme. They look at recipients' reasons for moving to their present accommodation, whether they shopped around for accommodation, whether they <b>moved</b> <b>upmarket</b> to better accommodation, and whether they paid a premium for their accommodation compared with nonrecipients. It is concluded that, despite the perverse incentives, recipients had not generally moved {{to take advantage of}} the scheme, had shopped around for accommodation, and were not paying a 'housing benefit premium'. Although some recipients were paying over the odds for their accommodation this reflected their poor position in the housing market compared with nonrecipients rather than a deliberate attempt {{to take advantage of the}} scheme. ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1975, the Cougar XR-7 {{continued}} {{to add more}} luxury features as it <b>moved</b> <b>upmarket.</b> But with more features, the Cougar was gaining in weight, as well. Compared to the 1967 version, the 1975 version weighed a full 1,000 lb (450 kg) more. Despite the added weight, the buying public wanted the Cougar, and sales figures reflected that fact. For the performance fans, however, a high-performance rear axle and 'Traction-Lok' differential {{continued to}} be on the option sheet. The standard engine continued to be the [...] 351 Windsor two-barrel V8 with the [...] 400 two-barrel V8 and [...] 460 four-barrel V8 optional. Visually, the only change from 1974 was the addition of two rectangular openings in the center section of the front bumper.|$|R
5000|$|Hugo Geiger died in 1874. The {{guest house}} {{was taken over}} by his eldest son, Franz Geiger, and his wife, Nina (born Nina Kriß) {{who was a member of}} the local brewing family. During the next two decades the hotel {{underwent}} major expansion and <b>moved</b> <b>upmarket.</b> In 1884 rooms in the Main Building were redesigned and elegantly furnished. The architect Wicklein was employed to design a two storey annex (later known as the [...] "Dependance") to the north of the main building, and this opened in 1890. By 1924 Rudolf Geiger, grandson of the hotel founder, had taken over, and that year he opened a gas/petrol station beside the hotel for the convenience of guests. It was the first gas/petrol station in the locality.|$|R

50|$|The DAF 44 is a {{small family}} car that was {{introduced}} in September 1966 by the Dutch company DAF. It was the first car to be built at the company's new plant at Born in Limburg. Styled by Michelotti, it represented a cautious <b>move</b> <b>upmarket</b> for the company which hitherto had produced, for the passenger car market, only the smaller slower Daffodil model (subsequently rebadged as the DAF 33 to align with the form of nomenclature introduced with the 44).|$|E

Sales dropped in later years as the Japanese yen rose in value against the dollar and made the vehicle more expensive than its rivals. Additionally, more powerful V8 sport sedans provided strong competition. By 1997, the price of the GS 300 had risen to [...] Production of the first generation GS sedan ended in July 1997.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "preppy" [...] trend cooled in {{the late}} 1980s and the brand became overexposed. The market was also {{saturated}} with knock-off replicas. The name was split in the early 1990s when Crystal sought to expand company sales. Lacoste <b>moved</b> <b>upmarket</b> {{in an attempt to}} recapture its [...] "elite" [...] status. Meanwhile, Izod was re-introduced as mid-range apparel. While this tactic worked for a short period, it could not support Crystal's company, which was heavily in debt due to poor investments in other brands such as Salty Dog, and Gant. The marketing license was ended in the mid-1990s after his company became too financially burdened. In 1993, he sold his 50% share of Lacoste to Sportloisirs S.A. (who originally marketed the shirt in France). When the company folded shortly thereafter, Izod was sold to the shirtmaker Van Heusen.|$|R
5000|$|... 1973 Chevrolets {{featured}} a larger, shock-absorbing front bumper due to new federal mandates which required 5 mph impact protection. New taillights were {{mounted in the}} (still) conventional rear bumper. The convertible was <b>moved</b> <b>upmarket</b> to the Caprice Classic series. Tweaks to the suspension and frame gave better roadability, according to Chevrolet general manager John Z. DeLorean. Steering wheels and instrument panels were color-keyed to interior colors, {{as opposed to the}} matte black used in 1971-1972. The steering wheel rim got a soft-feel grip, and replaced the [...] "Impala" [...] badge with generic [...] "Chevrolet." [...] The inline six-cylinder engine was now offered on the Bel Air 4-door sedan only, and only with the 3-speed manual transmission. Interiors had repositioned front seats for more legroom. The Impala name returned for the Kingswood station wagon. Suspension and chassis design was modified for better roadability.|$|R
