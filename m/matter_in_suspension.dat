5000|$|The NPSG is {{not often}} sampled because of its {{distance}} from the coast and its shortage of marine life. These vast and deep ocean waters, far from the influence of land, have historically been considered the oceanic equivalent of terrestrial deserts, with low standing stocks of biomass and low production rates. This perspective is derived from a dearth of comprehensive investigation of central gyre habitats. Over {{the past two decades}} these views have been challenged with a newfound understanding of the dynamics of the NPSG.During the early days of marine exploration, the HMS Challenger (1872-1876), on its leg from Yokohama to Honolulu, collected plant and animal specimens as well as numerous seawater samples. The goals of this expedition were to determine the chemical composition of seawater and the organic <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>suspension</b> and to study the distribution and abundance of various communities of organisms. The motivation for studying open ocean ecosystems has changed over time, whereas today more modern studies focus on biodiversity and the effects of climate on ecosystem dynamics. Today, the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program has assembled the largest and most comprehensive ecological data set for the NPSG and is scheduled to continue to the next millennium. [...] Programs like HOT have debunked the hypothesis that this ecosystem is static and homogenous, finding that the NPSG exhibits dynamic seasonal patterns separating it from other open ocean systems.|$|E

The six catchments ranged in size from 1. 42 to 5. 41 km 2. The percentage of forest cover ranged from 30 to 97 %.

40|$|A {{three year}} study of benthic algae of the unchannelized Missouri River was {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} effects of diurnal water level fluctuations below hydroelectric dams on algal biomass, productivity, and community structure. The contribution of benthic algae to the particulate organic matter pool in suspension was also examined. ^ A reduction of the epilithic algal biomass of up to 150 -fold occurred in the presence of diurnal water level fluctuations. Rates of benthic primary productivity were also strongly depressed, and benthic algal community structure was altered and diversity reduced. The epilithic portion of the algal community was suppressed at an early successional stage. Without diurnal fluctuations, the climax epilithic algal community was dominated by the filamentous green alga, Cladophora glomerata, with its epiphytic diatoms. Frequent fluctuations also appeared to increase drift of benthic algae and aquatic macroinvertebrates in this system. Diurnal water level fluctuations functioned ecologically as a frequent disturbance or an acute stress to the benthic algal community in the Missouri River. ^ Suspended benthic algae in the Missouri River contributed 0. 2 - 0. 6 % of the total organic carbon; planktonic algae contributed 2. 3 - 6. 8 %. Of the fine particulate organic carbon (FPOC) fraction, 7. 2 - 21. 8 % resulted from autochthonous primary production. Dissolved organic carbon was 59 % of the total organic <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>suspension.</b> ^ An average of 37. 3 % of coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) was autochthonous in origin, with greater amounts produced in backwaters than at main channel sites.

Experiments were designed for analytical purposes with three selected waste brines originating from different clean solutions and salting process conditions, and processing as well as plant parameters (for example, economics, environment, technical availabilities) were considered. In this regard, several chemical and physical pretreatments were first conducted to increase the size of suspended solids (SS) and to reduce the proteinaceous <b>matters</b> <b>in</b> the <b>suspension.</b> Treated suspensions and their separated phases after settling were subjected to various filtration experiments. Crossflow micro- and ultra-filtration pilot trials (tubular ceramic membranes) showed their inefficiency in terms of permeation flux density, even at high temperature. This was mainly because of the high viscosity of solutions which in turn lowered the shear stress near the membrane. Laboratory- and industrial-scale cake filtration experiments using a rotary vacuum precoat filter (RVPF) were also conducted to find the optimal filtration conditions with the help of a unifying filterability parameter. The best coupling appeared to be pH pretreatment, followed by a settling time adjusted to the salting process conditions.

The fraction of the particulate <b>matter</b> remaining <b>in</b> <b>suspension</b> after a given time was measured {{as an indication of}} coagulation rate. The coagulation rate increased with increasing shock strength, but the rate of increase became gradually less as the shock strength increased. The initial particle concentration, the degree of dispersion, and the polydispersity were three major factors that influenced the rate of coagulation upon shock treatment. Organic vapors, i. e., acetone, carbon tetrachloride, and acetic acid, stabilized the aerosol but their presence enhanced the coagulation process upon shock treatment. The presence of water vapor resulted in a slight increase of coagulation rate, but the rate became relatively insensitive to increasing shock strength. Analysis of the particles showed substantial increases in size and a distinct change in their distribution after shock treatments. The experimental results could be explained in terms of increased particle collision probability. A model for the increased collision probability among particles in the shock tube was proposed. The total number of collision per unit volume per unit time was expressed in terms of particle size, particle number, and differential velocity acquired due to the differential acceleration of the particles.

Self-propulsion profoundly affects the equation of state, but these changes can be rationalized using equilibrium concepts. We show that active colloids behave, in the dilute limit, as an ideal gas with an activity-dependent effective temperature. At finite density, increasing the activity is similar to increasing adhesion between equilibrium particles.

Rates of acetate formation from endogenous organic <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> soil-water <b>suspensions</b> incubated at 40, 30, and 15 (deg) C approximated 3. 3, 2. 4, and 1. 1 (mu) g of acetate per g (dry weight) of soil per h, respectively. Supplemental H(inf 2) and CO(inf 2) were subject to consumption with the apparent concomitant synthesis of acetate <b>in</b> both soil <b>suspensions</b> and soil microcosms. In soil microcosms, rates of H(inf 2) -dependent acetogenesis at 30 and 55 (deg) C were nearly equivalent. The uptake of supplemental H(inf 2) was not coupled to methanogenesis under any condition examined. These anaerobic activities were relatively stable when soils were subjected to either aerobic drying or alternating periods of O(inf 2) enrichment.

However, if considering the development of woody vegetated patches over a time scale of decades, we must consider {{the extent to which}} soil forming processes, particularly related to soil organic matter, impact the alluvial geomorphic-vegetation system. Here we quantify the soil organic matter processing (humification) that occurs on young alluvial landforms. We sampled different geomorphic units, ranging from the active river channel to established river terraces in a braided river system. For each geomorphic unit, soil pits were used to sample sediment/soil layers that were analysed in terms of grain size (< 2 mm) and organic matter quantity and quality (RockEval method). A principal components analysis was used to identify patterns in the dataset. Results suggest that during the succession from bare river gravels to a terrace soil, there is a transition from small amounts of external organic matter supply provided by sedimentation processes (e. g. organic <b>matter</b> transported <b>in</b> <b>suspension</b> and deposited on bars), to large amounts of autogenic <b>in</b> situ organic <b>matter</b> production due to plant colonisation. This appears to change the time scale and pathways of alluvial succession (bio-geomorphic succession). However, this process is complicated by: the ongoing possibility of local sedimentation, which can serve to isolate surface layers via aggradation from the exogenic supply; and erosion which tends to create fresh deposits upon which organic matter processing must re-start. The result is a complex pattern of organic matter states as well as a general lack of any clear chronosequence within the active river corridor. This state reflects the continual battle between deposition events that can isolate organic matter from the surface, erosion events that can destroy accumulating organic matter and the early ecosystem processes necessary to assist the co-evolution of soil and vegetation.

Higher densities of prawns (starting at 25 or 50 per tank) caused an elevation of these macronutrients in the water column.

Heterogeneity in habitatand food availability likely enhances trophic diversity in canyons. Given their abundance in theworld’s oceans, our results from Baltimore Canyon suggest that submarine canyons may representimportant havens for trophic diversity...|$|R

40|$|Human {{activities}} and atmospheric pollution impact coastal ecosystems at different {{rate in the}} world. The oceans contain {{a wide range of}} animal species that are harvested for human consumption. It is estimated that more than 2 billion people world-wide depend on protein from seas and coastal habitats, yet it is into this environment that anthropogenic pollutants often accumulate. Contamination of seafood is inevitable. The word ―mussel‖ is frequently used to name the edible bivalves of the marine family Mytilidae, most of which live on exposed shores in the intertidal zone, attached by means of their strong byssal threads to a firm substrate. Mussels are stationary filter feeders that filter large quantities of seawater, keeping in this way large amounts of pollutants, and constitute a source of contaminants for marine organisms that feed on them. As they accumulate pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs, polychlorobiphenyls, PCBs, organochlorine compounds, OCs) efficiently, they can be used in water monitoring programs. Similarly to other invertebrates mussels show a slow metabolic rate and consequently a slow xenobiotic biotransformation. Mussels filter suspended matter from the water column and deposit it as feces and pseudofeces. The food of mussels consists of particulate organic matter and other microscopic sea creatures which are free-floating in seawater. Organic matter is produced in the water column (phytoplankton) and the waves are very important for the availability of this food because they cause turbulence and keep organic <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>suspension.</b> Mussels serve as an important food source {{for a wide range of}} organisms (e. g., starfish, eider ducks, some predatory marine gastropods and oystercatchers) and are also eaten by humans. As a matter of fact they contribute to the PCBs, PAHs and OCs intake in human being. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Male gladiator frogs of Hypsiboas Wagler, 1830 build nests on {{available}} substrate surrounding {{ponds and}} streams where female spawn eggs during the breeding period. Although gladiator frogs seem to show plasticity {{in the way}} they construct their nests, there is no study reporting if these species present preferences about microhabitat conditions for nest-building (mainly under subtropical climate). Predation pressure and environmental conditions have been considered major processes shaping the great diversity of reproductive strategies performed by amphibians, but microhabitat conditions should explain where to build a nest as well as how nest looks. This study aimed to test nest site selection for nest-building by Hypsiboas faber(Wied-Neuwied, 1821), determining which factors are related to nest site selection and nest features. The survey was conducted at margins of two permanent ponds in Southern Brazil. Habitat factors were evaluated in 18 plots with nest and 18 plots in the surrounding without nest (control), describing vegetation structure and heterogeneity, and substrate characteristics. Water temperature was measured inside the nest and in its adjacency. Nest features assessed were area, depth and temperature. Habitat characteristics differed between plots with and without nest. Microhabitat selected for nest-building was characterized by great vegetation cover and height, as well as shallower water and lower cover of organic <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>suspension</b> than in plots without nest. Differences between temperature inside nest and in its adjacency were not observed. No relationship between nest features and habitat descriptors was evidenced. Results revealed that Hypsiboas faber does not build nests anywhere. Males seem to prefer more protected habitats, probably avoiding predation, invasion of conspecific males and inclement weather. Lack of differences between temperature inside- and outside-nest suggest that nest do not improve this condition for eggs and tadpole development. Nest architecture was not related to habitat characteristics, which may be determined by other factors, as nest checking by females before amplexus. Nest site selection should increase offspring survival as well the breeding success of Hypsiboas faber...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the physical and}} chemical properties of 17 Afroalpine lakes (> 2 m deep) and 11 pools (< 2 m deep) in the Rwenzori mountains, Uganda-DR Congo, with the aim to establish the baseline conditions against which to evaluate future environmental and biological changes in these unique tropical ecosystems, and to provide the foundation for lake-based paleoenvironmental studies. Most Rwenzori lakes are located above 3, 500 m elevation, and dilute (5 - 52 mu S/cm specific conductance at 25 degrees C) open systems with surface in- and outflow. Multivariate ordination and pairwise correlations between environmental variables mainly differentiate between (1) lakes located near or above 4, 000 m (3, 890 - 4, 487 m), with at least some direct input of glacial meltwater and surrounded by rocky catchments or alpine vegetation; and (2) lakes located mostly below 4, 000 m (2, 990 4, 054 m), remote from glaciers and surrounded by Ericaceous vegetation and/or bogs. The former group are mildly acidic to neutral clearwater lakes (surface pH: 5. 80 - 7. 82; Secchi depth: 120 - 280 cm) with often above-average dissolved ion concentrations (18 - 52 mu S/cm). These lakes are (ultra-) oligotrophic to mesotrophic (TP: 3. 1 - 12. 4 mu g/l; Chl-a: 0. 3 - 10. 9 mu g/l) and phosphorus-limited (mass TN/TP: 22. 9 - 81. 4). The latter group are mildly to strongly acidic (pH: 4. 30 - 6. 69) waters stained by dissolved organic carbon (DOC: 6. 8 - 13. 6 mg/l) and more modest transparency (Secchi-disk depth: 60 - 132 cm). Ratios of particulate carbon, particulate nitrogen and chlorophyll a in these lakes indicate that organic <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>suspension</b> is primarily derived from the lakes' catchments rather than aquatic primary productivity. Since key features in the Rwenzori lakes' abiotic environment are strongly tied to temperature and catchment hydrology, these Afroalpine lake ecosystems can be expected to respond sensitively to climate change and glacier melting...|$|E
40|$|The Belgian {{coastal zone}} is shallow, well mixed {{and has a}} high {{hydrodynamic}} energy. In the coastal zone a turbidity maximum occurs, {{which is responsible for}} high dredging amounts. Every year about 10 x 10 (6) ton dry matter (TDM) is dredged for the maintenance of the harbours and the navigation channels. After dumping the <b>matter</b> is transported <b>in</b> <b>suspension.</b> The amount of maintenance dredging works is depending on the local hydrodynamic conditions and of the natural sediment transport as well as the amount and frequency of the dumping and dredging works. In order to estimate the efficiency of the dumping sites the natural cohesive sediment transport has to be known. Numerical models can be used to simulate this natural sediment transport. The uncertainties or variability of the sediment transport measurement data are high, in contrast with the dredging and dumping data, which are well known. The natural sediment transport is partly formed by the continuous erosion and deposition during a tide, a neap-spring cycle and during storms. This article will focus on the results of numerical simulations of the sediment transport. In particular the natural sediment transport of mud, the effect of dumping of dredged matter and the efficiency of the dumping sites will be discussed. This discussion is preceded by an overview of the physical situation (hydrodynamics, sediment transport, dredging and dumping data) and a description of the numerical models used (hydrodynamic model, wave model and sediment transport model) ...|$|R
