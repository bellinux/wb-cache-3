Its construction utilizes a modular approach based on the fundamental philosophy of Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). The proposed architecture uniquely integrates System Decomposition, System Evaluation, Failure Analysis, Logic Tree Analysis, and Maintenance Planning modules. It presents an ideal solution to the unique maintenance inadequacies of modern discrete part manufacturing systems. Well established techniques are incorporated as building blocks of the system 2 ̆ 7 s modules. These include Failure Mode Effect and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), Logic Tree Analysis (LTA), Theory of Constraints (TOC), and an Expert System (ES). A <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> (MIS) performs the system 2 ̆ 7 s support functions. Validation was performed by field testing of the system at a Miami based manufacturing facility. Such a maintenance support system potentially reduces downtime losses and contributes to higher product quality output. Ultimately improved profitability is the final outcome. ...|$|E

The basic idea of hybrid models is to combine the merits of PCR and PLS to develop more accurate prediction techniques. Both the principal components defined in PCR and the latent variables in PLS are involved in a hybrid model. The experimental results show that an optimal hybrid model can outperform PCR and PLS, especially when the number of predictor variables increases. It suggests that the proposed approach may be particularly useful for complex prediction tasks that need more predictor variables. Discussions for future research are also presented...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn recent years, a {{great deal}} of {{attention}} has been paid to the analysis of failure modes occurring in railway infrastructure assets, e. g. bridges, rail tracks, sleepers, etc. However, there have been few attempts by researchers to develop failure criticality assessment models for railway rolling stock. A rolling stock failure may be very costly in terms of monetary loss and/or passenger inconvenience. It may also cause delays to train services or even result in catastrophic derailment accidents. In this paper, a failure mode, effects and criticality analysis approach is presented to identify, analyse and evaluate the causes and consequences of rolling stock failures. The most critical failure modes with respect to both reliability and economics are identified and potential protective measures are then proposed to prevent their recurrence. For the purpose of illustrating the proposed approach, the model is applied to a rolling stock passenger door system.

40|$|In {{addition}} to managing day-to-day <b>maintenance,</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> managers {{need to be}} able to predict and plan the longer-term evolution of software systems on an objective, quantified basis. Currently this is a difficult task, particularly when an information system is deeply embedded in an organisation's business processes. Although previous work, notably by Lehman et al., has shown that the evolution of such embedded software systems can be characterised as a complex feedback process, more work is needed to solve the practical problems of managing software evolution. In this paper we present an approach to understanding software evolution that is based around the quantifiable concept of evolvability. This concept brings together the study of software product quality, the software evolution process, and their relationships with the organisational environment. We assess the opportunities for analysing and measuring evolvability at pre-design, architectural, and source code stages in the development of software. We also describe work in progress on models of software evolution. We present a definition of software product evolvability in terms of a software quality model. We have also proposed a set of metrics derived from our model, which will enable objective assessments to be made of the evolutionary history and evolvability of software products. In order to validate these metrics we need a model of software evolution dynamics and we present some initial results on developing predictive models of software product evolution.

In this way, more effective strategies may be formulated and targeted at these focal causes. Despite the increased adoption of <b>maintenance</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> and as such, availability of maintenance data, few techniques so far developed leverage on the maintenance data for decision support in root cause analysis. A particular focus in this regard relates to application of techniques for data mining such as association rule mining. In particular, association rule mining is attractive {{in the sense of}} analyzing failure associations embedded in the maintenance data. Thus, this study proposes a methodology for enhancing decision support for root cause analysis in maintenance decision making. The methodology leverages on two association rule mining algorithms - Apriori and Predictive Apriori. Moreover, the methodology incorporates a data standardization step, whereof standard terms and vocabulary are adopted from the ISO 14224 and used for standardizing the equipment failure descriptions. Thereafter, the standardized descriptions are applied as input to an association rule mining framework from which important failure associations are extracted and validated by experts for relevancy. After which, the extracted failure associations are used to generate causal maps, and from the maps, the focal root causes of the equipment failure are identified. The added value of the proposed methodology is demonstrated in the application case of thermal power plant maintenance data. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} team recognized {{the value of}} network-level Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) testing to evaluate the structural condition trends of flexible pavements. However, practical limitations due {{to the cost of}} testing, traffic control and safety concerns and the ability to test a large network may discourage some agencies from conducting the network-level FWD testing. For this reason, the surrogate measure of the Structural Condition Index (SCI) is suggested for use. The main purpose of the research presented in this paper is to investigate data mining strategies and to develop a prediction method of the structural condition trends for network-level applications which does not require FWD testing.

These systems have been in operation {{for more than two}} years. Currently, there are four maintenance information systems in use at Infragas, these are; alarm management, deviation management, overall efficiency management, and rotating equipment management. The information from these systems is stored on intranet portals which are accessible to all Infragas employees. This paper aimed to analyse {{the extent to which these}} portals are being utilised by Infragas employees, if at all. This paper also investigated the employees’ mind-set towards the maintenance information systems. This will assist in understanding which systems enhancements can be made to further improve employee engagement. These objectives were achieved by means of two methods. The first method was an actual usage measurement. This identified which employees were using the portals, as well as the usage frequency. This investigation method gave a real indication of the system usage and highlighted any shortfalls in employees’ interaction with the portals. The second method was a questionnaire, given to Infragas employees. The first section analysed whether the Infragas maintenance information systems are an accepted technology by investigating whether systems are being used by portal users. This was done by means of a technology acceptance model. The questionnaire also aimed to gather information on portal quality characteristics. This would indicate which quality characteristics are important to Infragas employees. <b>Maintenance</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> quality needs will differ from employee to employee. This information could improve the quality of interaction between the employees and the portals. The questionnaire also aimed to examine employees’ attitudes towards maintenance information systems.

These investigations revealed valuable information for the improvement of these systems. The connection between the results of the two methods also indicated if both methods were valid.
