40|$|Private searching on {{streaming}} data {{is a process}} to dispatch to a public server a program, which searches streaming sources of data without revealing <b>searching</b> <b>criteria</b> and then sends back a buffer containing the findings. From an Abelian group homomorphic encryption, the <b>searching</b> <b>criteria</b> can be constructed by only simple combinations of keywords, e. g., disjunction of keywords. The recent breakthrough in fully homomorphic encryption has allowed us to construct arbitrary <b>searching</b> <b>criteria</b> theoretically. In this paper, we consider a (t, n) threshold query, which searches for documents containing more than t out of n keywords. This form of query can help us find more relevant documents.

We will show that with k-d-m tree, not only <b>minima</b> <b>searching</b> can be done very eciently, but also the existing operations for searching and updating on multi-dimensional tree can be performed as usual. In addition, we demonstrate how a multi-dimensional minima-searching problem can be solved recursively by decreasing the dimensionality. 1 Introduction The <b>minima</b> <b>searching</b> problem, an important computational geometry problem [CT 92][Cha 94], is to determine whether a k-dimensional point is minimal among a set of points.

40|$|Abstract. Information seekers, {{especially}} {{in the area of}} job hunting, often know their preferences, at least approximately. Most existing search tools running within job portals allow users to define their preferences by means of explicitly stated <b>search</b> <b>criteria.</b> They often suffer the same problem: If there exists an interesting job for the user which do not fulfill the criteria exactly, they will not find it. The job applicant is then forced to reformulate the search question and start the searching over. We propose a searching mechanism which uses the <b>search</b> <b>criteria</b> as a description of an ideal offer and matches it with the offers in an offer database. Each found offer in the more or less near neighborhood of the ideal offer is rated with a value based on the distance between the offer and the ideal offer. The searching mechanism is augmented by other user dependendent characteristics of <b>search</b> <b>criteria,</b> namely importance, precision and obligation in order to increase its efficiency. ...|$|R
