It produces a high PSV gritstone, for which there is an increasingly important market for wearing courses in road making and repair. In addition, the quarry also produces aggregates for the construction industry and materials for a concrete batching plant located at the eastern end of the site. Quarrying for gritstone commenced at Venn in the 1930s, which predated the introduction of the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 and it has been in continuous operation since.

40|$|<b>Mineral</b> <b>waste</b> {{is largely}} an {{unavoidable}} by-product of the extraction, processing {{and production of}} mineral-based products. The UK is well-endowed with mineral resources which have been worked {{for thousands of years}} resulting in millions of tonnes of <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> across the country. The most significant mineral resource worked was coal with more than 26, 000 million tonnes of coal produced and 3600 million tonnes of waste rock. Other significant volumes of <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> were derived from metal mining including tin, copper, lead and iron ore. Also a considerable volume was derived from the production of industrial and construction minerals such as brick clay, building stone, china clay, salt and slate. Currently the largest volumes of <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> produced in the UK are those associated with the production of construction aggregate from hard rock quarries and sand and gravel operations. The amount of <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> produced in the UK is currently not known in detail. Any figures for <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> are usually based on calculations that rely on the amount of saleable products recorded in the Annual Minerals Raised inquiry. Legislation in the UK is primarily concerned with the safe disposal of waste. It was not until the introduction of the Landfill Tax in 1996 and the Aggregates Levy in 2002 that concerted effort was made by the UK minerals industry to reduce, reuse or recycle <b>mineral</b> <b>waste.</b> A significant amount of research has been carried out since then to identify new uses for <b>mineral</b> <b>waste,</b> much of it funded in the 1990 s and 2000 s by the taxes raised.

40|$|An {{industrial}} <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> {{produced in}} the aluminum sulphate industry was selected as a low cost catalyst precursor. This material {{has been active in}} dibenzylether hydroconversion, as a model compound of C-O linkages in coal. Besides, it was used in the hydroconversion of a colombian subbituminous coal. The <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> and a commercial iron oxide (as reference material) were sulfided in order to produce iron sulfide, pyrrhotite type (Fe 1 -xS), which is the active phase in hydroconversion reactions. The solids were characterized by X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Catalytic tests with the model compound and coal were carried out at 5 MPa of H 2, temperatures between 240 °C and 400 °C and reaction times were 0. 5 h or 1 h. The results showed a higher activity of the industrial <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> compared with the reference material in the dibenzylether C-O bond cleavage. These kind of bonds are responsible for asphalthenes and preasphalthenes assembly in the molecular coal structure. In addition, coal conversion in presence of catalysts was 83. 9 %, this value was 1. 8 times higher than conversion without catalyst. Results show the potential of the industrial <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> to be used as catalyst in the hydroconversion of coal due to its good activity and low cost...|$|E

This project aimed to improve the sustainability of mining communities by investigating the use of <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> as a source of construction and industrial minerals. The types of waste found in a range of extractive operations were reviewed. Case studies were carried out in Namibia and Costa Rica including investigations of the properties of the waste, mineral product evaluations, market and economic appraisals and social and environmental impact assessments of local communities.

40|$|AbstractThe early {{hydration}} (up to 24 h) {{of calcium}} aluminate cement (Al 2 O 3 min. 40 %) blended with spent FCC catalyst at two temperatures i. e. 10 ̊C and 25 ̊C was investigated. The calorimetric measurements {{were used to}} study cement pastes with constant ratio of water/binder = 0. 5 (binder = cement + addition) and containing 0, 5 and 25 % mass of <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> as replacement part of cement. In addition the kind of created products using X-ray diffraction method was identified. On the basis of obtained results {{it was found that}} the influence of spent FCC catalyst on early hydration of calcium aluminate cement strictly depends on temperature of hydration process. At the temperature of 25 ̊C this waste aluminosilicate accelerates setting and hardening of cement, but at the temperature of 10 ̊C acts as retarder. These changes are realized by variation of duration of the induction period and the bigger content of FBCC the bigger the effect is regardless of the temperature of hydration.

Although industries can achieve zero emissions of asphalt concrete waste and {{iron and steel}} slag, even under the maximization of their value added, the final disposal of concrete waste and coal ash increases to approximately 25 times and 18 times, respectively, compared to the values for 2005.

40|$|There {{are many}} test methods {{to assess the}} level of the release of heavy metals into the {{environment}} from <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> materials. Leaching methods can be different depending on the leaching time periods, leaching dynamics, sample preparation method or the pH of the elution medium. In Poland, little attention is paid to the research on the relationship between the leaching of particular heavy metals from mineral wastes and changes in environmental conditions, including the pH of the environment. Tests being carried out abroad have started to pay great attention to the pH-dependent impact of the environment and the liquid being in contact with the material on the degree of leaching contaminants from wastes. The solubility of all metals depends on the value of the pH. Authors of the paper will try to prove that Polish methods of waste characterization is incomplete and inconsistent with opinions prevailing in the global literature.

40|$|Two {{samples of}} {{fluidized-bed}} steam reforming (FBSR) <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> form product {{were subjected to}} single-pass flow-through (SPFT) testing. Sample LAW 1123 resulted from pilot-scale FBSR processing with a Hanford Envelope A low-activity waste (LAW) simulant. Sample SBW 1173 resulted from pilot-scale FBSR processing with an Idaho National Laboratory (INL) simulant {{commonly referred to as}} sodium-bearing waste (SBW). The pilot-scale waste forms were made at the Science and Technology Applications Research (STAR) facility in Idaho Falls, Idaho. The durability of the two FBSR waste forms was assessed via the SPFT test in this study. Both samples were multiphase <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> forms, so the SPFT test results provide an overall release rate from the multiple mineral species in each sample and are dependent on the amount of each phase present and the mineralogy of the phases present. SPFT testing was performed at temperatures of 25, 40, 70, and 90 C on LAW 1123, while SBW 1173 was only tested at 70 and 90 C. The 70 and 90 C data were compared to each other and the LAW- 1123 results were compared to previous testing performed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) on a LAW Envelope C (high organic content) waste simulant. The objectives of this study were to obtain forward dissolution rate data for both STAR FBSR bed products (using SPFT tests). Also, a qualitative comparison of the FBSR bed products to a glass waste form (specifically the low-activity reference material (LRM) glass) was performed. For these comparisons, the relative surface areas of the FBSR and glass products had to be measured. Due to the more porous and irregular surface of FBSR bed products, the surface area of the bed products was determined using the Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) measurement method. The surface area of a glass is much smoother and the calculated geometric surface area is typically used for determining dissolution behavior. Presently there are no specifications or standard release rates that the FBSR tested materials have to meet, e. g. the data from the FBSR testing is normally used during subsequent Performance Assessment (PA) calculations. Since a PA calculation is not part of this study, the LAW and SBW steam reforming samples were compared to each other, to previous LAW FBSR SPFT results, and to the results from the LRM reference glass. The experimental durability data generated from this study suggests that an FBSR <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> form product would be an adequate alternative form to borosilicate glass. The tested FBSR <b>mineral</b> <b>waste</b> forms showed normalized release rates for matrix elements such as Si to be more than 200 X slower than the LRM glass.

The first application of this process will be to treat spent fuel alloys from the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II.

The third product stream (i. e., the metal waste stream) {{is the subject of this}} paper. The metal waste stream contains components of the chopped spent fuel that are unaffected by the electrorefining process because of their electrochemically ``noble`` nature; this includes the cladding hulls, noble metal fission products (NMFP), and, in specific cases, zirconium from metal fuel alloys. The selected method for the consolidation and stabilization of the metal waste stream is melting and casting into a uniform, corrosion-resistant alloy. The waste form casting process will be carried out in a controlled-atmosphere furnace at high temperatures with a molten salt flux. Spent fuels with both stainless steel and Zircaloy cladding are being evaluated for treatment; thus, stainless steel-rich and Zircaloy-rich waste forms are being developed.
