40|$|Thesis (DTech. {{degree in}} the Business School) [...] Tshwane University of Technology, 2007. This {{dissertation}} seeks to establish whether <b>microlenders</b> in South Africa aimed at the rural poor {{with the purpose of}} poverty alleviation are or can be self-reliant, self-sufficient and ultimately self-sustaining. This question arose because typical micro finance clients are low-income persons that {{do not have access to}} formal financial institutions. Access to conventional formal financial institutions, for many reasons, is inversely related to income: the poorer you are, the less likely that you have access. On the other hand, the chances are that, the poorer you are, the more expensive or onerous informal financial arrangements (Sapovadia, n. d). A lot of studies have been carried out in other countries, especially developing countries on other similar development <b>microlenders</b> such as the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh that have successfully managed to extend credit to the poor by embarking on alternative or rather unorthodox methods, such as group-lendingthat are not used by formal financial institutions such as commercial banks. Since the poor borrow relatively small amounts that may not even cover all transaction costs, these methods are aimed at among others reaching a huge number of poor people simultaneously to ensure that at least all transaction costs are covered. South African and other development <b>microlenders</b> in the world have attempted to replicate this methodology of lending without the same level of success. The South African situation is further complicated by the South Africa’s economy, which is unique to economies of other developing countries. South Africa has one of the world’s worst income inequalities that have resulted in a dual economy comprising of a first world and third world economies in one country. However donor funding is extended to South African <b>microlenders</b> with basically the same requirements especially with regard to the expectation that the <b>microlenders</b> must attain or promise to be self-sufficient within a certain or specific period in time. “Donors, governments, and many analysts regard sustainability as the benchmark of microfinance institutions’ (MFIs) performance” (Baumann, 2004). This study used requirements by donors as a yardstick to measure the sustainability of development <b>microlenders</b> in South Africa to establish if the alternative method of microlending has yielded the desired results. These results were also critically compared to the <b>microlenders</b> in developing countries to establish specific parallels and contrasts that might be brought about by the South Africa’s unique situation. Data relating to specifically operational and financial self-sufficiency was collected from South African <b>microlenders</b> who are lending for poverty alleviation purposes. This data was analysed to establish whether such organisation are selfsufficient or not. Findings indicated that <b>microlenders</b> in South African in spite of using alternative methods to credit granting such as group lending to exploit social capital that exist in poor communities, most of them are neither self-sufficient or self-sustainable. Further to this it was established that the South African situation does not allow for a direct comparison to <b>microlenders</b> in other developing countries because of South Africa’s dual economy...|$|R

United Prosperity claims this provides both greater leverage and allows the micro-entrepreneur to develop a credit history with their local bank for future loans. In 2009, the US-based nonprofit Zidisha became the first peer-to-peer microlending platform to link lenders and borrowers directly across international borders without local intermediaries.

50|$|Due to the {{unbalanced}} {{emphasis on}} credit {{at the expense}} of microsavings, as well as a desire to link Western investors to the sector, peer-to-peer platforms have developed to expand the availability of microcredit through individual lenders in the developed world.

40|$|We {{worked with}} two <b>microlenders</b> to test impacts of {{randomly}} assigned reminders for loan repayments in the “text messaging {{capital of the}} world”. Messages only improve repayment when they include the loan officer’s name. This effect holds for clients serviced by the loan officer previously but not for first-time borrowers.

5000|$|Microcredit {{organizations}} were initially created as {{alternatives to the}} [...] "loan-sharks" [...] known {{to take advantage of}} clients. Indeed, many <b>microlenders</b> began as non-profit organizations and operated with government funds or private subsidies. By the 1980s, however the [...] "financial systems approach," [...] influenced by neoliberalism and propagated by the Harvard Institute for International Development, became the dominant ideology among microcredit organizations. The commercialization of microcredit officially began in 1984 with the formation of Unit Desa (BRI-UD) within the Bank Rakyat Indonesia. Unit Desa offered ‘kupedes’ microloans based on market interest rates.|$|R
40|$|Policymakers often {{prescribe}} that microfinance institutions increase {{interest rates}} to eliminate reliance on subsidies.

We test the assumption of price inelastic demand using randomized trials conducted by a consumer lender in South Africa. The demand curves are downward-sloping, and steep for price increases relative to the lender’s standard rates. We also find that loan size is far more responsive to changes in loan maturity than to changes in interest rates, {{which is consistent with}} binding liquidity constraints. microfinance...|$|R

Through group lending, situations of adverse selection and moral hazard due to asymmetric information are better managed. [...] "Social collateral" [...] replaces asset collateral (which is lacking in the poorer segments of society). Such a system works because India is still a highly community-centric society. The concept of honour and respect within society is deeply rooted in Indian culture and willful default invites condescending glances, humiliation and even ostracism. In Nov 2015,SKS Microfinance Ltd has cut interest rates by one percentage point to 19.75% on the loans it offers to low-income women borrowers, making it the sole Indian <b>microlender</b> to offer loans at a rate below 20%.The move came after Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided to double the borrower limit for microfinance loans for less than 24 months.Lower interest rates can attract more borrowers in an increasingly competitive market.

If lenders set interest rates to cover the high per-dollar costs of small loans, then they were accused of usury, but if they set lower rates, then they lost money. Microfinance has been defined by new ways to cut the cost of judging the credit risk of the self-employed poor. For example, group lenders tap the knowledge of risk held as a sunk cost by neighbors of a potential borrower.

40|$|Due {{to growing}} competition, over-indebtedness, and {{economic}} crises, microfinance institutions have {{to pursue their}} social and financial objectives in an increasingly constrained environment. Developing powerful risk management tools becomes more than ever crucial to survive. Therefore this paper analyzes whether microfinance institutions can benefit from credit scoring, which has been successfully adopted in retail banking. An extensive literature overview is provided, indicating a lack of quantitative evidence, in particular for markets in Eastern Europe-Central Asia and the Middle East-Northern Africa. Two logistic regression-based scoring models are developed using data from a Bosnia–Herzegovinian <b>microlender.</b> The models are assessed in terms of stability, readability, and discriminatory power, indicating that credit scoring is not yet able to fully replace the human-intensive microfinance credit process. However, it is recommendable to introduce credit scoring as a refinement tool in the lending process, in order to combine both statistical and human best practices. Moreover, a <b>microlender</b> staff can learn from credit scoring models to validate or contrast practical intuition...|$|E

40|$|Interest {{rates are}} a topical {{subject in the}} micro lending {{industry}} in South Africa. The micro lending industry {{has been accused of}} charging usurious interest and exploitating the consumers. This has led to the Department of Trade and Industry passing a Usury Act with an aim of protecting the consumers. The Act imposes interest rate ceilings on loan finance provided by money lending institutions. These ceilings are proposed to be linked to the prime rate. Given this, it is not possible for micro lenders to charge full-cost recovery interest rates. This paper tries to highlight the effects of interest rate ceilings on the micro finance market. It argues that the biggest cost component of <b>microlenders</b> is administration costs and not the cost of capital, thus linking ceilings to the prime rate is illogic. Financial Economics,...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{adopts a}} unique {{approach}} to understanding microfinance in the United States. First, it introduces microfinance {{as a global}} movement with beginnings in Bangladesh, successes in low income countries, and difficulties in high income countries, particularly the United States.

Third, it reports new findings from a survey of American <b>microlenders</b> on Kiva that demonstrate their attitudes towards poverty, the poor, poverty relief programs, and their overall support for microfinance in the United States. In this way, the difficulties and promise of microfinance in the United States are {{explained in terms of}} the attitudes of potential lenders.
