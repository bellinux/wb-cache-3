50|$|The Jesuits {{established}} Mandaue in 1638 as {{a mission}} {{after they had}} acquired lands {{in the area for}} the Colegio de San Ildefonso. They exchanged Mandaue for Parian in Cebu City and assigned a lay brother as administrator of the Mandaue estate. The mission did not seem to have a priest permanently assigned to it, because it was not around 1724 when the Jesuit catalogues specify that a Jesuit was posted at Mandaue and that his responsibility extended to Talibon and Inabanga in Bohol. Thus, for more than a century, Mandaue may have been served by Jesuits of the Colegio who took turns in attending to the spiritual needs of the people. Although the Jesuits did build a church in Mandaue in honor of the fatherhood and protection of St. Joseph, a 1789 report describes the church as “sufficiently deteriorated.” Augustinian writers Felipe Bravo and Manuel Buzeta described the structure as mediana fabrica or <b>mixed</b> <b>fabric.</b> When the Jesuits were expelled in 1768, the administration of Mandaue was handled by the Recollects until 1898.|$|E
5000|$|Until the mid {{eighteenth century}} the {{agricultural}} workers on Briercliffe would supplement their income {{by having a}} wooden handloom at home where they would weave coarse woollen and <b>mixed</b> <b>fabric</b> cloth. Between 1770 and 1820, the huge increase in the availability of cheap machine spun cotton caused many families to leave {{the land and the}} whole family would start to weave cotton. It was their main source of income. In 1830, there were 171 Briercliffe families running 606 looms. This involved 968 persons: the population of the parish had expanded from 956 to 1755. Most worked in the existing farmhouses or the newly built weavers' cottages with the loom shop above the living space. These were in Haggate, Lane Bottom and Holt Hill. Country weavers were paid by piece-rate and were vulnerable to the varying market conditions, and unlike the weavers in towns who formed combinations to organise collective industrial action, they accepted the hardship. During the final boom years of the 1820s, the spinning mill owners used the increased profits to invest in power looms which were installed in weaving sheds in or alongside the steam driven spinning mills. [...] The 1830s were a time of hardship, and the population declined to 1498. The other employment was in the stone quarries. In Lane Bottom there was 'handloom factory' owned by the Smith family of Hill End, but there and in their cottage loomshops, handloom weavers competed for ever decreasing work in the sections of weaving for which the powerloom had not been adapted. Briercliffe had the labour but did not have available capital switch its economy to factory production.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Silk {{is one of}} the {{valuable}} fibers in textile industry. It is used for delicate applications in many areas such as sarees, suitings, curtains and luxurious interiors. To diversify the properties and usages silk is mixed with polyester and lyocell. The fabric is dyed with natural dyes (kum kum, indigo, barberry) as well as synthetic dyes (reactive dye (H), reactive dye (M) and sulphur dye). This <b>mixed</b> <b>fabric</b> is compared with 100 % silk for some of the basic properties like absorbency, water retention, wicking, water vapour permeability, air permeability, K/S values, colour fastness and antimicrobial property. The silk <b>mixed</b> <b>fabric</b> gives the appreciable results with the 100 % silk fabric...|$|E
50|$|After she {{separated}} from her husband, Porter moved to London in May 1964. Her first job was in interior design, working for Elizabeth Eaton. She opened her first shop, an interior decorating business offering imported cushions, fabrics and hangings called Thea Porter Decorations Ltd, in Soho at 8 Greek Street on 27 July 1966. She realised that rather than just cutting up her imported kaftans to use the fabric for cushion covers, they were fashionable in their own right, and began making up her own in <b>mixed</b> <b>fabrics</b> and antique trimmings.|$|R
60|$|Our {{conclusions}} are, then--that, {{while the}} clothing of children {{should never be}} in such excess as to create oppressive warmth, it should always be sufficient to prevent any general feeling of cold;[6] that, instead of the flimsy cotton, linen, or <b>mixed</b> <b>fabrics</b> commonly used, it should be made of some good non-conductor, such as coarse woollen cloth; {{that it should be}} so strong as to receive little damage from the hard wear and tear which childish sports will give it; and that its colours should be such as will not soon suffer from use and exposure.|$|R

40|$|Resin {{transfer}} molding (RTM) is a closed mold process for making composite materials. It {{has the potential}} to produce parts more cost effectively than hand lay-up or other methods. However, fluid flow tends to be unpredictable and parts the size of a wind turbine blade are difficult to engineer without some predictive method for resin flow. There were five goals of this study. The first was to determine permeabilities for three fabrics commonly used for RTM over a useful range of fiber volume fractions. Next, relations to estimate permeabilities in <b>mixed</b> <b>fabric</b> lay-ups were evaluated. Flow in blade substructures was analyzed and compared to predictions. Flow in a full-scale blade was predicted and substructure results were used to validate the accuracy of a full-scale blade prediction...|$|E
40|$|Nepal’s state-society {{relations}} {{are moving in}} tandem with the change in global conceptual design and claim of Nepalese citizens to share state sovereignty and authority. Nepalese citizens have experienced various nature of state system—patrimonial, extractive-patrimonial, constitutional, authoritarian, subsidiary and now fragile. The state fragility is marked by the erosion of its “legitimate monopoly on power,” incapacity to achieve governance goals—national security, law and order, voice, civic articipation, service delivery and cope with post-state challenges. Endogenous post-conflict state building process in Nepal requires addressing the crisis of power, a legitimate social contract, a workable constitution, structural reforms to address the root causes of conflict and democratic peace. The support of international community to the Nepalese citizens’ aspiration for a constitutional state is necessary to maintain a golden rule of politics: the instinct of society for freedom and the imperative of state for public order to keep <b>mixed</b> <b>fabric</b> of Nepalese society together and attain civil peace, social justice and changing ideals of democracy rooted into constitutional and cosmological rights...|$|E
