40|$|Over {{the next}} several years, crop prices are {{projected}} to be below to slightly above commodity loan rates. As a result, <b>marketing</b> <b>loan</b> benefits to farmers, {{in the form of}} loan deficiency payments and <b>marketing</b> <b>loan</b> gains from the commodity loan program, are likely to continue to be sizeable. The level of realized per-unit revenues facilitated by <b>marketing</b> <b>loans</b> exceeds commodity loan rates, thereby raising expected net returns to farmers. Model simulations show that the loan program can raise total acreage planted to major field crops, generally increasing levels of domestic use and exports while lowering crop prices. Cross-commodity effects of supply response to relative returns (including <b>marketing</b> <b>loan</b> benefits), however, result in acreage shifts among competing crops, which can lead to reductions in plantings of some crops in some years. Most impacts occur in the years when there are <b>marketing</b> <b>loan</b> benefits, with little effect in subsequent years when prices rise high enough to eliminate <b>marketing</b> <b>loan</b> benefits.

In 2002-03, expenditure on major subsidises increased to 11.9 per cent from 10.0 per cent in 2001-02. With {{the dismantling of the}} administered price mechanism for petroleum products from 1 April 2002, subsidies in respect of LPG and kerosene distributed through the Public Distribution System are now explicitly reflected in the budget. This partially explains the spurt of 35.3 per cent in the expenditure on major subsidies in 2002-03. The spurt in major subsidies in 2002-03 was also because of an increase in food subsidy by Rs. 66.77 billion necessitated by the widespread drought in the country. Some of the major initiatives taken so far to rationalise the budgetary subsidies include targeted approach to food subsidy (BPL families) under Public Distribution System, allowing Food Corporation of India (FCI) to access <b>market</b> <b>loans</b> carrying lower interest rates, encouraging private trade in food grains, liquidating excess food grain stocks, replacing unit based retention price scheme with a group based scheme in the case of fertiliser subsidies and proposed phasing out of subsidies on PDS kerosene and LPG.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Under the Department of Agriculture's (USDA) <b>Marketing</b> Assistance <b>Loan</b> Program, the federal government accepts harvested crops as collateral for interest-bearing <b>loans</b> (<b>marketing</b> assistance <b>loans)</b> that are typically due in nine months. When market prices drop below the loan rate (the loan price per pound or bushel), the government allows farmers to repay the loan at a lower rate and retain ownership of their commodity for eventual sale. The difference between the loan rate and the lower repayment rate is called the "marketing loan gain. " Conversely, farmers {{who do not have}} <b>marketing</b> assistance <b>loans</b> can also receive a benefit when prices are low called a "loan deficiency payment. " The loan deficiency payment is equal to the <b>marketing</b> <b>loan</b> gain that the farmer would have received if he or she had a loan. Farmers may choose to obtain either a <b>marketing</b> <b>loan</b> gain or a loan deficiency payment [...] both of which are known as the <b>marketing</b> <b>loan</b> benefit. The increase in the payment limit and the availability of commodity certificates had only modest effects on the $ 15 billion in <b>marketing</b> assistance <b>loan</b> payments provided for crop year 1999 and for crop year 2000 through May 2001. Because of the increase in the payment limit, total payments over the two-year period were 1. 9 percent more than they would have been under the previous limit, or an additional $ 261. 1 million. Most farmers did not use commodity certificates to receive gains more than the payment limit, but a small number of farmers did benefit from the program.
