Originally it was loosely based on the {{character}} in the Beatles’ [...] "Lady Madonna." [...] In {{order to make the}} character more interesting, he decided to make her abnormal, and he thought of a young next door neighbor girl he had known who had seemed [...] "socially retarded." [...] O'Day said he also thought of his own childhood, since as an only child who was often ill, many of his days were spent in bed with a radio to keep him company. He named the character Angie, possibly inspired by the Rolling Stones' song [...] "Angie". Originally the character was portrayed as mentally [...] "slow," [...] but while writing the song, O'Day showed it to his therapist, who pointed out that the character's reactions in the song were not those of a <b>mentally</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>person,</b> so O'Day changed the lyric from [...] "slow" [...] to [...] "touched," [...] and the character's image changed from being mentally disabled to being [...] "crazy." [...] This expanded to her living in a dream world of lovers, inspired by the songs on her radio. When a [...] "neighbor boy with evil on his mind" [...] tries to enter her room {{to take advantage of the}} girl, he is instead drawn into her reality, with weird and unexpected consequences. The intent was to show that the Angie character had more power than he or the listener expected; she shrank him down into her radio, where he remained as her slave whenever she desired him to come out.|$|E

Social workers are active participants in integration processes of mentally disabled people. What role does the social worker play in the integration process? In what items and how can he assist the <b>mentally</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>person</b> in accomplishing his/her social role in corresponding and worthy way? What tools and skills does he need for it? The dissertation thesis tries to work with those questions and to discuss them in more details. An attempt is made to outline theoretic and practical grounds and possibilities for activities of the social worker {{in the process of}} integration of mentally disabled people into the common society. Motivated by an effort to understand activities of the social worker comprehensibly and unambiguously, a concept of three-level periodic operation was defined as ``Identification { [...] } Support { [...] } Opportunity``. The goal of the research is to form an evaluation scale (of the ``Identification`` tool) that could help the social worker in identification of substantial handicaps but also in recognition of advantages of mentally disabled individuals, and to plan focusing of provided social services on individual and effective incorporation of a <b>mentally</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>person</b> into his/her common life or to remove obstacles hindering from his/her incorporation.

Results showed that the effects of IC on attitudes were moderated by the habitual use of imagery: IC enhanced attitudes only for participants with higher levels of habitual imagery use; for participants with lower levels of imagery use, IC reduced attitudes through the mediation of reduced empathy. Thus, the habitual use of mental imagery is necessary for the success of IC in ameliorating attitudes toward a highly stigmatized outgroup, with whom simulating positive interactions may require high imagination abilities...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{provides}} a qualitative analysis of an autobiographical play based on journals {{written by a}} mentally challenged woman. The analysis is founded on authentic personal experience, the script of the play and a video recording of its performance. The empirical section is preceded by a theoretical introduction focused on mental disability in relation to theatre. The empirical section begins with the question: What can we learn about a <b>mentally</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>person</b> through theatre? The analytical process consists of three levels: a content analysis of the performance, {{an analysis of the}} author's perspective and the viewpoint of an implied spectator. The analysis shows that the story contains common autobiographical topics and the author barely reflects her disability. The creative perspective consists of the process of adapting the story into a play. Theatre also plays a therapeutic role and raises awareness. There is an imaginary window on the boundary between the stage and the audience, one that the author opens from within and the viewer from without. During the course of the play, the implied spectator becomes confronted with their prejudice and an accumulation of ambivalent feelings. This process ends in a catharsis and a genuine encounter with the actor's world and her spontaneity. KEY WORDS [...] ...|$|E
40|$|An {{estimated}} 2. 8 million {{adults in}} the United States suffer from psychiatric illness that has persisted or is likely to persist over time (National Institute of Mental Health, 1989). Many of these adults who suffer from mental illness are served by the community mental health system. Although case management has emerged as an important service delivery model in community mental health, there exists a very high incidence of staff turnover. Champney (1989) reports an annual turnover rate of 40 % to 60 % among case managers who work in community mental health centers {{in the state of}} Ohio. Fee (1991) has found an annual turnover rate among case managers of about 30 % at one large inner-city community mental health center, at which he is the di rector. There are a number of serious consequences of high turnover among case managers. As Fee (1991) suggests, it takes about six months for many severely mentally disabled persons to form a meaningful and trusting relationship with a case manager. Because this bonding between a severely mentally disabled client and his or her case manager is so critical, Fee maintains that the frequent turnover of case managers is disastrous in terms of effectiveness of service. Fee (1991) also asserts that dissolving this relationship can sometimes have serious results for a person who is severely mentally disabled, the most extreme result being when the severely <b>mentally</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>person</b> deals with the loss by committing suicide. It is also expensive to train new case managers, costly $ 6, 000 to $ 7, 000, including time to post a position, interview prospective case managers, place newspaper advertisements, and provide orientation and training to the new employee (Fee, 1991).

40|$|During the {{research}} an {{attempt was made}} to gain an understanding of the perceived value of work in psychosocial rehabilitation with the Sate patient at Komani Hospital. The respondents' motivation to work and what they gain from working, was investigated, as well as the experience of the nonworking respondents and their motivation not to work. To achieve this, ten respondents who were working and ten respondents who were not working, were interviewed. This study involves {{only a limited number of}} State patients at Komani Hospital and therefore findings cannot be generalised and also because the study was done at one Hospital only. A literature study was undertaken during which it was evident that work as part of vocational rehabilitation contributed to the well being of the <b>mentally</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>person.</b> It was also stated in the literature that the disabled person must be actively involved in his/her own rehabilitation planning and that the person must make conscious decisions to move away from the "sick" role and participate in his/her rehabilitation process. Interview schedules were developed. Response received from the twenty participants was analysed. The overall findings of the study showed that the majority of respondents who were working, were motivated by money. The fact that the respondents work from Hospital and therefore disrupt the Hospital routine, work with abled co-workers and feeling needed by the factory where they are employed. also emphasised the respondents' motivation to keep on working. The findings of the study with the non-working group showed that some respondents want to work, but there are not enough work opportunities available in and from Hospital. The non-working respondents are not interested in working at the occupational therapy department because the pay patients get for work done at the department is too little, and therefore they reject the work there. Some respondents do not want to work. whether work is available or not. The non-working group is largely dependent on staff and co-patients for an income, or tobacco. The predominant activity of the non-working group of respondents during the day, as well as that of the majority of the working group respondents during weekends was sleeping, talking to friends, and smoking. The research findings, conclusions and recommendations could contribute to a better understanding of patients and the value of work for the patient in a Psychiatric Hospital...|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} attitudes and conceptions of staff who work with <b>mentally</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>persons,</b> {{concerning}} normalization and gender. Six qualitative interviews with such professionals were performed and subsequently analyzed. Since the method {{of this study is}} qualitative, no claim of generalizability is made. The interview material has been categorized into themes by means of coding. The result of the study is presented according to those themes. Important theoretical concepts are normalization, gender and intersectionality. The result showed that the staff claims that there are common views about the actual and ideal characteristics of women and men in society. However, they state that those views play no part in the professional care they and their colleagues give to <b>mentally</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>persons.</b> Nevertheless, their accounts of concrete professional situations show that gender stereotypes do influence important decisions about caretaker´s lives. In the concrete caregiving context, normalization as accessibility to the standards of society turn out to be difficult to separate from normalization as behavior modification, due to the caretaker´s dependency on the caregiver. The staff, which is predominantly female, has considerable power to monitor the lives of both male and female caretakers. Hence, women are not always subordinated to men...|$|R
