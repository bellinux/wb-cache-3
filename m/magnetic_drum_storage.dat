5|$|Kilburn {{anticipated}} {{a return}} to Malvern but Williams persuaded him to stay {{to work on the}} university's collaborative project developing the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercial computer. Max Newman withdrew from the project, believing that the development of computers required engineers and not mathematicians at this point, but Williams preferred to return to electrotechnics, leaving Kilburn in charge. He was assisted by Alan Turing, who arrived at Manchester in 1948. The Mark I incorporated innovations such as index registers, and combined CRTs with <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>storage.</b> Nine Mark I computers were sold by between 1951 and 1957.|$|E

50|$|The Processor is an {{independent}} CPU (with a different instruction set from the Computers) and provides control for 12 to 24 <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>storage</b> units, four to forty UNISERVO II tape drives, two Electronic page recorders, one or two high-speed printers, and a high-speed punched card reader.|$|E
5000|$|FASTRAND was a <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> mass <b>storage</b> system {{built by}} Sperry Rand Corporation (later Sperry Univac) for their UNIVAC 1100 series and 490/494 series computers. A FASTRAND {{subsystem}} consisted {{of one or}} two Control Units and up to eight FASTRAND units. A dual-access FASTRAND subsystem included two complete control units, and provided parallel data paths that allowed simultaneous operations on any two FASTRAND units in the subsystem. Each control unit interfaced to one (optionally two) 1100 Series (36-bit), or 490 Series (30-bit), parallel I/O channels.|$|R
50|$|The Mark I was {{followed}} by the Harvard Mark II (1947 or 1948), Mark III/ADEC (September 1949), and Harvard Mark IV (1952) - all the work of Aiken. The Mark II was an improvement over the Mark I, although it still was based on electromechanical relays. The Mark III used mostly electronic components—vacuum tubes and crystal diodes—but also included mechanical components: rotating <b>magnetic</b> <b>drums</b> for <b>storage,</b> plus relays for transferring data between drums. The Mark IV was all-electronic, replacing the remaining mechanical components with magnetic core memory. The Mark II and Mark III were delivered to the US Navy base at Dahlgren, Virginia. The Mark IV was built for the US Air Force, but it stayed at Harvard.|$|R
5000|$|For {{mass storage}} {{there was a}} drum memory {{available}} {{as well as a}} magnetic tape memory. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> had a <b>storage</b> capacity of 17664 Z25 words. The transmission speed was 6900 words per second. The magnetic tape memory had a capacity of 1 million Z25 words and a transmission speed of approximately 33000 Z25 words per second. In- and output was through punched tape and punched cards; it was also possible to print to a teleprinter.|$|R
5000|$|The UNIVAC 494 was a 30-bit word {{machine and}} {{successor}} to the UNIVAC 490/492 with faster CPU and 131K (later 262K) core memory. Up to 24 I/O channels were available and the system was usually shipped with UNIVAC FH880 or UNIVAC FH432 or FH1782 <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>storage.</b> Basic operating system was OMEGA (successor to REX for the 490) although custom operating systems were also used (e.g. CONTORTS for airline reservations).|$|E

50|$|BESM-1, {{originally}} {{referred to}} as simply the BESM or BESM AN ("BESM Akademii Nauk", BESM of the Academy of Sciences), was completed in 1952. Only one BESM-1 machine was built. The machine used approximately 5,000 vacuum tubes. At the time of completion, it was the fastest computer in Europe. The floating-point numbers were represented as 39-bit words: 32 bits for the numeric part, one bit for sign, and 1 + 5 bits for the exponent. It was capable of representing numbers in the range 10&minus;9 - 1010. BESM-1 had 1024 words of read/write memory using ferrite cores, and 1024 words of read-only memory based on semiconducting diodes. It also had external storage: four magnetic tape units of 30,000 words each, and fast <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>storage</b> with a capacity of 5120 words and an access rate of 800 words/second. The computer was capable of performing 8-10 KFlops. The energy consumption was approximately 30 kW, not accounting for the cooling systems.|$|E
5000|$|The DEUCE had 1450 {{thermionic}} valves, {{and used}} mercury delay lines for its main memory; {{each of the}} 12 delay lines could store 32 instructions or data words of 32 bits. It adopted the then high 1 megahertz clock rate of the Pilot ACE. Input-output was via Hollerith 80-column punch-card equipment. The reader read cards {{at the rate of}} 200 per minute, while the card punch rate was 100 cards per minute. The DEUCE also had an 8192-word <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> for main <b>storage.</b> To access any of the 256 tracks of 32 words, the drum had one group of 16 read and one group of 16 write heads, each group on independent moveable arms, each capable of moving to one of 16 positions. Access time was 15 milliseconds if the heads were already in position; an additional 35 milliseconds was required if the heads had to be moved. There was no rotational delay incurred when reading from and writing to drum. Data was transferred between drum and one of the 32-word delay lines.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>drums</b> were {{developed}} for the US Navy during WW II with the work continuing at Engineering Research Associates (ERA) in 1946 and 1947. [...] An experimental study was completed at ERA and reported to the Navy on June 19, 1947. [...] Other early <b>drum</b> <b>storage</b> device development occurred at Birkbeck College (University of London), Harvard University, IBM and the University of Manchester. [...] An ERA drum was the internal memory for the Atlas 1 computer delivered to the US Navy in October 1950. [...] Thru mergers ERA became a division of UNIVAC shipping the Series 1100 drum {{as a part of}} the UNIVAC File Computer in 1956; each drum stored 180,000 characters.|$|R
50|$|The ICT 1300 was {{identical}} to the 1301 in every way except that its card reader was limited to 300 cards per minute and its line printer was limited to 300 lines per minute. It tended to be sold with less core <b>storage</b> and <b>drum</b> <b>storage</b> and without <b>magnetic</b> tape. A <b>drum</b> with {{only a quarter of}} the read/write heads fitted was commonly used, giving 3,000 words of 48 bits as backing storage.|$|R
50|$|Quotron’s success {{attracted}} the attention of Robert S. Sinn, who observed its disadvantages: it could only give a last price. The opening price, high and low for the day, and share volume were not available. His system received the ticker transmissions from the various stock and commodity exchanges. These were then automatically interpreted by a hard wired digital computer updating a drum memory with the last sale prices {{and at the same time}} computing and updating highs and lows and total volume for each stock. As these items were updated a data packet would be generated for transmission by AT&T Dataphone at 1000 bits/second to identical <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> <b>storage</b> devices in each major city in the United States. These slave drum memory units located in the metropolitan centers in the US could then be accessed by desk units in local stock brokerage offices again using Dataphone transmission. The desk units would set up the ticker symbol code for the desired stock by mechanical means actuating micro switches. The local control box would continuously interrogate each desk unit in sequence and send a request data packet by Dataphone to the local drum memory which would then send return data packets back to the local brokerage office. Each packet both for request and answer would contain the request stock alphabetic symbols plus a desk unit identifier. Because the desk units set up the requested stock code statically the desk unit would automatically update the stock price, volume, and highs and lows without any operator intervention because the control unit could complete the interrogation of all desk units in the office in about every one or two seconds, This is the first use of data packet transmission with the sender’s identification imbedded in the data packet in order to avoid switching- a forerunner of the internet? There was no switching in the entire system; all was done with data packets containing sender identifiers.|$|E
