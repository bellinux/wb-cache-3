5|$|In 2016, {{three new}} major <b>metabolites</b> of bupropion, all formed {{exclusively}} by CYP2C19, were identified. These include 4'-OH-bupropion, erythro-4'-OH-hydrobupropion and threo-4'-OH-hydrobupropion, and represent 24% of {{a dose of}} bupropion excreted in urine. For comparison, bupropion and its three previously known primary <b>metabolites,</b> hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion represent 23% of a dose of bupropion excreted in urine.|$|E
5|$|In about 90% {{of cases}} of neuroblastoma, {{elevated}} levels of catecholamines or their <b>metabolites</b> {{are found in the}} urine or blood. Catecholamines and their <b>metabolites</b> include dopamine, homovanillic acid (HVA), and/or vanillylmandelic acid (VMA).|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of chemical defences in plants {{is linked to}} the emergence of chemical substances that are not involved in the essential photosynthetic and metabolic activities. These substances, secondary <b>metabolites,</b> are organic compounds that are not directly involved in the normal growth, development or reproduction of organisms, and often produced as by-products during the synthesis of primary metabolic products. Although these secondary <b>metabolites</b> have been thought {{to play a major role}} in defenses against herbivores, a meta-analysis of recent relevant studies has suggested that they have either a more minimal (when compared to other non-secondary <b>metabolites,</b> such as primary chemistry and physiology) or more complex involvement in defense.|$|E
50|$|Drugs can undergo {{one of four}} {{potential}} biotransformations: Active Drug to Inactive <b>Metabolite,</b> Active Drug to Active <b>Metabolite,</b> Inactive Drug to Active <b>Metabolite,</b> Active Drug to Toxic <b>Metabolite</b> (biotoxification).|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{contribution}} of an active <b>metabolite</b> to the overall pharmacological response following drug administration {{it is necessary to}} characterise the <b>metabolite</b> concentration-time profile. The influence of route of drug administration on <b>metabolite</b> kinetics has been investigated by computer simulation. Comparisons between simulated profiles and published concentration-time data have been carried out. A route dependence in <b>metabolite</b> concentration-time curves is readily apparent provided the <b>metabolite</b> kinetics are formation rate limited and the hepatic clearance of drug is greater than 25 l/h (medium to highly cleared). Oral drug administration produces a triphasic <b>metabolite</b> concentration-time profile whereas only two phases are discernable after intravenous drug administration. The magnitude of the difference in maximum <b>metabolite</b> concentration is directly proportional to the hepatic clearance of drug due to first-pass <b>metabolite</b> production. The route dependence {{in the shape of the}} <b>metabolite</b> concentration-time curves is most dramatic when the absorption and distribution of drug and the elimination of <b>metabolite</b> is rapid. A reduction in the rate of either of these processes alters the shape of the <b>metabolite</b> concentration-time profile such that the consequence of first-pass <b>metabolite</b> formation may be reduced...|$|R
25|$|Understanding the {{environmental}} {{factors that affect}} <b>metabolite</b> biosynthesis or the ecological role of the <b>metabolite,</b> {{can be used as}} a competitive advantage to maximise <b>metabolite</b> production and total yield. For example, if the ecological role of the secondary target <b>metabolite</b> was to deter predators, mimicking predation via wounding the sponge before harvesting may be an efficient technique to maximise <b>metabolite</b> production.|$|R
5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} can {{be placed}} into one of three groups by its elimination half-life, or {{time it takes for}} the body to eliminate half of the dose. Some benzodiazepines have long-acting active <b>metabolites,</b> such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, which are metabolised into desmethyldiazepam. Desmethyldiazepam has a half-life of 36–200 hours, and flurazepam, with the main active metabolite of desalkylflurazepam, with a half-life of 40–250 hours. These long-acting <b>metabolites</b> are partial agonists.|$|E
5|$|Derivates of cyclopentenones, the {{so-called}} hygrophorones, {{can be obtained}} from the fruit body of H.olivaceoalbus; the fungus produces them as secondary <b>metabolites.</b>|$|E
5|$|Engleromyces sinensis {{is used in}} China in {{traditional}} medicine for its antibiotic and antiinflammatory properties, and is sold in market stalls in Yunnan. Several bioactive <b>metabolites</b> have been isolated and identified from the fungus. It produces engleromycin, a cytochalasin. This compound, which is also made by E.goetzii, has antibiotic and cytotoxic activity. Additional <b>metabolites</b> include the novel compound neoengleromycin, and the previously known cytochalasin D and 19,20-epoxycytochalasin D. Neoengleromycin has an unusual chemical structure featuring a rare amine-substituted hydroxamic acid skeleton.|$|E
30|$|Next, a {{population}} <b>metabolite</b> curve was constructed by averaging the <b>metabolite</b> {{samples of the}} individual rats and fitting the average curve with a single-exponential function. Finally, the population average <b>metabolite</b> curve {{was used for the}} <b>metabolite</b> correction of the individual plasma input functions.|$|R
50|$|O-DSMT is metabolized in {{the liver}} into the active <b>metabolite</b> N,O-didesmethyltramadol via CYP3A4 & CYP2B6. The {{inactive}} tramadol <b>metabolite</b> N-desmethyltramadol is metabolized into the active <b>metabolite</b> N,O-didesmethyltramadol by CYP2D6.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} factors affect sponge <b>metabolite</b> production, with <b>metabolite</b> {{concentration}} varying greatly between neighbouring explants. Localised differences in light intensity and bio-fouling are physical and biological factors {{that have been found}} to significantly affect <b>metabolite</b> biosynthesis in sponges. Changes in environmental factors may alter microbial populations and subsequently affect <b>metabolite</b> biosynthesis.|$|R
5|$|Linezolid is metabolized in the liver, by {{oxidation}} of the morpholine ring, without {{involvement of}} the cytochrome P450 system. This metabolic pathway leads to two major inactive <b>metabolites</b> (which each account for around 45% and 10% of an excreted dose at steady state), one minor metabolite, and several trace <b>metabolites,</b> none of which {{accounts for more than}} 1% of an excreted dose. Clearance of linezolid varies with age and gender; it is fastest in children (which accounts for the shorter half-life), and appears to be 20% lower in women than in men. There is a strong correlation between linezolid clearance and creatinine clearance (CLCR).|$|E
5|$|Mycotoxins are {{secondary}} <b>metabolites</b> (or natural products), {{and research}} has established {{the existence of}} biochemical pathways solely {{for the purpose of}} producing mycotoxins and other natural products in fungi. Mycotoxins may provide fitness benefits in terms of physiological adaptation, competition with other microbes and fungi, and protection from consumption (fungivory). Many fungal secondary <b>metabolites</b> (or derivatives) are used medically, as described under Human Use below.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>metabolites</b> {{isolated}} from different species include dibenzonaphtyridinone alkaloids, prenylated phenols, benzofurans, chromenes, natural rubber (polyisoprene), sterols, and the sugar alcohol volemitol. Among toxic substances, Lactarius turpis contains the mutagenic alkaloid necatorin, {{and the small}} compound cycloprop-2-ene carboxylic acid {{has been identified as}} the toxic agent in Russula subnigricans. Some secondary <b>metabolites</b> showed antibiotic properties in laboratory tests. An ethanolic extract of Russula delica was antibacterial, and a lectin from Russula rosea showed antitumor activity.|$|E
5000|$|... 4-Hydroxyphenylacetone is the parahydroxy analog of phenylacetone, an {{inactive}} <b>metabolite</b> of amphetamine in humans. [...] When {{it occurs}} as a <b>metabolite</b> of amphetamine, it is produced {{directly from the}} inactive <b>metabolite</b> phenylacetone.|$|R
5000|$|M3G, morphine-3-glucuronide an {{inactive}} <b>metabolite</b> {{of morphine}} much as 3-MAM is the less active <b>metabolite</b> of heroin (notably here as morphine {{is an active}} secondary <b>metabolite</b> of heroin itself with 6-Monoacetylmorphine being the intermediate stage) ...|$|R
40|$|Substrate <b>metabolite</b> {{concentrations}} are {{inversely related}} to the in vivo capacity of their converting enzymes. Local <b>metabolite</b> responses represent a passive mechanism to achieve metabolic homeostasis upon perturbations in enzyme capacity. Enzyme capacity and <b>metabolite</b> concentration control the metabolic reaction rate...|$|R
5|$|Plants {{have evolved}} many {{secondary}} <b>metabolites</b> involved in plant defense, which are collectively known as antiherbivory compounds {{and can be}} classified into three sub-groups: nitrogen compounds (including alkaloids, cyanogenic glycosides, glucosinolates and benzoxazinoids), terpenoids, and phenolics.|$|E
5|$|Quantitative {{chemicals}} {{are those that}} are present in high concentration in plants (5 – 40% dry weight) and are equally effective against all specialists and generalist herbivores. Most quantitative <b>metabolites</b> are digestibility reducers that make plant cell walls indigestible to animals. The effects of quantitative <b>metabolites</b> are dosage dependent and the higher these chemicals’ proportion in the herbivore’s diet, the less nutrition the herbivore can gain from ingesting plant tissues. Because they are typically large molecules, these defenses are energetically expensive to produce and maintain, and often take longer to synthesize and transport.|$|E
5|$|Secondary <b>metabolites</b> {{are often}} {{characterized}} as either qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative <b>metabolites</b> {{are defined as}} toxins that interfere with an herbivore’s metabolism, often by blocking specific biochemical reactions. Qualitative chemicals are present in plants in relatively low concentrations (often less than 2% dry weight), and are not dosage dependent. They are usually small, water-soluble molecules, and therefore can be rapidly synthesized, transported and stored with relatively little energy cost to the plant. Qualitative allelochemicals are usually effective against non-adapted specialists and generalist herbivores.|$|E

50|$|Homovanillyl {{alcohol is}} a <b>metabolite</b> of hydroxytyrosol, {{which in turn}} is a <b>metabolite</b> of the {{neurotransmitter}} dopamine.|$|R
50|$|Hydromorphinol is metabolised {{mainly in}} the liver {{in the same fashion}} as many other opioids and is itself a minor active <b>metabolite</b> of 14-Hydroxydihydrocodeine, an uncommonly used opiate (but is {{therefore}} also an active <b>metabolite</b> of a first-order active <b>metabolite</b> of oxycodone).|$|R
5|$|The <b>metabolites,</b> {{as well as}} some unmetabolized alprazolam, are {{filtered}} out by the kidneys and are excreted in the urine.|$|E
5|$|Withdrawal is best {{managed by}} {{transferring}} the physically dependent patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam {{because it has}} the longest half-life {{of all of the}} benzodiazepines, is metabolised into long-acting active <b>metabolites</b> and is available in low-potency tablets, which can be quartered for smaller doses. A further benefit is that it is available in liquid form, which allows for even smaller reductions. Chlordiazepoxide, which also has a long half-life and long-acting active <b>metabolites,</b> can be used as an alternative.|$|E
5|$|A related {{problem for}} aerobic organisms is {{oxidative}} stress. Here, processes including oxidative phosphorylation {{and the formation}} of disulfide bonds during protein folding produce reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. These damaging oxidants are removed by antioxidant <b>metabolites</b> such as glutathione and enzymes such as catalases and peroxidases.|$|E

50|$|Sildenafil {{is mainly}} metabolized by the microsomal {{isozymes}} CYP3A4 with secondary metabolism by CYP2C9. The major active <b>metabolite</b> is N-desmethylsildenafil. The plasma {{level of the}} equivalent homosildenafil <b>metabolite</b> reaches 40% of sildenafil's bioavailability. The N-desmethyl <b>metabolite</b> is further metabolized, with a half-life of 4 hours.|$|R
5|$|Additional {{secondary}} <b>metabolites</b> {{discovered in}} H.eburneus include the ceramide compound named hygrophamide ((2S,3R,4R,2’R)-2-(2’-hydroxy-9’Z-ene-tetracosanoylamino)-octadecane-1,3,4-triol), and the β-carboline alkaloids known as harmane and norharmane. The report of {{discovery of the}} latter two compounds in 2008 represents their first known occurrence in fungal fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam is metabolized in the liver, {{mostly by}} the enzyme {{cytochrome}} P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Two major <b>metabolites</b> are produced: 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam, {{as well as}} an inactive benzophenone. The low concentrations and low potencies of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam indicate that they have little to no contribution to the effects of alprazolam.|$|E
5|$|An {{idea of the}} {{complexity}} of the metabolic networks in cells that contain thousands of different enzymes is given by the figure showing the interactions between just 43 proteins and 40 <b>metabolites</b> to the right: the sequences of genomes provide lists containing anything up to 45,000 genes. However, it is now possible to use this genomic data to reconstruct complete networks of biochemical reactions and produce more holistic mathematical models that may explain and predict their behavior. These models are especially powerful when used to integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data on gene expression from proteomic and DNA microarray studies. Using these techniques, a model of human metabolism has now been produced, which will guide future drug discovery and biochemical research. These models are now used in network analysis, to classify human diseases into groups that share common proteins or <b>metabolites.</b>|$|E

25|$|Ethanol's {{toxicity}} {{is largely}} caused by its primary <b>metabolite,</b> acetaldehyde (systematically ethanal) and secondary <b>metabolite,</b> acetic acid.

30|$|A data {{normalization}} step {{was performed to}} correct variation between instrument inter-day tuning differences. Each compound was corrected in run-day blocks by registering the medians to equal 1.00 and normalizing each data point proportionally. The relative abundance of each <b>metabolite</b> was also normalized by median of the <b>metabolite</b> across the entire dataset (i.e. median-scaled). Median-scaled relative abundance is calculated as: raw abundance of a metabolite/median raw abundance of that <b>metabolite</b> across the entire dataset. Median-scaled relative abundance Z-score was further used {{as a basis for}} metabolic pathway network visualization. Z-scores are expressed as standard deviations from the mean and were calculated using the following formula: z[*]=[*](x- μ)/σ where “x” is median-scaled relative abundance of the <b>metabolite,</b> “μ” is mean of median-scaled relative abundance for the <b>metabolite</b> across three rice bran varieties, and “σ” is the median-scaled relative abundance standard deviation of same <b>metabolite</b> across three varieties.
