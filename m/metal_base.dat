5|$|The {{music of}} folk metal is a diverse {{collection}} with bands pursuing different subgenres of heavy metal music. While bands like Primordial and Finntroll perform black metal, other {{groups such as}} The Lord Weird Slough Feg ply their trade with a more traditional or power <b>metal</b> <b>base.</b> The German-Norwegian group Midnattsol blends the genre with gothic metal. Progressive tendencies can be found among some bands including Elvenking, Lumsk and Týr. Some bands are known to adopt more than one different styles of heavy metal. Orphaned Land combines folk metal with progressive and doom/death metal. The band formed in 1991, also combining Jewish, Arabic, and other West Asian influences while Ensiferum mix folk music {{on top of a}} power and death metal hybrid. A few groups are also known to incorporate the styles of other music genres outside of heavy metal. Examples include the punk rock in the music of Glittertind and the neofolk and post-rock tendencies of Agalloch.|$|E

2500|$|Chassis detail varied {{quite a bit}} in {{different}} models. Though more toy-like in execution, early International pickups had detailed plastic bases with engine, exhaust and suspension details clearly molded. Starting about 1954, though, most bases/chassis were made of metal, which apparently added structural strength for friction motors that started to be popular in many promotionals. For example, the 1955 Bel Air without friction motor had a chassis completely smooth and molded in plastic, while the 1954 Corvette, with [...] "spin-torque motor" [...] (as PMC called it), had a <b>metal</b> <b>base.</b> Though PMC offered no promotionals after 1960, other promotional model makers found the new and harder styrene plastic durable enough to support the motor. Also, plastic bases did not rust over time.|$|E
2500|$|In its {{original}} form, iMac G3 had a gumdrop or egg-shaped look, with a CRT monitor, mainly enclosed by a colored, translucent plastic case, which was refreshed early {{on with a}} sleeker design notable for its slot-loaded optical drive. The second major revision, iMac G4, moved the design to a hemispherical base containing all the main components and an LCD monitor on a freely moving arm attached to it. The third and fourth major revisions, iMac G5 and the Intel iMac respectively, placed all the components immediately behind the display, creating a slim unified design that tilts only {{up and down on}} a simple <b>metal</b> <b>base.</b> The fifth major revision (mid-2007) shared the same form as the previous model, but was thinner and used anodized aluminum and a glass panel over the entire front. The sixth major revision (late 2012) uses a different display unit, omits the SuperDrive, and uses different production techniques from the older unibody versions. This allows it to be thinner at the edge than older models, with an edge thickness of 5.9mm (but the same maximum depth). It also includes a dual microphone setup, and includes solid-state drive (SSD) or hard disk storage, or an Apple Fusion Drive, a hybrid of solid state and hard disk drives. This version of iMac was announced in October 2012, with the [...] version released in November and the [...] version in December; these were refreshed in September 2013, with new Haswell processors, faster graphics, faster and larger SSD options and 802.11ac Wi-Fi cards.|$|E

60|$|The {{civilian}} cuts {{a ridiculous}} figure when he enlarges upon small adventures which may come his way--adventures which the soldier endures in silence {{as part of}} his everyday life. On this occasion, however, the episode was all our own, and had a sporting flavour in it which made it dramatic. I know now the feeling of tense expectation with which the driven grouse whirrs onwards towards the butt. I have been behind the butt before now, and it is only poetic justice that I should see the matter from the other point of view. As we approached Ronchi we could see shrapnel breaking over the road in front of us, but we had not yet realised that it was precisely for vehicles that the Austrians were waiting, and that they had the range marked out to a yard. We went down the road all out at a steady fifty miles an hour. The village was near, and it seemed that we had got past the place of danger. We had in fact just reached it. At this moment there was a noise as if the whole four tyres had gone simultaneously, a most terrific bang in our very ears, merging into a second sound like a reverberating blow upon an enormous gong. As I glanced up I saw three clouds immediately above my head, two of them white and the other of a rusty red. The air was full of flying metal, and the road, as we were told afterwards by an observer, was all churned up by it. The <b>metal</b> <b>base</b> of one of the shells was found plumb {{in the middle of the}} road just where our motor had been. There is no use telling me Austrian gunners can't shoot. I know better.|$|E

40|$|Catalytic {{reforming}} of tarry by-products {{in product}} gases derived from gasification of biomass {{is considered a}} possible alternative to scrubbing processes. Despite {{a large number of}} publications in the last years {{there are still a lot}} of problems to be solved for regarding the long-term application of catalysts in large scale processes. In our project, several different commercially-available and recently-developed catalysts were tested for the reforming of model tar compounds and methane in a simulated producer gas from allothermal biomass gasification in a laboratory scale test rig. Bulk nickel based catalysts showed lower resistance to sulphur poisoning than precious <b>metal</b> <b>based,</b> confirming the common literature. The performance of monolithic precious <b>metal</b> <b>based</b> catalysts is highly dependent on the ratio of different precious metals. Down to 800 °C it is possible to convert a considerable amount of tar components even with high tar load and H 2 S present in the gas mixture. In the final phase of the project, details about the reaction kinetics shall be investigated. Additionally, combinations of nickel and precious <b>metal</b> <b>based</b> catalysts will be tested...|$|R
