5|$|Cheetahs breed {{throughout}} the year; they are induced ovulators. Females become sexually mature at 21 to 22 months of age. Females are polyoestrusthey have an oestrus ("heat") cycle every 12days (this {{can vary from}} 10to 20 days), each oestrus lasting one to three days. A female can give birth again after 17 to 20 months; however, on {{the loss of a}} whole litter mothers can mate again. Urine-marking in males becomes more pronounced when a female in their vicinity comes into oestrus. Males fight among one another to secure access to the female; even males in a coalition may show some aggression toward one another on approaching a female. One male eventually wins dominance over the others. Mating, observed mainly at night, begins with the male approaching the female, who lies down on the ground. No courtship behaviour is observed; the male immediately secures hold of the female's nape and copulation takes place. The pair then ignore each other and part ways. However, they meet and copulate a few more times within the next few days. Polyandrous, females can mate with several males. The <b>mean</b> <b>number</b> of motile sperm in a single ejaculation is nearly 25.3million.|$|E
5|$|Hospice is a {{competitive}} business. In any given service area, {{there may be}} hundreds of different non-profit and commercial providers. Hospices can be small community-based operations, part of regional and national corporations, or part of a hospital or other health system. Data from the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization indicated that in 2008 58.3% of hospice agencies were independent, with 20.8% based in hospitals, 19.7% geared for home health care and 1.3% in conjunction with nursing homes. In 2007, the <b>mean</b> <b>number</b> of patients being treated in hospice facilities {{on any given day}} was 90.2. 79.4% of hospice providers admitted fewer than 500 patients per year. The number of for-profit and non-profit providers has become more balanced as the for-profit sector has grown. In 2007, 47.1% of agencies were for-profit, with 48.6% non-profit. The remaining 4.3% were government-owned providers.|$|E

40|$|We {{compared}} {{growth of}} the recently discovered respiratory pathogen Chlamydia pneumoniae in McCoy, HeLa 229, BHK- 21, and HL cells. When cells were not pretreated with DEAE-dextran, HL cells had significantly higher <b>mean</b> <b>numbers</b> of inclusion-forming units (IFUs) on initial inoculation than the other cell lines. When cells were pretreated with DEAE-dextran, HeLa 229 and HL cells had equivalent <b>mean</b> <b>numbers</b> of IFUs on initial inoculation. HL cells had strikingly higher <b>mean</b> <b>numbers</b> of IFUs in passage than HeLa 229, BHK- 21, or McCoy cells. In addition, HL cells did not require pretreatment with DEAE-dextran and could be used from 2 to 4 days after seeding.

40|$|Subclinical {{abnormality}} of neutrophil {{populations of}} patients suffering from schizophrenia and medicated with antipsychotic drugs was evaluated using cellular immaturity as a criterion. Neutrophil maturity {{of patients and}} controls was compared by determining mean nuclear lobularity in peripheral blood smears. White blood cell and neutrophil counts were made. Subjects were patients medicated with chlorpromazine (n = 17) or clozapine (n = 48). Controls (n = 58) were healthy, non-medicated clinical and academic staff. Determination of <b>mean</b> lobe <b>number</b> involved assessment of 300 neutrophils per individual. For subject and control groups, means and medians of <b>mean</b> lobe <b>numbers</b> and <b>mean</b> white cell and neutrophil counts were determined. Means for each group were compared using the Mann–Whitney U-test; variances using Fratios. <b>Means</b> of lobe <b>numbers</b> of both patient populations were significantly different (p < 0. 0001) compared to controls. Two-thirds of patients had <b>mean</b> lobe <b>numbers</b> outside the control range. Dose–response (<b>mean</b> lobe <b>number)</b> plots were significant for patients medicated with both chlorpromazine and clozapine. White cell and neutrophil counts in patients and controls did not differ significantly. For six patients, <b>mean</b> lobe <b>numbers</b> were obtained before and after medication commenced and all showed lowering of <b>mean</b> lobe <b>number.</b> The <b>mean</b> lobe <b>number</b> of the one patient who subsequently suffered from agranulocytosis was {{at the low end}} of the patient range. Thus, patients medicated with antipsychotic drugs typically have immature neutrophils, but normal white cell and neutrophil numbers. This effect is probably drug-induced. <b>Mean</b> lobe <b>number</b> may predict patients at risk from agranulocytosis...|$|R

Milan's climate is similar to much of Northern Italy's inland plains, with hot, sultry summers and cold, foggy winters. However, the <b>mean</b> <b>number</b> of days with precipitation per year {{is one of the}} lowest in Europe.

25|$|Work by Helen Leach {{shows that}} Māori were using about 36 {{different}} food plants, although many required detoxification and long periods (12–24 hours) of cooking. D. Sutton's research on early Māori fertility found that first pregnancy occurred at about 20 {{years and the}} <b>mean</b> <b>number</b> of births was low, compared with other neolithic societies. The low number of births {{may have been due}} to the very low average life expectancy of 31–32 years. Analysis of skeletons at Wairau Bar showed signs of a hard life, with many having had broken bones that had healed. This suggests that the people ate a balanced diet and enjoyed a supportive community that had the resources to support severely injured family members.|$|E

40|$|The {{population}} structure of #Onchocerca volvulus$ macrofilariae was studied in villages of central Cameroon where onchocerciasis is hyper-endemic. One nodule selected at random {{was removed from}} each of 576 adult males, and examined by histology. The numbers {{of male and female}} worms/nodule, and the status of the female worms (fecund, non-fecund, or dead) were recorded. The observations were analysed to evaluate whether the <b>mean</b> <b>numbers</b> of worms of each category varied in relation to the patient's age, the level of endemicity in his village, the anatomical localization of the nodule, the weight of the nodule, and the total number of palpable nodules harboured by the patient. The results obtained were very similar to those reported from West Africa. The <b>mean</b> <b>numbers</b> of dead female worms/nodule were relatively high in the villages with the lowest levels of endemicity. The <b>mean</b> <b>numbers</b> of fecund females and of live males were significantly higher in the nodules located around the knees.
