5|$|Another {{departure}} from the gameplay of Final Fantasy X is in its world navigation system: players can visit almost every location in Spira from early in the game, transported via the airship Celsius. This is a deviation from the overall Final Fantasy series, where the most efficient <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> is typically not obtained {{until late in the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Different <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> have {{appeared}} through the series. The most common is the airship for long range travel, accompanied by chocobos for travelling short distances, but others include sea and land vessels. Following Final FantasyVII, more modern and futuristic vehicle designs have been included.|$|E

As these have not been shown elsewhere, {{it does not seem}} likely that they are a common <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> in the {{alternate}} universe, but rather that this is a reference to The Prisoner, in which similar mind-games were used against an agent being held prisoner.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} became {{increasingly}} congested further <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> were sought, eventually leading to horse-drawn trolleys. These, in turn, {{were replaced by}} electric trolleys that traveled down the main streets of downtown Newark, including Broad Street, and up Market Street near the courthouse The trolley cars {{did not last long}} as the personal motor vehicle quickly gained popularity and slowly made the trolley system seem like a burden.|$|E
5|$|Cross-country {{skiing is}} a form of skiing where skiers rely on their own {{locomotion}} to move across snow-covered terrain, rather than using ski lifts or other forms of assistance. Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation.</b> Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport.|$|E

Rail service runs from Kumba in the west to Bélabo in the east and north to Ngaoundéré. International airports are located in Douala and Yaoundé, with a third under construction in Maroua. Douala is the country's principal seaport. In the north, the Bénoué River is seasonally navigable from Garoua across into Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|Ox-cart and {{motorcycle}} {{are common}} <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> in Ratanakiri.

40|$|Confronted {{with the}} current {{challenge}} of urban mobility, the bicycle has been presented {{as an alternative to}} individual transportation. Studies on this topic have mainly identified the individual factors involved in the choosing <b>of</b> this <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation,</b> sometimes putting the environmental factors in second plan, and neglecting the person-environment implications of the bicycle use a <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation.</b> This article aimed to identify, through environmental psychology, the barrier and facilitators {{in the use of the}} bicycle among college students in the city of Florianópolis-SC. Eighteen college students (twelve men and eight woman) answered a semistructured interview. The data was organized into two categories of four subcategories each, based on the categorical-content analysis. The results indicated as barriers the Environment factors, social conjuncture, and political and personal factors. Among the facilitators, the time, practicality, motorized system, and personal factors were indicated as main characteristics. The results show a need to comprehend the use of bicycles as a <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> in a contextualized way and as part of a public policy in effect. Furthermore, this study emphasizes the existence of an interpersonal dimension of traffic, which requires from its participants a sharing posture, rather than a competitive one...|$|R

5|$|In 1856, {{the church}} inaugurated {{a system of}} {{handcart}} companies in order to enable poor European emigrants to make the trek more cheaply. Handcarts, two-wheeled carts that were pulled by emigrants instead of draft animals, were sometimes used as an alternate <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> from 1856 to 1860. They were seen as a faster, easier, and cheaper way to bring European converts to Salt Lake City. Almost 3,000 Mormons, with 653 carts and 50 supply wagons, traveling in 10 different companies, made the trip over the trail to Salt Lake City. While {{not the first to}} use handcarts, they were the only group to use them extensively.|$|E
5|$|Public {{transport}} {{is based}} on a fairly dense network of tram and bus routes operated by a municipal company, supplemented by a number of private minibus operators. Local trains connect some of the suburbs. The bulk of the city's historic area {{has been turned into a}} pedestrian zone with rickshaws and horse-drawn carriages; however, the tramlines run within a three-block radius (pictured). The historic <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> in the city can be examined at the Museum of Municipal Engineering in the Kazimierz district, with many old trams, cars and buses.|$|E
5|$|The first European American {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} Chingleclamouche Township in about 1793, {{and the first}} sawmill in Clearfield County began operating in 1805. Settlers initially occupied land along the river and creeks, as these provided a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation.</b> Some settlers would harvest timber and float it downstream once a year to make money for items they could not produce themselves, but by 1820 the first full-time lumbering operations began in the region. The white pine was the most sought after tree, yielding spars for ships and timber for buildings. Hardwoods were also harvested, and eventually hemlocks were cut for their wood and their bark, which contained tannins used in tanning leather.|$|E

Although Prester itself is not a representation of Earth, it features technology reminiscent of nineteenth-century Europe {{at the dawn of}} the Industrial Revolution. Many of its designs were also inspired by Germany's technological advances during the interwar period.|$|E
5|$|Wander's horse, Agro, plays a {{large role}} in the game. In {{addition}} to serving as a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation,</b> fighting from horseback is vital to defeat some of the colossi. There are, however, many environments that cannot be traversed by horse, and colossi often inhabit areas within deep water or beyond large obstacles that must be scaled. Agro cannot travel beyond these, and when separated from Wander by such obstacles, cannot participate in the following battle. Agro is referred to as a male in the English-language version of the game, though director Fumito Ueda said that he saw Wander's horse as female.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the agency, the only <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> were bullock-carts known as jhatkas along with palanquins. The roads {{connecting}} Madras to Calcutta in the north and the kingdom of Travancore in the south served as lines of communication during wars. From the early 20th century onwards, bullock-carts and horses were gradually replaced by bicycles and motor vehicles, while motor buses were the main means of private road transportation. Presidency Transport and the City Motor Service were pioneers, operating buses manufactured by Simpson and Co. as early as 1910. The first organised bus system in Madras city was operated by Madras Tramways Corporation between 1925 and 1928. The 1939 Motor Vehicles Act imposed restrictions on public-owned bus and motor services. Most of the early bus services were operated by private agencies.|$|E
5|$|The Scuppernong had {{remained}} largely undeveloped throughout history. In 1793, {{the town of}} Columbia was built on its banks, as were several boat landings. The Scuppernong is a blackwater river: it water is colored like black tea or coffee. The Scuppernong served as a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> for the early settlers in this region of North Carolina. Since 1989 the Nature Conservancy has sought to protect it in its most natural state. In 2002 the Nature Conservancy offered to donate four tracts of land that they owned along the Scuppernong if the state would purchase three more tracts that became available that same year. The state agreed and in 2004 the area along the river was officially added to the state park system.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of marine}} mammals by the Navy, even in {{accordance}} with the Navy's policy, continues to meet opposition. The Navy's policy says that only positive reinforcement is to be used while training the military dolphins, and that they be cared for {{in accordance with}} accepted standards in animal care. The inevitable stresses involved in training are topics of controversy, as their treatment is unlike the animals' natural lifestyle, especially towards their confined spaces when not training. There is also controversy over the use of muzzles and other inhibitors, which prevent the dolphins from foraging for food while working. The Navy states that this is to prevent them from ingesting harmful objects, but conservation activists say this is done to reinforce the trainers' control over the dolphins, who hand out food rewards. The <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> is also an issue for conservation activists, since they are hauled in dry carriers, and switching tanks and introducing the dolphin to new dolphins is potentially dangerous as they are territorial.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, under vehicle {{surveillance}} and {{the classification of}} the vehicles become an indispensable task that must be achieved for security measures in certain areas such as shopping centers, government buildings, army camps etc. The main challenge to achieve this task is to monitor the under frames <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportations.</b> In this paper, we present a novel solution to achieve this aim. Our solution consists of three main parts: monitoring, detection and classification. In the first part we design a new catadioptric camera {{system in which the}} perspective camera points downwards to the catadioptric mirror mounted to the body of a mobile robot. Thanks to the catadioptric mirror the scenes against the camera optical axis direction can be viewed. In the second part we use speeded up robust features (SURF) in an object recognition algorithm. Fast appearance based mapping algorithm (FAB-MAP) is exploited for the classification <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportations</b> in the third part.
