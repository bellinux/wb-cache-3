25|$|Frazier Moore, Associated Press (May 3, 2001) — Fast-paced and stylish, there's {{no mystery}} why it's so <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> watch. … The series' look is bright and plushly appointed. The music swings like {{a night at}} the Stork Club.|$|E
25|$|I {{think we}} were all pretty naive about what we, what we were achieving—we were having too <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> get kind of caught up. We'd just {{released}} our second album overseas on an independent label; and, spent time in America as an independent act. And that was around about the time where we started our own label, just to, um, release, maybe, release a few, some bands of friends of ours, in bands.|$|E
500|$|In November 2012, Novakovic {{proclaimed that}} Natasha was still herself, despite {{how much she}} had grown. She {{explained}} [...] "It's so <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> playing such a free spirited character. I like that she's matured and thinks a little clearer now that she is older, but I don't think Tash could ever become boring, {{no matter how much}} she matures." ...|$|E
50|$|Toni Redpath {{was born}} in Surfers Paradise, Queensland, Australia, and started ballroom dancing {{at the age of}} 9, after {{accompanying}} a friend to a local dance competition and deciding that it looked like too <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> not <b>to</b> try.|$|R

500|$|Julianne Moore as Julian Taylor. For Julian, Cuarón {{wanted an}} actor who had the [...] "credibility of leadership, intelligence, [...] independence". [...] Moore was cast in June 2005, {{initially}} to play {{the first woman to}} become pregnant in 20 years. [...] "She is just so <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> work with," [...] Cuarón told Cinematical. [...] "She is just pulling the rug out from under your feet all the time. You don't know where to stand, because she is going to make fun of you." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{his eighth}} birthday, Stevens {{received}} a new basketball hoop. [...] "It’s so <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> dream in your driveway," [...] he later remarked. [...] "That’s where {{my friends and}} I hung out. It {{was a lot of}} fun to grow up in that era." [...] When a friend, Brandon Monk, had a basketball court installed in his back yard, Stevens [...] "appeared instantaneously." [...] He was so dedicated to the game that he would bring the unprepared ingredients for grilled cheese sandwiches over to Monk's house, so that he would not waste time waiting for the sandwiches to cook.|$|E
500|$|Anita Gates of The New York Times {{referred}} to Bad Girls Club as [...] "a great argument for bringing back programming with actors". She {{believed that the}} [...] "average emotional age" [...] appeared to be 15, {{in contrast to the}} girls' real ages. She stated that the [...] "unpleasant villains cancel one another out and actually make badness uninteresting", commenting that their behavior might not be [...] "bad enough". Gates concluded by suggesting that Bad Girls Club is the on-location equivalent of The Jerry Springer Show. Kelly West of Cinemablend stated that Bad Girls Club is [...] "so <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> watch".|$|E
6000|$|... "Not <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> {{in talking}} <b>to</b> that horsey fellow. I'm sorry for him, but I can't do {{anything}} to amuse him," [...] objected Thorny, pulling himself up from the sofa with a great yawn.|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{really must}} get me as your adjutant, Terence. I see {{there is very}} <b>much</b> more <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> be got out of your sort of {{fighting}} than there is with the regiment. I am very pleased, now, that I stuck to Portuguese as you advised me; {{though it was a}} great bore, at first." ...|$|R
500|$|Among {{retrospective}} {{assessments of}} the song, Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, writing in their book on the former Beatles' solo careers, admire it as [...] "a hoedown stomper which was as country {{as any of the}} tracks on Beaucoups of Blues". Ian Inglis writes of [...] "Sunshine Life for Me": [...] "The result is a convincing piece of good-time folk-rock that would have been at home on Fairport Convention's groundbreaking album Liege & Lief, which was itself hugely influenced by the spirit of the Band's Music from Big Pink... he impression lingers that the track was as <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> make as it is to hear." ...|$|E
500|$|In her weekly {{blog post}} for TV Guide, actress Kate Flannery {{wrote of the}} producer's cut, [...] "Isn't that cool? I think the Office fans are going to really dig it. I love the Stamford characters. Everyone is so <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> work with." [...] This version {{contained}} two new story lines and other minor additions and changes, including Meredith remembering an agreement {{to have sex with}} a coworker {{on the final day of}} employment, Creed selling electronics and furniture from the office, Andy having a plan in case he gets laid off, and Ryan admitting that Kelly has a strange power over him.|$|E
500|$|The manga's {{critical}} reaction has been mixed. Most critics reached a consensus regarding {{the high quality}} of its art, describing it as [...] "crisp", [...] "solid", and [...] "clean and well done". Other aspects of the series have divided critics' opinions. Manga Life's Michael Aronson praised the enemy designs, while Carlo Santos of Anime News Network (ANN) criticized them, adding the series [...] "is not <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> read, and certainly no fun to look at". Writing for Active Anime, Sandra Scholes found points {{of interest in the}} series' story, and praised its action. Santos said the action [...] "got all the drive and excitement of shōnen action", and [...] Comic Book Bin's Leroy Douresseaux called the series [...] "a mixture of Dragonball Z and Naruto, but filled with even more weirdness".|$|E
5000|$|In {{his review}} in the New York Times, Frank Rich {{described}} Marlowe as [...] "a wholly ridiculous show that is <b>much</b> more <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> sit through than many merely mediocre musicals [...] [...] [...] If Marlowe isn't quite a classic of its kind, that's a matter of size, not content. Tacky-looking and sparsely populated, this show lacks the Titaniclike splendor and expenditure of Broadway's all-time fabulous wrecks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These {{questions}} of religion," [...] said the Frenchman, [...] "they {{are of interest}} to you serious English people, {{but they are not}} so <b>much</b> <b>fun.</b> It seems <b>to</b> me that with this power here {{we might be able to}} have some great experience--hein? Something of which we could talk." ...|$|R
50|$|Maisie flirts with Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley), in a {{relationship}} that intensifies, due to her parents' disapproval. Cain ends the relationship when Maisie has given him enough material to blackmail Mark. Attempting to forget him, Maisie goes on holiday with Natasha but Natasha returns alone, revealing that Maisie is having too <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> in Brazil <b>to</b> come home yet.|$|R
500|$|The {{character}} of Vala was immediately {{popular with the}} Stargate writers, producers and crew. During the filming of [...] "Prometheus Unbound", people on set responded [...] "very well" [...] to the chemistry between Vala and Daniel. Director Andy Mikita called executive producer Robert C. Cooper during the first lunch break {{and told him to}} [...] "hire this gal", and Cooper thought Vala/Black [...] "was absolutely wonderful. The character really worked out." [...] Writer Damian Kindler [...] "really loved" [...] what Black brought to the show, believing that [...] "her character, when used properly, is just absolutely wonderful grist for the mill on SG-1." [...] Stargate writer Martin Gero called Vala [...] "so <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> write, almost too fun. You do kind of get carried away." [...] Michael Shanks repeatedly stated in interviews that Claudia Black revitalized his interest in acting.|$|E
500|$|Of Miguel's {{performances}} in Los Angeles, The Orange County Register editor Daniel Chang commented that he [...] "delivered a classy show {{that was as}} <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> watch {{as it was to}} hear". Chang noted that Miguel [...] "emotes a contagious energy through dramatic facial expressions, fetal-position-like contortions and physical outbursts in time with the music" [...] and complimented his dance moves and the visual sets. [...] Regarding his concert in Houston, Michael D. Clark of the Houston Chronicle said that Miguel [...] "proved, once again, that it isn't necessary to change languages to reach U.S. audiences". He observed that Miguel seemed [...] "determined to balance the upbeat with the overwrought" [...] in contrast to his previous concerts which were dominated by ballads. On the other hand, Clark expressed disappointment that the boleros were sung in medleys which did not allow any of them to stand out.|$|E
500|$|Babe {{frequently}} {{clashes with}} Whitney Carter (McGarty). Whitney correctly believes Babe has concocted Abi's pregnancy and confronts her, but Babe threatens {{to reveal her}} kiss with Mick so Whitney backs down. McGarty enjoyed the rivalry between Babe and Whitney, adding that it is [...] "so <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> deliver all the sly little comments that [...] gives to Babe." [...] The actress praised Badland, branding her [...] "scary" [...] in character {{and said she was}} [...] "a bit frightened" [...] of her. Babe and Whitney clash again when Babe blames her for the Carter family's financial problems and tells her that she has [...] "ruined" [...] Lee's life. Babe is left annoyed when Whitney fights back against Babe. Kilkelly (Digital Spy) questioned whether Babe has [...] "finally met her match" [...] when she battles Whitney. Lindsay (Metro) praised the scene in which Babe blames Whitney for the family's financial problems and said, [...] "we just love it when scheming Aunt Babe gets put in her place".|$|E
2500|$|The Rhino Party also {{declared}} that, {{should they}} somehow actually win an election, they would immediately dissolve and force a second election: [...] "We Rhinos think that elections are so <b>much</b> <b>fun,</b> we want <b>to</b> hold {{them all the}} time". They also declared victory after one election, claiming all candidates were Rhinoceroses, whether they knew or acknowledged it: thick-skinned, short-sighted, mean-tempered, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Nicks {{has said}} that she {{consciously}} chose not to have children of her own, due to her demanding career and desire to follow her art wherever it should take her: [...] "My mission maybe wasn't to be a mom and a wife; maybe my particular mission was to write songs to make moms and wives feel better." [...] She finds maternal fulfillment through her niece, godchildren, and extended family: [...] "I have lots of kids. It's <b>much</b> more <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> be the crazy auntie {{than it is to}} be the mom, anyway." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} do this tour across Canada in a bus and not by a plane {{to get to know the}} country better. I've played my sets in various towns over the past few years and I've always wished to come back and explore. I also thought it would be a good idea to have a kind of {{souvenir}} of my Canadian journey to share with all the people who come out and party when I play. That's the reason behind this compilation. I really hope you have as <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> listening <b>to</b> it as I did mixing it. Thanks, Benny".|$|R
500|$|Rob Fitzpatrick of NME {{characterized}} Beyoncé's {{breathing heavily}} while grabbing the [...] "imaginary" [...] bedsheets but remained a [...] "devout young Christian woman singing {{what the public}} wants her to sing." [...] Describing [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] as an uptempo party track, Lisa Verrico of The Times commented that the song features [...] "an unusually high-pitched Beyoncé singing lines such as 'The rhythm's got me going crazy'". Neil Drumming of Entertainment Weekly found Beyoncé's singing [...] "not quite convincingly a naughty girl". This was echoed by Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times who said {{it was fun to}} hear Beyoncé mimicking [...] "the pizzicato line" [...] in [...] "Naughty Girl", and that it was not <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> hear her try to sing [...] "like a naughty girl". Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic commented that [...] "Storch does his most convincing imitation of the Neptunes writing their own Kashmir in a Middle Eastern restaurant".|$|E
500|$|One {{frequently}} criticised {{aspect of}} the game was its low and inconsistent frame rate. According to Trigger Happy author Steven Poole, [...] "The game's inadequate temporal resolution—owing to a wrongheaded choice to privilege visual detail over frame-rate—made it unplayable at higher difficulty levels." [...] In contrast, IGN {{pointed out that the}} frame rate [...] "can be sluggish in certain wide-open areas or when there are lots of enemies on-screen, but for some odd reason it's never really bothersome. Most of the time you're so caught up in the game that you don't notice it, and when you do, you're willing to forgive it as Perfect Dark is just too <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> dwell on such an issue". Poole also described the [...] "lazy sci-fi fetishism" [...] of Joanna Dark's character design as [...] "a blatant and doomed attempt to steal the thunder of Lara Croft", and argued that she illustrated the challenges of characterising the protagonists of first-person shooters, a problem that GoldenEye 007 had avoided by using the already well-known character James Bond.|$|E
500|$|After Underwood's Play On Tour {{ended in}} December 2010, {{she started to}} work on her then-untitled fourth studio album. Sony Music Nashville chairman/CEO Gary Overton said that the singer [...] "took nearly a year to compile and record the songs." [...] Songwriters Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who {{previously}} wrote [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] for Underwood's debut album, Some Hearts, worked on a track titled [...] "Blown Away" [...] {{and sent it to}} the singer. Underwood loved the song and recorded it, also naming her album Blown Away as it was the song that defined the album's darker direction. She then started writing material with several songwriters, including Hillary Lindsey and Kear. Together, the trio wrote [...] "Two Black Cadillacs", which is about two women finding out that they both are involved in a relationship with the same man and set their differences aside to kill him. Underwood said that [...] "it was so <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> write and just be in that room" [...] with Lindsey and Kear, as they [...] "didn't really know what to expect or where we were headed or what we would end up with." [...] Kear described the writing session: ...|$|E
2500|$|When he {{auditioned for}} Naruto, which was being {{directed}} by the same person who did Rave Master, he had tried out for multiple roles including Sasuke and Iruka, and got a call back for Sasuke. In an interview with Silionera, Lowenthal said that [...] "It certainly allows {{me to go to}} some dark places as the series continues. And it makes Sasuke that much more interesting as a character. And that <b>much</b> more <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play." [...] The Naruto anime became one of the more popular anime shows in the U.S., and its sequel Naruto Shippuden has also aired on Adult Swim.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the time}} of Monty Python's 25th anniversary, in 1994, the point was already being made that [...] "the five {{surviving}} members had with the passing years begun to occupy an institutional position in the edifice of British social culture that they had once had so <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> trying <b>to</b> demolish". A similar point is made in a 2006 book {{on the relationship between}} Monty and philosophy: [...] "It is remarkable, after all, not only that the utterly bizarre Monty Python's Flying Circus was sponsored by the BBC in the first place, but that Monty Python itself grew into an institution of enormous cultural influence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps Leetil Tim is too <b>much</b> given <b>to</b> <b>fun</b> when {{he talks}} with Big Tim," [...] {{suggested}} the red chief gravely, but with a slight twinkle in his eyes, which told {{that he was not}} quite destitute of Little Tim's weakness--or strength, as the reader chooses.|$|R
500|$|... "The One {{with the}} Embryos" [...] was Courteney Cox and Matt LeBlanc's {{favorite}} {{episode of the}} series. Cox liked the episode because she enjoys playing Monica at her most competitive, while LeBlanc spoke fondly of {{the pace of the}} episode and the information about the characters that came out. He identified scenes that featured just the six core cast as the best, [...] "because you don't have to introduce a character–you don't have to lay any pipeline–you just get right to the funny". On the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Marta Kauffman cited the episode being [...] "so <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> do" [...] and enjoyed the writing process. The scene involving Phoebe talking to the embryos was Kevin S. Bright's favorite in the show's history because of Kudrow's ability to [...] "draw you into the scene ... even though it's only her talking to the dish". David Crane highlights how the episode explores generosity; doing a selfless act which pays off when Phoebe [...] gives birth in [...] "The One Hundredth". Bright moreover felt the trivia contest was the catalyst that rejuvenated the entire fourth season and [...] "put Friends in a different place".|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{felt that}} the CD version of the album was [...] "not all that <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> hear, even if the reinterpretations of the 20-year-old hits are interesting. The DVD doesn't feel as cold thanks entirely to the pizzazz of the visuals and the {{determined}} efficiency of the show, but even so, this is primarily {{of interest to the}} diehards who don't mind purchasing another live CD/DVD set just a year after the first." [...] Ed Gonzalez from Slant Magazine {{felt that the}} concert finale in the album [...] "is a reminder that Madonna's music need not be motivated by sex or politics to be good as long as it displays a smidgen of heart and soul." [...] Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine also complimented the finale of the tour. According to him, [...] " [...] is almost exclusively up-tempo, staged within an inch of its life yet more vivacious than anything she's done in years. Its CD companion is a pared-down 13 tracks taken from the live show, and good God it smokes." [...] However, he felt that the disc loses its momentum during the [...] "Confessions" [...] part, which demonstrates a trio of individuals confessing about their sufferings in life.|$|E
500|$|Nixon infused {{elements}} of those literatures into the Dimitri and Natalie romance with as well. [...] "There's a gothic quality to it", she said, {{referring to the}} couple. [...] "It's Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Everybody loves somebody who has a past and a secret- and certainly Dimitri does- which we haven't divulged yet. That heightens ones interest and suspense. It's a special situation but what really makes it special is the actor's talent, personalities, good looks, and chemistry." [...] Since the writers created Dimitri as a very mysterious character, Michael Nader mostly {{stayed away from the}} press in order to help maintain that image. Whenever he did do an interview, he discussed the character {{in such a way as}} to add more mystery. Nader compared Dimitri to the Dynasty character he once portrayed, Dex Dexter. On Dynasty, [...] "John James (Jeff Colby) played the 'aw, shucks;' nice guy, and I played the guy who was on the edge, who would take care of business and not take any bull", he said. [...] "Dimitri is sort of a darker Dex. Though I don't know exactly how dark to make him yet." [...] Nader, as an actor, also provided the writers with more inspiration on the character. [...] "The more we see of him, the more he inspires us", Broderick said. [...] "It's just a wonderful marriage of actor and character He's giving us so many levels and such depth, that it's a challenge. But it's exciting. Dimitri is one of the characters that is so <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> write." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker {{considered}} Buscemi miscast as {{the central}} figure in the drama. [...] "Buscemi can’t play that kind of character; even {{at the age of}} fifty-two, he looks cagey and restless—not like a guy at the top but like the guy who gets killed when he tries to knock off the guy at the top." [...] The review concludes [...] "Boardwalk Empire” is at great pains to give viewers a sense that they are there, and yet rarely did I feel engrossed in the show. Even if its point is to show you the ugly side of fun, Boardwalk Empire should be <b>much</b> more <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> watch." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{beginning}} of summer, 1966; {{because of his}} father's job situation, freshman high school student Kaoru Nishimi moves by himself from Yokosuka to Sasebo in Kyushu to live with relatives. Until then, Kaoru was an honor roll student who tended to keep to himself, but meeting notorious [...] "bad boy" [...] Sentaro Kawabuchi starts to change him. Through his devil-may-care classmate, Kaoru learns how <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> it is <b>to</b> play jazz and finds the first person he can call a real friend.|$|R
60|$|Since {{earliest}} childhood he {{had been}} a searcher after <b>fun,</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> the sorrow of his fellow-apes, and now he saw the humor of the frightened panic of the apes and the baffled rage of Numa even in this grim jungle adventure which had robbed Mamka of life, and jeopardized that of many members of the tribe.|$|R
