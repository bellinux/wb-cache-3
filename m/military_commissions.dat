5|$|The Supreme Court {{announced}} its decision on June 29, 2006. The Court reversed the ruling of the Court of Appeals, holding that President George W.

5|$|Because Justice Anthony Kennedy did {{not join}} Stevens' opinion as to several parts, largely {{on the grounds of}} {{judicial}} parsimony (that is, having decided that the <b>military</b> <b>commissions</b> had no foundation, the core question of the case was decided and the Court did not need to go further), those sections were without a majority in support.|$|E

5|$|Finally, Justice Scalia chastises the Court {{for taking}} equity {{jurisdiction}} {{of the case and}} draws an analogy with Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U.S. 738 (1975). In that case, the Supreme Court declined passing judgment on the decision of a military court-martial before it finished its work; Scalia argues that likewise, the <b>military</b> <b>commissions</b> in Cuba have not yet ended their work regarding Hamdan and therefore should not be subject to judicial oversight.|$|E
5|$|On June 29, 2006, the Court {{issued a}} 5–3 {{decision}} holding {{that it had}} jurisdiction, and that the administration did not have authority to set up these particular <b>military</b> <b>commissions</b> without congressional authorization, {{because they did not}} comply with the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Convention (which the court found to be incorporated into the Uniform Code of Military Justice).|$|E

40|$|In October {{and at the}} {{beginning}} of November 1788 in the Sejm there was a debate on the abolition of the Military Department of the Permanent Council (dependent on Russia) and the establishment of the <b>Military</b> <b>Commission.</b> During the debate two visions of the <b>Military</b> <b>Commission</b> emerged. The dominating one was the concept promoted by the Puławy party and the independence-oriented deputies. According to this concept the <b>Military</b> <b>Commission</b> was an institution connected with the reformist roots of "The Family" from 1764. This vision of the <b>Military</b> <b>Commission</b> appealed to the gentry because it realised the concept of the democratic (civic) state referring to the emancipation and anti-magnate tendencies of the provincial gentry. The other concept of the <b>Military</b> <b>Commission</b> was formulated by the royal party {{in order to keep the}} Permanent Council and the Military Department. It was a vision of the <b>Military</b> <b>Commission</b> which was temporarily (in the years 1775 - 1776) dominated by hetman Franciszek Ksawery Branicki and which, as a result, was treated as an institution allegedly susceptible to hetman's influence. Finally, the concept of the <b>Military</b> <b>Commission</b> promoted by the Puławy party and the independence-oriented deputies won. The parliamentary debate ending in the abolition of the Military Department and the establishment of the <b>Military</b> <b>Commission</b> (during the session of 3 rd November 1788) shows how close the Enlightenment breakthrough initiated by "The Family" in 1764 was to the landed gentry (prevailing in the Sejm) ...|$|R
5000|$|The Central <b>Military</b> <b>Commission</b> (CMC) {{refers to}} the {{parallel}} national defense organizations of the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China: the Central <b>Military</b> <b>Commission</b> of the Communist Party of China, a Party organ under the CPC Central Committee, and the Central <b>Military</b> <b>Commission</b> of the People's Republic of China, a central state organ under the National People's Congress, being the military branch of the national government.|$|R
5|$|On October 17, 2006, Bush {{signed into}} law the <b>Military</b> <b>Commissions</b> Act of 2006, a law enacted {{in the wake of}} the Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, , which allows the U.S. government to prosecute unlawful enemy combatants by military commission rather than a standard trial. The law also denies them access to habeas corpus and bars the torture of detainees, but allows the president to determine what constitutes torture.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, the <b>Military</b> <b>Commissions</b> Act of 2006 {{may have}} raised again {{the issue of}} which court would hear cases such as Hamdan's. The U.S. Department of Justice has filed notice with several federal judges, and given notice to {{hundreds}} of detainees, that the habeas petitions of alien unlawful enemy combatants (or those whose status is to be determined) are not within the jurisdiction of those courts.|$|E
5|$|The case {{considers}} {{whether the}} United States Congress may pass legislation preventing the Supreme Court from hearing {{the case of}} an accused combatant before his military commission takes place, whether the special <b>military</b> <b>commissions</b> that had been set up violated federal law (including the Uniform Code of Military Justice and treaty obligations), and whether courts can enforce the articles of the 1949 Geneva Convention.|$|E

5|$|Reportedly, Tiberius once {{ran into}} Vipsania again, and {{proceeded}} to follow her home crying and begging forgiveness; soon afterwards, Tiberius met with Augustus, and steps were taken to ensure that Tiberius and Vipsania would never meet again. Tiberius continued to be elevated by Augustus, and after Agrippa's death and his brother Drusus' death in 9BC, seemed the clear candidate for succession. As such, in 12BC he received <b>military</b> <b>commissions</b> in Pannonia and Germania; both areas highly volatile and of key importance to Augustan policy.|$|E
5|$|Departing {{from the}} main central {{administrative}} system generally known as the Three Departments and Six Ministries system, which was instituted by various dynasties since late Han (202 BCE – 220 CE), the Ming administration had only one Department, the Secretariat, that controlled the Six Ministries. Following {{the execution of the}} Chancellor Hu Weiyong in 1380, the Hongwu Emperor abolished the Secretariat, the Censorate, and the Chief Military Commission and personally took charge of the Six Ministries and the regional Five <b>Military</b> <b>Commissions.</b> Thus a whole level of administration was cut out and only partially rebuilt by subsequent rulers. The Grand Secretariat, at the beginning a secretarial institution that assisted the emperor with administrative paperwork, was instituted, but without employing grand counselors, or chancellors.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur was {{responsible}} for confirming and enforcing the sentences for war crimes handed down by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. In late 1945, Allied <b>military</b> <b>commissions</b> in various cities of the Orient tried 5,700 Japanese, Taiwanese and Koreans for war crimes. About 4,300 were convicted, almost 1,000 sentenced to death, and hundreds given life imprisonment. The charges arose from incidents that included the Rape of Nanking, the Bataan Death March and Manila massacre. The trial in Manila of Yamashita was criticized because he was hanged for Iwabuchi's Manila massacre, which he had not ordered and {{of which he was}} probably unaware. Iwabuchi had killed himself as the battle for Manila was ending.|$|E

5|$|Nasser's {{nomination}} {{for the post}} and the new constitution were put to public referendum on 23 June and each was approved by an overwhelming majority. A 350-member National Assembly was established, elections for which were held in July 1957. Nasser had ultimate approval over all the candidates. The constitution granted women's suffrage, prohibited gender-based discrimination, and entailed special protection {{for women in the}} workplace. Coinciding with the new constitution and Nasser's presidency, the RCC dissolved itself and its members resigned their <b>military</b> <b>commissions</b> as part of the transition to civilian rule. During the deliberations surrounding the establishment of a new government, Nasser began a process of sidelining his rivals among the original Free Officers, while elevating his closest allies to high-ranking positions in the cabinet.|$|E
5|$|In August 1909, a {{group of}} army {{officers}} that had formed a military league, Stratiotikos Syndesmos, demanded, among other things, that the royal family be stripped of their <b>military</b> <b>commissions.</b> To save the King the embarrassment of removing his sons from their commissions, they resigned them. The military league attempted a coup d'état, and the King insisted on supporting the duly elected Hellenic Parliament in response. Eventually, the military league joined forces with Venizelos in calling for a National Assembly to revise the constitution. King George gave way, and new elections to the revising assembly were held in August 1910. After some political maneuvering, Venizelos became prime minister of a minority government. Just a month later, Venizelos called new elections for , at which he won an overwhelming majority after most of the opposition parties declined to take part.|$|E
