5|$|Some early Christian {{groups had}} {{separate}} {{descriptions of the}} life and teachings of Jesus that {{are not included in}} the New Testament.

5|$|The {{minister}} {{asked for}} expert advice {{and the debate}} continued in the newspapers.

5|$|There was no {{distinct}} {{break in}} the line of the royal family between the 17th and 18th dynasties. The historian Manetho, writing <b>much</b> <b>later</b> during the Ptolemaic dynasty, considered the final expulsion of the Hyksos after nearly a century and the restoration of native Egyptian rule over the whole country a significant enough event to warrant {{the start of a new}} dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Æthelberht's reign {{may have}} begun in 779, the date {{provided}} {{for the beginning of}} his reign on the uncertain authority of a <b>much</b> <b>later</b> saint's life.

5|$|After Michael VIII's death, the Byzantines {{suffered}} from constant civil strife early on. The Ottomans suffered civil conflict as well, but this occurred <b>much</b> <b>later</b> {{on in the}} 15th century, {{by that time the}} Byzantines were too weak to reconquer much territory. This is in contrast to the civil strife of Byzantium, occurring at a time (1341–71) when the Ottomans were crossing into Europe through a devastated Gallipoli and surrounding the city, thus sealing its fate as a vassal. When attempts were made to break this vassalage, the Byzantines found themselves out-matched and at the mercy of Latin assistance, which despite two Crusades, ultimately amounted to nothing.|$|E
5|$|An inquest {{was held}} on 22 December; the jury could not {{determine}} whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and {{the outline of a}} new will was found among the papers in the flat. <b>Much</b> <b>later,</b> Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators.|$|E

Dawsholm was almost entirely industrial; for many years {{there had been an}} important textile printing works there and a large Corporation gasworks had been established there in 1871 and <b>much</b> extended <b>later.</b> <b>Much</b> supplementary industry, including a chemical works, was being established there.|$|R

5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} suggests that Nri hegemony in Igboland may go {{back as far as}} the 9th century, and royal burials have been unearthed dating to at least the 10th century. Eri, the god-like founder of Nri, is believed to have settled the region around 948, with other related Igbo cultures following after in the 13th century. The first eze Nri (King of Nri), Ìfikuánim, follows directly after him. According to Igbo oral tradition, his reign started in 1043. At least one historian puts Ìfikuánim's reign <b>much</b> <b>later,</b> around 1225 CE.|$|E
5|$|As it was, Heilmann's {{conclusion}} was so persuasive that it forestalled further {{debate on the}} subject {{even in the face}} of additional conflicting evidence. In 1936, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp described a new theropod from the Jurassic of North America, Segisaurus. Like Oviraptor, Segisaurus had an unmistakable clavicle, but unlike Oviraptor, it was also plainly identified as being such in the paper that described it. Despite this, the implication of a wishbone-bearing dinosaur was blatantly ignored until <b>much</b> <b>later,</b> and for many years the state of dinosaur research stagnated, possibly due to the effects of the Depression and World War II.|$|E
5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} on 1 June 1727 in the Nikolaikirche. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that a printed libretto for the congregation was recently {{found in the}} Russian National Library in St. Petersburg, containing the texts for the three feast days of Pentecost and Trinity of 1727. Until then the work had been dated <b>much</b> <b>later,</b> such as 1746 when a revival took place for which performance material exists. As {{the music of the}} 1727 version is lost, the timing of Bach's revisions to the wedding cantata is not known. It is likely that he revised it further in the 1740s because he wrote a new score.|$|E
