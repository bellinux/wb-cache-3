Though commonly asserted that left-handed fencers have an advantage over right-handed opponents because the line of defence favors their sword arm, this assertion describes both fencers in a <b>mixed-handed</b> duel, so neither competitor has a unique physical advantage. Thus the left-hander's advantage in fencing stems mostly from a right-hander's unfamiliarity with a left-handed stance.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is twofold. First, we tested the view that {{individuals}} who do not develop a typically strong behavioral laterality are distributed differentially among the two genders across age. Second, we examined whether left handedness and mixed handedness are associated with an elevated risk of some developmental or cognitive deficits. A special recruitment procedure provided norms of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) copy from large samples of left-handed () and <b>mixed-handed</b> () compared to right-handed () schoolchildren and adults (). This graphic task was considered as reflective of the growth of visual-spatial skills and impairment at copying as a developmental risk. Subjects’ hand preference was assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. Data analysis indicated that (1) the trend towards consistent right handedness is sex related. Girls are clearly ahead of boys in this lateralization process, and boys are overrepresented in <b>mixed-handed</b> subjects. The greater prevalence of <b>mixed-handed</b> boys compared to girls decreases with age. (2) Performance on drawing the ROCF varies according to age and handedness groups. <b>Mixed-handed</b> subjects scored worse in all age groups. The results are discussed in relation to the hormonal-developmental, neuropathological, and learning theories of lateralization...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Problems with {{language}} {{and symptoms of}} attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in childhood and adolescence are often strongly linked to low scholastic performance. Early recognition {{of children who are}} at increased risk is necessary. Our objective was to determine whether mixed-handedness, which is associated with atypical cerebral laterality, is associated {{with language}}, scholastic, and ADHD symptoms in childhood and adolescence. METHODS: Prospective data come from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986, a longitudinal, population-based birth cohort with assessments when children were 7 to 8 and 16 years of age (N = 7871). Teacher, parent, and/or adolescent reports were used to assess language difficulties, scholastic performance, and mental health, including ADHD symptoms. RESULTS: <b>Mixed-handed</b> children, relative to right-handed, had approximately a twofold increase in odds of having difficulties with language and scholastic performance at the age of 8 years. Eight years later, as 16 -year-olds, adolescents had twofold increase in odds concerning difficulties in school with language and with ADHD symptoms. <b>Mixed-handed</b> children {{were more likely to have}} scores indicating probable psychiatric disturbance, including ADHD symptoms. As adolescents, <b>mixed-handed</b> children with previous behavioral problems were at considerably higher risk for scoring within the range of probable ADHD-inattention or ADHD-combined case. Mixed-handedness was associated with greater symptom severity in children and adolescents (P =. 01) concerning psychiatric disturbance and ADHD inattention but not ADHD hyperactivity. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that <b>mixed-handed</b> children have a greater likelihood of having language, scholastic, and mental health problems in childhood and that these persist into adolescence. Thus, these results suggest that mixed-handedness, particularly in the presence of difficulties, could aid in the recognition of children who are at risk for stable problems. Additional research is needed to understand the connections between neural substrates related to atypical cerebral asymmetry, mixed-handedness, and mental health problems including ADHD symptoms...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} lateral bias in patients with early-onset schizophrenia. Hand, eye, and foot preferences and relative hand skill were examined in early-onset patients (n= 44) and matched controls (n= 39), and were compared with population estimates. Patients demonstrated a significant excess in mixed handedness (20. 5 % vs. 8. 5 %) relative to population estimates and reduced relative hand skill on a pegboard task compared with controls. Left eye preference was significantly less common in schizophrenic patients relative to population estimates. Crossed eye-hand and eye-foot preferences were not significantly increased in the patient group as a whole but were present, respectively, in four of nine and five of nine <b>mixed-handed</b> patients but in none of five <b>mixed-handed</b> controls.

We report findings from a large scale investigation of relationships between brain anatomy and behavioral asymmetry on a battery of visual word recognition tasks. A sample of 200 individuals was divided into groups on the basis of sex and consistency of handedness. We investigated differences between sex/handedness groups in callosal area and relationships between callosal area and behavioral predictors. Sex/handedness groups did not show systematic differences in callosal area or behavioral asymmetry. However, the groups differed in the relationships between area of the corpus callosum and behavioral asymmetry. Among consistent-handed males, callosal area was negatively related to behavioral laterality. Among <b>mixed-handed</b> males and consistent-handed females, behavioral laterality was not predictive of callosal area. The most robust relationship was observed in <b>mixed-handed</b> females, in whom behavioral asymmetry was positively related to callosal area. Our study demonstrates the importance of considering brain/behavior relationships within sub-populations, as relationships between behavioral asymmetry and callosal anatomy varied across subject groups. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to see the incidence of peripheral laterality in schizophrenics and depressed patients. A total of 147 male subjects (29 schizophrenics, 38 depressed, 80 non-patient controls) were asked to indicate their preferences for hand, foot, eye, and ear on the Sidedness Bias Schedule. The correlations among the laterality quotients (LQ) in all the three groups were positive and highly significant except the foot-eye correlation in the non-patient controls. The left and <b>mixed-handed</b> schizophrenics and depressed subjects exhibited extreme left and mixed preference for foot, eye, and ear, respectively. Hand and ear preferences emerged as the predictors of schizophrenia and depression in the logistic regression analysis. The findings indicate a possible relationship between psychopathology and extreme left-mixed dominance...|$|E
40|$|Left-handedness is {{historically}} associated with poorer outcomes for adults. Yet recent work {{has suggested that}} there may be positive labour market returns for left-handed males. This paper examines whether handedness is also associated with poorer outcomes for children and whether this differs by genders. The paper examines a wide set of outcomes for children as they age from 42 months to 14 years. We find the main penalty is not from being left-handed, but is from not having a dominant hand early in life. This penalty is larger for girls than boys by age 14, indicating that early deficits of non-right handed boys appear to fall as they age. For girls, being left-handed and especially <b>mixed-handed</b> at early ages is associated with persistent cognitive attainment deficits, mainly focused {{at the lower end of}} the ability distribution.

40|$|Multiple factors {{determine}} handedness including genetics, prenatal {{stress and}} post-natal environmental conditions. Atypical handedness, whether manifest as increased sinistral-ity or decreased strength of lateral preference, {{has been noted}} {{in a wide variety}} of populations with neuropathology.

This paper uses the largest sample of phallometrically assessed men to date to establish the pattern of atypical handedness in paedophilia. Specifically, whereas prior research has largely characterized participants dichotomously as right-handed or non-right-handed and/or used self-report of writing hand, this paper expands upon such reports by using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory’s laterality quotient. Participants ’ handedness and phallometri-cally assessed sexual preference were analyzed both as continuous and categorical variables, and the responses of those scoring in the range of ambiguous-handedness were evaluated to ascertain whether they were ambiguously handed or more accurately described as <b>mixed-handed.</b> Results indicated those producing scores in the range of ambiguous-handedness demonstrated response patterns consistent with ambiguous...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, a {{large body}} of {{research}} has investigated the various factors affecting child development and the consequent impact of child development on future educational and labor market outcomes. In this article, we contribute to this literature by investigating the effect of handedness on child development. This is an important issue given that around 10 % of the world’s population is left-handed and given recent research demonstrating that child development strongly affects adult outcomes. Using a large, nationally representative sample of young children, we find that the probability of a child being left-handed is not significantly related to child health at birth, family composition, parental employment, or household income. We also find robust evidence that left-handed (and <b>mixed-handed)</b> children perform significantly worse in nearly all measures of development than right-handed children, with the relative disadvantage being larger for boys than girls. Importantly, these differentials cannot be explained by different socioeconomic characteristics of the household, parental attitudes, or investments in learning resources...|$|E
40|$|Atypical lateralization, as {{indicated}} by mixed-handedness, has been related to diverse psychopathologies. Maternal prenatal stress has recently been associated with mixed-handedness in the offspring. In the present study, this relationship was investigated further in a prospective, methodologically comprehensive manner. Stress levels were determined three times during pregnancy by means of questionnaires and measurements of cortisol levels. The handedness of 110 6 -y-old children (48 boys) was determined by independent observers. Mixed handedness was defined as using the opposite hand for {{one or more of}} the tested activities. Logistic regression analysis showed that more maternal daily hassles in late pregnancy and maternal mixed-handedness increased the chance of mixed-handedness in the offspring. In contrast, more pregnancy-related fear in late pregnancy and a longer duration of gestation were associated with a smaller chance of being <b>mixed-handed.</b> Prenatal stress measured during the first two periods of pregnancy or determined by cortisol was not related to mixed-handedness in the offspring. In conclusion, reported and physiologic measures of prenatal stress in a moderately stressed pregnant population were only partly related to offspring mixed-handedness...|$|E
40|$|The {{respective}} {{roles of}} the environment and innate talent have been a recurrent question for research into expertise. This paper investigates markers of talent, environment, and critical period for the acquisition of expert performance in chess. Argentinian chessplayers (N = 104), ranging from weak amateurs to grandmasters, filled in a questionnaire measuring variables including individual and group practice, starting age, and handedness. The study reaffirms the importance of practice for reaching high levels of performance, but also indicates a large variability, the slower player needing eight times more practice to reach master level than the faster. Additional results show a correlation between skill and starting age, and indicate that players {{are more likely to be}} <b>mixed-handed</b> than individuals in the general population; however, there was no correlation between handedness and skill within the chess sample. Together, these results suggest that practice is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the acquisition of expertise, that some additional factors may differentiate between chessplayers and non-chessplayers, and that the starting age of practice is important...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{examined}} the interrelation of everyday life handedness and hand preference in basketball, as an area of expertise that requires individuals being proficient with both their nondominant and dominant hand. A secondary aim was to elucidate the link between basketball-specific practice, hand preference in basketball and everyday life handedness. Therefore, 176 expert basketball players self-reported their hand preference for {{activities of daily living}} and for basketball-specific behavior as well as details about their basketball-specific history via questionnaire. We found that compared to the general population the one-hand bias was significantly reduced for both everyday life and basketball-specific hand preference (i. e., a higher prevalence of <b>mixed-handed</b> individuals), and that both concepts were significantly related. Moreover, only preference scores for lay-up and dribbling skills were significantly related to measures of basketball-specific practice. Consequently, training-induced modulations of lateral preference seem to be very specific to only a few basketball-specific skills, and do not generalize to other skills within the domain of basketball nor do they extend into everyday life handedness. The results are discussed in terms of their relevance regarding theories of handedness and their practical implications for the sport of basketball...|$|E
40|$|Most {{people are}} right-handed, preferring {{the right hand}} for skilled as well as unskilled activities, but a notable {{proportion}} are <b>mixed-handed,</b> preferring to use the right hand for some actions and the left hand for others. Assuming a structural/functional correlation in the motor system we tested whether asymmetries in hand performance in consistent right and left handers {{as well as in}} mixed handers are associated with anatomical asymmetries in the motor cortex. In vivo MR morphometry was used for analyzing interhemispheric asymmetry in the depth of the central sulcus in the region of cortical hand representation of 103 healthy subjects. Subjects were tested both for hand preference and hand performance. As expected, left-right differences in hand performance differed significantly between consistent right, consistent left and mixed handers and were independent on gender. Male consistent right handers showed a significant deeper central sulcus on the left hemisphere than on the right. Anatomical asymmetries decreased significantly from male consistent right over mixed to consistent left handers. Sixty two per cent of consistent left handers revealed a deeper central sulcus on the right than on the left hemisphere, but for the group as a whole this rightward asymmetry was not significant. No interhemispheric asymmetry was found in females. Thus, anatomical asymmetry was associated with handedness only in males, but nor in females, suggesting sex differences in the cortical organization of hand movements. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|This article completes {{a series}} of 3 studies on the lateral {{preferences}} of Brazilians of different age ranges. In previous reports, we assessed the lateral preferences of adults {{ranging in age from}} 20 to 72 years (Brito, Brito, Paumgartten,&Lins, 1989) and 4 - to 7 -year-old schoolchildren (Brito, Lins, Paumgartten,&Brito, 1992). In this study, we evaluated the lateral preferences of 625 children with ages ranging from 8 to 15 years with different measures of handedness derived from the Edinburgh Inventory (Oldfield, 1971). We found significant age and sex effects which depended on the measure of handedness. Factor analysis of the inventory revealed a single factor. Comparison of the data with those reported previously confirmed a sex effect on the distribution of handedness categories. Additionally, we found that the distribution of handedness categories in 4 - to 7 -year-old children and 8 - to 15 -year-old children differs from that found in adults, and removal of inventory items with reduced factorial validity (opening a box for both samples of children and broom for adults) accentuates these differences. Children are more <b>mixed-handed</b> and less right-handed. Item analyses of the data indicated that these differences are only partially dependent on the degree of novelty of the tasks included in the inventory. The implications of these life span age trends in laterality for current hypotheses involving experience-induced neural plasticity in interaction with environmental factors are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{and crystal}} {{structure of a}} norbornane derivative decorated with isoxazoline and methylpyrolidine- 2, 5 -dione ring, C 19 H 20 N 2 O 5, were determined and characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic methods. Details of the molecular geometry having six stereogenic centers reveal {{that there are two}} enantiomeric forms in the crystal structure of the compound, S- and R-enantiomer named with respect to the majority of chiral centers. The same type enantiomers are used as building blocks in formation of noncovalent helices by weak C-H⋯O and C-H⋯N type H-bonds. While S-enantiomers form P-helix, R-enantiomers take part in the formation of M-helix. The intertwined P- and M- helices, yielding from supramolecular chirality of the compound, are interconnected by weak C-H⋯O type H-bonds. Thus, <b>mixed-handed</b> noncovalent DNA mimicry of the compound contrary to natural pure-handed DNA forms is established. The presence of weak H-bonds allowing DNA mimicry of the compound in a noncovalent manner is verified by QTAIM and Hirshfeld surface analyses. To the best of our knowledge, norbornane derivative examined here is the first example of noncovalent DNA-mimetic based on an unnatural organic small molecule. The stability level of the H-bonded helices of the compound is comparable to those of helical peptide chains, approximately half of their stabilities.

40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} hemispheric differences in corticospinal excitability and in transcallosal inhibition in a selected {{group of young}} adults (n = 34) grouped into three handedness categories (RH: strongly right-handed, n = 17; LH: strongly left-handed, n = 10; MH: <b>mixed-handed,</b> n = 7) based on laterality quotients (LQ) derived from the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. Performance measures were also used to derive a laterality index reflecting right-left asymmetries in manual dexterity (Dextli) and in finger tapping speed (Speedli). Corticospinal excitability was assessed in each hemisphere by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) using the first dorsal interosseus as the target muscle. TMS measures consisted of resting motor threshold (rMT), motor evoked potential (MEP) recruitment curve (RC) and the contralateral silent period (cSP) with the accompanying MEP facilitation. Hemispheric interactions were assessed {{by means of the}} ipsilateral silent period (iSP) to determine the onset latency and the duration of transcallosal inhibition (i. e., LTI and DTI). Analysis of hemispheric variations in measures of corticospinal excitability revealed no major asymmetries in relation to degrees of laterality or handedness, {{with the exception of a}} rightward increase in rMTs in the LH group. Similarly, no clear asymmetries were found when looking at hemispheric variations in measures of transcallosal inhibition. However, a large group effect was detected for LTI measures, which were found to be significantly shorter in the MH group than in either the LH or RH group. MH participants also tended to show longer DTI than the other participants. Further inspection of overall variations in LTI an...|$|E
40|$|The {{corpus callosum}} {{provides}} a physical and functional {{connection between the}} two hemispheres of the brain allowing interactions between homologous cognitive, sensory and motor areas. In humans, the integrity of transcallosal connections between motor cortices can be evaluated quickly and non-invasively using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) via the ipsilateral silent period (iSP). While the technique has been known for 20 years, many issues remain unsolved regarding which methods are best to elicit the iSP as an index of transcallosal inhibition. In addition, there is still limited information regarding the influence of individualized factors such as age on iSP measurements. This thesis investigates how common physiological and methodological factors influence the iSP in order to establish this method as a reliable index to assess the integrity of the transcallosal pathway linking primary motor cortices. In the first series of experiments, we used a previously described TMS protocol to elicit iSPs [1] to investigate changes in motor transcallosal inhibition in relation to individual factors linked to age, hand preference and history of concussions. A second series of methodological experiments examined the effects of stimulation intensity on the iSP and to determine its inter-session reliability. Our first series of experiments provided evidence that advancing age and history of concussions in young athletes were each independently associated with alterations in transcallosal inhibition. This was evidenced by changes in the duration of transcallosal inhibition (DTI) and in the latency of transcallosal inhibition (LTI) derived from iSP measurements. These experiments also revealed that the degree of hand preference in young adults was reflected in measures of transcallosal inhibition, so that <b>mixed-handed</b> individuals (i. e., ambidextrous) exhibited evidence of more efficient transcallosal transmission than either strong right or left handed individuals. The second series of experiments focusing on methodological aspects showed that the iSP duration (though not its onset) was influenced by stimulation intensity, increasing linearly with intensity up to 140...|$|E
