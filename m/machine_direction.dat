2500|$|Tensile {{strength}} {{represents the}} ability for a geomembrane to resist tensile stress. [...] Geomembranes are most commonly tested for tensile strength using one of three methods; the uniaxial tensile test described in ASTM D639-94, the wide-strip tensile test described in ASTM D4885-88, and the multiaxial tension test described in ASTM D5617-94. [...] The difference in these three methods lies in the boundaries imposed into the test specimens. [...] Uniaxial tests do not provide lateral restraint during testing and thus tests the sample under uniaxial stress conditions. [...] During the wide-strip test the sample is restrained laterally while the middle portion is unrestrained. [...] The multiaxial tensile test provides a plane stress boundary condition {{at the edges of}} the sample. [...] A typical range of tensile strengths in the <b>machine</b> <b>direction</b> are from 225 to 245lb/in for 60-mil HDPE to 280 to 325lb/in for 80-mil HDPE.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Paper-based {{material}} has been frequently used {{as part of}} packaging solution as an option towards reducing municipal solid waste generation. Various studies on mechanical behaviour of paper-pulp packaging material have been conducted based on the <b>machining</b> <b>direction</b> and cross <b>machining</b> <b>direction.</b> However, there is still gap of information on paper-pulp packaging material behaviour at diagonal direction. A study has been conducted to investigate the variability to tensile properties of paper-pulp packaging at various packaging section (draft and base surface) and different specimen orientation (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal direction). In this research, results from the stress-strain relationship obtained from tensile and compression tests are presented. The data obtained are further analysed using ANOVA {{to find out whether}} material variations are significantly different with varying sections and orientations. Findings in this research supported the anisotropic properties of paper-based packaging material. Draft surfaces exhibit weaker strength than base surface. Also, the variability of stiffness and strength of specimens are more significant in horizontal and vertical direction compared to diagonal direction...|$|R

40|$|A {{collaborative}} research project {{was set up}} to study peripheral diamond wheel machining damage in silicon nitride ceramics. The objective of the work to be carried out at the University of Surrey was to study the nature and depth of machining damage in 3 point flexural rupture test bars made from 5 wt% Y 2 O 3 sintered hot isostatically pressed silicon nitride. The bars were machined to three surface finishes. The work carried out at Rolls-Royce by Mr R Quinn concentrated on the effects the machining damage had on the fracture strengths of the test bars. Work at the University of Surrey has identified in detail the nature and depth of machining damage in "coarse" 0. 4 mum centre line average roughness surfaces. Deep grooves up to 2 mum depth, 18 mum width are found to have been superimposed on the general surface roughness by singularly large diamonds in the 350 grit diamond wheel. Sub-surface median cracks normal to the <b>machining</b> <b>direction</b> were clearly identified in bar cross-sections using oblique, diffuse "penumbra" illumination in an optical microscope, an as yet undocumented technique. Cross-section views of the machined surface and sub-surface were made possible by the very difficult and delicate technique of producing sandwich cross-sections of the machined bars. An analysis of machining-induced median cracks has not been carried out in such detail before. Semi-elliptical in shape the median cracks extend from 6 mum - 45 mum below the machined surface, and range from 19 mum to 101 mum in length parallel to the <b>machining</b> <b>direction.</b> They initiate at the focal point of a tributary system of microcracks at an average depth of 4 mum - 5 mum below the machined surface. It is believed that the median cracks initiate at the plastic/elastic boundary of a plastically deformed surface layer. Therefore a residual compressive layer, formed by the overlap of localised residual stresses from multi-particle contact events. and bound by an underlying tensile field, is thought to have an average depth of 4 mum - 5 mum. A very innovative technique was used to reveal sub-surface deformation, where TEM X-ray microdiffraction spots were distorted by mechanical damage in the ceramic grain structure. The "arcing" or "streaking" of the diffraction spots tended to disappear at a depth of 4 mum - 5 mum below the machined surface. This is further evidence of the existence of a thin layer in residual compression, which has an average depth of 4 mum - 5 mum. This technique is not known to have been used before. Fine diamond machining with a 600 grit wheel produced a centre line average roughness of 0. 01 / 0. 02 mum. However, evidence of machining damage is still present in the form of "remnant tracks" which lie parallel to the <b>machining</b> <b>direction</b> and consist of material pull-out. They are remnants of machining damage under grinding grooves introduced in previous machining stages. Single point Vickers pyramid diamond scratches were implemented at different loads on a polished surface. The morphology of the grooves and material fragmentation and the sub-surface median cracks were examined. Many features were found to resemble the deformation/fracture formed under a deep grinding groove in the coarse machined surface. Work carried out at Rolls-Royce by R Quinn showed that an increase in the quality of surface finish is accompanied by an increase in the mean strength and Weibull modulus of the machined bars. Furthermore a distinct anisotropy in the fracture strengths parallel and normal to the "coarse" <b>machining</b> <b>direction</b> is evidence of anisotropy in machining damage formed by a peripheral diamond grinding wheel. X-ray diffraction tests carried out at the CEGB by P E J Flewitt showed that machining damage produces a long range biaxial residual compressive field with the highest component acting normal to the <b>machining</b> <b>direction.</b> These results are consistent with the nature of machining damage identified at the University of Surrey, namely the strength-controlling median cracks which lie parallel to the <b>machining</b> <b>direction</b> and the residual compressive stress which exists as a thin 4 mum - 5 mum layer below the machined surface. Processing flaws were discovered in the as-hipped billets received for the project. Their elemental composition and likely origin were examined. A three dimensional "cellular network" flaw ranging from 400 mum to 2. 1 mm in size (in different production batches) {{is believed to have been}} formed as a result of flocculation clustering during processing. Clusters of 1 mum - 3 mum metallic particles were also identified. They range from 5 mum - 45 mum in size. The contaminant particles are steel and were introduced as a result of the original ceramic powder ball milling process which employed a steel ball mill...|$|R

50|$|The rolls {{are usually}} placed with their roll {{directions}} oriented up-and-down slope, rather than along (or parallel to) them.

There can be no geotextile sandwiched within this overlap area.|$|E

For the machining of an active tool surface, two technological processes are used: electrical discharge machining and high-speed milling.

Practical experience shows that the milling strategy has a big influence on the durability of a forging tool.
