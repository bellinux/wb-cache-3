Following several intermediate phases under various names (Aldebaran, Niobe, and Schwalbe), including one as a charter ship for a film company, she was purchased in 1922 by the German navy which selected her new name Niobe after the mythological daughter of Tantalus, and converted her into a three-mast barque to train future officers and non-commissioned officers. The previous training vessels, Grossherzog Friedrich August and Prinzess Eitel Friedrich, had been seized by the Allies as war reparations.|$|E
5000|$|A Schachtpinge ("shaft pinge") is a {{particular}} type of Pinge caused by the collapsing of old surface mineshafts. Especially {{in the early days of}} mining, very many smaller mineshafts were sunk. The shafts were predominantly lined with <b>mine</b> <b>timber.</b> Only in rare cases was natural stone, brick or concrete used for this purpose. If these wells were then abandoned, the wooden lining rotted over the years, fell away and then the pit collapsed, leading to the formation of a Schachtpinge. [...] The diameter and depth of a Schachtpinge depends on the size of the shafts, and whether the shaft had been filled in and the quality of the infill. Another cause for the emergence of a Schachtpinge was so-called Duckelbau mining. In this type of mining, the overburden in the area of the shaft usually collapsed very quickly, because ore was dug out just a few metres below the surface and, in most cases, not in solid rock.|$|E
50|$|Shorea astylosa is {{a species}} of plant in the Dipterocarpaceae family. It is endemic to the Philippines, which is known as yakal in Filipino language.Yakal is a medium to large tree about 25 to 30 meters tall.Its wood is hard and dark brownish-yellow.Branchlets are rather slender, blackish, and {{slightly}} hairy.Leaves are coriaceous, ovate to lanceolate or oblong-lanceolate or apex acuminate; the base is rounded to cuneate, glabrous above, and slightly hairy underneath. Its blade is 6.5-nine centimeters long and two-4.5 centimeters wide. The petiole is slender, 10-23 millimeters long, and dark.Inflorescence are axilllary, paniculate, and up to about six centimeters long. The flowers of yakal are yellow, very short-stalked, and about 12 millimeters long. Petals narrowly oblong or oblong-lanceolate, more or less twisted in bud, rounded at apex, 18 millimeters long, and reticulate.LocationsYakal is commonly found in Luzon, particularly Quezon and Camarines; Samar; Negros; and Mindanao, particularly Zamboanga, Agusan, and Davao. It {{can also be found}} in primary forests at low altitudes.Traditional useWood extractions are tumor-inhibiting.Contemporary useYakal is used for high-grade construction, bridges and wharves, <b>mine</b> <b>timber,</b> and other installations requiring high strength and durability.|$|E

40|$|Assortment {{structure}} in beech coppice stands was {{studied in the}} area of Boljevac. Assortment structure was evaluated according to the articles of the valid standard (JUS). The assortments represented in the assortment structure, based on the stemwood quality are: Logs for matches, sawlogs I II and III classes, <b>mine</b> <b>timber,</b> technical roundwood, pulpwood, wood for excelsior and fuelwood, I and II classes. The results of the analyses show that the value assortment structure (sum of the values of assortments produced from one tree) grows significantly with the increase of tree diameter and this dependence is presented by a degree function. The value percentage of logs for matches, sawlogs of the I and II classes, technical roundwood, <b>mine</b> <b>timber,</b> fuelwood and pulpwood, grows with the increase of the tree diameter. The occurrence of better quality logs (sawlogs) in these stands, in contrast to the beech coppice stand {{in the area of}} Crni Vrh results from the more favourable diameter structure. There are no statistically significant differences between the value assortment structure on the established sample plot series within the same locality, consequently the data ere united. Because of the differences in stand age, the data are not unified for the localities, although there are no statistically significant differences between value assortment structure for diameter degrees represented in them. False heart (red heart) is one of very significant defects of beech wood, and its incidence, inter alia, depends on tree age. The low effect of this defect of wood resulted in a significant percentage of logs for matches. Along with the value assortment structure this paper also presents the percentage of assortments depending on tree diameter...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMine {{fires are}} the major {{disasters}} in process of coal production, and the mine timbers {{that can lead to}} fires are still significant hazard sources. For timber fires, thermal decomposition provides the necessary fuels for combustion in gas phase. To investigate the thermal decomposition kinetics of the <b>mine</b> <b>timber,</b> a typical timber is taken as experimental sample in this paper. TG and DTG techniques are carried out at different heating rates. Physical, chemical and thermal effect changes are analyzed according to the pyrolysis process. As temperature increases, the timber pyrolysis process shows four phases with varied physicochemical properties and heat effect. Two-phase and first-order thermal kinetic models for the decomposition of mine timbers are advanced, and the kinetic parameters are obtained. Those researches are benefit to understanding the ignition mechanism and flame spreading of timber fires in coal mines...|$|E

40|$|In {{abandoned}} coal mines, methanogenic archaea {{are responsible}} for the production of substantial amounts of methane. The present study aimed to directly unravel the active methanogens mediating methane release as well as active bacteria potentially involved in the trophic network. Therefore, the stable-isotope-labeled precursors of methane, [13 C]acetate and H 2 - 13 CO 2, were fed to liquid cultures from hard coal and <b>mine</b> <b>timber</b> from a coal mine in Germany. Guided by methane production rates, samples for DNA stable-isotope probing (SIP) with subsequent quantitative PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoretic (DGGE) analyses were taken over 6 months. Surprisingly, the formation of [13 C]methane was linked to acetoclastic methanogenesis in both the [13 C]acetate- and the H 2 - 13 CO 2 -amended cultures of coal and timber. H 2 - 13 CO 2 was used mainly by acetogens related to Pelobacter acetylenicus and Clostridium species. Active methanogens, closely affiliated with Methanosarcina barkeri, utilized the readily available acetate rather than the thermodynamically more favorable hydrogen. Thus, the methanogenic microbial community appears to be highly adapted to the low-H 2 conditions found in coal mines...|$|E
