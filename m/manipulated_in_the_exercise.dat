40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationships between perceptions of personal capabilities and intrinsic interest for exercise participation. In the context of formerly sedentary middle-aged adults enrolled in a program of aerobic exercise, {{the role played by}} multidimensional intrinsic interest for exercise in the generation of self-efficacy when statistically controlling for initial efficacy, physiological status, and previous exercise behavior was determined. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that the dimensions of perceived competence and effort contributed significant unique variance to subsequent self-efficacy. The results are discussed in terms of how sources of efficacy enhancing information might be <b>manipulated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> environment to best facilitate perceptions of personal capabilities for exercise in older males and females. Physical activity and fitness have been identified as priority areas in general health promotion as well as specific objectives for the nation’s health (U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1990). As the older U. S. population continues to increase in size, it is well accepted that although individuals may live longer lives, they may not necessarily lead more active, happy, or independent lives. Thus improving the functional independence of aging Americans has become an important priority (Katz, 1983). Although exercise and physical activity appear to be key ingredients in healthy aging both physically and emotionally (Camacho, Roberts, Lazarus, Kaplan, & Cohen, 1991), less than one half of the U. S. adult population exercis...|$|E

Overall, these exercises give students an introduction to some key aspects of conducting empirical research <b>in</b> macroeconomics, including <b>manipulating</b> models into a form that can be estimated and gathering and <b>manipulating</b> data. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> <b>exercises</b> provide students with useful spreadsheet skills {{that can be used}} in other assignments and other arenas, long after graduation.
