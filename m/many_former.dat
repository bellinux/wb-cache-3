5|$|The {{counterculture}} of the 1960s had rapidly {{declined by}} {{the start of}} the 1970s, in large part due to the collapse of the commune movement, but it would be <b>many</b> <b>former</b> members of the counter-culture and hippie subculture who subsequently became early adherents of the New Age movement.|$|E
5|$|Around 120,000 {{men were}} mobilised during the conflict, and of these about 3,500 were killed. In the end, the victorious {{imperial}} faction abandoned its objective to expel foreigners from Japan and instead adopted {{a policy of}} continued modernization {{with an eye to}} eventual renegotiation of the Unequal Treaties with the Western powers. Due to the persistence of Saigō Takamori, a prominent leader of the imperial faction, the Tokugawa loyalists were shown clemency, and <b>many</b> <b>former</b> shogunate leaders and samurai were later given positions of responsibility under the new government.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, most of Mayfair {{was built}} on with prestigious housing to suit the upper class; unlike some nearby areas of London, it has never lost its {{affluent}} status. The decline of the British aristocracy in the early 20th century led to Mayfair becoming more commercial instead of residential, with <b>many</b> <b>former</b> homes converted into offices for major corporate headquarters, embassies and other businesses. There remains a substantial quantity of luxury residential property, upmarket shops and restaurants, and modern hotels along Piccadilly and Park Lane in particular. Mayfair's prestigious status has been commemorated by being the most expensive property square on the London Monopoly board.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Whig Party in the early 1850s, <b>many</b> <b>former</b> Whigs joined the Know Nothing, or American, Party, and Charles S. Morehead was elected governor from that party in 1855. Sectarian tensions gripped the state in the lead-up to the Civil War, and while the majority of Kentuckians favored the preservation of the Union above all else, a self-constituted group of Confederate sympathizers met at Russellville and formed a Confederate government for the state. While this provisional government never displaced the elected government in Frankfort, two men served as Confederate governors of Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>former</b> US Highways in Michigan {{have left}} an M-numbered highway {{with the same}} number as a relic of their existence. For example, M-27 runs along a portion of former US27. In addition, there are two occurrences of {{original}} M-numbered state routes which became US Highways with the same designations: all of M-16 became US16 and most of M-10 from Detroit to Saginaw was assumed into the route of US10 in 1926. In fact, each iteration of M-10 has existed in whole or part along a former or future alignment of US10.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>former</b> {{adherents of}} the Fasci left Sicily. Life had grown hard and {{employment}} {{difficult to find}} because of their involvement with the movement. For those in Sicily who wanted to change their life for the better in those days, {{there were only two}} alternatives: rebel or emigrate. After the failure of the rebellion many peasants {{had no choice but to}} vote with their feet and opted for emigration. Others remained, and a year later, in 1895, protests against unjust taxes and about the issue of communal land resumed in many towns in Sicily. The disbandment of troop had to be postponed.|$|E

5|$|Schmeisser helped {{organize}} and {{played on the}} Mount Washington Lacrosse Club, a highly successful Baltimore-based amateur team.

In 1904, Schmeisser and Abercrombie co-authored Lacrosse: From Candidate to Team, a book which became the sport's standard text for the next fifty years. He also helped promote lacrosse at the University of Maryland and the Naval Academy.|$|E
5|$|The Council of Indigenous Peoples {{consider}} several limited {{factors in}} a successful formal petition.

The lack of documentation and the extinction of many indigenous languages {{as the result of}} colonial cultural and language policies have made the prospect of official recognition of many ethnicities a remote possibility. Current trends in ethno-tourism have led <b>many</b> <b>former</b> Plains Aborigines to continue to seek cultural revival.|$|E

5|$|The London Underground is {{a public}} rapid transit system in the United Kingdom that serves {{a large part of}} Greater London and the home {{counties}} of Essex, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire.

Many stations were planned as parts of new lines or extensions to existing ones but were later abandoned.|$|E

The artists Gilbert and George have long made their home and workshop in Spitalfields, and the neighbourhood around Hoxton Square has become a centre for modern British art, including the White Cube gallery, with many artists from the Young British Artists movement living and working in the area. This has made the area around Hoxton and Shoreditch fashionable, with <b>many</b> <b>former</b> residents now driven out by higher property prices, and a busy nightlife has developed, with over 80 licensed premises around Shoreditch.|$|E
