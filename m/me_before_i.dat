500|$|The opening track, [...] "Afraid" [...] (featuring rapper Attitude), is a {{description}} of Furtado's fear of what people think of her, and she has said the chorus reminds her of [...] "walking down the hall in high school ... because you live from the outside in. Now that I'm an adult, I care about the inside of <b>me</b> ... <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> said I didn't care about what people thought about me, but I really did." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 1940 Le Mesurier's rented {{home was}} hit by a German bomb, {{destroying}} all his possessions, including his call-up papers. In the same bombing raid, the theatre in Brixton in which he was working was also hit. A few days later he reported for basic training with the Royal Armoured Corps; in June 1941 he was commissioned into the Royal Tank Regiment. He served in Britain until 1943 when he was posted to British India where he {{spent the rest of the}} war. Le Mesurier later claimed that he had had [...] "a comfortable war, with captaincy thrust upon <b>me,</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> was demobbed in 1946".|$|E

[...] Smith went on to Stafford Senior High School, where he played basketball as a guard, and football at several different positions. He enjoys fishing as a pastime.|$|E
500|$|Overall, One Hot Minute lyrically {{confronted the}} dark, melancholy and remorseful {{feelings}} Kiedis kept to himself. Many {{of the songs}} were written {{at a time when}} he was hiding his resumed addiction. [...] "Warped" [...] directly faced Kiedis's distraught moods as a hysterical cry for help: [...] "My tendency for dependency is offending me/It's upending me/I'm pretending to be strong and free from my dependency/It's warping me." [...] He also felt disappointed that [...] "no one had suspected that I'd slipped from my more than five years of sobriety." [...] The track itself was composed of heavy guitar riffs and echoing vocals which attempted to convey a distressed state. [...] "Aeroplane", the album's third single, was more upbeat than many of the album's songs; but it still contained various references to Kiedis's personal issues: [...] "Looking into my own eyes/I can't find the love I want/Someone better slap <b>me</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> start to rust/before I start to decompose." [...] The song also featured Flea's daughter Clara and her kindergarten class singing backing vocals on the last verse.|$|E

5000|$|A further {{limitation}} {{is the possibility}} that what could be classed as embarrassing could also be an intentionally created account designed to provoke a reaction. For instance, Saint Peter's denial of Jesus could have been written {{as an example of the}} consequences of denial. : [...] "Whoever acknowledges <b>me</b> <b>before</b> men, <b>I</b> will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns <b>me</b> <b>before</b> men, <b>I</b> will disown him before my Father in heaven." ...|$|R
500|$|The young Stanford {{was given}} a {{conventional}} education at a private day school in Dublin run by Henry Tilney Bassett, who concentrated on the classics {{to the exclusion of}} other subjects. Stanford's parents encouraged the boy's precocious musical talent, employing a succession of teachers in violin, piano, organ and composition. Three of his teachers were former pupils of Ignaz Moscheles, including his godmother Elizabeth Meeke, of whom Stanford recalled, [...] "She taught <b>me,</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> was twelve years old, to read at sight. ... She made me play every day {{at the end of my}} lesson a Mazurka of Chopin: never letting me stop for a mistake. ... By the time I had played through the whole fifty-two Mazurkas, I could read most music of the calibre my fingers could tackle with comparative ease." [...] One of the young Stanford's earliest compositions, a march in D major, written when he was eight years old, was performed in the pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Dublin three years later. At the age of seven, Stanford gave a piano recital for an invited audience, playing works by Beethoven, Handel, Mendelssohn, Moscheles, Mozart and Bach. One of his songs was taken up by the University of Dublin Choral Society and was well received.|$|E
500|$|Brown's {{trial began}} in Naha on May 26 with {{testimony}} from V. N.. Over {{the next three}} days of testimony, V. N. repeatedly stated that Brown was innocent and that she wanted to withdraw her complaint. She said that any contact between her and Brown on the night in question was consensual and that she allowed Brown to fondle and kiss her breasts. At that point, V. N. said, she began to resist and Brown became angry. V. N. testified that when she threatened to call police, Brown threw her cell phone into the [...] river. Angry at the loss of her cell phone, V. N. stated that she then embellished the story when she told it to the guards at the Courtney main gate. V. N. further claimed that she had been coerced by police, prosecutors and her employer, a local agency that provides temporary workers for USMC bases on Okinawa, to file the charges. She said that once the charges were filed, Japanese prosecutors told her she could only withdraw the charges in court. One of the Naha judges then asked V. N. why she was not angry at Brown to which V. N. replied, [...] "Because he didn't attempt to rape <b>me.</b> <b>Before,</b> <b>I</b> was angry at him for throwing away my cell phone. But not now." ...|$|E

O father, I have got {{knowledge}} which you have not, so follow me. I will guide you to a straight path." [...] His father replied angrily: [...] "Do you reject my gods, O Ibrahim?

"Having labored now twenty years, {{the best}} ones of my life, in {{dispensing}} at retail, as the saying goes, at the demand of everyone, that little talent in my profession that God and my own efforts have given me, my desires would truly be to obtain enough leisure and quiet as would enable <b>me</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> die to complete three great works that I have in hand {{in order to be}} able to publish them, perhaps with some praise for me and for whoever has helped me in the business. ... It is not possible to receive a salary from a Republic, however splendid and generous, without serving the public, because to get something from the public one must satisfy it and not just one particular person; and while I remain able to teach and to serve, no one can exempt me from the burden while leaving me the income; and in sum I cannot hope for such a benefit from anyone but an absolute prince." ...|$|E
