40|$|Pulli kolam is a {{ubiquitous}} {{art form}} in south India. It involves drawing a line looped around {{a collection of}} dots (pullis) place on a plane such that three mandatory rules are followed: all line orbits should be closed, all dots are encircled and no two lines can overlap over a finite length. The mathematical foundation for this art form has attracted attention over the years. In this work, we propose a simple 5 -step topological method by which one can systematically draw all possible kolams {{for any number of}} dots N arranged in any spatial configuration on a surface.

40|$|The {{decision}} making capacity of patients will acquire special relevance {{with the introduction}} of informed consent in clinical practice and the new normative that will appear in the future when the bills about health services are approved in the Congress. This paper reviews the concept of {{decision making}} capacity in the context of health care and its legal background in Chile. The main problems that arise from the comprehension, use and assessment of decision making capacity, are analyzed. The assessment of this capacity is, in most cases, subjective since there are no criteria, protocols or standards to be used. In courts of justice, the «exercise capacity» assessment is requested to experts. These specialized physicians will evaluate the mental health of the subject and its implications in the capacity to make decisions. In practice, it is difficult to integrate the concept of capacity from the law or health care perspective. It is concluded that the elaboration of criteria, standards and procedures to evaluate the decision capacity of patients, is <b>mandatory</b> (Rev <b>Méd</b> Chile 2004; 132 : 1243 - 8...|$|R

Rotating the (m, k) -patterns of single tasks by a spin value can improve feasibility of task sets. Due to minor errors and missing information in the original presentation of this approach, a reproduction of these results is difficult. In this report we provide the necessary corrections. Our evaluation shows that, after applying these corrections, the original results can be reproduced...|$|R

The patient underwent emergency surgery with exploratory laparotomy, repeated procedures of debridement, and reconstructive abdominal wall surgery with skin graft. He recovered 6 months after admission. We also {{address the issue}} of the closure of large abdominal wall defect and the importance of alimentation in this patient group. We discuss the need to recognize necrotizing fasciitis as a potential complication of intra-abdominal disease, as once necrotizing fasciitis occurs, mortality is more likely.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} complex alleles, with two or more mutations in cis position, of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene {{in the definition of}} the genotype-phenotype relationship in cystic fibrosis (CF), and to {{evaluate the}} functional significance of the highly controversial L 997 F CFTR mutation. Methods: We evaluated the diagnosis of CF or CFTR-related disorders in 12 unrelated subjects with highly variable phenotypes. According to a first CFTR mutational analysis, subjects appeared to be compound heterozygotes for a classic mutation and the L 997 F mutation. A further CFTR mutational analysis was conducted by means of a protocol of extended sequencing, particularly suited to the detection of complex alleles. Results: We detected a new [R 117 L; L 997 F] CFTR complex allele in the four subjects with the highest sweat test values and CF. The eight subjects without the complex allele showed the most varied biochemical and clinical outcome and were diagnosed as having mild CF, CFTR-related disorders, or even no disease. Conclusions: The new complex allele partially explains the variable phenotype in CF subjects with the L 997 F mutation. CFTR complex alleles are likely to have a role in the definition of the genotype-phenotype relationship in CF. Whenever apparently identical CFTR-mutated genotypes are found in subjects with divergent phenotypes, an extensive mutational search is <b>mandatory.</b> Genet <b>Med</b> 2010 : 12 (9) : 548 - 555...|$|R
40|$|A Minimum <b>Mandatory</b> Metadata Set (<b>M</b> 3 S) was devised for the KIM (Knowledge and Information Management Through Life) Project {{to address}} two challenges. The first was {{to ensure the}} project’s {{documents}} were sufficiently self-documented {{to allow them to}} be preserved in the long term. The second was to trial the M 3 S and supporting templates and tools as a possible approach that might be used by the aerospace, defence and construction industries. A different M 3 S was devised along similar principles by a later project called REDm-MED (Research Data Management for Mechanical Engineering Departments). The aim this time was to help specify a tool for documenting research data records and the associations between them, in support of both preservation and discovery. In both cases the emphasis was on collecting a minimal set of metadata at the time of object creation, on the understanding that later processes would be able to expand the set into a full metadata record...|$|R
40|$|This report {{concerns}} {{implementation of}} the buffer zones in the countryside of Denmark and to what extend it leaves room for incorporation of local knowledge. The surface water bodies in Europe {{are in need of}} remediation toward minimizing the emission of nutrients and pesticides. Through water quality goals set by the European Union Water Framework Directive (EU WFD) the Danish government has implemented River Basin Management Plans, wherein <b>mandatory</b> 10 <b>m</b> buffer zones along all open watercourses and lakes larger than 100 m 2 in the countryside has been chosen as one of the legal measures to ensure the decrease of these outlets. The conversion of farmland into buffer zones has been legislated uniformly by the government with a minimum amount of inclusion of local knowledge and this has spurred a lot of debate in regard to its legitimacy and its efficiency toward complying with the goals set in the EU WFD. To assist in shedding light on the possibilities and barriers of utilization of local knowledge in the buffer zone legislation Martin Jänicke’s theory about environmental capacity is used as theoretical background. A case study of the municipality of Horsens is analysed through Jänicke’s model of environmental explanation and empirical data consisting of background material regarding the buffer zone legislation and interviews with the municipality of Horsens, the local agricultural consultancy agency (LRØ), and two farmers from the area Horsens are used in order to answer our problem formulation. The findings of this report show that there are more barriers than possibilities to the inclusion of local knowledge in the BZL and that these barriers are primarily found in the political-institutional realm. Furthermore this study shows that actors in Horsens possess local knowledge which can be used in future water planning. ...|$|R

40|$|Hemangiopericytoma (HPC) {{is a rare}} tumor of {{the central}} nervous system and is usually found intracranially. Intraspinal HPCs are very rare and mostly involve the {{extradural}} bony structures. Primary intradural HPC has only been reported in 10 cases, all of which occurred in the extramedullary region. Intramedullary invasion has never been reported. Here, we describe a case of primary intradural HPC of the thoracic spine that presented initially with paresthesia and paraplegia of both legs. Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine showed an intradural dumbbell-shaped tumor at the T 10 level. The initial impression was neurogenic tumor, meningioma, or metastasis. During operation, the tumor was found to have obvious intramedullary invasion. Gross-total removal was done, and the patient's neurological function improved; there was no recurrence at the 3 -year follow-up. There is no consensus as to what constitutes the optimal treatment of HPC, but most neurosurgeons will advocate gross-total resection. A comparative analysis between intradural and extradural HPCs showed a higher chance of gross-total resection for intradural HPCs, while the recurrence rates showed no difference. The role of adjuvant radiotherapy remains uncertain. Due to the high risk of recurrence and metastasis of HPCs, close follow-up for a long period is <b>mandatory.</b> [J Chin <b>Med</b> Assoc 2009; 72 (10) : 536 – 541...|$|R
40|$|Titanium dioxide {{occurs as}} {{particles}} of various sizes. Particles {{of up to}} 100 nm, corresponding to nanoparticles, and in the size range of 0. 1 – 3 mm are the most frequently used. Titanium dioxide in a bulk form is not classified as dangerous substance, nevertheless nanoparticles may cause adverse health effects. Inhalation exposure to nano-TiO 2 causes pulmonary inflammation {{that may lead to}} fibrotic and proliferative changes in the lungs. Many studies confirm the genotoxic effect of TiO 2, especially in the form of nanoparticles, on mammal and human cells. In rats exposed to TiO 2 -nanoparticles by inhalation the development of tumors has been observed. However, {{there is no evidence of}} additional lung cancer risk or mortality in workers exposed to TiO 2 dust. There are some studies demonstrating the adverse effect of TiO 2 -nanoparticles on fetal development, as well as on reproduction of animals. TiO 2 nanoparticles find a still wider application and thus the risk of occupational exposure to this substance increases as well. Considering such alarming data on the biological activity of TiO 2 nanoparticles, more attention should be paid to occupational exposure and its health effects. Properties of the nanoparticles, due to their larger surface area and reactivity, differ significantly from the inhalable dust of TiO 2, for which the hygiene standards are <b>mandatory</b> in Poland. <b>Med</b> Pr 2014; 65 (5) : 651 – 663...|$|R
