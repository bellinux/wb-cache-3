She was criticized because the child was 5-year-old Raja Abu Shaban, who was killed in 2006 when she fell from a swing, and not in an Israeli attack. Badawi later tweeted that she mistakenly had tweeted an old photo. Ma'an News Agency {{reported}} the hospital medical report on the dead girl stated she died [...] "due to falling from a high area during the Israeli strike on Gaza". Interviews with relatives, news reports and investigations by human rights organizations also suggest that her death indirectly was caused by an Israeli air strike as little as 100 meters away, though accounts differ on how this occurred. Israeli officials have said that the girl's death {{had nothing to do with}} Israel.|$|E

On 1 October 2011, protesters set out to march across the Brooklyn Bridge. The New York Times reported that more than 700 arrests were made. Some said the police had tricked protesters, allowing them onto the bridge, and even escorting them partway across. Jesse A. Myerson, a <b>media</b> <b>coordinator</b> for Occupy Wall Street said, [...] "The cops watched and did nothing, indeed, seemed to guide us onto the roadway." [...] A spokesman for the New York Police Department, Paul Browne, said that protesters were given multiple warnings to stay on the sidewalk and not block the street, and were arrested when they refused.|$|E

Research has provided the link between school library media personnel and programs and a high quality education. School library media program areas {{included in this study}} were staffing, expenditures, size and age of the collection, and instructional resources and technology. District as well as building-level media personnel are positioned to assist students in developing the information literacy skills {{to meet the demands of}} the twenty-first century. ^ This dissertation investigated the relationship between school library media program areas and academic achievement on the End of Grade Reading Test and the Computer Skills Test, compared the school library media program areas in middle schools with district media personnel and middle school without such a position and examined the leadership and support provided by district media personnel on school library media program areas as perceived by principals, building-level <b>media</b> <b>coordinators</b> and district <b>media</b> personnel. ^ Data was obtained from a research sample of 97 principals, building-level <b>media</b> <b>coordinators</b> and district <b>media</b> personnel in 121 middle schools. An assessment document called the System-level Leadership and Support Rubrics (2000) was used to collect data. Additional data collected by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction were used to examine and compare the school library media program areas. ^ The findings indicated a significant relationship between the End of Grade Reading Test scores, the Computer Skills Test scores, and the school library media program area of staffing. There were significant differences in school library media program areas of expenditures, collection size, software, computers and resources between middle schools with district media personnel and middle schools without such a position. The perceptions of leadership and support provided by district media personnel was rated as outstanding in three of the four school library media program areas. ...|$|R

The project, involving responses from library media specialists (LMSs) from 24 DeKalb secondary schools (5 junior high schools and 19 high school), sought answers to the following research questions: (1) Is the amount budgeted per school for CLASSMATE online searching adequate? (2) How is online searching being used in each school and with what results? (3) What is the general feeling or perception of the LMSs toward its use? (4) Are more inservices or staff development programs needed in this area for LMSs and/or teachers? and (5) What can be done at the district level to enhance the use of online searching for the students? Overall, the report reveals that LMSs had a positive attitude toward online searching. Responses to the questionnaire, however, indicate improvements are needed in training LMSs and teachers in online service usage. The CLASSMATE Online Searching questionnaire and cover letter are appended. (GLR) Reproductions supplied by EDRS are the best that can be made from the ori. inal document...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn modern politics, {{parties and}} {{individual}} candidates {{must have an}} online presence and usually have dedicated social <b>media</b> <b>coordinators.</b> In this context, we study the usefulness of analysing Twitter messages to identify both the characteristics of political parties and the political leaning of users. As a case study, we collected the main stream of Twitter related to the 2010 UK General Election during the associated period - gathering around 1, 150, 000 messages from about 220, 000 users. We examined {{the characteristics of the}} three main parties in the election and highlighted the main differences between parties. First, Labour members were the most active and influential during the election while Conservative members were the most organized to promote their activities. Second, the websites and blogs that each political party's members supported are clearly different from those that all the other political parties' members supported. From these observations, we develop a simple and practical classification method which uses the number of Twitter messages referring to a particular political party. The experimental results showed that the proposed classification method achieved about 86 % classifica- tion accuracy and outperforms other classification methods that require expensive costs for tuning classifier parameters and/or knowledge about network topology...|$|R
