40|$|International audienceA {{methodology}} {{for determining the}} thin film hardness from a microindentation loading curve is proposed. The loading curve is modelled to compute the dynamic <b>Martens</b> <b>hardness</b> using the indentation depth reached during the test. Moreover, the indentation size effect is taken into account by applying the strain gradient plasticity theory. Then, the dynamic <b>Martens</b> <b>hardness</b> and the hardness length-scale factor are used to express the applied load {{as a function of}} the indentation depth. The proposed model involves three parameters: (i) the dynamic Martens macro-hardness, equivalent to the hardness obtained for an infinite applied load, (ii) the hardness length-scale factor, which represents the material resistance to plastic deformation under indentation and (iii) a corrective load, considering the rounded tip effect of the indenter and the zero shift.

However, sintering of β-TCP {{is difficult and}} the material presents poor mechanical strength and a low resistance to crack-growth propagation. In this study, influence of the porosity on the hardness and the elastic modulus is studied by means of usual and instrumented microindentation tests. Nevertheless, indentation diagonals measurement by optical observations is not accurate due to the crack formation around the residual indent. That is why instrumented indentation test which allows deducing the hardness and the bulk modulus from the load-depth curve analysis is used as an alternative method. The corresponding hardness number can be calculated by using the maximum indentation depth (<b>Martens</b> <b>Hardness)</b> or the contact depth determined by Oliver and Pharr's method (Contact Hardness). But {{in order to give}} representative values when comparing classical and instrumented hardness measurements, <b>Martens</b> <b>hardness</b> is preferred because its value can be directly related to the value of the Vickers hardness number by simple geometrical considerations.

As main results, the elastic modulus is found decreasing between 166 GPa and 108 GPa and the hardness number from 4. 4 GPa to 2. 2 GPa when increasing the porosity rate.

40|$|Due to the {{influence}} of the substrate, direct measurement of the hardness of thin films by standard micro-indentation tests is not always possible. In such situation, determination of the intrinsic film hardness requires the analysis of a set of experimental apparent hardness values obtained for different indentation loads. A number of mathematical equations based on various assumptions were proposed in literature for that purpose. Most of the models were established on the basis of standard Vickers indentation. Using these models to process the data obtained by Knoop indentation does not provide the same intrinsic hardness value, even after Knoop/Vickers standard conversion, than the one obtained from Vickers indentation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{inorganic}} scaffold of the spicules, {{the skeletal}} {{elements of the}} calcareous sponges, is formed of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). The growth of the approximately 300 -μm large spicules, {{such as those of}} the calcareous sponge Sycon raphanus used in the present study, is a rapid process with a rate of about 65  μm/h. The formation of CaCO 3 is predominantly carried out by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA). The enzyme from the sponge S. raphanus was isolated and prepared by recombination. The CA-driven deposition of CaCO 3 crystallites is dependent on temperature (optimal at 52 °C), the pH value of the reaction assay (7. 5 / 8. 0), and the substrate concentration (CO 2 and Ca 2 +). During the initial phase of crystallite formation, ≈ 40  μm large round-shaped deposits are formed that remodel to larger prisms. These crystal-like prisms associate to each other and form either rope-/bundle-like aggregates or arrange perfectly with their smaller planes along opposing surfaces of the sponge spicule rays. The CA-dependent CaCO 3 deposition can be inhibited by the CA-specific inhibitor acetazolamide. The Michaelis–Menten constant for the CA-driven mineralization has been determined to be around 8  mM with respect to CaCO 3. The deposits formed have a <b>Martens</b> <b>hardness</b> of ≈ 5  GPa.

In hard materials a "sinking-in" type deformation is observed during indentation and the contact area for such materials is usually calculated using the methodology proposed by Oliver and Pharr [1]. However, in softer materials, "piling-up" instead of "sinking-in" occurs along the edges of the residual indent and, in this case, the methodology proposed by Hochstetter et al. [2] is appropriate. In this work, the above methods proposed by Oliver and Pharr [1] and Hochstetter et al. [2] have been applied for characterizing the mechanical properties of austenitic stainless steel and another stainless steel consolidated using direct metal laser sintering, respectively. These two materials have shown different modes of deformation around the indent. While piling-up has occurred for the commercial stainless steel, sinking-in has been observed {{in the case of the}} laser sintered samples.

Twenty-seven bovine dentin slabs were restored with three adhesive systems: Adper Single Bond 2 total-etch adhesive system, One Up Bond F and Clearfil SE Protect fluoride-containing self-etching adhesive systems. The restorations were made with Filtek Z 250. The HMV and Eit values at distances of 10, 30, 50 and 70 µm from the interface were evaluated using a dynamic ultra microhardness tester before and after immersion in deionized water, citric acid and hydrochloric acid (n= 9).

For dentin restored with Adper Single Bond 2, the lowest values were found closer to the hybrid layer, while for One Up Bond F and Clearfil SE Protect, the values remained unaltered at all distances. For dentin restored with fluoride-releasing adhesive systems, a decrease in Eit was found, but after 30 µm this difference was not significant. The acid substances were able to alter HMV and Eit of the underlying dentin. For fluoride-releasing adhesives, the greater the distance from bonded interface, the lower the Eit values. The fluoride in One Up Bond F and Clearfil SE Protect was able to protect the underlying dentin closer to the materials. In this way, the fluoride from adhesive systems could have some positive effect in the early stages of erosive lesions...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of chemical composition and isothermal heating {{in order to determine the}} change of the mechanical properties of the metallic ribbons by depth sensing indentation technique. Design/methodology/approach: The amorphous metallic ribbons were manufactured by planar-flow-casting method. Instrumented hardness measuring was carried out using the nanohardness tester DUH- 202 with a Vickers indenter. Observations of the structure of powders were made on the OPTON DSM- 940 scanning electron microscope. The diffraction examinations and examinations of thin foils were made on the JEOL JEM 3010 transmission electron microscope. Findings: The analysis of the mechanical properties and structure of the Co-based amorphous ribbons obtained in the by planar-flow-casting process proved that the no significant differences between both ternary alloys in local mechanical properties HM, EIT and W were observed for amorphous state but differences between ternary and multicomponent alloys were observed. In heat treated state small differences between materials were observed too. Research limitations/implications: For the metallic Co-based amorphous ribbons, further mechanical examinations and structure are planed. Practical implications: Feature an alternative to commercial alloys and composite materials are the amorphous and nanocrystalline metal amorphous ribbons obtained by melt spinning technique and make it possible to obtain the new composite materials with best mechanical properties, whose dimensions and shape can be freely formed.

40|$|State of Problem: Flexural strength, hardness, surface roughness, {{discoloration}} and abrasion stability {{are important}} properties of veneering composites. The second-generation of veneering composite systems {{are said to}} have enhanced mechanical properties due to their composition. Purpose of study: This study tested and compared the impact of aging on three different veneering composites. Material and methods: Indirect composites: GC Gradia, VITA VM LC and Sinfony, were prepared for flexural strength (N= 495; n= 165 per composite), <b>Martens</b> <b>hardness</b> (N= 30, n= 10 per composite), surface roughness (N= 30, n= 10 per composite), discoloration measurement (N= 90, n= 30 per composite) and abrasion stability (N= 18, n= 6 per composite). After the initial flexural strength was measured, half of all remaining specimens were stored in water and the other half was subjected to thermocycling for 1, 7, 28, 90 or 180 days. Hardness and surface roughness (water stored: n= 5 of each composite und thermocycling: n= 5 of each composite) were tested before and after 1, 7, 28, 90, and 180 days aging. The discoloration specimens were randomly divided in three groups (coffee: n= 10 per composite, black tea: n= 10 per composite and red wine: n= 10 per composite), aged and discoloration was measured. Abrasion stability was determined after 120 000, 240 000, 640 000 and 1 200 000 cycles in the chewing simulator. Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA followed by a post-hoc Scheffé test and t-test. The longitudinal observations were analysed using linear mixed models (alpha= 0. 05). Results: In summary, when considering all 10 tested different properties Sinfony revealed the best results (5 positive assessements) followed by GC Gradia (2 positive, 1 negative) and VITA VM LC (2 positive, 3 negative). Conclusion: The veneering composite Sinfony showed the most stable tested properties...|$|E
40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) {{can be used}} {{to support}} fixed dental prostheses. However, {{information}} about physicomechanical characterization is still scarce. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to assess effects of different aging regimens/durations on roughness, solubility, water absorption, <b>Martens</b> <b>hardness</b> (HM), and indentation modulus/EIT on different computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) polymers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty standardized specimens of the following materials were fabricated: PEEK: Dentokeep (DK); hybrid material: VITA Enamic (EN); composite resins: LAVA Ultimate (LU) and an experimental CAD/CAM nanohybrid-composite resin (EX); poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) -based: VITA CAD-Temp (CT); Telio CAD (TC), artBloc Temp (AT), and ZENOTEC ProFix (ZP). A nanofilled-polymer for interim restorations, Protemp 4 (CG), served as the control group. Specimens were stored in sodium chloride, artificial saliva, physiological saliva, and distilled water at 37 °C for 1, 7, 14, 28, 90, and 180 days. Roughness, water absorption, HM, and EIT were investigated after each storage period; solubility was determined after 180 days only. Data were analyzed using weighted 3 / 2 / 1 -way ANOVA and the post hoc Scheffé tests (α=. 05). RESULTS: Storage media had no effect on surface roughness and water absorption. Physiological saliva revealed the highest significant impact on solubility followed by artificial saliva, sodium chloride, and distilled water. Water absorption increased significantly with storage duration. PEEK showed the lowest solubility and water absorption values. The highest solubility was observed for the conventional polymer CG, and the highest water absorption was found for the composite LU. PMMA-based TC, ZP, CG, and AT showed the lowest HM and indentation modulus, followed by CT, and PEEK. The highest values were observed for the hybrid material EN, followed by LU and EX. CONCLUSIONS: The hardness parameters of PEEK were comparable with those of PMMA-based materials...|$|E
40|$|Edentulous {{persons have}} been {{reported}} as 'oral invalids and very handicapped' in masticatory function. These patients are usually older people and can be successfully restored with implant-retained prostheses (IRP). However, {{a high rate of}} wear is apparent on the artificial teeth in IRP and opposing dentures necessitating prostheses to be remade partially or in total. Such maintenance has considerable clinical and laboratory cost implications, since it forms 1 '. an increasing part of dentists' workload. The study investigated the wear rates among Various artificial tooth materials when subject to forces that represented those experienced in the clinical situation. The effect of abrasive slurry on the rate of wear was also investigated, as were the changes in hardness when artificial teeth were stored in food simulating solvents. A series of experiments was carried out in order to investigate these parameters on four commercially available Vivodent (VIV), Postaris (Del), Orthosit (aRT), Candulor (paR), and two experimental denture tooth materials; Experimental 1 (EXP 1) and Experimental 2 (EXP 2). Perspex (PER) was used as a control material. Two-body wear test A multi station wear-testing machine was constructed and used to test standardised hemispherical specimens against flat ones and measure the amount of wear using a non-contacting laser profiler to determine the depth of wear scar. Different material combinations were tested including materials worn against themselves and against hemispherical steatite abraders. Measurements were made following 2000 cycles and 10, 000 cycles. Wearrates were determined as mean cross sectional area of the scar (Ilm/ 1 000 cycles). The results of this work revealed some interesting observations. Not all the specimens showed the classical wear pattern by creating a wear track on the flat specimen when the hemispherical abrader was sliding against it. Instead, in some material combinations there was a positive build up of material along the track and therefore a simple quantitative measurement of wear was not possible on all the specimens. The materials with a positive build up demonstrated an adhesive type of wear rather than the abrC?sive wear, which were further analysed under SEM. A technique was developed to measure wear occurring on hemispherical abraders. These were also qualitatively analysed under tool makers microscope and SEM. Abrasive and adhesive wear processes were noticed depending on the material combination tested. Three-body wear test Three-body abrasive wear tests were carried out on flat specimens using a toothbrushing machine with abrasive slurry. A laser profiler was used to measure the depth of wear scar. Measurements were made following 10, 000 cycles except in porcelain specimens where measurements could only be recorded after 100, 000 cycles. Wear rates were determined as mean depth mm/l 000 cycles. POR, EXPl and ORT demonstrated significantly (P< 0. 5) lower three-body wear rate when compared to the other materials. There {{was no significant difference in}} the wear rates between PER, VIV, DeL, and EXP 2. Similarly, there was no significant difference between POR, EXPl and ORT. Effect of solvent storage on hardness The materials were tested for <b>Martens</b> <b>Hardness</b> measurements (HM) aHer storage in peppermint oil. 75 % ethanol and heptane. Distilled water was used as a control storage medium. One specimen from each material group was stored in each solvent for 1 minute. 5 minutes. I hour. 24 hours. 1 week and 1 month respectively. One specimen from each group was also tested dry to establish the baseline HM value. One-way ANOVA using Tukey's test on polymer based materials showed that the hardness of ORT and EXP 1 was significantly higher than the PMMA, Del and EXP 2 (P<O. 05). Moreover. EXPl had a significantly higher hardness value than ORT (P<O. 05). Regression analysis showed that the polymer based materials showed a significant drop in hardness aHer storage in 75 % ethanol (p<O. 05). Specimens stored in water, heptane and peppermint oil showed minor fluctuations in hardness, which were not of statistical significance. Regression analysis performed on polymer-based materials between three-body wear resistance and hardness showed a statistically significant correlation (p<O. 05). Conclusions The two-bOdy wear characteristics of some polymer-based materials when worn against themselves demonstrated a complex pattern of wear and quantitative measurement of wear scar in these specimens was not possible due to the positive build-up of material. It may be more important to describe the type of wear rather than the amount of wear occurring in some of the materials. The information from the wear characteristics is clinically relevant and should inform the clinician in choosing a material combination with better clinical performance. The three-body wear resistance of EXP 1 and ORT is significantly greater than other polymer based materials. EXP 1 is significantly harder than other polymer based denture teeth and storage in ethanol leads to significant reduction in hardness in all materials except POR. EXPI and ORT have significantly better three-body wear resistance than other polymer-based materials tested. There is correlation between hardness and resistance to three-body wear in the selected polymer-based materials. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
