5|$|According to Stephen Shaw, most of <b>Mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Siths {{content was}} {{inspired}} by Timothy Zahn's Thrawn trilogy of books; one of the game's protagonists, Mara Jade, was drawn directly from the novels. Though the expansion includes characters from the previous game, new dialogue was recorded for <b>Mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Siths scenario, including recurring background characters who speak similar lines to their counterparts in Dark Forces II. Some dialogue was authentically translated into Huttese, a fictional language used in Return of the Jedi {{and elsewhere in the}} Star Wars universe. The Star Wars original soundtrack by John Williams is used in <b>Mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sith.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sith is {{primarily}} a first-person shooter, but offers {{the choice of a}} third-person view. Unlike Dark Forces II, where the player's actions within the game dictate whether the story ends with the light side or the dark side ending, <b>Mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sith has a single, morally positive course. The player progresses through the game in a linear fashion; there are fourteen levels and each has set objectives that the player must complete before being able to continue to the next level. Within each level the player can encounter both hostile and non-hostile non-player characters (NPCs). As well as including some enemies that featured in Dark Forces II, <b>Mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sith adds twenty new monsters, including a rancor. Some non-hostile NPCs may help the player by attacking enemies.|$|E

5|$|Star Wars Jedi Knight: <b>Mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sith was {{developed}} and published by LucasArts as an expansion to Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II. <b>Mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Siths development team was led by Stephen Shaw, the lead programmer for LucasArts titles Full Throttle and Outlaws. Development commenced immediately after Outlawss completion in 1997, which ensured the game's quick release following that of Dark Forces II.|$|E

5|$|The {{addition}} of a multiplayer mode to Jedi Knight was met positively, but questions arose to why {{there are so few}} multiplayer maps and why single-player maps cannot be used in the multiplayer mode. Tom Chick of IGN believes this was corrected with the release of <b>Mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sith.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} several technical improvements over Dark Forces II, including colored lighting, new {{textures and}} models, and improved artificial intelligence. <b>Mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sith received mostly positive reviews from critics, with praise {{given to the}} game's story and to the AI improvements.|$|E

5|$|Being an {{expansion}} to Dark Forces II, <b>Mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sith requires the Dark Forces II CD-ROM {{the first time}} the player starts the game. LucasArts has made improvements to the 3D engine used in Dark Forces II by including colored lighting. The full motion video cut scenes that were used between levels in Dark Forces II have been replaced with cinematics rendered by the 3D engine.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiplayer}} side of <b>Mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sith {{was received}} positively, {{but did not}} completely escape criticism. Emil Pagliarulo of The Adrenaline Vault questioned why certain features seemed to be missing from the multiplayer mode that {{were present in the}} single-player mode. One such feature is the rancor which appears prominently in a single-player level but is not in any multiplayer maps.|$|E

Preparations for development <b>of</b> New <b>Mystery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emblem began while development was still ongoing for , the 2008 DS remake of Shadow Dragon and <b>the</b> Blade <b>of</b> Light. <b>The</b> original plan was to release New <b>Mystery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emblem close to Shadow Dragon, but the staff decided {{that they could not}} make New <b>Mystery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emblem using <b>the</b> systems <b>of</b> Shadow Dragon, instead using <b>the</b> original <b>Mystery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emblem as a starting point. The staff included producer Tohru Narihiro, co-director Masayuki Horikawa, co-director and scenario writer Kouhei Maeda, and composers Hiroshi Morishita, Takeshi Kanezaki, Sei Murakami. Character artwork was done by Daisuke Izuka, who had worked on revamped character art for Shadow Dragon. The team added to the original narrative with new elements such as support conversations that expanded <b>the</b> personalities <b>of</b> some characters. <b>The</b> game's subtitle, [...] "Heroes of Light and Shadow" [...] made reference to the player being a [...] "shadow hero", hidden behind <b>the</b> exploits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main characters.|$|R

5|$|At the 2004 Square Enix E3 Press conference, {{producer}} Shinji Hashimoto {{said that}} many <b>mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first game would be answered. Square Enix launched the official Japanese website in May 2005, followed by the English website in December 2005. The websites featured videos and information regarding characters and worlds. Commercials were aired in Japan which highlighted the numerous Disney characters in the game. Although the game was announced in September 2003, a release date for the game was not set until two years later. Nomura admitted that the game was announced too early and information regarding the game was not released until a debut period was in sight.|$|E
5|$|Meditation is an {{integral}} part of the rosary. This mode of meditation is the process of reflecting on the <b>mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rosary. With practice, this may in time turn into contemplation on the mysteries. The practice of meditation during the praying of repeated Hail Marys dates back to 15th century Carthusian monks, and was soon adopted by the Dominicans at large. By the 16th century the practice of meditation during the rosary had spread across Europe, and the book Meditationi del Rosario della Gloriosa Maria Virgine (i.e. Meditations on the Rosary of the Glorious Virgin Mary) printed in 1569 for the rosary confraternity of Milan provided an individual meditation to accompany each bead or prayer.|$|E
5|$|The team {{considered}} several ideas, {{including a}} return to a post-apocalyptic earth and the conquest of another planet in the Alpha Centauri system, before deciding to keep the new title on Planet. The premise allowed them to mix and match old and new characters and delve into the <b>mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monoliths and alien artifacts. The backstory evolved quickly, and the main conflict centered on the return of the original alien inhabitants. The idea of humans inadvertently caught up in an off-world civil war focused the story.|$|E

5|$|Negative {{pressure}} {{is believed to}} be a property of vacuum energy, but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great <b>mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos. According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the far future as dark energy becomes even more dominant.|$|E
5|$|What {{is today}} {{considered}} {{the front of}} the vessel depicts six masks surrounding an anclabris. The anclabris is depicted as if it were made out of marble, and two sphinxes—beings that serve as allegories for the secrets and <b>mysteries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dionysian cult—are supporting the table. On the anclabris stands a small statue of Hermes, next to which hangs a mask with pipes. Above this mask may very well be the raven of Apollo. On {{the left side of the}} table, a goat is seen resting on the ground, surrounded by the symbols of the cult. Finally, a wicker basket can be found to the right of the table, out of which a snake emerges; this basket motif is often found in Dionysian artwork, and seemingly was an object of great importance to the religion.|$|E
