2500|$|The {{solution}} was to add another grid between the screen grid and the <b>main</b> <b>anode,</b> called the suppressor grid (since it suppressed secondary emission current toward the screen grid). This grid {{was held at the}} cathode (or [...] "ground") voltage and its negative voltage (relative to the anode) electrostatically repelled secondary electrons so that they would be collected by the anode after all. This three-grid tube is called a pentode, meaning five electrodes. The pentode was invented in 1926 by Bernard D. H. Tellegen and became generally favored over the simple tetrode. Pentodes are made in two classes: those with the suppressor grid wired internally to the cathode (e.g. EL84/6BQ5) and those with the suppressor grid wired to a separate pin for user access (e.g. 803, 837). An alternative solution for power applications is the beam tetrode or [...] "beam power tube", discussed below.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} what {{are believed to}} be the first demonstrations of Hall-effect thrusters operating on magnesium and zinc propellant. Pathfinding experiments were performed using consumable anodes that were machined from solid magnesium and zinc, which sublimated under the heat load from the discharge plasma and delivered propellant gas to the thruster. Therefore the magnesium and zinc anodes served as the acceleration electrode and also served as the propellant supply. A retarding potential analyzer was used to obtain plume diagnostics during early operation of the experiments, showing reasonable acceleration of the propellant ions. Two main issues were expected and encountered with the solid magnesium and zinc anodes – 1) the zinc anode displayed localized melting causing liquid zinc to accumulate in the discharge channel and 2) the crude scheme did not feature any means to actively control the sublimation rate of the metal propellant. A new porous anode with internal propellant reservoir was designed and built that could be refilled with either propellant, eliminating liquid intrusion into the discharge channel. A scheme developed earlier for bismuth thrusters was employed wherein shim anodes were implemented to shift discharge current to and from the <b>main</b> <b>anode</b> to control the <b>main</b> <b>anode</b> temperature and hence the metal propellant sublimation rate. Results are reported showing stable operation of a thruster using a porous anode with magnesium propellant for more than 100 minutes. Also demonstrated was the ability of the shim anode scheme to actively control the propellant mass flow rate...|$|E
40|$|WO 2003105543 A UPAB: 20040123 NOVELTY - To {{reduce the}} {{ignition}} voltage of plasmas, in a vacuum, a different anode configuration {{is used for}} ignition which requires a lower voltage than the anode to maintain the plasma discharge. An auxiliary anode is used for ignition at a small gap from the cathode with its zinc target (3) and magnetron (4), which can be {{the wall of the}} vacuum chamber (1), where the power supply (8) is switched (9) from the <b>main</b> <b>anode</b> (5) during the ignition phase. USE - The system is for use in a vacuum coating assembly e. g. for the deposition of a zinc oxide layer in a thickness of 10 - 100 nm on a glass substrate. ADVANTAGE - The system increases the anode life, by reducing the voltage required for plasma ignition using a different anode structure...|$|E
50|$|In {{other types}} of mercury-arc valve, the arc is ignited just once when the valve is first energised, and {{thereafter}} remains permanently established, alternating between the <b>main</b> <b>anode(s)</b> and a low-power auxiliary anode or keep-alive circuit.

50|$|Quadracs {{are used}} in {{lighting}} control, speed control, and temperature modulation control applications. They carry performance specifications such as peak repetitive off voltage, peak repetitive reverse voltage, root mean square (RMS) on-state current, and temperature junction. Peak repetitive off voltage is the maximum, instantaneous value of the off-state voltage that occurs across a thyristor, including all repetitive transient voltages and excluding all non-transient voltages. Peak repetitive reverse voltage is the maximum peak reverse voltage that may be applied continuously to the <b>main</b> terminals (<b>anode</b> and cathode) of quadracs. RMS on-state current is the maximum RMS current allowed for the specified use-case temperature. Temperature junction for quadracs is expressed as a full-required range.|$|R
50|$|The <b>main</b> {{challenge}} in <b>anode</b> development is preventing the anode from reacting with the electrolyte. Alternatives include new electrolyte materials or redesigning {{the interface between}} electrolyte and anode. Other challenges pertain to the particular choice of anode material, such as silicon or lithium. A great concern for silicon anodes is the large volume expansion (320%) it experiences as it alloys with lithium. For lithium anodes, dendritic lithium deposits can form, decreasing energy capacity or triggering a short circuit.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{operation}} of plasma potential con-trolled hollow anode electron gun is described. The basic {{idea of this}} new modulator is to use an auxil-iary anode, {{in addition to the}} main hollow anode. The auxiliary anode could be immersed into the plasma or placed outside the hollow anode. In the latter case the auxiliary anode it is separated by a fine mesh grid and a control gap. As the electron current is extracted from the plasma by the auxil-iary anode, the plasma potential with respect to the <b>main</b> <b>anode</b> is increased. As a result, a potential barrier preventing the electrons from reaching the acceleration gap occurs near the emissive grid as well as near the walls of the hollow anode. A deep (up to 100 %) electron beam current modulation with current pulse time parameters can be accom-plished by the proper choice of the grid mesh size, control gap length, and voltage applied to it. 1...|$|E

The gas sensor device consists of 3 <b>main</b> parts: the <b>anode</b> electrode, the cathode and the distributed polarization structure array which lie between the former two parts. All parts were coated with ZnO nanorods by a two-step hydrothermal method. Different concentration acetone gas was tested using the device.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report ammonia {{oxidation}} to nitrogen gas using microbes as biocatalyst on the anode, with polarized electrode (+ 600 mV vs. Ag/AgCl) as electron acceptor. In batch experiments, the maximal rate of ammonia-N oxidation by the mixed culture {{was similar to}} 60 mg L- 1 d(- 1), and nitrogen gas was the <b>main</b> products in <b>anode</b> compartment. Cyclic voltammetry for testing the electroactivity of the anodic biofilms revealed that an oxidation peak appeared at + 600 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl), whereas the electrode without biofilms didn't appear oxidation peak, indicating that the bioanode had good electroactivities for ammonia oxidation. Microbial community analysis of 16 S rRNA genes based on high throughput sequencing indicated {{that the combination of}} the dominant genera of Nitrosomonas, Comamonas and Paracocus could be important for the electron transfer from ammonia oxidation to anode.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} the {{technological}} experiments of static bonding {{has been carried}} out in the bonding of multi-layer Pyrex 7740 Glass and Al. The joining mechanism is analyzed with SEM and EDX. It’s observed that bonding region across the interface consists of the metal layer, oxide transitional layer and the glass layer. The bonding process can mainly be categorized into anodic process and solid state diffusing process. The pile-up of the ions and its drift in the interface area are the <b>main</b> reasons for <b>anode</b> oxidation and joining successfully. The analysis of the shear stress and deformation in the static bonded samples was made by MARC. Modeling studies showed the maximum shear stress of bonded samples all occur in the transition layer. It also shows the shear stress and deformation in the three-layer samples is significantly smaller than that in the two-layer samples. This has an important advantage in MEMS fabrication...|$|R
40|$|Millisecond dips in the RXTE/PCA archival data of Sco X- 1 {{taken from}} 1996 to 2002 were {{reported}} recently. Those dips {{were found to}} be most likely caused by instrumental dead time but may also contain some true astronomical events, which were interpreted as the occultation of X-rays from Sco X- 1 by Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNO) of 100 -m size. Here we report the results of search for millisecond dip events with the new RXTE/PCA data of Sco X- 1 taken in year 2007. Adopting the same selection criteria as that in the previous study, we found only 3 dip events in 72 -ks data, much fewer than the 107 events found in the 560 -ks data taken from 1996 to 2002 reported earlier. The new data provides more detailed information of individual `very large events' (VLEs), which is not available in the old archival data. Although the number of VLEs does not obviously increase during the occurrence of dip events, all the 3 dip events are coincident in time with VLEs that have no flags set for any of the propane or the 6 <b>main</b> xenon <b>anodes.</b> It is a strong indication of instrumental effects. No significant dips which might be real occultation by 60 [...] 100 m TNOs were observed. With only 72 -ks data, however, the previously proposed possibility that about 10 percent of the dip events might not be instrumental still cannot be strictly excluded. Using the absence of those anomalous VLEs as the criterion for identifying non-instrumental dip events, we found, at a lower confidence level, 4 dip events of duration 8 - 10 ms in the 72 -ks data. Upper limits to the size distribution of TNOs at the small size end are suggested. Comment: 5 pages, 6 figures, accepted by MNRAS on May 8, 200...|$|R
40|$|Secondary {{battery is}} {{composed}} of four <b>main</b> elements: cathodes, <b>anodes,</b> membranes and electrolyte. The cathodes and the anodes {{are connected to the}} poles that allow input and output of the current generated while the battery is being charged or discharged. In this study laser welding is conducted for 40 sheets of pure copper material with thickness of 38 μm, which are used in currently manufactured lithium-ion batteries, using pulse-wave fiber laser to compare welded joint to standard bolt joint and to determine optimum process parameters. The parameters, which has significant impact on penetration of the pulse waveform laser to the overlapped thin sheets, is the peak power while the size of the weld zone is mainly affected by the pulse irradiation time and the focal position. It is confirmed that overlapping rate is affected by the pulse repetition rate rather than by the pulse irradiation time. At the cross-section of the weld zone, even with the increased peak power, the width of the front bead weld size does not change significantly, but the cross-sectional area becomes larger. This is because the energy density per pulse increases as the peak power increases. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R
30|$|Membrane {{electrode}} assembly (MEA) {{consists of three}} <b>main</b> parts: membrane, <b>anode,</b> and cathode. Nafion 117 is selected as a membrane, and the membrane is treated to remove the impurities using hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and DI water as applied in Hasran et al.’s [17] study. The treated membrane is stored in the beaker filled with DI water until it {{is ready to be}} used. Carbon cloth is used as the anode and cathode backing layer. This carbon cloth is treated with 5  wt% of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) to make it waterproof. The carbon cloth is immersed into the PTFE solution and dried in the furnace for 30  min at 380  °C. The backing layer is coated with a gas diffusion layer of carbon, where the loading is 2  mg cm− 2. The carbon is mixed with the IPA and Nafion dispersion D 520 (Dupont). The carbon slurry is casted onto the carbon cloth and dried in the oven at 100  °C for 1  h. Then, the electrocatalyst layer is ready to be coated and synthesized by PtRu/TiO 2 -CNF and commercial electrocatalyst PtRu/C, used for the anode part, and Pt/C for cathode part. 2  mg cm− 2 loading of electrocatalyst is added with IPA (1100  μL), DI water (300  μL), and Nafion dispersion (24  mg). The solution is dispersed in the homogenizer for 1  min and casted onto the carbon cloth. The anode and cathode are dried in the oven for 1  h at 100  °C. The anode and cathode are clamped together with membrane in the middle using hot press at the condition of 135  °C and 50  kPa for 3  min. The MEA is ready to be used in single-cell performance testing.|$|R
40|$|I {{subscribe}} to an excellent maga-zine called Underground Construc-tion. Its theme {{is all about}} safety in construction work. The recent issue had articles on proper trench preparation, sheeting and shoring, and confined space entry. These are all items of importance to those working with underground struc-tures. There was a supplement to the re-cent issue of the NACE International magazine Coatings Pro with the word “SAFETY ” in bold letters on the cover. In the publication were several articles on safety with abrasive blast-ing, coating procedures, and work on large structures. This primer on safety got me think-ing about {{an important aspect of}} our work that I have always stressed— {{that we are in the}} safety business. Our work involves preventing leaks in pipelines and tanks containing hazardous materials; ensuring the safety of buildings, towers, and other structures; preventing corrosion on ship hulls and ballast tanks; advising on proper water treatment for boilers and hot water heating systems; and many other aspects of daily industri-al, commercial, and private life. We are all familiar with the terrible tragedies and destruction that can oc-cur from corrosion leaks in pipelines and underground tanks. Gasoline leaking from an underground tank can infiltrate into a sewer system and work its way back into homes through sewer lines. That can not only make a home unfit for living, but also cause a fire or explosion. I remember one case where a leak from a bare 20 -in (508 -mm) high-pressure gas <b>main</b> having galvanic <b>anode</b> cathodic pro-tection (CP) worked its way into a re-mote teller enclosure at a bank, caught fire, and burned two young workers very badly.
