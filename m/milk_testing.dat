These data were used to evaluate three brucellosis screening programs, the area recertification program, the market cow program and the <b>milk</b> <b>test</b> program. The <b>milk</b> <b>test</b> program was the most efficient program at detecting brucellosis, 29. 5 % of the herds tested were classified as infected, but lacked the ability to detect {{a large proportion of}} "infected" herds (relative sensitivity = 24 %). The market cow program was more efficient than the area recertification program at finding infected herds, 3. 9 % of the herds tested under the market cow program were infected, but had a low relative sensitivity of 12 %. The area recertification program was least efficient, 2. 3 % of herds tested under the area recertification program were infected, but had the highest relative sensitivity (53 %). The relative efficiency (predictive value) of the programs was not affected significantly by location of the herds, season of the initial test or herd size.

Methods: Sixteen Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. The rats were classified randomly into two equally numbered groups (eight rats each) : the control (Group 1) and the experiment group (Group 2). The femoral artery was dissected completely in all rats. Following division of the artery, anastomoses were conducted with microvascular techniques.

They were evaluated for edema, inflammation, vascular wall injury, intimal hyperplasia, medial atrophy, thrombus, calcification, foreign body reactions, and the endothelial proliferation. Results: The Acland <b>milking</b> <b>test</b> showed a 100 % vascular patency in both groups.

40|$|International audienceVector-borne {{diseases}} pose {{a special}} challenge to veterinary authorities due to complex and time-consuming surveillance programs {{taking into account}} vector habitat. Using stochastic scenario tree modelling, each possible surveillance activity of a future surveillance system can be evaluated with regard to its sensitivity and the expected cost. The overall sensitivity of various potential surveillance systems, composed of different combinations of surveillance activities, is calculated and the proposed surveillance system is optimized {{with respect to the}} considered surveillance activities, the sensitivity and the cost. The objective of this project was to use stochastic scenario tree modelling in combination with a simple cost analysis in order to develop the national surveillance system for Bluetongue in Switzerland. This surveillance system was established due to the emerging outbreak of Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV- 8) in Northern Europe in 2006.
