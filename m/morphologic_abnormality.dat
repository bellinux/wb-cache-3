40|$|The {{complete}} {{blood count}} (CBC) is a commonly performed diagnostic tool {{that is used to}} investigate haematology abnormalities most often anaemia, inflammatory disease, leukaemias, and bleeding disorders. CBCs provide numeric and morphologic information regarding the red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs). Haematology analysers provide numerical information while concurrent blood smear evaluation allows for confirmation of the analyser data and assessment for <b>morphologic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> that often cannot be detected via analyser alone.

40|$|Intra-articular {{abnormalities}} of the hip, such as labral tears, loose bodies, chondral lesions, ligamentum teres tears and femoral acetabular impingement {{are increasingly being}} recognized in the pediatric age group. Evaluation for these abnormalities starts with a good history and physical exam. Radiographic imaging with plain films and magnetic resonance imaging help confirm the clinical impression. Arthroscopy of the hip can be utilized to diagnose and treat these abnormalities. Arthroscopy of the hip is a challenging procedure with a learning curve that requires a thorough knowledge of the anatomy of the hip. The hip is a deeply recessed joint that has a large muscular envelope, thick joint capsule and convex and concave surfaces of the femoral head and acetabulum, respectively. The normal anatomy may be distorted due to childhood developmental disorders such as hip dysplasia, Legg–Calve–Perthes Disease and Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis that adds additional challenges to the arthroscopist.

This issue of Endocrinology Rounds presents {{an overview of the}} causes and pathology of ACTH hypersecretion, which is generally associ-ated with Cushing’s disease. The most common <b>morphologic</b> <b>abnormality</b> associated with this disorder is a basophilic microadenoma of the pituitary gland, accompanied by Crooke’s hyaline change in the cytoplasm of nontumourous corticotrophs. Tumour cells exhibit cytoplasmic PAS positivity and are immunoreactive for ACTH and related proopio-melanocortin (POMC) -derived peptides. Other tumour variants include chromophobic macroadenomas and Crooke’s cell adenomas. Corticotroph carcinomas are rare and gen-erally diagnosed only when cerebrospinal and/or systemic metastases are documented. Patients with Nelson’s syndrome usually have rapidly growing, invasive, aggressive corti-cotroph adenomas. Cushing’s disease may rarely be the result of a nodular or diffuse corti-cotroph hyperplasia.

40|$|Patellofemoral instability, also {{referred}} to as episodic patella dislocation (EPD), occurs at an incidence of 7 per 100, 000 people across all age groups. Many anatomical factors are known to contribute to EPD. The most common of these are trochlea dysplasia and patella alta. Patella alta is increasingly being recognized as a main contributing factor in EPD. This <b>morphologic</b> <b>abnormality</b> exists when the patella is located in an exaggerated proximal position such that it does not engage in the trochlea appropriately. The exact biomechanical mechanism that links patella alta to EPD is unclear, but {{it is likely to be}} multifactorial. A delay in patellofemoral contact and engagement predisposes to patella dislocation and potentially increased rates of patellofemoral osteoarthritis. Surgical management of patella alta in the setting of EPD aims to restore patella height and patella tendon length back to normal indices. The goal is to improve patellofemoral engagement and prevent further patella dislocations. The recommended procedures include a distalizing tibial tubercle osteotomy and patella tendon tenodesis, which are frequently combined with other procedures to stabilize the patella. Overall, excellent surgical results have been recorded for these procedures in the short term to medium term...|$|E

The aims {{of this study were}} to evaluate a previously developed classification system and to test the hypothesis that the pancreatic duct can be involved in PSC. METHODS: Two observers scored 132 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCPs) from established PSC patients. From 30 patients, subsequent ERCPs were scored and compared with the initial ERCPs. The pancreatic duct was judged with regard to <b>morphologic</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> RESULTS: The classification system was applicable in 107 patients. In 10 ERCPs (7. 6 %), no clear intrahepatic abnormalities were found; 15 other ERCPs (11. 4 %) did not show extrahepatic abnormalities. In 30 cases, a subsequent ERCP was judged. The difference in scoring between the initial and the subsequent ERCPs was statistically significant, with the subsequent ERCP having higher intrahepatic and extrahepatic scores. Sixty-four adequately filled pancreatic ducts were analyzed. In two cases (3. 1 %), <b>morphologic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were found. CONCLUSIONS: The previously developed scoring system is very applicable for almost all PSC patients when supplemented with a type 0 category.

40|$|A mutant of Escherichia coli is {{described}} whose cells show a spherical or irregular morphology, associated with leakage of beta-galactosidase and other intracellular proteins. The {{expression of the}} <b>morphologic</b> <b>abnormality</b> is most marked when the mutant is grown in rich media and is suppressed by D-alamine, D-serine, D-glutamate, or glycine supplementation. D-Alanine {{is the most effective}} amino acid supplement, half maximally supressing this anomalous property at a concentration of 75 mug/ml, as measured by the reduction in beta-galactosidase released from the cells. The mutant is more sensitive to penicillin G, D-methionine, and D-valine and it is relatively resistant to lysozyme. These phenotypic abnormalities are likewise corrected by the above supplementations. The relative rates of peptidoglycan synthesis in mutant and parent, grown under restrictive conditions, were measured both in vivo and in vitro by rates of incorporation of L-[14 -D]alanine and uridine- 5 '-diphosphate-N-acetyl-D-[1 - 15 C-A 1 -glucosamine, respectively. There is not metabolic block in the biosynthesis of uridine- 5 '-diphosphate-N-acetyl-muramyl-pentapeptide as shown by enzymic analysis and the lack of accumulation of uridine- 5 '-diphosphate-N-acetylmuramyl-peptide precursors.

All were men (aged 34 - 55 years), each had peripheral arthritis in addition to spondylitis, all had severe congestive failure, and six had con-duction disturbances. In three patients aortic regurgitation was present before distinctive radio-logic changes of ankylosing spondylitis were apparent and only two patients had advanced arthritic changes of ankylosing spondylitis. Thus, cardiac dysfunction may be present before signs of spondylitis are apparent, and aortic regurgitation may be severe when signs of spondy-litis are minimal. A characteristic cardiovascular <b>morphologic</b> <b>abnormality</b> was present in each patient. The aortic valve cusps and the aorta behind and immediately above the sinuses of Val-salva were thickened, the latter by dense adventitial scar tissue and by intimal fibrous prolifera-tion. In each patient the scar tissue in the root of aorta extended below the base of aortic valve to produce a subaortic fibrous ridge.

Nerve fiber tortuosity may indicate a degenerative and attempted regenerative response of nerve fibers to diabetes. The {{purpose of this}} study was to define alterations in the tortuosity of corneal nerve fibers in relation to age, duration of diabetes, glycemic control, and neuropathic severity. METHODS: The cornea and collected images of the subbasal nerve plexus of 18 diabetic patients (stratified into mild, moderate, and severe neuropathic groups using conventional clinical measures of neuropathy) and 18 age-matched nondiabetic control subjects were scanned, and a novel mathematical paradigm was applied to quantify the extent of nerve tortuosity, which was termed the tortuosity coefficient (TC).

40|$|ABSTRACT We have {{previously}} reported a decreased {{activity of the}} lysosomal enzyme dipeptidyl aminopeptidase-I (DAP- 1) in cultured fibroblasts from patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD). Here we report that electron microscope examination of these cells reveals the presence of abundant lamellar bodies, a <b>morphologic</b> <b>abnormality</b> commonly associated with impaired lysosomal function. Morphometric analysis of these cytoplasmic figures in dystrophic cells shows a sevenfold increase relative to normal controls (P < 0. 01). Analysis of lysosomal density profiles by density gradient centrifugation reveals similar patterns in normal and DMD cells. Treatment of lysosomes with the nonionic detergent Triton X- 100 causes an activation of DAP-I This activation, attributable to structure-linked latency, is markedly diminished in DMD cells which show an optimal activation of only 180 % compared to 255 % for control fibroblasts (P < 0. 01). These data suggest an alteration in {{the properties of the}} lysosomal membrane in DMD fibroblasts. This suggestion is also supported by studies on the release of DAP- 1 from lysosomes by osmotic shock which show it to be a membrane-associated enzyme with membrane-binding characteristics intermediate between those of tightly bound,ß-glucosidase and those of unbound N-acetylgalactosaminidase. The latency characteristics of these other lysosomal enzymes are not altered in the DMD cells, indicating that the effect i...|$|E
40|$|Extract] Disease is {{the absence}} of health and is usually {{manifested}} by the presence of a lesion (a <b>morphologic</b> <b>abnormality).</b> Three important points should be kept in mind when reading this chapter: 1. Diseases can have many causes; some of these are infectious (such as bacteria, parasites, or viruses) and others are not (such as genetically-based or toxicant-induced disorders). 2. The typical sign of a diseased coral is a lesion; a manifestation of disease that may not provide any clue regarding causation. 3. Some lesions in corals may have known causes that are not attributable to disease, though they result in the coral's health being compromised. For example, fish bites and crown-of-thorns starfish feeding scars should be characterized as predation; lesions associated with breakages may be caused by storms or anchor damage and should be characterized as disturbance; and lesions caused by aggressive interactions between corals or between corals and other sessile organisms should be characterized as competition. All can lead to tears and breaks in the tissue and partial mortality, and can stress the host coral. In suspected disease cases, it is often impossible to determine the cause of the lesion (and, therefore, the cause of the disease) without additional laboratory or experimental efforts (as discussed in Chapter 3) ...|$|E
40|$|PurposeThis report {{presents}} {{our experience}} with open repair of post-traumatic aneurysms of the aortic isthmus using recent surgical techniques, including distal aortic perfusion and the preferential use of direct aortoaortic anastomosis without interposition of prosthetic material. MethodsFrom 1990 to 2004, the senior author (EK) patients (21 men; mean age, 40. 3 years) who presented with post-traumatic aneurysms of the aortic isthmus were treated operatively, either with (20 patients) or without (3 patients) distal aortic perfusion, or endovascularly with a stent graft (3 patients). In 15 (75 %) of the 20 patients treated with distal aortic perfusion, the technique consisted of resection followed by direct aortoaortic anastomosis. Eight patients, including the three patients treated with simple clamping, had prosthetic replacement. ResultsNo postoperative deaths or permanent spinal cord complications occurred. One patient required reoperation to control hemorrhage. Aortography or computed tomography angiography {{was performed on}} 12 of the 15 patients treated by direct aortoaortic anastomosis, with a mean follow-up of 58. 7 ± 8. 9 months. No <b>morphologic</b> <b>abnormality</b> was found. ConclusionThis study shows that low-risk patients with a chronic post-traumatic aneurysm of the aortic isthmus can be successfully treated with excellent long-term results by resection and direct aortoaortic anastomosis without prosthetic interposition.

40|$|Background: Choroidal {{circulation}} hemodynamics in {{eyes with}} ocular blunt trauma {{has not been}} quantitatively examined yet. We quantitatively examined changes in choroidal blood flow velocity and thickness at the lesion site using laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG) and enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) in a patient with chorioretinopathy associated with ocular blunt trauma. Case presentation: A 13 -year-old boy developed a chorioretinal lesion with pigmentation extending from the optic disc to the superotemporal side in the right eye after ocular blunt trauma. The patient’s best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0. 2 in the right eye. Indocyanine green angiography showed hypofluorescence from the initial phase, with a decrease of mean blur rate (MBR) on LSFG color map, which corresponded to the chorioretinal lesion. The BCVA and foveal outer retinal <b>morphologic</b> <b>abnormality</b> spontaneously improved during follow-up. MBR and choroidal thickness increased by 23 - 31 % and 13 - 17 μm at the lesion site and by 11 - 22 % and 33 - 42 μm at the fovea, respectively, during the 6 -month follow-up period after baseline measurements in the affected eye. In contrast, these parameters showed little or no changes at the normal retinal site in the affected eye and the fovea in the fellow eye. Conclusions: Current data revealed that both blood flow velocity and thickness in the choroid at the lesion site decreased in the acute stage and subsequently increased together with improvements in visual function and outer retinal morphology. These results suggest that LSFG and EDI-OCT may be useful indices that can noninvasively evaluate activity of choroidal involvement in ocular blunt trauma-associated chorioretinopathy...|$|E

In {{nearly half of all}} cases end-stage renal failure follows hypertension or diabetes, principally type 2 noninsulin-dependent diabetes. About 30 % of patients begin dialysis on an emergency basis; this demonstrates the elevated frequency of inadequate predialysis management of chronic kidney disease, from any cause. Since 2002, "chronic kidney disease" has been defined as the persistence for more than 3 months of kidney damage, which is either a laboratory or histologic or <b>morphologic</b> <b>abnormality</b> or a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min for 1. 73 m(2) of body surface, independently of the initial cause.

Some pathologic features are shared, including the <b>morphologic</b> <b>abnormality</b> of the adrenal in both neonatal and childhood forms, but deposition of abnormally metabolized lipids is more systemic and widespread in the neonatal form. The biochemistry of the disease is presented in both children and parents. Plasma values of long-chain fatty acid C 26 : 0 are 0. 328 +/- 0. 18 micrograms/ml in a control population and 0. 381 +/- 0. 312 micrograms/ml in the father and mother. Values for C 26 : 0 in the plasma of childhood adrenoleukodystrophy are 1. 62 +/- 0. 87 micrograms/ml and in our two cases, 2. 79 micrograms/ml in the male, 1. 83 micrograms/ml in the female. The basic biochemical defect appears to be a diminished capacity to oxidize these fatty acids leading to accumulation in cholesterol esters. Fatty acid oxidation to CO 2 by cultured skin fibroblasts was 51 % of control value for stearic acid, 5 % for lignoceric acid in the male, and 39 % of control value for stearic acid, 5 % for lignoceric acid in the female.

40|$|The {{candidate}} gene approach in tracking {{the underlying cause}} {{of a number of}} genetic skin disorders has proved remarkably effective over the past few years. Electron microscopy has had a unique role in identifying <b>morphologic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> of various fibers, fibrils, and filaments, and helping to localize biochemical constituents to these structures. Nowhere is this approach more strongly demonstrated than in its application to different forms of epidermolysis bullosa, of which two major forms, junctional and dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, are caused by mutations of genes encoding structural proteins in the dermal-epidermal junction.

40|$|Background: Red {{blood cell}} (RBC) {{analysis}} {{is a key}} feature {{in the evaluation of}} hematological disorders. The gold standard light microscopy technique has high sensitivity, but is a relativity time-consuming and labor intensive procedure. This study tested the sensitivity and specificity of gold standard light microscopy manual differential to the CellaVision ® DM 96 (CCS; CellaVision, Lund, Sweden) automated image analysis system, which takes digital images of samples at high magnification and compares these images with an artificial neural network based on a database of cells and preclassified according to RBC morphology. Methods: In this study, 212 abnormal peripheral blood smears within the Calgary Laboratory Services network of hospital laboratories were selected and assessed for 15 different RBC <b>morphologic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> by manual microscopy. The same samples were reassessed as a manual addition from the instrument screen using the CellaVision ® DM 96 system with 8 microscope high power fields (× 100 objective and a 22 mm ocular). The results of the investigation were then used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the CellaVision ® DM 96 system in reference to light microscopy. Results: The sensitivity ranged from a low of 33 % (RBC agglutination) to a high of 100 % (sickle cells, stomatocytes). The remainder of the RBC abnormalities tested somewhere between these two extremes. The specificity ranged from 84 % (schistocytes) to 99. 5 % (sickle cells, stomatocytes). Conclusions: Our results showed generally high specificities but variable sensitivities for RBC <b>morphologic</b> <b>abnormalities...</b>|$|R
40|$|Multidetector row {{computed}} tomography (MDCT) is the imaging modality {{of reference for}} the diagnosis of bronchiectasis. MDCT may also detect a focal stenosis, a tumor or multiple <b>morphologic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> of the bronchial tree. It may orient the endoscopist towards the abnormal bronchi, and in all cases assess {{the extent of the}} bronchial lesions. The CT findings of bronchial abnormalities include anomalies of bronchial division and origin, bronchial stenosis, bronchial wall thickening, lumen dilatation, and mucoid impaction. The main CT features of bronchiectasis are increased bronchoarterial ratio, lack of bronchial tapering, and visibility of peripheral airways. Other bronchial abnormalities include excessive bronchial collapse at expiration, outpouchings and diverticula, dehiscence, fistulas, and calcifications...|$|R
