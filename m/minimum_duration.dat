30|$|Referring to Question 3 of {{the study}} (i.e., After {{the end of the}} class, can the {{lecturer}} discover and compare statistically relevant relationships on the interaction data between high performance groups and low performance groups based?); the average time spent to finish the concept mapping activity were 12 and 18.6  min in the High Performance groups and the Low Performance groups, respectively. Therefore, none of the two groups consumed whole the legitimate time (30  min) to accomplish the distance concept mapping activity. The maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>durations</b> of time spent to finish the distance concept mapping activity were 18  min and 5  s and 5  min and 55  s in the high Performance groups, respectively. The maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>durations</b> of time to finish the same activity were 19  min and 57  s and 16  min and 25  s in the Low Performance groups, respectively.

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} {{the effect of}} average luminance level on texture segregation by motion. We determined the <b>minimum</b> presentation <b>duration</b> required for subjects to detect a target defined by motion direction against a moving background. The average luminance level and retinal position of the target were systematically varied. We found that the <b>minimum</b> presentation <b>duration</b> needed for texture segregation depends significantly on the average luminance level and on retinal position. The <b>minimum</b> presentation <b>duration</b> increased as the mean luminance decreased. At a very low (presumably scotopic) luminance level, the motion-defined target was never detected rapidly. Under scotopic conditions, the <b>minimum</b> presentation <b>duration</b> was shorter in the periphery than in a near foveal region when the task was simple detection of the target. When the task included identifying {{the shape of the}} target patch, however, the target presented near the fovea was identified faster at all luminance levels. These results suggest that the performance of texture segregation is constrained by the spatiotemporal characteristics of the early visual system...|$|R

60|$|The {{progress}} of knowledge may, one day, {{enable us to}} deduce from such facts as these the maximum {{rate at which the}} chalk can have accumulated, and thus to arrive at the <b>minimum</b> <b>duration</b> of the chalk period. Suppose that the valve of the Crania upon which a coralline has fixed itself in the way just described, is so attached to the sea-urchin that no part of it is more than an inch above the face upon which the sea-urchin rests. Then, as the coralline could not have fixed itself, if the Crania had been covered up with chalk mud, and could not have lived had itself been so covered it follows, that an inch of chalk mud could not have accumulated within the time between the death and decay of the soft parts of the sea-urchin and the growth of the coralline to the full size which it has attained. If the decay of the soft parts of the sea-urchin; the attachment, growth to maturity, and decay of the Crania; and the subsequent attachment and growth of the coralline, took a year (which is a low estimate enough), the accumulation of the inch of chalk must have taken more than a year: and the deposit of a thousand feet of chalk must, consequently, have taken more than twelve thousand years.|$|E

40|$|Regional {{declines in}} insect pollinators have raised {{concerns}} about crop pollination. Many pollinator studies use visitation rate (pollinators/time) {{as a proxy for}} the quality of crop pollination. Visitation rate estimates are based on observation durations that vary significantly between studies. How observation duration relates to the accuracy of the visitation rate estimate is, however, unknown. We studied this relationship using six day-long observations (06 : 00. h- 19 : 00. h) in leek-seed production fields (totalling 78. h). We analysed beyond which point in time observing longer did not significantly improve the accuracy of the visitation rate estimate (<b>minimum</b> observation <b>duration).</b> We furthermore explored the relationship between the <b>minimum</b> observation <b>duration</b> and visitation rate, time of day and temperature. We found that the <b>minimum</b> observation <b>duration</b> (mean. ±. SD: 24. ±. 11. 9. min) was significantly related to visitation rate, where the observation time required to obtain accurate estimates decreased with increasing visitation rate. <b>Minimum</b> observation <b>duration</b> varied greatly between days and between fields but not within days. Within days, the visitation rates differed significantly only between the hour-intervals 06 : 00. h- 07 : 00. h (lowest visitation rate) and 09 : 00. h- 11 : 00. h (highest rate). <b>Minimum</b> observation <b>duration</b> decreased up to around 22. °C beyond which it remained fairly stable. Surprisingly, even after three day-long observations on the same plant we found new pollinator species visiting the flowers, suggesting that species-richness estimates based on plant observations alone probably underestimate true species richness. Because especially between-day variation in visitation rate on single plants can be large, reliable estimates of the pollinator visitation rate during the plant's flowering time require observations on multiple days. Standardising the number of pollinators rather than the time to observe (standardised pollinator timing approach: time to n-pollinator visits) may provide more consistent accurate assessments of visitation rate, especially for studies that use gradients in visitation rates to examine the contribution of pollinators to crop pollination...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a Monte-Carlo software simulation that evaluates the performance of a Fixed Channel Allocation (FCA) scheme for four different conditions namely, traffic distribution, terminal mobility, mean call <b>duration</b> and <b>minimum</b> call <b>duration.</b> The performance of the system has been assessed by evaluating the carried traffic and the call blocking percentage (including forced call termination) as a function of each of the four parameters. It is shown that knowledge of channel propagation alone is not sufficient enough for good frequency planning. Hence it is shown that the performance of a FCA scheme depends not only on channel propagation but also on traffic distribution, terminal mobility, mean call <b>duration</b> and <b>minimum</b> call <b>duration.</b> The performance of a Hybrid Dynamic Channel Allocation (HDCA) is also presented...|$|R
