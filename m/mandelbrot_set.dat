5|$|Mathematics has {{directly}} influenced {{art with}} conceptual {{tools such as}} linear perspective, the analysis of symmetry, and mathematical objects such as polyhedra and the Möbius strip. Magnus Wenninger creates colourful stellated polyhedra, originally as models for teaching. Mathematical concepts such as recursion and logical paradox {{can be seen in}} paintings by Rene Magritte and in engravings by M. C. Escher. Computer art often makes use of fractals including the <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>set,</b> and sometimes explores other mathematical objects such as cellular automata. Controversially, the artist David Hockney has argued that artists from the Renaissance onwards made use of the camera lucida to draw precise representations of scenes; the architect Philip Steadman similarly argued that Vermeer used the camera obscura in his distinctively observed paintings.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the definition of the <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>set,</b> there is a close correspondence between the geometry of the <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>set</b> at a given point and the structure of the corresponding Julia set. For instance, a point is in the <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>set</b> exactly when the corresponding Julia set is connected.|$|E
25|$|The {{dynamical}} {{formula for}} the uniformisation of the complement of the <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>set,</b> arising from Douady and Hubbard's {{proof of the}} connectedness of , gives rise to external rays of the <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>set.</b> These rays {{can be used to}} study the <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>set</b> in combinatorial terms and form the backbone of the Yoccoz parapuzzle.|$|E
30|$|Julia and <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> {{have been}} studied under the effect of noises [1 – 17] arising in the objects. In 2004, Rani and Kumar [5, 16] {{introduced}} superior iterates (a two-step feedback process) {{in the study of}} fractal theory and created superior Julia and <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets.</b> Later on, in a series of papers Rani et al. generated and analyzed superior Julia and superior <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> for quadratic [3 – 6, 13 – 17], cubic [10], and nth degree [3, 5, 8, 13 – 16] complex polynomials. After creation of superior <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets,</b> Negi and Rani [4] collected the properties of midgets of quadratic superior <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets.</b> Negi and Rani [3] simulated the behavior of Julia sets using switching processes. Superior Julia and superior <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> have also been studied under the effect of noises [2 – 6, 8, 9, 13 – 17]. Chauhan et al. [8, 9] obtained new Julia and <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> via Ishikawa iterates (an example of three-step feedback process). Kang et al. [18] introduced Julia and <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> in Jungck Mann and Jungck Ishikawa orbits.|$|R

By an {{analysis}} of symmetric features of equivalent mappings of the frieze group, a definition of their generalized <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> is given and a novel method for constructing generalized <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> of equivalent mappings of frieze group is presented via utilizing the Ljapunov exponent as the judgment standard. Based on generating parameter space of dynamical system, lots of patterns of generalized <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> are produced...|$|R
30|$|The escape {{criterion}} plays a {{vital role}} in the generation and analysis of Julia <b>sets</b> and <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets.</b> We now define escape criterions for Julia <b>sets</b> and <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> in Noor orbit with s-convexity.|$|R
25|$|The Hausdorff {{dimension}} of the boundary of the <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>set</b> equals 2 as determined by a result of Mitsuhiro Shishikura. It is not known whether the boundary of the <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>set</b> has positive planar Lebesgue measure.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} three-cornered shape {{created by}} this fractal repeats with variations at different scales, showing {{the same sort}} of self-similarity as the <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>set.</b> In addition to smaller tricorns, smaller versions of the <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>set</b> are also contained within the tricorn fractal.|$|E
25|$|The {{occurrence}} of π in the <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>set</b> {{was discovered by}} David Boll in 1991. He found that {{when looking at the}} pinch points of the <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>set,</b> the number of iterations needed for the point (−3/4, ε) before escaping, multiplied by ε, was equal to π. Based on this initial finding, Aaron Klebanoff developed a further test near another pinch point (1/4 + ε, 0) in the <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>set</b> and found that the number of iterations times the square root of ε was equal to π.|$|E
30|$|The escape {{criterion}} {{is the key}} {{to generate}} the Julia <b>sets</b> and <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets.</b> In this paper, we prove the escape criterions of Julia and <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> for quadratics, cubics and the higher degree complex polynomials in Jungck Mann orbit.|$|R
30|$|In 1994, Hudzik and Maligranda (1994) {{explained}} a few results {{connecting with}} s-convex functions in second sense. Some new results for s-convex functions about Hadamard’s inequality {{are discussed in}} Alomari and Darus (2008 a, b), Kirmaci (2007). Takahashi (1970) introduced a notion of convex metric space and in 1999, for s-convex functions in second sense, (Dragomir and Fitzpatrick 1999) proved a variant of Hermite–Hadamard’s inequality. The fractal structures of Julia and <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> for quadratic, cubic, and higher degree polynomials, by using Picard orbit have been demonstrated in Devaney (1992). In 2004, Rani and Kumar (2004 a, b) introduced superior Julia and <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> using Mann iteration scheme. Rana et al. (2010 a, b) introduced relative superior Julia and <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> using Ishikawa iteration scheme. Also, relative superior Julia <b>sets,</b> <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> and tricorn and multicorns by using S-iteration scheme are presented in Kang et al. (2015 a). Recently, (Ashish and Chugh 2014) introduced Julia and <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> using Noor iteration scheme which is a three-step iterative procedure.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Symmetric {{features}} of the frieze group equivalent mappings were analysed, and two partitioning algorithms are given for constructing generalized <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> of frieze group equivalent mappings in order to study the characteristics of generalized Msets.

25|$|The cover {{article of}} the August 1985 Scientific American {{introduced}} {{a wide audience}} to the algorithm for computing the <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>set.</b> The cover featured an image created by Peitgen, et al. The <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>set</b> became prominent in the mid-1980s as a computer graphics demo, when personal computers became powerful enough to plot and display the set in high resolution.|$|E

30|$|In {{this paper}} we {{presented}} new fixed point results for Noor iteration with s-convexity {{in the generation}} of fractals (Julia <b>sets</b> and <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets).</b> The new escape criterions have been established for complex quadratic, cubic, and (k+ 1)th degree polynomials. Very interesting changes in <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> can be seen when s varies from lowest to higher values but variation of s does not effect Julia sets. The results of escape criterions for Julia <b>sets</b> and <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> in Noor orbit presented in Ashish and Chugh (2014) are as special case of our results for s= 1.|$|R
3000|$|This {{corollary}} {{gives us}} an algorithm for the generation of Julia <b>sets</b> and <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> of T_c. Given any point [...] z≤ c, we have computed the orbit ‘JIO’ of z. If for some n, [...] z_n lies outside the circle of radius {|c|, 2 (1 +|a|)/sα, 2 (1 +|a|)/sβ}, we guarantee that the orbit escapes. Hence, z {{is not in the}} Julia sets and also it is not in the <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets.</b> On the other hand, if [...] z_n never exceeds this bound, then by definition of the Julia <b>sets</b> and the <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> we can make extensive use of this algorithm in the next section.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} self-similar sets in {{the plane}} for which a cyclic group acts transitively on the pieces. Examples like n-gon Sierpiński gaskets, Gosper snowflake and terdragon are well-known, but we study the whole family. For each n our family is parametrized by the points in the unit disk. Due to a connectedness criterion, there are corresponding <b>Mandelbrot</b> <b>sets</b> which are used to find various new examples with interesting properties.
