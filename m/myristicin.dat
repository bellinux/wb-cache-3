50|$|Nutmeg oil is a {{volatile}} essential oil from nutmeg (Myristica fragrans). The oil is colorless or light yellow and smells and tastes of nutmeg. It contains numerous components {{of interest to}} the oleochemical industry. The essential oil consists of approximately 90% terpene hydrocarbons. Prominent components are sabinene, α-pinene, β-pinene and limonene. A major oxygen-containing component is terpinen-4-ol. The oil also contain small amounts of various phenolic compounds and aromatic ethers, e.g. <b>myristicin,</b> elemicin, safrole and methyl eugenol. The phenolic fraction is considered main contributor to the characteristic nutmeg odor. <b>Myristicin</b> and elemicin are suspected to be responsible for the hallucinogenic properties of nutmeg oil.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} a {{detailed}} review of <b>myristicin</b> is reported. Numerous literatures report that <b>myristicin</b> {{is responsible for}} hallucinogenic effects, which induced by the consumption of nutmeg due to its metabolism structure of 3 -methoxy- 4, 5 -methylendioxyamphetamine (MMDA). Minimum dosage of nutmeg that can cause psychogenic effect is 5 g (ground nutmeg) with 1 to 2 mg <b>myristicin</b> content and this dosage is considered as ‘toxic dose’. At higher dosage of <b>myristicin</b> death may occur. Additionally, <b>Myristicin</b> poisoning can lead to many health problems that related to brain problem. Those symptoms usually occur 3 to 6 hours after ingestion of <b>myristicin</b> or foodstuffs containing it, and effects may persist up to 72 hours.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} physiologically based kinetic (PBK) {{models for the}} alkenylbenzene <b>myristicin</b> that were developed by extension of the PBK models for the structurally related alkenylbenzene safrole in rat and human. The newly developed <b>myristicin</b> models revealed that {{the formation of the}} proximate carcinogenic metabolite 1 ′-hydroxymyristicin in liver is at most 1. 8 fold higher in rat than in human and limited for the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite 1 ′-sulfoxymyristicin to (2. 8 – 4. 0) -fold higher in human. In addition, a comparison was made between the relative importance of bioactivation for <b>myristicin</b> and safrole. Model predictions indicate that for these related compounds, the formation of the 1 ′-sulfoxy metabolites in rat and human liver is comparable with a difference of 10 derived for safrole of 1. 9 – 5. 1 mg/kg bw per day. Using an estimated daily intake of <b>myristicin</b> of 0. 0019 mg/kg bw per day resulting from the use of herbs and spices, this results in MOE values for <b>myristicin</b> that amount to 1000 – 2700, indicating a priority for risk management. The results obtained illustrate that PBK modeling provides insight into possible species differences in the metabolic activation of <b>myristicin.</b> Moreover, they provide an example of how PBK modeling can facilitate a read-across in risk assessment from a compound for which in vivo toxicity studies are available to a related compound for which tumor data are not reported, thus contributing to alternatives in animal testing. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aiming to {{substitute}} toxic synthetic fungicides, {{the activity of}} nutmeg (Myristica fragrans) essential oil (EO, obtained by hydrodistillation) was investigated against two important storage fungi-Aspergillus flavus A. ochraceus. The activity of crude nutmeg EO was investigated using poison food assay (PFA). At a concentration of 0. 1 %, the EO inhibited A. flavus and A. ochraceus growth by 43 and 65 %, respectively. At a concentration of 0. 3 %, A. flavus and A. ochraceus inhibitions were 84 and 79 %, respectively. The crude nutmeg EO on fractionation by preparative TLC-bioautography presented one band from which two pure compounds were isolated by semi-preparative normal-phase high performance liquid chromatography. <b>Myristicin</b> and safrole were identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H and 13 C) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The relative % of <b>myristicin</b> and safrol in the crude EO was 10. 8 and 2. 9, respectively, determined by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector.

The R. segetum oil inhibited the HIV- 1 RT RDDP associated activity in a dose dependent manner showing an IC 50 value of 0. 094 mg/ml, while it was inactive on the RNase-H associated activity.

Three main fractions (RS 1, RS 2, and RS 3) were obtained from R. segetum {{essential oil}} fractionation, representing 79 %, 7 %, and 2 %, respectively, of the total oil. The most potent fraction was RS 2, containing dillapiol, <b>myristicin</b> and piperitenone oxide, followed by RS 3 and RS 1. Because these data might fit with the presence of dillapiol in the fractions, we hypothesized that this compound could exert inhibitory activity. Fraction RS 2 was refractionated to obtain a mixture of dillapiol and <b>myristicin</b> accounting of 3, 14 %of the total oil (RS-Ag). The RS‑Ag fraction was also active toward RDDP activity.
