40|$|This {{paper is}} based on {{determining}} {{the level of the}} antioxidant activity of beer, to which sensory acceptable amounts of selected extracts of medicinal plants were added, with the aim of obtaining a beer with increased functional and new sensory features. For purposes of this study a commercial lager beer type Pils and extracts of herbal drugs: <b>Melissae</b> <b>folium,</b> Thymi herba, Juniperi fructus, Urticae radix and Lupuli strobuli, were used. Total phenols were analyzed by the method of Folin-Ciocalteu, and the antioxidant activity of samples using FRAP and DPPH test. Sensory evaluation of beer was conducted on 80 subjects, using a nine levels hedonic scale. The results showed that the content of total phenols was the highest in the beer which thyme, juniper and lemon balm were added to (384. 22, 365. 38 and 363. 08 mg GAE/L, respectively), representing the increase of 37. 09, 30. 36 and 29. 55 % (respectively) compared to the commercial lager beer. Values of antioxidant activity were correlated with the content of total phenols. The extract of lemon balm blended in the best manner with the baseline, commercial lager beer in terms of sensory acceptability. New beer, enriched with lemon balm, had a pleasant, appealing and harmonious flavor and aroma...|$|E

40|$|Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) is a {{perennial}} herb in the mint family Lamiaceae, native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. Lemon Balm is used medicinally as a herbal tea, or in extract form. It is {{claimed to have}} antibacterial, antiviral properties (it is effective against herpes simplex), {{and it is also}} used as a mild sedative or calming agent. At least one study has found it to be effective at reducing stress, although the study's authors call for further research. Its antibacterial properties have also been demonstrated scientifically, although they are markedly weaker than those from a number of other plants studied. Pharmacology Activities of Melissa officinalis Antiviral actvity Aqueous extracts of <b>Folium</b> <b>Melissae</b> inhibited the replication in vitro of herpes simplex virus type 2, influenza virus A 2 (Mannheim 57) and vaccinia virus at a concentration of 10 % 1. A dried aqueous extract of the leaves inhibited the replication of herpes simplex viruses in vitro at a concentration of 200 mg/ml 2. A condensed tannin isolated from an aqueous extract of the leaves inhibited haemagglutination induced by Newcastle disease virus or mumps virus; protected eggs and chick cell cultures from infection by Newcastle disease virus; and prevented haemagglutination by Newcastl...|$|R
40|$|Background: Herbal {{preparations}} like STW 5 (Iberogast(R)) {{are widely}} used drugs {{in the treatment of}} dyspepsia and motility-related disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. STW 5 is a phytotherapeutic agent consisting of a fixed mixture of 9 individual plant extracts. The electrophysiological mechanisms of action of STW 5 remain obscure. Aim: The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether herbal extracts influence electrophysiological parameters of the small intestine. For this purpose, the resting membrane potential (RMP) and the slow wave rhythmicity of smooth muscle cells of mouse small intestine were observed. Methods: Intracellular recordings of smooth muscle cells of the circular muscle layer of mouse small intestine were performed using standard microelectrode techniques. After dissection of the mucosa, the small intestine was placed in an organ bath and a microelectrode was applied on a circular smooth muscle cell. The RMP and the amplitude of slow waves were measured in millivolts. Results: The RMP of smooth muscle cells was - 59 +/- 1. 3 mV. This RMP was significantly depolarized by STW 5 (9. 6 +/- 1. 6 mV); the depolarizing effects can be mainly attributed to the constituents of matricariae flos, angelicae radix and chelidonii herba. The basal frequency of small intestinal slow waves was 39. 5 +/- 1. 4 min(- 1) and the amplitude was 23. 1 +/- 0. 9 mV. STW 5 significantly reduced the amplitude and frequency of the slow waves (11. 7 +/- 0. 8 mV; 33. 5 +/- 3. 4 min(- 1)). This effect on slow waves represents the sum of the effects of the 9 phytoextracts. Whereas angelicae radix and matricariae flos completely blocked slow wave activity, Iberis amara increased the frequency and amplitude, chelidonii herba reduced the frequency and amplitude of the slow waves, mentae piperitae folium reduced the frequency and left amplitude unchanged and liquiritae radix, carvi fructus and <b>melissae</b> <b>folium</b> had no effects. Conclusion: Herbal extracts cause changes in smooth muscle RMP and slow wave rhythmicity, up to reversible abolition, by blockade of large conductance Ca 2 + channels and other not yet identified mechanisms. In herbal preparations like STW 5 these effects add up to a total effect and this study indicates that herbal preparations which {{are widely used}} in dyspepsia and motility-related disorders have characteristic, reproducible, reversible effects on small intestinal electrophysiology.
