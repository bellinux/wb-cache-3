5000|$|Industrial melanism is {{widespread}} in the Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), involving species such as Hamadryas feronia (variable cracker butterfly), Odontopera bidentata (scalloped hazel moth), Oligia latruncula (tawny <b>marbled</b> <b>minor</b> <b>moth),</b> Oligia strigilis (<b>marbled</b> <b>minor</b> <b>moth),</b> Lymantria monacha (dark arches), and many other species of moth; the most studied example is in the peppered moth, Biston betularia. It is also seen in a beetle, Adalia bipunctata (two-spot ladybird), where camouflage is not involved as the insect has conspicuous warning coloration. The rapid decline of melanism that has accompanied the reduction of pollution makes natural selection [...] "the only credible explanation". Camouflage against a darker background is the usual historical explanation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>marbled</b> <b>minor</b> (Oligia strigilis) is a moth of {{the family}} Noctuidae. It is {{distributed}} throughout Europe, east through the Palearctic to central Asia, and the Altai Mountains. It rises to heights of over 1500 meters in the Alps.|$|R
50|$|The tawny <b>marbled</b> <b>minor</b> (Oligia latruncula) is {{a species}} of moth {{belonging}} to the family Noctuidae. It is distributed throughout Europe from northern Scotland and middle Fennoscandia in the North and then South to central Spain, Sicily and Greece. In the East, the species ranges to Western Asia.In the Alps it rises to an altitude of 2000 meters.|$|R
5000|$|The {{wingspan}} is 24-28 mm. This {{species is}} extremely {{similar to the}} <b>marbled</b> <b>minor</b> (Oligia strigilis) and the tawny <b>marbled</b> <b>minor</b> (Oligia latruncula) and specific identification usually requires close study of the genitalia. See Townsend et al. [...] for genitalia images and an identification key.O. versicolor has a wingspan of 23-28 mm and often has more brightly coloured forewings than its congeners with rich reddish-brown tones and a grey subterminal band. There is also often one or more tufts of reddish hairs on the thorax, always lacking in its congeners. Although melanism occurs in this species it is much less frequent than {{in the other two}} species. O. versicolor flies at night in June and July [...] and is attracted to light and sugar. It prefers moist areas. These include, for example, meadows, moors, wet heath and fen, woodland areas, sometimes sandy soils, but not strongly xerothermic habitats.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{invertebrates}} feed on soft rush, including the rufous <b>minor</b> <b>moth.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This {{species is}} almost {{identical}} to its relatives the rufous minor (O. versicolor) and the tawny <b>marbled</b> <b>minor</b> (O. latruncula) and identification generally requires dissection to study the genitalia. See Townsend et al. for genitalia images and an identification key.This species averages slightly larger than its two cousins but the dimensions of all three species overlap. It flies at night from May to July [...] and is attracted to light and sugar.|$|R
50|$|The area {{supports}} a diverse invertebrate fauna, {{which includes the}} nationally rare least <b>minor</b> <b>moth,</b> Photedes captiuncula, the nationally notable Durham argus butterfly, Aricia artaxerxes salmacis, and the common glow-worm, Lampyris noctiluca.|$|R
50|$|The Durham coast also {{supports}} {{a variety of}} birds, including nationally important populations of sanderling, wintering purple sandpiper and breeding little tern. There is also a rich variety of invertebrates, including colonies of the Durham Argus butterfly, Aricia artaxerxes salmacis, and the least <b>minor</b> <b>moth,</b> Photedes captiuncula.|$|R
5000|$|This {{species is}} {{extremely}} {{similar to the}} <b>marbled</b> <b>minor</b> (Oligia strigilis) and the rufous minor (Oligia versicolor) and specific identification usually requires close study of the genitalia. See Townsend et al. [...] for genitalia images and an identification key. With a wingspan of 24-27 mm, O. latruncula is usually {{the smallest of the}} three, although they all overlap in size. Well marked specimens often have noticeably dark forewings, with blackish basal area and coppery brown, rather than whitish, subterminal band. However, melanism is very common in this species and all-dark specimens constitute 100% of the population in some areas. O. latruncula flies at night from May to August [...] and is attracted to light and sugar.|$|R
50|$|The site {{covers a}} {{spectrum}} of habitats running from an inundated pond area, through wet and dry grassland and heath, to woodland. It {{is considered to be}} of regional importance for its invertebrate population, including 33 species of water-beetle. The site also provides a habitat for nationally rare Least <b>Minor</b> <b>moth,</b> Photedes captiuncula. The wet areas of the site are relatively new, arising out of upwelling water from circa 1966 onwards, and so exhibit early stages of vegetative colonisation.|$|R
