25|$|In {{addition}} to the possible in-flight performance and <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> changes that were described above, the immediate CNS effects (i.e., within 24 hours following exposure to low-LET radiation) are anorexia and nausea. These prodromal risks are dose-dependent and, as such, can provide {{an indicator of the}} exposure dose. Estimates are ED50 = 1.08 Gy for anorexia, ED50 = 1.58 Gy for nausea, and ED50=2.40 Gy for emesis. The relative effectiveness of different radiation types in producing emesis was studied in ferrets and is illustrated in figure 6-7. High-LET radiation at doses that are below 0.5 Gy show greater relative biological effectiveness compared to low-LET radiation. The acute effects on the CNS, which are associated with increases in cytokines and chemokines, may lead to disruption in the proliferation of stem cells or memory loss that may contribute to other degenerative diseases.|$|E
25|$|MPS III, Sanfilippo syndrome, {{is marked}} by severe {{neurological}} symptoms. These include progressive dementia, aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, seizures, some deafness and loss of vision, and an inability to sleep {{for more than a}} few hours at a time. This disorder tends to have three main stages. During the first stage, early mental and <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> development may be somewhat delayed. Affected children show a marked decline in learning between ages 2 and 6, followed by eventual loss of language skills and loss of some or all hearing. Some children may never learn to speak. In the syndrome's second stage, aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, profound dementia, and irregular sleep may make children difficult to manage, particularly those who retain normal physical strength. In the syndrome's last stage, children become increasingly unsteady on their feet and most are unable to walk by age 10.|$|E

25|$|The use {{of virtual}} {{feedback}} {{has been seen}} scattered throughout history for quite some time. However, though the feedback was virtual, the performances were not widely virtual until the 1990s. With the early-stage experimentation, not many positive results were found causing some doubt of the systems. Some even found that too much virtual feedback increased poor performance outside of the controlled environment. As virtual reality systems and virtual environments became more accessible and affordable, though, so too did the implementations of and research on them. The use of these systems in positive <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> development began somewhere in the late 1990s as more researchers realized the benefit of internal, corrective feedback in such environments. Additionally, at the same time, researchers across the world began experimenting with the effect of virtual reality in therapeutic measures for anxiety disorder and phobias. With positive results, such as better motor control and lower anxiety in relation to phobias, coming from these experiments, researchers began looking into virtual reality systems {{as a form of}} rehabilitation in the early 2000s, and the research has expanded since. Now, common gaming consoles such as the Wii and Kinect allow researchers to use cheaper, more readily available systems in their labs, as well, opening up new possibilities for games and rehabilitation options. Case studies and use of systems in actual therapy offices have suggested that this field has the potential to impact therapy outside the lab setting, as well, making it a rapidly growing field of interest. Currently, several reviews of the findings have also suggested positive effects of this form of rehabilitation, garnering support for this field as well.|$|E

500|$|On the Nintendo DS, Mario & Sonic was {{regarded}} as virtually the same game in design as its Wii counterpart; however, opinions on its control scheme varied greatly. GameSpy's Gerald Villoria thought the tradeoffs between both versions made them equally enjoyable. Andrew Fitch of 1UP.com assured readers in his review that the less physically demanding gameplay of the DS version made the game accessible for extended periods of time. Fitch further stated that in nearly [...] "every case, events [...] far more enjoyable on the DS" [...] due to the requirement of the human body's finer <b>motor</b> <b>skill</b> abilities to control the characters. However, Eurogamer's Ellie Gibson noted {{that the lack of}} physical demand reduced the players' engrossment with the game.

[...] Harris felt the DS version lost some relevance to its marginally superior Wii counterpart since had a similar design and released almost three months afterwards.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Prenatal alcohol {{exposure}} (PAE) {{can cause}} fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and associated neurodevelopmental impairments. It is uncertain which types of fine <b>motor</b> <b>skills</b> {{are most likely}} to be affected after PAE or which assessment tools are most appropriate to use in FASD diagnostic assessments. This systematic review examined which types of fine <b>motor</b> <b>skills</b> are impaired in children with PAE or FASD; which fine motor assessments are appropriate for FASD diagnosis; and whether fine motor impairments are evident at both “low” and “high” PAE levels. Methods: A systematic review of relevant databases was undertaken using key terms. Relevant studies were extracted using a standardized form, and methodological quality was rated using a critical appraisal tool. Results: Twenty-four studies met inclusion criteria. Complex fine <b>motor</b> <b>skills,</b> such as visual-motor integration, were more frequently impaired than basic fine <b>motor</b> <b>skills,</b> such as grip strength. Assessment tools that specifically assessed fine <b>motor</b> <b>skills</b> more consistently identified impairments than those which assessed fine <b>motor</b> <b>skills</b> as part of a generalized neurodevelopmental assessment. Fine motor impairments were associated with “moderate” to “high” PAE levels. Few studies reported fine <b>motor</b> <b>skills</b> of children with “low” PAE levels, so the effect of lower PAE levels on fine <b>motor</b> <b>skills</b> remains uncertain. Conclusions: Comprehensive assessment of a range of fine <b>motor</b> <b>skills</b> in children with PAE is important to ensure an accurate FASD diagnosis and develop appropriate therapeutic interventions for children with PAE-related fine motor impairments. 12 page(s...|$|R
