As a result of the assessment of the appropriateness of their application in current protection, the choice was made in favor of the method based on the control of the relative current unbalance. The influence of contact resistances and load currents of various levels on the magnitude and character of the change of relative unbalance taking into account the errors of <b>measuring</b> <b>transformers</b> of current has been studied with the aid of the method of numerical experiment. It is demonstrated that in a lot of cases of arch short circuits in the loaded power line and in idle mode, the control only asymmetry is insufficient for reliable determination of the type of damage.

The paper contains a proposal of a technique that enables to detect such heat at its early study. This technique consists of a hardware and an algorithms. The hardware consists of a microprocessor-based instrument developed by the author, of <b>measuring</b> <b>transformers</b> of current and of temperature sensors. This equipment must be connected to the condenser unit with a rated voltage of 380 V. In operation, the device performs continuous measurement of the surface temperature of the casing of each condenser, the temperature of the external environment, voltage and current from the power source. The measured values are used in the mathematical model of thermal processes that enables to calculate the temperature of the hottest point of each capacitor in real-time. Then the calculation of the intrinsic difference ΔΘ 1 ° between the average temperature values of the dielectric and the base average value of this temperatures during the second day {{from the start of the}} measurements. If the Dq 1  value exceeds the value of the absolute error of simulation, diagnostic signals of abnormal levels of heating, viz. low, medium, high and very high, are generated. It is also necessary to calculate the rate of change of ΔΘ 1 ° and to consider the values obtained in the formation of hazard levels. For the low level and the average level of hazard the operation of diagnostic system with a visual signal is recommended, while for the high level of hazard it is recommended to use both visual and sound signals, and for the very high hazard level the capacitor ought to be turned off from the source. The algorithms have been developed heuristically. The final formation of the algorithms is possible only after the long-term operation of the proposed diagnosis system on real objects. The implementation of the developed system will reduce the probability of sudden failure of capacitor units and, correspondingly, will increase the reliability of power supply system of enterprise. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of the work with the master thesis written during the spring of 2016 at NTNU, where the main {{ambition}} has been to find a relay setting for earth fault protection that can work both in isolated and compensated power distribution systems. In principal, these two systems have different earth fault protection methods. Earth faults is one of the most common faults in the power distribution system and proper protection against it is therefore important. In certain situations, a different approach to the protection might be necessary than the normal relay settings. If an isolated system fails to operate, the system needs to be operated by other means. If a parallel power system exists, this can be connected to operate the system. It is not given that this parallel power system is also an isolated system. In the event that it is operated as a compensated system, there will be some detection issues for the directional earth fault relays in the normally isolated system. A description of the detection problems that might occur is therefore presented. A literature survey was then completed to try and find a solution to the described detection problems. The solutions that were found to be most relevant was: (i) non-conventional <b>measuring</b> <b>transformers,</b> (ii) extended function of coil regulator, (iii) extended operating area for the directional earth fault relay, (iv) grouping of parameter settings in the directional earth fault relay, (v) having two parameter settings active simultaneously in the directional earth fault relay and (vi) installing a high ohmic resistance in the neutral point of the transformer. The extended operating area for the directional earth fault relay was found to be the most feasible solution to be used both in isolated and compensated power distribution system. To see if this was the case, a real power system was modelled in ATPDraw, and simulations were completed with the extended operating area. The result from the simulations show that the extended operating area is able to detect earth faults according to the Norwegian regulations. The Norwegian regulation states that earth faults up to 3000 Ω needs to be detected and handled in mixed systems. Introducing asymmetry in the modelled power distribution system however, resulted in false detection of earth faults. An extended operating area for the directional earth fault relay will detect earth faults in isolated and compensated systems according to standards. The modelled power distribution system in ATPDraw is however, built on assumptions and will not be able to represent the real power distribution system to a full extent. Nevertheless, the simulations do give a good indication of what to expect from the extended operating area...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Bayesian {{approach}} to machine learning amounts to inferring posterior distributions of random variables from a probabilistic model {{of how the}} variables are related (that is, a prior distribution) {{and a set of}} observations of variables. There is a trend in machine learning towards expressing Bayesian models as probabilistic programs. As a foundation for this kind of programming, we propose a core functional calculus with primitives for sampling prior distributions and observing variables. We define combinators for <b>measure</b> <b>transformers,</b> based on theorems in measure theory, and use these to give a rigorous semantics to our core calculus. The original features of our semantics include its support for discrete, continuous, and hybrid measures, and, in particular, for observations of zero-probability events. We compile our core language to a small imperative language that has a straightforward semantics via factor graphs, data structures that enable many efficient inference algorithms. We use an existing inference engine for efficient approximate inference of posterior marginal distributions, treating thousands of observations per second for large instances of realistic models. ...|$|R

The equivalent circuit {{is based on the}} nodal conductance matrix G, nodal reciprocal inductance matrix, and nodal capacitance matrix C. So far, there were many articles published so that the transfer function of a particular transformer was extracted from the <b>measured</b> <b>transformer</b> terminal impedance. The method presented here is clear and easily applicable by making use of the powerful Matlab functions. Furthermore, one can determine the resonance frequencies of a particular transformer more accurately. To show the applicability, a lightning impulse at the transformer ter-minal is applied and a response {{at the end of the}} first pi-section (Fig. 1) is computed. These results are according to the expectations. We would appreciate an answer to the following questions: • In the particular case, it is not clearly defined whether a pi-section corresponds to a coil, a group of coils, or a turn (Fig. 2). In most cases, the transformer might suffer from steep interturn voltages. The authors claim that by using this method, there is no limit on the size of the network. To preserve reasonable calculation times and memory usage in today’s personal computers, can the authors comment on the size of the network model when all interturn volt-ages needs to be calculated? • For short-time intervals (1 s) within peak voltages, the effect of the losses is not significant [2]. However, for longer time intervals (a few hundreds of microseconds), not only might the winding losses have a significant influence but also the core losses due to the flux penetration inside the core [3].
