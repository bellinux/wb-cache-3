500|$|Crash {{appears as}} a playable {{character}} in Team Racing and Bash. The epilogue of Team Racing states that Crash sold his life story, titled [...] "The Color Orange", to a major film studio, set to be released by the Christmas season. In , Crash is recruited to gather Crystals to power a device built by Coco that will reverse the effects of Cortex's Planetary <b>Minimizer,</b> which has shrunken the Earth {{to the size of}} a grapefruit. In , Crash is awoken from his nap by the kidnapping of Coco and Crunch by Nefarious Tropy and N. Trance. Crash is almost kidnapped himself before being rescued by Aku Aku. He is then sent off to rescue Crunch and Coco, recruit Fake Crash, and defeat N. Trance and Nefarious Tropy. Crash is a playable character in Nitro Kart, in which he is abducted (along with other characters) by Emperor Velo XXVII and forced to compete in the Galaxy Circuit. When Velo relinquishes his power to Crash, Crash seriously considers the possibility of ruling over Velo's empire, but he refuses the offer and leaves Velo with his empire. In , Crash is tricked into thinking that Spyro the Dragon is attacking the Wumpa Islands, but he discovers the truth after a fight on a bridge, and teams up with Spyro to defeat the combined forces of Doctor Neo Cortex and Ripto. In Tag Team Racing, Crash is recruited (along with other characters) by Ebenezer Von Clutch to gather the stolen Power Gems of his amusement park and win the park's ownership. He also finds Von Clutch's lost Black Power Gem by the end of the game. Crash is a playable character in Boom Bang!, in which he interrupts the Viscount's wish to the Super Big Power Crystal and wishes for a vast amount of Wumpa Fruit.|$|E

40|$|Many {{estimation}} problems {{amount to}} minimizing an objective function {{composed of a}} quadratic data-fidelity term and a general regularization term. It is widely accepted that the <b>minimizers</b> obtained using nonsmooth and/or nonconvex regularization terms are frequently good estimates. However, very few facts are known on the ways to control properties of these <b>minimizers.</b> This work {{is dedicated to the}} stability of the <b>minimizers</b> of such nonsmooth and/or nonconvex objective functions. It consists of two parts: in this part, we focus on general local <b>minimizers,</b> whereas in a second part, we derive results on global <b>minimizers.</b> Here we demonstrate that the data domain contains an open, dense subset whose elements give rise to local and global <b>minimizers</b> which are necessarily strict. Moreover, we show that the relevant <b>minimizers</b> are stable under variations of the data...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{minimization}} {{problem on the}} L∞-norm functional over the divergence-free fields with given boundary normal component. We focus on the computation of the minimum value and the classification of certain special <b>minimizers</b> including the so-called absolute <b>minimizers.</b> In particular, several alternative approaches for computing the minimum value are given using Lq-approximations and the sets of finite perimeter. For problems in two dimensions, we establish the existence of absolute <b>minimizers</b> using a similar technique for the absolute <b>minimizers</b> of L∞-functionals of gradient fields. In some special cases, precise characterizations of all <b>minimizers</b> and the absolute <b>minimizers</b> are also given based on equivalent descriptions of the absolutely minimizing Lipschitz extensions of boundary functions...|$|R

Exploiting the quantitative fractional isoperimetric inequality, we show that balls are the unique <b>minimizers</b> if the volume is sufficiently small, depending on t − s, while the existence vs. nonexistence of <b>minimizers</b> for large volumes remains open. We also consider the corresponding isoperimetric problem and prove existence and regularity of <b>minimizers</b> for all s, t.

40|$|Finding {{the minimum}} and the <b>minimizers</b> of convex {{functions}} {{has been of}} primary concern in convex analysis since its conception. It is well-known that if a convex function has a minimum, then that minimum is global. The <b>minimizers,</b> however, may not be unique. There are certain subclasses, such as strictly convex functions, that do have unique <b>minimizers</b> when the minimum exists, but other subclasses, such as constant functions, that do not. This paper addresses {{the question of how}} many convex functions have unique <b>minimizers.</b> We show, using Baire category theory, that the set of proximal mappings of convex functions that have a unique fixed point is generic. Consequently, the set of classes of convex functions that have unique <b>minimizers</b> is generic...|$|R
