5|$|Images of <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> {{begin to}} appear in Mesopotamian {{artifacts}} in 2800 BC or earlier. Beginning around 2000 BC, Sumerian and Babylonian cultures began delineating two distinct classes of <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> due to division of labor and the evolving class system. Popular instruments, simple and playable by anyone, evolved differently from professional instruments whose development focused on effectiveness and skill. Despite this development, very few <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> have been recovered in Mesopotamia. Scholars must rely on artifacts and cuneiform texts written in Sumerian or Akkadian to reconstruct {{the early history of}} <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> in Mesopotamia. Even the process of assigning names to these instruments is challenging since there is no clear distinction among various instruments and the words used to describe them.|$|E
5|$|<b>Musical</b> <b>instruments</b> such as zithers {{appeared}} in Chinese writings around 12th century BC and earlier. Early Chinese philosophers such as Confucius (551–479 BC), Mencius (372–289 BC), and Laozi shaped {{the development of}} <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> in China, adopting an attitude toward music {{similar to that of}} the Greeks. The Chinese believed that music was an essential part of character and community, and developed a unique system of classifying their <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> according to their material makeup.|$|E
5|$|Researchers have {{discovered}} archaeological evidence of <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> {{in many parts}} of the world. Some finds are 67,000 years old, however their status as <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> is often in dispute. Consensus solidifies about artifacts dated back to around 37,000 years old and later. Only artifacts made from durable materials or using durable methods tend to survive. As such, the specimens found cannot be irrefutably placed as the earliest <b>musical</b> <b>instruments.</b>|$|E

A database of <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> sounds parameters was built for this purpose, which consists of <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> recordings and their parametric representation. The parameterization process was conceived and performed {{in order to find}} significant <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> sound features and to remove redundancy from the musical signal. Classification experiments of <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> sounds were performed with neural networks allowing a discussion of the feature extraction process efficiency and of its limitations. Conclusions and remarks concerning further development of this study and its relation to the current MPEG- 7 standardization process are included. ...|$|R

5|$|A musical {{instrument}} is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound {{can be considered}} a {{musical instrument}}—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. The history of <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> may have been used for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. <b>Musical</b> <b>instruments</b> evolved in step with changing applications.|$|E

5|$|Evidence of <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> in use {{by early}} civilizations of India is almost {{completely}} lacking, {{making it impossible}} to reliably attribute instruments to the Munda and Dravidian language-speaking cultures that first settled the area. Rather, the history of <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> in the area begins with the Indus Valley Civilization that emerged around 3000 BC. Various rattles and whistles found among excavated artifacts are the only physical evidence of <b>musical</b> <b>instruments.</b> A clay statuette indicates the use of drums, and examination of the Indus script has also revealed representations of vertical arched harps identical in design to those depicted in Sumerian artifacts. This discovery is among many indications that the Indus Valley and Sumerian cultures maintained cultural contact. Subsequent developments in <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> in India occurred with the Rigveda, or hymns. These songs used various drums, shell trumpets, harps, and flutes. Other prominent instruments in use during the early centuries AD were the snake charmer's double clarinet, bagpipes, barrel drums, cross flutes, and short lutes. In all, India had no unique <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> until the Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|Scholars {{agree that}} there are no {{completely}} reliable methods of determining the exact chronology of <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> across cultures. Comparing and organizing instruments based on their complexity is misleading, since advancements in <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> have sometimes reduced complexity.

5|$|Musical {{instrument}} {{construction is}} a specialized trade that requires years of training, practice, and sometimes an apprenticeship. Most makers of <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> specialize in one genre of instruments; for example, a luthier makes only stringed instruments. Some make only {{one type of}} instrument such as a piano. Whatever the instrument constructed, the instrument maker must consider materials, construction technique, and decoration, creating a balanced instrument that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Some builders are focused on a more artistic approach and develop experimental <b>musical</b> <b>instruments,</b> often meant for individual playing styles developed by the builder himself.|$|E

5|$|<b>Musical</b> <b>instruments</b> {{developed}} independently in many populated {{regions of}} the world. However, contact among civilizations caused rapid spread and adaptation of most instruments in places far from their origin. By the Middle Ages, instruments from Mesopotamia were in maritime Southeast Asia, and Europeans played instruments from North Africa. Development in the Americas occurred at a slower pace, but cultures of North, Central, and South America shared <b>musical</b> <b>instruments.</b> By 1400, musical instrument development slowed in many areas and was dominated by the Occident.|$|E

5|$|The use of <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> in worship was a {{divisive}} topic within the Stone-Campbell Movement from its earliest years, when some adherents opposed the practice on scriptural grounds, while {{others may have}} relied on a cappella simply because they lacked access to <b>musical</b> <b>instruments.</b> Alexander Campbell opposed the use of instruments in worship. As early as 1855, some Restoration Movement churches were using organs or pianos, ultimately leading the Churches of Christ to separate from the groups that condoned instrumental music.|$|E
