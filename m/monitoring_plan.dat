[...] The first revision to the <b>monitoring</b> <b>plan</b> was done in order to mimic the <b>monitoring</b> <b>plan</b> for similar projects. [...] Specifically, the plant diversity was to be quantified every three years {{in order to determine}} vegetative health of the area. [...] Also, the salinity was to be monitored continuously through 2005. The second revision to the <b>monitoring</b> <b>plan</b> was done in accordance with the Breaux Act.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{detection}} of communication outbreaks among a small team of actors in time-varying networks. We propose <b>monitoring</b> <b>plans</b> for known and unknown teams based on generalizations of the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) statistic. For unknown teams, we propose an efficient neighborhood-based search to estimate a collection of candidate teams. This procedure dramatically reduces the computational complexity of an exhaustive search. Our procedure consists of two steps: communication counts between actors are first smoothed using a multivariate EWMA strategy. Densely connected teams are identified as candidates using a neighborhood search approach. These candidate teams are then monitored using a surveillance plan derived from a generalized EWMA statistic. <b>Monitoring</b> <b>plans</b> are established for collaborative teams, teams with a dominant leader, {{as well as for}} global outbreaks. We consider weighted heterogeneous dynamic networks, where the expected communication count between each pair of actors is potentially different across pairs and time, as well as homogeneous networks, where the expected communication count is constant across time and actors. Our <b>monitoring</b> <b>plans</b> are evaluated on a test bed of simulated networks {{as well as on the}} U. S. Senate co-voting network, which models the Senate voting patterns from 1857 to 2015. Our analysis suggests that our surveillance strategies can efficiently detect relevant and significant changes in dynamic networks. Comment: 23 pages, 2 figures, Submitte...|$|R
