40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the issue of <b>multiparasitism,</b> with a special {{emphasis}} on its characteristics, its extent in eastern Asia and its significance for infectious disease control. <b>Multiparasitism</b> is pervasive among socially and economically disadvantaged or marginalised communities, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. Intestinal parasites are the most numerous group, but an array of parasites is located elsewhere than in the human gastrointestinal tract. Although <b>multiparasitism</b> has been recognised for decades, in-depth studies are rare, and its public health and economic implications have yet to be fully elucidated. The assessment of <b>multiparasitism</b> is hampered by a lack of sensitive broad-spectrum diagnostic tools and the need to collect multiple biological samples for detailed appraisal. Non-specific symptoms and mainly subtle effects complicate the appreciation of its influence on cognitive and physical development, health, economic productivity and general well-being. <b>Multiparasitism</b> has been reported from virtually every eastern Asian country, and studies regarding the extent of <b>multiparasitism</b> and its effects on child health have been implemented in the region. However, new research is needed, as no comprehensive evaluations of <b>multiparasitism</b> in eastern Asia could be identified. Two case studies pertaining to <b>multiparasitism</b> at the local and regional scale are presented. <b>Multiparasitism</b> was rampant in an ethnic minority village in southern People's Republic of China where the challenges associated with its thorough evaluation are illustrated. The results from a cross-sectional survey covering 35 villages highlight the significance of its evaluation for the design of locally adapted and sustainable parasite control and poverty alleviation programmes. We conclude by listing a set of research needs for future investigation...|$|E
40|$|Multiparasitism: pervasive, yet seldom {{considered}} In {{the present}} context, <b>multiparasitism</b> (synonymous: polyparasitism) {{is defined as}} the concurrent presence of different parasite species in a single host. Parasites are members of the helminth, protozoa and arthropod families. Some studies also consider bacteria, fungi and viruses (1) but since the latter organisms fall outside traditional parasitology, they are not considered here. The most diverse parasite community is usually found in the digestive tract, and the collection of stool specimens is more straightforward due to its non-invasive nature than that of certain other biological samples, e. g. blood, cerebrospinal fluid and tissues. Intestinal <b>multiparasitism</b> has therefore been studied more often and in greater detail than <b>multiparasitism</b> in general. This has resulted in some inconsistency in the usage of terms, “multiparasitism ” sometimes being used when in fact “intestinal <b>multiparasitism</b> ” is referred to. The most common human parasites are soil-transmitted helminths (Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and the hookworms (Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus), Plasmodium spp., Schistosoma spp. and lymph-dwelling filariae...|$|E
40|$|Most parasites co-occur {{with other}} parasites, {{although}} {{the importance of}} such <b>multiparasitism</b> has only recently been recognised. Co-infections may result when hosts are independently infected by different parasites {{at the same time}} or when interactions among parasite species facilitate co-occurrence. Such interactions can have important repercussions on human or animal health because they can alter host susceptibility, infection duration, transmission risks, and clinical symptoms. These interactions may be synergistic or antagonistic and thus produce diverse effects in infected humans and animals. Interactions among parasites strongly influence parasite dynamics and therefore {{play a major role in}} structuring parasite populations (both within and among hosts) as well as host populations. However, several methodological challenges remain when it comes to detecting parasite interactions. The goal of this review is to summarise current knowledge on the causes and consequences of <b>multiparasitism</b> and to discuss the different methods and tools that researchers have developed to study the factors that lead to <b>multiparasitism.</b> It also identifies new research directions to pursue...|$|E
40|$|Helminth {{infections are}} {{believed}} to be common in tropical and subtropical countries. A cross-sectional study was carried out in two villages located in Guichi District in Anhui Province, the People’s Republic of China, where <b>multiparasitism</b> was investigated using parasitological tests. The data collected were fitted to Bayesian multi-level models to profile risk factors for helminth infections. The prevalence of Schistosoma (S.) japonicum, Ascaris (A.) lumbricoides and Trichuris (T.) trichiura were 0. 43 % (range: 0 - 0. 87 % at the village level), 2. 28 % (range: 1. 69 - 2. 88 %), and 0. 21 % (range: 0 - 0. 42 %), respectively. No hookworm infection was found. With regard to <b>multiparasitism,</b> only a 33 -year-old female was found to be co-infected with S. japonicum and A. lumbricoides. <b>Multiparasitism</b> was unexpectedly rare in the study area, which contrasts with results from other studies carried out elsewhere in the country. The long-term usage of albendazole for individuals serologically positive for schistosomiasis may be the main reason, but this needs to be confirmed by future studies...|$|E
40|$|Background: Detailed {{investigations}} of <b>multiparasitism</b> are scarce in the Mekong River basin. We assessed helminth (trematode, nematode, and cestode), and intestinal protozoa infections, and <b>multiparasitism</b> in random population samples {{from three different}} eco-epidemiological settings in Champasack province, southern Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and determined underlying risk factors. Methodology: Two stool samples were collected from 669 individuals aged $ 6 months over consecutive days and examined for helminth infections using the Kato-Katz method. Additionally, one stool sample per person was subjected to a formalin-ethyl acetate concentration technique for diagnosis of helminth and intestinal protozoa infections. Questionnaires were administered to obtain individual and household-level data pertaining to behavior, demography and socioeconomic status. Risk factors for hepato-biliary and intestinal parasitic infections and <b>multiparasitism</b> were determined using multiple logistic regressions analyses. Principal Findings: Multiple species intestinal parasite infections were common: 86. 6 % of the study participants harbored at least two and up to seven different parasites concurrently. Regarding nematode infections, hookworm was the most prevalent species (76. 8 %), followed by Ascaris lumbricoides (31. 7 %) and Trichuris trichiura (25. 0 %). Regarding trematodes, Opisthorchis viverrini and Schistosoma mekongi infections were found in 64. 3 % and 24. 2 % of the participants, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Intestinal <b>multiparasitism,</b> the {{accuracy}} of different diagnostic techniques, {{and the influence of}} sampling effort were studied among 215 individuals in a Bulang village, Yunnan province, People’s Republic of China. Behavioral, demographic, and socioeconomic data were obtained by questionnaire. Multiple stool specimens were examined by the Kato–Katz, Koga agar plate, Baermann, and ether–concentration methods. Eight helminth and 7 protozoa species were diagnosed. The prevalence of each of the 3 main soil-transmitted helminths (Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura) exceeded 85 %. Blastocystis hominis was the most prevalent intestinal protozoan (20. 0 %). Over 80 % of the individuals harbored 3 or more intestinal parasites concurrently. The infection intensities were predominantly light for hookworm and T. trichiura but moderate for A. lumbricoides. Examination of 3 instead of 1 stool specimen increased the sensitivity of helminth diagnosis, most notably for hookworm.

40|$|Multiparsitism is {{a general}} public health concern in {{tropical}} countries, and is of particular importance in the Mekong River basin of Southeast Asia. Here, we report results obtained from an in-depth study of hepato-biliary and intestinal <b>multiparasitism</b> and associated risk factors in three settings of the most southern province of Lao People's Democratic Republic. Multiple species intestinal parasite infections were very common: more than 80 % of the study participants harbored at least two and up to seven different intestinal parasites concurrently. Of particular concerns are the high prevalence of the liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini (64. 1 %) and the moderate prevalence of the blood fluke Schistosoma mekongi (24. 2 %), as these fluke infections are responsible for severe hepato-biliary morbidity, including the bile duct cancer cholangiocarcinoma. Hookworm {{was the most common}} nematode infection (76. 8 %). We conclude that given the very high prevalence rates of parasite infections and the extent of <b>multiparasitism,</b> regular deworming is warranted and that this intervention should be coupled with health education and improved assess to clean water and adequate sanitation to consolidate morbidity control and ensure long-term sustainability...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Recent population-dynamic theory {{suggests}} that mechanisms of lethal interference competition can have profound effects on parasitoid coexistence and pest sup-pression in biological control systems. We investigated lethal intraspecific and interspecific interference compe-tition in Eretmocerus eremicus and Encarsia sophia, parasitoids of the whitefly pest, Bemisia tabaci. Our first experiments evaluated whether one or both species could suppress the progeny production of the other species through two mechanisms of lethal interference competi-tion: (1) usurpation of hosts in cases of <b>multiparasitism,</b> and (2) host feeding on and killing parasitised hosts. We found that both species could suppress the progeny pro-duction of the other. E. eremicus ’ effect on E. sophia appeared to reflect <b>multiparasitism.</b> E. sophia’s effect on E. eremicus appeared to reflect a combination of multi-parasitism and host feeding on parasitised hosts. Second, we investigated the effects of lethal intraspecific interfer-ence on conspecific progeny production in both species. E. sophia interfered intraspecifically by host feeding on parasitised hosts. E. eremicus also apparently host fed on parasitised hosts, however the effect of host feeding on conspecific progeny production was slight. Third, host dissections and behavioral observations confirmed the mechanisms inferred from the progeny production exper-iments. Our results suggest a need to consider mecha-nisms of lethal interference competition in theoretical and empirical research on parasitoid competition...|$|E
40|$|Coexistence or {{displacement}} of parasitoids in hosts during intrinsic competitive interactions between different parasitoid species (<b>multiparasitism)</b> {{may depend on}} their life history traits and behavior. Intense competition for possession of hosts {{may lead to the}} elimination of the inferior competitor through physical attack and/or physiological suppression. However, the mechanisms of physiological suppression during <b>multiparasitism</b> remain unclear. Previous work has shown that first instar larvae of the solitary endoparasitoid Meteorus pulchricornis possess well-developed mandibles that are used to kill competitors. Two gregarious endoparasitoids, Cotesia kariyai and C. rufricus, share host resources especially when the time gap of oviposition is short. Here, we investigated the physiological influence of wasp-regulatory factors of the three endoparasitoids, M. pulchricornis, C. kariyai, and C. ruficrus, in their common host Mythimna separata. We found that MpVLP alone (or with venom) deleteriously affected the development of the two gregarious species. Similarly, CkPDV plus venom had toxic effect on M. pulchricornis eggs and immature larvae, although they were not harmful to immature stages of C. ruficrus. Cotesia kariyai and C. ruficrus were able to coexist mainly through the expression of regulatory factors and both could successfully emerge from a multiparasitized host. The injection of CkPDV plus venom after oviposition in L 5 host larvae facilitated C. ruficrus development and increased the rate of successful parasitism from 9 % to 62 %. This suggests that the two gregarious parasitoid wasps exhibit strong phylogenetic affinity, favoring their coexistence and success in multiparasitized hosts. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{and spatial}} distribution of intestinal helminth infection in children is fairly well understood. However, knowledge on how helminth infections govern intestinal morbidity is scarce. We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess and quantify the relationship between single and multiple species helminth infection with clinical and self-reported morbidity indicators and nutritional status in Champasack province, southern Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). A random sample of 1313 children, aged 6 months to 12 years, from villages in nine rural districts were enrolled and examined for helminth infection using duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears. Morbidity was assessed by self-reported symptoms, coupled with clinical examination and appraisal of nutritional status and anaemia. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression was employed to study associations between helminth infection and morbidity indicators and anaemia. We found considerable morbidity among the surveyed children, including hepatomegaly (13. 7 %), pale conjunctiva (13. 2 %) and abdominal pain (10. 4 %). Anaemia was recorded in 60. 4 % of the children, whilst signs of stunting and low body mass index (BMI) were observed in 49. 8 % and 33. 3 % of the surveyed children, respectively. Hookworm and Opisthorchis viverrini were the predominant helminth species with prevalences of 51. 0 % and 43. 3 %, respectively. The prevalence of Schistosoma mekongi in the surveyed children was 5. 6 %. Multiple species helminth infections were recorded in 40. 4 % of the study cohort. Morbidity was associated with specific helminth species infection (e. g. S. mekongi with hepatomegaly; adjusted odds ratio (aOR) : 9. 49, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 2. 07 - 43. 51) and <b>multiparasitism</b> (e. g. two or more helminth species with abdominal pain; aOR: 2. 40, 95 % CI: 1. 46 - 3. 93). Anaemia was associated with hookworm infection (aOR: 1. 64, 95 % CI: 1. 16 - 2. 34) and <b>multiparasitism</b> (aOR: 1. 64, 95 % CI: 1. 18 - 2. 29). Low BMI was associated with viverrini infection (aOR: 1. 68, 95 % CI: 1. 14 - 2. 49) and <b>multiparasitism</b> (aOR: 1. 42, 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 2. 00). The multiple strong associations reported here between helminth infections (single or multiple species) and intestinal morbidity among children in rural parts of southern Lao PDR call for concerted efforts to control helminth infections, which in turn might improve children's health and development...|$|E
40|$|In nature, {{most species}} of Lepidoptera are {{attacked}} by parasitoids, and some species may be hosts for several parasitoid species. When hosts are parasitized {{by more than}} one female of the same species (=superparasitism) or females of different species (=multiparasitism), then intrinsic competition occurs for control of host resources. To reduce competition, some parasitoids are able to recognize the difference between parasitized and unparasitized hosts. Inter- and intra-specific host discrimination were investigated in the two sympatric species, the gregarious Cotesia kariyai (Watanabe) and solitary Meteorus pulchricornis (Wesmael), endoparasitoids of the Oriental armyworm Mythimna separata (Walker). To measure host discrimination, choice experiments were conducted in which females of both species foraged and chose between healthy host larvae and hosts initially parasitized by either C. kariyai or M. pulchricornis. An olfactory test was also performed to examine the discrimination behavior of the two parasitoids. Our results showed that, in oviposition choice tests, both braconid female wasps were able to discriminate between unparasitized hosts and from four to seven day-old hosts previously attacked by conspecific and heterospecific wasps. On the other hand, superparasitism and <b>multiparasitism</b> occurred even in host larvae that were parasitized two days earlier. However, once the immature parasitoids hosts are at larval stage (1 st and 2 nd instar), super- and <b>multiparasitism</b> were avoided in the two-choice test, but the latter often occurred in the multiple-choice experiment. Host discrimination abilities may have been based on plant volatile signals incurred from damaged plants and internal mechanisms from four to seven post-parasitized hosts. ...|$|E
40|$|Host {{discrimination}} {{studies were}} conducted with different species of Asobara, which are larval endo-parasitoids of Drosophilidae. Results indicated variable host discrimination which depended on the relatedness of the species. The closely related sibling species Asobara tabida (Nees) and A. rufescens (Foerster) were not only capable of intraspecific discrimination, but also avoided <b>multiparasitism</b> by discriminating between unparasitized host larvae and larvae previously parasitized by females of the other species. This ability to discriminate interspecifically does not seem functional as each species occupies its own microhabitat. As it was shown to be absent in less closely related Asobara species we concluded that interspecific discrimination by A. tabida and A. rufescens was due to their close relationship...|$|E

40|$|Nineteen {{roe deer}} coming from Julian Prealps were {{investigated}} {{for the presence}} of abomasal nematodes. An anatomopathological analysis was also carried out. S. spiculoptera and O. leptospicularis, with their alternative morphs S. mathevossiani and O. kolchida, were the abomasal dominant species. Eleven helminthic species (as average 5. 5 species/animal) were recovered. Therefore, composition of the species was typical of this wild ruminant host in Europe. Between generalist species, Haemonchus contortus shows a high prevalence and abundance (P= 89. 5; A= 167). Due to abomasal <b>multiparasitism,</b> {{it was not possible to}} attribute to a single specie the anatomopathological patterns recovered.

40|$|Leptopilina heterotoma (Thomson) and Asobara tabida (Nees), solitary endoparasitoids of frugivorous Drosophila larvae, {{are assumed}} to be competitors. Olfactometer {{experiments}} showed, however, that the species differ in their preference for microhabitat odours. Whereas A. tabida prefers a fresh fermenting sugar/yeast medium, L. heterotoma prefers this medium in a later stage of decay. These results are confirmed by field observations. This temporal separation between the species, which is not complete because some <b>multiparasitism</b> does occur, {{may be one of the}} factors to their coexistence. Odour preference in L. heterotoma is not modified by larval conditioning, but conditioning of the adults significantly influenced their odour response. The ecological significance of such learning is discussed. It is argued that even though such behavioural flexibility may enhance foraging efficiency when resources are unpredictable, it may also influence the amount of competition between the two parasitoid species. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{foraging}} {{behavior of}} Amitus fuscipennis MacGown & Nebeker and Encarsia formosa Gahan was studied on tomato leaflets with 20 Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) larvae {{in the first}} or third stage. Ten of the whitefly larvae were previously parasitized and contained a conspecific or a heterospecific parasitoid egg or larva. The host type (host stage and/or previous parasitization) did not influence the foraging behavior of either parasitoid species. The residence time on these tomato leaflets was about 0. 9 h for A. fuscipennis and 1. 9 h for E. formosa. Amitus fuscipennis hardly stood still and fed little, while E. formosa showed extensive standing still and feeding. As a result, the time walking while drumming was similar for both parasitoid species. The numbers of host encounters and ovipositions per leaflet were similar for both parasitoid species. However, the residence time of A. fuscipennis was half {{as long as that}} of E. formosa so the rate of encounters and ovipositions was higher for A. fuscipennis. Amitus fuscipennis is more efficient in finding and parasitizing hosts under these conditions. The walking activity and host acceptance of the synovigenic E. formosa diminished with the number of ovipositions, but not those of the proovigenic A. fuscipennis. Encarsia formosa is egg limited, while A. fuscipennis is time limited because of its short life span and high egg load. Both parasitoid species discriminated well between unparasitized larvae and self-parasitized larvae, but discriminated poorly those larvae parasitized by a conspecific and did not discriminate larvae parasitized by a heterospecific. Self-superparasitism, conspecific superparasitism, and <b>multiparasitism</b> were observed for both parasitoid species. Superparasitism always resulted in the emergence of one parasitoid and <b>multiparasitism</b> resulted in a higher emergence of one parasitoid of the species that had parasitized first. The data suggest that A. fuscipennis is a good candidate for use in biological control of high-density spots of T. vaporariorum when we consider its high encounter and oviposition rate...|$|E
40|$|Parasitoid Nasonia wasps {{adjust their}} progeny sex ratio to the {{presence}} of conspecifics to optimize their fitness. Another trait under female control is the induction of offspring diapause. We analysed progeny sex ratios and the proportion of diapausing offspring of individual Nasonia females in host patches parasitized by two species, Nasonia vitripennis and Nasonia giraulti, in North American field populations using microsatellite fingerprinting. Both Nasonia species produced similar sex ratios on hosts that were co-parasitized by their own species as by the other species, indicating that females do not distinguish between con- and heterospecific clutches. The sex ratios of the diapause and adult fractions of mixed broods from single females were not correlated. We found further indications that N. vitripennis females take the emergence time of the offspring into account in their sex allocation. The reproductive strategies of Nasonia under <b>multiparasitism</b> are largely adaptive, but also partially constrained by information. ...|$|E

Mortality of N. viridula eggs was higher in simultaneous and sequential releases compared to single species releases. In simultaneous host exploitations, T. basalis females displayed an aggressive behavior against O. telenomicida females. The outcome of <b>multiparasitism</b> showed that interspecific larval competition was dominated by O. telenomicida regardless of the sequence in which oviposition occurred and which parasitoid was or was not simultaneously released in the patch. Finally, O. telenomicida can successfully develop in hosts already parasitized by T. basalis up to seven days earlier, acting as a facultative hyperparasitoid, so that intraguild predation (IGP) also occurred.

40|$|Background: Domestic cats can be infested {{by a large}} {{range of}} {{parasite}} species. Parasitic infestations may cause very different clinical signs. Endoparasites and ectoparasites are rarely explored in the same study and therefore <b>multiparasitism</b> is poorly documented.

Methods: From March 2012 to May 2013, 1519 owned cats were included in a multicenter study conducted in 9 veterinary faculties throughout Europe (Austria, Belgium, France, Hungary, Italy, Romania and Spain). For each cat, ectoparasites were checked by combing of the coat surface associated with otoscopic evaluation and microscopy on cerumen samples. Endoparasites were identified by standard coproscopical examinations performed on fresh faecal samples. Risk factors and their influence on parasitism were evaluated by univariate analysis followed by a multivariate statistical analysis (including center of examination, age, outdoor access, multipet status, and frequency of treatments as main criteria) with logistic regression models.

In Brazil, enteroparasites are one of the main public health issues. The present study aims at analyzing the distribution and frequency of enteroparasite occurrence in 635 children from seven community schools in the city of Guarapuava, Paraná (PR). In addition, we used similarity and diversity indices to analyze the parasite community. We found 475 samples with at least one parasite showing that 75. 27 % of children had enteroparasites. A smaller fraction (26. 73 %) of children harbored several parasites (<b>multiparasitism),</b> especially Giardia duodenalis (56 %), and Ascaris lumbricoides (18 %).

40|$|Abstract. A {{cross-sectional}} study of cryptosporidiosis {{was carried out}} in Nicaragua. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection was determined in 272 (110 boys and 162 girls) schoolchildren, aged between 4 to 15 years from department of Rio San Juan. The total percentage obtained for Cryptosporidium (35. 7 %) was one of the highest reported so far. Cryptosporidium appeared in 94. 8 % of <b>multiparasitism</b> cases. No significant statistical differences were detected in the cryptosporidiosis prevalence between loose/watery (22. 2 %) and soft/formed (36. 7 %) stool samples. No significant age and sex differences were observed. This is the first report to identify Cryptosporidium in Nicaragua at species level, providing a preliminary molecular characterization of all positive samples, such as Cryptosporidium parvum (genotype 2). The high prevalence of C. parvum suggests that animals may be potential sources of infection for human cryptosporidiosis, although C. parvum infections may have originated from humans themselves.

40|$|Most organisms show {{self-sustained}} circadian oscillations {{or biological}} clocks which control their daily fluctuations in behavioural and physiological activities. While extensive {{progress has been}} made in understanding the molecular mechanisms of biological clocks, there have been few clear demonstrations of the fitness value of endogenous rhythms. This study investigated the adaptive significance of circadian rhythms in a Drosophila parasitoid community. The activity rhythms of three sympatric Drosophila parasitoids are out of phase, the competitively inferior parasitoid species being active earlier than the superior competitor. This temporal segregation appears at least partially determined by endogenous periods of the clock which also vary between species and which correlate the time of activity. This earlier activity of the inferior competitor significantly reduces its intrinsic competitive disadvantage when <b>multiparasitism</b> occurs, thus suggesting that natural selection acting on the phase of the rhythm could substantially deviate the endogenous period from the optimal ca. 24 h period. This study demonstrates that temporal segregation of competing species could be endogenously controlled, which undoubtedly favours their coexistence in nature and also shows how natural selection can act on biological clocks to shape daily activity patterns...|$|E

European Peristenus digoneutis Loan and P. relictus Ruthe (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) are being considered for release in Canada as part of a classical biological control program for Lygus. The attractiveness of different host plants to European Peristenus has not been addressed, but may be an important consideration prior to parasitoid release. Lygus rugulipennis Poppius nymphs were collected in the Northern Temperate Atlantic (NTA) ecoregion on red clover (Trifolium pratense L.; Fabaceae) and chamomile (Matricaria recutita L.; Asteraceae), and in the Western European Broadleaf Forest (WEBF) ecoregion on red clover and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.; Fabaceae). Parasitism levels and parasitoid species were determined using a multiplex PCR assay for P. digoneutis, P. relictus, and P. pallipes Curtis. Mean parasitism levels in L. rugulipennis were 45 - 49 % in the NTA ecoregion and 25 - 32 % in the WEBF ecoregion.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ability of}} a {{parasitoid}} to evolve enhanced counterdefenses against host resistance and its possible costs were studied in a Drosophila-parasitoid system. We reared Asobara tabida (Braconidae, Hymenoptera) exclusively on D. melanogaster to impose artificial selection for improved counterdefenses against cellular encapsulation, the main host defense against parasitism. Controls were reared on D. subobscura, the main host {{of the population of}} wasps from which the laboratory culture was derived and a species that never encapsulates parasitoids. We observed improved survival and avoidance of encapsulation in all five selection lines compared to their paired control lines, although there was unexpected variation among pairs. Improved survival was associated with parasitoid eggs becoming embedded in host tissue, where they were protected from circulating haemocytes. There were no differences among lines in average adult size, fat content, egg load, or performance on D. subobscura. However, the duration of the egg stage in selection lines was longer than that of control lines, probably because of reduced nutrient and/or oxygen supply when eggs are embedded in host tissue. We suggest that this delay in hatching reduces the probability of parasitoid survival if another parasitoid egg is laid in the same host (superparasitism or <b>multiparasitism)</b> and hence is a cost of enhanced counterdefenses against host resistance. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Haplodiploid Hymenoptera females {{control the}} sex of their progeny, and their sex {{allocation}} is influenced by several factors. The impact of intra- and interspecific competition and of inbreeding and outbreeding on sex allocation has been studied in some species of the egg parasitoid Trichogramma. The pre-mating dispersion has also been studied. Impact of competition on sex allocation was observed for Trichogramma minutum Riley and Trichogramma pintoi Voegele. These species were chosen because of {{the ease with which}} than can be distinguish. Results show that females of both species lay more males under intraspecific competition than alone, following the Local Mate Competition theory, while only T. pintoi modifies its sex ratio under interspecific competition. <b>Multiparasitism</b> and natural habitat could explain this shift in the sex ratio. Trichogramma minutum, T. pintoi and Trichogramma evanescens Westwood pre-mating dispersion show that most matings occur at the emergence site. However, the three species have a potential for off-patch mating, allowing genetic exchange between sub-populations. These three species were chosen because they are classified in different groups in the genus. Finally, T. evanescens did not modify its sex ratio following inbreeding or outbreeding. The incapacity to discriminate between kin and non-kin, insufficient genetic distance in outbreeding, or the population structure could explain these results...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the intestinal parasite prevalence in puppies from six different kennels; four kennels were in Guadalajara and Zapopan cities (Jalisco State) and two kennels were in Mexico City. From October 2006 to November 2007, we collected 441 fecal samples from 147 puppies, both male and female, ranging from 1 to 36 months of age. Three samples from every puppy were analyzed by using the Faust technique. The prevalence found were as follows: Giardia intestinalis (genotype A and B) 6. 8 %; Cystoisospora 21. 08 %; Uncinaria 7. 48 %; Toxocara canis 12. 29 % and <b>multiparasitism</b> (Giardia, Toxocara and Uncinaria) 4. 76 %. The highest prevalence for both Giardia and Cystoisospora were found in 2 - 3 - month-old puppies; the highest prevalence for Toxocara canis was found in 3 - 4 -month-old puppies. In the kennels of Mexico City we found mainly Giardia intestinalis, Cystoisospora to be most prevalent in Zapopan and Toxocara canis in Guadalajara. The high prevalence of intestinal parasites found in this study demonstrates an increased risk for infection in humans, as these animals are usually a common pet in many homes. This zoonotic phenomenon represents an important health problem for any community...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} a {{parasitoid}} to evolve enhanced counterdefenses against host resistance and its possible costs were studied in a Drosophila-parasitoid system. We reared Asobara tabida (Braconidae, Hymenoptera) exclusively on D. melanogaster to impose artificial selection for improved counterdefenses against cellular encapsulation, the main host defense against parasitism. Controls were reared on D. subobscura, the main host {{of the population of}} wasps from which the laboratory culture was derived and a species that never encapsulates parasitoids. We observed improved survival and avoidance of encapsulation in all five selection lines compared to their paired control lines, although there was unexpected variation among pairs. Improved survival was associated with parasitoid eggs becoming embedded in host tissue, where they were protected from circulating haemocytes. There were no differences among lines in average adult size, fat content, egg load, or performance on D. subobscura. However, the duration of the egg stage in selection lines was longer than that of control lines, probably because of reduced nutrient and/or oxygen supply when eggs are embedded in host tissue. We suggest that this delay in hatching reduces the probability of parasitoid survival if another parasitoid egg is laid in the same host (superparasitism or <b>multiparasitism)</b> and hence is a cost of enhanced counterdefenses against host resistance...|$|E
40|$|Interspecific {{competition}} amongst parasitoids {{is important}} in shaping the evolution of life-history strategies in these insects as well as community structure. Competition for hosts may occur between adult female parasitoids (‘extrinsic’ competition) or their progeny (‘intrinsic’ competition). Here, we examined intrinsic competition between two solitary secondary hyperparasitoids, Lysibia nana and Gelis agilis in cocoons of a primary parasitoid, Cotesia glomerata. Each species was allowed to sting hosts previously parasitized by the other at 24 h time intervals {{over the course of}} 144 h (6 days). When hosts were attacked simultaneously, neither species was dominant although the species to attack first won most encounters when it had a 24 – 48 h head start. However, after this time there was dramatic shift in the outcome with G. agilis dominating in all hosts > 72 -h old, regardless of which species had parasitized C. glomerata first. G. agilis larvae, which initially had competed with L. nana for control of C. glomerata resources, began attacking the larvae of L. nana, whereas L. nana rejected hosts with older G. agilis larvae or pupae. Effects of <b>multiparasitism</b> also affected the development time and adult mass of the winning parasitoid. Our results reveal a shift in the trophic status of G. agilis from C. glomerata (in younger hosts) to L. nana (in older hosts), the first time such a phenomenon has been reported in parasitoid...|$|E
40|$|Intraguild {{interactions}} between two egg parasitoids, Trissolcus basalis (Wollaston) and Ooencyrtus telenomicida (Vassiliev) exploring egg {{masses of the}} Southern Green Stink Bug Nezara viridula (L.) were investigated in field and semi-field conditions. Field trials were conducted in tomato fields by using sentinel and naturally laid egg masses in 2010 and 2011. Egg parasitoids monitoring, by sentinel egg masses placed weekly on plants during the tomato growing season and recollected one week later, showed that T. basalis occurs from June to October, whereas O. telenomicida occurs mainly in July and August. In the same fields, collections of naturally laid egg masses display different types of parasitized egg masses: only by T. basalis, only by O. telenomicida and by both species. The outcomes showed that T. basalis achieves a higher impact on the host population than O. telenomicida, even when <b>multiparasitism</b> occurs. Semi-field trials were conducted from July to September 2011, using pepper plants covered with mesh net {{in order to create}} small cages with five plants inside. In each cage, egg masses were placed on four plants located near to the cage corners and then T. basalis and O. telenomicida were released individually or simultaneously on the central plants. Egg masses were recollected after one week. The results showed that T. basalis achieves a high parasitization level when released alone but suffers competition by O. telenomicida when both species were simultaneously released...|$|E
40|$|Intraguild {{interactions}} {{can play}} a role in species coexistence and in sizing and shaping community structures. In addition, understanding how competitive interactions between parasitoid guilds can affect pest suppression may improve biological control. Interspecific competitive effects can be divided in “extrinsic competition”, the indirect interactions between adult females searching for or exploiting hosts, and “intrinsic competition”, the competition that occurs between larvae developing in the same host. In this work we performed both laboratory and field investigations to address on intraguild interactions occurring between Trissolcus basalis (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) and Ooencyrtus telenomicida (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), two egg parasitoids of the Southern Green Stink Bug, Nezara viridula (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae). These parasitoid species can exploit the same host egg mass and they naturally co-occur from fields. In laboratory conditions, bioassays were developed to study 1) extrinsic competition via comparative host location strategies and 2) intrinsic competition by investigating the outcome of <b>multiparasitism.</b> Field investigations were conducted 1) to score the “discovery efficiency”, the “parasitism efficiency” and the “parasitoid impact” of both species using N. viridula egg masses naturally laid in the fields; 2) to assess the seasonal occurrence and abundance of parasitoid species from sentinel N. viridula egg masses artificially placed in the fields. Results are discussed in terms of ecological factors that play a role in coexistence of competing species (counterbalanced-competition) and the influence of intraguild interaction in biological control...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} the parasites responsible for intestinal parasitic infections diagnosed at Le Dantec University Hospital of Dakar, distribution of parasites detected in stool samples of patients was studied. From 2011 to 2015, 2578 patients {{were included in}} the study. A direct examination and Ritchie technique were performed as parasite search techniques. In total, 408 samples were positive showing 440 intestinal parasites; this corresponds to prevalence of 15. 8 %. Parasites were detected in monoparasitism (85. 7 %) and <b>multiparasitism</b> (14. 3 %). The most common species found in monoparasitism were Entamoeba coli (38. 9 %), E. histolytica/dispar (12. 7 %), Giardia intestinalis (8 %), and Ascaris lumbricoides (7. 3 %). The most common associations were A. lumbricoides-Trichuris trichiura (3. 6 %) and E. coli-G. intestinalis (2. 7 %). Nonhospitalized patients were significantly more affected with 65. 4 % compared to hospitalized counterparts; and also there were more men (50. 7 %) than women. With 67. 4 %, adults were the most affected age group, while the elderly were less affected with only 7 % (p= 0. 5). This study shows increasing prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections over the years. So health education should be promoted in addition to the already begun mass treatment program. This would help to limit or even halt the spread of these diseases...|$|E
40|$|Interspecific {{competitions}} among parasitoids {{can affect}} community structures, and, {{as a consequence}} at applicative level, biological control programs. For example, competitions can cause local displacement of inferior species or niche separation. However, the coexistence of species attacking the same host is possible when they adopt different strategies to exploit the resource. In this work we evaluated in field and semi-field conditions intraguild interactions between two egg parasitoids, Trissolcus basalis and Ooencyrtus telenomicida exploring egg masses of Nezara viridula. In semi-field trials, pepper plants were covered with mesh net creating small cages with five plants inside. In each cage, egg masses were placed on plants and then T. basalis and O. telenomicida were released individually or simultaneously. After one week egg masses were recollected. The results showed that T. basalis achieves a high parasitism level when released alone but suffers competition by O. telenomicida in case of simultaneous releasing. Field trials were conducted in tomato fields from May to October in two consecutive years, by monitoring 8 sentinel egg masses placed weekly on plants and recollected one week later, and by collecting naturally laid egg masses that were parasitized only by T. basalis, only by O. telenomicida or by both species. The outcomes showed that T. basalis occurs from June to October, whereas O. telenomicida mainly in July and August, and the former achieves a higher impact on the natural host population than the latter, even when <b>multiparasitism</b> occurs. The ecological role of these results is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Most insects harbour a {{community}} of parasitoids that coexist in spite of competition for resources. One potential mechanism for coexistence of competitors is a tradeoff between dispersiveness and local competitive ability. Here we present a study of competition between the specialized parasitoids Hyposoter horticola and Cotesia melitaearum sharing the Glanville fritillary butterfly, Melitaea cinxia. Within one host generation, the parasitoid larvae interact inside the host during {{each of the three}} C. melitaearum generations. We founds that in the summer when the host is small, the solitary H. horticola is the superior competitor, suppressing the gregarious C. melitaearum as eggs or small larvae. When <b>multiparasitism</b> occurs in the autumn the two parasitoid species engage in physical combat and C. melitaearum is favoured. Finally, a previous study showed that in the third C. melitaearum generation the univoltine H. horticola grows quickly during its final instar, excluding young C. melitaearum simply through limited time and resources. We found that contrary to expectations of the evolution of gregariousness, C. melitaearum, which lives in sibling groups, has biting mandibles in the first instar while the solitary H. horticola has suctorial mouthparts. Previous studies suggest that the two parasitoids co-exist because H. Horticola is dispersive and C. melitaearum is a strong local competitor. However, putting together the results of this experiment and out recent understanding of the adult wasp foraging behaviours and large scale population dynamics, we conclude that H. horticola is both a superior local competitor and more dispersive than C. melitaearum. Cotesia melitaearum has no impact on the population dynamics of H. horticola, persisting as a fugitiv...|$|E
