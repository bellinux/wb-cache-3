5|$|A. f. styani {{has been}} {{described}} by Thomas in 1902 based on one skull from a specimen collected in Sichuan. Pocock distinguished A. f. styani from A. f. fulgens by its longer winter coat and greater blackness of the pelage, bigger skull, <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> curved forehead, and more robust teeth. His description is based on skulls and skins collected in Sichuan, Myitkyina close to the border of Yunnan, and Upper Burma.|$|E

When Han steps on Jabba's tail, Jabba reacts <b>more</b> <b>strongly,</b> winding up as if to punch him. Also, {{in order to make}} Jabba look more convincing, shadows of Han can be seen on his body.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear {{even at a}} minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> than levodopa. They tend to be more expensive than levodopa.|$|E

5|$|It {{is thought}} that the vulcanoids would be very rich in {{elements}} with a high melting point, such as iron and nickel. They are unlikely to possess a regolith because such fragmented material heats and cools more rapidly, and is affected <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> by the Yarkovsky effect, than solid rock. Vulcanoids are probably similar to Mercury in colour and albedo, and may contain material {{left over from the}} earliest stages of the Solar System's formation.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Norm Hiscock and {{directed}} by Paul Feig. The writing staff sought to address more topical issues during the second season, and the same-sex marriage plot {{was inspired by the}} real-life pairing of Harry and Pepper, a pair of romantically involved male penguins at the San Francisco Zoo. However, Hiscock said he was focused <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> on comedy than making a political or social statement.|$|E
5|$|The ionic radii of the {{alkali metals}} are {{much smaller than}} their atomic radii. This is because the {{outermost}} electron of the alkali metals is in a different electron shell than the inner electrons, and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller. Additionally, the effective nuclear charge has increased, and thus the electrons are attracted <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} general schemes in which diffusion may take place. Tracer diffusion and chemical diffusion {{differ in the}} level of adsorbate coverage at the surface, while intrinsic diffusion and mass transfer diffusion differ {{in the nature of the}} diffusion environment. Tracer diffusion and intrinsic diffusion both refer to systems where adparticles experience a relatively homogeneous environment, whereas in chemical and mass transfer diffusion adparticles are <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> affected by their surroundings.|$|E
50|$|Perform paired {{comparisons}} on {{the elements}} within the clusters themselves according to their influence on each element in another cluster they are connected to (outer dependence) or on elements in their own cluster (inner dependence). In making comparisons, you must always have a criterion in mind. Comparisons of elements according to which element influences a third element <b>more</b> and how <b>strongly</b> <b>more</b> than another element it is compared with are made with a control criterion or subcriterion of the control hierarchy in mind.|$|R
50|$|Pre-Soviet Central Asian {{culture and}} {{religion}} promoted female seclusion. Cultural <b>mores</b> <b>strongly</b> condemned unveiling {{as it was}} thought to lead to premarital or adulterous sex, a deep threat to Central Asian conceptions of family honor. Many mullahs also considered the full body veil Islamic, and strongly protested any attempts to alter it. Female seclusion in homes was encouraged {{for the same reasons}} although home seclusion was far more oppressive. Female quarters and male quarters existed separately, and women were not allowed in the presence of male non-relatives. Women from rich families were the most isolated as the family could afford to build numerous rooms and hire servants, removing the need for leaving the home. Traditional settled society encouraged seclusion as a way to protect family honor, as religiously necessary, and as a way of asserting male superiority over women.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} factor was the 'religious' question. The radical liberals (progresistas) after 1820 had grown more and <b>more</b> anticlerical, <b>strongly</b> opposing religious institutes. They were {{suspected of being}} adherents of Freemasonry; {{in the face of}} the governmental financial chaos, Spanish high-ranking governmental officials (Javier de Burgos; Juan Alvarez Mendizabal) negotiated the increased participation of the Rothschild financiers of England and France in a bailout on Spain.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{acquired}} conditions augment {{the risk of}} thrombosis. A prominent example is antiphospholipid syndrome, which is caused by antibodies against constituents of the cell membrane, particularly lupus anticoagulant (first found in people with the disease systemic lupus erythematosus but often detected in people without the disease), anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies; it is therefore regarded as an autoimmune disease. In some cases antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial as well as venous thrombosis. It is also <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> associated with miscarriage, and can cause {{a number of other}} symptoms (such as livedo reticularis of the skin and migraine).|$|E
5|$|After Yugoslavia's leader Josip Broz Tito died in 1980, long-suppressed ethnic {{nationalism}} revived and {{the individual}} republics began to assert their authority <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> {{as the federal government}} weakened. Slovenia and Croatia moved towards multi-party democracy and economic reform, but Serbia's authoritarian communist President Slobodan Milošević opposed reform and sought to increase the power of the communist Yugoslav government. In 1990, Slovenia and Croatia held elections that ended communist rule and brought pro-independence nationalist parties to power in both republics. In Croatia, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party of Franjo Tuđman took office, with Tuđman as President.|$|E
5|$|Alexis Sánchez was one {{of three}} players who made their {{competitive}} debuts for Arsenal in the match; for Manchester City, goalkeeper Willy Caballero was selected ahead of Joe Hart. Arsenal began the game <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> and took the lead when Santi Cazorla scored in the 22nd minute. Their lead was extended two minutes before half time, as Aaron Ramsey finished off a counter-attacking move. Arsenal scored their third of the match soon after the hour mark; Olivier Giroud's shot from outside the penalty box dipped over Caballero and into his goal.|$|E

As an application, we obtain infinitely many solutions for a semilinear Schrödinger equation with strongly indefinite structure and sign-changing nonlinearity. Comment: 17 pages in Adv.

5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} have odd atomic numbers; hence, their {{isotopes}} must be either odd–odd (both proton and neutron number are odd) or odd–even (proton number is odd, but neutron number is even). Odd–odd nuclei have even mass numbers, whereas odd–even nuclei have odd mass numbers. Odd–odd primordial nuclides are rare because most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable {{with respect to}} beta decay, because the decay products are even–even, and are therefore <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> bound, due to nuclear pairing effects.|$|E
5|$|Although the skulls are incompletely preserved, CT {{scanning}} {{suggests that}} each premaxilla held five incisors, with the sockets becoming progressively larger {{from the first}} to the fifth incisor. Like other theriodonts, the crowns of the incisors are conical; they also lack serrations, unlike gorgonopsians and scylacosaurian therocephalians. The interior edge of the incisors seems to be slightly concave, and the back edge {{appears to have a}} ridge. The smaller specimen has a displaced incisor preserved within its nasal cavity; it is <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> recurved and has wear marks on its top edge, suggesting that it is probably a lower incisor. Its fourth incisor also has a replacement tooth growing behind it, accompanied by resorption of the root.|$|E
5|$|As {{is typical}} of an Indo-European language, English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo-European {{languages}} though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favor of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> than any other word class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections. English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as have and do, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement (fronting of question words beginning with wh-) and word order inversion with some verbs.|$|E

5|$|Bigfin reef squids exhibit strong {{positive}} phototactic behaviour (attraction to light) {{and will}} move readily {{within a certain}} distance of a light source. Studies have proposed {{that this might be}} an involuntary stimulus behaviour, as the squids immediately stop all other movements once a light source is switched on. The colour of the light does not matter, but {{it has been shown that}} they react <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> to underwater lights between the intensities of 1.5 to 2.5lx, with peak ranges of 2.5 to 10.0lx.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{interaction}} with nearby stars and galactic tides modified cometary orbits {{to make them}} more circular. This explains the nearly spherical shape of the outer Oort cloud. On the other hand, the Hills cloud, which is bound <b>more</b> <b>strongly</b> to the Sun, has not acquired a spherical shape. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} formation of the Oort cloud is broadly compatible with the hypothesis that the Solar System formed as part of an embedded cluster of 200–400 stars. These early stars likely played a role in the cloud's formation, since the number of close stellar passages within the cluster was much higher than today, leading to far more frequent perturbations.|$|E
