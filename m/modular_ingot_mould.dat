Metallic remains left inside a tundish are known as tundish skulls and need to be removed, typically by mechanical means (scraping, cutting). A casting tundish is lined with refractory bricks specific to the liquid metal which is being cast.|$|R

40|$|While {{manufacturing}} different {{grades of}} steel in an alloy and special steel plant, it is practically impossible to allocate {{the cost of}} major operational materials such as refractories, electrodes and nipples, <b>ingot</b> <b>moulds</b> etc. to each grade of steel.

40|$|International audienceOne of the {{critical}} challenges encountered when modeling a thermo-mechanical problem {{in the context of}} steel casting processes, is to achieve a concurrent and efficient computation of fluid flow (<b>ingot</b> <b>mould</b> filling, nozzle jet in continuous casting) and solid mechanics (stress-strain in solidified regions). This is of crucial importance in industry for the prediction of surface or sub-surface cracks for instance that may initiate in solidified regions during the filling stage of ingot casting, or in the mould region during continuous casting. The current state-of-the-art [15 - 17 - 21] consists in separating the analysis in two distinct stages: fluid flow using CFD codes and stress-strain analysis using structural codes. This induces several drawbacks regarding practical use and computational efficiency. A monolithic formulation, treating the fluid-solid interaction (FSI) may be investigated but is not adapted to the context of solidification, because of huge differences between liquid viscosity and solid consistency. It is then preferable to consider this FSI problem as a weak interaction problem, for which a partitioned formulation is more efficient than a monolithic one. Therefore, a two-step resolution strategy combining fluid flow and solid mechanics has been developed. Liquid flow (natural convection or filling flow), thermal dilatation as well as thermally induced deformation of the solid phase are accounted for...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{capacity}} of alloys (metals) {{is one of}} the crucial thermophysical parameters used for process behaviour prediction in many applications. Heat capacity is an input variable for many thermodynamical (e. g. Thermocalc, Pandat, MTData, …) and kinetic programs (e. g. IDS-Solidification analysis package, …). The dependences of heat capacity on common variables (temperature, pressure, [...] .) are also commonly used as the input data in software packages (e. g. ProCast, Magmasoft, ANSYS Fluent, …) that are applicable in the field of applied research for simulations of technological processes. It follows from the above that the heat capacities of materials, alloys in our case, play a very important role in the field of basic and applied research. Generally speaking, experimental data {{can be found in the}} literature, but corresponding (needed) data for the given alloy can very seldom be found or can differ from the tabulated ones.

Findings: The influence of the filter slenderness on the filtration process efficiency has been determined through variations in quantities and surface shares of the non-metallic inclusions in the filtrated steel {{in relation to the}} non-filtered steel.

40|$|Trial {{excavations}} from 1998 - 2003 {{showed that}} Birnie (near Elgin) {{was the site}} of an important, long-lived later prehistoric settlement complex and subsequently a medieval village. The later prehistoric site was a local power centre in contact with the Roman world far to the south - as seen most spectacularly in two hoards of Roman silver coins, and a range of other Roman finds. Funding has now been secured for a four-year larger-scale excavation, from 2004 - 2007. The aim each year is to tackle a roundhouse, a medieval building, and one or two other areas. In 2004 the probable medieval building in area P was fully excavated. It was a two-phase structure with very insubstantial foundations, a worn sub-rectangular floor hollow, and a central cooking pit later replaced by an external one. To the north lay an iron-working areas, as yet of unknown date. One roundhouse (area M) was of ring-groove construction, 11. 5 m in diameter, with an internal structural post ring. The wall was probably of wattle panels, with a more solid post-built structure flanking the east-facing double door. It had a central cooking pit surrounded by various other features, with a series of radial chambers or small rooms around the edges. The deposits within the building come mostly from its demolition; at this point cattle skulls were placed in it as votive offerings. Notable finds included a clay <b>ingot</b> <b>mould</b> (from the house), a fine Roman brooch and a harness ring of southern Scottish type. Continuing excavation in the area N ring-ditch house clarified its history. The ring ditch contained a series of layers which probably resulted from the trampling of stalled animals and subsequent attempts to repair this. There were few finds. To the south-west an unsuspected large charcoal-rich spread was uncovered, perhaps another house, but time did not allow further investigation.

40|$|Purpose: One of {{the reasons}} behind the {{interest}} in copper titanium alloys was development of new materials to substitute copper beryllium alloys. The reason for selecting that material for studies {{was that in the}} early stages of decomposition of CuTi 4 alloy a spinodal transformation takes place and ordering processes begin. Proper selection of heat treatment and plastic working conditions provides possibilities to produce very wide range of sets of properties by formation of the required alloy microstructure. Therefore the main objective of the study was to capture the changes in precipitation kinetics, especially in the relations between supersaturation and ageing or between supersaturaion, cold deformation and ageing in connection to the changes in microstructure and functional properties (mainly changes in hardness and electrical conductivity). Design/methodology/approach: Melting of the charge material was conducted in medium-frequency induction furnace, in a graphite crucible. The melted material after bath preparation was poured into a cast iron <b>ingot</b> <b>mould</b> (with graphite grease applied on the inside) of dimensions 35 x 120 x 250 mm. The ingots after casting were peeled. The treated ingots were heated in resistance furnace at 900 ºC for 1. 5 hour and rolled down on a reversible two-high mill. Findings: Decomposition of supersaturated solid solution in that alloy is similar to the alloys produced in laboratory scale. The observed differences in microstructure after supersaturation were related to the presence of undissolved Ti particles and increased segregation of titanium distribution in copper matrix including microareas of individual grains. The mentioned factors influence the mechanism and kinetics of precipitation and subsequently the produced wide ranges of functional properties of the alloy. Research limitations/implications: Cold deformation (50 % reduction) of the alloy after supersaturation changes the mechanism and kinetics of precipitation and provides possibilities for production of broader sets of functional properties. It is expected that widening of the cold deformation range should result in more complete characteristics of material properties, suitable for the foreseen applications. Similar effects can be expected after application of cold deformation after ageing. Practical implications: The elaborated research results present some utilitarian qualities since they can be used in development of process conditions for industrial scale production of strips from CuTi 4 alloy of defined properties and operating qualities.

40|$|This {{research}} {{developed at}} University of Liege aims {{to optimize the}} complete semi-continuous casting process at LBP Company, a producer of copper-nickel alloys (or cupro-nickels). The process consists in vertical casting of 7 m long ingots. Some problems recurrently occur during casting process: formation of oscillations (wave length of about 500 mm), unsuitable concave cross-sections or internal cracks. In {{order to reduce the}} occurrence of such defects and to better understand their formation, we have been asked to develop a finite element model.

A detailed microstructural characterisation and study of creep properties have been accomplished. The alloy in both ingot-casting (IC) and high pressure die-casting (HPDC) conditions consists of á-Mg, C 36 ((Mg,Al) 2 Ca) and Al-Mn rich phases. Microstructural study revealed finer grain size, closely spaced network and increased volume fraction of secondary eutectic phases for HPDC specimen when {{compared to that of}} the IC specimen. The grain size variation and denser network of eutectic phases was due to the considerable difference in cooling rate, high degree of undercooling associated with the faster cooling rate following HPDC facilitates the formation {{of a large number of}} nuclei in the liquid Mg alloy. The eutectic C 36 phases were also observed to be coarser in the case of IC specimen owing to the slower solidification rate. Porosity was discovered significant in the HPDC specimen in comparison to the negligible extent in IC specimen. Following creep tests at 70 MPa stress level and temperature of 175 °C and 200 °C the HPDC specimens exhibited superior creep resistance as compared to the IC specimens. The significant creep resistance exhibited by the HPDC specimen was primarily due to the dispersion strengthening effect offered by hindering of dislocation movement at the grain boundaries. Stress dependence on the strain rates for the alloys cast by both the technologies were studied and deduced that the dominant creep mechanism was dislocation creep. The same was theortically confirmed from the deformation mechanism map established for Mg alloys. Post creep microstructural studies revealed increased precipitation of C 36 phase at the grain boundaries.

40|$|This volume {{provides}} an illustrated {{catalogue of the}} metalwork (weapons, personal ornaments and tools) and metalworking evidence from the later Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Periods from the key site of Tell el-Dab’a XV a in the eastern Nile Delta. Through extensive discussion of both parallels and contrasts, the main groups of material are set {{in the context of}} the metalwork styles characteristic of both Egypt and the east Mediterranean during the first half of the second millennium BC. Discussion of the form and technology of the metallurgical remains - <b>moulds,</b> <b>ingots,</b> crucibles, tuyeres and industrial waste - illuminates the nature of metal processing on the site, and provides evidence of the relationship between types of mould and specific products. Data on the chemical composition of a range of silver and copper-alloy artefacts demonstrates that the relationship between form and alloy is complex, and is not solely determined by mechanical concerns. The evidence highlights various characteristics of the metal industry in the Nile Delta, which render it distinctive from those of both the Levant and the Nile Valley. Stylistic analysis highlights the extent to which metalwork characteristic of the Delta drew its ultimate inspiration from forms documented in north-west Syria during the EB IV period. This is not to argue that common styles indicate common meanings. Rather, a combined consideration of style, technology and context facilitates discussion of the role of metal artefacts in symbolic communication. Thus metalwork is seen in terms of its place within specific local cultural practices. Given the strong connections of the acquisition of raw materials and the production and consumption of metalwork to the political economy, both stylistic developments and differential access to specific classes of artefact are seen as being implicated in the creation of social difference, through systems of elite representation, and thus to symbolic dimensions of power. It is argued that the evidence from Tell el-Dab’a XV represents merely one element in a wider process which entailed the appropriation and recontextualisation in various parts of the east Mediterranean during the late third and earlier second millennia BC, of styles of elite representation originating in third millennium Syria. In the Delta, metal artefacts gained a particular significance through their linkage to specific ways representing elite male status. The reproduction over a number of generations of this distinctive local system of meaning contributed to the marked emphasis upon the deposition of elements such as warrior equipment and equids in mortuary contexts. The close similarity between metalwork produced in the Delta and that occurring in the southern Levant, if understood as connected with common modes of expressing high status, may be a material indicator of regional political networks. ...|$|R
40|$|Novelis Global Technology Centre (NGTC) in Kingston, Ontario {{have been}} {{developing}} {{a relatively new}} technology known as Novelis Fusion™ Technology, which is a new variant of the traditional direct chill (DC) casting process that allows co-casting of multi-layered composite aluminum alloy ingots. One of the first steps in this development program {{is to create a}} mathematical model of conventional DC casting and validate it through experimentation before proceeding to the next step of modeling, designing, testing, and experimenting with the co casting process. The focus of this document is on the design of the experiments, measurement technique, and analysis of the experimental results to be used to validate the models for conventional DC casting. A series of experiments was conducted using a lab scale caster using a 95 mm × 227 mm rectangular mould available at the Novelis Global Technology Centre in Kingston, Ontario. AA 3003, AA 6111, and AA 4045 aluminum alloys were chosen for this study since these aluminum alloys are commonly used in clad products. Two series of experiments were performed to investigate the effect of casting parameters on the solidification and cooling of the ingots such as casting speed, water flow rate, and the superheat of the molten aluminum. A set of seven thermocouples were embedded in the ingot during the cast to capture the thermal history of the ingot. Melt poisoning with a zinc rich alloy was also performed as an independent method of determining the sump depth and shape. Experienced gained from the first series of experiments allowed improvements to be made to the experiment design for the second series of experiments. Thermocouples must be supported so they are not pushed out of position by the jet of molten aluminum entering the mould. Grounded thermocouples of at least 1. 5 mm in diameter were recommended to survive the high temperatures of the molten aluminum. Knowledge gained from the experiments of the conventional DC caster allowed design and development of an experimental co-caster mould that will be useful for future research at NGTC. Melt poisoning and thermocouples were complementary measurement methods that should be used together. In all three alloys, the liquidus sump profile generated by the thermocouple implants correlated well with the etched sumps of the melt poisoned ingots. Primary and secondary water flow rates beyond 1. 79 L/s and increasing the superheat by 30 °C did not have significant effect of the cooling rate with solidified ingots, but all casting experiments showed that the thermal histories and sump profiles were very sensitive to the casting speed. The sump depth increased with increasing casting speed in all casting experiments. The sump depth increased directly proportionally to the Péclet number and the sump depth could be predicted using a linear regression model by calculating the Péclet number. The formation of remelting bands were seen in the surface of the AA 3003 and AA 4045 ingots, but were not apparent in the AA 6111 ingots. A fast Fourier transform performed on the data obtained from the thermocouples that were inserted in the mould wall showed that remelting occurred at regular intervals and that the frequency increased with casting speed. The thermocouples in the mould also indicated that AA 6111 had a higher rate of heat transfer than AA 3003 or AA 4045. The AA 6111 ingots had a higher rate of heat transfer in the mould than for the other alloys. This was evidence that there was a smaller air gap formation between the <b>ingot</b> and the <b>mould</b> in AA 6111. This research on the effects of casting parameters on DC cast ingots made using the three alloys, AA 3003, AA 6111, and AA 4045, is beneficial {{in the development of a}} design of an experimental lab-scale co-caster for validation of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the Fusion™ Technology process...|$|R

The cultural facies concerned is a Chalcolithic facies anchored in Bas- Quercy, apparently attached to the verazian sphere and the Languedocian chronology (cf. Chaps. 4. 2 and 8. 4). The site of "La Salaberdié" is much more limited, but complementary. Indeed, it relates to an occupation that is clearly a little more recent, included in a bracket ranging from - 2550 to - 2350 BCE. It is possible that there was some overlap, but the series exhibit small differences that evoke a slight diachronism. Although the pottery assemblages show a very strong affinity with each other, the presence of a Bell Beaker-type appropriation of style at "La Salaberdié" could reflect the emergence of this influence in the zone. As regards lithic industries (cf. Chaps. 5 and 9), exogenic materials such as flint, already very poorly represented at "La vayssonnié", are completely absent in the small series of "La Salaberdié". This small time shift between the two sites is rather an advantage, since it concerns two relatively close but quite distinct geographical areas. This is because it provides a reference chronology covering almost all the Chalcolithic, derived from closed assemblages (sixty of them yielding pottery). Such a reference frame was previously lacking between the garonne plain, Southern Rouergue, Larzac and the Montagne Noire (cf. Chap. 1). generally, the various types of artefacts evoke a local production, but are also attached to the Languedocian sphere, which seems relevant in this early metallurgy context. Nature of the occupationsThe chrono-cultural coherence of each site allows us to outline the spatial arrangement of the structures, since these latter also make up a reference frame (cf. Chap. 3). For the "La Vayssonnié" site alone, this reference frame comprises 127 anomalies distributed over an area of 5000 m 2, and can bebroken down into 72 proven structures including: three "kilns", nine "small pits", 13 "bowl-shaped hearths ", 21 "oblique pits " and 29 "medium and large pits". Each occupation appears to cover a rather limited time span, since only one direct section is observed. Evidently, the depth of erosion, cutting down locally to more than 0. 5 m, prevents us from observing surface works and shallow-buried structures, which leads to an important bias. However, certain activity levels appear to show through, {{as in the case of}} associations "gA and gB" (cf. Chap. 3, 1. 2). Almost all the remains of activities (carbonized seeds, abundant grinding tools, wasters on large pots) evoke the conservation and preparation of cereals. Unfortunately, it is difficult to identify the combustion structures from which these remains are derived, because of various problems that are often mentioned (erosion, pedogenesis, etc., cf. Chap. 2). However, structures A “La vayssonnié” et “La Salaberdié” 40 and A 91 (association "gB") are of a very particular type. They are strongly reminiscent of the "possible pottery-firing structure" of Nôtre Dame-de-Marceille at Limoux in the department of Aude (vaquer 1994). Attributed to the Saint-Pons or vérazian group, this latter structure exhibits a longitudinal "stepped" profile, similar to that of anomaly A 91. Its fill is also primarily composed of combustion residues thrown down in various beds. Although abundant ceramic remains are recorded at Nôtre Dame-de-Marceille, no mention is made of overfired and/or deformed elements. Pits A 40 and A 91 also evoke three combustion structures of the Early/Middle Bronze Age on Tatihou island (Manche department: Marcigny, dir. Ghesquière 2003, p. 57 to 62), which are termed "suspended kilns". However, apart from their morphology, we do not find any convincing elements of architecture (fragments of hearth floor or pillar, etc.) in our two pits. Moreover, the abundant oxidized sand component in the surrounding sediments at this site makes it impossible to observe the presence of any eventual reddening. Nevertheless, we still consider that one of these structures could have been used to produce the waster pots and/or carbonized seeds, perhaps in the context of a mixed operation, implying a possible "tiered/layered kiln". Lastly, we could also explain these structures by the burning down of a building especially reserved for agricultural activities, leaving remains composed of (varied) lithic elements trapped in storage pits with platforms (9; 40; 91). Although the structures and refuse deposits present over the remainder of the site are less evocative of pottery craft activity, they remain as a "background", which is normal for the periodconsidered. Taking into consideration the taphonomic bias, it is not possible to say whether the entire zone was dedicated to agricultural and craft activities. A possible argument in favour is the slope of the substrate, the exposure towards the North (perhaps motivated by the presence of water farther downslope), the absence of faunal remains and the striking over-representation of macro-tools. Nevertheless, the distribution of pottery volumes seems in conformity with that already observed on sub-contemporary "habitats", and it is rather unlikely that the storage structures and treatment areas were located very far away from the habitat. Consequently, we adopt the hypothesis that the area was used for generalpurposeactivities, while nevertheless containing some zones related to preferential activities (gA, gB, gF, etc.) within or near the habitat. Concerning the site of "La Salaberdié", the small number of structures (12 anomalies, including 5 proven structures, over an area of 1200 m 2 (cf. Chap. 7) makes it even more complicated to define the nature of the occupation. This site also displays features usually restricted to small domestic and generalpurpose occupations, which further highlights the importance of the probable smelting furnace at A 10. Local metallurgy of copperIn fact, the structures used for copper smelting in the South of France are so far only known from specialized sites. They generally comprise furnaces of small volume, with simple and rather shallow bowl-shaped hearths (Ambert et al. 2005; Barge 2003, p. 54 to 60; Rovira 2005 a, p. 184; 2005 b) that are more suitable for obtaining a high temperature. However, these structures have little chance of being preserved on an eroded surface such as observed at "La vayssonnié". We were able to collect some slag and shards that had been strongly altered by high temperatures, but found nothing indicative of a "reduction" process. This is found, for example, at the nearby site of "Al Claus" (Carozza 1998; Carozza et al. 1997; Carozza, Burens, Laurens 1998), whose occupation is situated in the same age bracket as "La Salaberdié", and where a score of copper-rich metal encrustations were observed on the inner walls of the shards. The authors proposed to interpret these encrustations as the residue of a reduction technique carried out directly in pots derived from the common vessel assemblage and reused as "smelting pots or crucibles", which corresponds to a technique initially documented in Spain [vasos-hornos in Spanish] (Ambert et al. 1996; Ambert, Rovira 2003, p. 285 to 287; Rovira 2005 a; Rovira, Ambert 2002). At "La Salaberdié", the carpet of shards covering the bottom of small furnace A 10 (cf. Chaps. 7 and 11) has also yielded a large number (about sixty) of scoriaceous lumps. This material also accumulated on the inner walls (i. e. concave faces) of the shards, which show an extremely high porosity indicating the attainment of high temperatures. But the shards correspond to very small fragments (412) derived from several pots (more than four), and are distributed with equal density over the bottom. Thus, the structure is not a "smelting-pot furnace" [vasos-hornos in Spanish], but rather a composite hearth. In this same structure, we find the "nozzle" or "tuyere" of a bellows, as well as an <b>ingot</b> <b>mould</b> that most probably corresponds to the mould of a flat axe similar in size to the specimen from "La vayssonnié" (cf. Chaps. 6. 2 and 11). These finds characterize the furnace as having an authentic new character. The presence of these objects, the small size of the pit and the signs of heating undoubtedly equal to or higher than 1000 °C, are all indications in favour of a smelting furnace with a hearth that represents a novel development. It probably relates to the final stages in the operational chain, including casting and moulding, since there are no proven traces of copper waste (some analyses of the slaggy residues are envisaged). As mentioned above, the framework of discovery provides a good demonstration that the final stages of the operational chain of copper metallurgy (smelting, moulding and hammering) can be carried out in a domestic context, as has already been proposed (Carozza 2005, p. 660; Maass 2005, 8; Rovira 2005 b, p. 180), even though the present example clearly involves a very specialized craft industry. Moreover, the site of "La vayssonnié" has also yielded some secondary markers of this activity, that is to say, three probable fragments of "ingot moulds" and a fine specimen of a "galet à cupules" ["pitted pebble/cupstone"] (cf. Chap. 11). But the importance of opper in|$|R
