5|$|On November 15, 2008, a 34-kg probe made a {{hard landing}} near the crater. The moon impact probe (MIP) was {{launched}} from the Indian Chandrayaan-I spacecraft {{and reached the}} surface 25 <b>minutes</b> <b>later.</b> <b>The</b> probe carried a radar altimeter, video imaging system, and a mass spectrometer, which {{will be used to}} search for water.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 10:50, 107mm rocket fire began impacting in {{the vicinity}} of LZ Hotel. Less than 10 <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> LZ also received 82mm mortar fire. As soon as the Khmer Rouge fire commenced, the controllers in the zone notified the Air Force forward air controllers (FACs) flying overhead in 23d Tactical Air Support Squadron OV-10s. The FACs immediately made low passes over the east bank of the Mekong, but could not spot any fire coming from known enemy positions in that location. At 10:59, the last element of 2nd Battalion 4th Marines left the zone and the last marine helicopter landed on the USS Okinawa at 12:15.|$|E
5|$|Five <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> Allied ships spotted {{clouds of}} smoke {{on the horizon}} and Acton ordered the Italian ships to attack shortly {{afterwards}} while the two British cruisers turned {{to cut off the}} two Austrian destroyers. Aquila opened fire at 08:15 at long range, but inflicted no damage before she was immobilised by a hit at 08:32 that detonated inside her central boiler room and severed her main steam pipe. The Austrian ships managed to disengage before the cruisers could close the distance.|$|E
60|$|A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> bow-gun was fired. It was {{too near}} for the shot to spread properly, but it cut a lane through the crowd, {{and half a}} <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> second gun crashed out. By this time the sailors had all loaded their muskets again.|$|R
60|$|A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> {{standing}} figure {{began to}} wave his arms wildly.|$|R
60|$|A <b>minute</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> grim {{doctor and}} {{ourselves}} {{were in the}} sitting-room below.|$|R
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel F. O. Chilton's 2/2nd Infantry Battalion {{found that}} it was best to keep skirmishing forward {{throughout}} this advance, because going to ground {{for any length of time}} meant sitting in the middle of the enemy artillery concentrations that inflicted further casualties. The Australian troops made good progress, six tank crossings were readied and mines between them and the wire had been detected. Five <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> 23 Matildas of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment advanced, accompanied by the 2/2nd Infantry Battalion. Passing through the gaps, they swung right along the double line of posts.|$|E
5|$|Major General Ennis Whitehead's Advanced Echelon (ADVON) {{headquarters}} in Port Moresby ordered three squadrons based there {{to join the}} battle. P-38s of the 39th Fighter Squadron engaged a dozen Japanese fighters over Wau, shooting one down. A few <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> 9th Fighter Squadron—which had only recently converted to the P-38—downed another Japanese fighter, while P-40s of the 41st Fighter Squadron surprised six Japanese fighters, shooting down three. The airmen claimed to have shot down 23 Japanese fighters and a bomber. Australian gunners of the 156th Light Anti Aircraft Battery claimed another bomber and two fighters. For its part in the battle, the 374th Troop Carrier Group was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation.|$|E
5|$|None of them played instruments, so I {{was left}} to do the music and get that vibe together. What I said to them was, 'Look, I've got a chorus—check this out'. And I'd sing them the chorus and the melody—no lyrics or anything—and {{straight}} away five pencils and pads came out and they were throwing lines at us. Ten <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much {{it was a real}} quick process. They were confident in what they were doing, throwing it out there.|$|E
60|$|A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> {{door opened}} and a party of a dozen {{soldiers}} entered.|$|R
60|$|The waiter rang a bell, and a <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> outdoor porter {{presented}} himself.|$|R
60|$|A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> groom returned, {{followed}} by the runner who had brought the letter.|$|R
5|$|Thirty <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> {{remainder}} of the transports carrying the division began to take off. This wave was divided into three groups. The first consisted of 239 Douglas Dakota and Short Stirling transports as well as seventeen Horsa gliders, carrying {{the bulk of the}} 3rd and 5th Parachute Brigades and their heavy equipment. These forces were due to land in their respective drop-zones at 00:50. The second group was destined to land at 03:20, and consisted of sixty-five Horsa and four Hamilcar gliders transporting the divisional headquarters and an anti-tank battery. The final group was formed of three Horsa gliders carrying sappers and men from the 9th Parachute Battalion, who were to land atop Merville Battery at 04:30.|$|E
5|$|Twenty <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> 16 Zuikaku torpedo planes {{arrived and}} split up to attack Enterprise. One group of torpedo bombers was {{attacked}} by two CAP Wildcats which shot down three of them and damaged a fourth. On fire, the fourth damaged aircraft purposely crashed into the destroyer , setting the ship on fire and killing 57 of her crew. The torpedo carried by this aircraft detonated shortly after impact, causing more damage. The fires initially seemed out of control until Smiths commanding officer ordered the destroyer to steer into the large spraying wake of the battleship , which helped put out the fires. Smith then resumed her station, firing her remaining anti-aircraft guns at the torpedo planes.|$|E
5|$|Watched by a near-capacity crowd, the {{visitors}} Arsenal began the tie more strongly, {{but failed to}} convert their chances. They took the lead minutes before half-time when Alan Smith scored from a Paul Merson cross. Wrexham's performance improved the longer the match went, and they equalised through Mickey Thomas's free kick in the 82nd minute. Two <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> home side went ahead after Steve Watkin collected the ball from his teammate Gordon Davies and diverted it past goalkeeper David Seaman. A pitch invasion occurred once the whistle blew for full-time; the Wrexham players and staff joined in celebrations with their supporters. Wrexham's reward was a fourth-round tie against West Ham United which they lost in a replay.|$|E
60|$|Rinaldo at once sent a man up, and a <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> light {{suddenly}} disappeared.|$|R
50|$|Close to one <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> first {{fire engine}} {{tried to contact}} the tower, but got no response.|$|R
60|$|The man {{handed over}} ten rouble notes, and they passed out. A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> {{policeman}} strolled in.|$|R
5|$|Allen's men marched southward {{from the}} base, with the {{intention}} of entering the enemy base camp from a slightly different direction to the west. Preceded by marching artillery fire, the 2nd Battalion stopped periodically to conduct cloverleaf patrols to their front, rear and both flanks. At 9:56am the lead element of Alpha Company stumbled upon a northeast-southwest trail, which appeared to have been used within the last hour. The 1st Platoon Leader then requested and received permission to make cloverleaf patrols to the east and west of the trail. Almost immediately, the 1st Platoon sighted a Viet Cong soldier while scouting west of the trail and another group of Viet Cong soldiers soon appeared. George then ordered the 1st Platoon to set up a hasty ambush across the trail, but {{by the time they were}} in position the Viet Cong soldiers had disappeared and everything was quiet. About 10–15 <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> 1st Platoon Leader reported that trees were moving, in addition to the sound of weapons clicking and the rattle of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} weather {{within a}} persistent, broad trough across the southwestern Caribbean organized into the nineteenth tropical {{depression of the}} season by 06:00UTC on October20 about 195mi (315km) north of Cabo Gracias a Dios. The depression was slow to organize at first, affected by dry air and moderate shear from a trough over the Southeast United States and western Atlantic, but eventually strengthened into Tropical Storm Richard by 12:00UTC on October21 as it curved south and then west. Upper-level winds slackened over subsequent days, allowing the cyclone to attain hurricane intensity early on October24 and reach peak winds of 100mph (160km/h) by 00:00UTC the next day. Richard moved ashore near Gales Point, Belize, thirty <b>minutes</b> <b>later.</b> <b>The</b> system weakened rapidly once inland, degenerating into a remnant low by 00:00UTC on October26. Despite emerging over the Bay of Campeche, high wind shear prevented redevelopment and instead caused the feature to dissipate eighteen hours later.|$|E
5|$|At 07:50, Cota led {{the charge}} off of Dog Green, between WN-68 and WN-70, by forcing gaps in the wire with a Bangalore torpedo and wire cutters. Twenty <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> 5th Rangers joined the advance, and blew more openings. The command party {{established}} themselves {{at the top of}} the bluff, and elements of G/116 and H/116 joined them, having earlier moved laterally along the beach, and now the narrow front had widened to the east. Before 09:00, small parties from F/116 and B/116 reached the crests just east of Dog White. The right flank of this penetration was covered by the survivors of the 2nd Rangers’ A and B companies, who had independently fought their way to the top between 08:00 and 08:30. They took WN-70 (already heavily damaged by naval shells), and joined the 5th Rangers for the move inland. By 09:00 more than 600 American troops, in groups ranging from company sized to just a few men, had reached the top of the bluff opposite Dog White and were advancing inland.|$|E
60|$|A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> {{men were}} disarmed. There {{was still a}} desperate {{struggle}} {{going on on the}} ground.|$|R
60|$|A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> {{merchant}} himself, {{a handsome}} man of {{about the same age}} as Jean Martin, came down.|$|R
60|$|A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> young count himself ran {{downstairs and}} warmly embraced Guy, to the astonishment of the valet.|$|R
5|$|At around 11:00pm on 6 February 1965, about 300 Viet Cong {{soldiers}} of the 30th Company assembled at their positions outside Camp Holloway, where they began breaking through the wire fences. However, the Viet Cong's mission nearly turned into a disaster when their combat engineers accidentally tripped an electrical wire after breaking through the third fence barrier, but the U.S. Military Police patrolling the area did not detect it. At 1:50am on 7 February 1965, the Viet Cong attackers opened fire with their AK-47 rifles, having successfully penetrated Camp Holloway. Shortly afterwards, the Viet Cong mortared the airfield and the U.S. advisory compound, while the sections of the 30th Company attacked their respective targets with small arms fire. About five <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> Viet Cong began retreating from the facility. Later that morning the Viet Cong claimed victory, having caused the death of eight U.S. soldiers, and another 126 wounded. In addition, ten aircraft were destroyed and 15 more were damaged.|$|E
5|$|Fifty <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> lead {{elements}} of the 2/48th Battalion entered the main mission complex, which {{was found to be}} quite badly damaged. Finally, at 10:00am, upon the insistence of the 2/48th Battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Ainslie, Derrick was given the honour of raising the Australian flag over the mission, signifying that the battle had come to an end. Shortly after this, the tanks finally reached the 2/24th Battalion, and the 2,200 feature was also captured. Upon completion of the flag-raising ceremony, a company from the 2/48th moved on to the 3,200 feature, which had also been abandoned, while further to the west, the 2/23rd, along with the 2/4th Commando Squadron cleared Mararuo and in the process found evidence that the Japanese had withdrawn towards Wareo.|$|E
5|$|Goebel {{played a}} role in a famous Ohio State-Illinois game on November 13, 1943. The game was Paul Brown's last game as coach of the Buckeyes. With the score tied 26–26, Ohio State threw an {{incomplete}} forward pass into the end zone as the gun sounded. The game appeared to have ended in a tie, the teams left the field, and the stands emptied. However, Ohio State assistant coach Ernie Godfrey had noticed Goebel, who was the head linesman, drop a handkerchief to signal a penalty. On hearing the gun sound, Goebel had picked up the handkerchief and put it back in his back pocket. Godfrey confronted Goebel, who conceded that Illinois was offsides. Twenty <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> teams came back onto the field and the Buckeyes kicked a 33-yard field goal to give Coach Brown a 29–26 win in his final game.|$|E
60|$|A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> lackey {{returned}} with a bundle containing the suit of clothes. Ned placed it in his basket.|$|R
60|$|However, just as {{he turned}} to go a call was heard in front, and a <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> man came in.|$|R
60|$|A <b>minute</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> head of {{the column}} crossed the {{temporary}} bridge. Francois had run down and received them in the gateway.|$|R
5|$|Moltke and {{the other}} battlecruisers {{followed}} the move, which put them astern of König. Hipper's badly battered ships gained a temporary moment of respite, and uncertainty over the exact location and course of Scheer's ships led Admiral Jellicoe to turn his ships eastward, towards {{what he thought was}} the likely path of the German retreat. The German fleet was instead sailing west, but Scheer ordered a second 16-point turn, which reversed course and pointed his ships {{at the center of the}} British fleet. The German fleet came under intense fire from the British line, and Scheer sent Moltke, Von der Tann, Seydlitz, and Derfflinger at high speed towards the British fleet, in an attempt to disrupt their formation and gain time for his main force to retreat. By 20:17, the German battlecruisers had closed to within 7,700yards (7,040m) of , at which point Scheer directed the ships to engage the lead ship of the British line. However, three <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> German battlecruisers turned in retreat, covered by a torpedo boat attack.|$|E
5|$|Needing a draw at minimum, United {{were in a}} keen {{position}} to win their second-consecutive Challenge Cup. The club closed out their cup run with their third and final match against last-place Toronto FC; who had fallen to both Chicago and Charleston earlier in the week. The match started out heavily in favor of United, who scored off a Charlie Davies goal in the ninth minute. The 1–0 lead over the Reds was short-lived, as TFC quickly leveled off of a penalty kick scored by TFC captain, Dwayne De Rosario, leveling the match at one-all. Immediately <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> Reds struck again, taking a 2–1 lead. The lead was Toronto's first in the entire tournament and, ironically, United's first time trailing in a match in the entire tournament.|$|E
5|$|On 27 March, the {{division}} sortied {{with the rest}} of the fleet for a major sweep toward the island of Crete. During the operation, Trieste flew the flag of Rear Admiral Luigi Sansonetti. At 06:55 on the 28th, an IMAM Ro.43 floatplane launched by Vittorio Veneto located a British cruiser squadron, and by 07:55, Trento and the 3rd Division had come within visual range. Seventeen <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> Italian cruisers opened fire from a range of , initiating the first phase of the Battle of Cape Matapan; in the span of the next forty minutes, Trieste fired a total of 132armor-piercing shells, though trouble with her rangefinders and the extreme range of the action prevented her from scoring any significant hits.|$|E
60|$|A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> big car {{started on}} the way to Oak Hall, with Dave at the wheel and his uncle beside him.|$|R
60|$|A <b>minute</b> <b>later,</b> <b>the</b> Third Bombay Cavalry dashed {{up to the}} fort. The {{door was}} thrown open, and the little {{garrison}} ran out.|$|R
60|$|But {{the train}} was already moving. I tried to catch her, but failed; and a <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>the</b> cars rolled out of sight.|$|R
