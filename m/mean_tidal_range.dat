The analysis of sequential vertical aerial photographs was combined with field work in order to highlight the effects of swash bar development on the adjacent shoreline in the vicinity of a megatidal inlet (<b>mean</b> spring <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> of 11 m). Swash bars are observed to form on the ebb tidal delta and to migrate landward before welding onto the coast. A close relationship was noticed between the position of the swash bar and shoreline dynamics. The bar protects the shore against wave attack in a sedimentary system controlled by longshore transport. This protective role is, however, modulated by the large <b>tidal</b> <b>range.</b> As the bar migrates upward toward the high‐tide level and the subaerial beach, it develops morphologically into a transverse form that acts as a cross‐shore obstacle to longshore sediment transport, thus resulting in shoreline accretion updrift and in strong erosion downdrift. This disturbance may persist for years because of the relatively slow speed of movement of the bar at this stage, an aspect characteristic of large tide range environments. This pattern of behavior differs fundamentally from that documented in the literature where the perturbation of the longshore sediment transport occurs over shorter periods. An original conceptual model of swash bar morphodynamics and repercussions on the adjacent shoreline for this megatidal environment is proposed...|$|R

A vertically integrated bi-dimensional hydrodynamic numerical model (SIMSYS 2 D) was implemented. The model was calibrated qualitatively by directly comparing simulated and observed sea surface elevation for several stations and time series. A quantitative assessment was completed, using RMAE, RM S and Skill methods for the longer time series and RMS and Skill for the shorter ones. A RMAE of 0. 01 2 m and a RMS varying between 0. 053 m and 0. 147 m were obtained. The RMS value of 0. 147 m corresponds to about 4 % of the maximum <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> for the considered time series and 6 % of the <b>mean</b> local <b>tidal</b> <b>range.</b> The calculated values of Skill were within 0. 992 and 0. 998 range.

The estuary cuts across a major sand dune barrier and has been sourced by sand derived from offshore and alongshore, {{as well as from}} recycling of the aeolian dunes lining its north bank. Sand released by the severe erosion of these north bank dunes is temporarily stored on the beaches. A small fraction of the sand is back-cycled into the dunes via blowouts. The rest is transported towards the inner estuary where it forms longitudinal aeolian dune ridges and sand sheets that are ultimately recycled into sandy-muddy intertidal flats that develop into salt marshes. The erosion of the dunes lining the north bank of the estuary represents a morphodynamic adjustment to concentration f the tidal flux against his north bank by massive accretion and progradation of a south-bank sand platform. This erosion contributes in g ving a funnel-shaped stuary mouth and probably in accommodating the tidal prism following large-scale reclamation of the inner estuary.

The Ord River estuary is now geomorphologically unstable. Can this also occur in the Mekong delta? The estuary is shallow with a <b>mean</b> maximum <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> of 3. 2 m.

50|$|The typical <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> in {{the open}} ocean is about 0.6 metres (2 feet). Closer to the coast, this range is much greater. Coastal <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> vary {{globally}} and can differ anywhere from near zero to over 11 metres (38 feet). The exact range depends on the volume of water adjacent to the coast, and the geography of the basin the water sits in. Larger bodies of water have higher ranges, and the geography {{can act as a}} funnel amplifying or dispersing the tide. The world's largest <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> of 16.3 metres (53.5 feet) occurs in Bay of Fundy, Canada, and the United Kingdom regularly experiences <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> up to 15 metres between England and Wales in the Severn Estuary. The top 50 locations with the largest <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> worldwide are listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United States.|$|R
50|$|Tides often {{determine}} the range over which sediment is deposited or eroded. Areas with high <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> allow waves to reach {{farther up the}} shore, and areas with lower <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> produce deposition at a smaller elevation interval. The <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> {{is influenced by the}} size and shape of the coastline. Tides do not typically cause erosion by themselves; however, tidal bores can erode as the waves surge up river estuaries from the ocean.|$|R
