40|$|Twenty-five Neogene-Quaternary whales hosted in Italian museum {{collections}} and their associated fauna were analysed {{for evidence of}} whale-fall community development in shallow-water settings. The degree of bone articulation, completeness of the skeleton and lithology of the embedding sediments were used to gather information on relative water depth, water energy, sedimentation rate and overall environmental predictability around the bones. Shark teeth and hard-shelled invertebrates with a necrophagous diet in close association with the bones were used as evidence of scavenging. Fossil bone bioerosion, microbially mediated cementation and other mollusc shells in {{the proximity of the}} remains informed on past biological activity around the bones. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that shallow-water whale falls differ from their deep-water counterparts. Taphonomic pathways are more variable on the shelf and whale carcasses may not go through all steps of the ecological succession as recognised in the deep sea. Whilst the <b>mobile</b> <b>scavenger</b> and the enrichment opportunistic stages are well represented, chemosynthetic taxa typical of the sulphophilic stage were recovered only in one instance. The presence of a generalist fauna among the suspension feeding bivalves and carnivorous gastropods, and the extreme rarity of chemosynthetic taxa, suggest that predatory pressure rules out whale-fall specialists from shallow shelf settings as in analogous cold seep and vent shallow-water communities.

50|$|The {{other type}} II {{cells in the}} {{alveolar}} wall are granular cells, which secrete surfactant, a film of fatty substances {{that contributes to the}} lowering of alveolar surface tension. Without this coating, the alveoli would collapse and very large forces would be required to re-expand them. Another type of cell, known as an alveolar macrophage, resides on the internal surfaces of the air cavities of the alveoli, the alveolar ducts, and the bronchioles. They are <b>mobile</b> <b>scavengers</b> that serve to engulf foreign particles in the lungs, such as dust, bacteria, carbon particles, and blood cells from injuries.|$|R
40|$|Abstract There are severe {{problems}} both {{in predicting}} and in detecting {{the responses of}} benthic communities to manganese nodule mining. Predictions are hampered by the basic lack of natural history information for deep-sea organisms; in {{all but a few}} instances, crucial data on dietary habits, population dynamics, modes and rates of dispersal, food-web relationships, and natural successional sequences and rates are lacking. Detection is further impeded by sampling problems. Besides the obvious logistic problems encountered in sam-pling under miles of water, the extremely low areal densities at which most deep-sea species live enforce wide confidence limits about their estimated mean abundances. The rarest species in any deep-sea com-munity have yet to be sampled. Nonetheless, some predictions can be made. Animals {{in the path of the}} nodule collector will suffer high mortalities. Populations depend-ent upon manganese nodules as attachment substrata will be very slow to recover (> 103 yr), as will food-web members dependent on this encrusting epifauna. <b>Mobile</b> <b>scavengers</b> (i. e., fishes, amphipods...|$|R
40|$|When whales die {{and sink}} to the sea-floor, they provide a sudden, {{enormous}} food supply to organisms in the vicinity. At first, larger <b>mobile</b> <b>scavengers</b> remove the flesh, but also when only the bones remain, the whale-fall can still sustain macrofauna communities for several years. Some organisms have adapted so well {{to this kind of}} food source that they would have problems living elsewhere, e. g. species within the polychaete genus Osedax which have developed a root system which can bore into the bones to reach nutrients. Other organisms are not so specialized on the bones, but rather on the sulphur-oxidizing filamentous bacterial mats covering the bones. Polychaetes from several families have been observed grazing the bacterial mats, and some of the species reported from whale-falls have also been found in other ephemeral, chemosynthetic habitats like e. g. hydrothermal vents, cold seeps and beneath fish farms, where filamentous mat-forming bacteria also occur. In this thesis, nine new species from two polychaete families are described from whale-falls and fish farms in Scandinavian waters, and from whale-falls and sunken wood off the Californian coast. Their phylogeny is investigated using molecular data. The genetic data are further used to separate morphologically cryptic species from ephemeral habitats in different ocean basins...|$|R
40|$|Bottom trawl fishing has {{widespread}} {{impacts on}} benthic habitats and communities. The benthic response to trawling {{seems to be}} smaller or absent in areas exposed to high natural disturbance, leading to the hypothesis that natural and trawl disturbance affect benthic communities in a similar way. However, systematic tests of this hypothesis at large spatial scales and with data from sites spanning a large range of natural disturbance do not exist. Here, we {{examine the effects of}} trawl and natural (tidal-bed shear stress) disturbance on benthic communities over gradients of commercial bottom trawling effort in 8 areas in the North and Irish Seas. Using a traitbased approach, that classified species by life-history strategies or by characteristics that provide a proxy for their role in community function, we found support for the hypothesis that trawl and natural disturbance affect benthic communities in similar ways. Both sources of disturbance caused declines in long-living, hard-bodied (exoskeleton) and suspension-feeding organisms. Given these similar impacts, there was no detectable trawling effect on communities exposed to high natural disturbance. Conversely, in 3 out of 5 areas with low bed shear stress, responses to trawling were detected and resulted in community compositions comparable with those in areas subject to high natural disturbance, with communities being composed of either small-sized, deposit-feeding animals or <b>mobile</b> <b>scavengers</b> and predators. The findings highlight that knowledge of the interacting effects of trawl and natural disturbance will help to identify areas that are more or less resilient to trawling and support the development of management plans that account for the environmental effects of fishing. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{long-term}} lander {{employing a}} baited camera system {{was developed to}} study temporal variation {{in the presence of}} scavenging fish and invertebrates at a cold-water coral community on Galway Mound (Belgica Mound Province, NE Atlantic). The camera system was tested during two successful long-term deployments for periods of 6 and 12 months respectively. The baited system, consisting of two separate video cameras with infrared lights and a bait dispenser with 24 bait positions, recorded more than 15, 500 clips of 17 s, regularly spread over both periods. New bait, consisting of sardines in oil, was offered at regular time intervals, and attracted scavengers over the whole period of deployment, and especially the crab Chaceon affinis did still eat from it till the end of the deployments. However, the attractiveness for some scavengers, i. e. amphipods, diminished quite quickly. In addition to invertebrate scavengers, namely C. affinis, two other crab species, amphipods, a shrimp and a starfish, also 7 species of fish were recorded near the bait, of which Lepidion eques was by far the most common. Though there was no concrete evidence for seasonal patterns, the observations showed substantial temporal variation in the abundance of several species, especially the crabs C. affinis and Bathynectes maravigna and the fish Phycis blennoides. It is concluded that long-term deployments of such a baited camera system can produce novel data. For instance such a system could be employed for monitoring impacts of disturbances on the deep-sea floor (e. g. mining), as we infer that <b>mobile</b> <b>scavengers</b> will be among the first organisms to show a visible reaction to any chemically and physically (noise, vibrations) alteration of the environment similar to a mine canary...|$|R
5|$|In {{almost all}} layers {{arthropods}} {{are the most}} abundant and diverse group of fossils in the GPB, followed by sponges. 69.2% of GPB individuals and 63.9% of species lived {{on the surface of}} the sea bed; within this group, mobile deposit feeders that extracted food particles from the sediment accounted for 38.2% of the total number of individuals and 16.8% of the total species; the smallest sub-group was mobile hunters and scavengers; and the rest were sessile suspension feeders. Animals that lived in the sediment made up 12.7% of the species and 7.4% of the individuals; the largest sub-group was <b>mobile</b> hunters and <b>scavengers.</b> Bottom-dwelling animals capable of swimming comprised 12.7% of species and 7.4% of individuals. Organisms that spent their whole life swimming were very rare, accounting for only 1.5% of individuals and 8.3% of species.|$|R
40|$|Adjacent {{communities}} and ecosystems often differ in underlying productivity but are connected by flows of nutrients, energy, and matter. Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) transport substantial quantities of nutrients from marine ecosystems to coastal freshwater habitats {{when they return}} to spawn and die. Nutrients from their carcasses are initially concentrated in spawning streams and lakes, but are subsequently dispersed by abiotic (floods, hyporheic flow) and biotic processes (predators and scavengers). In southwest Alaska, <b>mobile</b> avian <b>scavengers</b> (gulls; Larus spp.) breed on small islands within salmon nursery lakes and consume large quantities of spawning salmon during the chick-rearing period. However the role of birds as vectors of salmon-derived nutrients remains unknown. We examined how gulls by transporting salmon tissues to their chicks create hotspots of biological productivity in the aquatic habitats surrounding their nesting colonies. We found that algal production was / 10 / higher at islands with high gull densities compared to islands without nesting gulls, but was concentrated within 40 m of island shorelines. Carbon stable isotopes (d 13 C) confirmed that gulls enhance primary production in local benthic {{communities and}} demonstrated that this production was transferred up the food web to grazers (snails) and carnivores (blackfish). Nitrogen stable isotopes (d 15 N) confirmed that salmon dominated the diet of gulls and that nutrients from gull guano were incorporated into algae and passed up the food web. By relocating and concentrating salmon-derived nutrients into new and distant locations, gulls alter and magnify production in local aquatic communities. We offer the first evidence that the avian community can move salmon-derived nutrients great distances, enriching otherwise isolated habitats...|$|R
40|$|Submarine cliffs are {{typically}} crowded with sessile organisms, {{most of which}} are ultimately exported downwards. Here we report a 24 month study of benthic fauna dropping from such cliffs at sites of differing cliff angle and flow rates at Lough Hyne Marine Nature Reserve, Co. Cork, Ireland. The magnitude of 'fall out' material collected in capture nets was highly seasonal and composed of sessile and mobile elements. Sponges, ascidians, cnidarians, polychaetes, bryozoans and barnacles dominated the sessile forms. The remainder (<b>mobile</b> fauna) were <b>scavengers</b> and predators such as asteroid echinoderms, gastropod molluscs and malacostracan crustaceans. These were probably migrants targeting fallen sessile organisms. 'Fall out' material (including mobile forms) increased between May and August in both years. This increase in 'fall out' material was correlated with wrasse abundance at the cliffs (with a one month lag period). The activities of the wrasse on the cliffs (feeding, nest building and territory defence) were considered responsible for the majority of 'fall out' material, with natural mortality and the activity of other large mobile organisms (e. g. crustaceans) also being triplicated. Current flow rate and cliff profile were important in amount of 'fall out' material collected. In low current situations export of fallen material was vertical, while both horizontal and vertical export was associated with moderate to high current environments. Higher 'fall out' was associated with overhanging than vertical cliff surfaces. The 'fall out' of marine organisms in low current situations is likely to provide ail important source of nutrition in close proximity to the cliff, in an otherwise impoverished soft sediment habitat. However, in high current areas material will be exported some distance from the source, with final settlement again occurring in soft sediment habitats (as current speed decreases) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to produce a series of Conceptual Ecological Models (CEMs) that {{represent}} the shallow sublittoral mud habitat in the UK. CEMs are diagrammatic representations of the influences and processes that occur within an ecosystem. The models can be used to identify critical aspects of an ecosystem that may be developed for further study, or serve as the basis for the selection of indicators for environmental monitoring purposes. The models produced by this project are âcontrol diagramsâ, representing the unimpacted state of the environment, free from anthropogenic pressures. It is intended that the models produced by this project will be used to guide indicator selection for the monitoring of this habitat in UK waters. CEMs will eventually be produced for a range of habitat types defined under the UK Marine Biodiversity Monitoring R&D Programme (UKMBMP), which, along with stressor models designed to show the interactions within impacted habitats, would form the basis of a robust method for indicator selection. This project builds on the work to develop CEMs for shallow sublittoral coarse sediment habitats (Alexander. 2014). The project scope included the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) predominant habitat type âshallow sublittoral mudâ. This definition includes those habitats that fall into the EUNIS Level 4 classifications A 5. 33 Infralittoral Sandy Mud, A 5. 34 Infralittoral Fine Mud, A 5. 35 Circalittoral Sandy Mud and A 5. 36 Circalittoral Fine Mud, along with their constituent Level 5 biotopes which are relevant to UK waters. A species list of characterising fauna to be included within the scope of the models was identified using an iterative process to refine the full list of species found within the relevant Level 5 biotopes. A literature review was conducted using a pragmatic and iterative approach to gather evidence regarding species traits and information that would be used to inform the models and the interactions that occur within the shallow sublittoral mud habitat. All information gathered during the literature review was entered into a data logging pro forma spreadsheet which accompanies this report. Wherever possible, attempts were made to collect information from UK-specific peer-reviewed studies, although other sources were used where necessary. All data gathered was subject to a detailed confidence assessment. Expert judgement by the project team was utilised to provide information for aspects of the models for which references could not be sourced within the project timeframe. A model hierarchy was developed based on groups of fauna with similar species traits which aligned with previous sensitivity studies of ecological groups. One general control model was produced that indicated the high level drivers, inputs, biological assemblages, ecosystem processes and outputs that occur in shallow sublittoral mud habitats. In addition to this, five detailed sub-models were produced, which each focussed on a particular functional group of fauna within the habitat: tube building fauna, burrowing fauna, suspension and deposit feeding infauna, <b>mobile</b> epifauna, <b>scavengers</b> and predators, and echinoderms and sessile epifauna. Each sub-model is accompanied by an associated confidence model that presents confidence in the links between each model component. The models are split into seven levels and take spatial and temporal scale into account through their design, as well as magnitude and direction of influence. The seven levels include regional to global drivers, water column processes, local inputs/processes at the seabed, habitat and biological assemblage, output processes, local ecosystem functions, and regional to global ecosystem functions. The models indicate that whereas the high level drivers which affect each functional group are largely similar, the output processes performed by the biota and the resulting ecosystem functions vary both in number and importance between groups. Confidence within the Conceptual Ecological Modelling of Shallow Sublittoral Mud Habitats models as a whole is generally high, reflecting the level of information gathered during the literature review. Important drivers that influence the ecosystem include factors such as wave exposure, depth, water currents, climate and propagule supply. These factors, in combination with seabed and water column processes, such as primary production, suspended sediments, water chemistry, temperature and recruitment define and influence the food sources consumed by the biological assemblages of the habitat, and the biological assemblages themselves. In addition, the habitat sediment type plays an important factor in shaping the biology of the habitat. Output processes performed by the biological assemblage are variable between functional faunal groups depending on the specific fauna present and the role they perform within the ecosystem. Important processes include secondary production, biodeposition, bioturbation, bioengineering and the supply of propagules; these in turn influence ecosystem functions at the local scale such as nutrient and biogeochemical cycling, supply of food resources, sediment stability, habitat provision and in some cases microbial activity. The export of biodiversity and organic matter, biodiversity enhancement and biotope stability are the resulting ecosystem functions that occur at the regional to global scale. Features within the models that are most useful for monitoring habitat status and change due to natural variation have been identified; as have those which may be useful for monitoring to identify anthropogenic causes of change within the ecosystem. Physical and chemical features of the ecosystem have mostly been identified as potential indicators to monitor natural variation, whilst biological factors have predominantly been identified as most likely to indicate change due to anthropogenic pressures...|$|R
