40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the reproductive and pregnancy outcomes of women after previous Cesarean Scar Pregnancy. Materials and methods: From January 2009 to December 2013, {{a total of}} 214 patients with CSP received surgical evacuation treatment by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>dilation</b> and suction evacuation and local resection of the ectopic gestational mass. A telephone follow-up was conducted every year after CSP treatment. The follow-up was ended on December 2014. Results: Twenty-five patients were lost to follow-up due to loss of contacts. The previous medical records of the remaining 189 women were reviewed. Fifty-eight women wished to give birth again. However, 48 (82. 8 %, 48 / 58) of them stopped the attempts to get pregnant {{because they were afraid}} of recurrent CSP and the high risk of uterine rupture during the subsequent pregnancy. The other 10 women spontaneously attempted to get pregnant again, among whom 6 (60 %, 6 / 10) succeeded with the birth of 7 healthy babies. A total of 32 women conceived again, either in plan or by chance. Five women (15. 6 %, 5 / 32) experiencing recurrent CSP. Conclusion: Even though our result did not necessarily represent the true recurrence rate, our study provided some evidence about the likelihood of fertility and recurrence risk for future pregnancies after previous CSP...|$|E
40|$|Background: Carbon {{tetrachloride}} (CCl 4) is {{a potent}} nephrotoxin, as it causes acute as well as chronic toxicity in kidneys. Therefore, this study was carried out to assess the pharmacological potential of different fractions of Carissa opaca fruits on CCl 4 -induced oxidative trauma in the kidney. Methods: The parameters studied in this respect were the kidney function tests viz, serum profile, urine profile, genotoxicity, characteristic morphological findings, and antioxidant enzymatic level of kidneys. Result: The protective effects of various fractions of C. opaca fruits against CCl 4 administration were reviewed by rat renal function alterations. Chronic toxicity caused by 8 -week treatment of CCl 4 to the rats significantly decreased the pH level, activities of antioxidant enzymes, and glutathione contents, whereas a significant increase {{was found in the}} case of specific gravity, red blood cells, white blood cells, level of urea, and lipid peroxidation in comparison to control group. Administration of various fractions of C. opaca fruit with CCl 4 showed protective ability against CCl 4 intoxication by restoring the urine profile, activities of antioxidant enzymes, and lipid peroxidation in rat.

40|$|ObjectiveCongenital heart defects with a {{component}} of pulmonary stenosis are often palliated in childhood by disrupting the pulmonary valve, either by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>dilation</b> or excision. It is unclear what factors affect a patient's ability to tolerate long-term pulmonary insufficiency before requiring pulmonary valve replacement. We analyze potential factors {{that are related to}} the interval between pulmonary valve disruption and pulmonary valve replacement. MethodsOne hundred seven patients were analyzed. They had a congenital diagnosis of pulmonary stenosis or tetralogy of Fallot, had their first pulmonary valve replacement between 2002 and 2008, and had a known interval between pulmonary valve disruption and pulmonary valve replacement. The median age at the time of surgical intervention was 2 years for pulmonary valve disruption (range, 0 – 56 years) and 26 years for pulmonary valve replacement (range, 1 – 72 years). The median interval was 23 years (range, 0 – 51 years). Potential related factors were sex, race, initial diagnosis and procedure, age at pulmonary valve disruption, prior shunt operation, presence of branch pulmonary artery stenosis, and degree of pulmonary regurgitation. ResultsAs determined by using univariate analysis, male patients had a shorter interval than female patients (median, 16 vs 26 years; P =. 01), and African American patients had a shorter interval than white patients (median, 16 vs 25 years; P =. 049). A significant correlation was also identified between age at the time of pulmonary valve disruption and the subsequent interval to pulmonary valve replacement. Overall, the interval tended to increase as age at disruption increased (P <. 0001). Although the presence of branch pulmonary artery stenosis determined by the need for concomitant pulmonary arterioplasty was associated with a significantly shorter interval to pulmonary valve replacement (21 vs 24 years, P =. 02), stenosis determined based on small branch pulmonary artery diameter was correlated to a prolonged interval to pulmonary valve replacement (P =. 009). Initial diagnosis, prior palliative shunt operation, and degree of pulmonary regurgitation had no effect on the interval between pulmonary valve disruption and subsequent pulmonary valve replacement. As determined by using multivariate analysis, only male sex and small pulmonary artery diameter remained significant factors. ConclusionsMale sex appears to shorten the interval between pulmonary valve disruption and pulmonary valve replacement, whereas small branch pulmonary artery diameter appears to lengthen the interval. Knowing which factors are detrimental and which are protective might help identify patients who are prone to a more rapid progression of right heart failure from free pulmonary insufficiency, possibly steering them toward more frequent follow-up or more aggressive heart failure medical regimens...|$|E

Various endoscopic dilation techniques have been reported, {{but none of}} these methods has been proven to be superior. Objective: Comparison of the efficacy and safety <b>of</b> <b>dilation</b> <b>of</b> previously untreated anastomotic strictures by using electrocautery incision (EI) and Savary bougienage (SB). Design: Randomized, prospective study Setting: Multicenter study Patients: Sixty-two patients with an anastomotic stricture after esophagogastrostomy and dysphagia Atkinson grades II to IV were included. Interventions: Patients were treated with El or SB. Main Outcome Measurements: Objective and subjective results were compared with baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months after the first treatment. Complications of both treatments were noted. Primary endpoints after 6 months were the <b>mean</b> number <b>of</b> <b>dilation</b> sessions and success rate (percentage of patients with <= 5 dilations in 6 months). Study participation ended after 6 months or if dysphagia grades 11 to IV recurred despite 5 treatment sessions. Results: No complications occurred with both treatments, There {{was no significant difference between}} the El and SB groups in the <b>mean</b> number <b>of</b> <b>dilations</b> (2. 9; 95 % Cl, 2. 7 - 4. 1 vs 3. 3; 95 % Cl, 2. 3 - 3. 61; P =. 46) or the success rate (80. 6 % vs 67. 7 %, P =. 26 and 96. 2 % vs 80. 8 %, P =. 19).

50|$|A {{method to}} treat {{ejaculatory}} duct obstruction is transurethral resection of the ejaculatory ducts (TURED).

Methods: Thirty-four patients who underwent aortoiliac or aortofemoral bifurcation grafting were randomized to receive a collagen-sealed warp-knitted polyester graft (n = 16 patients) or a gelatin-sealed Koper-knitted polyester graft (n = 18 patients). Alterations in size of all parts of the grafts were evaluated by helical computed tomographic scanning at postoperative day 8, at 3 months, and at 6 months. Results: On postoperative day 8, the <b>mean</b> <b>dilation</b> <b>of</b> the Koper-knitted grafts was 18 % +/- 8 % for the stem and 15 % +/- 12 % for the limbs.

40|$|The aim of all current {{forms of}} {{treatment}} of achalasia is {{to enable the}} patient to eat without disabling symptoms such as dysphagia, regurgitation, coughing or choking. Historically, this has been accomplished by mechanical disruption of the lower esophageal sphincter fibres, either by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> pneumatic <b>dilation</b> (PD) or by open surgical myotomy.

40|$|Objectives: gastric bypass is the {{surgical}} procedure that {{is carried out}} most frequently {{in the treatment of}} morbid obesity. Stenosis of the gastro-jejunal anastomosis is a relatively frequent complication that requires endoscopic management. However, the optimal dilation technique is yet to be determined. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the safety and efficacy <b>of</b> <b>dilation</b> with a hydrostatic balloon (CRE) without radioscopic guidance in morbidly obese patients treated by laparoscopic bypass. Material and methods: retrospective review of the data elicited from 525 patients treated against morbid obesity with laparoscopic gastric bypass from January, 2006 to November, 2010. Results: a total of 22 / 525 patients (4. 1 %) developed stenosis of the anastomosis [20 women (91 %), 2 men (9 %) ]. In four patients (18. 2 %), there was an associated anastomotic ulcer, and in one case, there was a history of bleeding of an ulcer treated with sclerosis one month earlier. The diagnosis of stenosis was done in most patients during the first 90 days after the bypass. All cases were resolved by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> endoscopic <b>dilation</b> without radioscopic guidance, 15 cases (68. 1 %) required a single session, 6 cases (27. 2 %) two sessions, and 1 case (4. 5 %) required four sessions. This last case had an associated anastomotic ulcer. The diameter of the balloons ranged from 12 to 20 mm, generally using diameters of 12 - 15 mm in the first session, and increasing them in the following sessions according to the previous result. One patient treated with a 20 mm balloon presented with a small tear, without showing any evidence of leak of contrast medium in the radioscopic guidance, and was thus managed conservatively. In the follow-up, no re-stenoses were detected. Conclusions: in our experience, stenosis of the anastomosis in the laparoscopic gastric bypass is an infrequent complication. When it happens, dilation with a hydrostatic balloon is an effective and safe treatment.

Investigations also included body composition, carotid intimal-media thickness (c-IMT), ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (BP), fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides (TG), cholesterol levels (HDL-C and LDL-C), and plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF).

It has been proposed that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show a deviant processing of social cues throughout their social cognitive development. However, social cues do not always convey an intention to communicate. Hence, the aim {{of this study was to}} test the sensitivity of adolescents and adults with ASD and neurotypical controls to social cues of high communicative (pointing) and low communicative values (grasping). For this purpose, we employed a spatial cueing paradigm with both Cue Types and compared saccadic reaction times (SRTs) between conditions in which the target appeared at a location which was congruent versus incongruent with the direction of the cue. Results showed that both adolescents and adults with ASD had slower SRTs for the incongruent relative to the congruent condition for both Cue Types, reflecting sensitivity to these cues. Additionally, mental effort during the processing of these social cues was assessed by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> pupil <b>dilation.</b> This analysis revealed that, while individuals with and without ASD required more mental effort to process incongruent compared to the congruent cues, cues with higher communicative value posed more processing load for the ASD group.

40|$|Astrocytes play an {{important}} role in regulating neuronal activity and local brain states, in part by serving as intermediaries between neurons and vasculature. We postulate that neurons and astrocytes are sensitive to biophysical conditions in their local environment, in addition to their participation in traditional signaling networks with other neurons. Mechanically sensitive astrocytic endfeet ensheathe cerebral blood vessels, which change size in order to regulate blood flow. We found that changes in local biophysical state caused by mechanical perturbations exerted through blood vessels can depolarize astrocytes and some neurons in slice. To test the hemoneural hypothesis in vivo, we developed a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> inducing <b>dilation</b> using the SUR 2 B receptor agonist pinacidil, which is specific to vascular smooth muscle. It was important to ascertain that pinacidil had no direct effect on astrocytes or neurons, and we confirmed this in whole cell recordings in cortical slices. We then used two-photon imaging to visualize astrocytic calcium dynamics in vivo while manipulating vasodilation in vivo. Pinacidil caused a 10 - 20 % dilation in most vessels, a degree <b>of</b> <b>dilation</b> <b>of</b> similar magnitude to those naturally evoked by persistent sensory stimulation (e. g. in fMRI studies). We found that increases in pial arteriole diameter could occasionally evoke traveling calcium waves in astrocytes. We also saw consistently slow increases (which took tens of seconds to onset, and persisted for minutes) in astrocytic calcium levels at both endfeet and soma in cortical layer 1, corresponding to vessel dilation. When vessels partially reconstricted due to pinacidil washout, calcium levels also showed a relative decrease. At short time scales (from 0. 5 - 5 seconds) we saw strong correlations (> 0. 5) between small fluctuations in astrocytic calcium levels (1 - 3 %) and vessel diameter (1 - 3 %). Fluctuations in vessel diameter predicted similar fluctuations in astrocytic calcium, as often and as strongly as the reverse, suggesting feedback regulation between vascular diameter and astrocytic calcium activation levels. by Rosa Cao.

Eroding the image results in the elimination of smaller shadows, while dilation causes the insect and its shadow to merge into a single blob. Figure  3 illustrates the effect <b>of</b> <b>dilation</b> and erosion on an insect blob and its shadow. Typically, a series of erosions followed by a series <b>of</b> <b>dilations</b> are applied, or vice versa. Because the size of the shadow often depends on the time of the day and the actual size of the insect, the appropriate sequence <b>of</b> <b>dilation</b> and erosion operations must be determined empirically.|$|R

Three distinct limiting stress envelopes are identified, based on (a) the start <b>of</b> <b>dilation,</b> (b) the maximum stress ratio during dilation, and (c) possible critical states. At effective cell pressures of 100 kPa and below, the stress ratio at the start <b>of</b> <b>dilation</b> is close to the maximum during subsequent dilation and much greater than at the critical state. At higher cell pressures, the material behaves more conventionally in that the maximum stress ratios are more clearly linked to maximum rates <b>of</b> <b>dilation.</b> The role and significance <b>of</b> <b>dilation</b> in a locked sand are discussed with reference to the development of strain localisations into shear planes, thin sections from samples subjected to differeing degrees of shear, and tests on unstructured sands...|$|R
