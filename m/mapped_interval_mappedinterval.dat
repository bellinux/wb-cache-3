40|$|A major {{objective}} for geneticists is {{to decipher}} genetic architecture of traits associated with agronomic importance. However, {{a majority of}} such traits are complex, and their genetic dissection has been traditionally hampered {{not only by the}} number of minor-effect quantitative trait loci (QTL) but also by genome-wide interacting loci with little or no individual effect. Soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr.) seed isoflavonoids display a broad range of variation, even in genetically stabilized lines that grow in a fixed environment, because their synthesis and accumulation are affected by many biotic and abiotic factors. Due to this complexity, isoflavone QTL mapping has often produced conflicting results especially with variable growing conditions. Herein, we comparatively mapped soybean seed isoflavones genistein, daidzein, and glycitein by using several of the most commonly used <b>mapping</b> approaches: <b>interval</b> <b>mapping,</b> composite <b>interval</b> <b>mapping,</b> multiple <b>interval</b> <b>mapping</b> and a mixed-model based composite <b>interval</b> <b>mapping.</b> In total, 26 QTLs, including many novel regions, were found bearing additive main effects in a population of RILs derived from the cross between Essex and PI 437654. Our comparative approach demonstrates that statistical mapping methodologies are crucial for QTL discovery in complex traits. Despite a previous understanding of the influence of additive QTL on isoflavone production, the role of epistasis is not well established. Results indicate that epistasis, although largely dependent on the environment, is a very important genetic component underlying seed isoflavone content, and suggest epistasis as a key factor causing the observed phenotypic variability of these traits in diverse environments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Accurate genetic {{maps are}} {{required}} for successful and efficient linkage mapping of disease genes. However, most available genome-wide genetic maps were built using only small collections of pedigrees, and therefore have large sampling errors. A large set of genetic studies genotyped by the NHLBI Mammalian Genotyping Service (MGS) provide appropriate data for generating more accurate maps. Results We collected a large sample of uncleaned genotype data for 461 markers generated by the MGS using the Weber screening sets 9 and 10. This collection includes genotypes for over 4, 400 pedigrees containing over 17, 000 genotyped individuals from different populations. We identified and cleaned numerous relationship and genotyping errors, as well as verified the marker orders. We used this dataset to test for population-specific genetic maps, and to re-estimate the genetic map distances with greater precision; standard errors for all intervals are provided. The map-interval sizes from the European (or European descent), Chinese, and Hispanic samples are in quite good agreement with each other. We found one <b>map</b> <b>interval</b> on chromosome 8 p with a statistically significant size difference between the European and Chinese samples, and several <b>map</b> <b>intervals</b> with significant size differences between the African American and Chinese samples. When comparing Palauan with European samples, {{a statistically significant difference}} was detected at the telomeric region of chromosome 11 p. Several significant differences were also identified between populations in chromosomal and genome lengths. Conclusions Our new population-specific screening set maps can be used to improve the accuracy of disease-mapping studies. As a result of the large sample size, the average length of the 95 % confidence interval (CI) for a 10 cM <b>map</b> <b>interval</b> is only 2. 4 cM, which is considerably smaller than on previously published maps. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT – The present work {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} and identify QTLs for wood quality and growth traits in E. grandis x E. urophylla hybrids. For this purpose a RAPD linkage map {{was developed for}} the hybrids (LOD= 3 and r= 0. 40) containing 52 markers and 12 linkage groups. Traits related to wood quality and growth were evaluated in the QTL analyses. QTL analyses were performed using chi-square tests, single-marker, <b>interval</b> <b>mapping</b> and composite <b>interval</b> <b>mapping</b> analyses. All approaches led to the identification of similar QTLs associated with wood density, cellulose pulp yield and percentage of extractives, which were detected and confirmed by both the <b>interval</b> <b>mapping</b> and composite <b>interval</b> <b>mapping</b> methodologies. Some QTLs regions were confirmed only by the composite <b>interval</b> <b>mapping</b> methodology: percentage of soluble lignin, percentage of insoluble lignin, CBH and total height. Overlapping QTLs regions were detected, and these, can {{be the result of}} major genes involved in the regulation and control of the growth traits by epistatic interactions. In order to evaluate the effect of early selection using RAPD molecular data, molecular markers adjacent to QTLs were used genotype selection. The analysis of selection differential values suggests that for all the traits the phenotypic selection at seven years should generate larger genetic gains than early selection assisted by molecular markers and the combination of the strategies should elevate the selection efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Composite <b>interval</b> <b>mapping</b> (CIM) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used method for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) with populations derived from biparental crosses. However, the algorithm implemented in the popular QTL Cartographer software may not completely ensure all its advantageous properties.

A modified algorithm called inclusive composite <b>interval</b> <b>mapping</b> (ICIM) is proposed in this article. In ICIM, marker selection is conducted only once through stepwise regression by considering all marker information simultaneously, and the phenotypic values are then adjusted by all markers retained in the regression equation except the two markers flanking the current <b>mapping</b> <b>interval.</b> The adjusted phenotypic values are finally used in <b>interval</b> <b>mapping</b> (IM).

40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} on gene mapping analysis. For the first study, genetic simulation experiments were conducted to address the effects of marker density, method of mapping analysis, and gaps in a marker map on the efficiency of QTL detection and the accuracy of QTL parameter estimation. The simulated genome consisted of seven chromosomes with seven or eight segregating QTL affecting the simulated quantitative trait. A set of six randomly segregating QTL outside the test region was consistently used to represent 40 % of phenotypic variation. An individual QTL or a linkage block of two QTL on a target chromosome contributed 10 % of phenotypic variation. The marker map was either dense (with markers every 4 cM) or sparse (with markers every 20 cM). The gap in the marker map was either 32 cM or 56 cM. <b>Interval</b> <b>mapping</b> and composite <b>interval</b> <b>mapping</b> were used to map QTL on the target chromosome. A dense map provided more power of QTL detection, better accuracy of QTL parameter estimation, and higher false-positive error rates for the target chromosome than a sparse <b>map.</b> Composite <b>interval</b> <b>mapping</b> provided more power of QTL detection, better accuracy of QTL parameter estimation, and lower false-positive error rates than <b>interval</b> <b>mapping.</b> Presence of a large gap in a marker map affected QTL detection and QTL parameter estimation for a QTL inside or near the gap.
