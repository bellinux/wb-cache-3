40|$|Cage {{induction}} motors {{are widely}} used in industries because of their rugged construction and low cost. The drawback with an induction motor is that, it draws high <b>magnetising</b> <b>current.</b> The <b>magnetising</b> <b>current</b> drawn by an induction motor depends on air gap length between stator and rotor, and shape of stator slots. Air gap length in an induction motor is already very less; therefore it is not reduced below a certain level. There are three shapes of stator slots- parallel sided, tapered and circular; generally, the tapered or parallel sided shape of stator slot is adopted by manufacturers of induction motors. Here, a comparative study on performance of 3 KWinduction motor with different shape of stator slots is presented. It is shown that, the induction motor with circular shape of stator slots shows better efficiency, reduced <b>magnetising</b> <b>current</b> and better overload capacity, than the motors with other shapes of stator slots. Therefore, circular shape of stator slot is {{the best choice for}} 3 KW induction motor...|$|E
40|$|Primary {{windings}} of transformers are {{fed with}} alternating sinusoidal voltage, but often this voltage contains small DC offset due to unsymmetrical voltage levels. To emulate such working conditions {{in a controlled}} environment (Epstein frame) the excitation waveforms were emulated as a DC voltage superimposed on an AC waveform. This resulted in non symmetrical excitation of the core steel.

The model parameters are obtained from the finite element held solutions. The saturation of the motor is taken into account in calculation of the flux distribution by using a static non-linear vector potential solution. The linear time harmonic vector potential, field solution is used for the inductances determination. All the inductances are determined as functions of the <b>magnetising</b> <b>current.</b> Rotor skew is also taken into account.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a new three-limb three-phase electromagnetic transformer {{model in the}} Harmonic Domain. It is a composite model, with the linear circuit represented by the short-circuit impedances, and the non-linear magnetic circuit represented in a linearised form by means of Norton equivalents. The proposed Norton equivalents accurately represent the magnetic circuit, as they are derived from the linearisation (in the Harmonic Domain) of individual magnetising characteristics for the magnetic branches and the magnetic circuit laws. A Newton-Raphson iterative procedure is also developed to accurately determine the non-linear distribution of the magnetic fluxes. The influence of the magnetising characteristic approximation upon the harmonic solution is investigated. The adequacy of several approximations, including cubic splines, are assessed and Singular Value Decomposition have been explored to determine the equation parameters. The widely accepted assumption of equally distributing the <b>magnetising</b> <b>currents</b> between the primary and secondary terminals is also investigated. For single-phase transformer models this assumption is shown to be inaccurate, at harmonic frequencies, and inadequate, for star-connected three-phase transformer models and improved harmonic distribution factors for the <b>magnetising</b> <b>currents</b> are proposed. Three-phase three-limb electromagnetic transformer models for {{the most commonly used}} winding electrical configurations are derived, and the simulations results analysed by means of sensitivity analysis and comparisons with the practical and theoretical knowledge reported in the literature...|$|R
5000|$|An over-excited {{synchronous}} motor has a leading power factor. This makes it useful for {{power factor correction}} of industrial loads. Both transformers and induction motors draw lagging (<b>magnetising)</b> <b>currents</b> from the line. On light loads, the power drawn by induction motors has a large reactive component and the power factor has a low value. The added current flowing to supply reactive power creates additional losses in the power system. In an industrial plant, {{synchronous motor}}s {{can be used to}} supply some of the reactive power required by induction motors. This improves the plant power factor and reduces the reactive current required from the grid.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an {{amorphous}} core transformer is highlighted. Configuration of amorphous C-core and its magnetisation characteristic (B-H) are described. Factors {{affecting the}} design are also discussed as a comparison with a conventional transformer. It is concluded that, advantages with amorphous core transformers are- low core losses, low <b>magnetising</b> <b>current,</b> less zero sequence current, less noise, higher efficiency and longer life; however the disadvantages are higher inrush current, more harmonic problem, bigger size and higher initial cost. The problem of third harmonic may be eliminated by adopting zig-zag connection {{in place of}} star connection. Purpose {{of this article is}} to provide a knowledge base about amorphous core transformers, to students of transformer design, by discussing some necessary issues...|$|E
40|$|Amorphous alloy {{is being}} seen as a good {{substitute}} of grain oriented steel; it has low core loss, less <b>magnetising</b> <b>current</b> and less noise, compared to grain oriented steel. It is being used in transformers as a core material nowadays. Amorphous alloy is available in form of C-core structure. In synchronous machines open slots are preferred on armature side; so, {{there is a possibility}} of developing a structure with open slots, by placing C-cores side by side, on armature side. Here, a synchronous machine with amorphous C-core structure is proposed; the performance of proposed synchronous machine is evaluated and compared with conventional synchronous machine. It is found that the efficiency of proposed synchronous machine is higher than that of conventional synchronous machine...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{an active}} clamp circuit over the famous RCD clamp is due to its superiority for its better efficiency, more duty cycle, lower current stress and no energy {{dissipation}} as the <b>magnetising</b> <b>current</b> is recycled and used again. The use of the transformer instead of the normal buck converter is because by using a transformer the voltage can be stepped down to quite a low value, i. e. more than 2 times less of the input voltage which was not possible in the buck converter. The use of synchronous rectification {{is to increase the}} efficiency of the system, as the body diode conduction losses are quite low for a Mosfet and thus less heat produced in using that. The circuit for a forward converter with an active clamp and transformer reset is made with the synchronous rectificatio...|$|E
40|$|There are {{a number}} of areas of {{research}} for transformers at present which are focussed on reducing the losses in transformer cores as well as the steel weight. One way to reduce core losses is to remove the core altogether making an air-core transformer which have been primarily used in pulse transformers and superconducting transformers However these designs have issues with large <b>magnetising</b> <b>currents.</b> Alternatively, the use of partial-core transformers (PCT), which have been developed as resonant test transformers, power transformers, and superconducting transformers, {{can be seen as a}} compromise between the transformer performance and a reduction in the use of materials. In a PCT there is a steel core down the centre of the windings, however the steel limbs and yoke of a traditional core have been removed as shown in Figure 1. As the remainder of the magnetic flux path is now through air instead of steel, there is a much higher reluctance path in a PCT than a full core transformer [5]. The University of Canterbury (UoC) has developed a number of partial-core transformers (PCTs) in an attempt to reduce the electrical losses of the PCTs. Towards the ends of the core in a PCT, the magnetic flux tends to spread outwards radially within the core. This increases the eddy current losses in the core compared to that seen in traditional full core design. Thus, PCT designs tend to have significantly higher eddy current losses per unit weight in the core compared with full core counterparts. This paper starts by providing a background into partial core transformers and their applications as well as a look into the performance of transformer steel. A radially laminated core is then designed and constructed to be compared with a traditional parallel stacked core for use in PCT. The two cores have been tested under open circuit conditions and their core losses computed from measured results. The core losses have also been compared to the modelled core loss as a test of the model accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{changing}} {{magnetic field}} will induce eddy currents in the conductor. These currents will dissipate {{energy in the}} conductor and generate drag force. It is found that Aluminium is the best material as conductor compared to Copper and Zinc. Also, {{it is found that}} the larger thickness of disc, more number of turns of electromagnet and higher electrical conductivity of conductor influences the generation of greater braking torque. Permanent magnet eddy current brake uses Neodymium – Iron – Boron (NdFeB) magnets. The analysis of permanent magnet eddy current shows that the parallel <b>magnetised</b> eddy <b>current</b> topology has the superior braking torque capability. In electrically controlled eddy current braking system subjected to time varying fields in different wave forms, the triangular wave field application resulted in highest braking torque. Electromagnetic brakes were found to interfere with the signalling and train control system. Permanent magnet eddy current brakes are a simple and reliable alternative to mechanical or electromagnetic brakes in transportation applications. Greater the speed greater is the eddy current braking efficiency. Hence, author intends to work on the development and investigation of permanent magnet eddy current braking system...|$|R
40|$|The Institution of Engineering and Technology. High {{impedance}} fault (HIF) {{has long}} been a challenging problem in network protection due to its random behaviour and low magnitude. The conventional protection devices cannot be utilised since the HIF does not draw enough current to cause tripping. The feature of wavelet transform (WT) which decomposes a signal into different frequency bands and locations in time can be utilised to extract HIF features and detect its occurrence. In the study, HIF arcing currents associated with different types of contact surface are produced by experiments set up in the laboratory. Features of the fault currents are extracted and a new detection criterion is developed based on WT coefficients. Transformer <b>magnetising</b> inrush <b>currents</b> and capacitor switching transients are also produced by experiment and simulation, respectively, to represent transient disturbances commonly occurred in the distribution network. The detection criterion is used to discriminate the HIF from other normal non-fault transient events. Three different types of wavelet are tested and the Daubechies wavelet Db 4 gives the best performance based on its detection and discrimination rates. The efficacy of utilising existing conventional current transformers for HIF application is also tested and verified by experiment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{high voltage}} partial core {{resonating}} transformer {{has been designed}} and constructed such that its <b>magnetising</b> <b>current</b> reactance is matched to the reactive current drawn by the capacitance of an arc-sign. The supply only provides the real power losses of the transformer plus any reactive power mismatch between the magnetizing reactance and the capacitance of the arc-sign. A mathematical model of the transformer is developed using a reverse design modelling technique. The model is then used to design a 50 Hz, 8 kVA, 230 V/ 80 kV, partial core transformer to meet the required electrical demand of the load. The transformer was constructed and tested. The transformer successfully resonated with the load and provided 68 VAr of compensation when operating at 10 kV while being supplied from a domestic 230 V, 10 A, power outlet. The completed transformer has a finished weight of 69 kg and has been successfully used for powering an arc-sign at an exhibition of electric sculptures. ...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{methods of}} {{isolated}} MOSFET/IGBT gate drive are presented, and their {{pros and cons}} assessed. The best options are chosen to meet our objective — a small, high speed, low cost, low power isolated gate drive module. Two small ferrite bead transformers are used for isolation, one transmits power at 2. 5 MHz, the other sends narrow set reset pulses. On the secondary these pulses drive a transistor totem pole to ensure high current drive, and the value is held by CMOS buffers with positive feedback. An alternative design for driving logic level devices uses only an HC buffer on the secondary. Double sided SMD construction (primary one side, secondary on the other) yields an upright module 40 x 18 x 5 mm. Propagation delay was 20 ns, and rise/fall time 15 ns with a 1 nF load. The design places no limits on frequency of operation or duty cycle. Power supply requirements were 5 V @ 20 mA for operation below 100 kHz, dominated by <b>magnetising</b> <b>current.</b> ...|$|E

The formulation {{is applied to}} create new single-phase, and the first three-limb three-phase PSCAD-EMTDC program transformer models. The new models proposed are validated with laboratory, factory, and field data. Problems associated with magnetically independent phase representations of three-limb three-phase transformers are discussed. Considerable differences are shown in the behaviour of three-phase bank and three-limb three-phase transformers, particularly for the case of in-rush studies.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the main features}} of a 100 kVA high temperature superconducting (HTS) demonstrator generator, which is designed and being built at the University of Southampton. The generator is a 2 -pole synchronous machine with a conventional 3 -phase stator and a HTS rotor operating in the temperature range 57 – 77 K using either liquid nitrogen down to 65 K or liquid air down to 57 K. Liquid air has not been used before in the refrigeration of HTS devices but has recently been commercialised by BOC as a safe alternative to nitrogen for use in freezing of food. The generator will use an existing stator with a bore of 330 mm. The rotor is designed with a magnetic core (invar) to reduce the <b>magnetising</b> <b>current</b> and {{the field in the}} coils. For ease of manufacture, a hybrid salient pole construction is used, and the superconducting winding consists of twelve 50 -turn identical flat coils. Magnetic invar rings will be used between adjacent HTS coils of the winding to divert the normal component of the magnetic field away from the Bi 2223 superconducting tapes. To avoid excessive eddy-current losses in the rotor pole faces, a cold copper screen will be placed around the rotor core to exclude ac magnetic fields...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} programme at the University of Canterbury includes {{the development and}} applications of partial core inductors and transformers for high voltage testing of generator insulation. Unlike a conventional full core transformer, a partial core transformer has no limbs and yokes. A partial core transformer is a compromise between a full core and coreless transformer. It is superior to its full core counterpart as far as cost, weight and ease of transportation are concerned. Partial core transformers have a low magnetising reactance and hence draw a high <b>magnetising</b> <b>current.</b> This characteristic makes them a perfect fit in applications where the load is capacitive in nature, such as a. c. power frequency high voltage testing of generator insulation and cable testing etc. The work carried out for this thesis focuses on automatically controlling the amount of reactive power {{on the supply side}} of a partial core transformer. The considered design includes a third winding around the existing two windings. A power electronic controller is connected to the third winding, which modifies the VAr absorption characteristics of the magnetically coupled supply winding. Two options are considered to achieve continuous reactive power control in the partial core transformer as explained below. First, a thyristor controlled reactor (TCR) is proposed as the VAr controller. It is modelled using PSCAD/EMTDC software. Simulations reveal the design criteria, overall performance and the limitations of the suggested proposal. The TCR connected tertiary winding takes the capacitive burden of the supply. The model demonstrates the ability of the automatically controlled TCR to provide a continuous variation of reactive power without significant under or over compensation. This feature limits the supply current to its real component only, so the supply provides only the losses of the system. Second, a voltage source converter is considered as the VAr controller. This is modelled in PSCAD/EMTDC and a hardware prototype is designed and built. Based on the analysis, the control algorithm (including a digital PI controller) is implemented using an 8 bit micro-controller, PIC 18 LF 4680. The prototype is tested in the laboratory for both active and inductive load conditions as seen from the supply side. Performance of the hardware prototype is discussed in detail. The PSCAD/EMTDC model and the hardware prototype successfully demonstrate the feasibility of a STATCOM controlled partial core transformer. The proposed system is capable of compensating a wide range of capacitive loads as compared with its TCR counterpart. It is proved that the system is very robust and remains dynamically stable for a large system disturbance such as change in load from full capacitive to inductive and vice versa. This confirms that the system is capable of providing continuous VAr control...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} analysis, dynamic {{modelling}} {{and control of}} an isolated selfexcited induction generator (SEIG) driven by a variable speed wind turbine. The voltage build up process of an isolated induction generator excited by AC capacitors starts from charge in the capacitors or from a remnant magnetic field in the core. A similar voltage build up is obtained when the isolated induction generator is excited using an inverter/rectifier system with a single DC capacitor on the DC link of the converter. In this type of excitation the voltage build up starts from a small DC voltage in the DC link and is implemented using vector control. The dynamic voltage, current, power and frequency developed by the induction generator have been analysed, simulated and verified experimentally for the loaded and unloaded conditions while the speed was varied or kept constant. Results which are inaccessible in the experimental setup have been predicted using the simulation algorithm. To model the self excited induction generator accurate values of {{the parameters of the}} induction machine are required. A detailed analysis for the parameter determination of induction machines using a fast data acquisition technique and a DSP system has been investigated. A novel analysis and model of a self-excited induction generator that takes iron loss into account is presented in a simplified and understandable way. The use of the variation in magnetising inductance with voltage leads to an accurate prediction of whether or not self-excitation will occur in a SEIG for various capacitance values and speeds in both the loaded and unloaded cases. The characteristics of magnetising inductance, Lm, with respect to the rms induced stator voltage or <b>magnetising</b> <b>current</b> determines the regions of stable operation as well as the minimum generated voltage without loss of self-excitation. In the SEIG, the frequency of the generated voltage depends on the speed of the prime mover as well as the condition of the load. With the speed of the prime mover of an isolated SEIG constant, an increased load causes the magnitude of the generated voltage and frequency to decrease. This is due to a drop in the speed of the rotating magnetic field. When the speed of the prime mover drops with load then the decrease in voltage and frequency will be greater than for the case where the speed is held constant. Dynamic simulation studies shows that increasing the capacitance value can compensate for the voltage drop due to loading, but the drop in frequency can be compensated only by increasing the speed of the rotor. In vector control of the SEIG, the reference flux linkage varies according to the variation in rotor speed. The problems associated with the estimation of stator flux linkage using integration are investigated and an improved estimation of flux linkage is developed that compensates for the integration error. Analysis of the three-axes to two-axes transformation and its application in the measurement of rms current, rms voltage, active power and power factor from data obtained in only one set of measurements taken at a single instant of time is discussed. It is also shown that from measurements taken at two consecutive instants in time the frequency of the three-phase AC power supply can be evaluated. The three-axes to twoaxes transformation tool simplifies the calculation of the electrical quantities...|$|E
