40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a {{theoretical}} framework grounded in the literature, which can be used to explore the influence of big data on business-IT alignment in the healthcare context. Increasingly the availability of information systems in healthcare delivery and service management results in massive amounts of complex data that have the 3 V characteristics of big data (i. e. volume, variety, velocity). Use of big-healthcare-data has been identified as bringing significant benefits to the healthcare sector from improved decision making through to population health analysis. Although the technical dynamics around big data such as analytics and infrastructure requirements are extensively researched, less attention has been given to social dynamics such as peoples’ experience, understanding and perceived usefulness of this data. To address this gap, the paper uses social representation theory as a methodological lens to develop a theoretical framework to study the social dynamics around big data and its use in the healthcare context. The selected case for this development is the New Zealand healthcare sector and an approach using <b>multi-level</b> <b>macro,</b> meso, and micro analysis is taken. Use of social representation theory as a methodological lens to develop a theoretical framework is a novel approach. Such a theoretical framework will be useful as a foundation for carrying out on-going empirical research on big data to understand its influence on business-IT alignment in the healthcare context...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{more than}} 150 Canadians {{have joined the}} Islamic State (IS) in the Middle East, causing alarm among both Canadian policy makers and the general citizenry. One of the most salient {{questions}} related to this development pertains to the factors that drove these young people to extremism. Most experts posit that extremism is caused by multiple factors embedded in our social, economic, geopolitical, and cultural processes. However, evidence to support such claims is still poor as limited primary {{research has been done}} in Canada to understand, explain, and identify radicalism’s causes, its main drivers, and its global-local linkages. Due to their emphasis on policy and federal law enforcement, studies of radicalism in Canada have proven inadequate in outlining a comprehensive understanding of the psycho-social conditions that might be associated with the radicalization process. Considering the above gaps, this research draws upon three studies in order to map the perceptions of the leadership of Islamic community-based organizations and university-based student organizations with regards to issues related to social conflict, terrorism, and counter-terrorism in Canada. The objective {{of this study is to}} both document the existence of radicalism and to determine the role of critical social issues that may potentially contribute to this phenomenon. In addition, this paper will hopefully elaborate on the results of a <b>multi-level</b> (<b>macro,</b> meso, and micro) analysis of the social factors which act as key drivers of radicalism through the use of qualitative methods and the aid of social conflict and social-psychological theoretical lenses. Finally, the study concludes by exploring the Canadian national counter-terrorism (CT) strategy’s effectiveness in countering radicalization...|$|E
40|$|Background: {{although}} there is a wealth of information available about quality improvement tools and techniques in healthcare there is little understanding about overcoming the challenges of day-to-day implementation in complex organisations like hospitals. The 'Quality and Safety in Europe by Research' (QUASER) study will investigate how hospitals implement, spread and sustain quality improvement, including the difficulties they face and how they overcome them. The overall aim of the study is to explore relationships between the organisational and cultural characteristics of hospitals and how these impact on the quality of health care; the findings will be designed to help policy makers, payers and hospital managers understand the factors and processes that enable hospitals in Europe to achieve-and sustain-high quality services for their patients. Methods/design. in-depth <b>multi-level</b> (<b>macro,</b> meso and micro-system) analysis of healthcare quality policies and practices in 5 European countries, including longitudinal case studies in a purposive sample of 10 hospitals. The project design has three major features:. a working definition of quality comprising three components: clinical effectiveness, patient safety and patient experience. a conceptualisation of quality as a human, social, technical and organisational accomplishment. an emphasis on translational research that is evidence-based and seeks to provide strategic and practical guidance for hospital practitioners and health care policy makers in the European Union. Throughout the study we will adopt a mixed methods approach, including qualitative (in-depth, narrative-based, ethnographic case studies using interviews, and direct non-participant observation of organisational processes) and quantitative research (secondary analysis of safety and quality data, for example: adverse incident reporting; patient complaints and claims). Discussion. the protocol is {{based on the premise that}} future research, policy and practice need to address the sociology of improvement in equal measure to the science and technique of improvement, or at least expand the discipline of improvement to include these critical organisational and cultural processes. We define the 'organisational and cultural characteristics associated with better quality of care' in a broad sense that encompasses all the features of a hospital that might be hypothesised to impact upon clinical effectiveness, patient safety and/or patient experience...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviewed}} relevant {{literature of}} using hand-held devices {{in children and}} used responses from an online discussion forum to investigate people’s opinions towards the use of mobile hand-held devices for children under 12 years old. Critical discourse analysis (CDA) was used as analysis methods in three-dimension framework via micro, meso and <b>macro</b> <b>multi-level</b> interpretations. Although all the 125 online responses emphasised that children should not overuse technologies, and children should be exposed to technologies as well as no technology time, they were divided into anti-technology responses and technology-favouriteresponses. The argument concerns around child development were discussed among the 125 online responses. Educators and parents, {{who are interested in}} the areas of whether or not young children should be exposed to and use hand-held devices, will find this paper interesting and useful...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reviewed}} {{the literature on}} parental rearing styles and used responses from an online discussion forum to investigate people’s opinions towards parental rearing styles and strategies when children use hand-held devices. Critical discourse analysis (CDA) {{was used as an}} analysis method via micro, meso and <b>macro</b> <b>multi-level</b> interpretations. The majority of online responses agree that parents’ positive engagement using an authoritative rearing style {{play an important role in}} children’s use of hand-held devices, while authoritarian, permissive and uninvolved rearing styles hindered children’s development. Five positive parenting strategies were promoted by online responses, which included accepting technology, managing the use of technology, being responsible for children’s technology choice, setting playing time, and encouraging children to have no-technology time. Educators and parents who are interested in using hand-held devices with children will find this article useful in understanding positive strategies to implement when children use these devices...|$|R
