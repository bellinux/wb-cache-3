No incompatibility was observed between the fertilizers and the Admire and Platinum mixtures applied at planting and side dress, and both insecticides provided comparable control of whitefly populations regardless of fertilizer used. However, based on our experience in 2001, we suggest that growers use a dilute mixture with the final applied volume to avoid any potential "clumping" problems in the <b>mix</b> <b>tank.</b> In some cases the addition of the DuneUp® starter fertilizer appeared to improve plant growth, but was probably more due to the unique mixture of NPK rather than the combination with the insecticides.

40|$|Standard {{plate count}} (SPC) {{bacteria}} were isolated from a drinking-water treatment facility {{and from the}} river supplying the facility. All isolates were identified and tested for their resistance to six antibiotics to determine if drug-resistant bacteria were selected for {{as a consequence of}} water treatment. Among the isolates surviving our test procedures, there was a significant selection (P less than 0. 05) of gram-negative SPC organisms resistant to two or more of the test antibiotics. These bacteria were isolated from the flash <b>mix</b> <b>tank,</b> where chlorine, alum, and lime are added to the water. Streptomycin resistance in particular was more frequent in this population as compared with bacteria in the untreated river water (P less than 0. 01). SPC bacteria from the clear well, which is a tank holding the finished drinking water at the treatment facility, were also more frequently antibiotic resistant than were the respective river water populations. When 15. 8 and 18. 2 % of the river water bacteria were multiply antibiotic resistant, 57. 1 and 43. 5 %, respectively, of the SPC bacteria in the clear well were multiply antibiotic resistant. Selection for bacteria exhibiting resistance to streptomycin was achieved by chlorinating river water in the laboratory.

Four composite digesters (two insulated and two uninsulated) were buried underground to measure their internal temperature (°C) {{at a depth of}} 140 cm and 180 cm, biogas production and methane (CH 4) concentration in biogas from August to February. In parallel the temperature of the air (100 cm above ground), in the slurry <b>mixing</b> <b>tank</b> and in the soil (10, 100, 140, and 180 cm depth) was measured by thermocouple.

The comparison was done both in replicated tanks (separate rearing) and in <b>mixed</b> <b>tanks</b> (<b>mixed</b> rearing) where sire origins were recovered by genotyping of eight microsatellite markers. Weight, length and growth rate were measured from day 238 post-fertilization (69 g mean weight) to day 611 post-fertilization (390 g mean weight). Both in <b>mixed</b> and separate <b>tanks,</b> both selected groups (P, M) were larger than unselected groups (W, D). No difference was seen at any time between W and D, nor between M and P.

30|$|Evaluating and mapping {{feed water}} for solar thermal {{desalination}} plants indicate that water samples in El Gebail have excess salts for major wells and {{cannot be used}} for drinking without desalination. Also the water samples have {{a significant amount of}} calcium sulphate and small amount of calcium carbonate. Using PHREEQC to simulate feed water evaporation with continuous water feeding allows quantification of changes in solution composition during pure water recovery and allows simulation of the effects of these changes on precipitation of subsequent scale-forming solids. The resulting simulated saturation indices values could be used to quantitatively assess the potential of a given feed water to form scale or to compare the possibility of a number of feed waters to form scale during solar desalination. Simulated model of feed waters cannot perfectly predict the surroundings under which scale will form due to the effects of potentially stable supersaturated solutions, solution velocity, and residence time inside the <b>mix</b> <b>tank</b> of the desalination systems. However, the simulated scale-forming potential of planned feed waters could be compared with the actual scale-forming properties of feed waters, as operational histories in desalination systems are already known. This may provide a technique to estimate the actual performance of proposed feed waters under optimum set of conditions. The experimental data could validate the technique described in this study as a regular method for assessing the suitability of intended feed waters for solar thermal desalination. The tests carried out to assess the effect of water salinity on scale formation morphology confirm that nucleation and crystalline growth increase with increase in the percentage of pure water recovery.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Previous {{studies of}} six Oregon {{public water supply}} systems {{revealed}} that greater proportions of the standard plate count (SPC) bacteria from distribution waters were multiple antibiotic resistant (MAR) compared to isolates from the corresponding source raw waters. In the present study, two of these water systems were examined further to determine the possible role that metal tolerance has {{in the selection of}} MAR bacteria. The first drinking water system examined serves an Oregon coastal resort community. A total of 216 distribution water and 177 raw water isolates were tested for resistance to five antibiotics (chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfanilamide, and tetracycline), tolerance to six metals (as salts, Al₂(SO₄) ₃, CdC 1 ₂, CuC 1 ₂, Pb(NO₃) ₂, SnC 1 ₂, and ZnC 1 ₂), and were identified. Statistically significant associations between multiple antibiotic resistance and tolerance to Cu²⁺, Pb²⁺, and Zn ²⁺ were found among distribution water isolates but not raw water isolates. Significantly greater proportions of the raw water isolates were tolerant to A 1 ³⁺ and Sn²⁺ and were not typically MAR. Tolerance to Cd²⁺ was not associated with the isolates from either water type or with multiple antibiotic resistance. Characteristic patterns of antibiotic resistance and metal tolerance were associated with various taxonomic genera and groups. Of the taxonomic types that were isolated from both raw and distribution waters, greater proportions of the distribution water isolates were resistant to more antibiotics and tolerant to more metals. Resistance to kanamycin and tolerance to Cu²⁺, Pb²⁺, and Zn²⁺ was typical among the distribution but not raw water Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, and Pseudomonas and Alcaligenes groups. The association of multiple antibiotic resistance with tolerance to Cu²⁺, Pb²⁺, and Zn²⁺ was significantly more prevalent among the isolates from {{near the end of the}} distribution system while the isolates from near the origin of the system typically expressed phenotypes more similar to those of the raw water isolates. To determine the impact of water treatment and distribution in the selection of MAR and MMT (multiple metal tolerant) SPC bacteria, a drinking water system serving an Oregon community of 40, 000 was studied. On four dates, samples were obtained from the source water, treatment waters, distribution waters, and inner surfaces of water pipes. A total of 730 river, 290 flash <b>mix</b> <b>tank,</b> 359 clear well, 629 distribution water, and 298 pipe surface isolates were identified and tested for resistance to the isolates. Significantly greater proportions of the raw water isolates were tolerant to A 1 ³⁺ and Sn²⁺ and were not typically MAR. Tolerance to Cd²⁺ was not associated with the isolates from either water type or with multiple antibiotic resistance. Characteristic patterns of antibiotic resistance and metal tolerance were associated with various taxonomic genera and groups.

Results indicated increases in the incidence of MAR and MMT bacteria when comparing river, treatment plant, and distribution water and pipe surface SPC populations. Distribution water isolates and isolates from inner pipe surfaces exhibited much greater associations of metal tolerance with multiple antibiotic resistance as compared to river isolates or treatment plant isolates. Pipe surface materials were shown to contain high concentrations of metals and large numbers of viable bacteria. The predominant metal tolerance phenotypes of these organisms reflected the metals present, since the copper pipe sample had a high level of Cu²⁺ tolerant bacteria while the galvanized iron pipe samples contained many Zn²⁺ tolerant bacteria. Similarities in taxonomic groups as well as in antibiotic and metal resistance patterns were observed in distribution water isolates and in bacteria from inner pipe surfaces. This suggested that bacteria colonizing pipe surfaces are shed into flowing distribution water...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} River Protection Project at Hanford, Washington, Bechtel National, Inc. {{has been}} {{contracted}} by the United States Department of Energy to design a Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant to stabilize liquid radioactive waste. Because of its experience with radioactive waste stabilization, the Savannah River Technology Center of the Westinghouse Savannah River Company is working with Bechtel National and Washington Group International, to help design and test {{certain parts of the}} Waste Treatment Plant. One part of the process is the separation of radioactive isotopes from the liquid waste by a precipitation reaction and cross-flow ultrafiltration. To better understand those combined processes an experiment was performed using a simulated radioactive waste, made to prototypically represent the chemical and physical characteristics of a Hanford waste in tank 241 -AN- 102 and precipitated under prototypic conditions. The resultant slurry was then filtered using a cross-flow filter prototypic in porosity, length, and diameter to the plant design. An important aspect of filtration for waste treatment is the rate at which permeate is produced. There are many factors that affect filtration rate {{and one of the most}} difficult to obtain is the effect of particles in the waste streams. The Waste Treatment Plant will filter many waste streams, with varying concentrations and types of dissolved and undissolved solids. An added complication is the need to precipitate organic complexants so they can be efficiently separated from the supernatant. Depending on how precipitation is performed, the newly created solids will add to the complicating factors that determine permeate flux rate. To investigate the effect of precipitated solids on filter flux a pilot-scale test was performed and two different mixing mechanisms were used for the precipitation reaction. A standard impeller type mixer, which created a homogeneous mixture, and a pulse jet mixer, which created a ''less than'' homogeneous precipitation environment. Pulse jet mixers are included in the design of the Waste Treatment Plant because they have no moving parts, which is advantageous for radioactive operations as no maintenance is required. A pulse jet mixer uses alternate pulses of pressurized air and vacuum to <b>mix</b> <b>tank</b> contents. This pulse jet mixer was not expected to establish a homogeneous mixture throughout the test tank, therefore, it was important to know its effect on filtration after a waste is precipitated. This paper discusses the experimental results of cross-flow filter flux after a simulated waste is precipitated under each of the two mixing methods. The main conclusion reached is that while the ''less than well mixed'' jet-pulsed waste gave a lower average filter flux it may still be sufficiently large enough to meet plant requirements...|$|E

The main objective {{of this research is}} to gain a thorough understanding of these process vessels via research and to provide recommendations to improve their performance. Reactors and <b>mixing</b> <b>tanks</b> were chosen as the test unit operations because although they contribute significantly to the manufacturing process, reactors have frequently been poorly understood {{or in the case of}} <b>mixing</b> <b>tanks,</b> taken for granted. Consequently, there is a lack of comprehensive knowledge to support successful operations of these process vessels. In addition, this research also recommends using photocatalysis technology to destroy liquid wastes produced from such manufacturing activities. For each product, a full characterisation was provided that included detailed theoretical analyses that presents a unique insight into the hydrodynamics occurring in these process vessels. The credibility of theoretical predictions was demonstrated via qualitative and quantitative validation using particle image velocimetry. Results from characterisation showed that the reactors and <b>mixing</b> <b>tanks</b> employed in the manufacture of military propellants, high explosives or aerial bombs were operating at sub-optimum conditions.

40|$|During disinfection, humic {{substances}} undergo oxidation and substitution reactions with chlorine {{and form}} trihalomethanes (THMs). Thus, humic substances, which mainly consist of humic and fulvic acids, are considered THM precursors. THMs are carcinogens, {{and a maximum}} contaminant level of 100 μg/l of such compounds in drinking waters was established by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Many studies were conducted to examine the removal of humic substances by alum. Alum hydrolysis products undergo adsorption and charge neutralization with the functional groups of humic molecules (mainly phenolic and carboxyl functional groups). Evidence of surface complexation between alum hydrolysis products and such functional groups has been provided. Reported data also indicate that optimum alum coagulation occurs in the pH range of 5 - 6, and that the large molecular weight (MW) fractions are better removed by alum than the small MW fractions. However, the mechanism of alum coagulation of humic substances is not conclusively established. A pilot-plant of orthokinetic flocculation followed by filtration was studied to examine the removal mechanism of THM formation potential (THMFP) by alum, using humic acid as the THM precursor. Orthokinetic flocculation and clarification are accomplished in an up-flow filter of buoyant plastic medium. Alum was dosed to a rapid <b>mix</b> <b>tank</b> prior to the flocculation process. The THMFP test is complex. The correlations between THMFP and color, UV absorbance, and bromoform formation potential (BFP) were evaluated. Only BFP {{can be used as}} a surrogate measurement for THMFP with a correlation factor of 0. 944. Five variables: alum treatment mechanism (adsorption and sweep), flowrate, humic acid concentration, addition of kaolin, and addition of powdered activated carbon (PAC) were studied using two-level fractional factorial design. The design gives unconfounded main effects and second-order interactions. The following main effects and second-order interactions were found significant on the removal of THMFP: (1) alum treatment, PAC addition, humic acid concentration, and flowrate main effects, and (2) flowrate/PAC, humic acid concentration/PAC, alum treatment/PAC, alum treatment/flowrate, and humic acid concentration/kaolin second-order interactions. Evaluation of the main effects and interactions indicated that higher removal of THMFP can be achieved using adsorption alum treatment, PAC, and low flowrate. The effect of kaolin was inconclusive. Temperature between 4 - 15 ∘C did not affect THMFP removal. The higher THMFP removal during adsorption alum coagulation resulted from the removal of small MW fractions of humic acid. The removal of these fractions is believed due to chelation interactions with aluminum hydroxide polymers which are present under optimum conditions of alum adsorption coagulation. Rapid mixing and orthokinetic flocculation implemented during this work provided adequate physical transport for the chelation interactions to occur...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{phosphorus}} (P) removal {{is generally}} considered to be necessary when attempting to achieve ultra low P concentrations (i. e. < 50 μg/L) in wastewater treatment. However, the impact of aging of chemical solids (i. e. hydrous ferric oxides (HFO)) and thereby solids residence times (SRT) typical of conventional wastewater treatment processes on P removal is not well understood. This study characterized the uptake of P in co-precipitation systems under varying influent P concentrations and methods of P addition (i. e. steady state versus transient dosing); identified the impact of SRT on P removal, HFO floc structure, equilibrium adsorption of P to HFO and on the dynamics of P removal under steady state and transient conditions; and described the dynamic behaviour of P sorption onto HFO floc by the development of a model. The study employed lab scale continuous flow sequencing batch reactor (SBR) pilots that received the discharge of a flash <b>mix</b> <b>tank.</b> The pilots were fed with a synthetic natural water and operated over a range of SRTs (i. e. 2. 8 - 26. 6 days). Operation at different influent P concentrations and methods of P addition (i. e. steady state vs. transient dosing) was evaluated. Batch sorption testing with solids from the SBRs was also conducted. Under steady state operating conditions the majority of P removal occurred in the flash tank (94 % with 3. 4 mg influent P/L; 83 % with 6. 4 mg influent P/L) with an additional smaller fraction of removal in the SBRs (additional 3. 3 – 4. 8 % removal with 3. 4 mg influent P/L; 5. 5 - 8. 8 % with 6. 4 mg influent P/L). Soluble P uptake was higher at SRTs ≤ 7. 4 days with 3. 4 mg influent P/L and SRTs ≤ 14. 3 days with 6. 4 mg influent P/L. The floc morphology (i. e. open vs. compact floc structure) in the flash solids was found to be {{different from that of the}} SBR aged solids using SEM analysis. Particle size distributions were found to be the same in all systems supporting the hypothesis that changes in floc morphology were more responsible for differences in P removal than floc size. Batch sorption studies indicated that fresh HFO had a higher sorption capacity in comparison to aged (2. 8, 7. 4, 10. 8 and 22. 8 day) HFO. P desorption from HFO solids was found to be negligible supporting chemisorption as the mechanism of P adsorption. P adsorption onto HFO solids was determined to be best described by the Freundlich isotherm. An equilibrium model was found to adequately describe P adsorption onto HFO solids of different ages. Modelling showed that fresh HFO contributed more to P sorption than aged HFO in each SBR implying that the fresh flash solids were more responsible for the observed P uptake in the SBRs in comparison to the aged SBR solids. Transient studies showed that P removal in the SBRs and batch sorption tests was characterized by an initial fast period of removal followed by a period of slower removal until pseudo-equilibrium was reached. A model was developed to describe the dynamic behaviour of P sorption onto three different solid types (i. e. steady state dosed SBR solids, transient dosed SBR solids, and preformed batch solids). Overall, the calibrated model was found to provide a good description of P removal in the SBRs and batch testing. The model was able to reflect the different process conditions (i. e. mixing) in experiments conducted in the SBRs and the batch tests. This was reflected in the estimated values of the rate coefficients obtained from the batch tests and the SBRs. It was found that the same rate coefficient could be used to describe P adsorption onto HFO floc of different ages (i. e. 2. 8 - 26. 6 days) ...|$|E

Experimental results demonstrate the design, fabrication, and testing results of the self-vortical micromixer integrated with the micro-DMFC, showing that the self-vortical micromixer has high fluidic mixing performance and can be oper-ated in the micro-DMFC as a methanol-water <b>mixing</b> <b>tank</b> for water management of the micro-DMFC. The power performance testing results demonstrate that the single cell of micro-DMFC, with the included self-vortical micromixer, exhibits a maximum power density of 21. 27 mW/cm...|$|R

40|$|Based on the <b>mixing</b> <b>tank</b> and tube {{models for}} drug absorption, the {{apparent}} absorption rate constant {{is shown to}} be related to the fraction of dose absorbed as a function of the volume/flow ratio of GI fluids. This analysis applies to drugs that are absorbed according to first-order kinetics, without limitation by dissolution rate, lumenal decomposition, or first-pass metabolism. Analysis of pharmacokinetic data of drugs that fit these criteria and are absorbed to varying extents enabled the estimation of the volume/flow ratio of GI fluids in humans; it was found to be 1. 6 ± 0. 3 (SE) hr using a <b>mixing</b> <b>tank</b> model and 0. 32 ± 0. 05 hr using a tube model. These findings are discussed with respect to volume and flow parameters used in the design of various types of drug absorption studies...|$|R

Present work experimentally investigates the effect of impeller submergence depths on oxygen transfer and corresponding power consumption. It {{has been found that}} at higher range of impeller submergence, <b>mixing</b> <b>tanks</b> consume less power and gives higher values of oxygen transfer coefficient. Optimal range of submergence depth is 0. 7 to 0. 9 times the impeller diameter. Copyright © 2011 BCREC UNDIP. All rights reserved.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} applying advanced control design strategies to the <b>mixing</b> <b>tank</b> process of the plant of Falconbridge Ltd. in Sudbury, Ontario. The <b>mixing</b> <b>tank</b> receives Strathcona slurry, Strathcona filter cakes, dry Raglan powder and water as its inputs. Our objective is to control the Raglan to Strathcona ratio, the <b>mixing</b> <b>tank</b> level and the pulp density of the output mixed slurry to their respective set points so {{that the effects of}} all model uncertainties could be reduced. Static optimization is first carried out to investigate the solution set of the existing process. Then linearization and analysis of the existing system at its equilibrium point are performed. Hereinafter, besides the existing Repulper tank process, a new Three-Phase alternative process is suggested so that all uncertainties can be handled properly. Different controllers are then designed to determine if they are able to perform satisfactorily while undertaking all the uncertainties. Nonlinear controllers of "Input-Output linearization" and switching control, which is a variant of sliding control, are used. Robust switching control is found to have the robust capability with guaranteed robust performance and stability for system that has linear parametric bounded uncertainties and has a diagonal or triangular g matrix, the matrix that maps from the state equations' inputs to the state equations' differentials. Linear MIMO controllers of state feedback pole placement and H 2 optimal control are used. Comparison of performance and robustness is made among different nonlinear and linear controllers...|$|R

40|$|A {{computational}} {{technique has}} been developed to study the fluid motion in a baffled and unbaffled <b>mixing</b> <b>tank.</b> This technique was devised for a cylindrical <b>mixing</b> <b>tank</b> using a Computational Fluid Dynamics code, FIDAP. Two model analyses are presented in this thesis: Unbaffled tank steady state analysis. Baffled tank transient state analysis. The method presented in this thesis uses subroutines incorporated into the CFD program to impose the boundary conditions associated with each baffle in the tank. These boundary conditions are rebuilt for each time step to capture {{the effects of the}} relative motion between the baffles and the impeller. In addition, the use of parameters in defining the coordinates of the geometry, the density of the mesh, and the fluid properties allow a straightforward automation of the model. This automation considerably reduces the time to create a new tank geometry from scratch. Furthermore, the automation permits rapid model development to be used in selecting optimal tanks and radial impeller combinations...|$|R
