25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E

500|$|Larter took on {{the title}} role in Marigold (2007), {{alongside}} Salman Khan. The film was released in August 2007 and revolved around an American actress (Larter) who goes to India and gets {{caught up in the}} exotic world of Bollywood. Filming took place in North India and London, commencing in June 2004. In an interview with the BBC, Larter remarked this role was [...] "an opportunity to overcome <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> of singing and dancing because I have no professional training [...] I really focused on the character and loved this journey she went on and the experiences she had." [...] She was paid a seven-figure salary for her part in the film.|$|E
500|$|The {{farm and}} lake scenes were filmed in Campbell River and Okanagan Lake respectively, {{though it is}} {{depicted}} in Greenwood Lake, New York. [...] "We shot part {{of it at the}} lake where it was 37° cold, which is beyond an ice cream headache. And the second stuff we shot in a big huge tank where we filmed all the underwater sequence, that was in a 93° pool," [...] Landes clarified. Cook and Landes performed their own stunts in both sequences. [...] "My biggest fear is being trapped in a car underwater. So it was kind of cool to face <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> and all that," [...] Cook divulged. [...] "We took a couple of lessons with a scuba guide to be comfortable being underwater and breathing off the regulator," [...] Landes enunciated.|$|E
500|$|Two {{series of}} {{companion}} novels were {{issued by the}} publishers. [...] The first series, Galaxy Science Fiction Novels, began in 1950 with Eric Frank Russell's Sinister Barrier; seven titles were released by World Editions, and a further twenty-eight by Guinn's Galaxy Publishing Corporation. [...] The books were initially in digest format but this was changed to a standard paperback format {{for the last four}} titles. In 1959 the line was sold to Beacon Books, which produced another 11 volumes. Beacon specialized in softcore pornography, and changed the titles of most of the books they published to be more suggestive. [...] The last title, Sin in Space (originally Outpost Mars), by Cyril Judd (a pseudonym for Cyril Kornbluth and Judith Merril) appeared in 1961. Two years later a second series, Galaxy Magabooks, appeared; each of these consisted of two short novels, both by the same author, published in a single volume. Only three were released; the last, And <b>My</b> <b>Fear</b> Is Great/Baby Is Three by Theodore Sturgeon, appeared in 1964.|$|E

500|$|Lady Gaga {{collaborated with}} RedOne and Space Cowboy {{in writing and}} {{producing}} [...] "So Happy I Could Die". All {{three of them were}} the main instrumentalists behind the song and recorded it at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. Other personnel who worked on the song includes Johny Severin for vocal editing and audio engineering, Dave Russell for audio engineering and Mike Orton for mixing the song at Sarm West Studios. An occasional drinker, the song represents Gaga's fear of what she describes as the [...] "Alcohol Monster", as evident of several lyrics in the song, such as the chorus; [...] "Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine, stars in our eyes and we're having a good time." [...] In an interview with MTV, Gaga professed that the song is about the euphoric effects of alcohol—the so-called [...] "happy place"—and explained that her fear is split between two songs. [...] "My fear of alcohol. <b>My</b> <b>fear</b> of drugs... fear of addiction. [...] But alcohol is funny because it takes you down to this very happy place and just like forgetting all your problems and for just a minute you're so happy, {{and then all of a}} sudden, [...] stomach turns and go way down... And that's my relationship with consumption and abuse." [...] Other meaning behind the song was given by a writer for Elle magazine, which described it as [...] "about masturbating while thinking about a woman". The singer also acknowledged on her Twitter account that while writing the song she was inspired by English singer Lily Allen.|$|E

2500|$|The route {{includes}} unstable {{areas such}} as Trebanos, liable to landslide and earthquake due to extensive historic mineworkings, which are deemed too dangerous for mains gas to be piped to local homes. Local people raised concerns and permission was denied in November 2006, but the pipeline was still laid in the area. As one local said: [...] "If there was a shift or a landslip again, <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> is that the pipe would fracture, and we'd get an enormous gas leak." [...] National Grid claimed that the pipeline would be secure. An undiscovered Roman road was found during {{the building of the}} pipeline near Brecon and was partially destroyed as a result.|$|E

2500|$|Therefore, {{a family}} meeting took place {{to talk about}} the boy's future: None of his sisters-in-law was ready to finance his studies. As for his brothers, they {{considered}} him unsuccessful and considered to find him a job as a farmer or grocer's apprentice. Only his brother Mahmoud, who was a thirty years old single and worker at the ministry of Justice, decided to invest in his brother's education. Thanks to his support and aid, Bourguiba enrolled in Lycée Carnot of Tunis. Bourguiba stated in 1973 the reasons his brother supported him: [...] "As for [...] "si" [...] Mahmoud, I had forgotten {{to tell you that the}} year I passed my certificat d'études primaires and lost my mother, he had just left Sadiki where he was an intern. He was in classe de seconde. I lived, myself in Tourbet El Bey. Every Friday and Sunday of every week, he came home to teach me. But he used, during his task, an unpreceeded brutality and savagery. He was in such a furry that he beat me like plaster. I was still not ten and <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> was so intense that I could not even focus or understand tasks that he asked me. Each time, panicked, the cleaning woman rushed to the window and cried for help. I was severely traumatized and I still wonder today how such a scandalous treatment has not finally overcame my intelligence and thirst for knowledge [...] He had indeed redeemed himself".|$|E
2500|$|Frontman James Veck-Gilodi {{has spoken}} {{at length about}} the themes of each song on the album, {{describing}} them as 'very personal and each is a small story that depicts {{a part of my}} life'. Much of the album is about nostalgia, underachievement and anxiety, which are all topics which are personal to him as he wrote all the lyrics for the album. The opening track [...] "The Past Six Years", from whose lyrics the album takes its title, is described as 'an ode to... not really achieving as much as we'd have liked'. The lyrics make reference to friends and fellow bands Lower Than Atlantis and Young Guns and how James feels 'a perpetual bitterness and jealousy towards them in terms of their achievements, {{despite the fact that they}} are close friends'. [...] "I'm a Bore, Mostly" [...] also deals with the topic of underachievement, with James explaining that the song is about 'the mundane daily routine I had when I was living in London. ...I couldn't deal with city life, I rarely left the house and found myself sinking into this terrible routine. I didn't really appreciate anything at the time and I had no enthusiasm'. He has claimed he wrote the song [...] "Filthy Rotten Scoundrel" [...] about himself; 'I need to learn to be grateful and appreciate the opportunities that I have been given. It's also about <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> of living, dying and never really achieving anything'. [...] "The World or Nothing" [...] continues this trend, with James describing the theme as 'the vicious cycle of feeling lost and resorting to the aid of alcohol while also feeling lost because of alcohol. It talks about how self-destructive a lot of us are and how we enjoy abusing our bodies'. Of [...] "Nelson's County", Veck-Gilodi has said: 'This song is about the county of Norfolk and how a lot of the people who reside there seem to have no real ambition other than working a 9-5, raising a family and living a normal life'.|$|E
