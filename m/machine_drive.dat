40|$|Background: Since the {{introduction}} of full field digital mammography (FFDM) {{a large number of}} UK breast cancer screening centers have reported blurred images, which can be caused by movement at the compression paddle during image acquisition. Purpose: To propose and investigate the use of position feedback from the breast side of the compression paddle to reduce the settling time of breast side motion. Method: Movement at the breast side of the paddle was measured using two calibrated linear potentiometers. A mathematical model for the compression paddle, <b>machine</b> <b>drive</b> and breast was developed using the paddle movement data. Simulation software was used to optimize the position feedback controller parameters for different <b>machine</b> <b>drive</b> time constants and simulate the potential performance of the proposed system. Results: The results obtained are based on simulation alone and indicate that closed-loop control of breast side paddle position dramatically reduced the settling time from over 90 seconds to less than 4 seconds. The effect of different <b>machine</b> <b>drive</b> time constants on the open-loop response is insignificant. With closed-loop control, the larger the time constant the longer the time required for the breast side motion to settle. Conclusions: Paddle motion induced blur could be significantly reduced by implementing the proposed closed-loop control...|$|E

An experimental research {{study was conducted to}} examine the type of data that is recorded by CCC equipment during road sub-base compaction of “select fill” granular materials using a smooth-drum vibratory roller. A prototype roller was utilized that allowed for simultaneous real-time <b>machine</b> <b>drive</b> power and compactometer measurements, which permitted independent and simultaneous evaluation of the degree of compaction of the soil. The behavior of the recorded <b>machine</b> <b>drive</b> power and compactometer values for different lifts and with increasing compactive effort for a single lift is presented and discussed. The statistical nature of the recorded CCC data sets is explored in detail, with a focus on distribution fitting assessment techniques that are applicable for CCC data. Comparisons are also made between the simultaneously recorded <b>machine</b> <b>drive</b> power and compactometer measurements. The results and associated discussion that are presented are useful for understanding the variable nature of CCC data sets, and the observations that are made have practical implications for the creation of CCC construction specifications that are to be used to control the compaction process.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} the principle, basic torque theory and design {{optimisation}} of a six-phase reluctance dc machine are considered. A trapezoidal phase current waveform for the <b>machine</b> <b>drive</b> is proposed and evaluated to minimise ripple torque. Low cost normal laminated salient-pole rotors {{with and without}} slits and chamfered poles are investigated. The six-phase machine is optimised in multi-dimensions by linking the finite-element analysis method directly with an optimisation algorithm; the objective function is to maximise the torque per copper losses of the machine. The armature reaction effect is investigated in detail and found to be severe. The measured and calculated torque performances of a 35 kW optimum designed six-phase reluctance dc <b>machine</b> <b>drive</b> are presented.

40|$|Due to the {{potential}} benefits resulting {{from the use of}} a phase order higher than three in transmission, some interest has also grown in the area of multi-phase machine. For <b>machine</b> <b>drive</b> applications, multi-phase system could potentially meet the demand for high power electric drive systems, which are both rugged and energy-efficient. High phase number drives possess several advantages over conventional three-phase drives such as: reducing the amplitude and increasing the frequency of torque pulsation, reducing the rotor harmonic currents, reducing the current per phase without increasing the voltage per phase, lowering the dc link current harmonics, higher reliability and increased power in the same frame. The high phase order drive is likely to remain limited to specialized applications where high reliability is demanded such as electric/hybrid vehicles, aerospace applications, ship propulsion, and high power application where a combination of several solid state devices form one leg of the drive. The research has been underway for the last two decades to investigate the various issues related to the use of multi-phase machine as a potential alternative to the conventional three-phase machine. This paper, therefore, reviews the progress made in multi-phase induction <b>machine</b> <b>drive</b> research and development since its inception. Attempts are made to highlight the current and future issues involved for the development of multi-phase induction <b>machine</b> <b>drive</b> technology for future application. © 2002 Elsevie...|$|E

40|$|A {{switched}} reluctance (SR) <b>machine</b> <b>drive</b> {{has many}} advantages over other competing drive technologies {{in terms of}} reliability and fault tolerance, which make it particularly attractive for safety critical applications in more electric aircraft technologies. However, an SR <b>machine</b> <b>drive</b> requires a large DC-link capacitor to buffer the de-fluxing magnetic energy during a phase commutation period and to filter out AC harmonic currents from contaminating the DC supply. This study describes a switching technique for minimisation of the DC-link capacitance in SR machine drives and presents experimental results from a laboratory demonstrator. The proposed switching method aims to maintain a constant average DC-link current over a switching cycle, thus eliminating commutation-induced lowfrequency current harmonics. Consequently, the DC-link capacitance can be minimised. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is assessed through filter design and demonstrated by experiments with a dSPACE control platform...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the optimum {{design of a}} permanent-magnet-assisted reluctance rotor of a 110 kW reluctance synchronous traction machine. Previous {{studies show that the}} performance of the pure reluctance synchronous <b>machine</b> <b>drive</b> deteriorates fast in the flux-weakening speed region. To address this problem, thin bonded permanent-magnet sheet material is used inside the flux barriers of the reluctance rotor to improve the performance of the drive, especially in the flux-weakening speed region. A design optimization algorithm is implemented to minimize the volume and hence the cost of the permanent-magnet material, subject to voltage and torque constraints. The calculated and measured results show clearly that the performance of the reluctance synchronous traction machine with a minimum amount of permanent-magnet material in the rotor compares favorably with the performance of the conventional induction <b>machine</b> <b>drive</b> at both rated and maximum speeds.
