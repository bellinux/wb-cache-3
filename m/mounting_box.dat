5000|$|A pattress or pattress box is the {{container}} {{for the space}} behind electrical fittings such as power outlet sockets and light switches. Pattresses may be designed for either surface mounting (with cabling running along the wall surface) or for embedding in the wall or skirting board. Some electricians use the term [...] "pattress box" [...] to describe a surface-mounted box, although simply the term [...] "pattress" [...] suffices. The term [...] "flush box" [...] is used for a <b>mounting</b> <b>box</b> that goes inside the wall, although some use the term [...] "wall box". Boxes for installation within timber/plasterboard walls are usually called [...] "cavity boxes" [...] or [...] "plasterboard boxes". British English speakers also tend to say [...] "pattress box" [...] instead of just [...] "pattress". Pattress is alternatively spelt [...] "patress" [...] and Wiktionary lists both spellings. The word [...] "pattress", despite being attested from the late 19th century, is still rarely found in most dictionaries. It is etymologically derived from pateras (Latin for bowls, saucers).|$|E
5000|$|Outdoor Floodlights: Instead of {{the usual}} team challenge, this episode has the five lead members of each team (and Tyler, {{as a reward for}} the Pink Team’s victory in the {{previous}} challenge) attend a lesson on how to install an outdoor security floodlight, controlled by a switch inside the cabin. They will then be tasked with instructing their partners on how to install the floodlight on their cabins, with the caveat that the lead members cannot take any hands-on role, and will be ejected from the cabin if they set hands on the job even once (something that would ultimately happen to every team leader except for Fabian). The Green Team again performs the worst, as Jake bizarrely insists that Nicole install the switch {{in the middle of the}} cabin rather than by the door, something that she eventually corrects, but costs them valuable time. Additionally, Nicole fails to properly mount the light due to losing some of the necessary screws, and does such a poor wiring job that not only do two switches have to be turned on two switch on the light when only one should be necessary, the circuit isn’t even grounded, resulting in the experts declaring the job unsafe and refusing to test it. The Purple Team has a stormy build, with Richelene twice trying to give up due to the stress caused by the installation. She, too, fails to properly ground her circuit. Despite Fabian not actually being ejected, he proves very controlling and argues a lot with Luayn. While the Red Team’s light is installed mostly correctly, Luayn fails to correctly recess the <b>mounting</b> <b>box,</b> which will require additional work to make it waterproof. Tyler does a generally very solid job with the Pink Team’s light, but like Luayn, initially fails to realise that the box should be recessed. Tyler does try to correct the issue, but runs out of time and only succeeds in recessing it about halfway. The Blue Team are therefore the winners, as Jesse’s clear instructions (despite getting thrown out of the cabin) and Holly’s intelligent approach to the job leads to the job being completed to a near-perfect standard.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} a modification of the Miyake-Apple posterior video analysis for the simultaneous visualization of the anterior and posterior corneal surfaces during wet laboratory-based deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK). METHODS: A human donor corneoscleral button was affixed to a microscope slide and placed onto a custom-made <b>mounting</b> <b>box.</b> A big bubble DALK was performed on the cornea in the wet laboratory. An 11 -diopter intraocular lens was positioned over the aperture of the back camera of an iPhone. This served to video record the posterior view of the corneoscleral button during the big bubble formation. An overhead operating microscope with an attached video camcorder recorded the anterior view during the surgery. RESULTS: The anterior and posterior views of the wet laboratory-based DALK surgery were simultaneously captured and edited using video editing software. The formation of the big bubble can be studied. CONCLUSIONS: This video recording camera system has the potential to act as a valuable research and teaching tool in corneal lamellar surgery, especially in the behavior of the big bubble formation in DALK.

40|$|An {{inexpensive}} and simple hail monitor design {{has been developed}} that has a single piezoelectric ceramic disc and uses a metal plate as a sounding board. The structure is durable and able to withstand the launch environment. This design has several advantages over a multi-ceramic sensor, including reduced cost and complexity, increased durability, and improvement in impact response uniformity over the active surface. However, the most important characteristic of this design is the potential to use frequency discrimination between the spectrum created from raindrop impact and a hailstone impact. The sound of hail hitting a metal plate is distinctly different {{from the sound of}} rain hitting the same plate. This fortuitous behavior of the pyramid sensor may lead to a signal processing strategy, which is inherently more reliable than one depending on amplitude processing only. The initial concept has been im proved by forming a shallow pyramid structure so that hail is encouraged to bounce away from the sensor {{so as not to be}} counted more than once. The sloped surface also discourages water from collecting. Additionally, the final prototype version includes a <b>mounting</b> <b>box</b> for the piezo-ceramic, which is offset from the pyramid apex, thus helping to reduce non-uniform response (see Figure 2). The frequency spectra from a single raindrop impact and a single ice ball impact have been compared. The most notable feature of the frequency resonant peaks is the ratio of the 5. 2 kHz to 3. 1 kHz components. In the case of a raindrop, this ratio is very small. But in the case of an ice ball, the ratio is roughly one third. This frequency signature of ice balls should provide a robust method for discriminating raindrops from hailstones. Considering that hail size distributions (HSDs) and fall rates are roughly 1 percent that of rainfall, hailstone sizes range from a few tenths of a centimeter to several centimeters. There may be considerable size overlap between large rain and small hail. As hail occurs infrequently at KSC, the ideal HSD measurement sensor needs to have a collection area roughly 100 times greater than a raindrop-size distribution sensor or disdrometer. The sensitivity should be such that it can detect and count very small hail in the midst of intense rainfall consisting of large raindrop sizes. The dynamic range and durability should allow measurement of the largest hail sizes, and the operation and calibration strategy should consider the infrequent occurrence of hail fall over the KSC area...|$|E
