He presented mixed feelings towards Roday's performance, calling it [...] "fine as usual, but not as laugh out-loud funny".

[...] The Daily Telegraph gave it seven out of ten and stated, [...] "The combat, and it's worth noting that this makes {{up the majority of}} the game, is superb. It's not particularly deep nor clever, but it's immensely rewarding, as too are the scripted first person sections which exist purely to, yes, let you punch things in the face." [...] However, The Escapist gave the Xbox 360 version three stars out of five and said, [...] "Creative set-pieces and an awesome concept can only hide a repetitious game structure for so long - and the stealth sections that <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> are just frustrating." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lili's {{official}} {{style is}} street fighting, combined with gymnastic maneuvers such as flips, cartwheels and handstands. Mike Reilly of Game Revolution {{said in his}} 2006 review of Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection that Lili [...] "takes {{a good deal more}} practice to master", an issue he opined was offset by the presence of an in-game training mode. Brett Elston of GamesRadar commented on Lili's fighting style in the game: [...] "She doesn't really have a definable combat style, so it's mostly all flash and sexy high kicks ... her quick movements and wide-reaching legs make her ideal for first-timers—those same dance-like attacks also make it hard to get a bead on her next move". According to IGN, Lili's counterattacks, juggles and wall fighting in Tekken 6 are known to cause a lot of damage, but she was [...] "lacking in the low attack department and many of her crush attacks will leave her vulnerable." [...] Mike Harradence of PlayStation Universe wrote in 2012 that Lili's [...] "quirky yet ultimately unique style provides ample opportunity for juggles and she can <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> {{with the best of them}} thanks to an arrange of low-mid attacks."
