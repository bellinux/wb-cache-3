40|$|The {{development}} of a new environmental aware process for the cleaning of rotogravuere cylinders {{is the subject of this}} work. Therefore the optimisation, monitoring and automatic control of the process has been acquired for the large-area cleaning of rotogravure cylinders by excimer laser radiation. It has been realized by the design of an autonomous automatic cleaning machine which is available for the industrial use. Basic research concerning the optical characteristics of different printing inks has shown the special qualification of UV-lasers for this ablation process due to the high absorption of thin layers of ink. Further experiments explore the influence of the accumulated fluence, the pulse repetition rate and the meaning of diffent excimer-wavelengths on the ablation result. Experimental results are used to build-up a self-contained cleaning machine especially for the laser cleaning of rotogravure cylinders. Rotogravure cylinders are handled rotating in this machine. Meanwhile the laser beam strikes radial onto the surface of the cylinder and moves in a parallel way to the axis of the cylinder. The optical beam guiding and shaping system is designed as a "flying optic". It includes a reflective beam homogenizer and a zoom objective to enable variation of the beam size. This optical system is meant to be a new development to allow the large-area cleaning of surface layers by excimer laser radiation. The treatment of original rotogravure cylinders in this cleaning machine has shown that a non-destructive and complete cleaning can be realized with cleaning rates between 2, 4 and 11, 8 m²/h, depending on the colour tone and the layer thickness. In reality layer thicknesses are very inhomogeneous so that monitoring and processing control is necessary to reach complete cleaning on the whole surface of the cylinder. Monitoring is realized by an image processing unit including a colour picture evaluation for the identification of remaining ink. Cylinder cleaning is working in two steps. In the first step standard processing parameters are chosen by the control unit. During the treatment with standard parameters the video monitoring is recording the positions, dimensions and intensity of remaining ink. Positions of remaining ink are well directed approached and ablation is executed by adapted parameters within the second step which leads to complete cleaning. Cleaning process works automatically and beside the <b>mouting</b> of the cylinder the control only needs four input values of cylinder data from the operator. Compared to the investment for conventional cleaning technology (including disposal costs for cleaning solvents or abrasives) the costs for the laser cleaning process are competitive. In addition to that this process represents a progress within laser beam cleaning techonolgy and in the domain of material treatment by excimer lasers as a result of the high level of automation, the good quality of cleaning and further potential of development regarding new cleaning applications...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the problem of sociological {{investigation}} of the science of society. It postulates — as do some other sociological publications — the creation of the new sociological subdivision: the sociology of sociology. The present work gives a review of past attempts to think sociologically of sociology; it gives a critical analysis of the existing literature on the subject. The sociology of sociology falls into the broad scope of sociology of science, which again — according to Morton — is but a paart of the sociology of knowledge. All these sociological subdivisions have at the core the idea that human thought can be understood only if it is related to social existence, an idea — to be sure — of Marxist origin. After dealing briefly with the main contributions to the sociology of knowledge (Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Mannheim) and sociology of science (Morton, Barber),, the author turns to the main subject of his article. Sociology of sociology is still rather 'a point of view than the full-honored sociological subdiscipline. Sociology as a science is a specific form of social self-knowledge. We can distinguish two stages in its development: the 'precritical' phase, devoid of the consciousness of the social conditionning of the science of society (Mannheim's false consciousness'), and the 'critical' phase, characterized by the awareness of all factors which determine the development of sociology as a science and the social status and social role of sociologists as a group, as well as influence the conceptual framework and research methods of the science off society. Having examined the literaturę on the subject — explicitly off implicitly dealing with problems connected therewith — the author characterized the situation as follows: As predecessors can be considered: T. Veblen, F. Znaniecki, L. Wilson, R. S. Lynd, P. F. Lazarsffeld and W. Thielens, Jr. Of course, With some reservations. Their works fall into the broader field off sociology of science. F. Adler Was first — as far as one can judge — in using the term sociology of sociology', nota bene in form of a statement that 'a sociology of sociology, strictly speaking, is non existent'. C. W. Page postulates the construction of sociology of sociology and makes a substantial contribution to it analysing its place and role as a teaching institution. R. Aron, summing up the experiences of various countries, presented in national papers, formulates the thesis on the interrelation between the development of sociology and the stage of industrializaition (modernization) of society. C. W. Mills does not seek a social explanation for the lack of sociological imagination among some American sociologists. But he is fully alware off the social background of sociology and of its influence on the sociological craftsmanship. In his work therefore — which is not a conscious attempt in the field off sociology of sociology — there are many observations off great value for this division off sociology. The number of publication on the subject is now growing almost every year. The sociology of sociology, investigating the social context of the scientific research on society, is not free itself from the influence of the social conditions. There is recently, on the one hand, the <b>mouting</b> pressure of social demands on sociology, a hope, that sociology will enable the national social planning and improve the forms of siocial life. On the other hand, the sociologists themselves are {{aware of the fact that}} the prospective development of their discipline, that is the evolution of an empirically verifiable sociological theory and in this way the possibility to shape the social life — depends upon the sociological reflection on the science of society. If sociology is to fulfill the hopes attached to it, it has to reach the higher level of methodological maturity, which is equivalent to a sociology of sociology.

40|$|Military Operations in Urban Terrain (<b>MOUT)</b> {{require the}} {{capability}} to perceive and to analyse the situation around a patrol in order to recognize potential threats. As in <b>MOUT</b> scenarios threats usually arise from humans one important task is the robust detection of humans. Detection of humans in <b>MOUT</b> by image processing systems can be very challenging, e. g., due to complex outdoor scenes where humans have a weak contrast against the background or are partially occluded. Porikli et al. introduced covariance descriptors and showed their usefulness for human detection in complex scenes. However, these descriptors do not lie on a vector space and so well-known machine learning techniques need to be adapted to train covariance descriptor classifiers. We present a novel approach based on manifold learning that simplifies the classification of covariance descriptors. In this paper, we apply this approach for detecting humans. We describe our human detection method and evaluate the detector on benchmark data sets generated from real-world image sequences captured during <b>MOUT</b> exercises...|$|R
