50|$|Community-based {{monitoring}} (CBM) {{is a form}} {{of public}} oversight, ideally driven by local information needs and community values, to increase the accountability and quality of social services such as health, development aid, or to contribute to the management of natural resources. Within the CBM framework, members of a community affected by a social program or environmental change track this change and its local impacts, and generate demands, suggestions, critiques and data that they then act on, including by feeding back to the organization implementing the program or managing the environmental change.

50|$|Nigrini advocates two {{approaches}} to continuous transactions monitoring {{in his book}} on forensic analytics. The first approach is called the parallel scan where descriptive statistics related to the transactions {{in the current period}} are compared to the descriptive statistics for the prior periods. Large differences signal that something has changed. Had Knight Capital used such a metric on August 1, 2012 they would have seen, {{in a matter of minutes}} that their trading system was out of control. Nigrini also advocates risk scoring as a continuous <b>monitoring</b> <b>methodology.</b> Here forensic units (e.g., bank account customers, franchisees, travel agents, coupon redemptions, and locations) are scored on various predictors. The scores for the predictors are averaged and each unit ends up with a single risk score. High scores suggest a high risk of the behavior of interest and low scores are associated with a low risk. Audit activity would be directed towards those forensic units with high scores. The risk scoring approach can be programmed.|$|E
50|$|While {{there would}} always be some cheap {{domestic}} emission reductions available in Europe, the cost of switching from coal to gas could be in the order of €40-50 per tonne CO2 equivalent. Certified Emission Reductions from CDM projects were in 2006 traded on a forward basis for between €5 and €20 per tonne CO2 equivalent. The price depends on the distribution of risk between seller and buyer. The seller could get a very good price if it agrees to bear the risk that the project's baseline and <b>monitoring</b> <b>methodology</b> is rejected; that the host country rejects the project; that the CDM Executive Board rejects the project; that the project for some reason produces fewer credits than planned; or that the buyer doesn't get CERs at the agreed time if the international transaction log (the technical infrastructure ensuring international transfer of carbon credits) is not in place by then. The seller can usually only take these risks if the counterparty is deemed very reliable, as rated by international rating agencies.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: As of today, only few {{baseline}} and <b>monitoring</b> <b>methodologies</b> for bioenergy activities 2 have been registered under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) {{and only one}} has been approved so far. The Bio Carbon Fund (BCF) is expected to become operational in March 2004, while other comparable international financing schemes for climate change mitigation projects, such as CERUPT 3, the PCF 4 or GEF, have mostly focused on industrial processes and their potential for carbon emission reductions through increased energy efficiency and fuel switching. Due to the higher complexity of bioenergy systems, with responsibilities involving {{a number of different}} actors and sectors (agriculture, forestry, spatial planning, energy, environment), respective {{baseline and}} <b>monitoring</b> <b>methodologies</b> are not readily available, and their development and deployment could entail significant transaction costs. FAO and other organizations are trying to support developing countries and potential project participants in identifying and formulating projects covering the whole range of bioenergy activities. In this paper, first results of efforts on project identification, baseline and <b>monitoring</b> <b>methodologies</b> and eligibility in the area of flexible financial mechanisms (including CDM) and bioenergy will be analysed with regard to the following topics...|$|R
