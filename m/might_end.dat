In this episode, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) develops feelings for Kamala (Famke Janssen), a woman destined from childhood for an arranged marriage which hopefully <b>might</b> <b>end</b> a war between two planets. Picard steps in to help in the peace ceremony and later gives Kamala away at her wedding.|$|E
5|$|Bovidae have {{featured}} in stories {{since at least}} the time of Aesop's fables from Ancient Greece around 600 BC. Fables by Aesop include The Crow and the Sheep, The Frog and the Ox, and The Wolf and the Lamb. The mythological creature Chimera, depicted as a lion, with the head of a goat arising from its back, and a tail that <b>might</b> <b>end</b> with a snake's head, was one of the offspring of Typhon and Echidna and a sibling of such monsters as Cerberus and the Lernaean Hydra. The sheep, synonymous with the goat in Chinese mythology, is the eighth animal of the Chinese zodiac, and a symbol of filial piety.|$|E

5|$|In the {{original}} Holliday model for homologous recombination, single-strand breaks {{occur at the}} same point on one strand of each parental DNA. Free ends of each broken strand then migrate across to the other DNA helix. There, the invading strands are joined to the free ends they encounter, resulting in the Holliday junction. As each crossover strand reanneals to its original partner strand, it displaces {{the original}} complementary strand ahead of it. This causes the Holliday junction to migrate, creating the heteroduplex segments. Depending on which strand was used as a template to repair the other, the four cells resulting from meiosis <b>might</b> <b>end</b> up with three copies of one allele and only one of the other, instead of the normal two of each, a property known as gene conversion.|$|E
5|$|The Singaporean Parliament is unicameral in nature, {{consisting}} of a single legislative body tasked with making laws. However, {{the notion of a}} second legislative chamber was considered on two separate occasions. In 1954, a constitutional commission headed by Sir George William Rendel rejected a proposal for a second chamber composed solely of minority representatives, citing its unsuitability in a tiny state like Singapore and arguing that it <b>might</b> <b>end</b> up being unnecessarily bureaucratic. It also asserted that such an upper House might potentially be detrimental to social cohesion. This issue was also considered by the Wee Chong Jin Commission, which rejected it on similar grounds.|$|E

25|$|Some Jewish historians {{suggest a}} {{different}} {{explanation for the}} rabbinic reluctance to laud the militarism. First, the rabbis wrote after Hasmonean leaders had led Judea into Rome’s grip and so may not have wanted to offer the family much praise. Second, they clearly wanted to promote a sense of dependence on God, urging Jews to look toward the divine for protection. They likely feared inciting Jews to another revolt that <b>might</b> <b>end</b> in disaster, like the AD 135 experience.|$|E

25|$|The Finnish and Baltic invasions {{caused a}} {{deterioration}} {{of relations between}} Germany and the Soviet Union. Because of tensions caused by these invasions, Germany's falling behind in deliveries of goods, and Stalin's worries that Hitler's war with the West <b>might</b> <b>end</b> quickly after France signed an armistice, in August 1940, the Soviet Union briefly suspended its deliveries under the German-Soviet Commercial Agreement. The suspension created significant resource problems for Germany. By the end of August, relations improved again.|$|E

Upon agreeing to the armistice, the belligerents established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which has since been patrolled by the KPA and ROKA, United States, and Joint UN Commands.|$|E

25|$|Mabinogi uses an instanced dungeon system, with random map generation, {{that allows}} dungeon {{exploration}} by multiple players {{at the same}} time. When a player enters a dungeon, he will find a lobby with a statue of the goddess, and a platform before it. A separate dungeon instance is created for every unique type of item thrown on the platform (for dungeon passes, a unique instance is created for each instance of pass dropped). Depending on what the player drops, he <b>might</b> <b>end</b> up in a dungeon instance with players already in it.|$|E
25|$|Sampling schemes may {{be without}} {{replacement}} ('WOR'—no element can be selected {{more than once}} in the same sample) or with replacement ('WR'—an element may appear multiple times in the one sample). For example, if we catch fish, measure them, and immediately return them to the water before continuing with the sample, this is a WR design, because we <b>might</b> <b>end</b> up catching and measuring the same fish more than once. However, if we do not return the fish to the water (e.g., if we eat the fish), this becomes a WOR design.|$|E
25|$|In August 1940, the Soviet Union briefly {{suspended}} its deliveries {{after their}} relations were strained following disagreement over {{policy in the}} Balkans, the Soviet Union's war with Finland (from which Germany had imported 88.9 million Reichsmarks in goods in 1938), Germany falling behind in its deliveries of goods under the pact and with Stalin worried that Hitler's war with the West <b>might</b> <b>end</b> quickly after France signed an armistice. By the end of August, relations improved again as the countries had redrawn the Hungarian and Romanian borders, settled Bulgarian claims and Stalin was again convinced that Germany would face a long war in the west with Britain's improvement in its air battle with Germany and the execution of an agreement between the United States and Britain regarding destroyers and bases. Soviet raw material deliveries increased well over prior figures.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} {{emission}} and absorption of photons seemed {{to demand that}} the conservation of energy will hold at best on average. If a wave containing exactly one photon passes over some atoms, {{and one of them}} absorbs it, that atom needs to tell the others that they can't absorb the photon anymore. But if the atoms are far apart, any signal cannot reach the other atoms in time, and they <b>might</b> <b>end</b> up absorbing the same photon anyway and dissipating the energy to the environment. When the signal reached them, the other atoms would have to somehow recall that energy. This paradox led Bohr, Kramers and Slater to abandon exact conservation of energy. Heisenberg's formalism, when extended to include the electromagnetic field, was obviously going to sidestep this problem, a hint that the interpretation of the theory will involve wavefunction collapse.|$|E
25|$|In {{a signed}} affidavit, Siddiqui's {{maternal}} uncle, Shams ul-Hassan Faruqi, stated that on 22 January 2008 she {{visited him in}} Islamabad and told him she had been held by Pakistani agencies. Knowing he had worked in Afghanistan and made contact with the Taliban in 1999, she asked for his help to cross into Taliban-controlled Afghanistan where {{she thought she would}} be safe. He told her he was no longer in touch with them. He notified his sister, Siddiqui's mother, who came the next day to see her daughter. He said that Siddiqui stayed with them for two days. Investigating the disappearance, a US journalist (Deborah Scroggins) reported that Geo TV presenter Hamid Mir informed her that friends of Siddiqui believed she had gone underground avoiding the FBI. Scroggins was also warned by Pakistanis with jihadist connections (including Khalid Khawaja) that she (Scroggins) <b>might</b> <b>end</b> up like Daniel Pearl (beheaded) if she attempted to pursue finding Siddiqui.|$|E

He left Liao Hua behind in Chengzhong Mountain (成重山) {{to build a}} fortress and gather the remaining Qiang forces and keep them as hostages in the fortress. When Guo Huai heard about Jiang Wei's advances, he wanted to divide his forces into two groups to attack the enemy. His officers, however, had a different opinion. They expected to Jiang Wei to head west to meet Zhiwudai and combine their forces, while Liao Hua would remain behind to defend the Shu position at Chengzhong Mountain. If they split their army into two, their attacking power would be greatly reduced, and they <b>might</b> <b>end</b> up {{in a situation where}} they were able to neither resist Jiang Wei nor capture Liao Hua's position. They urged Guo Huai to concentrate on advancing westward to attack Jiang Wei and Zhiwudai separately before they could meet up.|$|E
