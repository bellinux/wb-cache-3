50|$|A {{community}} {{project is a}} term applied to any community-based project. This covers {{a wide variety of}} different areas within a community or a group of networking entities. Projects can cover almost anything, including the most obvious section of concern to any community, the welfare element. Welfare {{community project}}s would for example be, a locally run and locally funded orphanage; a Christmas dinner kitchen for the homeless. Another important sector of importance to the community would be charity. Charitable projects in the community can include, but are not limited to, ecological charities concerned with either the <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>spaces,</b> or in some cases, the prevention of the reduction/removal of green spaces. An old clothes collection service would also be a community-based charity project. One important subdivision of community projects, and at times overlooked, is those of an economic nature such as LETS. The highlight of economic community projects is what is known as Transition Towns. Most economic community projects are designed at creating some sort of economic autonomy.|$|E

In Sweden, these green spaces {{are an important part of}} the urban green structure and the housing companies who manage these spaces are important green space providers. However, the management and maintenance of such green spaces and its benefits for residents seldom receive attention in research. The residents’ perspective is the main interest here, since they are to benefit from maintenance. The perspective of the providers (housing staff) is also included, because of their influence through provision on residents’ experiences. Taking an ex-plorative and mainly qualitative approach, two empirical studies were conducted using interviews as the main method of collecting data. In a case study of three rental and multi-family housing areas, 27 residents and 13 housing staff were interviewed regarding their experience of the maintenance of green space and their views on maintenance provision respectively. In a telephone survey of 30 municipal housing companies, housing staff were asked how they organised <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>spaces</b> and what motivated that choice. The case study identified several benefits of green space maintenance for residents and three were further explored: (1) green space being ‘well-kept’ (2) the housing area being safe and (3) a just distribution of maintenance. The results showed that several elements of maintenance and the social context, such as views of maintenance staff and of other residents, contribute to residents’ experience of these bene-fits. Views of well-kept green space were for example not simply about technical quality but e. g. the image of maintenance staff and their efforts was also considered.

40|$|Terrestrial {{vegetation}} plays many pivotal {{roles in}} urban systems. However, {{the impacts of}} urbanization on vegetation are poorly understood. Here we examined the spatiotemporal trends of the vegetation activity measured by MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) along Urban Development Intensity (UDI) gradient in 32 major Chinese cities from 2000 to 2012. We also proposed to use {{a new set of}} concepts (i. e., actual, theoretical, and positive urbanization effects) to better understand and quantify the impacts of urbanization on vegetation activities. Results showed that the EVI decreased significantly along a rising UDI for 28 of 32 cities (p < 0. 05) in linear, convex or concave form, signifying the urbanization impacts on vegetation varied across cities and UDI zones within a city. Further, the actual urbanization effects were much weaker than the theoretical estimates because of the offsetting positive effects generated by multiple urban environmental and anthropogenic factors. Examining the relative changes of EVI in various UDI zones against that in the rural area (Delta EVI), which effectively removed the effects of climate variability, demonstrated that Delta EVI decreased markedly from 2000 to 2012 for about three-quarters of the cities in the exurban (0. 05 <= (JDI 025) and suburban (0. 25 <= UDI 0. 5), and only half of the cities in the urban (0. 5 <= UDI 0. 75) and urban core (0. 75 <= 1). The stable or even increasing tendencies of Delta EVI in the urban and urban core of many cities could primarily be attributed to the importance of positive effects derived from the urban environment and the improvement <b>of</b> management and <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> urban <b>green</b> <b>space.</b> More work is needed to quantify mechanistically the detailed negative and positive effects of urban environmental factors and management practices on vegetation activities.

A first aim is to clarify howthe different stakeholders (people in poverty, fieldworkers, and policy makers) give meaning to this initiative. A second aim is to deepening an existing theory on ‘restrictive and reflexive activation’ (Weil, Wildemeersch & Jansen, 2005). NPS’s have the ambition to be an alternative to the rather restrictive labour-market oriented activation approachs that nowadays are dominant in Flanders and elsewhere. While struggling to make room for elements of reflexive activation they encounter pressure from an efficiency-driven managerial discourse, which finds its expression inthe restrictive activation discourse. NPS’s are inceasingly requested to account for their activities on the basis perfomance indicators with regard to the employment of their clients). NPS’s also have the ambition to create a base of democratic citizenship through experiences of participation. This function is aimed at improvingthe quality of life in neighbourhoods that are considered to lack social cohesion. Also here the results should be accounted for in quantitave terms, however difficult this is.,. Participatory observation in the NPS practices {{was one of the main}} strategies to collect empirical data. During the data collection and interpretation, several fields of tension were identified in collaboration with the professionals involved in the NPS’s. First, we identified the classical tension between achieving better results through participation (participation as an instrument) and creating a forum for democratic decision making (participation as a goal in itself). Second, we discussed the tension between constrained labour-market oriention towards ‘employment’ and a wider, more comprehensive definition of work and engagement.

The failure of other countries to achieve regional goals of natural and cultural heritage protection {{on the ground in}} this way (Peterson et al, 2007; Ryan et al, 2006; von Haaren and Reich, 2006) suggests that there may be flaws in the underpinning concepts that are widely circulated in North American and Western European literature (Jongman et al, 2004; Walmsley, 2006). In China, regional open <b>space</b> networks, regional <b>green</b> infrastructure or regional ecological corridors as we know them in the West, are also likely to be problematic, at least in the foreseeable future. Reasons supporting this view can be drawn from lessons learned from project experience in landscape planning and related fields of study in China and overseas. Implementation <b>of</b> valuable regional <b>green</b> <b>space</b> networks is problematic because: •	the concept of region as a spatial unit for planning <b>green</b> <b>space</b> networks is ambiguous and undefinable for practical purposes; •	regional <b>green</b> <b>space</b> networks traditionally require top down inter-governmental cooperation and coordination which are generally hampered by inequalities of influence between and within government agencies; •	no coordinating body with funding powers exists for regional <b>green</b> <b>space</b> development and infrastructure authorities are still in transition from engineering authorities; •	like other infrastructure projects, <b>green</b> <b>space</b> is likely to become a competitive rather than a complementary resource for city governments; •	stable long-term management, <b>maintenance</b> and uses <b>of</b> <b>green</b> <b>space</b> networks must fit into a ‘family’ social structure rather than a ‘public good’ social structure, particularly as rural and urban property rights are being re-negotiated with city governments; and •	<b>green</b> <b>space</b> provision is a performance indicator of urban improvement in cities within the city hierarchy and remains quantitatively-based (land area, tree number and per capita share) rather than qualitatively-based with local people as the focus. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{majority}} of Sweden’s population, about 80 %, lives in urban environments, and a {{majority of}} them live in residential complexes with shared residential yards. People spend a large part of their time in or around their home, which is why the outside environment and the <b>green</b> <b>space</b> in the area play an important part in a person’s well being. The <b>green</b> yard offers <b>space</b> for children’s activities, recreation, solitude, relaxation and gardening and gives the opportunity to learn and understand nature and its processes. The green yard also constitutes a part of the city’s factual green structure, informal <b>green</b> <b>spaces</b> that are not owned by the city and are therefore not included in the formal planning processes. The green residential yards also provide a number of ecosystem services such as climate regulation, purification of water and air and rainwater infiltration, all of which are of importance in the fight against climate change. The goal of this thesis has been to present the advantages an improved planning and <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> the urban <b>green</b> <b>space</b> and the residential yard in particular can offer. A number of important properties and functions that affect a yard’s functionality and how it is perceived are also presented and explained. The paper also aims to offer {{a better understanding of the}} garden’s role in improving the social conditions in the neighbourhood, and of the importance of involving the residents in planning and maintaining the <b>green</b> <b>spaces.</b> A number <b>of</b> case studies and analyses offer a more concrete perspective on the real world situations, and of successful refurbishment projects. Involving the residents in the formal planning and building processes has been proved to have positive effects on revitalising areas such as Gårdsten in Göteborg. Tenant involvement in open space management can lead to a positive spiral where people start caring for and identifying themselves with their neighbourhood, which can reduce the degree of stigmatisation and marginalisation...|$|R
