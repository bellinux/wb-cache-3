25|$|<b>Market</b> <b>volatility,</b> {{and thus}} {{increased}} returns, during 1830 encouraged Brazilian entrepreneurs to shift their attention from gold to coffee, a crop hitherto reserved for local consumption. Concurrent with this shift was the commissioning of vital infrastructures, including approximately 7,000km of railroads between 1860 and 1885. The creation of these railways enabled {{the importation of}} workers, {{in order to meet}} the enormous need for labor. This development primarily affected the State of Rio de Janeiro, as well as the Southern States of Brazil, most notably São Paulo, due to its favourable climate, soils, and terrain.|$|E
25|$|In mid-2007, the {{subprime}} mortgage crisis spread to the wider U.S. financial sector. The resulting situation became acute in September 2008, ushering {{in a period of}} unusual <b>market</b> <b>volatility,</b> encompassing record 100-point swings in both directions and reaching the highest levels since 1929. On November 20, 2008, the index closed at 752.44, its lowest since early 1997. A modest recovery the following day still left the index down 45.5% for the year. This year-to-date loss was the greatest since 1931, when the broad market declined more than 50%. The index closed the year at 903.25, for a loss of 38.5%. The market continued to decline in early 2009, surrounding the financial crisis of 2008. The index reached a nearly 13-year low, closing at 676.53, on March 9, 2009.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the contemporaneous and dynamic {{relationships between the}} volatilities of the technology stocks in the S&P 100 index. Factor analysis and heterogeneous autoregressive regressions are used to examine contemporaneous and dynamic, inter-temporal relationships, respectively.

We find that a strong industry effect explains {{the bulk of the}} volatility of the technology stocks and that the <b>market’s</b> <b>volatility</b> has very low correlation with the stocks’ volatility. Further, we find the <b>market’s</b> <b>volatility</b> has insignificant predictive content for the stocks’ volatility.

I find that in Latin American <b>markets</b> <b>volatility</b> declines significantly with different forms of foreign investment liberalization, and in Asian <b>markets</b> <b>volatility</b> does not increase significantly. Volatility is driven by domestic factors in South America, but the transmission of volatility from the United States to Mexico increases after liberalization.

25|$|During {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, CNBC's ratings were {{increasing}} sharply {{along with the}} stock market, often beating those of CNN during market hours. In 2000, daytime viewership of the network peaked at 343,000, around the time the Nasdaq Composite crossed 5000. However, when the dot-com bubble began to burst later that year, CNBC's viewing figures declined in tandem. The network's ratings steadily fell quarter after quarter, year after year, until bottoming in Q1 2005, with an average viewership of 134,000 during the day. From the bottom, the network, along with the markets, rebounded significantly – average daytime viewership (6 a.m. to 6 p.m.) reached a 7-year high of 310,000 viewers {{in the first quarter}} of 2008. Coinciding with the extreme <b>market</b> <b>volatility</b> of the ongoing global economic crisis, ratings hit an all-time high of 416,000 in Q3. Although the figures remain considerably less than those achieved by Fox News and CNN today, it has still had a 210% increase in viewership since the beginning of 2005. Despite the viewership slump at the turn of the decade, CNBC has remained extremely profitable: average annual revenues top $500 million while profits for the network exceeded $333 million in 2007, making CNBC a cash cow for NBC Universal and its parent company, Comcast. CNBC is the second most profitable of NBC Universal's thirteen cable channels in the United States, behind only the USA Network.|$|E
2500|$|Local {{conditions}} {{also affect}} exports; [...] state over-regulation in several African nations can prevent their own exports from becoming competitive. Research in Public Choice economics {{such as that}} of Jane Shaw suggest that protectionism operates in tandem with heavy State intervention combining to depress economic development. Farmers subject to import and export restrictions cater to localized markets, exposing them to higher <b>market</b> <b>volatility</b> and fewer opportunities. When subject to uncertain market conditions, farmers press for governmental intervention to suppress competition in their markets, resulting in competition being driven out of the market. As competition is driven out of the market, farmers innovate less and grow less food further undermining economic performance.|$|E

40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to test the effects of <b>market</b> {{leadership}} <b>volatility</b> on industry price change in Japanese manufacturing industries.

But, it is necessary to note that its effect is not strong enough to offset the concentration’s effect, since concentration still is positively related to price change.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a real options {{model of a}} price-setting cartel under uncertainty to examine whether <b>market</b> demand <b>volatility</b> facilitates collusion or not. We {{show that there is}} a critical level of market demand (the optimal defection trigger) above which firms find it desirable to defect from the cartel. We show further that an increase in the underlying market demand uncertainty has two opposing effects on the optimal defection trigger. First, the increased <b>market</b> demand <b>volatility</b> gives rise to the usual positive effect on option value that lifts up the optimal defection trigger. Second, the increased <b>market</b> demand <b>volatility</b> calls for an upward adjustment of the discount rate and thus creates a negative effect on option value that pushes down the optimal defection trigger. We show that the negative effect dominates (is dominated by) the positive effect when the underlying market demand uncertainty is trivial (significant), thereby rendering a U-shaped pattern of the optimal defection trigger against the <b>market</b> demand <b>volatility.</b> ...|$|R
