50|$|<b>Molasses</b> <b>grass</b> plays a {{large role}} in fire ecology in the regions where it grows. In the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) this species is {{invasive}} and dominant due to the increased frequency of fire. When a wild fire occurs, <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> is very quick to colonize the disturbed area. Examples of this are seen in almost every region where <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> is found, including Australia, Brazil, and Hawaii where <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> even increases the risk of fire in the areas in which it establishes. <b>Molasses</b> <b>grass</b> increases the likelihood of fires where it has established because it is brittle and burns easily. This cycle where <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> establishes, burns easily, then reestablishes and burns again is known as the grass/fire cycle, and it undermines native plants’ ability to grow and thrive in their native environment. One result of this cycle is a drop in biodiversity in the affected area.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{perennial}} grass native to Africa. Its seeds are dispersed by wind. <b>Molasses</b> <b>grass</b> usually grows to be thirty to sixty inches tall, and it forms mats when its long, slender stems lay {{on top of}} each other in layers up to four feet deep. <b>Molasses</b> <b>grass</b> can spread up other plants, using them as support, like a vine.

5000|$|The [...] "push" [...] in the {{intercropping}} {{scheme is}} provided by the plants that emit chemicals (kairomones) which repel stemborer moths and drive them away from the main crop (maize or sorghum). The best candidates discovered so far with the repellent properties are species of leguminous genus Desmodium. Desmodium is planted in between the rows of maize or sorghum. Being a low-growing plant, it does not interfere with the crops' growth and, furthermore, has the advantage of maintaining soil stability, improving soil fertility through enhanced soil organic matter content and nitrogen fixation. It also serves as a highly nutritious animal feed and effectively suppresses striga weeds.

40|$|Olfactory {{responses}} of the cereal stemborer parasitoid Cotesia sesamiae to volatiles emitted by gramineous host and nonhost plants of the stemborers were studied in a Y-tube olfactometer. The host plants were maize (Zea mays) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), while the nonhost plant was <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> (Melinis minutiflora). In single-choice tests, females of C. sesamiae chose volatiles from infested and uninfested host plants and <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> over volatiles from the control (soil). In dual-choice tests, the wasp preferred volatiles from infested host plants to those from uninfested host plants. There was no discrimination between <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> volatiles and those of uninfested maize, uninfested sorghum, or infested maize. The wasp preferred sorghum volatiles over maize. Combining uninfested maize or sorghum with <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> did not make volatiles from the combination more attractive as compared to only uninfested host plants. Infested maize alone was as attractive as when combined with <b>molasses</b> <b>grass.</b> Infested sorghum was preferred over its combination with <b>molasses</b> <b>grass.</b> Local growth conditions of the molasses grasses influenced attractiveness to the parasitoids.

40|$|Stemborers {{are major}} pests of {{maize and sorghum}} in {{tropical}} Africa. Various management approaches to stemborer control are being sought with emphasis on those that are environmentally sound, sustainable and economically feasible. Studies reported in this thesis were conducted to explore the potential of employing habitat management techniques to enhance the effectiveness of stemborer parasitoids. Emphasis {{was placed on the}} chemical and behavioural ecology of stemborer parasitoids in a diversified system that consisted of the stemborer host plants, maize and sorghum, stemborers and a non-host plant, <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> (Melinis minutiflora). Olfactometric studies on the stimuli involved in long-range foraging behaviour of the parasitoids Cotesia sesamiae and Dentichasmias busseolae revealed that host plant volatiles {{play a major role in}} guiding searching parasitoids to habitats that harbour their hosts. Volatiles from herbivore-injured plants were the most attractive. Sorghum was more attractive to the parasitoids than maize. <b>Molasses</b> <b>grass</b> volatiles were attractive to C. sesamiae but repellent to D. busseolae. Combining host plants and <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> did not have an additive effect of increasing the response of the parasitoids. Local growth conditions influenced the volatile blend produced by <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> grown in two different locations in Kenya, Thika and Mbita. This was manifested by their differential attractiveness to C. sesamiae. Dentichasmias busseolae did not discriminate between host species at a distance based on the volatiles released by infested host plants. Headspace analyses of volatiles emitted by uninfested and infested host plants and <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> grown at Thika and Mbita, revealed qualitative differences in their compositions. Infested host plants released a richer volatile blend than the uninfested host plants. Most of the compounds identified in the herbivore-injured plants were previously reported to play a role in parasitoid recruitment. <b>Molasses</b> <b>grass</b> from Thika had a number of its identified compounds that were similar to some in the blend of infested host plants. These compounds might have played a role in attracting C. sesamiae. <b>Molasses</b> <b>grass</b> from Mbita had very few compounds common to the other plants. Semi-field studies on the close-range searching behaviour of C. sesamiae showed that the parasitoid was not arrested by <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> although the grass had previously been demonstrated to be attractive to this parasitoid. The presence of <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> in a patch with host plants did not interfere with the foraging behaviour of D. busseolae. Both parasitoids recognized host plants at close range and were arrested on infested host plants where they spent most of their time engaged in host searching activities. Field studies showed that stemborer densities were lower in the intercrop than in the monocrop, while diversifying the habitat with <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> had no effect on stemborer parasitism. Larval and pupal parasitism was 2. 1 and 11. 0 % in the monocrop compared to 2. 0 and 9. 8 % in the intercrop. The main conclusion of this thesis is that intercropping maize or sorghum with <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> does not enhance the foraging behaviour of stemborer parasitoids. <b>Molasses</b> <b>grass</b> seems to be of more importance to the herbivore than the parasitoids. Hence, to clearly understand why stemborer densities were lower in the intercrop than the monocrop, future studies should focus on the interrelations between <b>molasses</b> <b>grass,</b> stemborers and host plants...|$|E

The behavior of D. busseolae was observed in a diversified habitat that consisted of stemborer host plants (maize, Zea mays L. and sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L). Moench (Poaceae)) and a non-host plant (<b>molasses</b> <b>grass,</b> Melinis minutiflora Beauv. (Poaceae)), while C. sesamiae was observed separately on host plants and <b>molasses</b> <b>grass.</b> In previous olfactometer studies, C. sesamiae was attracted to <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> volatiles while hboxD. busseolae was repelled. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the influence of <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> on close-range foraging behavior of the parasitoids in an arena that included infested and uninfested host plants. Dentichasmias busseolae strongly discriminated between host and non-host plants, with female wasps spending most of the time on infested host plants and least time on <b>molasses</b> <b>grass.</b> Likewise, C. sesamiae spent more time on uninfested and infested host plants than it did on <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> in single choice bioassays.

The studies were conducted to explore the possibility of intercropping stemborer host plants with <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> {{in order to enhance}} the foraging activity of D. busseolae in such a diversified agro-ecosystem. Olfactometric bioassays showed that volatiles from the host plants maize, Zea mays L., and sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) (Poaceae), were attractive to the parasitoid. Infested host plants were the most attractive. Volatiles from <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> were repellent to the parasitoid. Further tests showed that volatiles from infested and uninfested host plants alone were preferred over those from infested and uninfested host plants combined with the non-host plant, <b>molasses</b> <b>grass.</b> In dual choice tests, the parasitoid did not discriminate between volatiles from maize infested by either of the two herbivore species, C. partellus or Busseola fusca Fuller (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae).

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{invasion}} of exotic species {{is considered to}} be a major threat to the preservation of biodiversity. In the Parque Nacional de Brasília (National Park of Brasília), the invasive Melinis minutiflora (<b>molasses</b> <b>grass)</b> occupies more than 10 % of the area of the park. The present, long-term, study compared two treatments of exposure to molasses grass: 1) fire and 2) integrated management (fire + herbicide sprays + manual removal). The aerial biomass of <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> in the experimental area initially represented ca. 55 % of the total aerial biomass, a percentage that apparently did not influence native plant species richness at this site. Fire alone was not sufficient to control <b>molasses</b> <b>grass,</b> which attained its pre-treatment biomass values after two years. Integrated management reduced, and maintained, biomass to less than 1 % of its original value after ten years, and maintained this level throughout the study, demonstrating that it is a promising strategy for the recovery of areas invaded by <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> in the Cerrado. However, because of the recolonization by <b>molasses</b> <b>grass,</b> long-term monitoring efforts are targeting outbreaks, which would require immediate intervention in order to maintain the native biological diversity of the region...|$|E
40|$|Maternal host choices during {{oviposition}} by herbivorous insects {{determine the}} fitness of their offspring {{and may be}} influenced by environmental changes that can alter host-plant quality. This is of particular relevance to ‘push-pull’ cropping systems where host preferences are exploited to manage insect pest populations. We tested how drought stress in maize and companion plants that are used in these systems affect oviposition preference, larval feeding, and development of the spotted stemborer, Chilo partellus Swinhoe (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). Five host species were tested (all Poaceae) : maize (Zea mays L.), Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach), signal grass [Brachiaria brizantha (A. Rich) Stapf], Brachiaria cv. ‘Mulato’, and <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> [Melinis minutiflora (Beauv.) ]. Under drought stress, maize experienced as much oviposition as control unstressed maize in choice and no-choice experiments. Similarly, larval leaf damage was not significantly different in drought-stressed vs. unstressed maize. In contrast, oviposition occurred less on drought-stressed than on unstressed Napier and signal grass. Oviposition acceptance and leaf damage remained low in both drought-stressed and unstressed <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> and Mulato. Larval survival and development remained high in drought-stressed maize, but not in Napier, signal, and <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> and Mulato, where survival and development were low in both drought-stressed and unstressed plants. Our results indicate that herbivore responses to drought-stressed plants depend on the plant species and that drought stress can change host preference and acceptance rankings. In particular, trap-crops such as Napier grass may not divert oviposition from the main maize crop under drought stress conditions...|$|E

Alien grasses that promote fire invaded the submontane seasonal zone of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park starting in the 1960 s. These grasses recover rapidly from fire, maintain a high dead-to-live biomass ratio, and burn at high relative humidities. Since 1970, the invasion of fire-promoting grasses has increased fire frequency 10 -fold and fire size over 1000 -fold. We monitored plant cover and density after 11 fires in 16 sites throughout the range of the submontane seasonal zone. These fires occurred between 1972 and 1992, and were sampled 1 - 21 years after fire. Fire significantly reduced native vegetation, almost entirely represented in the submontane seasonal zone by native trees and shrubs. The monodominant tree species, 'ohi'a (Metrosideros polymorpha), did not regenerate from seed in any burn. Fire killed on average 46 % of 'ohi'a, markedly thinning forests and woodlands. Native shrub cover declined 17 -fold, with the near loss of the formerly dominant shrub pukiawe (Styphelia tameiameiae) from most burns. The fire tolerant native shrub 'a'ali'i (Dodonaea viscosa) persisted in <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> sites and appeared to be capable of recovering to its former dominance in burns in which it was especially abundant prior to fire and <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> was absent. The loss of native trees and shrubs was greater in burns affected by high intensity fire. Alien grass cover and biomass increased in almost all burns, particularly where <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> (Melinis minutiflora) was present prior to fire. Fire enhanced the establishment of the aggressive alien invader faya tree (Myrica faya), especially in shrublands.

40|$|In eastern Africa, farmers plant napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) or Sudan grass (Sorghum vulgare sudanese) as a trap weed in maize. The stem borer, {{accountable}} {{for up to}} 30 % yield losses in maize, prefers these grasses to maize. Two other weeds are planted that repel stemborers: <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> (Melinis minutifolia) or the silver-leafed desmodium (Desmodium uncinatum). The trick is to plant repellent weeds in the maize field to chase out the stemborers, and to plant the trap weed {{on the edges of}} the field. The stemborers are caught in the sticky substance that these trap weeds produce. Both napier and Sudan grass are also used as fodder. <b>Molasses</b> <b>grass</b> not only repels stemborers but also ticks. Nonetheless, desmodium seems to excel its colleagues in usefulness. It fixes nitrogen in the soil, is an important source of fodder, repels stemborers and most surprisingly: it turns out to repel the noxious weed striga too (see other box). During trials, as much as 40 times less striga was found in the desmodium maize fields, compared to mono-cropped maize. The International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology, based in Nairobi, developed, tested and disseminated the combined intercropping system. It has caught on extremely well. Farmers both smallholder and large commercial from Ethiopia to Tanzania are now planting desmodium in their maize. One spin-off effect of this popularity is that selling desmodium seed has become an emerging income-generating opportunity. In Togo and Benin, Mucuna spp. have been brought into action as cover crops to restore the fertility of arable land and reduce weed infestation. It has caught on especially in areas of high rural population density, where land pressure is high and periods of fallow are not long enough. Growing mucuna during the improved fallowing suppresses spear grass infestation (Imperata cylindrica) but it is also grown intercropped with maize.

40|$|Stemborers {{can cause}} immense damage to maize and sorghum: {{in some cases}} losses as high as 80 % have been recorded, {{especially}} with one particularly damaging species, Chilo partellus. Stemborers are difficult to control by chemical means because of their habit of burrowing inside the plants. Scientists at the Institute for Arable Crops Research (IACR-Rothamsted), UK, the International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE), Kenya and the Kenyan Agricultural Research Institute (KARI), have made some interesting discoveries during their search for {{an effective means of}} biological control to the stemborer problem. Together, these organizations started by selecting grasses, which are more attractive to the stemborers than the cereal crops they attack, to act as 'trap' crops around the perimeter of crop fields. However, they also found that some plants acted as 'repellent' crops and drove the insects away. One of these, <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> (Melinis minutiflora), when grown in every third row of crop, proved particularly effective in driving the stemborers away from maize and sorghum and into the trap crops planted {{around the edge of the}} field. The <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> was found to have the additional benefit of exuding a chemical which attracted parasitic wasps of stemborer, which were deceived into thinking that there were higher numbers of stemborers present in the cereal crop. The wasps proceeded to kill the stemborers that were in the crop before flying on to adjacent fields and attacking the stemborers present there. The trap crops, which were of napier grass or sudan grass planted round the edges of the fields, also had additional benefits. Both grasses are not only good for stabilizing soil but are also good forage crops that can be cut-and-carried for zero-grazed cattle. Napier grass is also able to survive during periods of drought, and can act as a wind-break and prevent wind-lodging, which is common when the stems of maize and sorghum have been damaged by stemborers.

A novel IPM approach dubbed “push–pull” has been developed and implemented in eastern Africa, based on locally available companion plants, that effectively addresses these constraints resulting in substantial grain yield increases. The technology involves intercropping cereal crops with stemborer moth repellent crops (push), the forage legume desmodium or <b>molasses</b> <b>grass,</b> and planting the attractive Napier grass (pull) as a border crop. Desmodium is very effective in suppressing striga weed while improving soil fertility through nitrogen fixation and improved organic matter content. The companion plants provide high-value animal fodder, facilitating milk production and diversifying farmers’ income sources. The technology, currently practiced by over 55, 000 farmers in East Africa, has been adapted to dry conditions associated with climate change by identifying and incorporating drought-tolerant companion plants. The development of this technology, its benefits and subsequent efforts to expand its geographical suitability and effectiveness are described...|$|E
40|$|In the Cerrado Biome of Brazil, African grasses {{constitute}} a serious problem, occurring {{in virtually all}} protected areas. <b>Molasses</b> <b>grass</b> (Melinis minutiflora P. Beauv.) accumulates more biomass than do most other species of the herbaceous stratum vegetation native to the Cerrado. In this study, {{our aim was to}} determine the impact of M. minutiflora on native vegetation, as well as (using simulations of fire traits) on the characteristics of fires, in invaded areas of the Serra do Rola-Moça State Park (Parque Estadual da Serra do Rola-Moça, PESRM), a protected area where fires are frequent, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Our main results are that M. minutiflora considerably increases the amount of biomass, becoming the main combustible plant in the campo-cerrado (grassy-woody savanna) fires in the PESRM; that the native monocot biomass is inversely correlated with the M. minutiflora biomass, suggesting suppression of the native herbaceous stratum; that eudicots are diminished by M. minutiflora, both in number of individuals and number of species; and that fires are more severe in M. minutiflora-invaded areas...|$|E
40|$|In Güican (Boyacá), sheep {{production}} occupies {{one of the}} main items on the economy of the region, despite of being one of the largest, most relevant andimportant business, studies have not been developed to establish that is an efficient and sustainable business. For this reason a research was carried out in theFinca Ronces Güican, where two systems of grazing were temporarily implemented, an extensive traditional and rotational grazing. Forage present in thegrazing area were: <b>Molasses</b> <b>grass</b> (Melinis minutiflora), Kidney weed (Dichondra repens) and Dutch clover (Trifolium repens L); 24 creoles sheep were used persystem, selected according to age and sex, achieving uniformity in both groups used. The study was developed for 4 months in order to assess weight gain andprofitability, by assessing and weighing the animals every 15 days. These data were recorded and once the trial period finished, comparisons were made todetermine the effectiveness of each system. It was found that there is {{a significant difference between the}} two systems in terms of weight gain. In this way, in theconventional extensive system, sheep had a mean weight gain of 35. 47 g / day, while in the rotational system the average profit was 124. 24 g / day, so it wasconcluded that the rotational system is more profitable, since it has a return on capital of 8 % over the traditional extensive system...|$|E
30|$|The use of {{synthetic}} insecticides is effective {{to control the}} population of A. ípsilion, {{but in recent years}} it has been observed Pest´s resistance to some insecticides, in addition to the negative implications that come with constant use of insecticides ranging from water pollution and food contamination that can affect human health and the imbalance of the ecosystem [2]. Therefore, a pest control strategy that doesn’t attack environment has been studied. The intercropping is an important cultural practice in pest management as this is to diversify crops in a given agro-ecosystem to reduce the population of insects and consequently their attack [3, 4]. Studies indicate that intercropping protects the target plants using various mechanisms. Non-host plants involved in the mixture can emit volatile organic compounds which adversely affect the pest insects, giving thus some level of protection. This level of protection may involve the attraction of natural enemies of the pest insect or acts repelling the insect pest. For example, Khan et al. [5] observed that the intercropping with non-host plants such as <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> corn has significantly decreased the levels of infestation by stem borers and also increased larval parasitism of drills by Cotesia sesamiae. Volatile compounds produced by non-host plants repelled the insect pest, drill logs and even attracted the female parasitoid C. sesamiea. Landolt et al. [6] tested 27 essential oil extracts from 27 plants as a protective barrier against moth in fruit, and these consisted that the most effective repellents are garlic, Allium sativum L, Pogostemom cablin (Blanco) and Tanacetum vulgare L. These results suggest that the plant or plant oils may be used as a barrier against the fruit moth.|$|E
40|$|Introduced {{species may}} face very {{different}} environmental conditions {{in their new}} habitat compared to their original distribution. Phenotypic plasticity is one trait that may allow introduced species to spread into new habitats and outcompete native plants. This study assessed the role of phenotypic plasticity in the invasiveness of Melinis minutiflora (<b>molasses</b> <b>grass).</b> It is is a stoloniferous Poaceae native to sub-Saharan Africa currently spread across the tropics, displacing native species and changing fire regimes. Seedlings of M. minutiflora and native grass species were grown in pots with different irrigation, fertilization, light and competition regimes; biomass allocation {{was used as a}} phenotipic plasticity measurement. We did the experiment in Brazil by planting M. minutiflora with three native Aristida spp. and in Hawaii by planting it with three native Eragrostis spp. The potential distribution of M. minutiflora was evaluated in Brazil (Goiás state), Hawaii (Hawaii Island) and Tanzania (native habitat) as a measurement of environmental breadth. M. minutiflora populations may have low genetic diversity due to reproductive traits, in which case a wide environmental breadth could be attributed to phenotypic plasticity. The experiment in Brazil showed an impressive variation on root:shoot biomass ratio for M. minutiflora in two contrasting light conditions (0 % and 50 % shade, F(1, 142) = 323. 4, P<< 0. 001), with M. minutiflora always outcompeting the native species. The estimated potential distribution (BIOMOD ensemble model) showed that M. minutiflora may be able to occur in more than 60 % of the climate space (1950 to 2000 averages for temperature in the coolest month, annual rainfall and rainfall in the driest quarter, WORLDCLIM) found in each one of the studied regions. M. minutiflora's ability to vary its phenotype according to the environment and sustain a competitive superiority in all experimented situations may explain its wide distribution...|$|E

Os tratamentos estudados fazem parte de um experimento com plantas da variedade Hamlin sôbre laranjeira caipira (Citrus sinensis Osbeck) instalodo no Estação Experimental de Limeira, do Instituto Agronômico. Amostras de fôlhas do ciclo vegetativo da primavera foram colhidas a intervalos regulares, desde outubro de 1957 a março de 1959 e analisadas para os seguintes elementos: N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe e Mn. São apresentados os tendências das curvas de concentração dos elementos nutritivos nas fôlhas e os resultados de produção correspondentes a quatro onos de colheita. Como observação mais importante foi verificado que a cobertura morta de capim e a adubação verde de mucuna aumentaram de modo sensível o teor de fósforo nas fôlhas dos citros. As produções de laranja acompanharam a ordem dos níveis dêsse elemento na folhagem. The {{influence}} of several soil management systems on the mineral nutrition {{and production of}} citrus trees was studied. This study was mode in an experimental orchard installed in 1949 with Hamlin orange on sweet orange (Citrus sinensis Osbeck). Differential treatments were started in 1953. Since 1956 all plots received uniform fertilizer applications and liming. The cultural treatments employed are as follows: clean cultivation with herbicide; clean cultivation plus a cover crop of velvet bean (Stizolobium aterrimum Pip. & Trac.) planted {{in the spring and}} cut down in the fall; clean cultivation plus a cover crop of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) planted in the spring and cut down in the fall; <b>molasses</b> <b>grass</b> (Melinis minutiflora Béauv.) mulch; and superficial soil plowing. Leaf samples of the spring cycle were collected from each treatment at regular intervals, from October, 1957 to March, 1959, and analysed for N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, and Mn. The seasonal variations in mineral composition of the leaves were studied in relation to the crop harvest in 1958. Grass-mulched plots showed low level of nitrogen in the leaves in comparison with those which did not receive this treatment. Therefore, extra nitrogen fertilizer may be required to prevent competition for nitrogen due to mulching practices in citrus orchards. Mulched plots produced the highest yields every year, followed by clean cultivation plus cover crop of velvet bean, while clean-cultivated plots produced the lowest. Orange yields and leaf phosphorus levels showed similar trends. From this evidence it seems reasonable a preference for cultural practices which enable the trees to accumulate phosphorus. Mulch and lime as dolomitic limestone used together increased calcium and magnesium absorption by trees, so decreasing the probability of a magnesium deficiency os a result of the large amount of potassium made available by the mulch decomposition. I ron and manganese absorption by trees decreased in the mulched plots. The low levels of leaf iron were quite consistent in this treatment throughout the seasons. Clean cultivation plus a cover crop of velvet bean seems to be a promising cultural practice for citrus, regarding the increased orange yields and the low cost of its installation. The economics use of mulch, assuming the amount of grass required, is limited to the cost in obtaining mulching material...|$|E
