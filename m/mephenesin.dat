50|$|Wu M.F. et al. {{studied the}} nucleus raphes dorsalis as it pertained to {{narcolepsy}}. This is logical, as the raphe nuclei {{have been known}} {{to play a role in}} the sleep/wake cycle. Cataplexy is the symptom of narcolepsy when full awareness of the environment is maintained, but all muscle tone is lost. This has thought to be a dissociation of what normally happens during REM sleep, when all muscle tone is lost except for the eyes. The nucleus raphes dorsalis {{have been known to}} project to the lateral hypothalamus, along with the locus coeruleus and the tuberomammillary nucleus. The neurotransmitters of these three aforementioned nuclei, which project to the lateral hypothalamus, are serotonin, norepinephrine and histamine respectively. These neurotransmitters are fully active during waking hours, partially active during non-REM sleep, and have almost ceased during REM sleep. In cats with pontine lesions, their normal atonia is not present, the raphe dorsalis is fully active, as opposed to the cessation of action under normal conditions. A muscle relaxant, known as <b>Mephenesin,</b> reduces to activity of the dorsal nucleus, as well as microinjections of carbachol (which induces atonia while awake).|$|E

The psychiatric mechanisms of action of these drugs were not known {{at the time and}} these were initially called major tranquilizers (now typical antipsychotics) due to their induction of [...] "euphoric quietude"; minor tranquilizers (now benzodiazepines) and psychic energizers (now antidepressants) due to patients [...] "dancing in the wards." [...] These compounds were developed during a period of growth for the pharmaceutical industry bolstered by the 1951 Durham-Humphrey Amendment, giving physicians monopolistic prescribing rights thus aligning the interests of physicians and pharmaceutical companies. This also followed the industry's development of [...] "magic bullets" [...] that treat people with, for example, diabetes, which according to Whitaker provided an analogy to sell the idea of these drugs to the public. It was not until many years later, after the mechanisms of these drugs were determined, that the serotonergic hypothesis of depression and dopaminergic hypothesis of schizophrenia were developed to fall in line with the drug's mechanisms.

40|$|Since {{the early}} studies of Berger and Bradley (1946) {{describing}} the skeletal muscle relaxing properties of <b>mephenesin,</b> 3 -(O-niethylphenoxyl) - 1, 2 -propanediol, presumably through its {{action on the}} central nervous system, {{a large number of}} chemical agents have been prepared with the intention of simulating tlue pharmacological ac-tion of this agent. Early clinical observations in-dicated that <b>mephenesin</b> was of therapeutic value in abolishing abnormal muscle tone and involun-tary movement without impairing normal neuro-muscular function. This agent has several short-comings, among which are its short duration of action and its obvious lack of potency. Subse-quent to the discovery of <b>mephenesin</b> a number of drugs have been described pharmacologically which in some respects are improvements over this drug. Tluus, in 1952, Dresel and Slater reported, largely on the basis of electroshock studies, that <b>mephenesin</b> carbamate 2 (3 -O-toloxy- 1, 2 -propane-diol- 1 -carbamate) was more potent and longer act-ing than <b>mephenesin.</b> Berger (1954) described the central relaxant properties of meprobamate 3 (2 -metluyl- 2 -n-propyl- 1, 3 -propanediol dicarbamate).

Differential actions of morphine and methadone on hindlimb reflexes in spinal animals have been reported by Wikler (1944, 1945) and Wilder and Frank (1948). These observers also noted that barbiturates had only progressive de-pressant actions on such reflexes. Also, other investigators (Henneman, Kaplan and IJnna, 1949; Kaada, 1950) have described differential actions of <b>mephenesin</b> on spinal reflexes. It appeared possible, therefore, that analgesic, hypnotic and paralytic agents might be differentiated readily by their effects on hindlimb re-flexes in chronic spinal animals, provided the effects of varying doses, and vary-ing routes and rates of administration of these drugs were known.

40|$|The mephenesin-like {{properties}} {{of a series}} of benzazoles have recently been reported (Domino et al., 1952). These drugs, like <b>mephenesin,</b> glyketal, apo-beta-erythroidine, benzimidazole, and diethyl 1, 3 -propanediol (Prenderol) cause a reversible flaccid paralysis which is not curare-like, as they do not block the neuromyal junction. Respiration is not impaired unless exceedingly large doses of the drugs are given (Breckenridge et al., 1950). The knee jerk and other rapid reflexes are retained while the withdrawal response is abolished. It has been suggested that the primary action of the benzazoles is depression of spinal inter-nuncial activity (Funderburk et al., 1953). Although benzimidazole, Prenderol, glyketal and apo-beta-erythroidine re-semble <b>mephenesin</b> in their action at the spinal level, there is evidence that their effects on higher centers may differ.

40|$|Transmission {{through the}} cat {{superior}} cervical ganglion was studied by recording {{the response of}} the nictitating membrane to both pre- and postganglionic cervical sympathetic nerve stimulation. The intra-arterial injection of central depressant drugs to the ganglion through the lingual artery depressed transmission through the ganglion. The central depressant drugs tested were (in decreasing order of activity) : amylobarbitone, pentobarbitone, carbromal, benactyzine, mephobarbitone, hydroxyzine, phenobarbitone, azacyclonol, methylpentynol carbamate, paraldehyde, phenytoin, <b>mephenesin,</b> chlorbutol, troxidone, methylpentynol and barbitone.

The intra-arterial injection of the central stimulant drugs leptazol, bemegride, amiphenazole and 5 -(1, 3 -dimethylbut- 2 -enyl) - 5 -ethylbarbituric acid (McN 481) also depressed ganglionic transmission. Leptazol or bemegride did not antagonize the ganglion-blocking action of amylobarbitone or troxidone.

40|$|Soon {{after the}} {{pharmacological}} properties of <b>mephenesin</b> were described an extensive investigation was undertaken {{to determine which}} part of the molecule {{was responsible for the}} paralyzing action of the drug (Berger, 1948). During the course of this investigation, {{it was found that the}} substitution of the oxygen of the ether linkage by an-NH- group (3 -p-toluidino- 1, 2 -propanediol) gave a compound which was devoid of paralyzing activity but possessed convulsant properties. This clue was followed up and additional substituted amino propanols prepared and tested for convulsant action. The present paper describes the analeptic and convulsant. properties of a compound which has proved out-standing in this respect-, 1 -n-butylamino- 3 -p-t-oluidino- 2 -propanol, called W 181.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of hypothalamic injection of various drugs on the skeletal muscles, as well as blood pressure, hear rate and the peripheral blood vessels. Their central action is discussed. 1. Results of the experiments have shown that the drugs can be divided into the following groups according to their action on the circulatory system : a. Those which produce an elevation of blood pressure, an increase in heart rate, and peripheral vasoconstriction (adrenalin, atropine and vitacamphor). b. Those which produce an elevation of blood pressure and peripheral vasoconstriction, but a decrease in heart rate (acetylcholine and vagostigmine). c. Those which produce a transient fall of blood pressure followed by its elevation, and which have no effect on heart rate (picrotoxin and strychnine). d. Those which produce a marked elevation of blood pressure and a marked increase in heart rate, with no definite action on the peripheral blood vessels (urethane and phenobarbital). e. Those which produce a fall of blood pressure, with little action on heart rate or the peripheral blood vessels (<b>mephenesin</b> and d-tubocurarine). 2. The effect of hypothalamic injection of phenol, caffeine, picrotoxin, strychnine, d-tubocurarine, tetraethylammonium and <b>mephenesin</b> on the tonus of the skeletal muscles was determined by estimating the degree of tonus and the change in the action potential of the gastrocnemius. All the drugs used, with the single exception of <b>mephenesin,</b> produced convulsion and an increase in spontaneous discharge of the gastrocnemius. Blocking of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves had little effect in counteracting this action of the drugs. Administration of anesthetics, however, produced abatement or disappearance of the phenomena.
