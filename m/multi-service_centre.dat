40|$|Objectives: This study {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} three types of living arrangements, namely living alone, living with family, {{and living in a}} hostel, and the psychological wellbeing of older people in Hong Kong. The impact of various sociodemographic factors on the choice of living arrangements of older people was also studied. Methods: Ninety healthy Hong Kong Chinese were recruited from four <b>multi-service</b> <b>centres</b> and one hostel. An individual interview was conducted with each participant and the General Health Questionnaire- 12 and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale- 10 were administered. Results: The results suggested that the psychological wellbeing of older people living in hostels was better than that of older people living alone, but that the psychological well-being of older people living with their family was not different from that of older people living alone. Conclusion: That the psychological well-being of older people in different living arrangements is different may be explained by the differences in time for leisure, access to social services, as well as changes in their attitude towards co-residence with children...|$|R

Its initiatives include ramping up the facilities and providing health and personal care services at the Salvation Army Bedok <b>Multi-Service</b> <b>Centre</b> (Bedok MSC). [...] The improved facilities, enhanced services, and extended operating hours (7am-7pm) would then allow family members to continue work {{during the day and}} care for the elderly during the evenings and weekends. A multi-disciplinary team comprising nurses, therapists, case managers and health workers was formed to look after the care needs of the elderly. The team works closely with the patient’s primary physician and helps to coordinate other services that are not available in-house. The elderly who participate in the {{pilot programme}} receive meals and take part in supervised exercise and recreation activities in addition to medical and nursing care.|$|E
50|$|MINDS runs: 4 Special Education SchoolsThe 4 MINDS schools offer four {{programs}}; Pre-School, Junior, Senior and Special {{programs for}} pupils who have Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD), and are severely disabled intellectually or have challenging behaviours. The curriculum is tailored {{to suit the}} special needs of individual children and {{the focus is on the}} functional needs of the pupils for the present and the future. Areas of learning include language communication, functional academics such as time telling, money value, self-help skills and personal grooming, social competency and pre-vocational skills. To promote the holistic development of pupils, the schools have within their curriculum time, physical education, music and swimming. A multidisciplinary team of Allied Health Professionals in each school, such as psychologists, social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech therapists, ensures a holistic approach to the development of pupils and support for their families.3 Employment and Development Centres (EDCs)The Employment Development Centres continuously seek to increase their diversity of contract work, in-house industries, social enterprises and job placements into open employment for persons with intellectual disability. These efforts go towards providing income for the trainees to pay for their own transport, food and leisure. But more importantly, with jobs to do, persons with intellectual disability can hold their heads high in society as ‘contributors’.6 Training and Development Centres (TDCs)The Training and Development Centres service clients with more challenging behaviours, or have a greater degree of special needs that require continuous professional help. Extensive training is provided through a multi-disciplinary team to modify behaviours and improve independent living skills so that some may eventually be transferred to sheltered workshops or even prepared for open employment.2 Residential Homes (one for adults, one for children) + 1 Hostel/Group Home (for adults)MINDSville@Napiri is a <b>multi-service</b> <b>centre</b> in Lorong Napiri run by MINDS.

Club) & Home-Based Care ServicesMe Too! Club is a programme to enhance the social integration of people with intellectual disabilities (PWIDs) through leisure and befriending activities. It is best suited for PWIDs who cannot participate in community-based services due to health reasons and/or other reasons or would prefer a less intensive programme. Me Too! Club offers age-appropriate activities that cater to the interests of persons with moderate to severe intellectual disabilities.1 Appropriate Adult (AA) programmeThe Appropriate Adult (AA) Service provides support to Singapore Police Force (SPF), Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) and Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) during the investigating interviews involving detainees, victims or witnesses suspected of having Intellectual Disability, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and/or Mental Health issues.The role of the Appropriate Adult is not to provide legal advice to the police detainee/suspect/witness. Their role is to act as a bridge between the Investigation Officer and the police detainee/suspect/witness to enable him/her to communicate more effectively during the police interview. This means that the police detainee/suspect/witness does not misunderstand the questions asked or that he/she is not misunderstood by the Investigation Officer, ensuring that statements recorded are reliable.All applicants will have to attend a mandatory one-day training session and selection process. Training sessions will be held depending on demand, and the dates will be publicised.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years, we have {{observed}} a sub-urbanization process or “sprawl” process (low density of inhabitants), caused by new economic and production conditions, a new pattern of social relationships and {{the widespread use}} of private car for travelling. Commuters need to reach quickly their own destinations and the traffic-related problems in central areas require multimodal platforms as nodes of an integrated transport system to foster car-public transport interchange. The optimal location and design of modal shift nodes, for potential users involved in multimodal transfers within an urban or metropolitan context, {{is one of the most}} important issues in transport system planning. Several methods have been developed to deal with this topic. The basic idea is to locate such nodes in areas of adequate size, well connected to the road network and public transit in order to minimise the time required for the transfer, taking into account the variation of transport demand under the various steps of decision-making process (generation, distribution, mode and route choice). The aim of the proposed research is to tackle the aforesaid planning issue through a methodological approach focusing on a land use-related aspect: the attractiveness of such 2 modal shift nodes in relation to their potential territorial role as providers of several services other than mobility-related utilities. In particular, the metropolitan area of Palermo and its outskirts, which is taking the connotation of an expanded city, will be an interesting case study to test for the goodness of the proposed methodology. The results showed in this paper define the criteria for the optimal location of intermodal nodes within a context characterized by a dispersed urban area composed of many municipalities, based on also the role that can be played by each node as <b>multi-service</b> <b>centre</b> affecting passenger travel behaviour. Furthermore, the paper describes the modelling framework we are going to apply...|$|E

Through a review of the different care services provided by Christian Care Services in Hong Kong over the past decades, and a n insight into the ethos behind such services, the different elements of service and leadership competencies including knowledge, skills, values, communication and attitudes were introduced to our students. An experiential approach has been adopted in which students were given opportunities to put what they have learned from the lectures through serving the elderly in the two host organizations mentioned above. Through the process of (1) understanding the need s of groups to be served, (2) planning the activities deemed beneficial to the target group, (3) delivering the services according to the plan, and (4) an evaluation of the result of the services together with a reflection of one 2 ̆ 7 s attitude and motivation, these experiences should bring about an impact on the students, enhancing their service attitude and social concern for the needy. The impact was assessed through a questionnaire which the students filled in in the first week and {{towards the end of the}} course. Although there was no examination in the course, students were assessed based on their group discussion and role play, performance in service delivery, group presentation and individual reports on the two services. A course manual was also prepared and each student given a copy to encourage self-reflection and peer evaluation. It is envisaged that the course would have an impact on our students in areas of citizenship, communication and problem-solving of the Graduate Attributes advocated by HKBU...|$|E
