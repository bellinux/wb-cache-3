[...] But I don't think Danny was surprised. [...] Danny never blinked. At no point did he show any feeling {{that it was going to}} be anything but amazing. [...] And he was right." ...|$|E
500|$|The deeper {{waters of}} the Tennessee River allowed the Timberlake {{expedition}} to proceed much more quickly. A hunting party led by the Cherokee chief Slave Catcher met the Timberlake expedition {{near the mouth of}} the Little Tennessee River, and supplied the weary expedition with provisions of [...] "dried venison, homminy, and boiled corn." [...] The following day, Slave Catcher guided the expedition by canoe up the Little Tennessee, although the Timberlake party struggled to keep up. Timberlake recalled, [...] "my hands were so galled, that the blood trickled from them, and when we set out the next <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> scarce able to handle a pole." [...] The Timberlake party arrived in the Overhill town of Tomotley on December 20, where they were greeted by the town's head man, Chief Ostenaco.|$|E

Sitting around a log fire at Byron's villa, the company amused themselves with German ghost stories, which prompted Byron to propose that they [...] "each write a ghost story". Unable {{to think of a}} story, young Mary Godwin became anxious: [...] "Have you thought of a story? I was asked each morning, and each <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> forced to reply with a mortifying negative." [...] During one mid-June evening, the discussions turned {{to the nature of the}} principle of life. [...] "Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated", Mary noted, [...] "galvanism had given token of such things". It was after midnight before they retired, and unable to sleep, she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the grim terrors of her [...] "waking dream", her ghost story: ...|$|E

500|$|Her Jewish {{upbringing}} {{was influenced}} by her devoutly Orthodox Jewish maternal grandmother. Barr's parents kept their Jewish heritage secret from their neighbors and were partially involved in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Barr has stated, [...] "Friday, Saturday, and Sunday <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a Jew; Sunday afternoon, Tuesday afternoon, and Wednesday afternoon we were Mormons". [...] When Barr was three years old, she got Bell's palsy {{on the left side}} of her face. Barr said, [...] " [...] my mother called in a rabbi to pray for me, but nothing happened. Then my mother got a Mormon preacher, he prayed, and I was miraculously cured". Years later Barr learned that Bell's palsy was usually temporary and that the Mormon preacher came [...] "exactly at the right time". [...] At six years old, Barr discovered her first public stage by lecturing at LDS churches around Utah and even was elected president of a Mormon youth group.|$|E
500|$|... "Monkey Gone to Heaven"'s main {{theme is}} environmentalism. The song mainly deals with man's {{destruction}} {{of the ocean and}} [...] "confusion of man's place in the universe". [...] "On one hand, it's [...] this big organic toilet. Things get flushed and repurified or decomposed and it's this big, dark, mysterious place", Black later said, [...] "It's also a very mythological place where there are octopus's gardens, the Bermuda Triangle, Atlantis, and mermaids." [...] Francis came up with the song's hook, [...] "this monkey's gone to heaven", long before the song itself was written. The line itself forms a basis for the song, which revolves around man's relationship with the divine and environmentalism. After Francis set the developing lyrics to music, he rushed to lead guitarist Joey Santiago's apartment to play it to him. Santiago later commented on the nascent performance: [...] "It was early in the <b>morning,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> still so tired. [...] 'Hey Joe, I need to come over. I need to show you something.' [...] It was awesome, really good. He had the 'If man is five' part there, and he was laughing. [...] It was hilarious".|$|E

Even if he had opted to go immediately to the United States to play hockey, compulsory military service kept Niittymäki in Finland until January 2001. He would return to TPS in 2012 for his final season, playing 14 games.|$|E

2500|$|Bow was her parents' third child, but her {{two older}} sisters, born in 1903 and 1904, {{had died in}} infancy. Her mother, Sarah Frances Bow (née Gordon, 1880–1923), was told by a doctor not to become {{pregnant}} again, for fear the next baby might die, as well. Despite the warning, Sarah became pregnant with Clara in late 1904. In addition to the risky pregnancy, a heat wave besieged New York in July 1905, and temperatures peaked around [...] Years later, Clara said: [...] "I don't suppose two people ever looked death in the face more clearly than my mother and I the <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born. We were both given up, but somehow we struggled back to life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dissatisfied {{with the}} results of her efforts, Nation began to pray to God for direction. On June 5, 1900, she felt she {{received}} her answer {{in the form of a}} heavenly vision. As she described it:The next <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> awakened by a voice which seemed to me speaking in my heart, these words, [...] "GO TO KIOWA," [...] and my hands were lifted and thrown down and the words, [...] "I'LL STAND BY YOU." [...] The words, [...] "Go to Kiowa," [...] were spoken in a murmuring, musical tone, low and soft, but [...] "I'll stand by you," [...] was very clear, positive and emphatic. I was impressed with a great inspiration, the interpretation was very plain, it was this: [...] "Take something in your hands, and throw at these places in Kiowa and smash them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carolyn's second child, Betty Jessop, turned {{eighteen}} in 2007 {{and returned}} to the FLDS. As was acknowledged by both parties, Carolyn had to physically force her to leave the FLDS when she was thirteen. Since returning to the FLDS, Betty has openly disputed the claims in Carolyn's book, particularly those alleging that Merril Jessop was abusive, saying [...] "it just makes me want to laugh." [...] She describes her years outside of the sect as traumatic, explaining that public school was a shock and that the task of caring for her siblings fell to her due to her mother's health problems: [...] "With the responsibility landing on me so hard every <b>morning,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> an emotional wreck, and after a while, I hardened into a frazzled bundle of nerves." [...] She added, [...] "I was such a representation of everything [...] hated so much. I just couldn't deny what was in my heart -- my belief in my religion and my love for my father and my family. I spent four years , and there is nothing there for me." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1940 he got {{the lead}} role in Rodgers and Hart's Pal Joey, again choreographed by Robert Alton. This role {{propelled}} him to stardom. During its run he told reporters: [...] "I don't believe in conformity to any school of dancing. I create what the drama and the music demand. While I am a hundred percent for ballet technique, I use only what I can adapt to my own use. I never let technique {{get in the way}} of mood or continuity." [...] His colleagues at this time noticed his great commitment to rehearsal and hard work. Van Johnson—who also appeared in Pal Joey—recalled: [...] "I watched him rehearsing, and it seemed to me that there was no possible room for improvement. Yet he wasn't satisfied. It was midnight and we had been rehearsing since eight in the <b>morning.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> making my way sleepily down the long flight of stairs when I heard staccato steps coming from the stage...I could see just a single lamp burning. Under it, a figure was dancing...Gene." ...|$|E
