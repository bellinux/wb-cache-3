According to {{the vehicle}} braking {{efficiency}} road test rules in GB 7258, the braking efficiency on-line monitoring index, parameter, method and threshold are studied. <b>Mean</b> <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>deceleration</b> (MFDD) is selected as the evaluation index. Pitch angle {{which is used to}} monitor the road slope(less than 1 %) is collected by gyroscope. Vehicle maximum deceleration is collected at the period of ABS working, which {{is to make sure that}} the road adhesion coefficient is more than 0. 7. Vehicle maximum braking deceleration is analyzed, and it is used to exclude driving on pit, decelerating band, road step, even crash and so on. The rapid stop is identified with brake pedal travel senor. MFDD is calculated with braking deceleration and wheel speed, and wheel speed is collected from ABS with can bus. MFDD threshold is determined with passenger capacity monitoring with card reader. Finally, the method of vehicle braking efficiency on-line monitoring and evaluation with MFDD is given...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{comprehensive}} and rationality of examination for driving braking performance with <b>Mean</b> <b>Fully</b> <b>Developed</b> <b>Deceleration</b> (MFDD) in road test, also to {{provide a basis for}} driving braking performance evaluation with MFDD when real driving, an approach for determining the MFDD threshold is proposed considering initial braking velocity and passenger capacity. According to the vehicle braking performance road test rules in GB 7258, a simulation model is built, and simulation tests are made with different initial braking velocities. Based on simulation data, MFDD is calculated, and the curve of MFDD with initial braking velocity is also given, and then the effects of initial braking velocity on MFDD and its threshold are analyzed; the curves of MFDD thresholds with initial braking velocity are plotted with no-load and full-load respectively. The influence of passenger capacity on MFDD threshold is analyzed, and the curve of MFDD threshold with passenger capacity is given, too. Finally, the formula of MFDD threshold with initial braking velocity, seating capacity and passenger capacity is resulted...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies by}} the Cambridge Vehicle Dynamics Consortium (CVDC) have {{suggested}} that, by improving the control bandwidth of conventional Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) brake actuators and using a ‘slip control’ braking strategy, HGV stopping distances could be reduced by up to 30 % over existing systems. The work covered in this thesis looks to: validate the CVDC’s previous braking performance predictions through Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) simulation, investigate how in-plane tyre dynamics may influence such a system’s performance, develop and build a next generation high-bandwidth braking system for vehicle implementation and carry out comparative back-to-back vehicle tests between the new system and commercially available HGV ABS. An introduction to HGV brake hardware and control is presented in Chapter 1. This is followed by straight-line braking simulations of a HGV using a HiL test rig in Chapter 2. In these tests, a conventional ABS is compared to a prototype braking system consisting of highspeed pneumatic valves (designed by a previous CVDC researcher) and a sliding mode slip controller. Results indicate that the novel system could reduce stopping distances and air consumption by 21 % and 17 % respectively. Chapter 3 considers the influence of longitudinal tyre dynamics on the straight-line braking performance of a HGV slip control system. A novel, HGV specific, dynamic tyre model is presented. Two vibration modes involving the tyre tread band and wheel hub (an in-phase mode at 20 Hz, and an anti-phase mode at 55 Hz) are identified that can influence {{the performance of a}} slip control system. It is shown that a gain scheduled sliding mode slip controller can be designed to be robust to oscillations in wheel speed associated with these modes. Overspinning of the wheel hub during brake release (a phenomenon seen in conventional ABS vehicle test data) is also correctly predicted by the novel tyre model. Chapter 4 focuses on the design of a next generation high-speed ABS modulator valve suitable for installation on a test vehicle. Prototype valve blocks are built and shown to meet the requirements of a typical UK semi-trailer. Frequency response tests with the new valves indicate that the system can achieve a pressure control bandwidth of 10 Hz, significantly higher than the previous generation high-speed valve system (6 Hz) and conventional ABS hardware (1. 5 Hz). Chapter 5 discusses the installation of high-speed ABS modulator valves on a tri-axle semi-trailer. Straight-line braking tests are then carried out in Chapter 6 – comparing the new valve system with conventional ABS. On average, stopping distance and air use are reduced by 15 ± 3 % and 50 ± 10 % respectively. An increase in <b>Mean</b> <b>Fully</b> <b>Developed</b> <b>Deceleration</b> (MFDD) of 16 ± 4 % is also achieved by the new system...|$|E

30|$|Now {{that the}} law {{applicable}} during NIAC is in a more (though by no <b>means</b> <b>fully)</b> <b>developed</b> state, the primary issue to be addressed is how to ensure that NSAGs comply with the relevant norms and {{close the gap between}} law and practice during NIAC. Aligning the practice of NSAGs with the legal standards is an extremely challenging task, however. On the one hand, NSAGs may not be aware of the existence or meaning of humanitarian norms and may lack the institutional structure to ensure compliance of their own fighters (Ryngaert and Van de Meulebroucke 2012, 456 – 457). Alternatively, a NSAG may be unwilling to engage with the notion that it has legal obligations under humanitarian law (e.g. ICRC 2008). Even those NSAGs willing to abide by the laws may encounter an array of obstacles in implementing them. 8 It {{is for this reason that}} organisations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross have engaged with NSAGs that have expressed a desire for help. Nonetheless, as Ryngaert and Van de Meulebroucke note, unlike for states, there is no formal advisory service available to NSAGs struggling to comply (Ryngaert and Van de Meulebroucke 2012, 457).|$|R

30|$|Although {{the linear}} {{growth rate of}} the Rayleigh-Taylor {{instability}} {{appears to be a}} good index of the plasma bubble occurrence, a high R-T growth rate does not necessarily <b>mean</b> a <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> EPB structure. Even if the R-T growth rate becomes high instantaneously, EPBs do not grow unless a high R-T growth rate continues for 1 or 2  h. It is also likely that an EPB is produced somewhere else and drifts into the observation site. As studied by Ajith et al. (2015), {{there are two types of}} EPBs: evolving-type EPBs and drifting-in EPBs, suggesting that EPBs can be observed even if the R-T growth rate is low.|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} {{concern for}} both regulators {{and the public}} at large regarding the large-scale application of on-shore geological carbon dioxide (CO 2) sequestration is related to possible health risks due to the leakage of CO 2 at surface. Development and "proof of concept" of the automated geochemical monitoring station during research is seen as an important step forward in providing tools that help in assuring {{the public at large}} about the safety of geological CO 2 sequestration. The advances in microchip technology, portable analytical instrumentation, and decreasing prices <b>means</b> that, once <b>fully</b> <b>developed,</b> a significant number of these relatively low cost stations might be deployed above an injection site to monitor CO 2 leaks. These might be particularly useful if placed around any deep wells that penetrate the reservoir or deep aquifer in which CO 2 is being injected, as gas injection tests have shown how breakthrough of monitored gases is often first observed {{in the vicinity of the}} injection borehole, implying that fracturing during drilling provided preferential flow pathways. Preliminary data provided by the development and installation of a prototype automated geochemical-geophysical monitoring station in the San Vittorino area has shown that this technology exists and that it can provide, together with other techniques, a useful tool for the safety assessment and monitoring of geological sequestration sites. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|During the {{development}} of a new car model the manufacturer usually has to redesign subassemblies in order to attain higher reliability levels. Being new subassemblies mainly evolutionary instead of revolutionary, the Bayesian approach allows to combine corporate memory, expert testimony and experimental data in order to obtain realistic (and not optimistic) reliability assessment for the new model. Because of this specific advantage the Bayesian approach is now adopted in automotive industry, in spite of the difficulty in establishing prior and in managing the results of the Bayes theorem. Actually the sources of knowledge to be fused into the Bayes "melting pot" are: a) the corporate data bank, which provides the record of the number of failures occurred to the old version of the subassembly during the warranty period; b) the testimony of design engineer, who has a sound opinion about the expected reliability improvement due to his design revisions; c) the hard data, which are collected through life tests on the new version. In this paper, the authors present a Bayesian procedure to assess the reliability of a new car subassembly by <b>means</b> of a <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> case study, which concerns {{the development}} of a revised version of a specific subassembly by means of a suitable quality improvement program.
