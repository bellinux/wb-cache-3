5|$|Organometallic {{compounds}} {{by definition}} contain {{at least one}} carbon-metal bond. A wide range of such compounds exist; major classes include simple alkyl-metal compounds (for example, tetraethyllead), η-alkene compounds (for example, Zeise's salt), and η-allyl compounds (for example, allylpalladium chloride dimer); metallocenes containing cyclopentadienyl ligands (for example, ferrocene); and transition metal carbene complexes. Many <b>metal</b> <b>carbonyls</b> exist (for example, tetracarbonylnickel); some workers consider the carbon monoxide ligand to be purely inorganic, and not organometallic.|$|E
5|$|Cerium(IV) aqueous {{solutions}} may {{be prepared}} by reacting cerium(III) solutions {{with the strong}} oxidising agents peroxodisulfate or bismuthate. The value of E⦵(Ce4+/Ce3+) varies widely depending on conditions due to the relative ease of complexation and hydrolysis with various anions, though +1.72V is a usually representative value; that for E⦵(Ce3+/Ce) is −2.34V. Cerium is the only lanthanide which has important aqueous and coordination chemistry in the +4 oxidation state. Due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer, aqueous cerium(IV) ions are orange-yellow. Aqueous cerium(IV) is metastable in water and is a strong oxidising agent that oxidizes hydrochloric acid to give chlorine gas. For example, ceric ammonium nitrate is a common oxidising agent in organic chemistry, releasing organic ligands from <b>metal</b> <b>carbonyls.</b> In the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, cerium oscillates between the +4 and +3 oxidation states to catalyse the reaction. Cerium(IV) salts, especially cerium(IV) sulfate, are often used as standard reagents for volumetric analysis in cerimetric titrations.|$|E
5|$|Being the {{smallest}} alkali metal, lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds, which are bonded covalently. Organolithium compounds are electrically non-conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures, {{and tend to}} form oligomers with the structure (RLi)x where R is the organic group. As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom, effectively creating a carbanion, organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. For use as bases, butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available. An example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium ((CH3Li)x), which exists in tetrameric (x = 4, tetrahedral) and hexameric (x = 6, octahedral) forms. Organolithium compounds, especially n-butyllithium, are useful reagents in organic synthesis, {{as might be expected}} given lithium's diagonal relationship with magnesium, which {{plays an important role in}} the Grignard reaction. For example, alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may be used to synthesise aldehydes and ketones by reaction with <b>metal</b> <b>carbonyls.</b> The reaction with nickel tetracarbonyl, for example, proceeds through an unstable acyl nickel carbonyl complex which then undergoes electrophilic substitution to give the desired aldehyde (using H+ as the electrophile) or ketone (using an alkyl halide) product.|$|E
5000|$|A further {{synthetic}} route is {{the reaction of}} the <b>metal</b> <b>carbonyl</b> with hydrogen. [...] The protonation of <b>metal</b> <b>carbonyl</b> anions, e.g. Co(CO)4−, leads also to the formation of <b>metal</b> <b>carbonyl</b> hydrides.|$|R

25|$|The {{conversion}} of CO to alkanes involves hydrogenation of CO, the hydrogenolysis (cleavage with H2) of C–O bonds, {{and the formation}} of C–C bonds. Such reactions are assumed to proceed via initial formation of surface-bound <b>metal</b> <b>carbonyls.</b> The CO ligand is speculated to undergo dissociation, possibly into oxide and carbide ligands. Other potential intermediates are various C1 fragments including formyl (CHO), hydroxycarbene (HCOH), hydroxymethyl (CH2OH), methyl (CH3), methylene (CH2), methylidyne (CH), and hydroxymethylidyne (COH). Furthermore, and critical to the production of liquid fuels, are reactions that form C–C bonds, such as migratory insertion. Many related stoichiometric reactions have been simulated on discrete metal clusters, but homogeneous Fischer–Tropsch catalysts are poorly developed and of no commercial importance.|$|E
500|$|People can {{be exposed}} to nickel in the {{workplace}} by inhalation, ingestion, and contact with skin or eye. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for the workplace at 1mg/m3 per 8-hour workday, excluding nickel carbonyl. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) specifies the recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.015mg/m3 per 8-hour workday. At 10mg/m3, nickel is immediately dangerous to life and health. Nickel carbonyl [...] is an extremely toxic gas. The toxicity of <b>metal</b> <b>carbonyls</b> {{is a function of}} both the toxicity of the metal and the off-gassing of carbon monoxide from the carbonyl functional groups; nickel carbonyl is also explosive in air.|$|E

500|$|Technetium forms {{a variety}} of {{compounds}} with Tc–C bonds, i.e. organotechnetium complexes. [...] Prominent members of this class are complexes with CO, arene, and cyclopentadienyl ligands. [...] The binary carbonyl Tc2(CO)10 is a white volatile solid. In this molecule, two technetium atoms are bound to each other; each atom is surrounded by octahedra of five carbonyl ligands. The bond length between technetium atoms, 303pm, is significantly larger than the distance between two atoms in metallic technetium (272pm). Similar carbonyls are formed by technetium's congeners, manganese and rhenium. [...] Interest in organotechnetium compounds has also been motivated by applications in nuclear medicine.

500|$|Discoveries in {{organometallic}} chemistry {{have led}} to important insights into chemical bonding. Zeise's salt, K·H2O, was reported in 1831 and Mond's discovery of Ni(CO)4 occurred in 1888. Each contained a bond between a metal centre and small molecule, ethylene {{in the case of}} Zeise's salt and carbon monoxide in the case of nickel tetracarbonyl. The space-filling model of the anion of Zeise's salt (image at left) shows direct bonding between the platinum metal centre (shown in blue) and the carbon atoms (shown in black) of the ethylene ligand; such metal–carbon bonds are the defining characteristic of organometallic species. Bonding models were unable to explain the nature of such metal–alkene bonds until the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model was proposed in the 1950s. The original formulation covered only metal–alkene bonds but the model was expanded over time to cover systems like <b>metal</b> <b>carbonyls</b> (including [...] ) where π backbonding is important.|$|E

2500|$|Usually, {{organometallic}} compounds {{are considered to}} contain the M-C-H group. [...] The metal (M) in these species can either be a main group element or a transition metal.

2500|$|CAN is {{traditionally}} used to release organic ligands from <b>metal</b> <b>carbonyls.</b> [...] In the process, the metal is oxidised, CO is evolved, and the organic ligand is released for further manipulation.

50|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>carbonyl</b> hydride {{are used}} as {{catalysts}} in the hydroformylation of olefins. Under industrial conditions the catalyst is usually formed in situ in a reaction of a metal salt precursor with the syngas. The hydroformylation starts with the generation of a coordinatively unsaturated 16-electron <b>metal</b> <b>carbonyl</b> hydride complex like HCo(CO)3 or HRh(CO)(PPh3)2 by dissociation of a ligand. Such complexes bind olefins in a first step via π-complexation. In a second step an alkyl complex is formed by insertion of the olefin into the metal-hydrogen bond, leading once again to a 16-electron species. This complex can bind another carbon monoxide, which can insert into the metal-carbon bond of the alkyl ligand to form an acyl complex. By oxidative addition of hydrogen and elimination of the aldehyde the initial <b>metal</b> <b>carbonyl</b> hydride complex is regenerated.|$|R
