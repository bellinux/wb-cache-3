40|$|Tunable {{add-drop}} multiplexer {{systems that}} are feasible and exhibit good performance characteristics are highly desirable for building all-optical transmission systems. A novel sparse tunable optical add/drop <b>multiplexer</b> <b>subsystem</b> consisting of eight tunable single-ring resonator based optical filters, and two eight-channel phase array devices, is proposed to allow sparse optical channels add and/or drop. The design {{takes advantage of the}} main limitation of single ring resonator-based optical filters, namely the rather limited free spectral range and in effect the limited number of communication channels that can be processed. The tunable filters provide add and drop functions of the selected channels whereas the phase array devices provide demultiplexing and multiplexing functions for the inbound and the outbound channels respectively. The coupled mode theory, its transfer matrix formalism, and the theory of spectral analysis of signals are used to carry out preliminary performance analysis of the single-ring resonator based tunable add-drop filter, to optimize, and finally to characterize its performance. This approach allows an accurate evaluation of filter characteristics, namely the transfer functions between any ports of the device. A wavelength-domain simulation method, coupled with a time/frequency-domain simulation method, is used to analyse the performance of the tunable OADM in linear, ring, and mesh all-optical wavelength-division multiplexing networks/transmission systems. Our performance evaluation demonstrates that the tunable OADM could be successfully employed in linear, ring, and mesh all-optical dense-division multiplexing networks/transmission systems with bit rates up to 10 Gbit/s...|$|E
40|$|The EU FP 7 project MODE-GAP targets the 100 -fold {{enhancement}} {{of the overall}} capacity of broadband core networks. The project aims to achieve this by focusing {{on a number of}} strategic areas: the development of ultra-low loss multimode (MM) solid-core and photonic band gap transmission fibres, novel rare earth optical amplifiers for few-mode propagation and expanding into new transmission window through the development of sources and detectors 2 um window. The MIMO arrangements for coupling into and out of multi-mode fibres are critical. In addition, the development of MIMO digital signal processing algorithms for coherent detection of the spatial MM channels is key to unraveling the mixed mode channels.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} {{detailed}} design layout {{for the next}} generation optical metropolitan network to be equipped with Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop <b>Multiplexer</b> (ROADM) <b>subsystems.</b> It demonstrates the key features of ROADM subsystems including the development of ring-to-ring interconnection in optical domain. Simulation models are developed for the ROADM subsystems that can easily be configured according to the devices' available specification sheet. The developed simulation models have been verified with experimental measurements obtained from a reconfigurable all-optical metro network testbed. Such simulation modules will be valuable in planning and designing the next generation metro optical networks. Combining the outcome of the research results presented in the thesis, a hybrid reconfigurable add/drop module is proposed. The proposed hybrid architecture can achieve lower loss among the existing 3 rd generation ROADM modules. The functionality of ROADMs can also be improved by an Intelligent ROADM subsystem proposed {{for the next generation}} dynamically provisioned wavelength network...|$|R
