25|$|It {{takes the}} average cow {{three to five}} minutes to give her milk. Some cows are faster or slower. Slow-milking cows may take up to fifteen minutes to let down all their milk. Though milking speed {{is not related to}} the quality of milk {{produced}} by the cow, it does impact the management of the milking process. Because most milkers <b>milk</b> <b>cattle</b> in groups, the milker can only process a group of cows at the speed of the slowest-milking cow. For this reason, many farmers will group slow-milking cows so as not to stress the faster milking cows.|$|E

Wonder how long we can keep it up, Hank? We're safe as long as the good little boys like George Babbitt and all the nice respectable labor-leaders think you and me are rugged patriots. There's swell pickings for an honest politician here, Hank: a whole city working to provide cigars and fried chicken and dry martinis for us, and rallying to our banner with indignation, oh, fierce indignation, whenever some squealer like this fellow Seneca Doane comes along!

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was {{isolation}} and identification of bacteria associated with mastitis of cattle, sheep and goats. A total of 90 milk samples were collected from animals with mastitis in different areas in Khartoum state. The samples were collected during the period between October 2002 to April 2003. Milk samples were collected from cattle, sheep and goats before treatment and after treatment. The antibiotics used for treatment were Neomicin, Gentamicin, Cloxacillin, Amoxacillin and Rubrocilline. The Gram-positive bacteria isolated from mastitic <b>milk</b> of <b>cattle,</b> sheep and goat collected before treatment were Staphylococci spp (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus wareneri, Staphylococcus simians, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus simulans and Staphylococcus carnosus), Streptococci spp (Streptococcus porcinus, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae), Bacillus spp (Bacillus alvei, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus cereus) and Corynebacterium spp (Corynebacteria bovis, Corynebacteria haemolyticum and Arcanobacterium pyogenes). The Gram-negative bacteria isolated from mastitic <b>milk</b> of <b>cattle,</b> sheep and goats collected before treatment were Klebsilla pneumoniae and Pseudomonus areuginosa. The Gram-positive bacteria isolated from mastitic <b>milk</b> of <b>cattle,</b> sheep and goats collected 3 days after treatment were Streptococcus zooepidemicus and Bacillus pantothenticus. The Gram-negative bacteria isolated from mastitic <b>milk</b> of <b>cattle,</b> sheep and goats collected 3 days after treatment were E. coli, Bacteroides vulgatus, Logionella pneumophila, Actinobacillus lignieresii, Pasteurella multocida, Morgenella morganii and Enterobacter aerogenes. The Gram-positive bacteria isolated from mastitic <b>milk</b> of <b>cattle,</b> sheep and goats collected 7 - 10 days after treatment were Staphylococci spp (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus caseolyticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis Staphylococcus cheromogens and Staphylococcus hyicus), Streptococci spp (Streptococcus pyogenes) and Bacillus spp (Bacillus pentothenticus). The Gram-negative bacteria isolated from mastitic <b>milk</b> of <b>cattle,</b> sheep and goats collected 7 - 10 days after treatment were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Acinetobacter lwoffii and Proteus penneri.
