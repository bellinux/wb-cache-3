5|$|Goliath is a clone {{after the}} Bolliger & Mabillard's Batman model. The {{original}} was introduced 1992 {{and became a}} huge success where multiple parks introduced the same model to their lineup. The Batman <b>model</b> <b>can</b> be found all over the world. Goliath is different then the rest as the roller coaster mirrored from the other clones. Goliath {{is not the only}} Batman model in San Antonio as SeaWorld had introduced one first in 1997.|$|E

50|$|Groundwater <b>models</b> <b>can</b> be one-dimensional, two-dimensional, {{three-dimensional}} and semi-three-dimensional.

50|$|Mathematical <b>models</b> <b>can</b> {{take many}} forms, {{including}} {{but not limited}} to dynamical systems, statistical models, differential equations, or game theoretic models.

5|$|One {{important}} {{example of}} a matrix model is the BFSS matrix model proposed by Tom Banks, Willy Fischler, Stephen Shenker, and Leonard Susskind in 1997. This theory describes {{the behavior of a}} set of nine large matrices. In their original paper, these authors showed, among other things, that the low energy limit of this matrix model is described by eleven-dimensional supergravity. These calculations led them to propose that the BFSS matrix model is exactly equivalent to M-theory. The BFSS matrix <b>model</b> <b>can</b> therefore be used as a prototype for a correct formulation of M-theory and a tool for investigating the properties of M-theory in a relatively simple setting.|$|E
5|$|Two hardpoints {{are present}} on the {{underside}} of the airframe on which the HM1 <b>model</b> <b>can</b> carry four Sting Ray torpedoes or Mk 11 Mod 3 depth charges. Some customers have chosen to deploy the Marte anti-ship missile on the AW101; as of 2011, the Royal Navy is considering equipping their Merlin fleet with an anti-surface missile. The Mk1, Mk3 and Mk3A variants can mount general purpose machine guns in up to five locations in the main cabin, aimed out of both door and window apertures. AgustaWestland has examined the integration of rockets and additional ground-attack weapons.|$|E
25|$|The {{validity}} of the <b>model</b> <b>can</b> be tested by comparing simulation results with time series observations. A partial validation of a Boolean network <b>model</b> <b>can</b> also come from testing the predicted existence of a yet unknown regulatory connection between two particular transcription factors that each are nodes of the model.|$|E
50|$|PBPK <b>models</b> <b>can</b> rely on {{chemical}} property prediction models (QSAR models or predictive chemistry models) on one hand. For example, QSAR <b>models</b> <b>can</b> {{be used to}} estimate partition coefficients. They also extend into, but are not destined to supplant, systems biology models of metabolic pathways. They are also parallel to physiome models, but do not aim at modelling physiological functions beyond fluid circulation in detail. In fact the above four types of <b>models</b> <b>can</b> reinforce each other when integrated.|$|R
40|$|This article reports Monte Carlo {{results on}} the {{simulated}} maximum likelihood estimation of discrete dynamic panel models introduced by James Heckman (1981 a). The simulated maximum likelihood method is numerically stable even for long panels. Regression models and Polya and Renewal <b>models</b> <b>can</b> be better estimated than Markov models. With a moderate number of simulation draws, most of these complex <b>models</b> <b>can</b> be adequately estimated for panels with length up to 30. Polya and Renewal <b>models</b> <b>can</b> be accurately estimated for panels up to 50 periods. Estimates of Markov <b>models</b> <b>can</b> be sensitive to misspecified initial states but Polya, Renewal, and Habit Persistence models may not. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science S. A...|$|R

25|$|The {{difference}} between two models is that hierarchical <b>model</b> <b>can</b> explicitly make causal inference to predict certain stimulus while non-hierarchical <b>model</b> <b>can</b> only predict joint probability of stimuli. However, hierarchical model {{is actually a}} special case of non-hierarchical model by setting joint prior as a weighted average of the prior to common and independent causes, each weighted by their prior probability. Based on the correspondence of these two models, we can also say that hierarchical is a mixture modal of non-hierarchical model.|$|E
50|$|Contrary to phenomenological <b>modelling,</b> {{nonlinear}} <b>modelling</b> <b>can</b> {{be utilized}} in processes and systems where {{the theory is}} deficient or {{there is a lack}} of fundamental understanding on the root causes of most crucial factors on system. Phenomenological modelling describes a system in terms of laws of nature. Nonlinear <b>modelling</b> <b>can</b> be utilized in situations where the phenomena are not well understood or expressed in mathematical terms. Thus nonlinear <b>modelling</b> <b>can</b> be an efficient way to model new and complex situations where relationships of different variables are not known.|$|R
