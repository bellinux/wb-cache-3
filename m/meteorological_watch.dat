5000|$|Short-term {{forecasts}} {{are made}} at the <b>meteorological</b> <b>watch</b> (metwatch) desk. It issues mesoscale precipitation discussions (MPDs) as flash flood guidance for NWS forecast offices (NWSFOs), NWS River Forecast Centers (RFCs), the media, emergency managers, and other users. MPDs contain technical discussions concerning heavy rainfall events and expected impacts on flash flooding. They are ideally issued 1-6 hours preceding an event, include graphical descriptions of the details and the area covered. Their size typically is about {{half the size of}} Kansas. There are three headlines ordered by severity: [...] "flash flooding likely", [...] "flash flooding possible", or [...] "flash flooding unlikely". Mesoscale discussions (MDs) once were issued by the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) for both convective (MCDs) and precipitation (MPDs) events but WPC now covers this heavy rainfall function.|$|E

The calibration of the instruments is based on annual recalibrations of primary standard lamps in the VTT MIKES Metrology National Standards Laboratory in Finland and an exhaustive measurement program with measurements of standard and working lamps in the on-site optical laboratories. Over the years, the maintenance of the calibration has produced data sets of approximately 2000 lamp scans for both instruments. An extensive re-examination of the lamp measurements and the response of the spectrophotometers was carried out. The primary standard lamps were found to age on an average rate of 0. 3 % per burn. The responsivity at wavelength 311 nm was found to exhibit both long-term and short-term changes. The overall long-term change was declining. In addition, abrupt changes of as large as 25 % were detected. The short-term changes were found to fluctuate on time frames shorter than the interval between the measurements of the primary standard lamps. This underlines the importance of the use of more frequently measured working standard lamps...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} of using global reanalysis datasets as input for hydrological modelling in the data-scarce Sudano-Sahel region. To achieve this, we used two global atmospheric reanalyses (Climate Forecasting System Reanalysis and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim) datasets and one global <b>meteorological</b> forcing dataset <b>WATCH</b> Forcing Data methodology applied to ERA-Interim (WFDEI). These datasets were used to drive the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in the Logone catchment in the Lake Chad basin. Model performance indicators after calibration showed that, at daily and monthly time steps, only WFDEI produced Nash Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) and Coefficient of Determination (R 2) values above 0. 50. Despite a general underperformance compared to WFDEI, CFSR performed better than the ERA-Interim. Model uncertainty analysis after calibration showed that more than 60 % of all daily and monthly observed streamflow values at all hydrometric stations were bracketed within the 95 percent prediction uncertainty (95 PPU) range for all datasets. Results from this study also show significant differences in simulated actual evapotranspiration estimates from the datasets. Overall results showed that biased corrected WFDEI outperformed the two reanalysis datasets; meanwhile CFSR performed better than the ERA-Interim. We conclude that, {{in the absence of}} gauged hydro-meteorological data, WFDEI and CFSR could be used for hydrological modelling in data-scarce areas such as the Sudano-Sahel region...|$|R
40|$|Currently, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS) {{runs the}} HYSPLIT {{dispersion}} {{model with a}} unit mass release rate to predict the transport and dispersion of volcanic ash. The model predictions provide information for the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAAC) to issue advisories to <b>meteorological</b> <b>watch</b> offices, area control centers, flight information centers, and others. This research aims to provide quantitative forecasts of ash distributions generated by objectively and optimally estimating the volcanic ash source strengths, vertical distribution, and temporal variations using an observation-modeling inversion technique. In this top-down approach, a cost functional is defined to quantify {{the differences between the}} model predictions and the satellite measurements of column-integrated ash concentrations weighted by the model and observation uncertainties. Minimizing this cost functional by adjusting the sources provides the volcanic ash emission estimates. As an example, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite retrievals of the 2008 Kasatochi volcanic ash clouds are used to test the HYSPLIT volcanic ash inverse system. Because the satellite retrievals include the ash cloud top height but not the bottom height, there are different model diagnostic choices for comparing the model results with the observed mass loadings. Three options are presented and tested. Although the emission estimates vary significantly with different options, the subsequent model predictions with the different release estimates all show decent skill when evaluated against the unassimilated satellite observations at later times. Among the three options, integrating over three model layers yields slightly better results than integrating from the surface up to the observed volcanic ash cloud top or using a single model layer. Inverse tests also show that including the ash-free region to constrain the model is not beneficial for the current case. In addition, extra constraints on the source terms can be given by explicitly enforcing no-ash for the atmosphere columns above or below the observed ash cloud top height. However, in this case such extra constraints are not helpful for the inverse modeling. It is also found that simultaneously assimilating observations at different times produces better hindcasts than only assimilating the most recent observations...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} {{changes in}} global mean and extreme streamflow volumes over recent decades, we statistically analyzed runoff and streamflow simulated by the WBM-plus hydrological model using either observational-based <b>meteorological</b> inputs from <b>WATCH</b> Forcing Data (WFD), or bias-corrected inputs from five global climate models (GCMs) {{provided by the}} Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP). Results show that the bias-corrected GCM inputs yield very good agreement with the observation-based inputs in average magnitude of runoff and streamflow. On global average, the observation-based simulated mean runoff and streamflow both decreased about 1. 3 % from 1971 to 2001. However, GCM-based simulations yield increasing trends over that period, with an inter-model global average of 1 % for mean runoff and 0. 9 % for mean streamflow. In the GCM-based simulations, relative changes in extreme runoff and extreme streamflow (annual maximum daily values and annual-maximum seven-day streamflow) are slightly greater than those of mean runoff and streamflow, in terms of global and continental averages. Observation-based simulations show increasing trend in mean runoff and streamflow for about one-half of the land areas and decreasing trend for the other half. However, mean and extreme runoff and streamflow based on the GCMs show increasing trend for approximately two-thirds of the global land area and decreasing trend for the other one-third. Further work is needed to understand why GCM simulations appear to indicate trends in streamflow that are more positive than those suggested by climate observations, even where, as in ISI-MIP, bias correction has been applied so that their streamflow climatology is realistic...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new methodology {{for assessing the}} ability of gridded hydrological models to reproduce large-scale hydrological high and low flow events (as a proxy for hydrological extremes) as described by catalogues of historical droughts [using the regional deficiency index (RDI) ] and high flows [regional flood index (RFI) ] previously derived from river flow measurements across Europe. Using the same methods, total runoff simulated by three global hydrological models from the Water Model Intercomparison Project (WaterMIP) [Joint U. K. Land Environment Simulator (JULES), Water Global Assessment and Prognosis (WaterGAP), and Max Planck Institute Hydrological Model (MPI-HM) ] run with the same <b>meteorological</b> input (<b>watch</b> forcing data) at the same spatial 0. 5 ° grid was used to calculate simulated RDI and RFI for the period 1963 – 2001 in the same European regions, directly comparable with the observed catalogues. Observed and simulated RDI and RFI time series were compared using three performance measures: the relative mean error, the ratio between the standard deviation of simulated over observed series, and the Spearman correlation coefficient. Results show that all models can broadly reproduce the spatiotemporal evolution of hydrological extremes in Europe to varying degrees. JULES tends to produce prolonged, highly spatially coherent events for both high and low flows, with events developing more slowly and reaching and sustaining greater spatial coherence than observed—this {{could be due to}} runoff being dominated by slow-responding subsurface flow. In contrast, MPI-HM shows very high variability in the simulated RDI and RFI time series and a more rapid onset of extreme events than observed, in particular for regions with significant water storage capacity—this could be due to possible underrepresentation of infiltration and groundwater storage, with soil saturation reached too quickly. WaterGAP shares some of the issues of variability with MPI-HM—also attributed to insufficient soil storage capacity and surplus effective precipitation being generated as surface runoff—and some strong spatial coherence of simulated events with JULES, but neither of these are dominant. Of the three global models considered here, WaterGAP is arguably best suited to reproduce most regional characteristics of large-scale high and low flow events in Europe. Some systematic weaknesses emerge in all models, in particular for high flows, which could be a product of poor spatial resolution of the input climate data (e. g., where extreme precipitation is driven by local convective storms) or topography. Overall, this study has demonstrated that RDI and RFI are powerful tools {{that can be used to}} assess how well large-scale hydrological models reproduce large-scale hydrological extremes—an exercise rarely undertaken in model intercomparisons...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) mole {{fractions}} were continuously measured from January 2009 to December 2011 at 4 atmospheric observatories in China ((Lin'an, LAN), (Longfengshan, LFS), (Shangdianzi, SDZ), and (Waliguan, WLG)) using Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy instruments. All sites are regional (LAN, LFS, SDZ) or global (WLG) measurement {{stations of the}} World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization/Global Atmosphere <b>Watch</b> program (WMO/GAW). LAN is located near the megacity of Shanghai, in China's most economically developed region. LFS is in a forest and rice production area, close {{to the city of}} Harbin in the northern east of China. SDZ is located 150 km north east of Beijing. WLG, hosting the longest record of measured CO 2 mole fractions in China, is a high altitude site in northwest China recording background CO 2 values. The CO 2 growth rates are 2. 2 ± 0. 2 ppm yr − 1 for LAN, 2. 3 ± 0. 2 ppm yr − 1 for LFS, 2. 0 ± 0. 2 ppm yr − 1 for SDZ, and 1. 2 ± 0. 1 ppm yr − 1 (1 σ) for WLG, during the period of 2009 to 2011. The growth rate at WLG may be underestimated due to the data gaps during the observation period. The highest annual mean CO 2 mole fraction of 404. 1 ± 4. 1 ppm was observed at LAN in 2011. A comprehensive analysis of CO 2 variations, their diurnal and seasonal cycles as well as the analysis of the influence of different wind regimes on the CO 2 mole fractions allows a thorough characterization of the sampling sites and of the key processes driving the CO 2 mole fractions. These data form a basis to improve our understanding of atmospheric CO 2 variations in China and the underlying fluxes, using atmospheric inversion models...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of atmospheric CO 2 observation data which are minimally influenced by very local emissions/removals {{is essential for}} trend analysis, for the estimation of regional sources and sinks, and for the modeling of long-range transport of CO 2. In this study, four approaches are used to filter the atmospheric CO 2 observation records from 2009 to 2011 at one World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization/Global Atmosphere <b>Watch</b> (WMO/GAW) regional station (Lin'an, LAN) in China. The methods {{are based on the}} concentration of atmospheric black carbon (BC), on a statistical approach (robust extraction of baseline signal, REBS), on CH 4 as an auxiliary tracer (AUX), and on meteorological parameters (MET). All approaches do suitably well to capture the seasonal CO 2 cycle at LAN. Differences are observed in the average regional mole fractions with annual values in the REBS method at least 1. 7 ± 0. 2 ppm higher than the other methods. The BC method may underestimate the regional CO 2 mole fractions during the winter–spring period and should be treated with caution. The REBS method is a purely statistical method and it may also introduce errors on the regional CO 2 mole fraction evaluations, as the filtered trend may be influenced by the "noisy" raw data series. Although there are correlations between CH 4 and CO 2 mole fractions at LAN, the different source/sink regimes may introduce bias on the regional CO 2 estimation in the AUX method, typically in summer. Overall, the MET method seems to be the most favorable because it mainly focuses on the influence of potential local sources and sinks, and considers diurnal variations and meteorological conditions. Using the MET method, the annual growth rate of regional CO 2 at LAN is determined to be 3. 1 ± 0. 01 ppm yr − 1 (standard error) from 2009 to 2011...|$|R
40|$|Mole {{fractions}} of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) and carbon monoxide (CO) have been continuously measured since September 2010 at the Shangri-La station (28. 02 ° N, 99. 73 ° E, 3580 masl) in China using a cavity ring-down spectrometer. The station {{is located in}} the remote southwest of China, and it is the only station in that region with background conditions for greenhouse gas observations. The vegetation canopy around the station is dominated by coniferous forests and mountain meadows and there is no large city (population > 1 million) within a 360 km radius. Characteristics of the mole fractions, growth rates, influence of long-distance transport as well as the Weighted Potential CO Sources Contribution Function (WPSCF) were studied considering data from September 2010 to May 2014. The diurnal CO 2 variation in summer indicates a strong influence of regional terrestrial ecosystem with the maximum CO 2 value at 7 : 00 (local time) and the minimum in late afternoon. The highest peak-to-bottom amplitude in the diurnal cycles is in summer, with a value of 18. 2 ± 2. 0 ppm. The annual growth rate of regional CO 2 is estimated to be 2. 5 ± 1. 0 ppm yr− 1 (1 -σ), which is close to that of the Mt. Waliguan World <b>Meteorological</b> Organization/Global Atmosphere <b>Watch</b> (WMO/GAW) global station (2. 2 ± 0. 8 ppm yr− 1), that is also located at the Tibetan plateau but 900 km north. The CO mole fractions observed at Shangri-La are representative for both in large spatial scale (probably continental/subcontinental) and regional scale. The annual CO growth rate is estimated to be - 2. 6 ± 0. 2 ppb yr− 1 (1 -σ). But the CO rate of decrease in continental/subcontinental scale is apparently larger than the regional scale. From the back trajectory study, it could be seen that the atmospheric CO mole fractions at Shangri-La are subjected to transport from the Northern Africa and Southwestern Asia sectors except for summer and part of autumn. The WPSCF analysis indicates that the western and southwestern areas of the Shangri-La station (India, Myanmar and Bangladesh) {{may be the most important}} CO sources...|$|R
40|$|The large {{impacts of}} drought on society, economy and {{environment}} urge for a thorough investigation. A good knowledge of past drought events {{is important for}} both understanding of the processes causing drought, {{as well as to}} provide reliability assessments for drought projections for the future. Preferably, the investigation of historic drought events should rely on observations. Unfortunately, for a global scale these detailed observations are often not available. Therefore, the outcome of global hydrological models (GHMs) and off-line land surface models (LSMs) is used to assess droughts. In this study we have investigated to what extent simulated gridded time series from these large-scale models capture historic hydrological drought events. Results of ten different models, both GHMs and LSMs, made available by the WATCH project, were compared. All models are run on a global 0. 5 degree grid for the period 1963 - 2000 with the same <b>meteorological</b> forcing data (<b>WATCH</b> forcing data). To identify hydrological drought events, the monthly aggregated total runoff values were used. Different methods were developed to identify spatio-temporal drought characteristics. General drought characteristics for each grid cell, as for example the average drought duration, were compared. These characteristics show that when comparing absolute values the models give substantially different results, whereas relative values lead to {{more or less the same}} drought pattern. Next to the general drought characteristics, some documented major historical drought events (one for each continent) were selected and described in more detail. For each drought event, the simulated drought clusters (spatial events) and their characteristics are given for one month during the event. It can be concluded that most major drought events are captured by all models. However, the spatial extent of the drought events differ substantially between the models. In general the models show a fast reaction to rainfall and therefore also capture drought events caused by large rainfall anomalies. More research is still needed, since here we only looked at a few selected number of documented drought events spread over the globe. To assess more in detail if these large-scale models are able to capture drought, additional quantitative analyses are needed together with a more elaborated comparison against observed drought events...|$|R
