25|$|Jaw crushers {{are heavy}} duty {{machines}} and hence {{need to be}} robustly constructed. The outer frame is generally made of cast iron or steel. The jaws themselves are usually constructed from cast steel. They are fitted with replaceable liners which are made of <b>manganese</b> <b>steel,</b> or Ni-hard (a Ni-Cr alloyed cast iron).

40|$|The present {{paper is}} focused on the effect of {{manganese}} on microstructure development of admixed Fe-Mn-C sintered steels along with diffusion characteristics of manganese in the iron matrix. Admixed systems were prepared on the base of sponge iron powder, with addition of 0. 3 % C and 3 % Mn added as ferromanganese. Sintering at 1, 023, 1, 173, 1, 323, 1, 423 and 1, 473 K for 180 s was carried out in laboratory tube furnace in an atmosphere of pure gases mixture 25 % N- 2 + 75 % H- 2 with the dew point of 243 K. The results show that admixed sintered <b>manganese</b> <b>steels</b> exhibit heterogeneity of microstructure due to the local chemical heterogeneities of these materials, in particular for those areas with a high manganese concentration. On the basis of calculation of manganese apparent diffusion coefficient and penetration depth, results reveal that diffusion-induced grain boundary migration (DIGM) is the dominant alloying mechanism in sintered <b>manganese</b> <b>steels...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} boron and/or carbon {{additions}} on the microstructure and properties of sintered <b>manganese</b> <b>steels</b> was investigated.

The main objective of this work was to find correlation between sintering temperature and chemical composition of steel and theirs properties. It was shown that both alloying elements and sintering temperature influence the microstructure and properties of sintered <b>manganese</b> <b>steels.</b> When boron or graphite was added, density and also hardness of the Fe-Mn-Cr-Mo steels were increased. Significant change in hardness were related {{to changes in the}} microstructure. Boron has a beneficial effect on the densification process, due to faster and more efficient sintering kinetics.

Elihu Thomson, born in Manchester who subsequently moved to America, formed Thomson-CSF which became Thales Group in 2000.

Henry Brunner from Liverpool would join with Ludwig Mond in the 1860s to form a chemical company which became ICI in 1926. Mossbay Steelworks in Workington, when opened in 1877, were the world's first large-scale steelworks; its austenitic <b>manganese</b> <b>steel</b> (mangalloy) was produced from 1877 until 1974, with Britain's railways converting from iron to steel by the 1880s. Track was made there for the UK's railways (exclusively from the 1970s onwards, with the steel made in Teesside) until August 2006; much of the rails made were exported (from 1882), with its main competitor being Voestalpine of Austria, and a plant (bought by British Steel in 1999) in Hayange, France, who make all of SNCF's railway tracks, and the Katowice Steelworks in Poland.

The Germans also used molybdenum-doped steel for heavy artillery, like in the super-heavy howitzer Big Bertha, because traditional steel melts at the temperatures produced by the propellant of the one ton shell. After the war, demand plummeted until metallurgical advances allowed extensive development of peacetime applications. In World War II, molybdenum again saw strategic importance as a substitute for tungsten in steel alloys.|$|E
