40|$|Increasingly, file {{systems for}} multiprocessors are {{designed}} with parallel access to multiple disks, to keep I/O from becoming a serious bottleneck for parallel applications. Although file system software can transparently provide high-performance access to parallel disks, a new file system interface is needed to facilitate parallel access to a file from a parallel application. We describe the difficulties faced when using the conventional (Unix-like) interface in parallel applications, and then outline ways to extend the conventional interface to provide convenient access to the file for parallel programs, while retaining the traditional interface for programs that have no need for explicitly parallel file access.

40|$|Background: Mental Health Conditions {{including}} Major Depressive Disorders cause many {{emergency department}} visits and hospital admissions with few acute treatment options. The use of N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist {{drugs such as}} Ketamine show promise in treatment of these patients. Method: Exhaustive search of medical literature using MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsychInfo, and EBM <b>multifiles</b> was conducted, using search terms Ketamine, Major Depressive Disorder, N-methyl-D-aspartate Antagonist, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonist. Articles that were not randomized control trials or were duplicates were excluded. Results: Two studies fit inclusion, exclusion criteria. The studies found were of low quality using the GRADE approach. Patients that received Ketamine when compared to placebo {{were found to have}} a decrease in depressive symptoms. Conclusion: The current research shows a connection between N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists like Ketamine and decrease depressive symptoms.

40|$|Background: Polycystic ovarian {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is {{a common}} endocrine disorder that affects the fertility of reproductive-aged women due {{to high levels of}} testosterone. Metformin is currently used to treat patients with PCOS in order to improve the biochemical markers of the disease. New studies show that statin medications like simvastatin may prove efficacious with reduction of testosterone levels, and therefore, possibly increase fertility. Methods: An extensive search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and EBM <b>Multifiles</b> was conducted. Articles that were not written in the English language and duplicate articles were excluded. Results: Three studies were identified through the search of literature. The studies showed that simvastatin and metformin therapy do reduce testosterone levels in patients with PCOS. The studies used for this review were of low to very low quality. Conclusion: Based on current research, utilizing simvastatin and metformin as dual therapies for patients with PCOS should not be recommended. Even though {{there seems to be some}} significance to the therapy in decreasing testosterone levels and other biochemical markers of the disease, more high-quality research is necessary to determine the effects of simvastatin plus metformin therapy in polycystic ovarian syndrome patients.

40|$|Motivation: One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} features of genomes (both coding and non-coding regions) is the presence of relatively short tandemly repeated DNA sequences known as tandem repeats (TRs). We developed a new PC-based standalone software analysis program, combining sequence motif searches with keywords such as organs, tissues, cell lines or development stages for finding exact, inexact and compound, TRs. Tandem Repeats Analyzer 1. 5 (TRA) has several advanced repeat search parameters/options over other repeat finder programs as it does not only accept GenBank, FASTA and expressed sequence tag (EST) sequence files but also does analysis of <b>multifiles</b> with multisequences. Advanced user-defined parameters/options let the researchers use different motif lengths search criteria for varying motif lengths simultaneously. The outputs show statistical results to be evaluated by the user. The discovery of TRs in ESTs could be useful for both gene mapping and association studies and discovering TRs located in coding regions of important genes that are expressed under various conditions of environment, stress, organ, tissue and development stage. Results: In this paper, we demonstrated applications of TRA using 175 899 ESTs sequences for three Arabidopsis spp. downloaded from GenBank. The EST-SSRs/ESTs ratios were found 43. 1 %, 15. 3 % and 2. 34 % in A. lyrata, A. thaliana and A. halleri, respectively. Analysis revealed that organs, tissues and development stages possessed different amounts of repeats and repeat compositions. This indicated that the distribution of TRs among the tissues or organs may not be random differing from the untranscribed repeats found in genomes.

40|$|Abstract — This paper revisits a basic {{question}} in data management, namely whether locality of reference {{is an important}} factor for the performance of caches in grid workloads. We answer this question by experimental evaluations using more than two years of real workloads from a science collaboration. Our results show that: (1) locality of reference is significant for these particular workloads and thus it is beneficial to consider it in cache replacement algorithms; and (2) using locality of reference and data request reordering gives better performance along multiple performance metrics than either one of these techniques. We support the latter conclusion by proposing and evaluating a cache management algorithm that combines locality of reference with request reordering while accounting for <b>multifile</b> requests. Experimental evaluation on real traces shows that this technique leads to significantly lower costs in wide-area data transfers than previous solutions for multi-file caching, while achieving increased hit rate.

40|$|Background: The {{problem of}} obesity {{in the adult}} {{population}} requires the exploration and development of new, safe effective therapies to combat increasing girth. Implantable gastric electrical stimulation (GES) offers a novel, minimally invasive surgical approach to promote weight loss. This report utilizes the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool to review and evaluate current literature exploring GES as a safe and effective therapy for reducing obesity in adults. Method: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was conducted in the PubMed, Medline, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews <b>Multifile,</b> Web of Science, and CINHAL databases. Results: Three studies were reviewed for the primary endpoint of percentage of excess weight loss (EWL) and secondary endpoint of device safety. GRADE results revealed moderate levels of evidence for both of these endpoints. A small subset of adult patients experienced weight loss ranging between 5 - 17 % EWL while other patients experienced weight gain. Conclusion: Use of a gastric electrical stimulation device fails to produce any significant weight loss in obese individuals when compared to traditional lifestyle changes of diet and exercise.

40|$|Background: Diabetes is a {{significant}} health problem currently and is linked {{to a variety of}} mental health issues. In order to adequately control this disease, patients must have good mental health status and methods of dealing with stress. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a technique people can use in all facets of their life for decreasing their level of mental stress. This review looks at the effects of using MBSR on glycemic control in diabetic patients. Methods: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was performed using Medline-OVID, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and EBMR <b>Multifile.</b> Keywords used included: diabetes, diabetes mellitus type I, diabetes mellitus type II, diabetes mellitus, mindfulness, and meditation. Results: 21 articles were reviewed for relevancy. Three studies were found, including 2 RCTs and one observational study. One of the three studies found a drop in HbA 1 C and all showed improvements in mental health of the participants. The overall quality of the studies was low and further study would need to be done to follow up with patients {{for a longer period of}} time.

40|$|Background: Motion {{sickness}} is {{a common}} problem experienced by much the population. Clinical treatments at this time are primarily pharmacological. Currently {{it is known that}} multiple exposures to motion sickness triggers can, over time, result in habituation and the patient can become free of symptoms. This repeated recurrence of sickness is not desirable or practical to daily living. Limited evidence is available for visual-vestibular habituation training that does not provoke the undesirable symptoms and can last for upwards of a year. Method: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was conducted using Medline-OVID, CINAHL, VISIONCITE, EBMR <b>Multifile</b> and Web of Science using the keywords: motion sickness, visual vestibular and habituation. All articles published prior to 2000, non-English language and non-human trials were excluded by the search. Relevant articles were assessed for quality using GRADE. Results: Three studies met inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. A pilot study consisting of 29 subjects demonstrated visual-vestibular habituation and reduction of motion sickness symptom scores in susceptible individuals from 13. 0 ± 4. 4 to 1. 5 ± 3. 1 eighteen weeks after habituation.

40|$|Current {{knowledge}} of slow virus diseases provides {{a foundation for}} examining the possible viral etiology {{of a number of}} chronic degenerative diseases, including <b>multifile</b> sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, and diabetes mellitus. General Comments The designation slow virus disease refers not to the causal agent but {{to the fact that the}} diseases induced have a slow, relentless-ly progressive course and a fatal termina-tion. These diseases can be divided into two categories according to whether the causal agent is a typical, conventional virus (propagable in vitro; cytopathogenic; anti-genie; associated with inflammatory le-sions, for example of the central nervous system, etc.) or a transmissible agent whose properties and behavior suggest an uncon-ventional or atypical virus. In the latter category are four of the classic slow virus diseases, namely kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease of man (Table 1) and scrapie and mink encephalopathy of animals (Table 2). The transmissible agents involved are regarded as atypical viruses because of their nature, properties, and characteristics; and, because of the similar pathologic picture they induce, they are regarded as prototypic viruses of this group, collectively referred to as the subacute spongifoorm encephalopathies. The label encephalopathy rather than encephalitis is used because the widespread destructive cerebral changes present a pic...|$|E
40|$|Background: Migraine {{headache}} is {{a common}} condition among children and the prevalence increases into adolescence. Multiple studies have shown riboflavin {{to be an effective}} and safe agent for migraine prophylaxis in adults but few studies have looked at using riboflavin in children and adolescents. The purpose of this paper was to perform a systematic review of the literature on the use of riboflavin for migraine prophylaxis in the pediatric population including children and adolescents. The quality of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool developed by the GRADE Working Group. Method: An extensive literature search was performed using MEDLINE, CINAHL, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews <b>Multifile,</b> Web of Science, and PubMed. The keyword search terms “migraine” and “riboflavin” were searched individually and in combination. Search results were limited to human studies, articles published in English, and those published from 2000 - 2011. Studies of adult patients, duplicates, descriptive reviews, and letters to the editor were excluded. This resulted in three studies, which were analyzed in this review. Results: Two randomized controlled trials (RCT) and one observational study were included. Both RCTs found no significant difference between treatment and placebo groups for migraine frequency, severity, and duration. The observational study showed a significant decrease in migraine frequency and severity. Conclusion: There is currently low quality evidence supporting the use of riboflavin as migraine prophylaxis in children and adolescents and only a weak recommendation can be made for its use...|$|E
40|$|Background: Osteoarthritis is {{the most}} common joint {{disorder}} in the world today and affects over 27 million individuals in the US. The standard treatment of osteoarthritis is the use of NSAIDs, which come with a list of potentially serious side effects, the most common being GI perforation and bleeding. Bromelain, a proteolytic enzyme that is found in the stem of the pineapple plant may be an effective alternative to typical NSAID therapy with a lower risk profile. Bromelain is currently sold as a combination with other enzymes such as rutin and trypsin. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of oral enzyme combinations to the potent NSAID diclofenac in the management of osteoarthritis. Method: An extensive literature search was done using CINHAL, Medline, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews <b>Multifile,</b> and Web of Science. The search included the terms Bromelain, Arthritis and Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory agents. Results: Five randomized control trials met the inclusion criteria. Each study was very similar with respect to study design and results. Primary outcomes were pain and function measured most often with the Lequesne Index, the VAS or a variation of the two. Each of the 5 studies showed that the oral enzyme combination was as effective as diclofenac in the treatment of osteoarthritis with regards to the primary outcome. Conclusion: This review showed that Oral enzyme therapy is as effective as diclofenac in the treatment of osteoarthritis and can be recommended to patients because of its efficacy and low risk-to-benefit ratio...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pain {{caused by}} {{diabetic}} neuropathy {{is a common}} complication in diabetic patients. Microcurrent therapy is currently being used as an alternative treatment option for painful diabetic neuropathy, yet {{little research has been}} done to date on the efficacy of this treatment option in randomized controlled trials as compared to placebo. This systematic review was performed because there is no general consensus regarding the efficacy of this appealing treatment option for painful diabetic neuropathy Method: An exhaustive literature search using Medline, Cinahl, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews <b>Multifile,</b> and Google Scholar was performed. The following search terms with common synonyms were used: microcurrent and diabetic neuropathy. Only randomized controlled trials were used. Results: Three articles were found that addressed the question of interest and met all eligibility criteria. Two of the three studies showed that microcurrent therapy and placebo significantly reduced pain but one was not more efficacious than the other. The other study found microcurrent therapy was more efficacious than placebo. All studies received a GRADE quality of evidence rating of low. Conclusion: At this time there is not enough high quality evidence to say with any certainty that microcurrent therapy is more efficacious than placebo in reducing pain caused by diabetic neuropathy. The three RCTs that have been performed to date, have been small and have conflicting results. The results do indicate a large placebo effect which should not be discounted when considering the utility of microcurrent therapy...|$|E
40|$|Background: Gambling is a {{legal form}} of {{entertainment}} in 48 states and is enjoyed by many. In Approximately 1 % of the population, casual gaming can turn into pathological gambling (PG) resulting in devastating consequences. There are currently no guidelines or regulations for clinical providers regarding the most effective treatments of PG. Previous research has shown opioid antagonist {{to be effective in}} treating similar addictions such as alcoholism and heroin. How effective are opioid antagonist in the treatment of pathological gambling? Methods: An exhaustive search of Medline-OVID, CINAHL, PSYCHINFO, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews <b>Multifile,</b> and Web of science using keywords: gambling, drug therapy, and narcotic antagonist. Limitations included studies in the English language and on humans. Articles pertaining to the area of interest were evaluated using GRADE. Results: Three studies met inclusion criteria which are discussed in this systematic review. A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 112 participants showed statistically significant reduction in gambling behaviors and urges with 18 weeks of treatment with naltrexone. Another randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 233 participants failed to show significant decrease in gambling behaviors and urges with 18 weeks of treatment with nalmefene compared. Finally, a case study showed complete cessation of gambling behavior and urges with intramuscular monthly injections of naltrexone. Conclusion: Opioid antagonist drug naltrexone may be an effective option for treating pathological gambling whereas a similar drug nalmefene seems to be ineffective. Due to the low quality of evidence, effective injectable naltrexone effective dosing is undetermined...|$|E
40|$|Background: Acute {{hypotension}} {{has been}} treated with the Trendelenburg, or head down tilt (HDT), position for 100 years or more. Prior studies have suggested the HDT position increases central venous blood return and improves cardiac output, but the evidence is not consistent. This systematic review is designed to identify if there are known negative consequences of the HDT position on cardiopulmonary functioning, and determine if those risks outweigh the benefits. Methods: An extensive search on Ovid Medline, CINAHL, and Evidence-Based Medicine Review <b>Multifile</b> was conducted to identify pertinent articles. The inclusionary criteria were, the use of HDT of greater than, or equal 10 ̊, and patients under general anesthesia. Results: Six articles were identified and critically appraised. The data compiled in this systematic review suggest there {{is an increase in}} cardiac preload with no consequent increase in cardiac output or performance. The data suggest there are multiple negative consequences of HDT on pulmonary function including a decrease of functional residual capacity, an increase of atelectasis, and a decrease in oxygenation. Conclusion: There is a lack of clear evidence to support the use of HDT as a treatment for acute hypotension. In the controlled environment of the surgical setting, head-down tilt should be utilized judiciously and for as short a duration as possible. HDT position should be avoided in patients who are obese, have pre-existing obstructive pulmonary disorders, have New York Heart Association class III heart failure, or other significant cardiopulmonary dysfunctio...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{growing body}} of {{research}} is addressing the role iron plays in Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) pathology and treatment. Caring for patients suffering from this disease, one sees the interruption to, and tangible frustration in, the lives of these patients. Consensus for treatment modalities is incomplete. The goal of this systematic review of literature is to provide a complete picture of the role iron plays in the treatment of RLS. Methods: Wide-ranging search of available medical literature. The keywords: Iron, Anemia, Treatment, Restless Legs Syndrome, and Clinical Trial were used in the MEDLINE, CINAHL, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews <b>Multifile</b> and Web of Science databases. Results: The search revealed over 25 articles. The literature used in this systematic literature review was limited to randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, studies published after 2000. In a majority of these studies iron supplementation was shown to produce a statistically significant reduction in patient symptoms. Conclusion: Intravenous (IV) iron supplementation combined with sleep hygiene counseling, is a potential first-line treatment option for patients with Restless Legs Syndrome. Serum ferritin must be monitored before initiating treatment and quarterly once treatment is underway to ensure Hemocromatosis is avoided. Oral dosage of iron requires proper dosage techniques to allow for effective absorption. Attention to this important factor proved lacking in some trials showing no benefit in oral iron supplementation. More information regarding oral and IV iron effectiveness and dosing requirements is necessary for iron to become a universally recognized 1 st line treatment option...|$|E
40|$|Background: Temporomandibular joint {{disorder}} (TMJD) affects nearly 10 {{million people}} in the United States accounting for 17 million lost working days in 2001. Traditional conservative treatment for TMJD has limited benefit, which is why recent trials have studied the effects of botulinum toxin A on TMJD. Using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) the available evidence regarding the efficacy of botulinum toxin A for treating TMJD was evaluated. Method: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was conducted using Medline, CINAHL, Evidence-Based Medicine Review <b>Multifile</b> and PubMed resulting in five randomized controlled trials limited to the English language, randomized controlled trials, and articles published since 2000 involving human subjects. Results: This paper reviewed five studies and evaluated the three outcomes of pain resolution, jaw manipulation, and electromyography conduction using GRADE criteria. Three randomized controlled trials demonstrated reduction in electromyographic activity with the use of botulinum toxin A. Two randomized controlled trials concluded that botulinum toxin A can increase jaw manipulation without pain. Four out of five trails demonstrated improvement in TMJD pain with the use of botulinum toxin A. Conclusion: The final GRADE for this systematic review was determined to be moderate. Although high grade studies need to be conducted, botulinum toxin A appears to be an effective alternative treatment for TMJD.

40|$|Background: Migraine {{headache}} is {{a debilitating}} disorder {{that is difficult}} to manage and is often treated in the emergency department (ED). Many standard abortive therapies used in the ED have mixed efficacy and lead to unsatisfactory results. Propofol is a proposed treatment for acute migraine with the potential to have better efficacy than standard ED abortive medications. This review evaluates propofol’s effectiveness at reducing pain severity and headache recurrence in adult patients with migraine headache when compared to typical abortive therapies. Methods: An exhaustive search of medical literature was completed using Medline-OVID, CINAHL, EBMR <b>Multifile,</b> and Web of Science. Key words used included: propofol, migraine, and headache. Relevant articles were assessed for quality using GRADE. Results: Twenty-two articles were reviewed for relevancy. Two randomized, double blind studies met inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. The first randomized, double blind trial was conducted in an ED and demonstrated a significant decrease in pain severity, nausea and vomiting, and headache relapse within 24 hours when compared to sumatriptan. The second randomized, double blind trial was conducted in an ED and demonstrated a significant decrease in pain severity when compared to dexamethasone. Both studies revealed a significantly faster rate of pain severity reduction when compared to sumatriptan and dexamethasone. Conclusion: Propofol can be an ideal abortive therapy for acute migraine in the ED. It {{has been shown to be}} more effective than sumatriptan and dexamethasone at treating migraine headache. More research is needed to compare propofol’s efficacy to these and other accepted abortive therapies. Keywords: Propofol, migraine, headache, emergency departmen...|$|E

The estimated incidence of spontaneous pneumothorax is 7. 4 to 18 per 100, 000 for males and 1. 2 to 6 per 100, 000 in females. Traditionally pneumothoraces have been treated with chest tube(s) but some have shown clinical success with small pigtail tube drainage. Relevant evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool developed by the GRADE Working Group. Method: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was performed using MEDLINE, Google Scholar, EBM <b>multifile,</b> and CINAHL using “pigtail” “adult” and “pneumothorax” individually and in combination. This search focused on articles published since 1999 pertaining to chest tube thoracostomy versus pigtail tube drainage. Results: Four articles meeting the search criteria were included in the review. These studies evaluated length of hospital stay, time to extubation, total cost, and success rates. Two studies showed a decrease in length of hospital stay as well as decreased time to extubation. One study demonstrated a decrease in total cost and 3 studies reported success rates as acceptable for pigtail tube drainage prior to chest tube thoracostomy. Conclusion: Pigtail tube drainage is a safe and effective alternative to chest tube thoracostomy in adults with spontaneous pneumothoraces. More studies are required as these articles were given a GRADE of low. Keywords: Pneumothorax, adult, chest tube, pigtai...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{numbers of}} {{individuals}} age 50 and over who maintain active lifestyles is growing. Many {{of these individuals}} travel to or live at, higher altitudes, to pursue outdoor activities or travel to higher altitudes for business. The use of anticoagulant therapy has continued to increase {{over the past two}} decades among individuals 50 and over. Warfarin is effective but requires a narrow therapeutic range based on the International Normalized Ratio (INR). Clinicians have concerns as to whether, ascending to higher altitudes, affects coagulation parameters and INR in warfarin patients. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted using Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, Pubmed, and EBMR <b>multifile.</b> Three studies were chosen based on relevance to the topic. Each study was evaluated using GRADE criteria. Results: Results from all three studies show that increase in altitude changes coagulation parameters indicating of a hypercoagulable state. A retrospective chart review determined that warfarin patients traveling to an altitude of 2400 m had a significantly increased risk of subtherapeutic INR. An observational study on a high altitude expedition showed changes in coagulation parameters resulting in hypercoagulation. A cohort study of subjects ascending to high altitude also showed tendency towards a thrombotic state, especially an increase in fibrinolysis inhibitors, platelets and hemoglobin. Conclusion: The studies show that altitude can change coagulation parameters which contribute to a hypercoagulable state and could decrease INRs of warfarinized patients in whom ascending to altitude increases the risk of thrombosis. The body of evidence was rated as low according to GRADE guidelines. Keywords: Altitude, Coagulation, Anticoagulation, Warfarin, International Normalized Ratio (INR), Hypobaric, Hypoxia...|$|E
40|$|Background: Heart failure {{has a high}} {{mortality}} rate with 20 % dying within {{the first year after}} diagnosis. The gold standard of treatment has been cardiac transplant however the shortage of donors continues to be a problem. Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) have been bridging patients to transplantation, but they come with many complications. The HeartWare HVAD system is a promising new smaller LVAD that will hopefully improve the survival of heart failure patients awaiting transplant. The evidence of the clinical trials in this review was evaluated using the GRADE system. Method: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was conducted using Medline, CINHAL, and Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews <b>Multifile.</b> The terms used in the search included the words, “Heartware, HVAD, and transplant” with limits set for human subjects, the English language, and articles published since the year 2000. After one clinical trial was found the author of that trial was searched to find the second article then included in this review. Results: Two studies were reviewed in this systematic review. Both found that the HeartWare device was effective and safe in bridging end-stage heart failure patients to transplantation. The first study showed survival was 91 % at 180 days and 86 % at one year and the second study showed survival was 90 % at 180 days, 84 % at one year, and 79 % at two years. Conclusion: The HeartWare HVAD system is effective and safe in bridging end-stage heart failure patients to transplantation. Keywords: HeartWare, HVAD, transplant, heart failur...|$|E
40|$|Background: ACE inhibitor-induced {{angioedema}} is a rare, yet potentially fatal, drug side effect. Considering nearly 40 {{million people}} are taking ACE inhibitors for their anti-hypertensive and renal-protective benefits, {{a significant number of}} patients are at risk for this drug-induced angioedema. This review was performed to evaluate the efficacy of icatibant as treatment for ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema. Strength of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE tool. Method: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was conducted using Medline, PubMed, ISI Web of Science, EBM Reviews <b>Multifile,</b> and CINAHL. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. At the time of this review, no randomized control trials were published; therefore, this review focuses on case reports. Results: During the exhaustive literature search, only two case reports were found regarding the use of icatibant as treatment for ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema. Both studies included in the review showed substantial reduction in time to complete resolution of symptoms from ACE inhibitor angioedema using icatibant as compared to standard therapy. Only local-site reactions of erythema and pruritus were evident as side-effects from icatibant therapy. Conclusion: Despite the small sample size of the studies, the overall Moderate GRADE outcome, and the limited statistical significance from these observational reports, icatibant appears to dramatically reduce time to: 1) first symptom improvement, and 2) complete symptom resolution of angioedema, as compared to standard therapy. Therefore, the clinical significance of icatibant as a treatment modality for ACE inhibitor angioedema is noteworthy, and should be further investigated by randomized control trials.

40|$|Background: Atrial {{fibrillation}} is {{a challenging}} medical condition affecting over 2 million Americans today. The cure for atrial fibrillation has been controversial; however, radiofrequency catheter ablation and the Cox maze III procedure have been forerunners as curative therapies for decades. At this time, {{there is no}} medical evidence promoting one therapy over the other using reoccurrence of atrial fibrillation {{and the need for}} additional pharmaceutical therapy as endpoints. Both undesirable outcomes should be the primary measure of long-term efficacy of treatment to determine the gold standard. A systematic review was performed on current clinical evidence and the quality of evidence was evaluated with the GRADE working group tool. Method: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was conducted using EBM Reviews <b>Multifile,</b> Medline and CINAHL databases. Keywords used were atrial fibrillation, radiofrequency catheter ablation, maze and long term. Studies not evaluating atrial fibrillation solely and studies not evaluating radiofrequency catheter ablation and the Cox maze III procedure as primary procedures were excluded from the review. Results: Four observational case series met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Long-term follow-up showed the necessity of repeat ablation procedures for approximately a 50 % cure rate in comparison to over a 90 % cure rate in patients who underwent the Cox maze III procedure once. Conclusion: The Cox maze III, although having a slightly higher risk for mortality, has shown a significantly higher and long-term cure rate. Using the GRADE tool, the studies examined yielded low quality evidence indicating further investigation is warranted with higher quality studies and larger study samples...|$|E
