40|$|<b>Mexican</b> <b>blind</b> {{cavefish}} exhibit an unconditioned wall-following {{behavior in}} response to novel environments. Similar behaviors have been observed {{in a wide variety}} of animals, but the biological significance and evolutionary history of this behavior are largely unknown. In this study, the behaviors of <b>Mexican</b> <b>blind</b> cavefish (Astyanax sp.) and sighted Mexican tetra (Astyanax mexicanus) were videotaped after fish were introduced into a novel environment under dark (infrared) or well-lit conditions. Under dark conditions, both sighted and blind morphs exhibited wall-following behaviors with subtle but significant differences. Blind morphs swam more nearly parallel to the wall, exhibited greater wall-following continuity and reached higher levels of sustained swimming speeds more quickly than sighted morphs. In contrast, sighted morphs in the light remained motionless near the wall for long periods of time or moved slowly around the center of the tank without entraining to the walls. These results are consistent with the idea that wall-following is a shared, primitive trait that serves an exploratory function under dark conditions to compensate for the absence of vision. This behavior has become more honed in blind morphs for exploratory purposes [...] in large part due to the enhanced, active-flow sensing abilities of the lateral line...|$|R

40|$|We examine at the {{cellular}} level the postembryonic {{development of the}} posterior lateral line in the zebrafish. We show that {{the first wave of}} secondary neuromasts is laid down by a migrating primordium, primII. This primordium originates from a cephalic region much like the primordium that formed the primary line during embryogenesis. PrimII contributes to both the lateral and the dorsal branches of the posterior lateral line. Once they are deposited by the primordium, the differentiating neuromasts induce the specialisation of overlying epidermal cells into a pore-forming annulus, and the entire structure begins to migrate ventrally across the epithelium. Thus the final two-dimensional pattern depends on the combination of two orthogonal processes: anteroposterior waves of neuromast formation and dorsoventral migration of individual neuromasts. Finally, we examine how general these migratory processes can be by describing two fish species with very different adult patterns, Astyanax fasciatus (<b>Mexican</b> <b>blind</b> cavefish) and Oryzias latipes (medaka). We show that their primary patterns are nearly identical to that observed in zebrafish embryos, and that their postembryonic growth relies on the same combination of migratory processes that we documented {{in the case of the}} zebrafish...|$|R

40|$|Fishes use {{multimodal}} signals {{during both}} inter- and intra-sexual displays to convey {{information about their}} sex, reproductive state, and social status. These complex behavioral displays can include visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, and hydrodynamic signals, and the relative role of each sensory channel in these complex multi-sensory interactions is a common focus of neuroethology. The mechanosensory lateral line system of fishes detects near-body water movements and is implicated {{in a variety of}} behaviors including schooling, rheotaxis, social communication, and prey detection. Cobalt chloride is commonly used to chemically ablate lateral line neuromasts, thereby eliminating water-movement cues to test for mechanosensory-mediated behavioral functions. However, cobalt acts as a nonspecific calcium channel antagonist and could potentially disrupt function of all superficially located sensory receptor cells, including those for chemosensing. Here, we examined whether CoCl 2 treatment used to ablate the lateral line system also impairs olfaction in three freshwater fishes, the African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni, goldfish Carassius auratus, and the <b>Mexican</b> <b>blind</b> cavefish Astyanax mexicanus. To examine the impact of CoCl 2 on the activity of peripheral receptors, we quantified DASPEI fluorescence intensity of the olfactory epithelium from fish exposed to control and CoCl 2 solutions. In addition, we examined brain activation in olfactory processing regions of A. burtoni immersed in either control or cobalt solutions. All three species exposed to CoCl 2 had decreased DASPEI staining of the olfactory epithelium, and in A. burtoni, cobalt treatment caused reduced neural activation in olfactory processing regions of the brain. To our knowledge this is the first empirical evidence demonstrating that the same CoCl 2 treatment used to ablate the lateral line system also impairs olfactory function. These data have important implications for the use of CoCl 2 in future research and suggest that previous studies using CoCl 2 should be reinterpreted in the context of both impaired mechanoreception and olfaction...|$|R
40|$|Although much is {{now known}} about the {{mechanisms}} that insects, birds and mammals use to orient within familiar areas, our knowledge of such mechanisms in fish is scant. I used the transformational approach to test whether the <b>blind</b> <b>Mexican</b> cave fish can encode shape and size in an internal representation of space. These fish are excellent study animals, as they swim at high velocities (presumably to enhance lateral line organ stimulation) when faced with unfamiliar landmarks or environments. As they are blind, potentially confounding cues from visual global landmarks are unavailable. The fish learnt a square configuration of four landmarks and so must have been be able to encode spatial relationships between the elements within this configuration. After learning landmark arrays, the cave fish showed significant dishabituation (swimming velocity was increased) when exposed to landmark transformations. The fish must therefore have been comparing the environment that they perceived with an internal representation of the environment that they had learnt. The results show that <b>blind</b> <b>Mexican</b> cave fish can encode size (absolute distance between landmarks) and possibly also shape within their spatial maps. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

40|$|Troglobitic (exclusively {{subterranean}}) organisms usually present, {{among their}} apomorphies {{related to the}} subterranean life (troglomorphisms), the regression of eyes and melanic pigmentation. The degree of regression varies among species, from a slight reduction to {{the complete loss of}} eyes and dark pigmentation, without a taxonomic correlation. While mechanisms of eye reduction have been intensively investigated in some troglobites such as the <b>Mexican</b> <b>blind</b> tetra characins, genus Astyanax, and the European salamander, Proteus anguinus, few studies have focused on pigmentation. The Brazilian subterranean ichthyofauna distinguishes not only by the species richness (23 troglobitic fishes so far known) but also by the variation in the degree of reduction of eyes and pigmentation. This study focused on Brazilian fishes completely devoid of melanic pigmentation: the characiform Stygichthys typhlops (Characidae) and the siluriforms Ancistrus formoso (Loricariidae), Rhamdiopsis sp. 1 (Heptapteridae; from caves in the Chapada Diamantina, Bahia) and Rhamdiopsis sp. 2 (cave in Campo Formoso, Bahia). In order to investigate if such depigmentation is the result of blockage in some step in the melanogenesis, in vitro tests of administration of L-DOPA were done, using caudal-fin fragments extracted from living fish. Except for Rhamdiopsis sp. 2, all the studied species were DOPA(+), i. e., melanin was synthesized after L-DOPA administration. This indicates these fish do have melanophores but they are unable to convert L-tyrosine to L-DOPA. On the other hand, Rhamdiopsis sp. 2, like the albino specimens of Trichomycterus itacarambiensis previously studied (which correspond to one third of the population), are DOPA(-), either because the block of melanin synthesis occurs downstream in melanogenesis, which is probably the case with T. itacarambiensis (monogenic system in view of the phenotypic discontinuity), or because the so-called albinos do no possess melanophores. The physiological loss in the ability to synthesize melanin, apparently caused by different genetic processes in DOPA(+) and in DOPA(-) fishes, may co-exist in subterranean populations with a decrease in the density of melanophores, as observed in the pigmented two thirds of T. itacarambiensis population, a morphological reduction apparently controlled by polygenic systems producing a continuous phenotypic variation...|$|R

Its perceptual range (less {{than or equal to}} 0. 05 m) is greatly exceeded by its ecological ranging requirements (ca. 30 m). Although known to possess a spatial map of its environment, it is not known how this fish links places (or the area over which the perceptual range extends) together. Using the blind cave fish's propensity to accelerate when faced with objects or environments that are recognizably different, I used a behavioural assay to test whether fishes can learn and remember the order of a landmark sequence. I show, to my knowledge for the first time, that <b>blind</b> <b>Mexican</b> cave fish can encode order in their spatial map. The ability to represent the order in which a series of places are spatially linked is a powerful tool for animals that must orient beyond the limit of their perceptual range.

40|$|<b>Blind</b> <b>Mexican</b> {{cave fish}} (Astyanax fasciatus) lack a {{functional}} visual system {{and have been}} shown to sense their environment using a technique called hydrodynamic imaging, whereby nearby objects are detected by sensing distortions in the flow field of water around the body using the mechanosensory lateral line. This species has also been noted to touch obstacles, mainly with the pectoral fins, apparently using this tactile information alongside hydrodynamic imaging to sense their surroundings. This study aimed to determine the relative contributions of hydrodynamic and tactile information during wall following behaviour in <b>blind</b> <b>Mexican</b> cave fish. A wall was custom built with a 'netted' region in its centre, which provided very similar tactile information to a solid tank wall, but was undetectable using hydrodynamic imaging. The fish swam significantly closer to and collided more frequently with the netted region of this wall than the solid regions, indicating that the fish did not perceive the netted region as a solid obstacle despite being able to feel it as such with their pectoral fins. We conclude that the touching of objects with the pectoral fins may be an artefact of the intrinsic link between pectoral fin extensions and tail beating whilst swimming, and does not function to gather information. During wall following, hydrodynamic information appears to be used strongly in preference to tactile information in this non-visual system...|$|R

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of adaptation to the cave environment, the <b>blind</b> <b>Mexican</b> cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus, has evolved several cranial aberrations including changes to bone sizes, shapes and presence of numerous lateral asymmetries. Prior studies of cranial asymmetry in cavefish focused strictly on adult specimens. Thus, {{the extent to which}} these asymmetries emerge in adulthood, or earlier in the life history of cavefish, was unknown. We performed a geometric morphometric analysis of shape variation in the chondrocranium and osteocranium across life history in two distinct cavefish populations and surface-dwelling fish. The cartilaginous skull in juveniles was bilaterally symmetric and chondrocranial shape was conserved in all three populations. In contrast, bony skull shapes segregated into significantly distinct groups in adults. Cavefish demonstrated significant asymmetry for the bones surrounding the collapsed eye orbit, and the opercle bone posterior to the eye orbit. Interestingly, we discovered that cavefish also exhibit directional "bends" in skull shape, almost always biased to the left. In sum, this work reveals that asymmetric craniofacial aberrations emerge later in the cavefish life history. These abnormalities may mirror asymmetries in the lateral line sensory system, reflect a 'handedness' in cavefish swimming behavior, or evolve through neutral processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{subterranean}} {{environment is}} often described as "extreme" and food poor. Laboratory experiments have shown that <b>blind</b> <b>Mexican</b> tetra Astyanax mexicanus (De Filippi, 1853) cavefish are better at finding food in the dark than surface fish. Several morphological and behavioural attributes that could foster this obvious adaptive response to cave environments have been described. Nonetheless, it is currently unknown what young cavefish actually eat in their natural cave environment. Our results from the Pachón cave in México during the dry and rainy season show that fry are efficient predators in their natural cave environment. Their primary food item is aquatic crustaceans. The guts of post-larval, pre-juvenile stage individuals (n= 9) contained an average of 17. 9 water fleas (Cladocera), copepods, ostracods, and isopods. Thus, the fry in this cave are well-fed. The Pachón cave environment {{does not appear to be}} "food poor" for juvenile cavefish. Food regimes change between post-larval and adult stages to become more dependent on partially decomposed material, guano, or detritus from the mud.

40|$|In {{apparatus}} {{for measuring}} optomotor behaviour, <b>blind</b> <b>Mexican</b> cave fish, Astyanax hubbsi, increase their swimming velocity upon rotation of a striped cylinder, i. e. {{in response to}} a solely visual stimulus.

Extirpation of the vestigial eye structures does not affect the response to the moving visual stimulus, which indicates that the response is mediated by extra-ocular photoreceptors. An optomotor response can be reliably evoked in a round test aquarium. Fish do not respond when the test aquarium contains environmental cues, such as bars on the wall or when a section of the round aquarium is divided off. This indicates that the fish obtain information about their environment from different sensory sources and that the visual stimulus is effective only when no other means of orientation are available.

40|$|The <b>blind</b> <b>Mexican</b> tetra fish, Astyanax mexicanus, {{has become}} the most {{influential}} model for research of cave adapted organisms. Many authors assume that the Sierra de Guatemala populations and the Sierra de El Abra populations are derived from two independent colonizations. This assumption arises in part from biogeography. The 100 m high, 100 m wide Servilleta Canyon of the Boquillas River separates both mountain ranges and is an apparent barrier for troglobite dispersion. Anelpistina quinterensis (Nicoletiidae, Zygentoma, Insecta) {{is one of the most}} troglomorphic nicoletiid silverfish insects ever described. 16 S rRNA sequences support that this species migrated underground to reach both mountain ranges within less than 12, 000 years. Furthermore, literature shows a plethora of aquatic and terrestrial cave restricted species that inhabit both mountain ranges. Thus, the Servilleta canyon has not been an effective biological barrier that prevented underground migration of troglobites between the Sierra de Guatemala and the Sierra de El Abra. The Boquillas River has changed its course throughout time. Caves that in the past connected the two Sierras were only recently geologically truncated by the erosion of the new river course. It is likely that, with the geological changes of the area and throughout the 2 - 8 million years of evolutionary history of cave Astyanax, there have been opportunities to migrate across the Servilleta canyon...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of degenerate characteristics remains a poorly understood phenomenon. Only recently has {{the identification of}} mutations underlying regressive phenotypes become accessible {{through the use of}} genetic analyses. Focusing on the Mexican cave tetra Astyanax mexicanus, we describe, here, an analysis of the brown mutation, which was first described in the literature nearly 40 years ago. This phenotype causes reduced melanin content, decreased melanophore number, and brownish eyes in convergent cave forms of A. mexicanus. Crosses demonstrate non-complementation of the brown phenotype in F 2 individuals derived from two independent cave populations: Pachón and the linked Yerbaniz and Japonés caves, indicating the same locus is responsible for reduced pigmentation in these fish. While the brown mutant phenotype arose prior to the fixation of albinism in Pachón cave individuals, it is unclear whether the brown mutation arose before or after the fixation of albinism in the linked Yerbaniz/Japonés caves. Using a QTL approach combined with sequence and functional analyses, we have discovered that two distinct genetic alterations in the coding sequence of the gene Mc 1 r cause reduced pigmentation associated with the brown mutant phenotype in these caves. Our analysis identifies a novel role for Mc 1 r in the {{evolution of}} degenerative phenotypes in <b>blind</b> <b>Mexican</b> cavefish. Further, the brown phenotype has arisen independently in geographically separate caves, mediated through different mutations of the same gene.

40|$|Fish orient {{by using}} a memorized map of their {{surroundings}} and, as they live in aquatic environments, this map must be three dimensional. Studies have shown that fish are able to encode horizontal information; however, we have little information about the cues that are learnt and remembered in the vertical axis. We used the <b>blind</b> <b>Mexican</b> cave fish, Astyanax fasciatus, to test whether fish can orient in the vertical axis and whether they use hydrostatic pressure to do so. After learning the cues associated with a specific height in the aquarium (evident by a reduction in swimming speed), the fish showed significant dishabituation (their swimming speed increased) when moved vertically upwards. When we controlled for the increase in light intensity from the bottom {{to the top of}} the tank the effect persisted, indicating that the most likely cue used by the fish to orient vertically was hydrostatic pressure. A post hoc experiment revealed that the change in swimming speed in response to altered light levels probably represents a change in the level of activity rather than an orientational response. This may define a photokinetic mechanism which operates in conjunction with a negatively phototactic response (revealed in previous experiments) by which the fish orient away from higher light levels and swim faster as light levels increase. This would result in the fish spending more time in lower light levels and would prevent the fish exiting the cave. © 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Understanding the genetic basis for these traits has recently become feasible thanks to production of a genome-wide linkage map and quantitative trait association analyses. The selection of suitable candidate genes controlling quantitative traits remains challenging, however, {{in the absence of a}} physical genome. Here, we describe the integration of multiple linkage maps generated in four separate crosses between surface, cave, and hybrid forms of A. mexicanus. We performed exhaustive BLAST analyses of genomic markers populating this integrated map against sequenced genomes of numerous taxa, ranging from yeast to amniotes. We found the largest number of identified sequences (228), with the most expect (E) values < 10 − 5 (95), in the zebrafish Danio rerio. The most significant hits were assembled into an “anchored” linkage map with Danio, revealing numerous regions of conserved synteny, many of which are shared across critical regions of identified quantitative trait loci (QTL). Using this anchored map, we predicted the positions of 21 test genes on the integrated linkage map and verified that 18 of these are found in locations homologous to their chromosomal positions in D. rerio. The anchored map allowed the identification of four candidate genes for QTL relating to rib number and eye size. The map we have generated will greatly accelerate the production of viable lists of additional candidate genes involved in the development and evolution of cave-specific traits in A. mexicanus...|$|R
40|$|While {{the vast}} {{majority}} of underwater vehicles rely exclusively on sonar and vision to detect obstacles and maneuver, live fish also use their lateral line organ. The role played by the canal lateral line system is particularly important for hypogean fish, such as <b>blind</b> <b>Mexican</b> cave fish, who use it to avoid obstacles and navigate dexterously in complex environments. Similarly, pressure sensors could be used on underwater vehicles to expand their range of operability by filling the gap left by sonar and vision systems in turbid cluttered environments. To understand how much information can be extracted from the artificial lateral line of an underwater vehicle exploring an unknown environment, the case of a foil passing a static object in still water is analyzed. A two-dimensional potential flow approach based on a source panels method is used to characterize the spatio-temporal pressure signature of the object as sensed by the vehicle. Simulations are used to estimate the sensing range of an artificial lateral line and the appropriate density of pressure sensors. To emulate the object-detection and shape-recognition capabilities of the lateral line, an adapted unscented Kalman filter is combined with the hydrodynamic model. The method developed is experimentally tested in a water tank, using a hydrofoil instrumented with pressure sensors passing a static cylinder. The results show that location and shape informations of an elliptical cylinder can be successfully inferred from experimental pressure measurements. Performance of the proposed method for object identification using pressure sensors are discussed and ways to improve it are suggested. by Audrey Maertens. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Abstract Background The loss of {{phenotypic}} characters is {{a common}} feature of evolution. Cave organisms provide excellent models for investigating the underlying patterns and processes governing the evolutionary loss of phenotypic traits. The <b>blind</b> <b>Mexican</b> cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus, represents a particularly strong model for both developmental and genetic analyses as these fish can be raised in the laboratory and hybridized with conspecific surface form counterparts to produce large F 2 pedigrees. As studies have begun to illuminate the genetic bases for trait evolution in these cavefish, {{it has become increasingly}} important to understand these phenotypic changes within the context of cavefish origins. Understanding these origins is a challenge. For instance, widespread convergence on similar features renders morphological characters less informative. In addition, current and past gene flow between surface and cave forms have complicated the delineation of particular cave populations. Results Past population-level analyses have sought to: 1) estimate at what time in the geological past cave forms became isolated from surface-dwelling ancestors, 2) define the extent to which cave form populations originated from a common invasion (single origin hypothesis) or several invasions (multiple origin hypothesis), and 3) clarify the role of geological and climatic events in Astyanax cavefish evolution. In recent years, thanks to the combined use of morphological and genetic data, a much clearer picture has emerged regarding the origins of Astyanax cavefish. Conclusions The consensus view, based on several recent studies, is that cave forms originated from at least two distinct ancestral surface-dwelling stocks over the past several million years. In addition, each stock gave rise to multiple invasions of the subterranean biotope. The older stock is believed to have invaded the El Abra caves at least three times while the new stock separately invaded the northern Guatemala and western Micos caves. This renewed picture of Astyanax cavefish origins will help investigators draw conclusions regarding the evolution of phenotypic traits through parallelism versus convergence. Additionally, it will help us understand how the presence of cave-associated traits in old versus young cave populations may be influenced by the time since isolation in the cave environment. This will, in turn, help to inform our broader understanding of the forces that govern the evolution of phenotypic loss. </p...|$|R
