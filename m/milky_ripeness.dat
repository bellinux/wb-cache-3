40|$|The {{discovery}} of aquaporins {{has provided a}} new basis for studying and interpreting water relations in plants. However, slow {{progress has been made}} in elucidating the functional. facets of the aquaporin-mediated water pathway in whole plant systems. White increasing experimental evidence suggests that these proteins are directly involved in mediating water homeostasis at varying environmental conditions, only a few attempts have been made to understand their contribution to overall water transport at different devetopmental stages. By using a chemical inhibitor (HgCl 2) Of aquaporins function, here we present in planta evidence for both diurnal and developmental regulation of aquaporin activity in wheat. We demonstrate that the greatest sensitivity of water flux to pharmacological blockage occurs at the stage of ear emergence and does not coincide with the phenological. stage at which the greatest plant water uptake occurs (<b>milky</b> <b>ripeness).</b> The relationship transpiration flux (Q) vs. soil-leaf water potential difference (Delta Psi(soil-leaves)) revealed a gradual decrease of plant resistance to water flux from tittering to <b>milky</b> <b>ripeness,</b> both in HgCl 2 -treated and untreated control plants. However, the mercury-inhibition of water flux began to gradually increase at ear emergence, suggesting that a larger portion of water moves through aquaporins from this developmental stage on. Although the intercept of the Delta Psi(soil-leaves) /Q regression line, i. e. the Delta Psi required to initiate the water flux through the soil-plant-air continuum, was generally not affected by mercury treatment, a significant mercury effect on the intercept was observed at the stage of ear formation. These findings may have important implications for predicting which strategy plants utilize to optimize water use during their life cycle...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} winter wheat internodes was studied under optimal and deficit support of mineral {{nutrition}} main elements – nitrogen, phosphor and potassium. The most intensive growth of wheat internodes was detected in booting phase {{but under the}} optimal nutrition it was continued to <b>milky</b> <b>ripeness</b> phase. Under mineral nutrition deficit internodes growth stopped in earing-flowering phase. The smallest internodes were formed in wheat cv. ‘Favoritka’. The growth of fourth and fifth internodes started at booting phase. The minimal influence of mineral nutrition was on internodes sizes of cv. ‘Mironivska 808 ’. Winter wheat plants of cvs. ‘Mironivska 808 ’, ‘Smuglyanka’ and‘Favoritka’under mineral deficit nutrition formed larger leaves under last leaves. The largest area of leaves under last leaves was detected in wheat cvs. ‘Mironivska 808 ’and ‘Smuglyanka’...|$|E
40|$|Total {{content of}} {{polyphenols}} {{was investigated in}} different anatomical parts of amaranth during different growth periods. Five amaranth cultivars {{were included in the}} experiment (Amaranthus hypochondriacus L. : cultivars Annapurna and Koniz, Amaranthus caudatus L. : cultivar Oscar Blanco, Amaranthus cruentus L. : cultivars Golden Giant and Rawa). Analysis were done in 4 growth phases: phase I. – intensive stem growth, phase II. – formation of the flowers and pollination, phase III. – <b>milky</b> <b>ripeness,</b> phase IV. – full ripeness. Based on the determined total polyphenol content in amaranth it is possible to create this anatomical part order: leaves > flowers > seeds > stems. No statistically significant differences were confirmed between phases I., III. and IV. On the other hand the total polyphenol content in amaranth determined in growth phase II. was significantly different in comparison to other growth phases. Statistically significant differences in polyphenolic content were confirmed between all investigated anatomical parts of amaranth...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of temperature on tannin synthesis in different development and ripening phases of buckwheat seeds was studied. The seeds were ripening in growth chambers and exposed to different temperatures. In one chamber {{the temperature was}} 15 °C through 24 hours, in the second the temperature was kept at 25 °C for 16 hours and at 15 °C for 8 hours. The plants were exposed to 60,uE m- 2 S- 1 light for 16 hours and {{kept in the dark}} for 8 hours daily. Tha tannin content was analysed by use of the vanillin-HCl method in various phases of seed formation and ripening. A constant temperature 25 °C from <b>milky</b> to full <b>ripeness</b> had a negative effect on the synthesis and deposition of tannin in buckwheat seeds. In plants grown at 25 °C/ 15 °C, the tannin content manifested a growing trend. As early as the 5 th to 8 th day from pollination, tannin was detected in forming seeds...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} work evaluates {{the development of}} roots and shoots in wheat grown after sugarbeet and as continuous crop, with and without mineral fertilization. The root and shoot development was evaluated {{in the course of}} the growth cycle at the beginning and at the end of tillering, at flowering, at <b>milky</b> <b>ripeness</b> and at full maturity. The length of roots was measured following the Newman method, on soil auger samples taken in the space between rows down to 0. 8 m depth. Data showed a different development both of shoots and roots and a different root distribution along the soil profile. In the sugarbeet-wheat rotation a greater yield was observed for both shoots and roots. In particular, a greater root development was observed in deeper layers during the whole growth cycle and reduced persistence during maturity in the top layers. Also fertilization had positive effects on the development of the whole plant; the effect on roots was evident with a greater development of shallow roots and a reduction on the deeper ones, especially after flowering. Also the shoot/root ratio was influenced by the examined factors...|$|E
40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the {{analysis}} of the damages which were caused by wild boar on farming plants in the region of Milevsko. Three areas of interest were chosen for the observation (the area around Sepekov, Přeštenice and Opařany). Each of the areas of interest observed was chosen because of its conditions suitable for the occurrence of wild boar during whole year. Each area had also ideal conditions for evaluating of the damages caused by this species on farming plants. The main aim of this diploma thesis was appraisal of the damages caused by wild boar according to the most suitable Czech and foreign methodologies. The observation was realized in the period from the beginning of February 2011 to the end of October 2011. The size of the damages on particular farming lands was measured according to three Czech methodologies (according to Dvořák et al., 2006). Total evaluation of the damages caused by wild boar on farming plants was realized according to Czech methodology by Kamler and two foreign methodologies (by Jonathan Yoder and Ray T. Sterner). The biggest damages caused by wild boar were found out in the area around Sepekov. The most attractive and also the most damaged farming plant was maize in the region of Milevsko. The damages of permanent grass cover caused by rooting of wild boar were found out only in spring term. Winter grains were mostly damaged by wild boar in the period of <b>milky</b> <b>ripeness.</b> In case of the usage of the methodologies for finding out the amount of damaged area it was necessary to choose the methodology according to the kind of a farming plant, the height of a plant and the kind of the damage. All three types of the methodologies used for finding out the total amount of damages caused by wild boar on farming plants were very exact and applicable to the chosen region...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{tightly bound}} to DNA {{proteins}} (TBPs) is a protein group that remains attached to DNA with covalent or non-covalent bonds after its deproteinisation. The functional role {{of this group}} is as yet not completely understood. The main goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate tissue specific changes in the TBP distribution in barley genes and chromosomes in different phases of shoot and seed development. We have: 1. investigated the TBP distribution along Amy 32 b and Bmy 1 genes encoding low pI α-amylase A and endosperm specific β-amylase correspondingly using oligonucleotide DNA arrays; 2. characterized the polypeptide spectrum of TBP and proteins with affinity to TBP-associated DNA; 3. localized the distribution of DNA complexes with TBP (TBP-DNA) on barley 1 H and 7 H chromosomes using mapped markers; 4. compared the chromosomal distribution of TBP-DNA complexes to the distribution of the nuclear matrix attachment sites. Results In the Amy 32 b gene transition from watery ripe to the <b>milky</b> <b>ripeness</b> stage of seed development was followed by the decrease of TBP binding along the whole gene, especially in the promoter region and intron II. Expression of the Bmy 1 gene coupled to ripening was followed by release of the exon III and intron III sequences from complexes with TBPs. Marker analysis revealed changes in the association of chromosome 1 H and 7 H sites with TBPs between first leaf and coleoptile and at Zadoks 07 and Zadoks 10 stages of barley shoot development. Tight DNA-protein complexes of the nuclear matrix and those detected by NPC-chromatography were revealed as also involved in tissue- and development-dependent transitions, however, in sites different from TBP-DNA interactions. The spectrum of TBPs appeared to be organ and developmental-stage specific. Development of the first leaf and root system (from Zadoks 07 to Zadoks 10 stage) was shown as followed by a drastic increase in the TBP number in contrast to coleoptile, where the TBPs spectrum became poor during senescence. It was demonstrated that a nuclear protein of low molecular weight similar to the described TBPs possessed a high affinity to the DNA involved in TBP-DNA complexes. Conclusion Plant development is followed by redistribution of TBP along individual genes and chromosomes. </p...|$|E
