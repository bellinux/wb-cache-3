5|$|Upon {{completion}} of the Story Mode, players are assigned a number of points determined by their performance, with a maximum of one hundred. Using those points, the player is given the option of creating a racer with customized color and performance. The point value is distributed among five parameters: <b>Max</b> <b>Speed,</b> Acceleration, Grip, Drift, and A.G.S., which determines how fast the racer's ability gauge charges. A maximum of twenty points can be assigned {{to each of the}} five racing parameters. Customized racers can be used in all of the game's modes except for the Story Mode, and only the main characters and Bahamut are open to customization.|$|E
5|$|Players {{have access}} to a {{communication}} system {{that can be used to}} contact other starfighters, which has more impact in the game's single-player mode. Through the system, the player can order either a single starfighter, a wing, or all craft (depending on how many are still active), with tasks such as taking down a player's target, covering the player, or engaging all hostiles, amongst other commands. The system can also be used to call in for reinforcements (if available), and requesting deployment of a support ship to repair a player's subsystems as well as re-arm their secondary weapons; the support ship can be given limited orders when deployed. Furthermore, a player can manage the energy input of certain subsystems, thus affecting how efficient it is in battle; changing the input for engines, for example, changes the <b>max</b> <b>speed</b> of the craft and the time needed to fully recharge the ship's afterburners. The controls for the game in both modes are designed so that players have ease with controlling their starfighter and its systems, and be able to do so with either a joystick, or a keyboard (on its own or with a mouse). Because of the flexibility in controls, some have categorised Descent: FreeSpace as a flight simulator, since it has more controls and commands than a typical arcade game, yet its flight model is simple, akin to that of the game , and incorporates some elements of Newtonian physics such as precise collision physics.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem that}} is slowing down {{high-speed}} rail in Sweden is the present signaling system (ATC), which does not allow speeds over 200km/h. It can be upgraded, {{but it will not}} be done since it shall be replaced by the European signaling system ERTMS level 2 on major lines in the near future, allowing high speeds up to 250km/h. ERTMS level 2 has been installed and is being tried out on Botniabanan, and that railway allows 250km/h, although no passenger train goes above 200 for now. The train set X55-Regina has been delivered to the rail company SJ with the <b>max</b> <b>speed</b> of 200km/h but with the option to upgrade the EMU to 250km/h when possible.

25|$|Brake discs and pads require {{sometime}} {{to adhere}} to each other smoothly. The pads need to deposit an even transfer layer. For street and urban driving with new pads and rotors {{it is best to}} treat them as a break in period as you would a new car for 200 to 300 miles after this period the manufactures bedding procedure can be followed. This is typically some number of stops from a certain <b>max</b> <b>speed</b> to a minimum speed. For example 10 moderate stops from 60 mph to 10mph in a safe controlled environment where no hazards are present. The goal is to get the brake pads and brake discs hot. During this time it is ideal to keep the brake pressure and stops consistent without engaging the Anti lock braking system or skidding the tires. There will likely be smells and a light amount of smoke. This is normal. Once the brakes begin to suffer from fade(braking effectiveness slightly reduced) the process is complete. Continue to drive at moderate speeds to cool the brake discs and rotors avoiding the use of the brakes unless needed for emergency situations. Also take note when coming to a complete stop until everything has cooled not to hold your foot on the brakes which could create an imprint.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to conduct}} {{researches}} on {{the correlation between}} driver safety consciousness and several indices, and propose an objective evaluation criterion, which can covert immeasurable safety consciousness to measurable objective indices. A number of taxi drivers were selected as study subjects, and their safety consciousness was evaluated by using fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. Combined {{with the number of}} accidents these drivers involve in a year, the correlation between driver safety consciousness and accident numbers was investigated. And combined with GPS surveillance data, the correlation between driver safety consciousness and the mean speed, <b>speed</b> dispersion, and <b>max</b> vehicle <b>speed</b> was analyzed. Then the identification model between <b>max</b> vehicle <b>speed</b> and driver safety consciousness level was established. The results show that driver safety consciousness level is correlated with accident numbers, and not correlated with the mean speed, correlated with vehicle speed dispersion, and highly correlated with <b>max</b> vehicle <b>speed.</b> According to fuzzy identification model, <b>max</b> vehicle <b>speed</b> obtained from statistics circle can be used to evaluate and categorize driver safety consciousness. Verification shows that the driver safety consciousness evaluation model, which based on the <b>max</b> vehicle <b>speed,</b> is effective. It can overcome the demerits of scale evaluation, effectively identify driver safety consciousness level, and provide guidance for driver safety education, management and training...|$|R
