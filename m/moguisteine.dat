40|$|Action of <b>moguisteine</b> on the {{activity}} of tracheobronchial rapidly adapting receptors in the dog G. Sant'Ambrogio, F. B. Sant'Ambrogio aa <b>Moguisteine</b> is an antitussive agent with a novel chemi-cal structure [1]. Its pharmacological activity has been test-ed on experimental animals and in several clinical trials. In guinea-pigs, <b>moguisteine</b> was found to reduce cough elicited by citric acid inhalation and electrical stimulation of the airway mucosa as effectively as codeine and dex-tromethorphan [2]. <b>Moguisteine,</b> injected into the cereb-ral ventricles of guinea-pigs, does not inhibit electrically stimulated cough, which is, instead, effectively blocked by intraventricular codeine: {{these findings suggest that}} the antitussive action of <b>moguisteine</b> depends on a periphera...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT-We {{investigated}} whether inhaled pinacidil and <b>moguisteine</b> inhibit capsaicin-induced coughs in guinea pigs. Inhaled pinacidil (1 5 - 60 pg/ml), an ATP-sensitive K+ channel opener, and <b>moguisteine</b> (1 5 - 60 pglml) each dose-dependently inhibited {{the number}} of capsaicin-induced coughs. The antitussive effects of pinacidil and <b>moguisteine</b> were significantly antagonized by pretreatment with glibenclamide (10 mg/kg, i. p.), an ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker. However, pretreatment with naloxone methiodide (10 mg/kg, s. c.) had no {{significant effect on the}} antitussive effects of either pinacidil or <b>moguisteine.</b> On the other hand, inhaled dihydrocodeine (1 5 - 60 pg/ml) also dose-dependently suppressed {{the number of}} capsaicin-induced coughs. The antitussive effect of inhaled dihydrocodeine was significantly antagonized by pretreatment with naloxone methiodide (I O mglkg, s. c.), but not by glibenclamide (I O mglkg, i. p.). These results indicate that inhaled pinacidil and <b>moguisteine</b> both attenuate capsaicin-induced coughs. Pinacidil and <b>moguisteine</b> may exert their antitussive effects through the activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels in the tracheobronchial tract. Furthermore, it is possible that ATP-sensitive K+ chanuels may be involved in the antitussive effects of peripherally acting non-narcotic antitussive drugs...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Cough is {{a common}} symptom of {{respiratory}} diseases associated with irritation or inflammation of the airways, and symptomatic antitussive drugs are frequently prescribed to control an abnormal cough reflex. Our aim was to eval-uate the effects of <b>moguisteine,</b> a novel, peripheral, nonnarcotic antitussive agent, on airway inflammation induced in guinea-pigs {{with a variety of}} stimuli. These stimuli included exposure to tobacco smoke for 10 min, to elicit airway hyperreactivity, eosinophil recruitment in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), airway epithelial damage and plasma exudation; graded platelet-activating factor (PAF) infusion (600 ngÂ·kg- 1 over one h), to induce airway hyperreactivity; 2 % ovalbumin (OA) aerosol challenge in 1 % OA-sensitized animals, to induce late-phase (17 and 72 h) airway leucocyte accumulation. We also assessed the activity of <b>moguisteine</b> on plasma leakage induced by capsaicin, on bronchoconstriction induced by acetyl-choline (ACh), histamine (H) and PAF, and on leukotriene mediated allergic bron-chospasm in OA-sensitized guinea-pig. <b>Moguisteine</b> (p. o. and i. m.) and dexamethasone (p. o. and i. m.) dose-dependentl...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a multicentre, double-blind, parallel group study {{to compare the}} clinical efficacy of a new antitussive drug, <b>moguisteine</b> (100 mg t. i. d.), {{to that of a}} reference standard, codeine (15 and 30 mg, t. i. d.). Both drugs were given orally for a period of two days. A group of 119 patients (mean age 54 yrs; 61 females and 58 males) with chronic, dry or slightly productive cough, associated with various respiratory disorders (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory malignancies and pulmonary fibrosis) were enrolled at six participating centres. The percentage {{reduction in the number of}} morning coughs over a period of 6 h after the first administered dose compared to baseline assessment, was 21 % with <b>moguisteine</b> (n = 39), 28 % with codeine 15 mg (n = 38), and 29 % with codeine 30 mg (n = 36). Differences between treatments were not significant. The percentage reduction in the number of nocturnal coughs per hour, after the last evening dose compared to baseline assessment, was 33, 46 and 52 %, respectively. Subjective assessments (patients' visual analogue scale scores of cough frequency, cough intensity and sleep disturbance, and investigators' ranking of cough severity) indicated that there was a similar improvement in cough symptoms in all treatment groups. Adverse events were observed in two patients on <b>moguisteine,</b> three on codeine 15 mg, and five on codeine 30 mg. No event was serious, but discontinuation of treatment was required in two patients on codeine 30 mg. The results of our study suggest that <b>moguisteine</b> 100 mg t. i. d. is safe, and seems to have an antitussive activity similar to that of codeine 15 - 30 mg t. i. d...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Although the {{mechanism}} of fentanyl-induced cough is unclear, several lines of evidence suggest that allergic mediators, such as histamine, {{may play a role}} in the production of fentanyl-induced coughs. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of fentanyl on cough sensitivity to inhaled citric acid and on histamine release in BALF in mice. Methods The cough reflex was induced by the inhalation of citric acid. Male ICR mice were exposed to a nebulized solution of citric acid at a concentration of 0. 1 [*]M under conscious and identical conditions using a body plethysmograph. The number of coughs produced per 3 -min period of exposure to citric acid was counted. Histamine content in BALF was analyzed by HPLC post-column derivatization and fluorescence detection. Results Intravenous administration of fentanyl increased the number of citric acid-induced coughs. The fentanyl-induced enhancement of the number of citric acid-induced coughs was abolished in mice that had been pretreated with <b>moguisteine,</b> a rapidly adapting receptor (RAR) antagonist or fexofenadine, a histamine H 1 receptor antagonist. Fentanyl significantly increased the concentration of histamine in BALF. Conclusion The results of this study suggest that fentanyl enhances the excitability of RARs to cause cough, and enhancement of histamine release in the airways may some how be related to this change. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Cough {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{symptoms}} for which patients seek medical attention from primary care physicians and pulmonologists. Cough is an important defensive reflex that enhances the clearance of secretions and particles from the airways and protects the lower airways from the aspiration of foreign materials. Therapeutic suppression of cough may be either disease-specific or symptom related. The potential benefits of an early treatment of cough could include the prevention of the vicious cycle of cough. There has been a long tradition in acute cough, which is frequently due to upper respiratory tract infections, to use symptom-related anti-tussives. Suppression of cough (during chronic cough) may be achieved by disease-specific therapies, but in many patients it is often necessary to use symptomatic anti-tussives, too. According to the current guidelines of the American College of Chest Physician on "Cough Suppressants and Pharmacologic Protussive Therapy" and additional clinical trials on the most frequent anti-tussive drugs, it should be possible to diagnose and treat cough successfully in a majority of cases. Among drugs used for the symptomatic treatment of cough, peripherally acting anti-tussives such as levodropropizine and <b>moguisteine</b> show the highest level of benefit and should be recommended especially in children. By improving our understanding of the specific effects of these anti-tussive agents, the therapeutic use of these drugs may be refined. The present review provides a summary of the most clinically relevant anti-tussive drugs in addition to their potential mechanism of action. </p...|$|E
