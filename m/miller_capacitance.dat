2500|$|To {{combat the}} {{stability}} problems and limited voltage gain {{due to the}} Miller effect, the physicist Walter H. Schottky invented the tetrode tube in 1919. He showed that {{the addition of a}} second grid, located between the control grid and the plate (anode), known as the screen grid, could solve these problems. ("Screen" [...] in this case refers to electrical [...] "screening" [...] or shielding, not physical construction: all [...] "grid" [...] electrodes in between the cathode and plate are [...] "screens" [...] of some sort rather than solid electrodes since they must allow for the passage of electrons directly from the cathode to the plate). A positive voltage slightly lower than the plate (anode) voltage was applied to it, and was bypassed (for high frequencies) to ground with a capacitor. This arrangement decoupled the anode and the control grid, essentially eliminating the <b>Miller</b> <b>capacitance</b> and its associated problems. Consequently, higher voltage gains from a single tube became possible, reducing the number of tubes required in many circuits. This two-grid tube is called a tetrode, meaning four active electrodes, and was common by 1926.|$|E

50|$|The major {{advantage}} of this circuit arrangement stems from {{the placement of the}} upper field-effect transistor (FET) as the load of the input (lower) FET's output terminal (drain). Because at operating frequencies the upper FET's gate is effectively grounded, the upper FET's source voltage (and therefore the input transistor's drain) is held at nearly constant voltage during operation. In other words, the upper FET exhibits a low input resistance to the lower FET, making the voltage gain of the lower FET very small, which dramatically reduces the <b>Miller</b> feedback <b>capacitance</b> from the lower FET's drain to gate. This loss of voltage gain is recovered by the upper FET. Thus, the upper transistor permits the lower FET to operate with minimal negative (Miller) feedback, improving its bandwidth.|$|R
40|$|A {{resonant}} reset forward converter {{was developed}} {{as one of}} the topologies of the forward converter because it offered the simplest technique of transformer core resetting. The resonant reset topology does not require any external passive components or any tertiary winding to facilitate the core reset but it utilizes the magnetizing inductance of the transformer and the parasitic capacitances of the devices to bring down the core flux to its initial position and hence avoids core saturation of the transformer, which is the principle working device in the converter {{from the point of view}} of electrical isolation and reproduction of good quality dc voltage at the output (or the load). The saturation of the transformer would have otherwise led to heavy inrush current resulting in huge losses and degradation in efficiency of the converter. Thus in a low power dc-dc converter this resonant reset topology of the forward converter offers significant advantages. The small signal model of the converter which was proposed using the switch averaging method was validated using the software PSPICE and it gave perfect ripple free dc waveform at the output. The closed loop stage involved the development of a type IIIB controller to generate a sufficient phase margin and hence improve stability. The Optocoupler was also used in the feedback for the purpose of maintaining the electrical isolation and the pole which it generated (due to <b>Miller’s</b> <b>capacitance)</b> was compensated by manually placing a combination of a parallel resistor and capacitor at the output of the collector terminals of the transistor of the Optocoupler. Finally the hardware developments were done for the voltage mode controlled feedback loop using IC UC 3525 A which gave satisfactory results for various load tests and desired input voltage fluctuations...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design of}} RF CMOS circuits required for integrated transceivers, including a downconversion mixer, an image-rejection upconversion mixer and a Q-enhanced LC bandpass filter. The downconversion mixer has a simple architecture consisting of a cross-coupled pair and two source-followers as the core. The mixing property is superior due to the characteristics of unbalanced source-coupled pairs. It is also insensitive to both device mismatches as well as body effect. Independence {{of the first two}} poles allows the input and output bandwidth to be optimized separately. Both downconversion and upconversion mixers have been fabricated in a 0. 8 μm CMOS process. Experimentally, the downconversion mixer achieves an input bandwidth of 1 GHz at which IIP 3 of 23. 5 dBm is measured. Its conversion loss and 1 -dB compression point are measured to be 4. 4 dBm and 14. 5 dBm, respectively. It occupies an active die area of 100 μm x 100 μm, and consumes 2. 5 mW from a single 2. 6 V supply. The image-rejection upconversion mixer is formed by a parallel connection of two identical mixers which have a similar architecture as the downconversion one. The image-rejection property is a consequence of selectively canceling the signals in the unwanted sideband. Within the input bandwidth of 600 MHz, the measured gain mismatches between individual channel is less than 1 dB with a conversion gain of - 11 dB. At this frequency, the l-dB compression point is 11 dBm, and the IIP 3 is 22. 5 dBm. It dissipates 20 mW from a 3. 3 V power supply. Its active area is 290 μm X 150 μm. The classical LC bandpass filter is implemented in CMOS technology using lossy monolithic inductors. It has a fully differential structure with a tunable quality factor using negative resistances and a variable centre frequency based on <b>Miller</b> <b>capacitances.</b> The filter's centre frequency can be varied from 820 MHz to 930 MHz with an adjustable Q-factor up to 880 in the post-simulation. The simulated peak conversion gain is 42 dB. The IIP 3 is - 38 dBm when the Q-factor is 650 and the centre frequency is 900 MHz. Its nominal supply voltage is 3 V with a current consumption of 40 mA, and it occupies an active area of 740 μm x 840 μm...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the term}} Miller effect {{normally}} refers to capacitance, any impedance connected between the input and another node exhibiting gain can modify the amplifier input impedance via this effect.

5000|$|This gain formula {{appears to}} show a simple two-pole {{response}} with two time constants.

Ordinarily these effects show up only at frequencies much higher than the roll-off due to the <b>Miller</b> <b>capacitance,</b> so the analysis presented here is adequate to determine the useful frequency range of an amplifier dominated by the Miller effect.|$|E
50|$|The {{parasitic}} capacitance between the {{input and output}} electrodes of inverting amplifying devices, such as between the base and collector of transistors, is particularly troublesome because it is multiplied by the gain of the device. This <b>Miller</b> <b>capacitance</b> (first noted in vacuum tubes by John Milton Miller, 1920) is the major factor limiting the high frequency performance of active devices like transistors and vacuum tubes. The screen grid was added to triode vacuum tubes in the 1920s to reduce {{parasitic capacitance}} between the control grid and the plate, creating the tetrode, {{which resulted in a}} great increase in operating frequency.|$|E
5000|$|It is also {{important}} to note that the <b>Miller</b> <b>capacitance</b> is the capacitance seen looking into the input.

However if the amplifier has a high impedance output, such as if a gain stage is also the output stage, then this RC can have a significant impact on the performance of the amplifier. This is when pole splitting techniques are used.|$|E
50|$|This example also assumes Av is {{frequency}} independent, {{but more}} generally there is frequency {{dependence of the}} amplifier contained implicitly in Av. Such frequency dependence of Av also makes the <b>Miller</b> <b>capacitance</b> frequency dependent, so interpretation of CM as a capacitance becomes more difficult. However, ordinarily any frequency dependence of Av arises only at frequencies {{much higher than the}} roll-off with frequency caused by the Miller effect, so for frequencies up to the Miller-effect roll-off of the gain, Av is accurately approximated by its low-frequency value. Determination of CM using Av at low frequencies is the so-called Miller approximation. With the Miller approximation, CM becomes frequency independent, and its interpretation as a capacitance at low frequencies is secure.|$|E
