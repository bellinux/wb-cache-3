Due {{to the complexity of}} surface topography, accurate surface characterisation requires three-dimensional (3 D) <b>surface</b> <b>measurements</b> not provided by many current measurement systems. A nondestructive and versatile technique for quantifying 3 D surface features is Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM).

40|$|Using a local {{plane wave}} assumption, one can {{determine}} the normal incidence sound absorption coefficient of a surface by measuring the acoustic pressure and the particle velocity normal to that surface. As the <b>measurement</b> <b>surface</b> lies {{in front of the}} material surface, the measured active and incident acoustic power will generally deviate from those at the material surface, leading to a possibly inaccurate sound absorption coefficient. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced for poorly absorbing surfaces if sound is not normally incident over the whole material surface. Based on an analytical model, it is shown that the accuracy can be improved by extending the <b>measurement</b> <b>surface</b> upon which the active acoustic power is measured. Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, in particular for poorly absorbing surfaces...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} fiber {{orientation}} on vis/NIR light propagation were studied in three bovine muscles: biceps brachii, brachialis and soleus. Broadband light was focused onto the sample and the diffuse reflectance spot was captured using a hyperspectral camera (470 - 1620 nm), after which rhombuses were fitted to equi-intensity points. In samples with fibers running {{parallel to the}} <b>measurement</b> <b>surface,</b> the rhombus’ major axis was oriented perpendicular to the fiber direction close {{to the point of}} illumination. However, at larger distances from the illumination spot, the major axis orientation aligned with the fiber direction. This phenomenon was found to be muscle dependent. Furthermore, the rhombus orientation was highly dependent on the sample positioning underneath the camera, especially when the muscle fibers ran parallel to the <b>measurement</b> <b>surface.</b> The bias parameter, indicating the deviation from a circular shape, was higher for samples with the fibers running parallel to the <b>measurement</b> <b>surface.</b> Moreover, clear effects of wavelength and distance from the illumination point on this parameter were observed. These results show the importance of fiber orientation when considering optical techniques for measurements on anisotropic, fibrous tissues. Moreover, the prediction of muscle fiber orientation seemed feasible, which can be of interest to the meat industry. status: publishe...|$|E
