5|$|During the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress {{directed}} {{the organization of}} the <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> Virginia Rifle Regiment in resolves dated June 17 and 27, 1776. The unit comprised three of the four independent Continental rifle companies that had formed in <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> Virginia by decree of Congress in mid-1775, and six new companies—two from <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> four from Virginia. The three 1775 companies, among the first of the colonial units to join the newly constituted Continental Army, were raised and initially commanded by Capts. Michael Cresap, Thomas Price, and Hugh Stephenson. The nine-company force became a regiment on the same tables of organization as the 1st Continental Regiment, which was originally the Pennsylvania Rifle Regiment. Unlike this Pennsylvania unit, however, the <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> Virginia Rifle Regiment was an Extra Continental regiment because of its two-state composition. It was not part of a state line organization but was instead directly accountable to national authority (Congress and the Continental Army). The <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> Virginia Rifle Regiment's field officers were drawn from the original three 1775 companies based on their seniority. Hugh Stephenson from Virginia became the colonel, and Marylanders Moses Rawlings of Cresap's company and Otho Holland Williams of Price's company were designated the lieutenant colonel and major, respectively. All company officers were appointed in the summer of 1776, and subsequent recruiting for the unit in the two states extended {{to the end of the}} year. Recruiting occurred in Frederick and Harford Counties, <b>Maryland,</b> <b>and</b> Berkeley, Frederick, Loudoun, Fauquier, Prince William, and Culpeper Counties, Virginia. The enlisted men of the regiment served for three years or the duration of the war.|$|E

5|$|Soon after Lt. Col. Moses Rawlings, a Marylander, was {{exchanged}} from British captivity in late December 1777 or January 1778, the Board of War, at {{the request}} of the Maryland state government, assigned him command of the prisoner-of-war camp at Fort Frederick, <b>Maryland,</b> <b>and</b> its state militia guard. The elements of the <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> Virginia Rifle Regiment in the field continued to be led by the company commanders until recruiting could bring the regiment up to greater strength. Maj. Otho Holland Williams, exchanged on January 16, 1778 (likely with Rawlings), had been promoted to colonel of the 6th Maryland Regiment in December 1776 while a prisoner of war; he took command of this unit upon his release.
