In contrast, wild-type cultures showed a cell division arrest of about 10 h, followed by exponential growth. Supercoiled plasmid was regenerated at normal levels, and it readily transformed E. coli. These studies show that D. radiodurans retains a heterologous plasmid following irradiation and repairs it with the same high efficiency as its chromosomal DNA, while the repair defect in rec 30 prevents repair of the plasmid.

Model systems composed of 0. 1 - 10 % myoglobin, lactalbumin or BSA were used and the effects of propyl gallate, ascorbic acid, air or nitrogen, pH 5, 6 or 7 citrate or phosphate buffer, and addition of glucose and SDS were investigated. We found that 0. 02 - 0. 04 % propyl gallate (PG), alone or in conjunction with other solutes, inhibited protein aggregation after irradiation to 0. 5 and 1. 0 <b>megarad</b> and subsequent - 20 C storage for 3 - 6 months. PG alone at 0. 04 % yielded up to 90 % retention of myoglobin after 0. 5 <b>megarad</b> and up to 94 % retention of lactalbumin after 1. 0 <b>megarad</b> as compared to unirradiated controls. BSA appeared more radiation sensitive than other proteins, and use of 0. 02 % PG yielded retention of only 10 % of the original protein after 1. 0 <b>megarad.</b> Use of synergists such as glucose or SDS together with PG allowed up to a two-fold increase in protein retention, while use of 0. 02 % ascorbic acid led to lower retention compared to samples irradiated alone in control buffer. Irradiations at pH 5 and 6 yielded greater protein retention than at pH 7. Isoelectric focusing of myoglobin revealed acidic shifts in protein pI with new bands at pH 4. 9 - 5. 2 after irradiation at pH 6 with glucose and PG. A similar acidic shift was seen in focusing lactalbumin, with major new bands forming at pH 3. 7 - 4. 0 after irradiation in pH 6 phosphate with 0. 04 % PG. BSA showed a bipolar pattern of pI shifts after irradiation in pH 6 phosphate. Mice fed irradiated lactalbumin in factorial studies grew slightly faster and ate more than unirradiated controls, while those fed protein irradiated with 0. 02 % PG showed slightly decreased rates of gain and feed consumption. Amino acid analysis revealed a 35 % decrease in lysine, as compared to control, in diets prepared with protein irradiated to 1. 0 megarads in 0. 05 M phosphate, pH 6 with 0. 02 % PG. The negative effects of PG on feeding and growth were reduced when protein was irradiated at 22. 5 % rather than 15 % (w/v).

Survival curves, using gamma radiation as the sterilizing agent, were determined in raw beef with four strains of Micrococcus radiodurans.

The use of pulsed electron beams may provide the most cost-effective solution {{to the implementation of}} this technique. This paper presents the results of plasma chemistry calculations to study the effect of dose rate, pulse length and pulse repetition rate on pulsed electron beam processing of NO{sub x} and SO{sub 2 } in flue gases. The main objective is to determine if the proposed combinations of dose rate, pulse length and pulse repetition rate would have any deleterious effect on the utilization of radicals for pollutant removal. For a dose rate of 2 x 10 {sup 5 } <b>megarads</b> per second and a pulse length of 30 nanoseconds, the average dose per pulse is sufficiently low to prevent any deleterious effect on process efficiency because of radical-radical recombination reactions. During each post-pulse period, the radicals are utilized in the oxidation of NO{sub x} and SO{sub 2 } in a timescale of around 200 microseconds; thus, with pulse frequencies of around 5 kilohertz or less, the radical concentrations remain sufficiently low to prevent any significant competition between radical-pollutant and radical-radical reactions. The main conclusion is that a pulsed electron beam reactor, operating with a dose rate of 2 x 10 {sup 5 } <b>megarads</b> per second, pulse length of 30 ns and pulse repetition rate of up to around 5 kHz, will have the same plasma chemistry efficiency as an electron beam reactor operating with a very low dose rate in continuous mode...|$|R

Inhibition of influx of [3 H]cefadroxil into BBMV was used to determine the functional molecular {{mass of the}} transporter. Additionally, direct photoaffinity labeling of the transport-and/or binding proteins for [3 H]cefadroxil in control and irradiated BBMV was performed to determine the molecular mass of the putative transporter by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Initial rates of pH-gradient dependent uptake of [3 H]cefadroxil decreased progressively as a function of radiation dose. The apparent radiation inactivation size (RIS) of the transport function was found to be 414 ± 16 kDa. Direct photoaffinity labeling yielded labeled membrane proteins with apparent molecular masses of 130 kDa and 105 kDa, respectively. The proteins displayed different labeling characteristics with respect to incubation time, specificity and the response to irradiation. It appears that only a 105 kDa protein is directly involved in transport function since (a) only it showed a specific pH gradient dependent labeling pattern and (b) the covalent incorporation of [3 H]cefadroxil into this protein decreased parallel to the loss of transport function in irradiated BBMV.

40|$|Pulse-echo {{ultrahigh}} frequency ultrasonic measurements in gamma irradiated natural brazilian X-cut quartz crystals reveal {{the existence of}} Debye relaxation peaks at low (18 K) and high (155 and 255 K) temperatures which {{can be attributed to}} transitions of the hole trapped at the oxygen ion nearest to the substitutional aluminum impurities. The observed activation energies are in agreement with previous anelastic and dielectric loss measurements but the relaxation times are found to be respectively one to two, and five orders of magnitude smaller for the high and low temperatures peaks. The low-temperature peak shows an apparent radiation annealing for gamma doses in excess of one <b>megarad</b> attributed to the closing of tunnelling transitions of the hole from low-lying intermediate energy levels due to electrostatic shifts of the asymmetry of the double-well potential by ionized defects. Uncoupling of the sound waves to the split ground state levels of the hole {{may be due to the}} anisotropy of the deformation potential constant...|$|E
40|$|The {{attention}} of the present work {{is focused on the}} characterisation of thermoshrinking cross-linked polyethylene, which is produced at the <b>Megarad</b> s. r. l. ®rm and which is mostly used as insulation for electrical cables of low and medium voltage, protection for communication cables, anti-corrosion protection for gas pipes. Two cross-linking processes: chemical (silane grafting) and electron beam irradiation are employed. The performance of the end product is veri®ed by means of both destructive and non-destructive tests. Some parameters such as: gel fraction, modulus of elasticity at 1508 C and elongation percent are measured. Non-destructive tests are carried out by means of lock-in thermography; the variation of the phase angle with increasing the cross-linking degree is related to the variation of the modulus of elasticity. It is found that the thermographic technique is capable of giving information about material modifications arising under cross-linking and is also able to detect defects which may form during manufacturing...|$|E
40|$|The present {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the production of cross-linked low-density polyethylene. The aim is to gain information about costs/benefits of two cross-linking methods, which are the chemical through silane grafting and the electron-beam irradiation. These two methods were used at the <b>Megarad</b> firm (Italy) for cross-linking of low-density polyethylene, which was mainly used for electric cable insulation. The two cross-linking processes were examined by evaluating the performance of the end product and the production costs. The performance of the final product was assessed through experimental tests, which consisted in the evaluation of some peculiar properties of the material such as gel fraction, thermal modifications under heat fluxes, modulus of elasticity at 150 °C, elongation parameters. Costs were analyzed by considering both direct and indirect costs. It seems that, notwithstanding the elevated costs of installation, the electron-beam irradiation method is preferable because it allows for a product of superior characteristics with the lowest production costs...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The over-tenderization of irradiated-sterilized meat {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{important}} adverse effects resulting from the use of irradiation for the preservation of meat. Although research has been reported on the activity and effect of the inherent proteolytic enzymes of irradiated meat, very little work has been directed toward the intimate causes of the textural problems induced by the irradiation treatment. In this study, the influence of irradiation-sterilization on some of the muscle characteristics involved in meat texture was investigated in an attempt to elucidate the over-tenderizing action of irradiation. In addition, the influence of treating the meat by several means prior to irradiation was also investigated to determine their effects upon the texture of the meat. Information relative to the above objectives was obtained by using analytical methods designed to show changes in muscle protein charges, water-holding capacity, acidic and basic groups, bound and free minerals, and disc electrophoretic analysis of the glycine soluble extracts of the treated and control samples. The results showed that the irradiation-sterilization of beef muscle at 4. 5 <b>megarads</b> caused tenderization of the meat. Beef soaked in an equal amount of distilled water for 72 hours at 38 °F prior to heat inactivation of the enzymes and irradiation was much firmer in texture than the unsoaked samples. Beef heated to an internal temperature of 160 °F prior to irradiation also resulted in meat having a firm texture. However, irradiation tends to reverse the effects of both soaking and heating and/or the combination of these two treatments. When soaking, heating and irradiation are combined in one treatment, these factors tend to exert their effect individually and by different mechanisms. Soaking the meat appears to cause a partial denaturation and a net loss of anions of some of the muscle proteins resulting in a shift in the isoelectric region of such meat to a higher pH which results in a greater loss of water upon cooking and thus a firmer texture. Heating the meat to an internal temperature of 160 °F results in a partial denaturation of the proteins and probably leads to the formation of stable cross linkages and a "salting-out" effect which may be responsible for a decrease in the water-holding capacity. Thus, meat would have a tighter or more "closed" structure and firmer texture. Irradiation exerts a fragmentation effect upon the beef muscle proteins. These fragments seem to be held together by hydrogen bonds and/or electrostatic forces. The fragmentary alterations of the muscle proteins, the incorporation of water within the fragments, and possibly a "salting-in" effect, appear to be the major factors responsible for effects of irradiation on beef muscle texture. The zinc cations appear to be involved with the heat-labile proteins or enzymes which are denaturated by heating to 160 °F. The pH-water holding capacity curves were found to be a valuable technique for investigating some of the biochemical changes in the muscle proteins...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 A {{method was}} devised and tested for rapid and {{quantitative}} identification of microbial flora in fresh seafoods. The rapid identification {{of large numbers}} of isolates was made possible by (1) a simplified identification scheme established by reference culture studies and from the known reactions of microorganisms reported in the literature, (2) the multiple transfer {{of large numbers of}} isolates by means of replica-plating, and (3) the use of an electronic computer to analyze data. For the identification of microbial isolates, colonies developing on initial isolation plates were picked by sterile toothpicks and inoculated on a master-plate in prearranged spacing and order. Growth on the master-plate was replicated on a series of solid agar plates containing differential or selective agents. Identifying characteristics consisted of growth responses of the isolates on media containing penicillin, tylosin, vancomycin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, neomycin and colistin; growth responses on Bacto-SS, Bacto-S- 110, Bacto-potato dextrose agar; and culture pigmentation, cell morphology and the Gram-reaction. Information was processed by an IBM 1410 digital computer which sorted and grouped each isolate into one of ten microbial genera or groups, according to a programmed identification key. The identification system was tested by analyzing the microbial flora of dover sole fillets (Microstomas pacificus) and ground beef. This rapid identification method was employed in an investigation designed to determine the nature of the microbial flora shifts in dover sole resulting from irradiation and storage at 6 °C. The relationship between the microorganisms which initially survive irradiation, and those making up the final spoilage flora, was determined. A total of 2, 723 isolates were examined in this study. The spoilage of unirradiated control samples during storage at 6 °C was almost entirely due to the growth of Pseudomonas. This group, which occupied 25 percent of the fresh flora, grew up to nearly 100 percent in two days storage. In contrast, irradiation doses of 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3, and 0. 4 <b>megarad</b> favored the growth of Achromobacter and yeasts. Micrococcus species, which survived radiation, did not grow at 6 °C. At 0. 5 <b>megarad,</b> spoilage of fish samples at 6 °C was due entirely to yeasts...|$|E
40|$|A chip is {{described}} that will perform lossless compression and decompression using the Rice Algorithm. The chip set {{is designed to}} compress and decompress source data in real time for many applications. The encoder is designed to code at 20 M samples/second at MIL specifications. That corresponds to 280 Mbits/second at maximum quantization or approximately 500 Mbits/second under nominal conditions. The decoder is designed to decode at 10 M samples/second at industrial specifications. A wide range of quantization levels is allowed (4 [...] . 14 bits) and both nearest neighbor prediction and external prediction are supported. When the pre and post processors are bypassed, the chip set performs high speed entropy coding and decoding. This frees the chip set from being tied to one modeling technique or specific application. Both the encoder and decoder are being fabricated in a 1. 0 micron CMOS process that has been tested to survive 1 <b>megarad</b> of total radiation dosage. The CMOS chips are small, only 5 mm on a side, and both are estimated to consume less than 1 / 4 of a Watt of power while operating at maximum frequency...|$|E
