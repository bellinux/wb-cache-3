40|$|During {{the second}} half of the twentieth century family {{structures}} have changed significantly in western countries: individuals marry later in their lives once they have achieved a certain level of education and of professional stability, the level of education among men and women has come significantly closer, women’s participation in the labor market has significantly increased, families are increasingly supported by two incomes in the household, marriage rates have dropped, new family models have appeared and divorce rates have increased. These social changes have modified family roles and the position and function of each spouse within the marriage. At the same time and directly related to the new family structures, family property, its composition and title have also experienced important modifications. Despite of this remarkable evolution in family structures and family property, family law of most western countries does not reflect the new reality when regulating <b>marital</b> <b>crises,</b> particularly regarding dissolutions of the marital economic regimes.

40|$|A {{goal of this}} {{bachelor}} thesis {{with the}} topic "Specifics of the social work with families in divorce is to compare a prior-to divorce, divorce, anti-divorce care in towns of České Budějovice and Prostějov and to search for state and private institutions dealing with problems of families in divorce in those localities. The thesis {{has been focused on}} the quality and availability of these services and on used methods of work with families in divorce proceedings. A partial goal of the thesis is also to ascertain views of addressed experts on an importance and quality of the family mediation in the Czech Republic. The theoretical part of the bachelor thesis deals with the divorce issues. At the beginning the thesis focuses its attention on statistical data, defines the divorce and its causes, a course of divorce process, deals with an adjustment of relations for minor children after the divorce. A substantial part of the theory deals with a process of the social work with families in divorce. In that part there are described theories and methods of the social work with families in divorce, social services for families in divorce in the Czech Republic, there is described a role of the social and legal protection of children and a method of family mediation. The final part briefly introduces the issue of the parental alienation syndrome. A goal of the research part of the bachelor thesis was to compare an area of a prior-to-divorce, divorce and after-divorce care in regions of České Budějovice and Prostějov and to search for state and private institutions dealing with issues of the family in divorce in those regions. One of the goals was also to find out at what stage of the divorce these institutions attend to the families and which way they intervene in the situation. It was used a technique of half-standardized interview for the research. The research target group consisted of workers from institutions, whose focus of the professional interest is the family and children in the towns of České Budějovice and Prostějov. More detailed interviews were conducted in organizations, specialized in working with families in divorce. A result of the research shows {{that it is necessary to}} increase a number of workers attending to families in divorce, because numbers of divorced families are still growing. Due to an increase of the workforce, a quality of the offered service which is according to observed results rather good, could be improved. It was found out that the cooperation between state and private organizations works at a good level, individual institutions have information about activities of other workplaces and so they can refer clients to a professional help. Most organizations, where was the research conducted, have an aim to protect interests of the child. The most important thing for the staff of these organizations seems to be the least impair of the child´s development. They can see a roll of a mediator in divorce issue as a positive one, but they highlight the shortage of qualified mediators. To the topic of the parental alienation syndrome the workers say, that they meet it at their work. Recently manifestations of this syndrome have had more and more publicity, which fact workers do not evaluate very positively. As a result of this promotion there is increasing a number of cases, when parents feel a condemnation, even if it is not true in many cases. In practice the bachelor thesis can serve as an overview of services for families in divorce in České Budějovice and Prostějov. It can also establish priorities in the area of the divorce care and it can offer effective social measures in institutions dealing with family issues, family relationships, <b>marital</b> and family <b>crises.</b> The results can also become a basis for other studies and researches in that area...|$|R

50|$|Another of Corlett's novels, Bloxworth Blue (1984), {{named after}} a species of rare butterfly, explores many of Corlett's usual themes through five related strands of story.

Guilt, death, love, betrayal, murder, pain, lust, youth, old age, time and god: Bloxworth Blue is a strong mixture.|$|E

She and Burton starred as Martha and George, a middle-aged couple {{going through a}} <b>marital</b> <b>crisis.</b> To convincingly play 50-year-old Martha, Taylor gained weight, wore a wig, and used make-up to make herself look old and tired—in stark contrast to her public image as a glamorous film star. At Taylor's suggestion, theater director Mike Nichols was hired to direct the project, despite his lack of experience with film. The production differed from anything she had done previously, as Nichols wanted to thoroughly rehearse the play before beginning filming. Woolf was considered groundbreaking for its adult themes and uncensored language, and opened to [...] "glorious" [...] reviews.
