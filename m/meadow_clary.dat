5000|$|June: <b>Meadow</b> <b>Clary,</b> Hairy Mallow, Ground Pine, common {{milkwort}} ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Meadow</b> <b>Clary</b> {{blooms in}} June and July, its flowers being a {{brilliant}} blue. The site also support {{a variety of}} typical limestone grassland plants which include Common Rock-rose, Cowslip, Lady's Bedstraw, Common Restharrow, Dwarf Thistle, Burnet-saxifrage, Field Scabious, Quaking-grass and Green-winged Orchids.|$|E
50|$|The {{conservation}} is centred on promoting {{the spread of}} <b>Meadow</b> <b>Clary,</b> but maintaining and developing the overall wildlife interest. Cattle grazing is used to prevent the growth of coarse grass and restricts scrub. Thistles are cut annually and any ragwort growth is pulled.|$|E
50|$|Salvia pratensis (<b>meadow</b> <b>clary</b> or meadow sage) is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the family Lamiaceae, native to Europe, western Asia and northern Africa. The specific epithet pratensis refers to its tendency to grow in meadows. It also grows in scrub edges and woodland borders.|$|E
5000|$|The reserve {{consists}} of two meadows and supports {{one of the largest}} United Kingdom populations of the rare <b>Meadow</b> <b>Clary.</b> It is on Inferior Oolitic limestone and Fuller's Earth and faces south. It overlies extensive mine workings. These produced high quality freestone used for building in the Stroud area.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} a source for flower {{collectors}} for centuries. Nationally Rare species, Hairy Mallow and <b>Meadow</b> <b>Clary,</b> were both collected from Ranscombe Farm, in 1699 and 1792 respectively. Other rarities include Ground Pine and Broad-leaved Cudweed and at least six species of orchid including Fly, Lady ('Fair Maidens of Kent') and Man Orchid.|$|E
50|$|Small {{areas of}} chalk-heath {{vegetation}} occur on superficial clay-with-flints deposits. Here chalk-loving {{plants such as}} salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor) and dropwort co-exist with plants typical of acid soils, including gorse (Ulex europaeus), heather (Calluna vulgaris) and the uncommon annual knawel (Scleranthus annuus). Two Red Data Book (RDB) plants occur on the plain. The largest population in Britain of tuberous thistle (Cirsium tuberosum) occurs on the western ranges and is notable for the low incidence of hybridisation with dwarf thistle, a contributory cause of its decline in other localities. <b>Meadow</b> <b>clary</b> (Salvia pratensis) persists as a small colony in tall upright brome grassland.|$|E
50|$|On {{the steep}} {{northern}} {{slopes of the}} Burgberg lies the Frauenschuhfl√§che ("Lady's Slipper Field"), {{a relic of the}} time when the slopes of the Burgberg were used to graze sheep and goats. The grazing of animals {{led to the creation of}} many areas of semi-dry grassland on which a specialised flora developed. These grasslands, with just a few sparse trees and juniper bushes, became favourite habitats for the Lady's slipper orchid, hence the field's name, as well as the fringed gentian, <b>meadow</b> <b>clary</b> and wild majoram. It has been placed under nature conservation and is accessible via a footpath. An information board describes how it was formed and the vegetation of the area.|$|E
50|$|The site {{supports}} {{a range of}} habitats which include unimproved calcareous grassland, woodland and scrub, cliff faces and scree slopes. The grassland is of major importance and it comprises a tall ungrazed sward. This is dominated by tor-grass, upright brome, meadow oat-grass, sweet vernal-grass and quaking grass. It is noted for its range of herbs which include salad burnet, common rock-rose, common bird's-foot-trefoil. The quarry floors support wild thyme, dwarf thistle, yellow-wort and autumn gentian. The site supports many plants which are scarce at a national or county level. These include fly orchid, musk orchid and purple milk-vetch. It {{is one of a}} small number of sites which support <b>meadow</b> <b>clary</b> in the county.|$|E
