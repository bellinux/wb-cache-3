40|$|A {{modulator}} circuit board {{has recently been}} developed {{to be used in}} conjunction with a vector modulator to generate any {{of a large number of}} modulations for bandwidth-efficient radio transmission of digital data signals at rates than can exceed 100 Mb/s. The modulations include quadrature phaseshift keying (QPSK), offset quadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK), Gaussian minimum-shift keying (GMSK), and octonary phase-shift keying (8 PSK) with square-root raised-cosine pulse shaping. The figure is a greatly simplified block diagram showing the relationship between the <b>modulator</b> <b>board</b> and the rest of the transmitter. The role of the <b>modulator</b> <b>board</b> is to encode the incoming data stream and to shape the resulting pulses, which are fed as inputs to the vector modulator. The combination of encoding and pulse shaping in a given application is chosen to maximize the bandwidth efficiency. The <b>modulator</b> <b>board</b> includes gallium arsenide serial-to-parallel converters at its input end. A complementary metal oxide/semiconductor (CMOS) field-programmable gate array (FPGA) performs the coding and modulation computations and utilizes parallel processing in doing so. The results of the parallel computation are combined and converted to pulse waveforms by use of gallium arsenide parallel-to-serial converters integrated with digital-to-analog converters. Without changing the hardware, one can configure the modulator to produce any of the designed combinations of coding and modulation by loading the appropriate bit configuration file into the FPGA...|$|E
40|$|Gigabit-per-second {{communications}} {{have been}} a desired target for future NASA Earth science missions, and for potential manned lunar missions. Frequency bandwidth at S-band and X-band is typically insufficient to support missions at these high data rates. In this paper, we present {{the results of a}} 1 Gbps 32 -QAM end-to-end experiment at Ka-band using a reconfigurable Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) baseband <b>modulator</b> <b>board.</b> Bit error rate measurements of the received signal using a software receiver demonstrate the feasibility of using ultra-high data rates at Ka-band, although results indicate that error correcting coding and/or modulator predistortion must be implemented in addition. Also, results of the demonstration validate the low-cost, MOS-based reconfigurable modulator approach taken to development of a high rate modulator, as opposed to more expensive ASIC or pure analog approaches...|$|E

The changes in war fighting tactics and advancement of technology shape {{the ways to}} implement and design multifunction phased array radars. This thesis investigated whether the commercial modulation boards used in the 3 -D 2. 4 - GHz phased array transmit antenna is capable of wideband performance. The phase of the transmitted signal out of the <b>modulator</b> <b>board</b> was adjusted to provide a phase shift from 0 to 2,รยง and the insertion phases at these phase settings were measured using a Vector Network Analyzer, sweeping the frequency from 0. 8 to 2. 5 GHz. The measured insertion phases are used to simulate the radiation pattern of a linear phased array, and {{the results show that}} modulator does not have instantaneous wideband characteristics. This thesis also looked at the design of the complementary phased array receiver architecture using commercially available demodulator boards. The demodulator board was successfully configured to operate as a phase shifter. Phase shifted transmit signals were injected into the demodulator, and corresponding phase shifts were measured via the In-Phase and Quadrature voltages.

40|$|The {{accelerating}} {{increase in}} information traffic demands {{the expansion of}} optical access network systems that require cost reduction of optical and photonic components. Low cost, ease of fabrication, and integration capabilities of low optical-loss polymers make them attractive for photonic applications. In addition to passive wave-guiding components, electro-optic (EO) polymers consisting of a polymeric matrix doped with organic nonlinear chromophores have enabled wide-RF-bandwidth and low-power optical <b>modulators.</b> Beside <b>board</b> level passive and active optical components, compact on-chip modulators (a few 100 micronmeters to a few millimeters) have been made possible by hybrid integration of EO polymers onto the silicon platform. This paper summarizes {{some of the recent}} progress in polymer based optical modulators and interconnects. A highly linear, broadband directional coupler modulator for use in analog optical links and compact, and low-power silicon/polymer hybrid slot photonic crystal waveguide modulators for on chip applications are presented. Recently, cost-effective roll-to-roll fabrication of electronic and photonic systems on flexible substrates has been gaining interest. A low-cost imprinted/ink-jet-printed Mach-Zehnder modulator and board-to-board optical interconnects using microlens integrated 45 -degree mirror couplers compatible with the roll-to-roll fabrication platforms are also presented.

40|$|The {{concept of}} a {{wirelessly}} networked opportunistic digital phased array radar brings about the added advantages of stealth, enhanced survivability, and maximum maneuverablity. The array elements are spread {{over a wide range}} of locations on the ship's hull and superstructure, and the Local Oscillator (LO) and data/control signals are wirelessly transmitted to and from a central computer processor, which also performs as the digital beamformer. As part of the ongoing research effort, this thesis focused on the hardware and software development of a 2. 4 GHz two-element array demonstrator. A system analysis of a generic distributed array radar was done and some key parameters pertaining to the Transmit/Recieve (T/R) module and an eight-element array radar were calculated. In addition, the research analyzed the radar waveform properties, sampling and data rates, the digital beamformer concept and requirements, and assessed their impacts on the radar performoance. Two Transmit/Recieve (T/R) modules were built and a two-element array test bench developed using the various National Instruments Compact Reconfigurable Input and Output (cRIO) and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) modules. The main software, written in LabVIEW, allowed the test bench to demonstrate proper functionalities of transmission and reception of the T/R modules. The hardware and software code could be extended easily for an eight-element array radar. Lastly, a number of measurements to characterize the T/R module were done. No significant interference between the <b>modulator</b> and demodulator <b>boards</b> inside of the compact T/R module chassis were observed...|$|R
