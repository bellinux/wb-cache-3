40|$|THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANEMIA AND IRON STATUS WITH IMMUNE STATUS OF CHILDREN VACCINATED WITH MEASLES VACCINE. Background: Anemia, {{especially}} {{caused by}} iron deficiency, {{is one of}} several health problems in Indonesian children below 5 years of age. That condition seems appear in young children whose food is lack of iron. When those children are going to be vaccinated, how will the result be?. Objective: We sought to determine the relationship between anemia and iron with immune status of children who have got measles vaccine. Method: The study was conducted in village of Bantarjaya district of Bogor, from June 1997 to February 1998 in 86 children above 9 months old who received measles vaccines in local Post Integrated Service (Posyandu). Before intervention, data on physical examination, weight, height, hemoglobin, hematocrit serum ferritin, free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) and <b>measle</b> immunoglobin G were obtained from all Subjects. Information on morbidity, socioeconomic, environment and food consumption also were recorded. After intervention or six mouths later, the same data were collected again. Results: Subjects were divided into two group; (1) anemic group (Hb 11 g/dl) with 40 subjects (45, 5 %). The study revealed that 27, 9 % subjects have iron deficiency and 43, 0 % suffered from iron deficiency anemia. Six months after vaccination, the level of measles IgG was increased in 87, 4 % subjects. The <b>measle</b> IgG level of the non anemic group was increased significantly, but was not significant for the anemic group. Conclusions: There were no relationship between iron status and immune status but however anemic condition influenced the level of measles IgG.

40|$|Background. The Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) is {{the most}} {{cost-effective}} measures to control vaccine-preventable diseases. Currently, the EPI schedule is similar for HIV-infected children; the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) should considerably prolong their life expectancy. Methods and Principal Findings. To evaluate the persistence of antibodies to the EPI vaccines in HIV-infected and HIV-exposed uninfected children who previously received these vaccines in routine clinical practice, we conducted a cross-sectional study of children, aged 18 to 36 months, born to HIV-infected mothers and living in Central Africa. We tested blood samples for antibodies to the combined diphtheria, tetanus, and whole-cell pertussis (DTwP), the measles and the oral polio (OPV) vaccines. We enrolled 51 HIV-infected children of whom 33 were receiving ART, and 78 HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-infected women.

40|$|Central {{nervous system}} (CNS) {{complications}} occuring {{early and late}} after acute measles are serious and often fatal. In spite of functional cell-mediated immunity and high antiviral antibody titers, an immunological control of the CNS infection is not achieved in patients suffering from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). The known cellular receptors for <b>measle</b> virus (MV) in humans, CD 46 and CD 150 (signaling lymphocyte activation molecule, SLAM), are important components of the viral tropism by mediating binding and entry to peripheral cells. Because neural cells do not express SLAM and only sporadically CD 46, virus entry to neural cells, and spread within the CNS, remain mechanistically unclear.

40|$|The Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey (SDKI) {{was carried}} out in 1994. To {{maximize}} the usefulness and evaluate the relevance of the data that had been collected, extended analysis of immunizational status and morbidity of children underthree was performed. The purpose of this analysis was to assess the cases and proportion of the diseases or symptoms of children underthree who could show the KMS or Immunization card based on the status of immunization, to compare the proportion of the diseases or symptoms between the immunizational status groups, and to assess the Odds Ratio (OR) of disease in the uncompleted and non-immunized groups compared to the completed immunized group. A bivariate analysis in SPSS programme using x 2 and OR tests was used. The overall diseases proportion of the 1959 children underthree who could show KMS or Immunization card was 51. 3 %. The highest percentage of cases (47. 7 %) was cough with fast breathing (pneumonia) in the uncompleted immunization group (missed {{one or more of these}} immunization: BCG, DPT, Polio and <b>Measle),</b> and the highest disease proportion (26. 3 %) was fever with cough (non pneumonia ARI) in non-immunized group. The highest disease proportion in completed immunized children underthree was fever with cough (non pneumonia ARI); while in the uncompleted immunized group it was fever with cough with or without fast breathing (non pneumonia ARI or pneumonia); and in non-immunized group were fever with cough with or without fast breathing or with diarrhoea (non pneumonia ARI or pneumonia or with diarrhoea). The uncompleted immunized DPT group had 1. 57 - 4. 25 higher risk of non pneumonia ARI or pneumonia with or without diarrhoea than the completed immunized DPT group.
