He also received two penalty points to his licence. Carlos Sainz received a reprimand from the stewards for leaving the pit lane one <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> it was allowed. He escaped a more severe penalty because he stopped shortly afterwards, thereby not gaining an advantage. Upon his return to Toro Rosso, Daniil Kvyat recorded the first fastest lap of his career, and the first for the Italian team in their 190th Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|The most noted of Bauer's {{pictures}} are his watercolors, the technique he used when illustrating for books and magazines; he alternated between aquarelle and gouache.

These water-soluble, and fast drying, media allowed Bauer to work on his pictures until the last <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> deadline, something he was prone to do.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAcute lung {{injury is}} an {{inflammatory}} syndrome {{that increases the}} permeability of the blood-gas barrier, resulting in high morbidity and mortality. Despite intensive research, treatment options remain limited. We investigated the protective efficacy of tezosentan, a novel, dual endothelin receptor antagonist, in an experimental model of alpha-naphthylthiourea (ANTU) -induced acute lung injury in rats. ANTU was intraperitoneally (i. p.) injected into rats at a dose of 10  mg/kg. Tezosentan was injected 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> ANTU was subcutaneously (s. c.) injected at doses of 2, 10, or 30  mg/kg, 60 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> ANTU was injected at doses of 2, 10, or 30  mg/kg (i. p.), and 90 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> ANTU at a dose of 10  mg/kg (i. p.). Four hours later, the lung weight/body weight (LW/BW) ratio and pleural effusion (PE) were measured. When injected 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> ANTU at doses of 2, 10, or 30  mg/kg (s. c.), tezosentan {{had no effect on}} lung pathology. When injected 60 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> ANTU at doses of 2, 10, or 30  mg/kg (i. p.) or 90 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> ANTU (10  mg/kg, i. p.), tezosentan significantly decreased the PE/BW ratio and had a prophylactic effect on PE formation at all doses. Therefore, tezosentan may attenuate lung injury. Furthermore, its acute and inhibitory effects on fluid accumulation were more effective in the pleural cavity than in the interstitial compartment in this experimental model...|$|R

There were a large number of attacks from both sides, but it took until the 77th <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> Cardiff {{equalised}} with a header by Hughie Ferguson after a series of passing plays.

40|$|ObjectivesGuidelines {{recommend}} {{antibiotic prophylaxis}} 60 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> skin incision; however, {{it is unclear}} whether more precise timing would further reduce sternal wound infection. Our objectives were {{to examine the relationship between}} antibiotic timing and infection, test potential efficacy of optimal antibiotic timing in preventing infection, and determine whether patient comorbidity is related to timing and infection. MethodsFrom 1 / 1 / 1995 – 1 / 1 / 2008, 28, 250 patients underwent 28, 702 cardiac surgical procedures involving a median sternotomy; 85 % received only cefuroxime and 15 % received only vancomycin prophylaxis. Multivariable analysis identified factors associated with infection within each phase, and risk-adjusted optimal timing was determined using patient data, risk variables, and hypothetical values of antibiotic timing. ResultsPrevalence of sternal wound infection was 2. 0 % (489 patients) for cefuroxime and 2. 3 % (101 patients) for vancomycin. Minimum prevalence for infection was 1. 8 % observed when cefuroxime was administered 15 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> incision; risk increased to 2. 2 % with administration more than 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> incision and to 2. 8 % at 60 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> incision. Minimum prevalence of infection in patients who received vancomycin was 1. 8 % observed with initiation 32 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> incision; risk increased to 2. 2 % for administration 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> incision and 3. 2 % with administration 60 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> incision. Simulation for optimal timing found that it was influenced by phase-specific risk factors. ConclusionsRefining current antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines may lower sternal wound infections. Antibiotic administration timing resulting in lowest likelihood for infection varied with antibiotic and patient-specific factors. Optimal risk-adjusted timing could potentially reduce infections by 9 %- 31 %...|$|R

5|$|On {{the same}} lap Irvine overtook his {{teammate}} Herbert for tenth position. Wurz {{crashed into the}} barriers at turn 1 {{and was forced to}} retire. Gené retired on lap 22 with a gearbox issue as his teammate Mazzacane subsequently collided with the barriers at turn one on the same lap and had to retire from the event. Herbert became the first driver to make a pit stop on lap 27 although his pit crew came unprepared and Herbert was stationary for half a <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> he exited in 17th position. On the 31st lap, Diniz made contact with the barriers at turn one and he damaged his left rear wheel, causing him to retire. Häkkinen's pace was reduced by lap 36 as he slowed with an blockage on his brake pedal and made an unscheduled pit stop. His team's mechanics opened his car's inspection hatch and rearranged radio cables. They subsequently removed a data transmitter which was the cause the blockage and Häkkinen rejoined in 9th. Trulli became the next retirement of the race when he pulled {{to the side of the}} track with a gearbox problem on the following lap.|$|E
5|$|St Johnstone {{entered the}} north/east {{section of the}} first round draw and were paired with Second Division club Raith Rovers away from home at Stark's Park.
