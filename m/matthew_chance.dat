2500|$|Very {{early in}} the morning, CNN {{reporter}} <b>Matthew</b> <b>Chance</b> {{reported that he had}} seen and spoken to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi in a convoy of armoured Land Cruisers near the Rixos Al Nasr hotel. Al Arabiya reported via Le Figaro that a rebel confirmed that Saif had been captured, but then escaped. The rebels later confirmed that Saif had been in their custody, but escaped in the chaos of the situation. Saif claimed the people of Libya were behind him and his father, that NATO had jammed loyalist communications, including state TV and that [...] "gangs of saboteurs" [...] had been smuggled into Tripoli via civilians cars and boats. Saif was seen amongst Gaddafi supporters handing out weapons to them outside the Bab al-Azizia compound and being organised in [...] "street brigades" [...] to fight the rebels.|$|E

50|$|At {{the start}} of the 2003-04 season he was used almost {{exclusively}} as a substitute. In mid-December he joined Third Division Darlington on a one-month loan. He played six games, scoring one goal. Upon returning to Bristol he went straight into the first team - though this was at Rovers rather than City. Wilson claimed this was to give <b>Matthews</b> a <b>chance</b> at regular football. Appreciated at The Memorial Stadium, Matthews considered making the move permanent. Caretaker-manager Phil Bater was keen to oblige, however the loan deal ended in March, Matthews having failed to score in nine games. He moved straight on to Yeovil Town, in a loan deal later extended {{to the end of the}} season. In June 2004 he was released by City, though manager Wilson soon followed him out the door.|$|R
5000|$|Fauntroy visited Libya on a [...] "peace mission" [...] {{during the}} 2011 Libyan civil war. [...] He {{remained}} there through {{the invasion of}} Tripoli, amongst the journalists holed up at the Rixos Al Nasr, where all Western media was based; this fact was confirmed by CNN reporter <b>Matthew</b> <b>Chance</b> on August 23, 2011, who noted on Twitter that Fauntroy was among the journalists being held within the hotel. He was released {{with the rest of}} the foreign nationals on August 25, 2011, and returned to Washington, where he took part in remembrances of the anniversary of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s [...] "I Have a Dream" [...] speech.|$|E

50|$|Supporters of Marcan posteriority advance {{these as}} clear cases of Mark conflating the {{parallel}} accounts from Matthew and Luke. Supporters of Marcan priority, {{on the other}} hand, point to {{a larger number of}} instances where both Matthew and Luke have chosen the same half of a Marcan dualism and argue that, when each gospel trimmed down these redundant expressions, sometimes by <b>chance</b> <b>Matthew</b> and Luke made opposite choices. It is hard to judge, though, as the choice can seldom be seen as an arbitrary one.|$|R
50|$|Bandiera {{once again}} took maximum {{points at the}} second {{intermediate}} sprint but the break was caught with 21 kilometers left. Tinkoff-Saxo, once again, kept station at the front to protect Contador from any danger. Several sprinters fell off the back once the peloton reached the final stretch of the stage. Yesterday's stage winner, André Greipel, tried {{to stay with the}} peloton but he also fell off the back. Michael <b>Matthews</b> sacrificed his <b>chances</b> for Simon Gerrans but they were not well-placed for the sprint. Eventually, it was Diego Ulissi who came to the front. No one was able to match his speed as he won his first stage since his nine-month suspension. Contador and the other GC favourites finished safely within the peloton and as a result, Contador kept the maglia rosa.|$|R
5000|$|Songwriter David John Matthews, {{working in}} Charlottesville, Virginia, as a {{bartender}} at Miller's bar in November 1990, became {{a friend of}} a lawyer named Ross Hoffman. Hoffman convinced the usually reserved Matthews to record a demo of the few songs he had written. Hoffman hoped Matthews could shop the songs in order to find other musicians to perform on some studio work with him. Hoffman encouraged Matthews to approach Carter Beauford, a local drummer on the Charlottesville music scene. Beauford had been in several bands and was then playing on a jazz show on BET. After hearing Matthews' demo, Carter agreed to spend some time playing the drums, {{both inside and outside the}} studio. Matthews also approached LeRoi Moore, another local jazz musician who often performed with the John D'earth Quintet, to join them. Moore skeptically listened to the demo, but liked what he heard and decided that he too would give <b>Matthews</b> a <b>chance.</b> The trio began working on Matthews' songs in 1991. Matthews recollects that, [...] "...the reason I went to Carter was not because I needed a drummer, but because I thought he was the baddest thing I'd ever seen and LeRoi, it wasn't because I desperately wanted a saxophone, it was because this guy just blew my mind. At this jazz place I used to bartend at Miller's, I would just sit back and watch him. I would be serving the musicians fat whiskeys and they'd be getting more and more hosed, but no matter how much, he used to still blow my mind. And it was the sense that everyone played from their heart. And when we got together and they asked, 'What do you want the music to sound like?' I said, 'I know this is a song I wrote and I like what you guys play, so I want you to play the way you react to my song.' There was a lot of breaking of our inhibitions." ...|$|R
