25|$|Socrates gets Hippias {{to agree}} that the more a man knows about a subject, the better {{position}} he will be in to lie about it.

Socrates never indicates what a man might stand to gain from lying about such matters, but brings the conversation back around to Achilles, and what kind of man Homer intended to portray.|$|E
500|$|Njai Dasima ( [...] ; Perfected Spelling: Nyai Dasima) is a 1932 {{film from}} the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) which was {{directed}} by Bachtiar Effendi for Tan's Film. It was the second film adapted from G. Francis' 1896 novel Tjerita Njai Dasima, following a silent version in 1929. Starring Momo and Oesman, it followed a young Sundanese njai (concubine) who is tricked into marrying a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not love her and ultimately killed for her money. The film, the first talkie produced by its company, {{was also the first}} directed by a native Indonesian. The now-lost work received mixed critical reception.|$|E

When one thinks about whether the barber should shave himself or not, the paradox begins to emerge.|$|R

500|$|In {{terms of}} storyline and characters, RPGamer welcomed the characters' depth, and the {{emphasis}} placed into the personalities and development of supporting characters, asserting that previous Castlevania games ignored {{the development of the}} supporting characters in exchange for concentrating on the protagonist. IGN called the game's ending [...] "incredibly unfulfilling and disappointing," [...] but lauded the change from the conventional plot of a Castlevania game, in which a member of the Belmont clan defeats Dracula {{with the aid of a}} host of supporting characters. GameSpy criticized the presence of a [...] "weak female who needs protection" [...] and an [...] "effeminate-looking <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> all the slaying" [...] as stereotypical Castlevania elements, but noted that the [...] "powerful and compelling scenario" [...] the game had was the best in the series since Symphony of the Night.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1559, it became evident that Elizabeth {{was in love with}} her {{childhood}} friend Robert Dudley. It was said that Amy Robsart, his wife, was suffering from a [...] "malady in one of her breasts" [...] and that the Queen would like to marry Dudley if his wife should die. By the autumn of 1559, several foreign suitors were vying for Elizabeth's hand; their impatient envoys engaged in ever more scandalous talk and reported that a marriage with her favourite was not welcome in England: [...] "There is not a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not cry out on him and her with indignation... she will marry none but the favoured Robert". Amy Dudley died in September 1560, from a fall from a flight of stairs and, despite the coroner's inquest finding of accident, many people suspected Dudley of having arranged her death so that he could marry the queen. Elizabeth seriously considered marrying Dudley for some time. However, William Cecil, Nicholas Throckmorton, and some conservative peers made their disapproval unmistakably clear. There were even rumours that the nobility would rise if the marriage took place.|$|E
500|$|Soma's {{character}} has received praise and criticism from several video game publications. GameSpy noted that although Soma {{fell into the}} stereotypical role of [...] "an effeminate-looking <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> all the slaying", the original scenario that Aria of Sorrow presented provided a better context for his character. The fact that Soma was {{not a member of}} the Belmont clan, the protagonists of most Castlevania games, was lauded by IGN and RPGamer, with the latter commenting on how it contributed to the [...] "depth" [...] of the storyline. The manner in which Soma's [...] "power of dominance" [...] translated into the [...] system featured in both games was widely acclaimed; IGN commented that it contributed [...] "significantly" [...] to the overall feel of Aria of Sorrow, and RPGamer celebrated the [...] "triumphant return" [...] of the Tactical Soul system in Dawn of Sorrow. Reviewers also complimented Soma's graphical representation. GameSpy noted the [...] "good animation on easily viewable sprites" [...] in Aria of Sorrow, and GameSpot called the graphics in Dawn of Sorrow [...] "intricate and gorgeous", making note of the character sprites. The change to an anime design in Dawn of Sorrow was criticized. GameSpy deplored the [...] "shallow, lifeless anime images" [...] used for Soma's in-game representation, and Kojima's absence from the production. IGN claimed that the images were [...] "down to the level of 'generic Saturday morning Anime' quality." [...] Nevertheless, RPGFan felt that the story created around Soma was the best presented in the series since Symphony of the Night.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{reception}} was mixed, review tallying website Rotten Tomatoes {{reported a}} rating of 55%, based on a sample of 221 reviews; the site's consensus reading [...] "It's more entertaining than many sequels, but with Oliver Stone directing, a terrific cast, and a timely storyline that picks up where the original left off, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps should be better," [...] for comparison, Wall Street (1987) had achieved a 78% positive rating. Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News awarded it five out of five stars {{saying that it is}} a sharp sequel that is worthy of its investment. He also saluted the cast's performance and noted that Douglas gives Gekko [...] "uncounted layers as he fakes, deals and fuels fire". Matthew Toomey of Australia's 612 ABC Radio Brisbane gave it a B-rating and said that Douglas is the film's [...] "biggest positive", finding LaBeouf to be unconvincing in his role. Christy Lemire, in The Canadian Press, claimed that the film ultimately [...] "goes soft and loses its way" [...] and described the contrast in its final scenes as being [...] "laughable". Furthermore, the subplot between LaBeouf and Mulligan's characters as unneeded and pointed out that their relationship leads viewers to wonder why Winnie, who despises Gekko, would be involved with a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> exactly the same thing as him, which she condemns; however, Lemire acknowledged that the movie is an uncommon sequel that seems to be both relevant and necessary and said that it proves that [...] "greed can still be good". Film critic Colin Newton of the Brisbane Sunday Mail felt that the plot lacked the enthusiasm of the first film. Along the same lines, Village Voice contributor Nick Pinkerton pointed out that the Wall Street sequel did not have the [...] "clean, fable-like arc" [...] formula of its predecessor.|$|E

Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have the poorest access to toilets. In developing countries the cost of a simple pit toilet is typically between 25 and 60 USD. Ongoing maintenance costs are between 1.5 and 4 USD per person per year which are often not taken into consideration.
