5|$|The {{large number}} of {{visitors}} at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as ringed plovers and little terns, and also for wintering geese. During the breeding season, the main breeding areas for terns and seals are fenced off and signposted. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle. A boardwalk <b>made</b> <b>from</b> <b>recycled</b> plastic crosses the large sand dunes {{near the end of}} the Point, which helps to reduce erosion. It was installed in 2009 at a cost of £35,000 to replace its much less durable wooden predecessor.

25|$|In 2003, Unomásunos {{circulation}} in Mexico City was of 7,000. Several of its closes competitors greatly surpassed Unomásunos circulation; La Jornada had 60,000, while Excélsior had 40,000. The following year, Unomásuno {{was not among}} the top newspapers in Mexico with certified daily circulation above 18,000. Its rival Excélsior was on {{the top half of}} the list with 55,492 confirmed daily circulations. Without the financial backing from the PRI that it once benefited from, Unomásuno was unable to increase its daily circulation. It was also because Unomásuno was marginalized by its readers following the defeat of the PRI by the National Action Party (PAN) in the 2000 presidential elections. By 2005, Unomásunos quality and readership had declined, in large due to its publications being characterized with having a cult of personality, yellow journalism, and for reporting gossip short-stories as factual accounts. In addition, the design was not appealing to many its readers, was difficult to read, was sometimes poorly printed, and was <b>made</b> <b>from</b> <b>recycled</b> paper.
