The {{supercritical}} <b>material</b> <b>F</b> 92 {{steel is}} regarded as the research object, and the influence law of heat treatment process on its tissue and properties is analyzed. The results show that when the temperature of heat treatment quenching and tempering is too low, a large number of alloying elements cannot be fully integrated into the austenite, and the optimal obdurability of F 92 steel is still not fully exploited; while too high temperature of heat treatment quenching and tempering will weaken the strength, plasticity and toughness. When F 92 steel is processed by heating quenching at 1050 ℃ and tempering at 680 ℃, its tissue is the smaller tempered lath martensite.

40|$|An {{ecological}} {{description of}} a landscape transcends its geographical definition to characterize {{it in terms of}} a complex agency composed of a spatial mosaic, structured energy, information and meaning. Because the dimensions of the landscape encompasses both natural and human processes, it requires a more robust set of theories that incorporate the material components and their perceptual meaning. A biosemiotic approach defines the landscape as the sum of its organisms’ eco-fields, which are spatial configurations that carry meanings connected to specific needs and related functions. In this perspective, the new postulated General Theory of Resources, offers a substantial contribution to complete the paradigmatic framework of a “private landscape” species-, individual- and function-specific. From this theory resources are considered every <b>material</b> (<b>f.</b> i. food) or immaterial elements (f. i. safety) necessary to fullfill individual needs.

The tendency to actively select positive thoughts suggests the existence of a mechanism to exclude negative content, raising the issue of its dependence on mechanisms like those of effortful control. Using perfusion imaging, we examined how brain activations differed according to whether participants were left to prefer positive thoughts spontaneously, or followed an explicit instruction to the same effect, finding a widespread dissociation of brain perfusion patterns. Under spontaneous processing of emotional material, recruitment of areas associated with effortful attention, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, was reduced relative to instructed avoidance of negative <b>material</b> (<b>F</b> 1, 58 = 26. 24, p = 0. 047, corrected).

Moreover, two severe stresses were applied: plant density and low inputs, in addition to full-inputs conditions. Prisma F 1 and F 2 were better yielding <b>materials</b> than Funo <b>F</b> 1 and F 2, respectively. Until 13. 33 plants m - 2 there was an increase in F 1 field yields, followed by lower yields in increased plant density, since modern hybrids tolerate greater plant populations. Significant interaction between genetic materials and plant density found in full-inputs experiments, was eliminated under the strong low-inputs stress. The indications from Half-sib progeny evaluation showed strong relationship between progeny yield and both selected plants' yield and selection differential. High selection differential was realized under low-inputs condition due to low performance of original genetic materials. Strong allocompetition conditions may have a negative effect on HS progeny yielding performance, since mixtures of different genetic materials lead to lower yields. As a final conclusion, present findings indicated that selection of genotypes must be practiced under conditions of high selection differential. The original population mean is not as important as the selection differential. Extended experimentation must include S 1 and Full-sib progenies and selection of progeny plants must include not only the highest yielding plants, but plants from the upper, mean and lower yielding areas of yield distribution, as well. © 2007 Asian Network for Scientific Information...|$|R
