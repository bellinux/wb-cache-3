500|$|In {{a speech}} in Moscow {{following}} the agreement, Khrushchev declared that the treaty would not end the arms race and by itself could not [...] "avert the danger of war," [...] and reiterated his proposal of a NATO-Warsaw Pact non-aggression accord. For Khrushchev, the test ban negotiations had long been a means of improving the Soviet Union's global image and reducing strain in relations with the West. There are also some indications that military experts within the Soviet Union saw a test ban {{as a way to}} restrict US development of tactical nuclear weapons, which could have increased US willingness to deploy small nuclear weapons on battlefields while circumventing the Soviet nuclear deterrent. Concern that a comprehensive ban would retard modernization of the Soviet arsenal may have pushed Khrushchev towards a partial ban. Counteracting the move towards a partial ban was Khrushchev's interest in reducing spending on testing, as underground testing was more expensive than the atmospheric tests the Soviet Union had been conducting; Khrushchev preferred a comprehensive ban as it would have eliminated the cost of testing entirely. Furthermore, there was internal concern about nuclear proliferation, particularly regarding the prospect of France and China crossing the threshold and the possibility of a <b>multilateral</b> NATO <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> which was seen as a step towards West Germany acquiring nuclear weapons (the first Soviet test ban proposal in 1955 was made in the same month than West Germany joined NATO).|$|R

25|$|Quantum field {{theories}} for {{the strong}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> and the weak <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> {{have also been}} developed. The quantum field theory of the strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> is called quantum chromodynamics, and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles such as quarks and gluons. The weak <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> and the electromagnetic force were unified, in their quantized forms, into a single quantum field theory (known as electroweak theory), by the physicists Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg. These three men shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 for this work.|$|R
5000|$|Besides {{the force}} of gravity and the {{electromagnetic}} forces, there are weak and strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces.</b> Weak <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> are the forces that cause radioactivity, or when [...] emits energy. Weak <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> works on particles with a spin of 1/2. Strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> are the forces that keep the quarks in a neutron and a proton together, and keeps the protons and neutrons together in an atom. The particle that carries the strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> is thought to be a gluon. The gluon is a particle with a spin of 1. The gluon holds together quarks to form protons and neutrons. However, the gluon only holds together quarks that are three different colors. This makes the end product have no color. This is called confinement.|$|R

50|$|Historically, {{the task}} of {{describing}} the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> phenomenologically was formidable. The first semi-empirical quantitative models came in the mid-1950s, such as the Woods-Saxon potential (1954). There was substantial progress in experiment and theory related to the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> in the 1960s and 1970s. One influential model was the Reid potential (1968). In recent years, experimenters have concentrated on the subtleties of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> such as its charge dependence, the precise value of the πNN coupling constant, improved phase shift analysis, high-precision NN data, high-precision NN potentials, NN scattering at intermediate and high energies, and attempts to derive the <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> from QCD.|$|R
40|$|From the {{standpoint}} of the meson theory of <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> results of current analysis on phenomenological nuclear potentials are reexamined. A new method of the theory of <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> is proposed. We employed meson potentials for the outside region, and phenomenological parameters for the inside region of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces.</b> § 1. Problem in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> The phenomenological treatments of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> have long been invest-gated since last ten years, but no definite results were obtained yet. The main reason for it was the scarcity of experimental results to be fitted to and there remained diversity of possibilities. However, as the problem must be treated meson theoretically in its final stage, these possibilities, which do not suggest the connection to or contradict with it, must be put aside. Here we shall investigate some features which the present meson theory imposes to the problem of <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces.</b> A. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>force</b> range Recent developments have introduced two restrictions in the theory of <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces.</b> The one concerns with the force range and the other with the neutron-proton and the proton-proton scattering at high energy region. The former restriction comes from the discovery of two mesons, of which 1 !'-meson interacts strongly with nucleons, while the,u-meson {{has nothing to do with}} the <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces.</b> The mass of 1 !'-meson is observed to be about 275 m. (m, being electron mass) and is heavier than that, assumed hitherto for <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces.</b> This fact indicates that the force range must be taken shorter, i. e., about 1. 3 X 10 - 13 cm. Although this alteration introduces only small effects in the phenomena of neutron-proton system, the quadrupole moment of deuterons is an exception, because it behaves as the inverse square of meson mass and the heavier meson mass reduces its value considerably. To investigate the reduction, we made the calculations, with zero cut-off, assuming the general form of nuclear potential...|$|R
