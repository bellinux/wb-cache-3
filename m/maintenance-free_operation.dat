This has brought about a compact size, light weight and maintenance-free configuration, {{and there has been}} a growing need for further advance in this direction. However, the conventional main circuit system has almost reached the stage of maturity, and it is difficult to expect further improvement from the conventional system. To solve this problem, we have abolished the current drive system (reduction gear unit), and have been committed to achieving a technological innovation through radical system change where the wheel is driven directly by a traction motor.

40|$|In {{this article}} the authors {{consider}} {{the problem of}} simulating the process of a maintenance-free between scheduled maintenance aircraft system operational status changes, which failure during the flight leads to the disaster. On-board equipment with automatic self-repair between routine maintenance in the event the components fail is called <b>maintenance-free.</b> During <b>operation,</b> onboard equipment accumulates failures maintaining its functions with a safety level not lower than the required minimum. Trouble shooting is carried out either {{at the end of}} between-maintenance period (as a rule), or after the failure, which led to the functions disorder or to the decrease below the target level of flight safety (as an exception). The system contains both redundant and nonredundant units and elements with the known failure rates. The system can be in one of the three states: operable, extreme, failed. The excessive redundant elements allow the system to accumulate failures which are repaired during the routine maintenance. The process of system operational status changes is described with the discrete-continuous model in the flight time. Basing on the information about the probabilities of the on-board equipment being in an operable, extreme or failed state, it is possible to calculate such complex efficiency indicators as the average loss of sorties, the average operating costs, the expected number of emergency recovery operations and others. Numerical studies have been conducted to validate the proposed model. It is believed that maintenance work completely updates the system. The analysis of these indicators will allow to evaluate the <b>maintenance-free</b> aircraft equipment <b>operation</b> efficiency, as well as to make an effectiveness comparison with other methods of technical operation. The model can be also used to assess the technical operation systems performance. The model can be used to optimize the period between maintenance...|$|R

30|$|As {{new power}} {{generation}} technologies, NGs {{can be used to}} convert mechanical energy into electricity; on the other hand, by analyzing the electrical output signals (including V oc, J sc, frequency, etc.), information on the mechanical input (magnitude and frequency) can be successfully retrieved [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Since this sensing technology originates from the output signals of the NG itself, no external power source is required to apply onto the device, which is a unique advantage over conventional sensing technologies. Since then, by correlating the mechanical input with many other parameters, various self-powered prototypes have been realized for different practical applications, mainly including two aspects, one is physical sensing system, such as pressure detection [20, 21], motion sensing [22, 23], acoustic sensing [24, 25], security check [26, 27], medical science [28, 29], and even implantable biosensors [30, 31], and another is chemical sensing system, such as water splitting [32, 33], cleaning pollution [34, 35], anti-corrosion protection [36, 37], electrochromic reaction [38, 39], and electrochemical active sensor [40, 41]. Among above-mentioned applications, monitoring the concentration of gases {{is one of the most}} important permanent requirements in many fields of industrial processes as well as in everyday life.

40|$|The {{operation}} of Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks (EHWSNs) {{is a very}} lively area of research. This {{is due to the}} increasing inclination toward green systems, {{in order to reduce the}} energy consumption of human activities at large and to the desire of designing networks that can last unattended indefinitely (see, e. g., the nodes employed in Wireless Sensor Networks, WSNs). Notably, despite recent technological advances, batteries are expected to last for less than ten years for many applications and their replacement is often prohibitively expensive. This problem is particularly severe for urban sensing applications, think of, e. g., sensors placed below the street level to sense the presence of cars in parking lots, where the installation of new power cables is impractical. Other examples include body sensor networks or WSNs deployed in remote geographic areas. In contrast, EHWNs powered by energy scavenging devices (renewable power) provide potentially <b>maintenance-free</b> perpetual network <b>operation,</b> which is particularly appealing, especially for highly pervasive Internet of Things. Lossy temporal compression has been widely recognized as key for Energy Constrained Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), where the imperfect reconstruction of the signal is often acceptable at the data collector, subject to some maximum error tolerance. The first part of this thesis deals with the evaluation of a number of lossy compression methods from the literature, and the analysis of their performance in terms of compression efficiency, computational complexity and energy consumption. Specifically, as a first step, a performance evaluation of existing and new compression schemes, considering linear, autoregressive, FFT-/DCT- and Wavelet-based models is carried out, by looking at their performance as a function of relevant signal statistics. After that, closed form expressions for their overall energy consumption and signal representation accuracy are obtained through numerical fittings. Lastly, the benefits that lossy compression methods bring about in interference-limited multi-hop networks are evaluated. In this scenario the channel access is a source of inefficiency due to collisions and transmission scheduling. The results reveal that the DCT-based schemes are the best option in terms of compression efficiency but are inefficient in terms of energy consumption. Instead, linear methods lead to substantial savings in terms of energy expenditure by, at the same time, leading to satisfactory compression ratios, reduced network delay and increased reliability performance. The subsequent part of the thesis copes with the problem of energy management for EHWSNs where sensor batteries are recharged via the energy harvested through a solar panel and sensors can choose to compress data before transmission. A scenario where a single node communicates with a single receiver is considered. The task of the node is to periodically sense some physical signal and report the measurements to the receiver (sink). We assume that this task is delay tolerant, i. e., the sensor can store a certain number of measurements in the memory buffer and send one or more packets of data after some time. Since most physical signals exhibit strong temporal correlation, the data in the buffer can often be compressed by means of a lossy compression method in order to reduce the amount of data to be sent. Lossy compression schemes allow us to select the compression ratio and trade some accuracy in the data reconstruction at the receiver for more energy savings at the transmitter. Specifically, our objective is to obtain the policy, i. e., the set of decision rules that describe the node behavior, that jointly maximizes throughput and reconstruction fidelity at the sink while meeting some predefined energy constraints, e. g., the battery charge level should never go below a guard threshold. To obtain this policy, the system is modeled as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), and solved through Lagrangian Relaxation and Value Iteration Algorithm. The optimal policies are then compared with heuristic policies in different energy budget scenarios. Moreover the impact of the delay on the knowledge of the Channel State Information is investigated. Two more parts of this thesis deal with the development of models for the generation of space-time correlated signals and for the description of the energy harvested by outdoor photovoltaic panels. The former are very useful to prove the effectiveness of the proposed data gathering solutions as they can be used in the design of accurate simulation tools for WSNs. In addition, they can also be considered as reference models to prove theoretical results for data gathering or compression algorithms. The latter are especially useful in the investigation and in the optimization of EHWSNs. These models will be presented at the beginning and then intensively used for the analysis and the performance evaluation of the schemes that are treated in the remainder of the thesis...|$|R

40|$|The {{avionics}} {{concept of}} the maintenance-free on-board equipment implies the absence of necessity to maintain onboard systems between scheduled maintenance, preserving the required operational and technical characteristics; it should be achieved by automatic diagnosis of the technical condition {{and the application of}} active means of ensuring a failsafe design, allowing to change the structure of the system to maintain its functions in case of failure. It is supposed that such equipment will reduce substantially and in the limit eliminate traditional maintenance of aircraft between scheduled maintenance, ensuring maximum readiness for use, along with improving safety. The paper proposes a methodology for evaluating the efficiency of maintenance-free between scheduled maintenance aircraft system with homogeneous redundancy. The excessive redundant elements allow the system to accumulate failures which are repaired during the routine maintenance. If the number of failures of any reserve is approaching a critical value, the recovery of the on-board system (elimination of all failures) is carried out between scheduled maintenance by conducting rescue and recovery operations. It is believed that service work leads to the elimination of all failures and completely updates the on-board system. The process of system operational status changes is described with the discrete-continuous model in the flight time. The average losses in the sorties and the average cost of operation are used as integrated efficiency indicators of system operation. For example, the evaluation of the operation efficiency of formalized on-board system with homogeneous redundancy demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed methodology and the possibility of its use while analyzing the efficiency of the <b>maintenance-free</b> <b>operation</b> equipment between scheduled periods.
