500|$|What happened? I {{signed a}} shitty deal, but luckily it was non-exclusive. I {{got tired of}} doing Strapping so I said, 'I can't do it anymore.' Then I freaked out and went into a hospital. <b>My</b> <b>lawyer</b> said that I was under mental duress when I signed the {{contract}} so the contract is void. At that point it was like, 'I just won't do another Strapping record.' Yeah, I went down saying 'CM was the shittiest label ever.' And they went down as saying that I was 'a complete, arrogant psychopath.' ...|$|E
500|$|In April, Diplo told The Huffington Post that he {{had reached}} an {{agreement}} to clear the samples. However, in an August interview with Pitchfork, Baauer {{said that he has}} not made any money from the song, despite Diplo's reported agreement: [...] "I'm meeting with <b>my</b> <b>lawyer</b> ... so I'm gonna find that out. I think it's mostly because of all the legal shit. I didn’t clear the samples because I was in my fucking bedroom on Grand Street. I wasn't going to think to call up , I didn’t even know who it was who did that I knew the Jayson Musson [...] So I found myself in that fucking pickle. Legal letters and shit. Ugh. Lawyers. So exposure-wise it was fantastic, but everything else..." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{planning}} to perform [...] "Frozen" [...] in Werchter? I didn't expect anything else, you know. I don't even mind. It just {{would be nice}} because I would finally get some money after all these years, because the case is still going on. I'm {{certainly not going to}} the concert. <b>My</b> <b>lawyer</b> is following the case. I'm really going to follow Madonna's concert with interest, because she really can't perform the song. Yet, I think we won't immediately take steps. The court's decision is subject to various interpretations. The song can't be played on the radio or be sold, but have we arguments enough for the concert to be over? We won't bring additional spectacle to the show. Unnecessary scandals, with Madonna it's guaranteed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly!" [...] I answered. [...] "I {{have not}} communicated even with <b>my</b> <b>lawyers.</b> <b>My</b> substitute's fate {{was enough to}} make me careful!" ...|$|R
60|$|So off I went--with my visitor all {{encouraging}} {{smiles as}} he opened the door for me--to fetch <b>my</b> <b>lawyer's</b> bombshell.|$|R
60|$|I drove {{at once to}} {{the office}} of <b>my</b> <b>lawyers.</b> The senior partner--the tried friend and adviser of our family--received me.|$|R
500|$|In 1990, Ralph Bakshi {{decided that}} it was time to make another {{animated}} film. According to Bakshi, [...] "I made 1,500 bucks in 10 years of painting; I thought it would be nice to pick up a piece of change. So I called <b>my</b> <b>lawyer,</b> who was still speaking to me because no one ever leaves Hollywood, and asked him where I should go to sell a movie." [...] Bakshi pitched Cool World to Paramount Pictures (where Bakshi had worked as the final head of the studio's animation division) as an animated horror film. The concept of the film involved a cartoon and live action human having sex and conceiving a hybrid child who visits the real world to murder the father who abandoned her. Bakshi states that Paramount Pictures [...] "bought the idea in ten seconds".|$|E
2500|$|... "To this day, I {{believe there}} was some kind of {{collaboration}} between <b>my</b> <b>lawyer</b> and the prosecution. Riker's [...] Island was supposed to have been built for rehabilitation, but it was the worst place in the world for a kid to try and straighten out his life. I often wonder why I never came out of there a criminal. With all the characters and perverts I met, it certainly would have been the easy way to go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. The other's coming. Silas Watson, <b>my</b> <b>lawyer,</b> {{has just}} telegraphed from New York that he's {{bringing}} Patricia back with him." ...|$|E
5000|$|Not much to {{tell about}} this matter. I have {{made a deal with}} <b>my</b> <b>lawyers.</b> Sometime in the near future, {{something}} will happen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you let me}} ask {{the advice}} of <b>my</b> <b>lawyers?</b> They are {{trustworthy}} and experienced men, and I am sure they can be of use to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. <b>My</b> <b>lawyers</b> {{have written}} to Mrs. Jennett, and I've {{got to be}} educated somewhere,--in France, perhaps,--I don'tknow where; but I shall be glad to go away." ...|$|R
6000|$|LORD GORING. I am {{under the}} {{impression}} that <b>my</b> <b>lawyer</b> settled that matter with you on certain terms [...] . dictated by yourself.|$|E
6000|$|... "To <b>my</b> <b>lawyer</b> in Edinburgh. There {{will be no}} time unless I do it now. We {{start for}} Switzerland this afternoon--don't we?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Right as ninepence," [...] {{he replied}} genially. [...] "I’ve been with <b>my</b> <b>lawyer</b> all the arternoon, pretty near. ’E’s a nice feller." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I say--no one else. My own love, when may it be? <b>My</b> <b>lawyers</b> {{can get the}} {{settlements}} ready in a fortnight, or less. Will you say in a fortnight?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly. If {{you have}} any threat to make, you had better make it in writing. You can write to <b>my</b> <b>lawyers,</b> or to me, or to Lord Hampstead, or to Mr. Roberts." ...|$|R
60|$|He bustled away then, evidently {{anxious to}} escape any further conversation. I went about my business, which {{consisted}} of a visit to <b>my</b> <b>lawyer's</b> {{and a couple of}} rubbers of bridge at my club before dinner.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I've {{promised him}} that we should go {{together}} to <b>my</b> <b>lawyer</b> to-morrow, and begin a suit against the proprietors of the 'Clarion.'" ...|$|E
60|$|From this I {{inferred}} that <b>my</b> <b>lawyer</b> {{friend had}} thought as Mr. Banker did--that I was innocent. This gave me {{not a little}} satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not? <b>My</b> <b>lawyer</b> is ready. There are no {{preparations}} to make. You {{said when}} you accepted {{me that it}} was to be a private marriage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{telephone}} home," [...] she replied. [...] "If {{that woman}} {{is still in}} the house, I shall go down into the country, and from there I shall write <b>my</b> <b>lawyers</b> and apply for a separation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As soon as possible, {{an agent}} {{will be sent}} to Peru to attend to the matter. But this matter {{is in the hands of}} <b>my</b> <b>lawyers,</b> although, of course, I shall not keep out of the negotiations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “This, sir, is the {{certificate}} of my baptism at St. Matthew’s Church, Westminster. This {{is a statement}} of <b>my</b> <b>lawyer’s</b> clerk, who interviewed the woman in whose house {{my father and mother}} lived, and my mother died.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Joe," [...] {{the other}} called. [...] "You see <b>my</b> <b>lawyer</b> {{tomorrow}} morning. Five hundred down and two hundred a month {{as long as}} you stay away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Her uncle is Phineas Duge," [...] Guy said. [...] "He {{has given}} his consent to our marriage, {{and told me}} to send <b>my</b> <b>lawyer</b> to him to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear young lady," [...] he said,--"if {{you really}} want to compromise--for a {{moderate}} amount--I will send for <b>my</b> <b>lawyer.</b> We cannot arrange this thing by ourselves." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{whether or}} not the world will ever know more of the power of {{negative}} gravity depends entirely upon the disposition of my son Herbert, when--after a good many years, I hope--he shall open the packet <b>my</b> <b>lawyers</b> have in keeping.|$|R
6000|$|... "I--that is--yes--it's {{a painful}} affair, mem," [...] he said, giving {{one look at}} her pale face, and then turning away in a flurry. [...] "I beg to refer you to Blunt, Hone, and Sharpus, <b>my</b> <b>lawyers,</b> mem," [...] he added, {{collecting}} himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{my little}} girl!" [...] he said hoarsely. [...] "I'd {{like to leave}} her something. If the thing turns out big, Trent, you can spare a small share. There's a letter here! It's to <b>my</b> <b>lawyers.</b> They'll {{tell you all about}} her." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{the judge}} that spoke. The {{interpreter}} whispered to me that I must keep perfectly still. He said that no statement would be received from me--I must only talk through <b>my</b> <b>lawyer.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing of the sort," [...] {{her friend}} {{pronounced}} positively. [...] "Marriage, {{by the law}} of England (as <b>my</b> <b>lawyer</b> tells me), {{is nothing but a}} contract. Who ever heard of profaning a contract?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it has: I'll {{not deny}} my name, {{and if there}} be {{absolute}} need I will pay it; but, if I do so, <b>my</b> <b>lawyer</b> shall sift it, and it shall go before a jury." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He wins {{because he}} does not care about losing. I think {{there can be little doubt}} but that he is very well to do. His mother's law-agents are <b>my</b> <b>lawyers,</b> and they write that the {{property}} is quite a principality, and grows richer every year." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I {{thought you}} English {{like what you}} call a joke,’ replied the lady calmly. ‘As a matter of fact, he is <b>my</b> <b>lawyer’s</b> clerk, and has been here to-night charged with {{disastrous}} news. I am in sore straits, Señor Harry. Will you help me?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mine," [...] said Marston, rather shortly. [...] "All the same, I imagine Mabel would approve. But {{this has}} nothing to do with it and you needn't invent an object for me. I'm looking for a good investment. <b>My</b> <b>lawyers</b> only get me three or four per cent." ...|$|R
