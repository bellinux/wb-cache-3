Martin Olson, one of the writers for Rocko's <b>Modern</b> <b>Life,</b> read The Intertidal Zone and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not even considered creating his own series. However, he realized that if he ever did, this would be the best approach. Production on Rocko's <b>Modern</b> <b>Life</b> ended in 1996. Shortly afterwards, Hillenburg began working on SpongeBob SquarePants.|$|E

5|$|<b>Modern</b> <b>Life</b> Is Rubbish was a {{moderate}} chart {{success in the}} UK; the album peaked at number 15, while the singles taken from the album charted in the Top 30. Applauded by the music press, the album's Anglocentric rhetoric rejuvenated the group's fortunes after their post-Leisure slump. <b>Modern</b> <b>Life</b> Is Rubbish is {{regarded as one of}} the defining releases of the Britpop scene, and its chart-topping follow-ups—Parklife and The Great Escape—saw Blur emerge as one of Britain's leading pop acts.|$|E

5|$|Central to the {{structure}} and plot {{of the show is}} the use of electronic surveillance and wiretap technologies by the police—hence the title The Wire. Salon.com described the title {{as a metaphor for the}} viewer's experience: the wiretaps provide the police with access to a secret world, just as the show does for the viewer. Simon has discussed the use of camera shots of surveillance equipment, or shots that appear to be taken from the equipment itself, to emphasize the volume of surveillance in <b>modern</b> <b>life</b> and the characters' need to sift through this information.|$|E
5|$|During Watts's lifetime, European culture {{had begun}} to {{question}} the concept of hope. A new school of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, {{and the importance of}} material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making <b>modern</b> <b>life</b> increasingly soulless.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the ideas}} for the series {{originated}} in an unpublished educational comic book titled The Intertidal Zone, which Hillenburg created in 1989. He began developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series in 1996 upon the cancellation of Rocko's <b>Modern</b> <b>Life,</b> and turned to Tom Kenny, {{who had worked with}} him on that series, to voice the title character. SpongeBob was originally going to be named SpongeBoy, and the series was to be called SpongeBoy Ahoy!, but both of these were changed, as the name was already trademarked.|$|E
5|$|<b>Modern</b> <b>Life</b> Is Rubbish is {{the second}} studio album by the English {{alternative}} rock band Blur, released in May 1993. Although their debut album Leisure (1991) had been commercially successful, Blur faced a severe media backlash soon after its release, and fell out of public favour. After the group returned from an unsuccessful tour of the United States, poorly received live performances and the rising popularity of rival band Suede further diminished Blur's status in the UK.|$|E

He had, for 40 years, conducted programs on Jewish topics on radio station WEVD, then owned by The Forward. In the 1970s he was {{a columnist for the}} Yiddish weekly Algemeiner Journal, and was the author of the English-language books Israel's Wisdom in <b>Modern</b> <b>Life</b> (1949) and Seeing Through Believing (1973).

5|$|SpongeBob SquarePants is an American {{animated}} {{television series}} created by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg for Nickelodeon. The series {{is set in}} the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom, and centers on the adventures and endeavors of SpongeBob SquarePants, an over-optimistic sea sponge that annoys other characters. Many of the ideas for the show originated in an unpublished, educational comic book titled The Intertidal Zone, which Hillenburg created in the mid-1980s. He began developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series in 1996 after the cancellation of Rocko's <b>Modern</b> <b>Life,</b> another Nickelodeon television series that Hillenburg previously directed.|$|E
5|$|Squidward's {{voice is}} {{provided}} by actor Rodger Bumpass, who voices several other SpongeBob SquarePants characters, including Squidward's mother. While creating the show and writing its pilot episode in 1997, Hillenburg and the show's then-creative director Derek Drymon were also conducting voice auditions. Mr. Lawrence, {{who had worked with}} Hillenburg and Drymon on Rocko's <b>Modern</b> <b>Life,</b> was Hillenburg's first choice for the role. Hillenburg had invited Lawrence to audition for all the show's characters. Instead of Squidward, Hillenburg decided to give Lawrence the part of Plankton, the series' villain.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to eschew scripts for storyboards {{is one that}} Hillenburg made {{early on in the}} series' development. Rocko's <b>Modern</b> <b>Life</b> had also used storyboarding, and having worked on that series, Hillenburg felt strongly about adopting the process for SpongeBob SquarePants— even though Nickelodeon was beginning to show greater preference for script-driven cartoons. Another writer for the series, Merriwether Williams, described in an interview that she and Mr. Lawrence would write a draft for an episode in an afternoon and be done at 4 o'clock.|$|E

5|$|Work on The Simpsons {{involved}} an irregular schedule. The producers laid off the animation staff for two-to-three-month periods, and rehired the staff {{later in the}} production cycle.
