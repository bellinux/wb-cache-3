5|$|Irving's {{writings}} on Columbus are {{a mixture of}} history and fiction, a genre now called romantic history. Irving based them on extensive research in the Spanish archives, but also added imaginative elements aimed at sharpening the story. The first of these works {{is the source of}} the durable <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> medieval Europeans believed the Earth was flat. (See Myth of the flat earth.) According to the popular book, Columbus proved the Earth was round.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people believe}} the urban <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> the daddy longlegs Opiliones {{have the most}} {{poisonous}} bite in the spider world, but that the fangs {{are too small to}} penetrate human skin. This is untrue on several counts. None of the known species of harvestmen have venom glands; their chelicerae are not hollowed fangs but grasping claws that are typically very small and definitely not strong enough to break human skin.|$|E
5|$|The same {{elements}} from the <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> {{appear in the}} Pyramid Texts recur in funerary texts written in later times, such as the Coffin Texts from the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BCE) and the Book of the Dead from the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BCE). Most of these writings were made for the general populace, so unlike the Pyramid Texts, they link Osiris with all deceased souls, not exclusively with royalty.|$|E

5|$|Given this, it {{is unfortunate}} that the Cypria—the part of the Epic Cycle that covers the period of the Trojan War of Troilus' death—does not survive. Indeed, no {{complete}} narrative of his story remains from archaic times or the subsequent classical period (479–323 BC). Most of the literary sources from before the Hellenistic age (323–30 BC) that even referred to the character are lost or survive only in fragments or summary. The surviving ancient and medieval sources, whether literary or scholarly, contradict each other, and many do not tally with the form of the <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> scholars now believe to have existed in the archaic and classical periods.|$|E

5|$|Many {{writers in}} the early 20th century perpetuated a <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> Thespis ran only a month and was {{considered}} a failure. In fact, it remained open until 8 March. Of the nine London pantomimes that appeared during the 1871–72 holiday season, five closed before Thespis did. By its nature, the genre did not lend itself to long runs, and all nine had closed {{by the end of}} March. Moreover, the Gaiety normally only ran productions for two or three weeks; the run of Thespis was extraordinary for the theatre.|$|E
5|$|The European {{nightjar}}, Eurasian nightjar or just nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus) is a crepuscular and {{nocturnal bird}} in the nightjar family that breeds across most of Europe and temperate Asia. The Latin generic name refers to the old <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> the nocturnal nightjar suckled goats, causing them to cease to give milk. The six subspecies differ clinally, the birds becoming smaller and paler towards {{the east of the}} range. All populations are migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. Their densely patterned grey and brown plumage makes individuals difficult to see in the daytime when they rest on the ground or perch motionless along a branch, although the male shows white patches in the wings and tail as he flies at night.|$|E
5|$|The Poles {{had little}} {{interest}} or desire {{to support the}} French cause in the distant colonies, once again fighting against people who only desired their own independence. In Haiti there still is a popular <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> many Polish soldiers became sympathetic to the former slaves' cause and deserted the French, supporting Jean-Jacques Dessalines in significant numbers, with entire units changing sides. In fact, the actual desertion rate was much lower; nonetheless about 150 Polish soldiers joined the Haitian rebels. The loss of that many patriotic military personnel in the Caribbean was a serious blow to the Polish aspirations for regaining independence. The Haitian experience cast further doubts among Poles about France's and Napoleon's good intentions toward Poland.|$|E

5|$|Gamble's men mounted {{determined}} {{resistance and}} delaying tactics from behind fence posts with rapid fire from their breech-loading carbines. It {{is a modern}} <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> they were armed with multi-shot repeating carbines. Nevertheless, {{they were able to}} fire two or three times faster than a muzzle-loaded carbine or rifle. Also, the breech-loading design meant that Union troops did not have to stand to reload and could do so safely behind cover. This was a great advantage over the Confederates, who still had to stand to reload, thus providing an easier target. But this was so far a relatively bloodless affair. By 10:20 a.m., the Confederates had reached Herr Ridge and had pushed the Federal cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the I Corps finally arrived, the division of Maj. Gen. James S. Wadsworth. The troops were led personally by Gen. Reynolds, who conferred briefly with Buford and hurried back to bring more men forward.|$|E
5|$|Gulls {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} seen seabirds, given their use of human-made habitats (such as cities and dumps) and their often fearless nature. They therefore also have made it into the popular consciousness – they have been used metaphorically, as in Jonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach, or to denote a closeness to the sea, such as their use in The Lord of the Rings both in the insignia of Gondor and therefore Númenor (used in the design of the films), and to call Legolas to (and across) the sea. Other species have also made an impact; pelicans have long been associated with mercy and altruism because of an early Western Christian <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> they split open their breast to feed their starving chicks.|$|E
5|$|It is {{a popular}} <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> {{so-called}} murder-holes– openings in {{the ceiling of the}} gateway passage– were used to pour boiling oil or molten lead on attackers; the price of oil and lead and the distance of the gatehouse from fires meant that this was impractical. This method was, however, a common practice in the MENA region and the Mediterranean castles and fortifications where such resources were abundant. They were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, or to allow water to be poured on fires to extinguish them. Provision was made in the upper storey of the gatehouse for accommodation so the gate was never left undefended, although this arrangement later evolved to become more comfortable at the expense of defence.|$|E

5|$|The art {{historian}} Hendrik Frederik Wijnman disproved the <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> Ruisdael died a poor man, supposedly {{in the old}} men's almshouse in Haarlem. Wijnman showed {{that the person who}} died there was in fact Ruisdael's cousin, Jacob Salomonszoon. Although there is no record of Ruisdael owning land or shares, he appears to have lived comfortably, even after the economic downturn of the disaster year 1672. His paintings were valued fairly highly. In a large sample of inventories between 1650 and 1679 the average price for a Ruisdael was 40 guilders, compared to an average of 19 guilders for all attributed paintings. In a ranking of contemporary Dutch painters based on price-weighted frequency in these inventories, Ruisdael ranks seventh; Rembrandt ranks first.|$|E
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing. However, it is a <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> sheep cannot lamb without human assistance; many ewes give birth directly in pasture without aid. This can be proven {{by the fact}} that they give birth in the wild. Balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding. While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require intervention, many complications may arise. A lamb may present in the normal fashion (with both legs and head forward), but may simply be too large to slide out of the birth canal. This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes (this is related to breed, rams are naturally larger than ewes by comparison). Lambs may also present themselves with one shoulder to the side, completely backward, or with only some of their limbs protruding. Lambs may also be spontaneously aborted or stillborn. Reproductive failure is a common consequence of infections such as toxoplasmosis and foot-and-mouth disease. Some types of abortion in sheep are preventable by vaccinations against these infections.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the breed lived in the northern river valleys of the Sambre and the Scheldt, near Valenciennes. Although it is a popular <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> many French draft breeds, including the Trait du Nord, are descendants of the prehistoric horses found at Solutré, this is not true. Two or possibly three subspecies of now-extinct equines have been found at Solutré, {{but there is no}} evidence that they migrated to the area that later produced the Trait du Nord. Like Dutch and Belgian draft breeds such as the Brabant, the origin of the Trait du Nord is found in the large, fertile Flemish grasslands that cover the southern portion of the Netherlands, northern France and all of Belgium. The Hainaut region is the true birthplace of the breed in France. The Belgian draft breeds, the Ardennes and the Trait du Nord share the same ancestry, and the Trait du Nord has a history that is very similar to the Ardennes, due to the influence of the latter breed on the former. The Ardennes, Belgian, Dutch Heavy Draft, Trait du Nord and Auxois are all considered to come from the same group of breeds, due to their heritage, physical characteristics and selection for draft work. Until relatively recently, the breeds were not differentiated, and were frequently crossbred.|$|E
