40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{describe}} a simple method to ex-tract the average drift mobility and the apparent sheet electron density versus the applied gate voltage and the vertical effective electric field in strained-Si–SiGe buried-channel depletion-mode metal–oxide <b>semiconductor</b> <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistors</b> (n-MOSFETs). For this, we adapted an established technique used in evaluating mobility profiles in Schottky-gate MESFETs, by taking into ac-count the existence in our devices of the gate-oxide capacitance OX and by introducing an effective junction capacitance, which follows the ideal Schottky’s depletion approximation. By applying our method on fabricated transistors {{we were able}} to obtain the average drift mobility profile versus the applied vertical effective field and monitor values as high as 618 cm 2 /Vs. We also extracted the apparent sheet electron density profile with values reaching as high as 3 4 1012 cm 2. Although the layer design had not been optimized, the results show mobility enhancement in the strained silicon channel and, to our view, point to a unique regime of operation for these devices, which should benefit the low-power and low-voltage applications. The proposed method {{could be used as a}} nondestructive tool for monitoring the transport properties in Si–SiGe modulation-doped MOSFETs.

30|$|We {{present a}} novel concept for {{modulating}} the channel transport by all-electronic means. The working principle {{is based on}} the electronic structure modulation of a midgap or a near-midgap state due to an electric field by applying a gate voltage. Small bandwidths (BW) have large effective masses and hence poor transport characteristics due to strong scattering. This leads to the off state of the transistor. The on state has a large bandwidth and hence smaller effective mass, which gives the higher desired conduction. The proposed transistor, namely electronic structure modulation transistor (EMT), has also been analyzed as a possible replacement for metal oxide <b>semiconductor</b> <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistor</b> technology [1].|$|R
