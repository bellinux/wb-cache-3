50|$|Some monocots, such as grasses, have hypogeal emergence, {{where the}} <b>mesocotyl</b> elongates and pushes the {{coleoptile}} (which encloses and protects the shoot tip) toward the soil surface.

Many dicots have epigeal emergence, in which the hypocotyl elongates and becomes arched in the soil. As the hypocotyl continues to elongate, it pulls the cotyledons upward, above the soil surface.|$|E

50|$|The early {{development}} of a monocot seedling like cereals and other grasses is somewhat different. A structure called the coleoptile, essentially {{a part of the}} cotyledon, protects the young stem and plumule as growth pushes them up through the soil. A mesocotyl—that part of the young plant that lies between the seed (which remains buried) and the plumule—extends the shoot up to the soil surface, where secondary roots develop from just beneath the plumule. The primary root from the radicle may then fail to develop further. The <b>mesocotyl</b> is considered to be partly hypocotyl and partly cotyledon (see seed).|$|E

The predominant orienta-tion of MTs became more longitudinal within 1 h in epidermal cells and changed from transverse to oblique, after the elongation ceased, in parenchymal cells. Irradiation with red and with blue light also caused cessation of cell elongation and the same changes in the orientation of MTs. Elongation of Avena coleoptiles ceased as a result of irradiation with white light within 24 h. The predominant orientation of MTs became more longitudinal in epidermal cells and changed from transverse to oblique in parenchymal cells. The change in orientation of MTs in epidermal cells preceded that in parenchymal cells. In Pisum epicotyls, elongation ceased as a result of ir-radiation with white light within 1 h. Although the orientations of MTs in epidermal cells did not show any remarkable change, those in parenchymal cells changed from transverse to oblique after cell elongation ceased. The change in orientation of MTs and the cessation of cell elongation of A vena <b>mesocotyls</b> in-duced by white-light irradiation were both significantly retarded by treatment with IAA. This result suggests that IAA is involved in maintaining the transverse orientation of MTs in Avena <b>mesocotyls...</b>|$|R

The highest frequency of shoot regeneration was achieved using <b>mesocotyls</b> derived from in vitro grown seeds cultured on Murashige and Skoogs, basal medium without growth regulators, when cultured on medium supplemented with Benzyl Adenine (BA) 0. 5 mg/l under subdued light at 25 °C ± 2 °C. Under these conditions <b>mesocotyls</b> (Plurality of meristems) produced 3 to 4 tiller shoots in primary culture.

Through callusing phase different rice cultivars produced different percentage of callusing however Basmati 370 gave high percentage in response to callussing, organogenesis and root formation. In between these two methods, the direct shoot regeneration gave 80 % - 100 % result besides the wild species in respect with their genotype whereas the indirect organogenesis gave only 10 % - 30 % of plantlets.

Murai et al.

Chung (2010) reported positive correlations between the rate of seedling emergence and <b>mesocotyl</b> or coleoptile length at 5  cm seeding depth by using 116 Korean weedy rice accessions. Alibu et al. (2012) suggested that upland rice accessions with long <b>mesocotyl</b> showed better seedling emergence than those with long coleoptile under the dry direct-seeding condition. Lu et al.

Inoculation with C. heterostrophus resulted in rapid accumulation of PR- 10 and CHS transcripts after appressoria had become mature. Accumulation of these transcripts was delayed in plants inoculated with C. sublineolum until penetration of host tissue had been completed and infection vesicles had formed.

Bacterially expressed ZmMET 1 actively methylated DNA in vitro. Transcripts of ZmMET 1 could be shown to exclusively accumulate in actively proliferating cells of the meristems of <b>mesocotyls</b> and root apices, suggesting ZmMET 1 expression {{to be associated with}} DNA replication. This was confirmed by simultaneous decrease of transcripts of ZmMET 1 and histone H 3, a marker for DNA replication, in seedlings exposed to wounding, desiccation and salinity, all of which suppress cell division.

In contrast, however, accumulation of ZmMET 1 transcripts in shoot <b>mesocotyls</b> was not affected by cold stress, whereas those for H 3 sharply decreased. Such a differential accumulation of ZmMET 1 transcripts was consistent with ZmMET 1 protein levels as revealed by western blotting. Expression of ZmMET 1 is thus coexistent, but not completely dependent on DNA replication. Southern hybridization analysis with a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme revealed that cold treatment induced demethylation of DNA in the Ac/Ds transposon region, but not in other genes, and that such demethylation primarily occurred in roots.

40|$|In grass {{seedlings}} {{the network}} of cortical microtubules is reorganized during light-dependent growth of coleoptiles and <b>mesocotyls.</b> We investigated the effects of light-dependent growth on the relative steady-state levels of the mRNAs and protein levels of α-tubulin and the ε-subunit of the chaperonin containing tailless complex protein- 1 in oat (Avena sativa) coleoptiles, which were grown in different light conditions to establish different growth responses. The soluble pools of the ε-subunit of the chaperonin containing tailless complex protein- 1 and α-tubulin decreased in nonelongating coleoptiles, suggesting that {{the dynamics of the}} light-regulated soluble pool reflect the processes occurring during reorganization of cortical microtubules. The shifts in pool sizes are discussed in relation to the machinery that controls the dynamic structure of cortical microtubules in plant cells...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Effects of {{chilling}} and acclimation on {{the activity}} of cytosolic (GS 1) and plastidic (GS 2) isoforms of glutamine synthetase (E. C. 6. 3. 1. 2) were studied in chilling-sensitive and acclimation-responsive maize inbred G 50. Glutamine synthetase activity in <b>mesocotyls</b> and roots of chilled (7 d/ 4 o C) and rewarmed (1 d/ 27 o C) etiolated plants was ≈ 1 / 3 that of controls. In coleoptiles+leaves of light-grown plants, GS 1 was reduced to 75 %, and GS 2 to 50 %. Acclimation (3 d/ 14 o C) increased GS activity and alleviated the effects of chilling. Exposure to H 2 O 2 or menadione also reduced GS activity. Since chilling causes oxidative stress in maize, acclimation probably preserves GS activity by protecting GS from oxidative inactivation...|$|R
40|$|Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) accumulates the {{anthocyanin}} cyanidin 3 -dimalonyl glucoside in etiolated <b>mesocotyls</b> {{in response}} to light. Inoculation with the nonpathogenic fungus Cochliobolus heterostrophus drastically reduced the light-induced accumulation of anthocyanin by repressing the transcription of the anthocyanin biosynthesis genes encoding flavanone 3 -hydroxylase, dihydroflavonol 4 -reductase, and anthocyanidin synthase. In contrast to these repression effects, fungal inoculation resulted in the synthesis of the four known 3 -deoxyanthocyanidin phytoalexins and a corresponding activation of genes encoding the key branch-point enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonialyase and chalcone synthase. In addition, a gene encoding the pathogenesis-related protein PR- 10 was strongly induced {{in response to}} inoculation. The accumulation of phytoalexins leveled off by 48 h after inoculation and {{was accompanied by a}} more rapid increase in the rate of anthocyanin accumulation. The results suggest that the plant represses less essential metabolic activities such as anthocyanin synthesis as a means of compensating for the immediate biochemical and physiological needs for the defense response. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
