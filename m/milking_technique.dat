40|$|In {{this case}} report an {{approach}} to dealing with a herd with a high bulk milk somatic cell count is described. By the time the farmer requested help, the situation had already become so serious that the delivery of milk had been prohibited for two weeks. Bacteriological examination of the milk revealed that some cows were infected with major pathogens and that many cows were infected with Corynebacterium bovis and/or coagulase-negative staphylococci. On the basis of these results and the results of the dynamic measurement of the milking machine, a plan of action was outlined. This strategy consisted of an adjustment of the milking machine, an improvement of the <b>milking</b> <b>technique</b> and the treatment with antibiotics of a number of cows. After the initial treatment, the bulk milk somatic cell count remained too high. Subsequently, cows with an elevated individual somatic cell count were again sampled for bacteriological culture.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to review the origin of animal {{domestication}} and milking of domesticated animals and then study the transitional history of <b>milk</b> processing <b>techniques</b> in the Eurasian Continent. Pastoralism, one mode of subsistence, was a result of the invention of <b>milking</b> <b>techniques.</b> As the results, human being could have adapted by using animal products with agricultural products to the land where was more disadvantageous to residential environment. In the history of pastoralism, milking has been considered an important factor concerned with the use of animals as a food resource as well as the management, breeding, and selection of livestock. Stable isotope analysis of fatty acids extracted from archaeological vessels revealed that the milking and milk consumption were already started by seven millennium B. C. at least in West Asia. On the basis of archeological evidence, interregional comparison of existing milk processing systems, and analysis of the physiology and interactive behavior between female animals and their offspring, we propose the monism-bipolarization hypothesis of milk culture in the Eurasian Continent. That is, animal domestication, milking, and milk consumption originated in West Asia and spread to surrounding areas such as Central Asia and South Asia, and then, <b>milking</b> <b>techniques</b> were separately developed in the northern and southern Eurasian Continent. Cream separation, butter oil processing from cream by heating, the use of fermented milk as the solidifying-additive, alcoholic fermented milk producing in the northern Eurasian Continent, and extraction of fat from fermented milk by churning and rennet using as the solidifying-additive in the southern Eurasian Continent were attempted separately.

40|$|International audienceStaphylococci are {{the main}} {{aetiological}} agents of small ruminants intramammary infections (IMI), the more frequent isolates being S. aureus in clinical cases and coagulase negative species in subclinical IMI. The clinical IMI, whose annual incidence is usually lower than 5 %, mainly occur {{at the beginning of}} machine milking and during the first third of lactation. These features constitute small ruminant peculiarities compared to dairy cattle. Small ruminant mastitis is generally a chronic and contagious infection: the primary sources are mammary and cutaneous carriages, and spreading mainly occurs during milking. Somatic cell counts (SCC) represent a valuable tool for prevalence assessment and screening, but predictive values are better in ewes than in goats. Prevention is most often based on milking machine management, sanitation and annual control, and <b>milking</b> <b>technique</b> optimisation. Elimination mainly relies on culling animals exhibiting clinical, chronic and recurrent IMI, and on drying-off intramammary antibiotherapy; this treatment allows a good efficacy and may be used selectively by targeting infected udders only. Heritability values for lactation mean SCC scores are between 0. 11 and 0. 15. Effective inclusion of ewe's mastitis resistance in the breeding goal has recently been implemented in France following experimental and large scale estimations of genetic parameters for SCC scores...|$|E
40|$|The milk {{processing}} system and uses of milk products were surveyed in Sumbawa and West Sumatra，Indonesia to understand those characteristics in Indonesia，and to discuss an origin of <b>milking</b> <b>techniques</b> in Indonesia. The milking is conducted from mares in Sumbawa and from water buffaloes in West Sumatra. In both these areas，the <b>technique</b> of fermented <b>milk</b> processing series is adopted such us the natural fermentation of raw milk by maintaining it under non-pasteurization conditions for 1 or 2 nights. Both raw milk and fermented milk {{are used as}} supplementary food and not {{considered part of the}} staple diet of the inhabitants of Sumbawa and West Sumatra. On the basis of the following observations， it is concluded that the <b>milking</b> <b>techniques</b> used in Indonesia are actually derived from those used in India: 1) the marked difference between the milking techniques，{{milk processing}} systems，and uses of milk products in Indonesia and those in northern Asian area，where milking from mares is conducted; 2) the similarity between the milking techniques， milk processing systems，and uses of milk products in Sumbawa and West Sumatra; 3) the long and close relationship between Indonesia and India through seaborne trade {{and the fact that the}} word dadih，which refers to a traditional Indonesian fermented milk product，finds its origin in India. Year-round reproductive activity in ruminants from regions that lie to the right of the equator and the abundance of plant-based foods in these regions are considered the core factors responsible for the failure of most of the <b>milk</b> processing <b>techniques</b> in Indonesia; consequently， Indonesians use milk products as supplementary food，a nd not as part of their regular diet. アジア，北アジア，中央アジア，南アジア，ヨーロッパ，アフリカの一部と，主に乾燥地を中心とした地域で ある(Fig. 1) 。 Fig. 1 は， 15 世紀をおおよその目安と して作図されたものである。新大陸の北米・南米，アフ リカの一部，オセアニア地域，東アジア，そして，東南 アジアでは，伝統的に搾乳が行なわれてこなかったこと が理解される。インドネシアも本来は乳文化圏ではなか った。しかし，東アジアでは斉民要術 1) や本草鋼目 2) な どの古文書が示す通り，貴族集団で乳利用が薬的に利用 されていた。非乳文化圏とされる地域での乳利用は，乳文化圏から非乳文化圏への乳利用の伝播や変遷を考察す る上で極めて興味深い。 インドネシアにおいても，スンバワ島において馬の搾乳が，スマトラ島においても水牛からの搾乳が行なわれ ている。そこで，インドネシアにおいて， 1) 乳加工体 系とその特徴を把握し， 2) インドネシアにおける搾乳 技術と乳利用の起原について考察するために，インドネ シアの西ヌサ・卜ゥンガラ州のスンバワ島，スマトラ島 の西スマトラ州において， 2010 年 10 月 29 日- 2010 年 11 月 5 日まで合計 5 世帯で現地調査を行なった(Fig. 2) 。 インタビューは，通訳を介してインドネシア語で乳加工の担当者に主に行なった。[URL]...|$|R

40|$|Factors {{influencing}} udder {{health and}} prevalence of mastitis pathogens and their resistance to antimicrobials in large dairy herds in Brandenburg, Germany- a field study The {{objective of the}} field study was to 1) investigate factors influencing udder health in dairy herds in Brandenburg, Germany and 2) to describe prevalence and spreading of mastitis pathogens and their resistance patterns to antimicrobials. Eighty dairy farms were visited between July 2001 and October 2002. Data were evaluated by a standardised questionnaire for the farm manager and by an survey about milking management methods, hygiene of the milking procedure, functioning of the <b>milking</b> <b>technique,</b> udder health and environmental hygiene. The somatic cell count of all lactating cows on each farm were collected monthly by the local dairy herd improvement association (Landeskontrollverband Brandenburg) and analysed to assess udder health status. The factor {{analysis was used to}} evaluate the milking management variables, <b>milking</b> <b>technique</b> variable and environmental hygiene variables. The extracted components were analysed for their influence on somatic cell count by one way ANOVA. The oneway ANOVA and statistical tests were carried out by the logarithmic somatic cell count as dependent variable. On each herd quarter milk samples were collected from 32 clinically healthy first lactating and older cows at the beginning {{and at the end of}} lactation. In total 9910 quarter milk samples from 2529 cows were bacteriologically examined. Further a total of 314 strains of mastitis pathogens were determined for antibiotic resistance patterns by agar gel diffusion test and 325 strains were determind by broth micro dilution method. Results of both methods were compared for 146 strains. The dairy herds had an average arithmetic mean of 366. 000 somatic cells/ml and an average geometric mean of 156. 000 somatic cells/ml in the year before the month in which the farm was visited. On average of the year 42 % of the dairy cows had a somatic cell count (SCC) less than 100. 000 /ml an 64 % had a SCC less than 200. 000 /ml. This means, that the goals suggested for a healthy herd reported in the literature were not reached. As components influencing the milk somatic cell count significant water consumption and misuse (p = 0, 003), the attention of milker while milking (p = 0, 012), the acceptance of the cubicles by the cow (p = 0, 0003), the stall barn hygiene (p = 0, 008) and the hygiene of the milking area (p = 0, 022) were determined. The components milking routine, animal behaviour before and during milking, <b>milking</b> <b>technique</b> and lesions on teat ends had no influence on the average somatic cell count. Each component included several variables. In 19, 1 % of the quarter milk samples major pathogens were isolated including Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (CNS). Most prevalent pathogen isolated were CNS and Staphylococcus aureus (47, 7 % und 30, 1 %) while environmental streptococci were isolated in 9, 3 % of the samples. In comparison to the other pathogens, CNS were more often isolated in first lactating cows than in older cows. In first lactating as well as in older cows less bacteriological positiv quarters were found in early lactation compared to late lactation (first lactating cows: 19, 6 % early lactation and 27, 4 % late lactation, older cows: 23, 2 % early lactation and 33, 1 % late lactation). In first lactating cows more environmental pathogens were isolated in early lactation compared to late lactation (1, 9 % und 1, 5 %) with the exception of enterococci. In cows less environmental pathogens were found in early lactation compared to late lactation (2, 8 % and 4 %). Again with the exception of enterococci. Results of agar gel diffusion test showed that S. aureus was most susceptible to Oxacillin (98, 4 %), CNS to Cefoperazon (96, 4 %), Sc. uberis to Cloxacillin, Cefquinom and Cefoperazon (97, 7 %), Sc. dysgalactiae to Cloxacillin and Cefquinom (96, 7 %), other streptococci to Penicillin, Cloxacillin, Ampicillin and Cefquinom (87, 5 %) and Enterococci was most susceptible to Cefquinom and Ampicillin. Results of broth micro dilution method showed 100 % susceptibility of S. aureus strains to Oxacillin and Cefquinom, of Sc. uberis and Sc. dysgalactiae to Ampicilin, Cefquinom and Amoxicillin/Clavulansäure and of Enterococci to Ampicillin and Amoxicillin/Clavulansäure.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the performance of}} biocompatible organic solvents for lipid milking without cell sacrifice utilizing microalgal cells up to four cycles. Simultaneous production and extraction, is an integrated process of milking that involves cultivation of C. vulgaris {{under the influence of}} dodecane and tetradecane within the aqueous-organic biphase system and the extraction of intracellular lipids. Different concentrations (10 % v/v, 15 % v/v, and 20 % v/v) of dodecane and tetradecane were used for the extraction of lipid. The highest lipid amount (1175 ± 34 mg/L) within the solvent phase was achieved with maximum lipid recovery ratio of 47 ± 5 % during first cycle when 20 % concentration of dodecane was used as the solvent. In addition maximum cell dehydrogenase activity (4. 5 ± 0. 5 OD 492 g− 1 cell) and growth rate (1. 8 d− 1) were also observed under 20 % dodecane. The presence of higher concentration of tetradecane lowers the dehydrogenase activity thus resulting in lower lipid extraction under milking. Solvent recovery ratio was 12 % higher under 20 % dodecane as compared to 10 % of tetradecane. Growth profile study of C. vulgaris showed an overall increase in the lipid content when the cultures were extended up to four cycles.

In this study 30 high-yielding Holstein-Friesian dairy cows at different stages of lactation and free of udder infection were used. For each milk sample, the influence of <b>milk</b> sampling <b>techniques</b> was determined for the following parameters: somatic cell count, milk composition, bacterial contamination, viability, in vitro phagocytosis and overall killing of Staphylococcus aureus Newbould 305, and cellular chemiluminescence. Because milk sampling occurred throughout lactation, the differences between early, mid- and late lactation were estimated. It was concluded that bacterial contamination was not significantly different in manual milking samples and the reference technique; bacterial contamination was, however, significantly (P< 0. 001) higher in machine milking samples than in the reference technique. Among the different sampling techniques, no significant effects on SCC, milk composition, viability and functions of the cells isolated from milk were observed. It was found that viability, intracellular killing and cellular chemiluminescence of milk PMN were significantly lower (P< 0. 05) in early lactation compared to mid- lactation. Phagocytosis was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in early lactation compared to mid- and late lactation, and no significant differences were observed between mid- and late lactation.

40|$|Risk {{factors for}} the {{incidence}} rate of clinical mastitis were studied in 274 Dutch dairy herds. Variables that {{were associated with}} resistance to disease were the feeding, housing, and milking machine factors. Variables that were associated with exposure were grazing, combined housing of dry cows and heifers, and calving area hygiene. Postmilking teat disinfection in herds with a low bulk milk somatic cell count and years of practicing dry cow therapy were positively associated with the incidence rate of clinical mastitis. Herds with a low bulk milk somatic cell count and in which postmilking teat disinfection was not used had lower incidence rates of clinical mastitis than did other herds. The incidence rate of clinical mastitis caused by Escherichia coli was mostly related to housing conditions, hygiene, and machine milking. The incidence rate of clinical mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus was mostly related to factors associated with bulk milk somatic cell count and factors that {{might be due to}} cause and effect reversal. A strong positive correlation existed between the incidence rate of clinical mastitis caused by Streptococcus dysgalactiae and the incidence rate of clinical mastitis caused by Staph. aureus. The incidence rate of clinical mastitis caused by Streptococcus dysgalactiae was related to nutrition, <b>milking</b> <b>technique,</b> and machine milking. The incidence rate of clinical mastitis caused by Streptococcus uberis was associated with factors related to housing, nutrition, and machine milking.

40|$|The {{level of}} the vacuum in machine milking {{is one of the}} {{principal}} parameters which influence the integrity of the tissues and the milk quality. Many studies have shown that while raising the {{level of the}} vacuum increases the speed of milk emission, it can also generate congestion in the teat, formation of oedema, increase in residual milk and in the number of somatic cells. Thus milking should be performed with the lowest possible level of vacuum which is compatible with not excessively prolonging milking time. In Italy the vacuum level is unjustifiably high - on average 42 - 46 kPa- while in other European countries the usually level is 4 - 5 kPa lower. In order to define the <b>milking</b> <b>techniques</b> which best satisfy the physiological needs of dairy sheep, we have compared milking performances at a low vacuum level (28 kPa) and at a standard level (42 kPa). The effects of the working conditions were evaluated by analyzing the milk emission curves and the vacuum fluctuations registered in the milkline and in the short milk tube. Results showed that using a vacuum of 28 kPa increased the latency time, reduced both average and peak milk flow, and increased the average milking time per head by 17...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Animal-derived allergens include lipocalins which play an {{increasing}} role in occupational respiratory sensitizations. The prevention of sensitization in stock farming {{is often difficult}} due to intense exposure, with traditional milking still requiring close animal contact. Complete avoidance of allergen exposure is only possible if stock farming is abandoned. This is, however, often not feasible in small dairy plants because of the resulting loss of income. Case presentation In a 37 -year-old female farmer daily asthmatic complaints appeared, associated with cow dust-derived allergen exposure by milking with a conventional device. Respiratory symptoms increased {{during a period of}} 12 years. Allergic bronchial asthma was diagnosed, caused by sensitization against cow dust-derived allergens, as demonstrated by positive skin prick test and by detection of IgE antibodies. In a separate specific inhalation challenge test using a 10 % extract of cow dust-derived allergens a 330 % increase of airway resistance was detected. To enable further dairy farming, a milking robot was installed in 1999, i. e., an automatic milking system. The novel <b>milking</b> <b>technique</b> reduced the daily exposure from over 2 hours to approximately 10 min. The clinical course after the installation of the milking robot was favourable, with less frequent allergic and asthmatic symptoms. Furthermore, asthma medication could be reduced. Improvement was noted also in terms of lung-function and decreased total serum IgE. Conclusion The case presented and the evidence from the literature indicates that the strategy of exposure minimization to allergens at workplaces can be an effective alternative to total elimination. In farmers with cow dust allergy a milking robot is an appropriate technical measure to minimize allergen-exposure. </p...|$|E
40|$|Milk {{yield and}} milk {{composition}} of local (LL) and Boer (BB) goats, and their crosses (BL) were estimated over 2 kidding seasons for 12 weeks of lactation using 3 techniques, i. e. kid-suckling, hand-milking and oxytocin + hand-milking. The {{average daily gain}} (ADG) and milk conversion of kids were also determined. The total milk yield was 75. 7 ± 2. 0 kg. Milk yield in the dry and wet seasons was 84. 6 ± 3. 1 and 66. 8 ± 2. 6 kg, respectively (P< 0. 001). Estimates of milk yield by suckling and oxytocin techniques were similar. Hand milking produced 29. 9 % less milk {{than the other two}} techniques (P< 0. 001). The LL produced 70. 6 ± 2. 5, BL 81. 6 ± 2. 3 and BB 75. 0 ± 3. 8 kg milk (P< 0. 001). Milk yield increased by 14 kg/additional kid suckled, and by 17. 6 and 7. 4 kg between the first and the second and between the second and the third lactations, respectively. Mean concentrations of total solids (TS), fat and protein were 17. 4, 6. 8 and 4. 5 %, respectively. Season, technique of milk yield estimation and genotype affected milk composition. TS (%) decreased by 0. 56 /kid; increased by 0. 60 and 0. 12 between the first and the second, and between the second and the third lactations, respectively. Fat (%) decreased by 0. 76 /kid and increased by 0. 36 /lactation. The ADG from birth to 12 weeks of age was 87. 9 ± 3. 2 g. Season of kidding had a significant effect on this trait. ADG decreased by 8. 9 g/kid and increased by 19. 9 g/lactation. Milk conversion was 15. 6 kg milk/kg live-weight gain, and was affected by season, <b>milking</b> <b>technique</b> and genotype...|$|E
40|$|Udder {{health was}} studied in 300 dairy herds grouped in three {{categories}} {{according to the}} bulk milk somatic cell count. In all herds, lactating cows were housed in a free-stall barn during the winter. All herds participated in a three or four-weekly milk recording system, had annual production quota between 300, 000 and 900, 000 kg, and were stocked with cows of the Holstein-Friesian or Dutch Friesian breeds. The incidence of clinical mastitis was not different among herds with a low (< or = 150, 000), middle (151, 000 to 250, 000), or high (251, 000 to 400, 000 cells/ml) bulk milk somatic cell count. Clinical mastitis caused by Gram-negative pathogens occurred more often in herds with a low bulk milk somatic cell count. Clinical mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, or Streptococcus agalactiae occurred more often in herds with a high bulk milk somatic cell count; however, the incidence of clinical Streptococcus uberis mastitis was not different among the three herd categories. The differences in bulk milk somatic cell count between the categories {{could be explained by}} the management practices studied. The incidence of clinical E. coli mastitis was mostly related to housing, hygiene, and milking machine. The incidence of clinical Staphylococcus aureus mastitis was associated with factors that were related to the bulk milk somatic cell count and to factors of which it was not clear whether they were a cause or effect of the high incidence of Staphylococcus aureus mastitis. The incidence of clinical Streptococcus dysgalactiae mastitis was related to nutrition, <b>milking</b> <b>technique,</b> and milking machine. The incidence of clinical Streptococcus uberis mastitis was associated with housing, nutrition, and milking machine. Two groups of farmers and herds could be differentiated. The first group was identified as 'Clean and Accurate', and the second group as 'Quick and Dirty'. The relationship between these two groups and bulk milk somatic cell count category was high. However, {{the relationship between the two}} groups and the incidence of clinical mastitis was weak. LR: 20061115; PUBM: Print; JID: 0031550; ppublishSource type: Electronic(1...|$|E

50|$|Farming, {{particularly}} dairy farming, {{was once}} a primary occupation in Upper Salford. The number of dairy farmers declined as <b>milking</b> <b>techniques</b> modernized and herds became larger. Today,open space is used primarily for crop farming. Spring Mount, once called Stone Hill, was and is a recreation area for the township and the region. At {{the end of the}} 1800s, Solomon K. Grimley established an amusement a park, named after himself, on the west end of the mountain. Only a short walk from the railroad, the park included an observatory, picnic and playground facilities,dance floor for hoedowns, and areas for horseshoes and croquet. For a while it proudly displayed the clock from the former County Courthouse in Norristown. For years the Spring Mountain House was a widely known resort. The park was abandoned when it was sold in 1901. Even with the close of the park, the area continued as a popular summer destination for railroad passengers. Today, Spring Mountain is the only downhill ski area in Montgomery County. Prior to becoming a recreation area, however, the mountain was quarried on a commercial basis for its black granite rock. Many Belgian blocks cut from the quarry were hauled by the Perkiomen Railroad to Philadelphia to pave the city’s streets. The name Stone Hill died out when the quarry was abandoned around the 1920s.|$|R
