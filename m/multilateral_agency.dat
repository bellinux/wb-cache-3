The World Bank was active in Venezuela from 1961 to 1974, disbursing {{thirteen}} loans worth US$340 million. Because of its high per capita income, however, Venezuela did not become eligible for World Bank financing until 1986. In 1989 it received over US$700 million in the form of a structural adjustment loan and a trade reform loan. Venezuela also used its large and previously untapped reserves at the IMF in 1989, when the IMF disbursed the first installment of a threeyear Extended Fund Facility in the amount of US$4.8 billion. These new funds helped ease the country's painful transition to a more open economy, a transition undertaken largely on the advice of the IMF and the World Bank. Another <b>multilateral</b> <b>agency,</b> the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), also continued to fund Venezuela's development in highway construction, forestry programs, water and sanitation projects, mining, and other infrastructure projects.

Among developmental motives, recipients' needs play a significant role, together with political governance. Bilateral aid allocation is also influenced by multilateral aid flows. Among multilateral donors, the European Commission (EC) has a quite specific behaviour, with a small role played by recipients' needs and merits, and a strong bias in favour of ACP countries. Conversely, multilateral aid, excluding EC's assistance, strongly responds to recipients' needs.

40|$|Large {{international}} {{nongovernmental organizations}} (INGOs) are increasingly setting the global conservation agenda. These INGOs {{have developed a}} range of tools, e. g., Biodiversity Hot Spots (1), Global 200 Ecoregions (2), and others (3) to set priorities and to compete with each other. They often use a corporate "branding" strategy to help raise funds and to define and communicate their niches in a crowded and competitive market. This corporate model has been very successful for fundraising: Conservation International’s "Hot Spots" strategy accompanied an increase in overall annual expenditures from U. S. 27. 8 million in 1998 to U. S. 89. 3 million by 2004, and World Wildlife Fund U. S. A. 's "Ecoregions" program accompanied a rise in expenditures from U. S. 80 million to U.

40|$|This book {{provides}} the first systematic analysis of peace-building in Central Asia for inter-ethnic conflicts over water and {{land in the}} Ferghana Valley based on concrete, in-depth and on-site investigation. The core analysis centres on peace-building projects in Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan by three international aid agencies –an international NGO, a bilateral governmental donor and a <b>multilateral</b> <b>agency</b> – and the shared approach which the donors developed and used for conflict transformation. Using ethnographic case material, the author critically examines both the theoretical assumptions guiding this approach and its empirical outcomes when put into practice. Building on existing work in conflict transformation and the ethnography of international assistance in Central Asia, the book sheds light on Western attempts to transform the post-socialist societies of Central Asia and provides fresh empirical data on and insights into irrigation practices, social institutions, and state and identity formation in the Ferghana Valley. The book provides a novel and innovative approach {{to the study of}} development assistance and peace-building.

40|$|In 2006, for {{the first}} time at the International Studies Association Convention, there were three {{sessions}} on labour issues. The lack of a voice for labour in international studies is striking. Even in studies of social movements, there is a muted acknowledgement of the role of trade unions. The socio-economic security of labour makes a major contribution to overall security concerns, yet it is not widely recognised. However, there are signs that multi-lateral agencies are beginning to recognise the importance of labour standards. The International Finance Corporation recently introduced core labour standards for companies receiving its loans. An analysis of some World Bank and other <b>multilateral</b> <b>agency</b> documents shows that there are two major approaches to labour issues emerging in international policy: labour standards and workers involvement in public services. This paper analyses and reflects on a research project, which was a partnership between the International Labour Office and an international trade union, Public Services International.

The paper looks at the process of gathering and analysing data, the involvement of trade unions in this process and the responsibilities and issues that have emerged.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of trust funds at {{multilateral}} development organizations has been widely neglected in the academic literature so far. Using a simple illustrative model, this paper examines the choice by sovereign donors among various trust fund options. The authors contend that the choice among the different trust funds involves a fundamental trade-off: larger funds provide donors {{with the benefit of}} burden sharing. Conversely, each donor can better assert its individual preferences in a fund with fewer other donors. The theoretical considerations yield testable implications on a range of factors affecting this fundamental tradeoff, most notably the area of intervention of the trust fund and competing domestic interests of donor countries. Using a sample of World Bank trust funds, the paper examines the participation decisions of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development/Development Assistance Committee donors over the past decade. In line with the theoretical argument, preference homogeneity among donors as well as indicators for global activities and fragile states assistance are robust determinants of participation in (large) multi-donor funds. In contrast, donors tend to prefer single-donor trust funds in areas in which their national interests dominate. Although they could use bilateral aid for the same purpose, they often prefer to channel their contributions through trust funds at multilateral agencies. Donors thereby reduce their own administrative costs, while benefiting from the expertise of the <b>multilateral</b> <b>agency.</b> These findings confirm prior qualitative case studies and evidence from donor reports, suggesting that reduced reliance on single-donor trust funds—a costly instrument from the perspective of multilateral agencies—can improve the development effectiveness of aid...|$|E
40|$|The IMF is a {{cooperative}} membership institution with {{a fixed amount}} of money to lend. It is not a development bank with a regularly replenished pool of resources to distribute through grants or very long-term subsidized loans. The IMF lends to its members on the basis of information each country provides, and it relies on each country to pay interest and to repay principal on schedule without the possibility of recourse to bankruptcy or other judicial proceedings. Any breakdown of trust and cooperation threatens the viability of the Fund as a <b>multilateral</b> <b>agency</b> and imposes potentially large costs on all members. If one country fails to repay loans from the Fund, less money will be available for others to borrow. If a country borrows under false pretenses, the value that Fund lending adds to the global welfare could be seriously diminished. For these reasons, safeguarding the IMF’s financial resources has always been a major concern. In the 1990 s, the sanctity of the Fund’s finances suffered two threats. First, a substantial number of borrowers failed to service their debts properly. At one time or another, 18 countries had protracted arrears—financial obligations six months or more behind schedule—to the Fund. The Fund devoted considerable energies to whittling away at those arrears, adopting more-flexible and more-effective policies and applying them case by case. Some of the new policies took the form of “carrots”: posi-tive incentives to cooperate in resolving the problem. Others took the form of “sticks”: increased penalties for failing to cooperate. This potent combination, even though taking a while to work in the most difficult situations, succeeded in clearing all but two arrears cases by 2008. Second, several countries borrowed from the Fund on the basis of false information, either deliberately or through negligence. This “misreporting ” problem had never been a serious issue until this decade, so the Fund had to develop new policies and proce-dures to deal with it. Full resolution of this problem would take much longer than had the arrears problem...|$|E
