5000|$|Cowboy polo {{originated}} in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, in 1952, {{where it was}} called Palmetto Polo. The name came from the <b>mallet</b> <b>handles,</b> which were made out of palm. It was renamed [...] "cowboy polo" [...] in 1959. As it came west, it was connected almost entirely to the membership of sheriff's posses, groups primarily dedicated to mounted search and rescue, consisting of deputized law enforcement volunteers. While participation was once limited to men only, women were admitted to the sport in the mid-1990s. [...] It reached its peak of popularity during the 1970s, with clubs from Texas to Montana, as well as clubs in Australia. However, since then, cowboy polo has been in decline, with the national organization disbanding in 2005. Today, the sport is almost exclusively played in Montana. Even in Montana, where there were once 30 clubs, there are now only five.|$|R

40|$|In {{the design}} of microcalorimeters, it is often {{desirable}} to produce the X-ray absorber separately from the detector element. In this case, the attachment of the absorber to the detector element with the required thermal and mechanical characteristics is a major challenge. In such arrays, the attachment {{has been done by}} hand. This process is not easily extended to the large format arrays required for future X- ray astronomy missions such as the New x-ray Telescope or NeXT. In this paper we present an automated process for attaching absorber tiles to the surface of a large-scale X-ray detector array. The absorbers are attached with stycast epoxy to a thermally isolating polymer structure made of SU- 8. SU- 8 is a negative epoxy based photo resist produced by Microchem. We describe the fabrication of the X-ray absorbers and their suspension on a <b>handle</b> <b>die</b> in an adhesive matrix. We describe the production process for the polymer isolators on the detector elements. We have developed a new process for the alignment, and simultaneous bonding of the absorber tiles to an entire detector array. This process uses equipment and techniques used in the flip-chip bonding industry and approaches developed in the fabrication of the XRS- 2 instrument. XRS- 2 was an X-ray spectrometer that was launched on the Suzaku telescope in July 10, 2005. We describe the process and show examples of sample arrays produced by this process. Arrays with up to 300 elements have been bonded. The present tests have used dummy absorbers made of Si. In future work, we will demonstrate bonding of HgTe absorbers...|$|R

40|$|This project {{addressed}} multiple {{aspects of}} the aluminum melting and <b>handling</b> in <b>die</b> casting operations, {{with the objective of}} increasing the energy efficiency while improving the quality of the molten metal. The efficiency of melting has always {{played an important role in}} the profitability of aluminum die casting operations. Consequently, die casters need to make careful choices in selecting and operating melting equipment and procedures. The capital cost of new melting equipment with higher efficiency can sometimes be recovered relatively fast when it replaces old melting equipment with lower efficiency. Upgrades designed to improve energy efficiency of existing equipment may be well justified. Energy efficiency is however not the only factor in optimizing melting operations. Melt losses and metal quality are also very important. Selection of melting equipment has to take into consideration the specific conditions at the die casting shop such as availability of floor space, average quantity of metal used as well as the ability to supply more metal during peaks in demand. In all these cases, it is essential to make informed decisions based on the best available data...|$|R
40|$|The {{packaging}} of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) is a {{field of}} great importance to anyone using or manufacturing sensors, consumer products, or military applications. Currently much {{work has been done}} in the design and fabrication of MEMS devices but insufficient research and few publications have been completed on the packaging of these devices. This is despite the fact that packaging is a very large percentage of the total cost of MEMS devices. The main difference between IC packaging and MEMS packaging is that MEMS packaging is almost always application specific and greatly affected by its environment and packaging techniques such as <b>die</b> <b>handling,</b> <b>die</b> attach processes, and lid sealing. Many of these aspects are directly related to the materials used in the packaging processes. MEMS devices that are functional in wafer form can be rendered inoperable after packaging. MEMS <b>dies</b> must be <b>handled</b> only from the chip sides so features on the top surface are not damaged. This eliminates most current die pick-and-place fixtures. Die attach materials are key to MEMS packaging. Using hard die attach solders can create high stresses in the MEMS devices, which can affect their operation greatly. Low-stress epoxies can be high-outgassing, which can also affect device performance. Also, a low modulus die attach can allow the die to move during ultrasonic wirebonding resulting to low wirebond strength. Another source of residual stress is the lid sealing process. Most MEMS based sensors and devices require a hermetically sealed package. This can be done by parallel seam welding the package lid, but at the cost of further induced stress on the die. Another issue of MEMS packaging is the media compatibility of the packaged device. MEMS unlike ICS often interface with their environment, which could be high pressure or corrosive. The main conclusion we can draw about MEMS packaging is that the package affects the performance and reliability of the MEMS devices. There is a gross lack of understanding between the package materials, induced stress, and the device performance. The material properties of these packaging materials are not well defined or understood. Modeling of these materials and processes is far from maturity. Current post-package yields are too low for commercial feasibility, and consumer operating environment reliability and compatibility are often difficult to simulate. With further understanding of the materials properties and behavior of the packaging materials, MEMS applications can be fully realized and integrated into countless commercial and military applications...|$|R
40|$|Faulty {{activation}} of autoreactive B cells is {{a hallmark of}} autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). An important feature restricting {{activation of}} autoreactive B cells is efficient removal of apoptotic material. Mounting evidence also connects a primary defect in invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells to autoimmune disease development. However, exactly how this unconventional T cell subset is involved remains to be defined. Here, we identify a suppressive role for iNKT cells in a model where autoantibody production is triggered by an increased load of circulating apoptotic cells, resembling the situation in SLE patients. Absence or reduction of iNKT cells as well as absence of CD 1 d-expression on B cells, needed for direct iNKT–B cell interaction, leads to increased autoreactive B cell activation and symptoms of disease. The suppression mediated by the iNKT cells is observed before B cell entry into germinal centers and can be rescued by transferring iNKT cells to deficient mice. This links iNKT cells to <b>handling</b> of <b>dying</b> cells and identifies a novel peripheral tolerance checkpoint relevant for autoimmune disease. Thus, these observations connect two clinical observations in SLE patients previously considered to be unrelated and define a new target for immunotherapy...|$|R

40|$|The {{assembly}} and packaging of MEMS (Microelectromechanical Systems) devices raise {{a number of}} issues over and above those normally associated with the assembly of standard microelectronic circuits. MEMS components include a variety of sensors, microengines, optical components, and other devices.

40|$|This is an {{improved}} {{design of the}} manually operated pipe bending machine commonly used by local metal construction workers. The design ensures a smooth operation during the bending process during which the shape or length of the pipe is bent to a required angle. The bending force is provided {{by means of a}} gear assembly, powered by a 2 Horse Power electric motor. It is desired that the pipe material permanently yields under the applied force without breaking since upon removal of the force the material is not expected to recover its original shape (plastic deformation). Thus yield stress of the range of pipe thicknesses was duly considered in the design. The bending mechanism is achieved by use of a worm and flywheel gear assembly, a protractor scale for recording the angle of bend, a detachable <b>handle,</b> bend <b>dies</b> of different sizes (between 18 mm and 28 mm), bearings and flexible couplings. The machine can be used in rural areas where there is no power supply. In this case, the bending fork is disengaged from the flywheel and the detachable handle is connected to manually turn the fork. The test result shows a smooth pipe bending operation up to a pipe thickness of 2 mm. A square worm gave a relatively better result with the flywheel...|$|R
