[...] The organisation was first named the [...] "San Rafael Hose Company Number One" [...] but was then renamed the [...] "San Rafael Hose, Hook and Ladder Company" [...] to show the range of their equipment. [...] There were 45 volunteers {{from a variety of}} trades including a justice of the peace and a school superintendent and were led by sheriff James Tunstede. [...] Their first <b>major</b> <b>appliance</b> was a hose cart which was pulled by hand to a hydrant. [...] The water supply of San Rafael used gravity to provide pressure and so a pump was not required. [...] By the 1890s, the Company had 90 volunteer members, two hand pulled hose carts, two hose carriages and one hook and ladder wagon that was pulled by a rented team of horses when needed.|$|E
