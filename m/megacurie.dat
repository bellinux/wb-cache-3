40|$|This Cobalt 60 {{program is}} part of the Richland five year 02 R&D program. Topics {{discussed}} in this summary include incentives, scope and objectives, progress during report period, budget period plans, and an evaluation of progress against plans and objectives. Progress has reasonably paralleled expected results in that <b>megacurie</b> quantities of Co- 60 have been secured with activities of 20 [...] 60 curies per gram by January 1966 and 100 curies per gram by July 1967...|$|E
40|$|This Facility Effluent Monitoring Plan (FEMP) {{has been}} {{prepared}} for the 325 Building Radiochemical Processing Laboratory (RPL) at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) {{to meet the requirements}} in DOE Order 5400. 1, ''General Environmental Protection Programs. '' This FEMP has {{been prepared for}} the RPL primarily because it has a ''major'' (potential to emit > 0. 1 mrem/yr) emission point for radionuclide air emissions according to the annual National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) assessment performed. This section summarizes the airborne and liquid effluents and the inventory based NESHAP assessment for the facility. The complete monitoring plan includes characterization of effluent streams, monitoring/sampling design criteria, a description of the monitoring systems and sample analysis, and quality assurance requirements. The RPL at PNNL houses radiochemistry research, radioanalytical service, radiochemical process development, and hazardous and radioactive mixed waste treatment activities. The laboratories and specialized facilities enable work ranging from that with nonradioactive materials to work with picogram to kilogram quantities of fissionable materials and up to <b>megacurie</b> quantities of other radionuclides. The special facilities within the building include two shielded hot-cell areas that provide for process development or analytical chemistry work with highly radioactive materials and a waste treatment facility for processing hazardous, mixed radioactive, low-level radioactive, and transuranic wastes generated by PNNL activities...|$|E

Radioactive material storage and usage occur throughout the facility and include {{a large number of}} isotopes. This material is in several forms, including solid, liquid, particulate, and gas. Some of these materials are also heated during testing which can produce vapors. The research activities have been assigned to the following activity designations: High-Level Hot Cell, Hazardous Waste Treatment Unit, Waste Form Development, Special Testing Projects, Chemical Process Development, Analytical Hot Cell, and Analytical Chemistry. The following summarizes the airborne and liquid effluents and the results of the Facility Effluent Monitoring Plan (FEMP) determination for the facility.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) is {{conducting}} radioanalytical developmental programs {{with the goal}} of providing near-real-time analysis technology for airborne signature radionuclides which are indicative of a nuclear weapons test in any of the earth`s environments. If a test were conducted in the atmosphere or above the atmosphere, then the full spectrum of fission and activation products, together with residues from the device would be dispersed in the atmosphere. However, if a nuclear test were conducted underground or under water, the emission could range from a major to a very minor vent, and the material released would likely consist mainly of noble gas radionuclides and the radioiodines. Since many of the noble gases decay to form particulate radionuclides, these may serve as the more sensitive signatures. For example, Ba- 140 is a daughter of Xe- 140 (13. 6 s), and Cs- 137 is a daughter of Xe- 137 (3. 82 min). Both of these have been observed in large amounts relative to other fission products in dynamic venting of U. S. underground nuclear detonations. Large amounts of radionuclides are produced from even a comparatively small nuclear detonation. For example, a 10 -KT fission device will produce approximately a <b>megacurie</b> of Ba- 140 and of several other radionuclides with half-lives of days to weeks. If such a device were detonated in the atmosphere at midlatitude, it would easily be observable at downwind monitoring sites during its first and subsequent circumnavigations of the earth. Efficient and practical methods for the near-real-time analysis of both particulate and gaseous radionuclides are important to an effective monitoring and attribution program in support of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT); methods for this purpose are being pursued...|$|E
