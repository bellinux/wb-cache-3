50|$|Initial {{reception}} {{by critics}} was harsh, {{largely because the}} film had been hastily constructed as a low-budget montage which interleaved mainstream cinema and low-brow humour with footage which (while <b>moderate</b> <b>by</b> modern standards) {{would have been considered}} crudely pornographic in the era this movie was made.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time in 1931, with some guerrilla opposition, the Japanese conquest of Manchuria succeeded without difficulties.

5|$|Asch also {{believed}} {{the relationship between}} conformity and non-conformity was {{not as simple as}} one being the opposite of the other. This was Asch's third influential idea, and he suggested that conformity and resistance might be explained by their own unique social psychological processes. Conformity, for instance, could be a function of how aware a person is that they are being influenced by the group (distortion of perception), {{the degree to which the}} person believes that the group consensus is correct (distortion of judgement), and how badly the person wants to be accepted by the group (distortion of action). Although these exact terms have not been directly ported over to the literature, researchers such as Moscovici and Nemeth have adopted the perspective that majority and minority influence are <b>moderated</b> <b>by</b> multiple processes (Levine, 1999).|$|E
5|$|In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, 10B has a {{theoretical}} role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special {{role in the}} radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be <b>moderated</b> <b>by</b> materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons {{continue to be a}} radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.|$|E

5|$|It grows well as {{far north}} as western coast of Scotland, {{including}} the village of Plockton. It is more common in Southern England and in Ireland where it is grown all over the island. Although not a palm, it is locally named Cornish palm, Manx palm or Torbay palm. The last name is due to its extensive use in Torbay, it being the official symbol of that area, used in tourist posters promoting South Devon as the English Riviera. It also grows in Spain, Italy and Japan. Even though the natural distribution of C.australis ranges from 34Â° S to 46Â°S, and despite its ultimately tropical origins, it also grows at about five degrees from the Arctic Circle in Masfjorden, Norway, latitude 61ÂºN, in a microclimate protected from arctic winds and <b>moderated</b> <b>by</b> the Gulf Stream.|$|E

5|$|The barons {{anticipated}} that the King would act in accordance with these charters, subject to the law and <b>moderated</b> <b>by</b> {{the advice of the}} nobility.
