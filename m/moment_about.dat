2500|$|The NAACP of Portland withdrew {{its support}} of the protest, accusing the {{original}} organizers of failing to discuss discrimination affecting minority groups, specifically immigrants, Muslim women, and women of color. The group's president said she was told that those issues, along with anti-Trump and Black Lives Matter messaging and signage, were [...] "too political".

[...] Furthermore, she told Willamette Week: [...] "Putting a black woman's face {{at the beginning of the}} march doesn't fundamentally change the reason we withdrew our support.

2500|$|A line L in 3-dimensional Euclidean {{space is}} {{determined}} by two distinct points that it contains, or by two distinct planes that contain it. Consider the first case, with points x= (x1,x2,x3) and y= (y1,y2,y3). The vector displacement from x to y is nonzero because the points are distinct, and represents {{the direction of the}} line. That is, every displacement between points on L is a scalar multiple of d= y−x. If a physical particle of unit mass were to move from x to y, it would have a <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> the origin. The geometric equivalent is a vector whose direction is perpendicular to the plane containing L and the origin, and whose length equals twice the area of the triangle formed by the displacement and the origin. Treating the points as displacements from the origin, the moment is m= x×y, where [...] "×" [...] denotes the vector cross product. For a fixed line, L, the area of the triangle is proportional to the length of the segment between x and y, considered as the base of the triangle; it is not changed by sliding the base along the line, parallel to itself. By definition the moment vector is perpendicular to every displacement along the line, so d•m= 0, where [...] "•" [...] denotes the vector dot product.|$|E
