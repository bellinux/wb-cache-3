5|$|A {{homophonic}} texture may be homorhythmic, {{which means}} that all parts have the same rhythm. Chorale texture is another variant of homophony. The <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> homophony is melody-dominated homophony, in which one voice, often the highest, plays a distinct melody, and the accompanying voices work together to articulate an underlying harmony.|$|E
5|$|Atrophic acne scars {{have lost}} {{collagen}} from the healing response {{and are the}} <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> acne scar (account for approximately 75% of all acne scars). They may be further classified as ice-pick scars, boxcar scars, and rolling scars. Ice-pick scars are narrow (less than 2mm across), deep scars that extend into the dermis. Boxcar scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary in size from 1.5–4mm across. Rolling scars are wider than icepick and boxcar scars (4–5mm across) and have a wave-like pattern of depth in the skin.|$|E

5|$|Both {{of these}} discoveries—the space {{weathering}} effects {{and the low}} density—led to a new understanding {{about the relationship between}} S-type asteroids and OC meteorites. S-types are the most numerous kind of asteroid in the inner part of the asteroid belt. OC meteorites are, likewise, the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> meteorite found on the Earth's surface. The reflection spectra measured by remote observations of S-type asteroids, however, did not match that of OC meteorites. The Galileo flyby of Ida found that some S-types, particularly the Koronis family, could be the source of these meteorites.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning {{is relatively}} common, resulting {{in more than}} 20,000 emergency room visits {{a year in the}} United States. It is the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> fatal poisoning in many countries. In the United States non-fire related cases results in more than 400 deaths a year. Poisonings occur more often in the winter, particularly from the use of portable generators during power outages. The toxic effects of CO have been known since ancient history. The realization that hemoglobin was affected by CO was determined in 1857.|$|E
5|$|In September 2009, the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> microbe on {{the surface}} of Lake Chillisquaque was Oscillatoria, which made up {{approximately}} 75 percent of the total. Raphidiopsis was the second most common type, making up approximately 15 percent of the total. In May 2010, approximately 40 percent of the microbes were Navicula and 35 percent were Oscillatoria. Slightly less than 10 percent of the microbes are Anabaena. In July 2010, Oscillatoria and Synechococcus each made up approximately 25 percent of the microbes and between 10 and 15 percent were Anabaena.|$|E

The decision upon a general-security women's corrective labor colony (the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> prison in Russia) in the Republic of Mordovia, approximately 400 kilometers from Moscow, was later confirmed by Tolokonnikova's husband. The women asked authorities to let them serve their sentence at the pre-trial detention facility in Moscow. Their request was denied, and Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina were then dispatched to penal colonies in Mordovia and Perm Oblast, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Manitoba's economy {{relies heavily}} on agriculture, tourism, energy, oil, mining, and forestry. Agriculture is vital and is found mostly in the {{southern}} half of the province, although grain farming occurs {{as far north as}} The Pas. Around 12 percent of Canadian farmland is in Manitoba. The <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> farm found in rural areas is cattle farming (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%).|$|E
5|$|Post-fermented tea: Teas {{that are}} allowed to undergo a second {{oxidation}} after the fixation of the tea leaves, such as Pu-erh, Liu'an, and Liubao, are collectively referred to as secondary or post-fermentation teas in English. In Chinese they are categorized as Dark tea or black tea. This {{is not to be}} confused with the English term Black tea, known in Chinese as red tea. Pu-erh, also known as Póu léi (Polee) in Cantonese is the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> post-fermentation tea in the market.|$|E

5|$|Sheep {{have had}} a strong {{presence}} in many cultures, especially in areas where they form the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> livestock. In the English language, to call someone a sheep or ovine may allude that they are timid and easily led. In contradiction to this image, male sheep are often used as symbols of virility and power; the logos of the Los Angeles Rams football team and the Dodge Ram pickup truck allude to males of the bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis.|$|E
5|$|Standardized system: Boots and {{bindings}} have {{an integrated}} connection, typically a bar {{across the front}} end of the sole of the boot, and platform on which the boot rests. Two families of standards prevail: NNN (New Nordic Norm) and SNS (Salomon Nordic System) Profil. Both systems have variants for skiing on groomed surfaces and in back country. These systems are the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> binding.|$|E

Ceramic architectural models of buildings, like houses and towers, were found in Han tombs, perhaps to provide lodging for the dead in the afterlife.

The artistic designs found on ceramic roof tiles of tower models are in some cases exact matches to Han roof tiles found at archaeological sites.|$|E

The second <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> electrode holder is semiautomatic water-cooled, where {{the only difference is}} that water takes the place of air. It uses higher current levels for welding T or corner joints. The third typical holder type is a water cooled automatic electrode holder—which is typically used with automated equipment.|$|E
