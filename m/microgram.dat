40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} an epidural single dose of neostigmine combined with sufentanil to provide selective and balanced analgesia {{at the beginning of}} labor. METHODS: After informed consent, 125 healthy parturients were randomly allocated to receive, after a test dose, a single injection of either epidural sufentanil 20 <b>micrograms</b> (minimal analgesic dose) or 10 <b>micrograms</b> or a combination of sufentanil 10 <b>micrograms</b> with neostigmine 250, 500, or 750 <b>micrograms</b> in a total volume of 12 ml. Pain scores were recorded at regular intervals to determine onset and duration of analgesia. Maternal and fetal vital parameters as well as side effects were closely monitored. RESULTS: Parturients did not differ concerning demographic data. Epidural neostigmine 500 <b>micrograms</b> with sufentanil 10 <b>micrograms</b> produced effective analgesia (visual analog scale < 30 mm within 10 min in 72 % parturients and within 15 min in 85 % parturients; average duration of 119 min, confidence interval 96 - 142 min) that was as effective as epidural sufentanil 20 <b>micrograms.</b> Epidural combination with neostigmine 250 <b>micrograms</b> was ineffective, whereas 750 <b>micrograms</b> did not produce higher effect than 500 <b>micrograms.</b> No motor block was recorded. Maternal and fetal vital parameters remained stable during labor. CONCLUSIONS: Epidural combination of neostigmine 500 <b>micrograms</b> (e. g., 6 - 7 micrograms/kg) with sufentanil 10 <b>micrograms</b> provides similar duration of analgesia as epidural sufentanil 20 <b>micrograms</b> and allows effective and selective analgesia devoid of side effects in the first stage of labor...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Formoterol, a new beta 2 agonist, is {{long and}} fast acting when given as an aerosol. The aim was to {{determine}} the onset and duration of bronchodilatation with formoterol as a dry powder compared with salbutamol dry powder and with placebo. METHODS [...] Fifteen patients with stable asthma with a reversibility of 15 % or more participated in a double blind, within patient study. On five different days the patients received formoterol 6 <b>micrograms,</b> 12 <b>micrograms,</b> or 24 <b>micrograms,</b> salbutamol 400 <b>micrograms,</b> or placebo in random order. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) was measured 10 minutes before, 30 minutes after, and then every hour for up to 12 hours after treatment. Specific airway resistance (sRaw) and specific airway conductance (sGaw) were measured immediately before and one, three, five, 10, 15, and 30 minutes after treatment. RESULTS [...] Formoterol 12 <b>micrograms</b> and 24 <b>micrograms</b> caused bronchodilatation as rapidly as salbutamol 400 <b>micrograms.</b> Peak values were not significantly different in the active treatments. The duration of action, calculated as median time with 20 % or more of the maximum achieved increase in FEV 1, was sustained for 9 hours and 16 minutes with salbutamol 400 <b>micrograms,</b> for 9 hours and 45 minutes with formoterol 6 <b>micrograms,</b> for 11 hours and 22 minutes with formoterol 12 <b>micrograms,</b> and for 11 hours and 42 minutes with formoterol 24 <b>micrograms.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] Formoterol as a dry powder at doses of 12 <b>micrograms</b> and 24 <b>micrograms</b> produces a rapid onset of action and has a bronchodilator effect comparable with salbutamol 400 <b>micrograms</b> as a dry powder. The bronchodilatation was sustained for 11 - 12 hours. Formoterol 6 <b>micrograms</b> caused similar bronchodilatation but more slowly and for a shorter time...|$|R

It has been used in educational applications since 1969 when the Georgia Institute of Technology received a loan of 119µg of californium-252 from the Savannah River Plant.

5|$|The CM Division was {{responsible}} for the purification and fabrication of materials for the bomb, including the core, tamper and initiator. The chemistry and metallurgy of uranium was fairly well known, although it did yield a few surprises, but that of plutonium was almost completely unknown. The element had only been discovered a short time before, and existed only in <b>microgram</b> amounts. Educated guesses about its chemistry tended to be wrong, and as research progressed it was found to have unusual properties, including no less than six allotropes. There was rivalry between its discoverers, with Wahl and Kennedy's group at Los Alamos competing with Seaborg's in Chicago to produce the best process for purifying the metal. This competition ended abruptly when Segrè's group at Los Alamos discovered that high levels of a hitherto undiscovered plutonium-240 isotope in reactor-produced plutonium meant that an implosion-type nuclear weapon was required, and a high degree of purity was therefore unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} {{americium}} {{in a typical}} new smoke detector is 1microcurie (37kBq) or 0.29 <b>microgram.</b> This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium-237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an ionization chamber, an air-filled space between two electrodes, and permits a small, constant current between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which {{are too small to}} produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms.|$|E

Typically, the most commonly used isotope 256Md is produced by bombarding either einsteinium-253 or -254 with alpha particles: einsteinium-254 is preferred when available because it has a longer half-life and therefore {{can be used as a}} target for longer.
