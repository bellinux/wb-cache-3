5000|$|A September 13, 2008, Wall Street Journal {{editorial}} {{prior to}} the election written by Phil Gramm, former Republican Senator and campaign economic adviser to John McCain, and Mike Solon, former Policy Director under the George W. Bush Administration, suggested that looking at the Senators' respective states proved traditional Republican strategies, enacted by McCain, {{would be better for}} the economy than traditional Democratic strategies, enacted by Obama, arguing [...] "Mr. Obama would stimulate the economy by increasing federal spending. <b>Mr.</b> <b>McCain</b> would stimulate the economy by cutting the corporate tax rate." [...] Gramm had introduced the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which editors of the same paper, The Wall Street Journal, pointed out in a March 10, 2009, article had been blamed for deregulating major corporations and [...] "allowed for the creation of giant financial supermarkets that could own investment banks, commercial banks and insurance firms, something banned since the Great Depression. Its passage, critics say, cleared the way for companies that were too big and intertwined to fail." [...] That month, September 2008, would see record drops in the Dow, including a 778-point drop to 10,365.45 that was the worst since Black Monday of the 1987 stock market crash and was followed by a loss of thousands of points over the next two months, standing at 8,046 on November 17 and including a 9% plunge in the S&P on December 1, 2008.|$|E

40|$|It {{might seem}} an {{unlikely}} {{place to go}} for advice, but the US disclosure system is more transparent and much more timely than Australia’s, writes BRIAN COSTAR on our partner website, Inside Story IN the New York Times this week journalists Michael Luo and Griff Palmer gave us an insight into the fundraising feats of Barack Obama and John McCain {{as we head into}} the last few weeks of the presidential campaign. All the wonder, of course, has been at the huge sums that Senator Obama has been able to raise over the internet from small donors. What Luo and Griff point out, however, is that both candidates are receiving healthy amounts of cash in large donations. The most generous donors to both sides come from within the securities and investment industries. (Haven’t they just gone bust?) Senator McCain gets {{most of the rest of}} his war chest from the real estate and gas and fuel industries, whereas Obama does best from lawyers, retirees and the entertainment industry. “Gordon V. Smith, a Maryland home builder, and his wife, Helen, gave $ 67, 800 each to <b>Mr</b> <b>McCain</b> this year and attended a fund-raiser at the Ritz-Carlton in Tysons Corner,” report Luo and Palmer. “A dozen employees at Goldman Sachs wrote checks of $ 25, 000 or more to Mr Obama. ” [...] .

40|$|The {{topic of}} this essay {{is the way in}} which {{strategies}} of persuasion in political speeches can be used to impose certain moral or ethical values on people. The aim of the study is to elucidate implicit statements in the language of politics seeing that political speeches are not primarily prosperous because they are correct or true, instead, it may be more dependent on how valid the arguments seem. Two speeches during the American presidential campaign of 2008 are analyzed: one speech by the Democratic president candidate Mr. Barack Obama and one by the Republican candidate <b>Mr.</b> John <b>McCain.</b> The audience is American military veterans and the speeches concern the American forces in Iraq. The method of analysis was to locate expressions where linguistic choices seem to have been made in order to convey certain views. The following rhetorical strategies were analyzed: metaphors, metonymies, analogies, pronouns, the active or passive voice of transitive verbs, sound-bites, three-part lists and contrastive pairs. It is argued in this essay that both speakers use rhetorical strategies to convey their ideas of morality and their views of the war in Iraq. McCain’s main argument is that the war in Iraq is right and should continue while Obama argues that the war in Iraq is wrong. However, war in itself is not wrong, hence the right war ought to be fought somewhere else according to Obama. The conclusion to be drawn from this study is that it is important to be aware of how politicians use rhetorical strategies in order to convince an audience of the rectitude of war.
