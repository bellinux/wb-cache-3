Gilpin was awarded the New South Wales Police Commendation (courage) for his part in protecting a member of the community who was being subjected to <b>mob</b> <b>justice.</b> He placed his body in front of the mob, who were armed with machettes and other weapons and managed to extract the victim to safety.|$|E
500|$|There {{were five}} lynchings in South Carolina during Tillman's first term, and {{thirteen}} during his second. Tillman {{had to walk}} a narrow line in the debates over lynching, since most of his supporters believed in the collective right of white men in a community to dispense <b>mob</b> <b>justice,</b> especially in cases of alleged rape. Yet as governor, he was sworn to uphold the rule of law. He attempted to finesse the matter by seeking to appeal to both sides, demanding that the law be followed, but that he would, as he stated in 1892, [...] "willingly lead a mob in lynching a Negro who had committed an assault on a white woman". Under criticism, he amended this to a willingness to lead the lynching of [...] "a man of any color who assaults a virtuous woman of any color"—the adjective [...] "virtuous" [...] limiting the commitment, in Tillman's view, to assaults on white women.|$|E

They were influenced by the counterinsurgency tactics developed by the United States through its famous School of the Americas. This, of course, was opposed to the vision that the farmers had of themselves, as a demobilized Communist self-defense and guerrilla force, refugees from the government of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, working in a peaceful community.

40|$|Overborne by a <b>mob</b> mentality for <b>justice,</b> {{officials}} {{at every level}} of government are enacting laws that effectively exile convicted sex offenders from their midst with little contemplation as to the appropriateness or constitutionality of their actions. These laws fundamentally alter the liberties and freedom of convicted sex offenders to satisfy the ignorant fear of the masses. As a result, residence and employment restrictions which in theory are to protect society, in practice only exacerbate the perceived recidivism problem. When such laws are passed and the political process is broken, it is necessary for the judicial branch to step forward and protect those who are politically impotent...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the subject}} of {{education}} the authors declared that not only should it be made free, it should be made compulsory. Higher education, they declared, should be governed independently of class or race, and they demanded {{action to be taken}} to improve [...] "high school facilities". This they emphasized: [...] "either the United States will destroy ignorance, or ignorance will destroy the United States". [...] The document also demanded that judges be selected independently of their race, and that the criminals, white or black, should be given equal punishments for their respective crimes. In his address to the nation, W. E. B. Du Bois stated, [...] "We are not more lawless than the white race; we are more often arrested, convicted and <b>mobbed.</b> We want <b>justice,</b> even for criminals and outlaws." [...] He called for the outright abolition of the convict lease system. In this system, during times when there wasn't enough space in the prisons, convicts were leased out to work as cheap laborers for [...] "railway contractors, mining companies and those who farm large plantations".

5000|$|Author Lynda Schuster writes, [...] 'Necklacing' {{represented}} {{the worst of}} the excesses committed {{in the name of the}} uprising. This was a particularly gruesome form of <b>mob</b> <b>justice,</b> reserved for those thought to be government collaborators, informers and black policemen. The executioners would force a car tire over the head and around the arms of the suspect, drench it in petrol, and set it alight. Immobilized, the victim burned to death.|$|E

50|$|Inefficiency, incompetence, delayed salary payments, {{and a lack}} of {{resources}} are all major judicial problems. With only 38 courthouses and 124 magistrates in the country, many citizens lack easy access to the civil judicial system, as a result of which traditional family and village courts continue to play a major role. The inefficiency of courts also leads people to take the law into their own hands, holding local tribunals, appealing to local chiefs, and engaging in <b>mob</b> <b>justice,</b> especially in cases involving persons accused of witchcraft.|$|E
50|$|General Sherman also {{determined}} {{that there would}} be no lynching, or <b>mob</b> <b>justice,</b> involving the Indian Chiefs, but made clear his determination to see them convicted in a civil court. In a letter to Colonel MacKenzie, dated May 28, 1871, General Sherman said:They must not be mobbed or lynched but tried regularly for murder and as many other crimes as the Attorney can approve; but the military authorities should see that these prisoners never escape alive, for they are the very impersonation of Murder, robbery, arson, and all the capital crimes of the Statute Book.|$|E
5000|$|Before 1861, Denver was {{technically}} part of Arapahoe County, Kansas.

50|$|The purge after World War II {{has been}} widely debated, {{partially}} because small offences were sentenced quicker and generally more severely than trials for greater offences which lasted longer, while moods were cooling down {{after the end of}} the war. Another point of critique was the retroactivity of the law. Contrarily, proponents in the 1945 debate argued that if the death penalty was not re-applied, war criminals would be subject to <b>mob</b> <b>justice</b> or lynchings. According to a 1945 opinion poll, about 90 percent of the population were in favour of death penalty for certain war criminals.|$|E
50|$|Bokii's {{moderation}} {{with respect}} to the use of terror brought him into conflict with Zinoviev, who in mid-September 1918 was advancing the idea of distributing arms to the Petrograd workers and allowing them to administer <b>mob</b> <b>justice</b> against their perceived class enemies as they saw fit. Stasova seems to have felt that her ally Bokii was in physical danger if he remained in Petrograd without protection and she appealed to Yakov Sverdlov for his transfer to Moscow, outside of Zinoviev's fief. According to a biography of Bokii published {{in the last years of}} the Soviet Union, Bokii was successfully removed as head of the Petrograd Cheka by Zinoviev by the end of that month.|$|E
50|$|The Acholi {{system of}} justice is complex and often more violent than this {{forgiveness}} ceremony would suggest. People caught committing a crime, such as stealing or murder, often face <b>mob</b> <b>justice</b> and usually end up dead if the police do not arrive fast enough. While this seems like a contradiction from the above description, it is consistent within the community because what really matters is that the offender must ask for forgiveness of their own volition, and not be induced {{to do so by}} a fear for their life. Only if the community is satisfied that the offense will never be committed again is the person allowed to ask for mato oput.|$|E
5000|$|John Murphy criticized Farrell's approach, {{noting that}} by {{accepting}} the confessions as the baseline truth and hewing to the [...] "conventional" [...] history {{that led to}} <b>mob</b> <b>justice,</b> Farrell had invented conversations and created motivations that were impossible to corroborate and glossed over inconsistencies. Murphy points out the later phone calls placed to make ransom demands came from payphones physically close together, culminating in the arrest of Thurmond at a payphone only 150 ft from San Jose Police Headquarters. Murphy {{would go on to}} write a book, Jury Rigging in the Court of Public Opinion (published in 2007), and write and produce a movie, Valley of the Hearts Delight regarding the 1933 case.|$|E

5000|$|Humiliating of {{one person}} by another (the humiliator) is often used {{as a way of}} asserting power over them, and is a common form of oppression or abuse used in a police, military, or prison context during legal interrogations or illegal torture sessions. Many now-obsolete public punishments were {{deliberately}} designed to be humiliating, e.g. tarring and feathering lawbreakers, pillory, [...] "mark of shame" [...] (stigma) as a means of [...] "making an example" [...] of a person and presenting a deterrent to others. Some practices, such as tarring and feathering, became tools of unofficial <b>mob</b> <b>justice.</b> In folk customs such as the English skimmington rides and rough music (and their continental equivalents, such as the French Charivari), dramatic public demonstrations of moral disapproval were enacted to humiliate transgressors and drive them out of the community.|$|E
5000|$|The term outlawry {{referred}} to the formal procedure of declaring someone an outlaw, i.e. putting him outside of the sphere of legal protection.
