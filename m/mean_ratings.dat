50|$|When {{ratings of}} the figures' {{attractiveness}} were made, generally it appeared that bust size, WHR, and their weight were all important contributory elements. The female participants rated the figures with a low WHR as more attractive, healthy, feminine looking, {{and in the case}} of the heavy figure, more kind/understanding than did male participants. This is a particularly interesting finding, as most previous studies report that young women idealize female bodies solely on the basis of thinness. As far as the breast sizes of the slender figures is concerned, whether they had large or small breasts did not appear to have any effect on the ratings of attractiveness or kindness/understanding, and having larger breasts only increased the <b>mean</b> <b>ratings</b> of health and femininity very slightly. However, a heavy figure with a high WHR and a large bust was rated as the least attractive and healthy by all participants.|$|E
50|$|Consensus-based {{assessment}} {{is based on}} a simple finding: that samples of individuals with differing competence (e.g., experts and apprentices) rate relevant scenarios, using Likert scales, with similar <b>mean</b> <b>ratings.</b> Thus, {{from the perspective of a}} CBA framework, cultural standards for scoring keys can be derived from the population that is being assessed. Peter Legree and Joseph Psotka, working together over the past decades, proposed that psychometric g could be measured unobtrusively through survey-like scales requiring judgments. This could either use the deviation score for each person from the group or expert mean; or a Pearson correlation between their judgments and the group mean. The two techniques are perfectly correlated. Legree and Psotka subsequently created scales that requested individuals to estimate word frequency; judge binary probabilities of good continuation; identify knowledge implications; and approximate employment distributions. The items were carefully identified to avoid objective referents, and therefore the scales required respondents to provide judgments that were scored against broadly developed, consensual standards. Performance on this judgment battery correlated approximately 0.80 with conventional measures of psychometric g. The response keys were consensually derived. Unlike mathematics or physics questions, the selection of items, scenarios, and options to assess psychometric g were guided roughly by a theory that emphasized complex judgment, but the explicit keys were unknown until the assessments had been made: they were determined by the average of everyone's responses, using deviation scores, correlations, or factor scores.|$|E

The SET literature suggests that class size is a negative systematic influence on SET ratings. In this paper we investigate time-series SET data from a large first-year engineering class where a decline in SET ratings was observed over time as course enrolment increased. We observe a negative halo effect of increasing class size on <b>mean</b> SET <b>ratings</b> and conclude that increasing course enrolment leads to a significant reduction in all <b>mean</b> SET <b>ratings,</b> even when the course learning design remains essentially unchanged. We also find an additional differential effect of increasing course enrolment on <b>mean</b> SET <b>ratings.</b> We observe that the marginal reduction in <b>mean</b> SET <b>ratings</b> for each additional student in the course enrolment is greater for those aspects of the student learning experience that are likely to be most directly impacted by increasing class size.

40|$|The primary aim of {{the study}} was to perform a {{comparative}} analysis of the positional training loads during various game formats among European professional soccer players. Twenty-two male professional soccer players participated in the investigation and were divided into their tactical positional roles for analysis. Ratings of perceived exertion were collected daily and corresponded to specific formatted game types (small-sided games; large-sided games; large-sided games within a smaller area size) implemented as part of the weekly periodised training structure. Across the sample period, only one game per week training scenarios were analysed (9 small-sided games; 9 large-sided games; 9 large-sided games within a smaller area size). Analysis of the <b>mean</b> <b>ratings</b> of perceived exertion between various game formats revealed significant differences between large-sided games within a smaller area size vs. small-sided games (5. 53 vs. 7. 79; p ¼ 0. 007); however, no differences were presented between small-sided games vs. large-sided games format types (7. 9 vs. 7. 35; p > 0. 05). No differences between <b>mean</b> <b>ratings</b> of perceived exertion and small-sided games and large-sided games, respectively, were found. Differences were shown between positional demands during large-sided games within a smaller area size game type formats, with wide forwards reporting higher <b>mean</b> <b>ratings</b> of perceived exertion values when compared against centre forwards (p ¼ 0. 02). Therefore, within a periodised microcycle, variance of game formats can be used to manipulate training loads, manage accumulation of fatigue through a tapering method in order to facilitate optimal match preparation. Furthermore, players of certain position types may require additional training stimulus to induce the desired physical adaptations. ...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a practitioner-validated list of computer competencies for use in the training of preservice elementary teachers. The review of literature identified 22 computer competencies which educational writers believed elementary teachers should be expected to possess in order to integrate computers into their classroom instruction. Computer-using educators in a large urban and suburban area were given a survey that presented a list of those competencies. These educators were asked to use a Likert-type scale to rate the derived competencies according to the importance they thought the competencies had for future teachers and to rate their perceptions of their own abilities in the same competencies. Factor analysis showed that the responses to the survey grouped the computer competencies into three categories: Computer Literacy, Computer-Assisted Instruction, and Use of Application Software. Analysis of the <b>mean</b> <b>ratings</b> given by all the respondents to the competencies showed that the skills relating to the use of computer-assisted instructional materials (CAI) were most important when considering the skills for preservice elementary teachers. Respondents rated the ability to judge the appropriateness of CAI materials, the ability to judge the effectiveness of CAI materials, and the quality of instructional software as the three most important skills for future teachers. When considering their own proficiency in the same competencies, the respondents' <b>mean</b> <b>ratings</b> indicated that skills dealing with the use of CAI materials were the ones they were most confident about. A Spearman Correlation between Parts II & III of the survey showed that there was a correlation between what the respondents thought was important for future teachers and the skills teachers considered themselves as possessing. <b>Mean</b> <b>ratings</b> also showed that the respondents rated the same skills as important for future teachers that they themselves possessed.
