5|$|In astronomy, constellations {{named after}} {{arthropods}} include the zodiacal Scorpius, the scorpion, and <b>Musca,</b> the fly, {{also known as}} Apis, the bee, in the deep southern sky. <b>Musca,</b> the only recognised insect constellation, was named by Petrus Plancius in 1597.|$|E
5|$|The French {{explorer}} and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille {{called it}} la Mouche on the 1756 {{version of his}} planisphere of the southern skies. Jean Fortin retained the French name in 1776 for his Atlas Céleste, while Lacaille Latinised the name for his revised Coelum Australe Stelliferum in 1763. Lacaille renamed it to <b>Musca</b> Australis, the Southern Fly—Australis, since it counterparted the now discarded constellation of <b>Musca</b> Borealis composed of a few stars in Aries, and to avoid confusion with Apus. Today the name is simply <b>Musca.</b> It is the only official constellation depicting an insect.|$|E
5|$|Dung beetles (Scarabidae) {{have been}} {{successfully}} used to reduce the populations of pestilent flies, such as <b>Musca</b> vetustissima and Haematobia exigua which are serious pests of cattle in Australia. The beetles make the dung unavailable to breeding pests by quickly rolling and burying it in the soil, with the added effect of improving soil fertility, tilth, and nutrient cycling. The Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985), introduced species of dung beetle to Australia from South Africa and Europe to reduce populations of <b>Musca</b> vetustissima, following successful trials of this technique in Hawaii. The American Institute of Biological Sciences reports that dung beetles save the United States cattle industry an estimated US$380 million annually through burying above-ground livestock feces.|$|E

50|$|To small telescopes, Theta <b>Muscae</b> {{appears as}} a double star, with a blue-cream {{brighter}} star and an O9III companion of magnitude 7.3 some 5.3 arcseconds away. The primary θ <b>Muscae</b> A is a massive triple star system.|$|R
50|$|Delta <b>Muscae</b> has a listed {{spectral}} type of K2III. The K2 {{portion of}} this designation specifies that Delta <b>Muscae</b> A is a class K2 star, meaning the light it emits is orange in color. The main star burns at a temperature cooler than the Sun, which is a G2 star. The {{second part of the}} classification, III, specifies that Delta <b>Muscae</b> is a giant star which has already left the main sequence of star life like the Sun.|$|R
5|$|A test in 1997 {{showed that}} P. fimbriata′s {{preferences}} for {{different types of}} prey are in the order: web spiders; jumping spiders; and insects. These preferences apply to both live prey and motionless lures, and to P. fimbriata specimens without prey for 7days ("well-fed") and without prey for 14days ("starved"). P. fimbriata specimens without prey for 21days ("extra-starved") showed no preference for different types of prey. The test included as prey several species of web spiders and jumping spiders, and {{the selection of the}} prey species showed no evidence of affecting the results. Insects were represented by the house fly <b>Musca</b> domestica.|$|E
5|$|The Australian bush fly, <b>Musca</b> vetustissima, {{is a major}} {{nuisance}} pest in Australia, but native decomposers {{found in}} Australia are not adapted to feeding on cow dung, which is where bush flies breed. Therefore, the Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985), led by George Bornemissza of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, released forty-nine species of dung beetle, {{to reduce the amount}} of dung and therefore also the potential breeding sites of the fly.|$|E
5|$|The locust {{is large}} and easy to breed and rear, and is used as an {{experimental}} model in research studies. It {{has been used in}} evolutionary biology research and to discover to what degree conclusions reached about other organisms, such as the fruit fly (Drosophila) and the housefly (<b>Musca),</b> are applicable to all insects. It is a suitable school laboratory animal because of its robustness and the ease with which it can be grown and handled.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{research}} {{done by the}} European Space Agency for the Hipparcos Star Catalogue, Delta <b>Muscae</b> exhibits a parallax of 35.91 milliarcseconds.

5|$|The {{stars that}} {{correspond}} to Grus were generally too far south to be seen from China. In Chinese astronomy, Gamma and Lambda Gruis may {{have been included in}} the tub-shaped asterism Bàijiù, along with stars from Piscis Austrinus. In Central Australia, the Arrernte and Luritja people living on a mission in Hermannsburg viewed the sky as divided between them, east of the Milky Way representing Arrernte camps and west denoting Luritja camps. Alpha and Beta Gruis, along with Fomalhaut, Alpha Pavonis and the stars of <b>Musca,</b> were all claimed by the Arrernte.|$|E
5|$|The {{thoracic}} segments {{have one}} ganglion on each side, which are connected into a pair, one pair per segment. This arrangement is also {{seen in the}} abdomen {{but only in the}} first eight segments. Many species of insects have reduced numbers of ganglia due to fusion or reduction. Some cockroaches have just six ganglia in the abdomen, whereas the wasp Vespa crabro has only two in the thorax and three in the abdomen. Some insects, like the house fly <b>Musca</b> domestica, have all the body ganglia fused into a single large thoracic ganglion.|$|E
5|$|A test in 1997 {{showed that}} P. labiata from the Philippines and from Sri Lanka have similar {{preferences}} for {{different types of}} prey, and that the order of preference is: web spiders; jumping spiders; and insects.

50|$|The gamma-ray and X-ray source GRS 1124-683, {{discovered}} by the Granat mission and Ginga, is a system containing a black hole candidate. The system also {{goes by the name}} X-ray Nova <b>Muscae</b> 1991 or GU <b>Muscae.</b> These two orbiting X-ray telescopes discovered the system when the system produced an outburst of X-rays on January 9, 1991.|$|R
5|$|Also {{known as}} Nova <b>Muscae</b> 1983, GQ <b>Muscae</b> is a binary system {{consisting}} of a white dwarf and small star that is about 10% as massive as the Sun. The two orbit each other every 1.4hours. The white dwarf accumulates material from its companion star via its accretion disc. After a certain amount has accumulated the star erupts, {{as it did in}} 1983, reaching a magnitude of 7.2. Discovered with a magnitude of 7.1 on 18 January 1983, it was the first nova from which X-rays were detected. The soft X-ray transient GRS 1124-683 (also known as Nova <b>Muscae</b> 1991) is a binary object {{consisting of a}}n orange main-sequence star (GU <b>Muscae)</b> of spectral type K3V–K4V and a black hole of around 6 solar masses. During the 1991 outburst which led to its discovery, radiation was produced through a process of positron annihilation. GR <b>Muscae</b> is an X-ray source composed of a neutron star of between 1.2 and 1.8 times the mass of our Sun and a low-mass star likely to be around the mass of the Sun in close orbit. Finally, SY <b>Muscae</b> is a symbiotic star system composed of a red giant and white dwarf, where although the larger star is transferring mass to the smaller, there is no periodic eruption nor accretion disc formed. The star system varies in magnitude from 10.2 to 12.7 over a period of 624.5 days.|$|R
5|$|Lacaille charted and {{designated}} ten {{stars with}} the Bayer designations Alpha through to Kappa in 1756. He catalogued stars that became Lambda and Mu {{but did not}} designate them as he considered them informes as they lay outside the asterism proper. Baily considered them part of <b>Musca,</b> and Gould gave them their Bayer designations. Francis Baily also dropped Kappa, which he felt was too faint to warrant a name, and designated two adjacent stars as Zeta1 and Zeta2. These last two stars are 1° apart, quite far to be sharing a Bayer designation. Lacaille had originally labelled the fainter one as Zeta, while Baily presupposed he'd meant to label the brighter one. Reluctant to remove Lacaille's designation, he gave them both the Zeta designation. Altogether there are 62 stars brighter than magnitude 6.5 in the constellation.|$|E
5|$|Located on {{the border}} with Circinus is the unusual {{planetary}} nebula NGC 5189, estimated to be around 1750light-years away from Earth. Its complex structure is due to multiple ejections of material from the ageing central star, which are distorted by the presence of a likely binary companion. Located 2.4° east of Eta Muscae is the magnitude-12.9 Engraved Hourglass Nebula (MyCn18), which lies about 8000 light-years distant from Earth. To Eta's west lies IC 4191, a compact bluish planetary nebula of magnitude 10.6, thought to lie around 10,750 light-years away from Earth. West of Epsilon Muscae is NGC 4071, a large, diffuse planetary nebula of magnitude 12.7 with a magnitude 12 central star, thought to lie around 4000 light-years away from Earth. The Coalsack Nebula is a dark nebula located mainly in neighbouring Crux that intrudes into <b>Musca.</b> NGC 4463 is an open cluster located on its southwestern border. Around five light-years across, it is located around 3400 light-years away.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} ants that use scent to forage for food, jack jumpers use their sight to target their prey. Like other bull ants, they are solitary when they forage, but only workers perform this role. These ants are omnivores and scavengers, {{typically}} foraging in warmer temperatures. They deliver painful stings, which {{are effective in}} both killing prey and deterring predators. Jack jumpers have smooth stingers, and can thus sting indefinitely. Jack jumper ants are skilled hunters, partially due to their excellent vision; they can even kill and devour wasps and bees. They also kill and eat other ants, such as carpenter ants (Camponotus) and feed on sweet floral secretions and other sugar solutions. Jack jumpers often hunt for spiders, and will sometimes follow their prey for a short distance, usually with small insects and small arthropods. Jack jumper ants, alongside M. simillima, have been given frozen houseflies (<b>Musca</b> domestica) and blowflies (Calliphoridae) as food under testing conditions. The ant has been observed to run and leap energetically at flies when they land, particularly on Acacia shrubs, plants or trees. Jack jumpers and other Myrmecia ants prey on insects such as cockroaches and crickets.|$|E

25|$|Typical genera are <b>Musca,</b> Hydrotaea, Stomoxys and Haematobia.|$|E
25|$|These are {{medium to}} large flies of compact structure, with clear wings of complex venation. Antennae are highly {{characteristic}} with antennae consisting of several compact segments that {{lie in a}} deep groove between the eyes; the outermost segment of each antenna bears a feather like structure, the arista, which projects forwards. Species within <b>Musca,</b> Hydrotaea, and similar genera have mouthparts adapted for sponging nutritious liquids with their labellar lobes (see photograph of Calliphora mouthparts which also have this sponge structure). Some species of this type, such as <b>Musca</b> vestustissima (Australian bush-fly) also have, {{as part of this}} sponge structure, small teeth that can scrape at host's skin down to superficial capillaries to feed on blood. Cattle are a typical host for <b>Musca</b> and similar species of house-flies that are attracted to protein containing liquids at the eyes and nostrils of their hosts.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{the constellations}} can be simply {{divided into two}} regions; namely the {{northern}} and southern sky, whose origins are distinctly different. The northern skies have constellations that have mostly survived since Antiquity, whose common names are based on Classical Greek legends or those whose true origins have now been lost. Evidence of these constellations have survived in the form of star charts, whose oldest representation appears on the statue known as the Farnese Atlas, which has been suggested {{to be based on the}} star catalogue of the Greek astronomer, Hipparchus. Southern hemisphere constellations are more modern inventions, which were created as new constellations, or become substitutes for some ancient constellation. e.g. Argo Navis. Some southern constellations were to become obsolete or had extended names that became foreshortened to more usable forms e.g. <b>Musca</b> Australis became simply <b>Musca.</b>|$|E
40|$|The fungus Entomophthora <b>muscae</b> (Entomophthoromycota, Entomophthorales, Entomophthoraceae) is a {{widespread}} insect pathogen responsible for fatal epizootic events in many dipteran fly hosts. During epizootics in 2011 and 2012 in Durham, North Carolina, we observed a transition of fungal infections from one host, the plant-feeding fly Delia radicum, to a second host, the predatory fly Coenosia tigrina. Infections first appeared on Delia {{in the middle of}} March, {{but by the end of}} May, Coenosia comprised 100 % of infected hosts. Multilocus sequence typing revealed that E. <b>muscae</b> in Durham comprises two distinct subpopulations (clades) with several haplotypes in each. Fungi from either clade are able to infect both fly species, but vary in their infection phenologies and host-specificities. Individuals of the more phylogenetically diverse clade I predominated during the beginning of the spring epizootic, infecting mostly phytophagous Delia flies. Clade II dominated in late April and May and affected mostly predatory Coenosia flies. Analysis of population structure revealed two subpopulations within E. <b>muscae</b> with limited gene exchange.
