40|$|A {{new way of}} {{developing}} novel synthesis strategies {{for the construction of}} monocyclic rings found in organic molecules is presented.

The results of the <b>method</b> are illustrated <b>using</b> <b>cyclohexanone,</b> pyrazole, and the Biginelli adduct as target ring systems with a view to discover new and greener strategies for their construction using multicomponent reactions.

40|$|The azo dye ethyl red (ER) doped methyl {{methacrylate}} (PMMA) polymer films were {{prepared by the}} sol-gel process and the repeat-spin-coating method, the all-optical switching characteristics of the film samples were investigated experimentally at different intensities and modulation frequencies of pump beam (532 nm, CW), {{and the influence of}} the doping concentrations and the solvents on the all-optical switching effect of the films was discussed. At low pump power (8 mW), the modulation depth of 50 % was obtained and the response time was near 1 ms at room temperature. Furthermore, the maximal modulation depth reaches 72 %. An excellent switching performance could be obtained by choosing the proper doping concentrations (from 2 wt% to 6 wt%) of the samples, and the switching characteristics of the samples can be improved <b>using</b> <b>cyclohexanone</b> solvent.

40|$|AbstractEnzyme {{stability}} {{is an important}} parameter in biocatalytic applications, {{and there is a}} strong need for efficient methods to generate robust enzymes. We investigated whether stabilizing disulfide bonds can be computationally designed based on a model structure. In our approach, unlike in previous disulfide engineering studies, short bonds spanning only a few residues were included. We <b>used</b> <b>cyclohexanone</b> monooxygenase (CHMO), a Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO) from Acinetobacter sp. NCIMB 9871 as the target enzyme. This enzyme has been the prototype BVMO for many biocatalytic studies even though it is notoriously labile. After creating a small library of mutant enzymes with introduced cysteine pairs and subsequent screening for improved thermostability, three stabilizing disulfide bonds were identified. The introduced disulfide bonds are all within 12 Å of each other, suggesting this particular region is critical for unfolding. This study shows that stabilizing disulfide bonds do not have to span many residues, as the most stabilizing disulfide bond, L 323 C–A 325 C, spans only one residue while it stabilizes the enzyme, as shown by a 6 °C increase in its apparent melting temperature...|$|R
40|$|Here, we show explicitely that iron in {{the wall}} of high {{pressure}} stainless steel reactors {{is necessary for the}} hydrogenation of ketones under HTPW conditions, <b>using</b> <b>cyclohexanone</b> as a model compound for more complex biomass-derived molecules. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The processing of lignocellulosic biomass to platform chemicals and fuels is likely to provide a pivotal resource stream in the near future. A promising technology is the treatment of this biomass with high temperature and pressure water. As formic acid and related low molecular weight oxygenates are among the species generated, it is conceivable that they can act as a hydrogen-source in hydrogenation reactions. Such reactions have been suggested to be catalysed by water (Richter & Vogel, 2001; Akiya & Savage, 2002) by bases like NaOH (Kishida et al., 2005; Kopetzki & Antonietti, 2010) and/or to involve “reactive hydrogen” (Kleinert & Barth, 2008). To achieve the temperatures required for HTPW, it is necessary to perform the reactions in a sealed vessel – usually a bench-top laboratory autoclave. Metals are typically components of the reactor walls used under these conditions, where their presence can interfere with reaction rates even if no catalyst is added to the system. Although many reports of HTPW processing {{can be found in the}} literature, only a few publications (Bjerre &...|$|R

30|$|The {{procedure}} for polyethylene isolation by a Soxhlet extractor {{in this study}} was based on a simple principle: difference in solubility behavior for each component in the composites. That is, polyethylene is soluble in a hydrophobic solvent at an elevated temperature and near insoluble at room temperature (Brandrup and Immergut 1966; Barton 1975). After cooling the extraction solution, resin components should form a dense precipitate and be successfully recovered by filtration of the entire extraction solution. Fillers such as graphite, calcium carbonate, starch, and cellulose are insoluble in hydrophobic solvents and remain in an extraction thimble throughout the operation. Organic additives such as antioxidants, UV-absorbents, and flame-retardants, which are mostly low molecular weight substances, have good solubility in organic solvents even at room temperature (Bolgar et al. 2008; Tolinski 2009). Various hydrophobic chemicals are known as good solvents for polyethylene at elevated temperature: hydrocarbons such as xylene and dodecane, and chlorinated hydrocarbons such as 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene and 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene. However, in this study we <b>used</b> <b>cyclohexanone,</b> which is typically not a good solvent for polyolefins due to a polar carbonyl function on the molecule, to improve resin recovery from the extraction solution. By cooling the solution to room temperature, polyethylene can form a precipitate, whereas hydrophobic organic additives remain in the extraction solution. Filtering the floating polyethylene precipitate and rinsing with a volatile solvent can yield a good sample with purity suitable for AMS measurement, and at the same time, can provide an estimate of the amount of resin content of composites.|$|R
