50|$|In 2007, after {{suffering}} severe bone pain, Jaxon-Bear {{was diagnosed with}} last stage multiple myeloma, a severe form of blood cancer that attacks the bones.

40|$|Stem cell {{transplantation}} forms {{an integral part}} of the treatment for multiple myeloma. This paper reviews the current role of transplantation and the progress that has been made in order to optimize the success of this therapy. Effective induction chemotherapy is important and a combination regimen incorporating the novel agent bortezomib is now favorable. Adequate induction is a crucial adjunct to stem {{cell transplantation}} and in some cases may potentially postpone the need for transplant. Different conditioning agents prior to transplantation have been explored: high-dose melphalan is most commonly used and bortezomib is a promising additional agent. There is no well-defined superior transplantation protocol but single or tandem autologous stem cell transplantations are those most commonly used, with allogeneic transplantation only used in clinical trials. The appropriate timing of transplantation in the treatment plan is a matter of debate. Consolidation and <b>maintenance</b> <b>chemotherapies,</b> particularly thalidomide and bortezomib, aim to improve and prolong disease response to transplantation and delay recurrence. Prognostic factors for the outcome of stem cell transplant in myeloma have been highlighted. Despite good responses to chemotherapy and transplantation, the problem of disease recurrence persists. Thus, there is still much room for improvement. Treatments which harness the graft- versus -myeloma effect may offer a potential cure for this disease.

40|$|Systemic {{chemotherapy}} {{has been}} the standard treatment for advanced I metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, particularly in {{those who do not}} harbour an epidermal growth factor receptor mutation. In the last decade, there was no established evidence to justify the use of more than 4 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy. However, the use of <b>maintenance</b> systemic <b>chemotherapy</b> and more recently targeted therapy {{for those who do not}} show evidence of benefit after standard chemotherapy have been demonstrated to delay progression and more importantly prolong survival. Use of pemetrexed after standard non-pemetrexed chemotherapy has brought an improvement in median survival by 2. 8 months. The use of more easily administered erlotinib as <b>maintenance</b> therapy after <b>chemotherapy</b> has been shown to improve the median survival by 1. 0 month. Use of bevacizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody, combined with standard chemotherapy to start with also appears to be safe and efficacious.

5000|$|Maintenance {{therapy is}} a medical therapy that is {{designed}} to help a primary treatment succeed. [...] For example, <b>maintenance</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> may be given to people who have a cancer in remission in an attempt to prevent a relapse.

40|$|VCAP (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone) -AMP (doxorubicin, ranimustine, and prednisone) -VECP (vindesine, etoposide, carboplatin, and prednisone) is a {{standard}} regimen for aggressive adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL). However, the efficacy of this regimen has not been fully elucidated for patients aged 70 years or older. Here, we retrospectively analyzed elderly patients with aggressive ATL at Nagasaki University Hospital between 1994 and 2010 to assess treatment outcomes. Of 148 evaluable patients, 54 were aged 70 years or older at diagnosis. The median survival time (MST) and overall survival (OS) at 2 years in elderly patients were 10. 6 months and 22. 1 %, respectively. Thirty-four patients received VCAP-AMP-VECP as the initial treatment, although the doses were reduced for most patients. In these patients, MST and OS at 2 years were 13. 4 months and 26. 6 %, respectively. Eleven of 34 patients (32 %) received <b>maintenance</b> oral <b>chemotherapy</b> {{after two or three}} cycles of VCAP-AMP-VECP, and MST and OS at 2 years were 16. 7 months and 32. 7 %, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{pulmonary}} function of children with acute leukemia. METHODS: Cross-sectional observational analytical study that enrolled 34 children divided into groups A (17 with acute leukemia in the <b>maintenance</b> phase of <b>chemotherapy)</b> and B (17 healthy children). The groups were matched for sex, age and height. Spirometry was measured using a spirometer Microloop Viasys(r) in accordance with American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society guidelines. Maximal respiratory pressures were measured with an MVD 300 digital manometer (Globalmed(r)). Maximal inspiratory pressures and maximal expiratory pressures were measured from residual volume and total lung capacity, respectively. RESULTS: Group A showed a significant decrease in maximal inspiratory pressures when compared to group B. No significant difference was found between the spirometric values of the two groups, nor was there any difference between maximal inspiratory pressure and maximal expiratory pressure values in group A compared to the lower limit values proposed as reference. CONCLUSION: Children with acute leukemia, myeloid or lymphoid, during the <b>maintenance</b> phase of <b>chemotherapy</b> exhibited unchanged spirometric variables and maximal expiratory pressure; However, there was a decrease in inspiratory muscle strength...|$|R
40|$|With the {{currently}} available cytotoxic and targeted drugs, metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) may {{be controlled by}} systemic treatment for a significant period of time. However, many questions remain about the optimal use of drugs and duration of treatment. We reviewed the data from clinical trials on the optimal duration of systemic treatment with chemotherapy and targeted therapy in mCRC patients. The feasibility of chemotherapy-free intervals has been studied in mCRC patients treated with chemotherapy alone, but the results are conflicting. Current data show that oxaliplatin may be safely interrupted, but do not allow a firm conclusion on {{the safety of a}} full treatment break of chemotherapy. For targeted therapy, continuous inhibition of intracellular signalling by prolonged administration would theoretically be beneficial for efficacy of treatment, and has been suggested by retrospectively collected data. Recent data from a prospective study show a clinical benefit for <b>maintenance</b> treatment with <b>chemotherapy</b> and bevacizumab with acceptable toxicity and preservation of quality of life.

However, the benefits of <b>maintenance</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> compared with observation are a subject of debate.

Three years later total body naevus counts were significantly increased, the median increase being 66 naevi per child (95 % confidence interval 57 to 94). The only other problem noted in these children was relatively poor regrowth of scalp hair.
