500|$|Docter made Venezuela the film's setting after Ralph Eggleston {{gave him}} a video of the tepui {{mountains}} of Canaima National Park; and tepuis were already featured in a previous Disney film, Dinosaur. In 2004, Docter and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days reaching Monte Roraima by airplane, jeep, and helicopter. They spent three nights there painting and sketching, and encountering ants, mosquitoes, scorpions, frogs, and snakes. They also flew to Matawi Tepui and climbed to Angel Falls. Docter felt [...] "we couldn't use [...] Reality is so far out, if we {{put it in the}} <b>movie</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't believe it." [...] The film's creatures were also challenging to design because they had to fit in the surreal environment of the tepuis, but also be realistic because those mountains exist in real life. The filmmakers visited Sacramento Zoo to observe a Himalayan monal for Kevin's animation. The animators designed Russell as an Asian-American, and modeled Russell after similar looking Peter Sohn, a Pixar storyboarder who voiced Emile in Ratatouille and directed the short Partly Cloudy, because of his energetic nature.|$|E

Principal photography was scheduled {{to take place in}} Tokyo, Rome, Toronto, and New York. Production was stopped in June 2006 after producer Tom Rothman told Liman [...] "The lead is 18. Wouldn't the movie be better if he was 25? You have a huge movie here and adults won't go and see an 18-year-old. They'll consider it a children's <b>movie.</b> <b>You</b> could make a bigger movie than that." [...] Liman agreed on casting older actors for furthering the romantic aspect of the film. In August, actor Hayden Christensen replaced Sturridge in the lead role as David just two weeks before the beginning of shooting, as the studio [...] "became concerned about not having a more prominent actor in their trio of young stars."

So even before we shot the first film it was an economic decision, a pre-existing creative decision, to change it." [...] Del Toro also praised the new film's director. [...] "We have Mark Pellington attached as director – I'm a big fan of his The Mothman Prophecies and his video work – and we are out to actors, so we're hoping to get things going soon."

[...] Ebert and his colleague, Gene Siskel, gave the film a [...] "Two Thumbs Up" [...] rating on their syndicated television program, Siskel and Ebert and the Movies. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post praised the film's director, writing that [...] "Glimcher shows an epicure's taste in his choice of both cast and crew. The look of [...] "The Mambo Kings" [...] is doubtless richer than the text, which is, however, strengthened by Glimcher's nostalgia for the teenage, eager America of the 1950s." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "The Mambo Kings is most fun when it practically dares you to swoon. It's a <b>movie</b> <b>you</b> don't have to believe to enjoy."

500|$|The Village Voice writer Rich Juzwiak {{felt that}} [...] "Christmas Time Is in the Air Again" [...] {{was the only}} song on Merry Christmas II You that matched [...] "the magic" [...] of her 1994 single [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You", {{describing}} it as [...] "exquisite".

[...] BBC critic Mike Diver was complimentary of the track, writing that, although the effect is [...] "less instant" [...] compared to the first single, [...] "Oh Santa!", it fits in well {{with the rest of the}} album and is [...] "perfectly formed". Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone simply described the orchestration of the original compositions [...] "One Child" [...] and [...] "Christmas Time Is in the Air Again" [...] as overwhelmingly Christmasy. In her 2012 single review of the song, Entertainment Focus writer Pip Ellwood awarded [...] "Christmas Time Is in the Air Again" [...] four out of a possible five stars. She praised the composition for its [...] "classy, soulful and sumptuous" [...] feel and labelled it as [...] "yet another festive classic from the Queen of Christmas".

500|$|... {{the film}} had {{a rating of}} 29% on review {{aggregator}} website Rotten Tomatoes. Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted that Madonna, left to her own devices and her own canny pace, is a very engaging comedian. [...] "When Madonna's no-nonsense pragmatism isn't being twisted into poses of lovable eccentricity, the actress is sexy and funny and never for a minute sentimental. At times she looks amazingly like Marilyn Monroe, but the personality is her own, more resilient and more knowing. As the WASP-y sleeping prince, Mr. Dunne gives the most stylishly comic performance of a career that's been largely underrated by the public. Though {{he seems to be}} Madonna's foil, he provides the movie with its backbone, even in its most ludicrous moments. He may well {{be one of the most}} truly sophisticated straight men in the business today." [...] However, he ended the review by saying that the film was short on outright guffaws. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post gave the film a mixed review, commenting that [...] "you may not feel as if you've seen a <b>movie.</b> <b>You</b> may not quite know what you've seen" [...] and that although he laughed too much, the film [...] "is outrageously inept, but not in a routine manner". Hinson also criticized the work of Foley, noting that he [...] "doesn't have the skill to sustain a cartoon style." [...] Philip Wuntch of The Dallas Morning News commented that the film is a deft and daffy comedy performance; Madonna is great with the one-liners. [...] As a movie star, Madonna may be an acquired taste. But one thing is certain: acquiring this particular taste is going to be an enjoyable experience." [...] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel gave a negative review saying, [...] "Luckily for her, Madonna can sing, and use it to save herself from this disgrace of a movie." ...|$|E
