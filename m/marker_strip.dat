Participants (6 M, 6 F) ran toward a target of three lengths along a 10 -m walkway consisting of two <b>marker</b> <b>strips</b> with alternating black and white 0. 5 -m markings. Five trials were conducted for each target length and impact task, with trials block randomized between the 6 participants of each gender. A 50 -Hz digital video camera panned and filmed each trial from an elevated position adjacent to the walkway. Video footage was digitized to deduce the gait characteristics. A linear speed/accuracy tradeoff between target length and approach time was found for both impact tasks (hard, r = 0. 99, p < 0. 01; soft, r = 0. 96, p < 0. 05). For the hard-impact task, visual control time increased linearly (r = 0. 99, p < 0. 05) when whole-body approach velocity decreased. Visual control time was unaffected by whole-body approach velocity in the soft-impact task. A constant tau-margin of 1. 08 describes the onset of visual control when approaching a target while running, with the control of braking during visual control described by a tau-dot of – 0. 85. Further research is needed to examine the control of braking in different targeting tasks. <br /...|$|R
30|$|In recent decades, {{lateral flow}} immunochromatographic strip (LFICS) has been {{increasingly}} applied as a diagnostic tool for point-of-care test (POCT) {{because of its}} simplicity, rapid speed, sensitivity, and specificity [1]. Nowadays, this technology has been applied for many areas such as food security, environment monitoring, and drug testing [2 – 8]. In {{order to meet the}} requirement of different detection, diverse signal <b>marker</b> <b>strips</b> had been developed, including colloidal gold strip, magnetic nanoparticles strip, and fluorescence strip [9 – 12]. As the typical nanomaterials, gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) have the color-tunable property with size, which also can be functionalized with peptides to avoid degradation in order to facilitate to finish quick immunological reaction and display different degree of color for half-quantitative detection [1, 11, 13]. Because of their unique advantages, such as simplicity, rapidity, and ease of interpretation, Au NPs-based LFICS was widely used for rapid diagnosis [1, 11, 13]. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) could be easily gathered through directing external magnetic field exposure; thus, the targeted molecule modified on the MNPs could be detected even with less amount used [14]. Magnetic signals could be entirely captured by the devices so that MNPs-based LFICS realized quantitative measurement, thereby increasing LFICS sensitivity [12, 14, 15]. Fluorescent NPs possessed many advantages, including photo-stability, wide absorption and narrow emission spectra, more noticeable size-dependent Stokes shifts, robust stability against photo-bleaching and chemical degradation, higher fluorescent quantum yield, high sensitivity, and large molar extinction coefficients [16 – 18]. These excellent properties rendered fluorescent NPs playing an important role for developing highly sensitive LFICS. Different kinds of fluorescence LFICS were studied, such as testing chloramphenicol, nitrated ceruloplasmin, ochratoxin, alpha fetoprotein [16 – 20].|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Given two {{comparative}} maps, that is two {{sequences of}} markers each representing a genome, the Maximal Strip Recovery problem (MSR) asks to extract a largest sequence of markers from each map {{such that the}} two extracted sequences are decomposable into non-overlapping strips (or synteny blocks). This aims at de ning a robust set of synteny blocks between di erent species, which {{is a key to}} understand the evolution process since their last common ancestor. In this paper, we add a fundamental constraint to the initial problem, which expresses the biologically sustained need to bound the number of intermediate (non-selected) markers between two consecutive <b>markers</b> in a <b>strip.</b> We therefore introduce the problem δ-gap-MSR, where δ is a (usually small) non-negative integer that upper bounds the number of non-selected markers between two consecutive <b>markers</b> in a <b>strip.</b> Depending {{on the nature of the}} comparative maps (i. e., with or without duplicates), we show that δ-gap-MSR is NP-complete for any δ ≥ 1, and even APX-hard for any δ ≥ 2. We also provide two approximation algorithms, with ratio 1. 8 for δ = 1, and ratio 4 for δ ≥ 2...|$|R
30|$|Taking the {{countermeasures}} for site PP 1 {{listed in}} Table 3 as a reference, the sets A, B and C {{could not be}} assessed through local predictive methods [28, 30] for the scenarios before and after interventions. In fact, <b>markers,</b> rumble <b>strips,</b> signs, trees, speed control, friction and road barriers are not variables of the local models. Actually, most of them, except for centerline rumble strips and speed control, are not considered by HSM models too. Hence, additional sources should be consulted for computing safety benefits (e.g. [50]). Conversely, the set D (Table 3), including alignment and road standard modifications, can be potentially assessed by all the methods considered, since they include geometric variables. However, synthetic geometric variables based on the overall alignment, may lead to estimates related to the whole section, {{rather than on the}} sum of short homogeneous segments, as in the HSM method.|$|R
40|$|AbstractGiven two genomic maps G 1 and G 2 each {{represented}} as a sequence of n gene <b>markers,</b> the maximal <b>strip</b> recovery (MSR) problem is to retain {{the maximum number of}} markers in both G 1 and G 2 such that the resultant subsequences, denoted as G 1 ⁎ and G 2 ⁎, can be partitioned into the same set of maximal strips, which are common substrings of length {{greater than or equal to}} two. The complementary maximal strip recovery (CMSR) problem has the complementary goal to delete the minimum number of markers. Both MSR and CMSR have been shown to be NP-hard and APX-complete, and they admit a 4 -approximation and a 3 -approximation respectively. In this paper, we present an improved 73 -approximation algorithm for the CMSR problem, with its worst-case performance analysis done through a local amortization with a re-weighting scheme...|$|R
40|$|Who are you? The "'self' is a {{philosophical}} construct {{that many people}} do not understand. Often, people use stereotypical markers, such as their name, age, gender, hobbies, religion, etc. However, we determined that these markers were unacceptable components of the self, as these typical <b>markers</b> can be <b>stripped</b> away and are, thus, {{a representation of the}} self, not its definition. To replace the current system of defining one's self, we developed a system that explains the self's composition in terms of "qualities," such as humor, bitterness, anger, joy, etc. To determine if people could look at their selves through these terms, we asked our peers to define their selves without the traditional markers. The results were varied, and the question posed great difficulty, as it asked the individual to dig deep within his or her self to find the answers he or she may not have wanted to find. However, through the challenges we created {{a better understanding of the}} self-emerged. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?...|$|R
40|$|Functionally {{contracting}} {{smooth muscle}} {{is an essential}} part of the engineered intestine that has not been replicated in vitro. The purpose of this study is to produce contracting smooth muscle in culture by maintaining the native smooth muscle organization. We employed intact smooth muscle strips and compared them to dissociated smooth muscle cells in culture for 14 days. Cells isolated by enzymatic digestion quickly lost maturity markers for smooth muscle cells and contained few enteric neural and glial cells. Cultured smooth muscle strips exhibited periodic contraction and maintained neural and glial <b>markers.</b> Smooth muscle <b>strips</b> cultured for 14 days also exhibited regular fluctuation of intracellular calcium, whereas cultured smooth muscle cells did not. After implantation in omentum for 14 days on polycaprolactone scaffolds, smooth muscle strip constructs expressed high levels of smooth muscle maturity markers as well as enteric neural and glial cells. Intact smooth muscle strips may be a useful component for engineered intestinal smooth muscle...|$|R
40|$|A {{new class}} of surface-enhanced Raman {{scattering}} (SERS) -based lateral flow assay (LFA) biosensor has been developed for the simultaneous detection of dual DNA <b>markers.</b> The LFA <b>strip</b> in this sensor was composed of two test lines and one control line. SERS nano tags labeled with detection DNA probes were used for quantitative evaluation of dual DNA markers with high sensitivity. Target DNA, associated with Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and bacillary angiomatosis (BA), were tested to validate the detection capability of this SERS-based LFA strip. Characteristic peak intensities of SERS nano tags on two test lines were used for quantitative evaluations of KSHV and BA. The limits of detection for KSHV and BA, determined from our SERS-based LFA sensing platform, were estimated to be 0. 043 and 0. 074 pM, respectively. These values indicate approximately 10000 times higher sensitivity than previously reported values using the aggregation-based colorimetric method. We {{believe that this is}} the first report of simultaneous detection of two different DNA mixtures using a SERS-based LFA platform. This novel detection technique is also a promising multiplex DNA sensing platform for early disease diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Given two genomic maps G 1 and G 2 each {{represented}} as a sequence of n gene <b>markers,</b> the maximal <b>strip</b> recovery (MSR) problem is to retain {{the maximum number of}} markers in both G 1 and G 2 such that the resultant subsequences, denoted as G ∗ 1 and G ∗ 2, can be partitioned into the same set of maximal substrings of length {{greater than or equal to}} two. Such substrings can occur in the reversal and negated form. The complementary maximal strip recovery (CMSR) problem is to delete the minimum number of markers from both G 1 and G 2 for the same purpose, with its optimization goal exactly complementary to maximizing the total number of gene markers retained in the final maximal substrings. Both MSR and CMSR have been shown NP-hard and APX-hard. A 4 -approximation algorithm is known for the MSR problem, but no constant ratio approximation algorithm for CMSR.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the factors responsible for migration and homing of magnetically labeled AC 133 + cells at the sites of active angiogenesis in tumor. AC 133 + cells labeled with ferumoxide-protamine sulfate were mixed with either rat glioma or human melanoma cells and implanted in flank of nude mice. An MRI of the tumors including surrounding tissues was performed. Tumor sections were stained for Prussian blue (PB), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α (HIF- 1 α), stromal cell derived factor- 1 (SDF- 1), matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP- 2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and endothelial <b>markers.</b> Fresh snap-frozen <b>strips</b> from the central and peripheral parts of the tumor were collected for Western blotting. MRIs demonstrated hypointense regions at {{the periphery of the}} tumors where the PB+/AC 133 + cells were positive for endothelial cells markers. At the sites of PB+/AC 133 + cells, both HIF- 1 α and SDF- 1 were strongly positive and PDGF and MMP- 2 showed generalized expression in the tumor and surrounding tissues. There was no significant association of PB+/AC 133 + cell localization and VEGF expression in tumor cells. Western blot demonstrated strong expression of the SDF- 1, MMP- 2, and PDGF at the peripheral parts of the tumors. HIF- 1 α was expressed at both the periphery and central parts of the tumor. This work demonstrates that magnetically labeled cells can be used as probes for MRI and histological identification of administered cells. —Arbab, A. S., Janic, B., Knight, R. A., Anderson, S.
