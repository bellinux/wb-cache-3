5|$|Aston Villa {{won their}} sixth FA Cup in 1920. For the {{remainder}} of the inter-war years though, Villa were on a slow decline that would lead to them being relegated to the Second Division in 1936 {{for the first time in}} their history. They returned to the top-tier of English football by the outbreak of the Second World War. As with many clubs, the war brought <b>much</b> <b>change</b> to Villa Park and remainder of the 1940s were spent rebuilding the team. By 1957, Villa were a Cup winning side once again with the clubs seventh FA Cup win. Even though Villa won the inaugural League Cup in 1960, the club were to enter into a very unsuccessful period. The 1960s saw <b>much</b> <b>change</b> at Villa Park. By the end of the 1960s, Villa were languishing in the Second Division and fan pressure led to the resignation of the Board and the introduction of Doug Ellis as Villa Chairman.|$|E
5|$|Having {{resigned}} most {{of their}} free agents, the club wouldn't see <b>much</b> <b>change</b> in the 2012 off-season, {{with the exception of}} losing unrestricted free agents Peter Mueller, Jay McClement and Kevin Porter. Colorado would add Greg Zanon, John Mitchell and high scoring winger P. A. Parenteau to its roster. Gabriel Landeskog, the Avs' lone representative at the 2012 NHL Awards, walked away with the Calder Memorial Trophy, joining Chris Drury, Peter Forsberg and Peter Stastny for earning top rookie honors for the Avalanche.|$|E
5|$|Another {{war with}} Russia {{followed}} in 1632 and was concluded without <b>much</b> <b>change</b> {{in the status}} quo. King Władysław IV then proceeded to recover the lands lost to Sweden. At {{the conclusion of the}} hostilities, Sweden evacuated the cities and ports of Royal Prussia but kept most of Livonia. Courland, which had remained with the Commonwealth, assumed the servicing of Lithuania's Baltic trade. After Frederick William's last Prussian homage before the Polish king in 1641, the Commonwealth's position in regard to Prussia and its Hohenzollern rulers kept getting weaker.|$|E

5|$|At the Opéra-Comique, {{after its}} 1883 revival, Carmen was always {{presented}} in the dialogue version with minimal musical embellishments. By 1888, {{the year of the}} 50th anniversary of Bizet's birth, the opera had been performed there 330 times; by 1938, his centenary year, the total of performances at the theatre had reached 2,271. However, outside France the practice of using recitatives remained the norm for many years; the Carl Rosa Opera Company's 1947 London production, and Walter Felsenstein's 1949 staging at the Berlin Komische Oper, are among the first known instances in which the dialogue version was used other than in France. Neither of these innovations led to <b>much</b> <b>change</b> in practice; a similar experiment was tried at Covent Garden in 1953 but hurriedly withdrawn, and the first American production with spoken dialogue, in Colorado in 1953, met with a similar fate.|$|E
5|$|Henry, to Thomas Cromwell's annoyance, {{insisted on}} {{parliamentary}} {{time to discuss}} questions of faith, which he achieved through the Duke of Norfolk. This led to {{the passing of the}} Act of Six Articles, whereby six major questions were all answered by asserting the religious orthodoxy, thus restraining the reform movement in England. It was followed by the beginnings of a reformed liturgy and of the Book of Common Prayer, which would take until 1549 to complete. The victory won by religious conservatives did not convert into <b>much</b> <b>change</b> in personnel, however, and Cranmer remained in his position. Overall, the rest of Henry's reign saw a subtle movement away from religious orthodoxy, helped in part by the deaths of prominent figures from before the break with Rome, especially the executions of Thomas More and John Fisher in 1535 for refusing to renounce papal authority. Henry established a new political theology of obedience to the crown that was continued for the next decade. It reflected Martin Luther's new interpretation of the fourth commandment ("Honour thy father and mother"), brought to England by William Tyndale. The founding of royal authority on the Ten Commandments was another important shift: reformers within the Church used the Commandments' emphasis on faith and the word of God, while conservatives emphasised the need for dedication to God and doing good. The reformers' efforts lay behind the publication of the Great Bible in 1539 in English. Protestant Reformers still faced persecution, particularly over objections to Henry's annulment. Many fled abroad, including the influential Tyndale, who was eventually executed and his body burned at Henry's behest.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Sinlaku {{become a}} typhoon, the JMA {{estimated}} it attained peak 10minute maximum sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph). Also on August31, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 205km/h (125mph). On September1, Sinlaku began undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, although cooler water temperatures caused by previous Typhoon Rusa prevented restrengthening. The typhoon turned {{more to the}} west-northwest on September2, and without <b>much</b> <b>change</b> in intensity, it passed just south of Iwo Jima that day and very near the Japanese island of Minamidaitojima around 2130UTC on September3. The next day, Sinlaku also passed just south of Okinawa Island, although its large 110km (70mi) eye crossed over the southern portion of the island; the JTWC estimated the storm had winds of 175km/h (110mph) while passing near Okinawa. A trough passing north of Sinlaku slowed the typhoon's westward movement. Dry air in the region, and later increased wind shear caused a steady weakening trend. On September6, Sinlaku passed a short distance north of Taiwan, and subsequently a west-northwest motion resumed. The JMA downgraded the typhoon to a severe tropical storm on September7 in the East China Sea, although the JTWC maintained it as a typhoon. Around 1030UTC that day, Sinlaku made landfall in east-central China near Wenzhou, a city near the border of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces. The storm weakened while progressing inland, although its circulation remained well-defined until dissipating on September9.|$|E

Subsequently tariffs were frozen during the administration of Enrique Bolaños (2002–2007), leading to a gradual deterioration of the utility's financial situation.|$|E

After the War, the vignerons returned home to their unkempt vineyards. The soils and vines had suffered and were sorely in need of nurturing. The growers began to fertilize, bringing their vineyards back to health. Those who could afford it added potassium, a mineral fertilizer that contributes to vigorous growth. By the mid-1950s, the soils were balanced, yields were reasonably low and the vineyards produced some of the most stunning wines in the 20th century.|$|E
