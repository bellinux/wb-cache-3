5000|$|The hormones {{banned by}} the EU in cattle farming were estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, zeranol, <b>melengestrol</b> acetate and {{trenbolone}} acetate. Of these, the first three are synthetic versions of endogenous hormones that are naturally produced in humans and animals, and also occur {{in a wide range}} of foods, whereas the last two are synthetic and not naturally occurring, which mimic the behaviour of endogenous hormones. Zeranol (alpha-zearalanol) is produced semi-synthetically, but it also occurs naturally in some foods. It is one of several derivatives of zearalenone produced by certain Fusarium. [...] Although its occurrence in animal products can be partly due to its ingestion in such feeds, alpha-zearalanol can also be produced endogenously in ruminants that have ingested zearalenone and some zearalenone derivatives in such feeds. [...] The EU did not impose an absolute ban. Under veterinary supervision, cattle farmers were permitted to administer the synthetic versions of natural hormones for cost-reduction and possibly therapeutic purposes, such as synchronising the oestrus cycles of dairy cows. All six hormones were licensed for use in the US and in Canada.|$|E
5000|$|Implantable {{contraception}} is also {{an option}} for animals, particularly for animal managers at zoos and other captive animal facilities who require reversible contraception methods for managing population growth in limited captive habitat. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums' (AZA) Reproductive Management Center (formerly known as the AZA Wildlife Contraception Center) at the Saint Louis Zoo in St. Louis, Missouri has {{played a major role}} in researching and disseminating contraception information to hundreds of institutions around the world since 1999 via its Contraception Database, which houses over 30,000 records for hundreds of species. One of the most popular contraceptive methods used by zoos (as well as in domestic animals) is the <b>melengestrol</b> acetate (MGA) implant, a progestin-based hormonal contraceptive developed in the mid-1970s. Other progestin-based implants that have been placed in animals include Norplant, Jadelle, and Implanon.

40|$|ABSTRACT Induced molting {{increases}} {{egg quality}} and egg production and extends the productive life of hens.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{efficacy}} of a recommended protocol of oral <b>melengestrol</b> acetate (MGA) to intravaginal medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), with or without equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG), for out-of-season breeding of sheep on Prince Edward Island. One hundred and twenty ewes were assigned to 1 of 4 groups in a factorial design and were treated with either an intravaginal MPA sponge or oral MGA. Ewes received either an intramuscular injection of eCG or a saline placebo at cessation of progestogen treatment. The reproductive performance was best for the MPA-eCG group, followed by the MGA-eCG, MGA-saline, and MPA-saline. Pregnancy rates of 66. 7 %, 43. 3 %, 31. 0 %, and 16. 7 %, respectively, and ratios of lambs born to ewes exposed to the ram of 1. 17, 0. 63, 0. 52, and 0. 23, respectively, were recorded for these groups. We concluded that, under the conditions of this study, the use of oral MGA resulted in fewer lambs than did the use of MPA sponges with eCG.
