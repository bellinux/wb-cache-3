5|$|The {{treatment}} of Tourette's focuses on identifying {{and helping the}} individual manage the <b>most</b> <b>troubling</b> or impairing symptoms. Most cases of Tourette's are mild, and do not require pharmacological treatment; instead, psychobehavioral therapy, education, and reassurance may be sufficient. Treatments, where warranted, {{can be divided into}} those that target tics and comorbid conditions, which, when present, are often a larger source of impairment than the tics themselves. Not all people with tics have comorbid conditions, but when those conditions are present, they often take treatment priority.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>troubling</b> {{aspect of}} colonizing the patroonships was enlisting the {{required}} number of colonists, {{so that the}} failure {{of many of the}} other proposed patroonships may in part be attributed to this fact. The patroons still dealt with the issues of a cautious people not caring to venture to an undeveloped world. As an owner of extensive lands in the sandy Gooi and of family estates in the not much more fruitful Veluwe, where several relatives were landowners and struggled to subsist on meager means, Van Rensselaer had an advantage — his agents needed to employ little persuasion to induce some Gooiers and Veluwers to migrate to more fruitful regions where the farming would be less difficult. In addition, he could depend on the indirect support of his nephew Wouter van Twiller, who had been appointed Director of New Netherland in 1632, and with whom he engaged in friendly correspondence at a time when Dutch directors opposed the patroons in every way. In 1634 he collaborated with Michael Reyniersz Pauw, the patroon of Pavonia on shipping cattle.|$|E
25|$|Out in {{the real}} world, however, the {{response}} has been overwhelmingly positive. I've signed books in five stores, with more than 1,000 buyers at each site. I've had one negative remark—that I should be tried for treason—and one caller on C-SPAN said that I was an anti-Semite. My <b>most</b> <b>troubling</b> experience has been the rejection of my offers to speak, for free, about the book on university campuses with high Jewish enrollment and to answer questions from students and professors. I have been most encouraged by prominent Jewish citizens and members of Congress who have thanked me privately for presenting the facts and some new ideas.|$|E

25|$|MBO55 and -56 {{also had}} {{issues with the}} {{controllers}} and the lubrication of the gear boxes, and the issues were soon corrected. The <b>most</b> <b>troubling</b> issue was a swaying motion when running on the suburban Vignoles rails. The riders complained to no avail until several derailments made the management aware of the severity. A Gullfisk was test-run and {{found to have a}} much smoother ride. A horizontal suspension was added, which helped somewhat to reduce the swaying. This could only be installed on the newer MBO55 and -56 series, as MBO50 had a different bogie design. The issue was never corrected in a satisfactory way.|$|E
25|$|On November 3, 1787, Don Manuel Gayoso de Lemos assumed {{military}} and civil {{command of the}} fort and the newly organized District of Natchez (West Florida), having been appointed district governor by Governor-general Esteban Rodríguez Miró, governor of Louisiana and West Florida. On his arrival, Gayoso de Lemos established an informal cabildo (council) of landed planters which was formalized in 1792. Most of the council were of non-Spanish origin having {{come down from the}} Ohio River Valley settlements (especially Kentucky). Gayoso de Lemos continued to encourage American settlement on Spanish soil, especially by Catholics, notably the Irish and the Scots, and by those who brought significant property. He moved the administrative part of the town of Natchez from the waterfront up onto the bluff. One of the <b>most</b> <b>troubling</b> aspects during his civil administration was confusion in the land titles, with a number of inconsistent land grants. Unfortunately, Rodríguez Miró's successor, Governor-general Carondelet was not amenable to rectifying the problem.|$|E

[...] They were also criticizing it for making an episode idolizing Britney in the first place, stating: [...] "Perhaps <b>most</b> <b>troubling</b> is the deification of a troubled popstar into a symbol of empowerment and self-esteem."

500|$|Dunn {{then moved}} {{onto the scene}} during the funeral, when the child trembled from seeing her mother's lips sewn shut. Described by her {{as one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>troubling</b> shots in {{mainstream}} music videos, the scene was inspired by Madonna's memory of her mother lying in her wake. The singer recalled in a 1991 interview with Vanity Fair, that she remembered that her mother's lips looked funny in the funeral. When she got closer, she saw that Madonna Sr's lips had been sewn together. This image of her mother had haunted Madonna for many years, and led her to comment that she never could resolve her Electra complex. The singer further explained: ...|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Thompson {{provided}} the narration for Jason Reitman's film Men, Women & Children, before seeing {{the release of}} a project she had been working on for many years. The period drama Effie Gray, based on the true-life story of art critic John Ruskin's disastrous marriage, was written by Thompson but became the subject of a copyright suit before being cleared for cinemas. [...] The American playwright Gregory Murphy claimed that Thompson's screenplay was an infringement on his play and screenplay The Countess, which deals with the same story. Murphy was initially offered a screenwriting fee and co-screenwriting credit with Thompson by Potboiler Productions, the original producers of Effie Gray, in settlement of his claim, but this settlement offer was impugned by the film's subsequent producers, Ms. Thompson and Donald Rosenfeld, who instigated the suit. In March 2013, the judge in the case, after allowing Thompson to submit a second revised screenplay into evidence from which Murphy claimed [...] "some of the <b>most</b> <b>troubling</b> material" [...] had been removed, ruled that while there were similarities, the screenplays were [...] "quite dissimilar in their two approaches to fictionalising the same historical events". Effie Gray was released in October 2014, to a modest reception. [...] Thompson also appeared in the film, alongside her husband Greg Wise and actress Dakota Fanning, but declined to promote it as did Mr. Wise.|$|E

2500|$|The {{addition}} of [...] "wet" [...] hardpoints meant the F-100C could carry {{a pair of}} 275U.S. gal (1,040l) {{and a pair of}} 200U.S. gal (770l) drop tanks. However, the combination caused a loss of directional stability at high speeds and the four tanks were soon replaced by a pair of 450U.S. gal (1,730l) drop tanks. The 450s proved scarce and expensive and were often replaced by smaller 335US gal (1,290l) tanks. <b>Most</b> <b>troubling</b> to TAC was the fact that, as of 1965, only 125 F-100Cs were capable of utilizing all non-nuclear weapons in the air force inventory, particularly cluster bombs and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. By the time the F-100C was phased out in June 1970, 85 had been lost in major accidents.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps <b>most</b> <b>troubling</b> of all, NASL {{owners were}} {{spending}} sums on player salaries {{that could not}} be covered by league revenue. [...] Whereas NFL owners in 1980 were spending on average 40% of the team's budget on player salaries, NASL owners were averaging over 70% of their budget on player salaries. The Cosmos in particular, owned by Warner Communications, were spending lavish sums on player salaries, and while other teams—such as Los Angeles, Jacksonville, Portland, Toronto, and Montreal—that were owned by major corporations could keep up with the Cosmos, owners without deep pockets could not keep pace with the spending levels. Owners spent millions on aging stars to try to match the success of the Cosmos, and lost significant amounts of money in doing so.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the ongoing}} French Revolution and {{subsequent}} exodus of French émigrés to Britain, the administration of William Pitt the Younger feared a [...] "Jacobin uprising" [...] aimed to overthrow Parliament and the King, and the widespread reach of the LCS and its pamphlets threatened a populist insurrection similar to what had been seen in France. What was <b>most</b> <b>troubling</b> about the LCS and societies like it were that they carefully operated within the law, meaning there was no legitimate reason for government interference in their activities. This tense climate resulted in infiltration of the LCS and other societies by government spies. These spies encouraged more radical societies to engage in potentially seditious activities, allowing the administration to paint them all as insurrectionists. As a result, the government was able to prosecute LCS members both for sedition and for their involvement with other societies potentially engaged in illegal activities. Ultimately, however, the LCS's popularity forced the government to rely on legislation {{to prevent the spread}} of the reform movement.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was born}} Nguam Phanit ( [...] ; [...] ) in 1906 in Ban Phumriang, Chaiya District, {{southern}} Thailand. His father, Sieng Phānit, was a shopkeeper of second generation Thai Chinese (Hokkien) ancestry and his mother, Klaun, was Thai. He renounced civilian life in 1926. Typical of young monks during the time, {{he traveled to}} the capital, Bangkok, for doctrinal training but found the wats there dirty, crowded, and, <b>most</b> <b>troubling</b> to him, the sangha corrupt, [...] "preoccupied with prestige, position, and comfort with {{little interest in the}} highest ideals of Buddhism." [...] As a result, he returned to his native rural district and occupied a forest tract near to his village. He named it Suan Mokkh from Thai [...] suan [...] "garden" [...] and Pali moksha [...] "release, liberation". He strove for a simple, pristine practice in attempt to emulate Gautama Buddha's core teaching, [...] "Do good, avoid bad, and purify the mind." [...] He therefore avoided the customary ritualism and internal politics that dominated Siamese clerical life. His ability to explain complex philosophical and religious ideas in his native Southern Thai attracted many people to his wooded retreat.|$|E
