50|$|The {{pneumatic}} torque screwdriver {{is widely}} used for assembly requiring higher levels of torque. These tools are commonly used in automotive, aerospace and marine manufacturing. Pneumatic tools require a constant pressurized air source. Torque {{for this type of}} torque screwdriver ranges from 1.5 in lb (0.17Nm) to 265 in lb (30Nm), and speeds range from 800 to 2600 RPM. These tools must be near their compressed air source, not a problem in manufacturing but less suitable for general <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Torque</b> may not be controlled as accurately as by electrically powered tools.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- In {{this article}} we project and {{manufacturing}} a new picking storage carrousel system. This mechanical system is used to automation motion sequence to feed material or pieces in the working area of a machine tool. A stepper motor on its operation allows a compact mechanical design based on gears. This motor supplies a <b>maintenance</b> <b>torque</b> at zero steps/s that holds up position of the carrousel avoiding to employ a brake. Its feedback control system carried out with a programmable logic controller allows an easy maintenance, good reliability and a low cost. Carrousel dynamics has been evaluated with a virtual instrument that works out the discrete time fourier transform on the signal supplied by a tachometric sensor. Taking account signal spectral analysis, angular speed was measured and finally the operational torque has been estimated. Key-Words:- Carrousel, dynamics, sensors, signal processing. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{data obtained}} {{in the study of}} an 18 -wheel western type log truck outfitted with CTI and carrying a highway load. Operating on grades of 20 and 25 percent, drive shaft torque was monitored to quantify stress levels on the drive train while varying tire deflection. This paper provides information on the limits of additional traction to be gained through the use of tire deflection when operating on steep terrain [...] without excessive tire slip or vehicle <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Torque</b> levels for each grade/deflection combination are presented. A combination of steep topography and escalating road construction costs have led to the use of shorter, steeper roads. To reach landings of harvesting operations with a minimum road length, spur roads are often constructed in the 20 to 25 percent slope range. Haul roads exist with grades. of 15 to 20 percent. An assist vehicle is often appraised for when grades exceed 16 percent. Utilizing the proper tire deflection for the application (based on speed and load) appears feasible through the use of central tire inflation (CTI) systems. Benefits have been seen in reduced vehicular damage to forest roads and increased tire life. An additional benefit realized with the use of CTI is improved traction on some road surface types; because of the increased tire tread length...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{motion of}} a {{cylinder}} on a floor or hard surface is both entertaining and instructive. With <b>maintenance</b> <b>torques,</b> motion {{can be sustained}} and controlled as illustrated in a video clip that can be viewed in the PDF file of this document. The analysis of such a cylinder with and without end caps is burned on rotation about its center of mass and restrained by a plane normal to the axis passing through its center of mass at an angle alpha. For small values of alpha, the governing equations are simplified, and for symmetric bodies, stability requires rotation greater than [2 square root of(JWL*) ]/J(sub X), where J is the transverse mass moment of inertia, W is {{the weight of the}} cylinder, L* is the cylinder length from the base to the center of mass, and JX is the mass moment of inertia about the longitudinal axis OX of the barrel. Comparisons to data are made and some applications are discussed...|$|R

In vitro studies indicate that conical and nonconical abutments exhibited sufficient resistance to the maximal bending forces and fatigue loading.

This type of gear consumes approximately 25% of its input power in the process. This renders the variable magnetic gearbox to less than 75% efficiency.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} the evaluation of a novel torque converter concept. Features of the concept include: (1) automatic and rapid adjustment of effective gear ratio in response to changes in external <b>torque</b> (2) <b>maintenance</b> of output <b>torque</b> at zero output velocity without loading the input power source and (3) isolation of input power source from load. Two working models of the concept were fabricated and tested, and a theoretical analysis was performed to determine the limits of performance.

40|$|Abstract Purpose This study {{evaluated}} the <b>torque</b> <b>maintenance</b> of universal abutment retaining screws using different tightening techniques, and coated or uncoated screws. Material and method The screws were tightened to implants as following: Control – 32 Ncm torque; H 20 – holding 32 Ncm torque for 20 s; R – 32 Ncm torque, repeated after 10 min (retorque); and H 20 +R – combining the two tightening techniques. Titanium and coated screws were also evaluated. Result Statistical analysis showed higher maintained torque for titanium screws (p< 0. 001). The H 20 +R technique showed the highest maintained torque (p= 0. 003), but the H 20 technique’s maintained torque was similar. Conclusion Titanium screws associating the two tightening techniques can improve maintained torque...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this research, the {{verification}} on {{the torque}} limiter is completed {{by using the}} mechanism of a torque limiter integrated with the infrared optointerrupter feedback detection. Through a shuttle and an infrared optointerrupter, {{it is meant to}} determine whether the rotation mechanism is affected by the mechanism of a torque limiter. With this, it is available to determine if any jamming happens. Through the testing verification of physical mechanisms, the feasibility for the torque limiter proposed by this research is conducted. It can avoid current shorting when dead jamming happens. Also, the detection circuits relevant to the detection of motor current feedback can be saved to reduce systematical circuit <b>maintenance</b> and manufacture <b>torque</b> limiters with long life expectancy, higher stability and low cost...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} was to examine the time-course of changes in electromyographic (EMG) and mechanomyographic (MMG), time and frequency domain responses during repeated, submaximal, concentric, isokinetic, forearm flexion muscle actions. Twelve men (mean age ± SD = 22. 6 ± 2. 2 yrs; body weight = 84. 0 ± 8. 3 kg; height = 178. 6 ± 8. 3 cm) performed 50 repeated, submaximal (65 % of concentric peak torque), concentric muscle actions of the dominant forearm flexors on an isokinetic dynamometer at 60 °·s- 1. Surface EMG and MMG signals were simultaneously recorded from the biceps brachii muscle. Polynomial regression analyses (first, second, and third order) were used to examine the composite patterns of responses for EMG amplitude (AMP), EMG mean power frequency (MPF), MMG AMP, and MMG MPF across the fatiguing workbout. The results indicated that across the fatiguing workbout EMG AMP increased linearly (r² = 0. 961), while EMG MPF decreased quadratically (R² = 0. 771), and MMG AMP and MMG MPF decreased linearly (r² = 0. 747 and r² = 0. 575, respectively). The increase in EMG AMP, but decreases in EMG MPF and MMG MPF may have reflected the fatigue-induced recruitment of higher-threshold motor units with lower firing rates (as described by the Onion-Skin Scheme) due to the buildup of metabolic byproducts which interfere with contractile properties of the activated muscle fibers. Despite potential increases in motor unit recruitment, MMG AMP decreased which may have been due to decreased muscle compliance. In addition to the Onion-Skin Scheme, {{it is also possible that}} the decrease in MMG MPF could be described by the Muscle Wisdom Theory which optimizes force production. Collectively, in the present study the increase in EMG AMP and decrease in MMG MPF may have reflected an increase in motor unit recruitment, but a decrease in motor unit firing rate which suggested that the <b>maintenance</b> in <b>torque</b> could be explained by both the Onion-Skin Scheme as well as the Muscle Wisdom Theory.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{compared}} the <b>maintenance</b> of tightening <b>torque</b> in different retention screw types of implant-supported crowns. Materials and Methods: Twelve metallic crowns in UCLA abutments cast with cobalt-chromium alloy {{were attached to}} external hexagon osseointegrated implants with different retention screws: group A: titanium alloy retention screw; group B: gold alloy retention screw with gold coating; group C: titanium alloy retention screw with diamond-like carbon film coating; and group D: titanium alloy retention screw with aluminum titanium nitride coating. Three detorque measurements were obtained after torque insertion in each replica. Data were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey's test (P < 0. 05), and t test (P < 0. 05). Results: Detorque value reduced in all groups (P < 0. 05). Group A retained {{the highest percentage of}} torque in comparison with the other groups (P < 0. 05). Groups B and D retained the lowest percentage of torque without statistically significant difference between them (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: All screw types exhibited reduction in the detorque value. The titanium screw maintained the highest percentage of torque whereas the gold-coated screw and the titanium screw with aluminum titanium nitride coating retained the lowest percentage.

40|$|Interior {{permanent}} magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) is highly appreciated by researchers in {{variable speed drive}} applications due to some of its advantageous features such as small size, high power density, simple <b>maintenance,</b> high output <b>torque,</b> high power factor, low noise and robustness {{as compared to the}} conventional IM and other ac motors. Although these motor drives are well known for their relatively high efficiency, improvement margins still exist in their operating efficiency. Particularly, the reduction of power loss for IPMSM still remains a challenge for researchers. Improvement of motor drives efficiency is important not only from the viewpoints of energy loss and hence cost saving, but also from the perspective of environmental pollution. The thesis presents development of a fuzzy logic based efficiency and speed control system of an IPMSM drive. In order to maximize the efficiency in steady state operation while meeting the speed and load torque demands a search based fuzzy efficiency controller is designed to minimize the drive power losses to achieve higher efficiency by reducing the flux. The air gap flux level can be reduced by controlling the d-axis armature current as it is supplied by rotor {{permanent magnet}}. In order for the drive to track the reference speed in transient operation another fuzzy logic based controller is designed to increase the flux depending on the speed error and its derivative. The torque component of stator current (q-axis component of stator current) is generated by fuzzy logic based speed controller for different dynamic operation depending on speed error and its derivative. In this work a torque compensation algorithm is also introduced to reduce the torque and speed fluctuations...|$|R
