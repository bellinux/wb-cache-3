In the FDD mode WCDMA, the system uses different frequency bands for the Uplink and Downlink communications. In the Time Division Duplexing WCDMA (TDD-WCDMA) mode, the system uses different time slots but the Uplink and Downlink share the common frequency band. In the TDD-WCDMA, there are two options for bandwidth: 1. 28 MHz and 3. 84 MHz. Users can send their data by spreading the data parts in a slot.

40|$|To {{enable a}} new level of {{connectivity}} among machines as well as between people and machines, future wireless applications will demand higher requirements on data rates, response time, and reliability from the communication system. This will lead to a different system design, comprising a wide range of deployment scenarios. One important aspect is the evolution of physical layer (PHY), specifically the waveform modulation. The novel generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) technique is a prominent proposal for a flexible block filtered multicarrier modulation. This thesis introduces an advanced GFDM concept that enables the emulation of other prominent waveform candidates in scenarios where they perform best. Hence, a unique modulation framework is presented that is capable of addressing a wide range of scenarios and to upgrade the PHY for 5 G networks. In particular, for a subset of system parameters of the modulation framework, the problem of symbol time offset (STO) and carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation is investigated and synchronization approaches, which can operate in burst and continuous transmissions, are designed. The first part of this work presents the modulation principles of prominent 5 G candidate waveforms and then focuses on the GFDM basic and advanced attributes. The GFDM concept is extended towards the use of OQAM, introducing the novel frequency-shift OQAM-GFDM, and a new low complexity model based on signal processing carried out in the time domain. A new prototype filter proposal highlights the benefits obtained in terms of a reduced out-of-band (OOB) radiation and more attractive hardware implementation cost. With proper parameterization of the advanced GFDM, the achieved gains are applicable to other filtered OFDM waveforms. In the second part, a search approach for estimating STO and CFO in GFDM is evaluated. A self-interference metric is proposed to quantify the effective SNR penalty caused by the residual time and frequency misalignment or intrinsic inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) for arbitrary pulse shape design in GFDM. In particular, the ICI {{can be used as a}} non-data aided approach for frequency estimation. Then, GFDM training sequences, defined either as an isolated preamble or embedded as a <b>midamble</b> or pseudo-circular pre/post-amble, are designed. Simulations show better OOB emission and good estimation results, either comparable or superior, to state-of-the-art OFDM system in wireless channels...|$|E
30|$|As {{the first}} major task, the {{feedback}} for CQI and TCI {{in the case of}} SLRU or LT-PMI/LT-CM in the case of NLRU needs to be calculated for each MS in the network. To accomplish this task, the channels--also referred to as channel impulse responses (CIRs)--corresponding to the links among each MS and its serving and interfering sectors in the network are generated. The complexity of this simulation step is significantly reduced because the required channels need to be generated only for the DL sounding OFDMA symbol, termed as Advanced <b>Midamble</b> (A-MIDAMBLE) in IEEE 802.16 m, and not for all OFDMA symbols in the DL portion of the frame in the case of TDD operation or in the DL frame in the case of FDD operation. After determining the TCI or LT-PMI/LT-CM feedback, the calculation of the CQI explicitly accounts for the BF gain achieved using the selected TCI or LT-PMI/LT-CM information. The determination of the TCI feedback for SLRU or LT-PMI feedback for NLRU relies on the maximization of the channel capacity with the channel being the average CIR per subband in the case of SLRU or the wideband CIR in the case of NLRU. When the TCI is calculated, filtering with the LT-CM is also performed as prescribed by the IEEE 802.16 m standard [3]. The calculation of the CQI is based on the post-processing SINR for an MMSE receiver and utilizes either a single BF vector in the case of TCI and LT-PMI or the singular vector corresponding to the largest singular value of the quantized signal covariance matrix in the case of LT-CM; in the latter case, the calculation of an M × M singular value decomposition (SVD) is implied where M represents the number of transmit (T ×) antennas at the BS transmitter. It is emphasized that the feedback information is generated assuming single data stream or rank- 1 transmission. The BS scheduler is responsible for making the necessary CQI adjustments depending on MU-MIMO and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) related criteria as it will be discussed later in this section. After the feedback information is available, transmission to the BS is simulated by assuming a fixed UL error rate value which is calculated from UL control channel simulations. MS feedback is transmitted every 5 ms (one frame) for CQI, TCI, and LT-PMI; the LT-CM is fed back every 20 ms (four frames). Finally, it is noted that the MS feedback is appropriately delayed at the BS before it is used by the BS scheduler. One frame delay is assumed between the MS feedback transmission and its usage by the BS scheduler.|$|E
