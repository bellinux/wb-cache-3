It is not truly distillation, but a recrystallization where {{the product is}} the mother liquor, and does not produce products equivalent to distillation. This process {{is used in the}} production of ice beer and ice wine to increase ethanol and sugar content, respectively. It is also used to produce applejack. Unlike distillation, freeze distillation concentrates poisonous congeners rather than removing them; As a result, many countries prohibit such applejack as a health measure.

25|$|With {{increasing}} attention {{being paid}} to saving energy, many methods have been proposed that avoid distillation altogether for dehydration. Of these methods, a third method has emerged and has been adopted {{by the majority of}} modern ethanol plants. This new process uses molecular sieves to remove water from fuel ethanol. In this process, ethanol vapor under pressure passes through a bed of <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> beads. The bead's pores are sized to allow adsorption of water while excluding ethanol. After a period of time, the bed is regenerated under vacuum or in the flow of inert atmosphere (e.g. N2) to remove the adsorbed water. Two beds are often used so that one is available to adsorb water while the other is being regenerated. This dehydration technology can account for energy saving of 3,000 btus/gallon (840 kJ/L) compared to earlier azeotropic distillation.|$|E

Results in a batch reactor showed that, for the <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> to have a pronounced effect {{on the performance of}} the enzyme, a ratio of at least 2 : 1 with respect to the weight of the immobilized enzyme must be used. It was also found that the ability of <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> to reduce inhibition by water is more noticeable when working in a packed-bed reactor. The physical contact between the <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> and enzymes is of utmost importance for the adsorption of water since water is markedly insoluble in the organic solvent...|$|R

2500|$|Zeolites are the {{aluminosilicate}} {{members of}} the family of microporous solids known as [...] "molecular sieves" [...] mainly consisting of Si, Al, O, and metals including Ti, Sn, Zn, and so on. The term <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> refers to a particular property of these materials, i.e., the ability to selectively sort molecules based primarily on a size exclusion process. This is due to a very regular pore structure of molecular dimensions. The maximum size of the molecular or ionic species that can enter the pores of a zeolite is controlled by the dimensions of the channels. These are conventionally defined by the ring size of the aperture, where, for example, the term [...] "8-ring" [...] refers to a closed loop that is built from eight tetrahedrally coordinated silicon (or aluminium) atoms and 8 oxygen atoms. These rings are not always perfectly symmetrical due to a variety of effects, including strain induced by the bonding between units that are needed to produce the overall structure, or coordination of some of the oxygen atoms of the rings to cations within the structure. Therefore, the pores in many zeolites are not cylindrical.|$|E

It was proven that <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> alone can catalyze the acylation of fructose oligomers using vinyl laurate, leading to multiple substitution of the oligomers. This effect was the most profound at conditions unfavorable for the enzyme, because this resulted in a relatively high concentration of the chemically produced adducts.

It was proven that even solvent pre-drying by <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> already causes the release of catalyzing compounds to the liquid, leading to subsequent catalysis.
