5|$|Despite Reagan urging Gorbachev to {{tear down}} the Berlin Wall, there are some such as Romesh Ratnesar of Time who commented that there is little {{evidence}} that the speech had any impact on the decision {{to tear down}} the wall, let alone an impact on the people he addressed. Another critic was Liam Hoare in a 2012 article in The Atlantic, who pointed to the <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the tendency for American media to focus on the significance of this particular speech, without weighing the complexity of the events as they unfolded in both East and West Germany and the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|During {{the end of}} {{his final}} season at Vicenza, Baggio {{shattered}} both the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the meniscus of his right knee while playing against Rimini on 5 May 1985, while attempting a slide tackle. The injury occurred two days before his official transfer deal to Fiorentina had been finalised, and it seriously threatened his career, at age 18. Although several team doctors feared he would not play again, Fiorentina retained their faith in him, agreeing to commit to the transfer as well as fund the required surgery, one of <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> Baggio's attachment to the club.|$|E
5|$|Of the <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> fighting, the {{foremost}} is retaliation. When players engage in play {{that members of}} the opposing team consider unscrupulous, a fight can ensue. The fight may be between the assailant and the victim, between the assailant and an enforcer from the victim's team, or between opposing enforcers. Fights that occur for retaliation purposes can be in immediate response to an on-ice incident, to incidents from earlier in the game, or to actions from past games. Enforcers who intend to start a fight have to consider their timing due to the Instigator rule. For example, putting the opposing team on a power play due to penalties incurred from fighting is less advisable when the game is close.|$|E

5|$|Outsourcing {{is among}} some of the <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> {{increased}} competition within developing countries. Aside from being a reason for competition, many First World countries see outsourcing, in particular offshore outsourcing, as an opportunity for increased income. As a consequence, the skill level of production in foreign countries handling the outsourced services increases within the economy; and the skill level within the domestic developing countries can decrease. It is because of competition (including outsourcing) that Robert Feenstra and Gordon Hanson predict {{that there will be a}} rise of 15–33 percent in inequality amongst these countries.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1847, Detroit {{fought to}} {{maintain}} the Capitol within its jurisdiction, but communities in the growing {{western part of the}} state had <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> wanting a move inland, including the need to increase defensibility by moving the state government away from the Canada–US border. Detroit had been occupied during the War of 1812, and the border area of Michigan of less than a mile between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, at the Detroit River continued to be occupied by British troops on both banks. Proponents of moving the capitol also sought to promote settlement and the economy in the interior, as well as making the government more accessible to the people throughout the state.|$|E

25|$|In recent historiographical works, pirates {{have been}} viewed through various lenses. Modern {{scholars}} have posited <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the rise in piracy in the early eighteenth century, from a growing social emphasis on economics and capitalism to rebellion against an oppressive upper class. Recent academic books on piracy in the Atlantic World focus on the pirates and their relationships with the wider world.|$|E
25|$|There are <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the Italian {{immigration}} to Argentina: Italy was enduring economic problems caused mainly by {{the unification of}} the Italian states into one nation. The country was impoverished, unemployment was rampant, certain areas were overpopulated, and Italy was subject to significant political turmoil. Italians saw in Argentina a chance to build for themselves a brand new life.|$|E

25|$|Although the German {{presence}} in Milwaukee after the Civil War remained strong, other groups {{made their way}} to the city. Foremost among these were Polish immigrants. The Poles had <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> leaving their homeland, mainly poverty and political oppression. Because Milwaukee offered the Polish immigrants an abundance of low-paying entry level jobs, it became one of the largest Polish settlements in the USA.|$|E
25|$|There are <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> {{the history}} and {{continued}} prevalence of racial segregation in U.S. churches, including racism, denominational differences, and isolation. This segregation also has effects on individuals and the larger society, including increased racism and segregation even outside of the church. However, segregated Black churches also have been a positive place for community organizing for civil rights and other issues, as well as offering a respite for Black individuals from the racism they face in integrated society.|$|E
25|$|As of 2007, 17% of incarcerated {{individuals}} in Canada were of Aboriginal descent, despite representing only 2.7% {{of the general}} population. This is a sixfold increase in rates of incarceration within the Aboriginal population {{as opposed to the}} general Canadian population. There are <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the over-representation of Aboriginals within the Canadian justice system. Lack of education, poverty, unemployment and abuse all lead to higher crime rates. Also, statistically, Aboriginals have a greater chance of conviction and subsequently, incarceration once convicted. They are also much less likely to receive parole during their sentence.|$|E

25|$|During the 1930s, many Nationalist Party {{leaders and}} wide {{sections}} of the Afrikaner people came strongly {{under the influence of}} the Nazi movement which dominated Germany from 1933 to 1945. There were <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> this. Germany was the traditional enemy of Britain, and whoever opposed Britain was seen as a friend of the Nationalists. Many Nationalists, moreover, believed that the opportunity to re-establish their lost republic would come with the defeat of the British Empire in the international arena. The more belligerent Hitler became, the higher hopes rose that a new era of Afrikanerdom was about to dawn.|$|E
25|$|The street {{children}} and children {{running away from}} home are connected. A child running away from home ends {{on the street in}} most situations. There is lot of data available on why children run away, revealing <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> doing so. Some reasons are simple, some complex. Some time the reasons are because of the child's behavior, and some times the causes are because of parents. A child not going to school or not doing home work and thus fearing beatings, is a very common cause. A child stealing money, fighting with siblings are reasons too.|$|E
25|$|There were <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the {{creation}} of AGTL. One was that the provincial government considered it sensible to have a single gathering system in Alberta to feed export pipelines, rather than a number of separate networks. Another was that pipelines crossing provincial boundaries and those leaving the country fall under federal jurisdiction. By creating a separate entity to carry gas within Alberta, the provincial government stopped Ottawa's authority at the border. Incorporated in 1954, AGTL issued public shares in 1957. The company later restructured as NOVA Corporation, sold its pipeline assets (now primarily operated by TransCanada Corporation), and transformed itself into NOVA Chemicals.|$|E

25|$|To some extent, the War of Independence exposed {{political}} and religious fissures in Irish society. The IRA killed over 200 civilians as alleged informers in the conflict. It has been alleged that groups like Protestants and ex-servicemen were disproportionately represented in this figure – an argument disputed by other historians. However whether due to violence and intimidation or due to their loyalty to the British presence in Ireland, between 1911 and 1926 some 34 percent of the Free State's Protestant population – or about 40,000 people – left the 26 counties, mostly for Northern Ireland or Britain. While there were <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> this, secession from the United Kingdom {{was a factor in}} Protestant emigration.|$|E

With all these, Bangladesh toured Sri Lanka and drawn all formats, whereas Zimbabwe also recorded their first series win against Sri Lanka and the captaincy of Mathews was criticized for <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> their losses. Though he injured several times in his captaincy career, and replaced by Upul Tharanga in many winning notes, reporters suggested that Mathews will not captain until 2019 Cricket World Cup.|$|E
