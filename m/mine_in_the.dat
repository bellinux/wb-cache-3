50|$|African coal {{production}} {{is expected to}} increase by an average of 3% per year from 2005 to 2011. South Africa is likely to be responsible {{for the majority of the}} increase; its production could increase to 276 Mt by 2011. Higher output would be attributable to the opening of <b>the</b> Kriel South <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> 2005, <b>the</b> Forzando South <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> 2006, <b>the</b> Mooikraal <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> mid-2007, and <b>the</b> Inyanda <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> 2008; and <b>the</b> expansions of the Goedgevonden and <b>the</b> Leeuwpan coal <b>mine</b> <b>in</b> 2006, <b>the</b> Syferfontein <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> 2007, <b>the</b> Mafube <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> 2008, and <b>the</b> Grootegeluk <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> 2010.|$|R

5|$|Against his father's wishes, Peter Fluor {{expanded}} Fluor's business {{outside of}} California in the 1930s. It built refineries in Texas, {{as well as}} oil pipelines and compressor stations from Panhandle, Texas, to Indianapolis, Indiana, for the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company. Fluor constructed the Escondida in Chile, which is the second-largest copper <b>mine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. In 1942, Fluor constructed cooling towers and other facilities in Hanford, Washington, for the Manhattan Project. It built {{an expansion of the}} Dhahran Airfield in Saudi Arabia for the United States Army in the 1950s and accepted its first international project for ARAMCO in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, Australia has no {{nuclear power}} {{stations}} but ex-Prime Minister Tony Abbott supported nuclear power for Australia. As of 2015, Australia has five uranium mines, four {{of which are}} located in South Australia. Olympic Dam (Roxby Downs) is a large underground mine, Beverley, Four Mile and Honeymoon are in-situ leach mines and Ranger in an open pit <b>mine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Northern Territory. Uranium mined in Australia is mainly for export. Australia has no nuclear weapons or nuclear-powered vessels.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Hull-Rust-Mahoning <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> Hibbing, Minnesota, United States, {{is one of}} {{the largest}} open pit iron <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, with a 1.5-by-3.5-mile {{footprint}} and depths up to 600 feet. <b>The</b> <b>mine,</b> located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mesabi Range, supplied as much as one-fourth of all <b>the</b> iron ore <b>mined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States during its peak production during World War I and World War II.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1907, {{nearly all}} <b>the</b> copper <b>mined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US came from {{underground}} vein deposits, averaging 2.5 percent copper. By 1991, the average grade of copper ore <b>mined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US {{had fallen to}} only 0.6 percent.|$|R
5000|$|The {{heavy duty}} Transguinean Railways is about 750 km long {{and would be}} [...] (standard gauge). It goes from iron ore <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south east and bauxite <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north to a new port a Matakong.|$|R
5|$|Former {{mines in}} Italy, the United States and Mexico, which once {{produced}} {{a large proportion}} of the world supply, have now been completely mined out or, in the case of Slovenia (Idrija) and Spain (Almadén), shut down due to the fall of the price of mercury. Nevada's McDermitt Mine, the last mercury <b>mine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, closed in 1992. The price of mercury has been highly volatile over the years and in 2006 was $650 per 76-pound (34.46kg) flask.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Ranger Uranium <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Northern Territory and the Roxby Downs/Olympic Dam mine in South Australia {{continued}} to operate, but Nabarlek Uranium Mine had closed. A third uranium mine, Beverley Uranium Mine in SA, was also operating. Several advanced projects, such as Honeymoon in SA, Jabiluka in the Northern Territory and Yeelirrie in WA were on hold {{because of political}} and indigenous opposition.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013 it was {{announced}} that the medals for the games would be produced and designed by the Royal Canadian Mint. In September 2014, it {{was announced}} that the supplier of the raw minerals used in the medals (over 4,000 in total) would be Barrick Gold. All the materials used in the medals will come from the company's operations in the Pan American region. The copper was mined at the company's Zaldivar mine in Chile, the silver at the Pueblo Viejo <b>mine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dominican Republic and the gold was mined at the Hemlo mine in Ontario.|$|E

5|$|In the U.S., {{diamonds}} {{have been}} found in Arkansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Montana. In 2004, the discovery of a microscopic diamond in the U.S. led to the January 2008 bulk-sampling of kimberlite pipes in a remote part of Montana. The Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas is open to the public, and is the only <b>mine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world where members of the public can dig for diamonds.|$|E
5|$|The British {{information}} gathering vessel St Georges, {{which holds}} the Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator (ATAC), the system {{used by the}} Ministry of Defence to communicate with and co-ordinate the Royal Navy's fleet of Polaris submarines, is sunk after accidentally trawling an old naval <b>mine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ionian Sea. MI6 agent James Bond is ordered by the Minister of Defence, Sir Frederick Gray and MI6 Chief of Staff, Bill Tanner, to retrieve the ATAC before the Soviets, as the transmitter could order attacks by the submarines' Polaris ballistic missiles.|$|E
5|$|The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers most {{land in the}} Trout Creek Mountains, {{but there}} are also some private lands and some roads in the area. The private lands are mainly used for {{ranching}} along mountain streams, while the BLM lands include large grazing allotments for local ranchers' cattle. At least 100 mining claims in the mountains have been recorded since 1892, some of which were staked for gold exploration. Commercial mining has occurred in some areas, mostly near the McDermitt Caldera, where uranium and large amounts of mercury have been extracted. Mines in what was called the Opalite Mining District produced 270,000 flasks of mercury—"the richest supply of mercury in the western hemisphere"—from cinnabar extracted from the caldera in the 20thcentury. The two leading mercury-producing mines in North America were the Cordero and McDermitt mines {{on the edge of the}} caldera in Nevada. Together, they operated from 1933 to 1989. The McDermitt Mine, the last mercury <b>mine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, closed three years later, in 1992. However, mineral exploration has continued at the Cordero <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 21stcentury, and waste containing mercury and arsenic was returned there from the community of McDermitt as part of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cleanup project.|$|E

25|$|Yellowknife was {{originally}} {{established as a}} supply centre for numerous gold <b>mines</b> operating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1930s and early 1940s. The following {{is a list of}} the major mines, all of which are now closed. There were also tungsten, tantalum and uranium <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity. Most <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yellowknife area are within the Kam Group, a part of the Yellowknife greenstone belt.|$|R
50|$|The first {{underground}} shaft <b>mine</b> {{was built}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region <b>in</b> 1874 near Scammon. Prior to that, there was scattered small-scale drift mining and surface mining of coal, but {{the construction of}} the first shaft <b>mine</b> ushered <b>in</b> an era which eventually led to as many as 290 significant mines and numerous other small ("dinky") <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two counties. The most active period of <b>mining</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region was 1890-1910, and most of the coal camps were dismantled by the 1930s or 1940s. Mechanized strip mining overtook underground <b>mining</b> <b>in</b> output in 1931, and that combined with competition from eastern coal led to a demise in importance of underground <b>mining</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region.|$|R
5|$|The Earl of Warwick's estates {{included}} sawmills, quarries, brickworks and collieries {{in addition}} to agricultural holdings. Bell pits, around Clutton and High Littleton, were described {{in a survey of}} 1610. All were closed by 1836. The first deep <b>mine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> parish of High Littleton was Mearns Coalworks which began in 1783. The Greyfield Coal Company did not start until 1833 and expanded after the opening of the Bristol and North Somerset Railway in 1847. Greyfield Colliery closed in 1911, and the railway in 1964. Maynard Terrace in Clutton was built to house some of the miners.|$|E
5|$|The Jews of the {{occupied}} territories were subjected to forced labour by the Hungarian authorities, with about 4,000 Bačka and Baranja Jews being sent to hard labour camps within Hungary, 1,500 Bačka Jews being among the 10,000 Hungarian Jews sent to perform labour tasks for the Hungarian Army on the Eastern Front in September 1942, and about 600 Bačka Jews sent {{to work in the}} Bor copper <b>mine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> German-occupied territory of Serbia in July 1943. Only 2 per cent of those sent to the Eastern Front survived the war.|$|E
5|$|A celebration {{broke out}} among the miners, who broke into liquor {{warehouses}} and saloons. That night, some of the miners loaded a flatcar with dynamite and attempted to roll it toward the deputies' camp. It overturned short of its goal and killed a cow. Other miners wanted to blow up every <b>mine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region, but Johnson quickly discouraged them. Frustrated, several drunken miners then stole a work train and steamed into Victor. They {{caught up with the}} group of fleeing deputies, and a gun battle broke out. One deputy and one miner died, a man on each side was wounded, and six strikers were captured by the deputies. The miners subsequently captured three officials of the Strong mine who had been present when the shafthouse was blown up. A formal prisoner exchange later freed all prisoners on both sides.|$|E
50|$|Historically, copper was <b>mined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area.|$|R
25|$|Shamokin Creek was {{impacted}} by waste from coal mines {{as early as}} the early 1900s. Anthracite mining was historically a prevalent industry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed. Although production peaked in 1917, with 4400 men mining 6.2 million tons of coal annually, coal <b>mining</b> still continues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed. Most <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed closed by 1960 and <b>mining</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed is not expected to increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. However, as of 2001, there are more than 20 <b>mining</b> permits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed.|$|R
50|$|Großschirma {{benefited from}} <b>the</b> growth of <b>mining</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Freiberg Mining Field. The {{state-owned}} mine Churprinz Friedrich August Erbstolln (short: Churprinz) {{on the west}} bank of the river Freiberger Mulde was one of <b>the</b> most profitable <b>mines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field. The ore extracted there was conveyed to <b>the</b> smelters <b>in</b> Halsbrücke on an artificial waterway, the Churprinzer Bergwerkskanal.|$|R
5|$|At Merriweather, M-64 turns easterly again, {{this time}} merging with M-28 and {{becoming}} {{a part of the}} Lake Superior Circle Tour. The two highways run together along the northern end of Lake Gogebic to Bergland. Turning north once again, M-64 crosses a branch line of the Canadian National Railway. The highway runs through more dense forests parallel to the Big Iron River on this north–south leg. The trunkline leaves the national forest as it passes into the community of White Pine, and the road runs near a former copper <b>mine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. M-64 approaches the shores of Lake Superior at Silver City. There, it meets the eastern terminus of the former M-107, a highway designation that ran west into the Porcupine Mountains along the current 107th Engineers Memorial Highway. M-64 turns east along Lake Superior following the shoreline to the outskirts of Ontonagon. The highway crosses the Ontonagon River and terminates on the eastern shore. The current intersection with US45 that marks the end of M-64 {{on the south side of}} downtown is also the western terminus of M-38.|$|E
5|$|Coal mining {{was done}} in the {{watershed}} of Black Creek as early as the winter of 1836–1837. Several people operated in the area until 1865, when it was leased to the E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company for 99 years. However, the mining was stopped by a strike in 1872 and for some time thereafter mining was done by several smaller companies. The <b>mine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed was run by the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad between 1901 and 1921. The Glen Alden Corp. then operated it until 1938, at which point underground mining in the watershed stopped. Strip mining was already underway there and it continued until 1955, when all mining stopped. During World War II, coal waste in the watershed was rerun through a coal processing plant to recover coal. In 1971, the land was owned by the Blue Coal Company. A total of 22 million tons of coal have been mined in the area.|$|E
5|$|Gneisenau and Potsdam {{were to be}} renamed Jade and Elbe, respectively. Once converted, {{the ships}} were {{intended}} to operate twelve Ju-87 Stuka dive bombers and twelve Bf-109 fighters. Work on Jade was not started and the conversion project was abandoned in November 1942. She returned to service as a troopship, only to be sunk by a <b>mine</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western Baltic. Elbe actually began the conversion process in December 1942, but only her passenger fittings were removed by the time work was halted in February 1943. She was converted into a barracks ship in Gotenhafen and seized by the United Kingdom {{after the end of}} the war. She remained in use until 1976, when she was broken up for scrap. A third ocean liner of the same class, , was purchased by the Imperial Japanese Navy and converted into the escort carrier Shin'yō. Shin'yō was torpedoed and sunk in the East China Sea by a United States Navy submarine.|$|E
