5|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the quantum aspects of gravity in our four-dimensional universe, some physicists have considered a lower-dimensional mathematical <b>model</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> spacetime has only two spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this setting, the mathematics describing the gravitational field simplifies drastically, and one can study quantum gravity using familiar methods from quantum field theory, eliminating the need for string theory or other more radical approaches to quantum gravity in four dimensions.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} is evaluated of three distinct classes of turbulence model. These classes are: (1) Turbulent-viscosity <b>models</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the length {{scale of turbulence}} is found by way of algebraic formulas, (2) turbulent-viscosity <b>models</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the length scale of turbulence is found from a partial differential equation of transport, and (3) <b>models</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the shear stress itself is the dependent variable of a partial differential conservation equation. Two <b>models</b> were examined <b>in</b> each class; thus, six different models were tested. A complete mathematical statement of these models is provided and a brief commentary on the models is included...|$|R
5|$|An {{intuitive}} {{understanding of}} X-ray diffraction {{can be obtained}} from the Bragg model of diffraction. In this model, a given reflection is associated with a set of evenly spaced sheets running through the crystal, usually passing through the centers of the atoms of the crystal lattice. The orientation of a particular set of sheets is identified by its three Miller indices (h, k, l), and let their spacing be noted by d. William Lawrence Bragg proposed a <b>model</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the incoming X-rays are scattered specularly (mirror-like) from each plane; from that assumption, X-rays scattered from adjacent planes will combine constructively (constructive interference) when the angle θ between the plane and the X-ray results in a path-length difference that is an integer multiple n of the X-ray wavelength λ.|$|E
5|$|Geometrical optics {{provides}} further matrix applications. In this approximative theory, {{the wave}} nature of light is neglected. The {{result is a}} <b>model</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> light rays are indeed geometrical rays. If the deflection of light rays by optical elements is small, the action of a lens or reflective element on a given light ray can be expressed as multiplication of a two-component vector with a two-by-two matrix called ray transfer matrix: the vector's components are the light ray's slope and its distance from the optical axis, while the matrix encodes {{the properties of the}} optical element. Actually, {{there are two kinds of}} matrices, viz. a refraction matrix describing the refraction at a lens surface, and a translation matrix, describing the translation of the plane of reference to the next refracting surface, where another refraction matrix applies.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 the {{physicist}} Niels Bohr proposed a <b>model</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could {{only do so}} in a finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon. This quantization was used to explain why the electrons orbits are stable (given that normally, charges in acceleration, including circular motion, lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, see synchrotron radiation) and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra.|$|E

30|$|Economic {{models of}} {{discrimination}} can broadly be classified into two classes: (i) competitive <b>models</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> agents act individually, and (ii) collective <b>models</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> groups act collectively {{against each other}} (Altonji and Blank 1999 : 3168). In general, economic analysis has focused on competitive models which underline two broad types of discrimination. The first is “taste-based discrimination” and the second, “statistical discrimination”.|$|R
5|$|In {{his later}} years, Fermi {{continued}} {{teaching at the}} University of Chicago. His PhD students in the post-war period included Owen Chamberlain, Geoffrey Chew, Jerome Friedman, Marvin Goldberger, Tsung-Dao Lee, Arthur Rosenfeld and Sam Treiman. Jack Steinberger was a graduate student. Fermi conducted important research in particle physics, especially related to pions and muons. He made the first predictions of pion-nucleon resonance, relying on statistical methods, since he reasoned that exact answers were not required when the theory was wrong anyway. In a paper co-authored with Chen Ning Yang, he speculated that pions might actually be composite particles. The idea was elaborated by Shoichi Sakata. It has since been supplanted by the quark <b>model,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the pion {{is made up of}} quarks, which completed Fermi's model, and vindicated his approach.|$|E
5|$|One {{early and}} {{influential}} theory of scientific explanation is the deductive-nomological model. It {{says that a}} successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a scientific law. This view {{has been subjected to}} substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory. It is especially challenging to characterize what is meant by an explanation when the thing to be explained cannot be deduced from any law because {{it is a matter of}} chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed a <b>model</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained. Others have argued that the key to a good explanation is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.|$|E

40|$|I {{distinguish}} {{two types}} of macroeconomic models. The first type are top-down <b>models</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> some or all agents are capable of understanding the whole picture and use this superior information to determine their optimal plans. The second type are bottom-up <b>models</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> all agents experience cognitive limitations.

30|$|Agent-based {{models are}} {{typically}} “simple-agent” <b>models,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> agents behave according to simple rules, or “complex-agent” models which incorporate complex models of cognitive processes.

In particular, I argue that such models have the potential to bring insights from the humanistic study of culture into population-level modeling of cultural change.|$|R
