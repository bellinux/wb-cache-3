40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we provide}} a {{generalized}} {{framework for the}} dynamic control of redundant manipulators applied to robot-assisted minimally invasive surgeries (RA-MIS), dealing simultaneously with kinematic constraints, surgical tool trajectory and collisions in the robot’s body. During a RA-MIS, a robot inserts a surgical tool into the patient’s body through an incision point, known as the trocar point. A kinematic constraint is then generated since the tool axis must always pass through the trocar point, i. e. Remote Center of Motion (RCM) constraint, while the tool tip executes the surgical task. When a serial manipulator is used, the RCM constraint must be guaranteed by the control system. Moreover, during the event of desired or unexpected collisions between the robot’s body and its environment, e. g. <b>medical</b> <b>staff</b> or operating <b>room</b> equipment, during the surgical procedure, we propose a joint compliance strategy to preserve the surgical task,by exploiting the robot Jacobian null-space.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a field monitoring study of three medical wards at Padua General Hospital (Orthopaedics, Internal Medicine and Paediatrics), based on measurements of indoor conditions and on a survey of patient and <b>medical</b> <b>staff</b> perceptions. Microclimatic conditions were measured over an extended period using data loggers with a time step of 5 min. Maximum in-patient room temperatures exceeded 29 °C while mean values were around 26 - 27 °C. Generally, microclimatic conditions differed between in-patient and <b>staff</b> <b>rooms.</b> Spot and long-term monitoring was used to calculate PMV profiles which were compared to thermal comfort showing non uniform correspondence among wards and their occupants. Innovative statistical nonparametric methods were applied to analyse the survey, comparing the wards from both patient and staff points of view. Staff complained mostly about lack of privacy, room size, amount of common areas, poor air quality and acoustic discomfort, with significant differences between wards in relation to levels of satisfaction with building-related aspects. Patients, on the other hand, were more satisfied with both building-related aspects and indoor conditions than <b>medical</b> <b>staff.</b> Such a global assessment could easily be used, for example, to rank the necessity or the priority of changes or improvements to buildings as well as determine the most important features, both individually and globally, to be taken into consideration...|$|R

40|$|Background: In China, public {{hospital}} reform has been underway for almost 5 years, and 311 pilot county hospitals are the current focus. This study aimed {{to assess the}} job satisfaction and active participation of <b>medical</b> <b>staff</b> in the reform. A total of 2268 <b>medical</b> <b>staff</b> members in pilot and non-pilot county hospitals in Hubei, China, were surveyed. Methods: Questionnaires were used to collect data. The Pearson chi-square statistical method {{was used to assess}} the differences between pilot and non-pilot county hospitals and identify the factors related to job satisfaction as well as the understanding and perception of the reform. Binary logistic regression was performed to determine the significant factors that influence the job satisfaction of <b>medical</b> <b>staff</b> in pilot county hospitals. Results: <b>Medical</b> <b>staff</b> members in pilot county hospitals expressed higher satisfaction on current working situation, performance appraisal system, concern showed by leaders, hospital management, and compensation packages (P < 0. 05). They were exposed to work-related stress at a higher extent (P < 0. 05) and half of them worked overtime. Within pilot county hospitals, {{less than half of the}} <b>medical</b> <b>staff</b> members were satisfied with current job and they have evidently less satisfaction on compensation packages and learning and training opportunities. The working hours and work stress were negatively related to the job satisfaction (P < 0. 05). Satisfaction on the performance appraisal system, hospital management, compensation packages, and learning and training opportunities were positively related to job satisfaction (P < 0. 05). <b>Medical</b> <b>staff</b> in pilot county hospitals exhibited better understanding of and more positive attitude towards the reform (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Pilot county hospitals have implemented some measures through the reform, but there still are deficiencies. The government officials and hospital administrators should pay attention to influencing factors of job satisfaction and focus on the reasonable demands of <b>medical</b> <b>staff.</b> In addition, the <b>medical</b> <b>staff</b> in pilot county hospitals exhibited a better understanding of the {{public hospital}} reform programme and showed more firm confidence, but there still were some <b>medical</b> <b>staff</b> members who hold negative attitude.
