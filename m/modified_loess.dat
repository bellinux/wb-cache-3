40|$|A {{laboratory}} study was executed {{to investigate the}} effect of surfactants to enhance sorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contaminants in loess soil. Phenanthrene and naphthalene were chosen as organic contaminant indicators in loess soil modi. fied by the cation surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA) bromide. The kinetic behavior of sorption during transport in natural and <b>modified</b> <b>loess</b> soil was studied. The results indicated that sorption rate in the cation surfactant <b>modified</b> <b>loess</b> soils was at least 3 times faster {{than that of the}} natural soil. A first-order kinetics model fitted the sorption data well for both soils. The sorption rates of the two organic compounds were related to their primary residual quantity on the soils. The experiments showed that sorption amounts approached constant values approximately within 30 and 90 min for naphthalene and phenanthrene at 298 - 318 K, respectively. The rate constants, however, displayed negative correlation with increasing temperature. With changing temperature, the activation energy was calculated at - 6. 196 - 1. 172 kJ/ mol for naphthalene and) 28. 86 - 15. 70 kJ/ mol for phenanthrene at 298 - 318 K. The results can be used to predict the sorption kinetics of phenanthrene and naphthalene in loess soils, and in a wider perspective, be used to better understand the transport of petroleum contaminants in the soil environment...|$|E

As a kind of foundation treatment method, improved by fly ash is more and more used in highway, railway roadbed construction. With the increase of speed of vehicles and vehicle load, the influence of dynamic load on the subgrade has caused people's concern. In this paper, based on fly ash <b>modified</b> <b>loess,</b> dynamic property of modified fly ash loess is discussed through the dynamic triaxial test of the unsaturation disturbed loess. The effect of the dynamic elastic modulus and the damping ratio with different amount of fly ash loess is studied. The results show that the difference of dynamic properties in dynamic load and static load is large. It mainly presents the hysteresis quality and nonlinear relationship between dynamic stress and dynamic strain. And the dynamic elasticity modulus increases with fly ash mixed amount...|$|E
40|$|In {{view of the}} loess plateau serious {{soil erosion}} problem, a {{distributed}} soil erosion model on the small watershed was developed base on distributed hydrology model. Erosion caused by rainfall and runoff was computed with the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), and we <b>modified</b> USLE with <b>loess</b> plateau data. The Equation thinks about the rainfall, the soil, the vegetation, the support practice factor and so on. Sediment transport in the channel network was a function of two processes, deposition and degradation, operating simultaneously in the reach. A simple sediment channel routing method was developed with distributed hydrology model. A case of Chabagou catchments indicated that this model was simple and practical...|$|R
40|$|As {{a special}} kind of soil is widely {{distributed}} in Loess Plateau of northwest China, it is difficult to use for growing crops and has poor structural property. According to local arid climate, the best utilization of the soil is as earthen construction material and it has been used for thousands of years. To research and improve the mechanical properties, the study investigates the response of soil with cement, lime, sand, and straw as admixtures to compressive loading. The influence on compressive strength and ductility of additives in different proportions is compared and analysed. The experimental data is also used for the formulation of dimensionless and generalized models describing the raw soil and modified soil’s full stress-strain response. The models can be applied to soil and <b>modified</b> soil in <b>Loess</b> Plateau with variable strength and deformation characteristics and therefore may be exploited for earthen construction design and nonlinear structural analyses...|$|R
40|$|Loess shoulder-lines are {{significant}} structural lines which divide the complicated loess landform into loess interfluves and gully-slope lands. Existing extraction algorithms for shoulder-lines mainly {{are based on}} local maximum of terrain features. These algorithms are sensitive to noise for complicated loess surface and the extraction parameters are difficult to be determined, making the extraction results usually inaccurate. This paper presents a new extraction approach for loess shoulder-lines, in which Marr-Hildreth edge operator is employed to construct initial shoulder-lines. Then the terrain mask for confining the boundary of shoulder-lines is proposed based on slope degree classification and morphology methods, avoiding interference from non-valley area and <b>modify</b> the initial <b>loess</b> shoulder-lines. A case study is conducted in Yijun located in the northern Shanxi Loess Plateau of China. The Digital Elevation Models with a grid size of 5 m is applied as original data. To obtain optimal scale parameters, the Euclidean Distance Offset Percentages between shoulder-lines is calculated by the Marr-Hildreth operator and the manual delineations. The experimental {{results show that the}} new method could achieve the highest extraction accuracy when σ = 5 in Gaussian smoothing. According to the accuracy assessment, the average extraction accuracy is about 88. 5 %, which indicates that the proposed method is applicable for the extraction of loess shoulder-lines in the loess hilly and gully areas...|$|R
