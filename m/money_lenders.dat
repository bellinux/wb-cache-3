5|$|Edward I's {{frequent}} military campaigns put a great financial {{strain on}} the nation. There were several ways through which the king could raise money for war, including customs duties, money lending and lay subsidies. In 1275, EdwardI negotiated {{an agreement with the}} domestic merchant community that secured a permanent duty on wool. In 1303, a similar agreement was reached with foreign merchants, in return for certain rights and privileges. The revenues from the customs duty were handled by the Riccardi, a group of bankers from Lucca in Italy. This was in return for their service as <b>money</b> <b>lenders</b> to the crown, which helped finance the Welsh Wars. When the war with France broke out, the French king confiscated the Riccardi's assets, and the bank went bankrupt. After this, the Frescobaldi of Florence took over the role as <b>money</b> <b>lenders</b> to the English crown.|$|E

25|$|The Indian {{money market}} is {{classified}} into the organised sector, comprising private, public and foreign-owned commercial banks and cooperative banks, together known as 'scheduled banks'; and the unorganised sector, which includes individual or family-owned indigenous bankers or <b>money</b> <b>lenders</b> and non-banking financial companies. The unorganised sector and microcredit are preferred over traditional banks in rural and sub-urban areas, especially for non-productive purposes such as short-term loans for ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|The {{change in}} the tenancy {{condition}} in the state through Operation Barga has brought some degree of economic stability among farmers. Unlike in other Indian states, West Bengal has hardly seen any farmer suicides or starvation deaths arising from crop failure. Operation Barga {{and the distribution of}} surplus land among the marginal, poor and backward castes have created a cushion against farmers committing suicide because of the fear of <b>money</b> <b>lenders</b> or landlords taking away all the produce.|$|E

Although named in a letter from Albany to Cardinal Accolti, Cardinal Protector for Scotland in Rome, Albany actually gave the commendatorship to the Earl of Lennox who in turn sold or gave his right to it to Stewart who then borrowed from <b>money</b> <b>lenders</b> in Paris to purchase the confirming papal bulls. Stewart received the temporalities of the abbey on 6 October 1526 until his death 1539.|$|E
25|$|Musa {{took out}} large loans from <b>money</b> <b>lenders</b> in Cairo before {{beginning}} his journey home.

Musa's hajj, and especially his gold, caught the attention of both the Islamic and Christian worlds. Consequently, the name of Mali and Timbuktu appeared on 14th century world maps.|$|E
25|$|In 1880, the Pathan {{population}} numbered around 1,000 in {{what was}} then British Ceylon.

Around 300 of them were based in Kandy, 100 in Trincomalee and Batticaloa, 150 in Colombo, and the remaining 450 in Jaffna, Kurunegala, Badulla, Haldummulla and Ratnapura districts. Patrick Peebles states that the Pathans were recognisable by their physical and facial features, their distinctive clothing and turbans, and were the subject of discriminatory usury laws. They were notable for their skills in sport, and usually lived together.|$|E

25|$|A 2012 study, did a {{regional}} survey on farmers suicide in rural Vidarbha (Maharashtra) and applied a Smith's Saliency method to qualitatively rank the expressed causes among farming families {{who had lost}} someone to suicide. The expressed reasons in order of importance behind farmer suicides were – debt, alcohol addiction, environment, low produce prices, stress and family responsibilities, apathy, poor irrigation, increased cost of cultivation, private <b>money</b> <b>lenders,</b> use of chemical fertilizers and crop failure. In other words, debt to stress and family responsibilities were rated as significantly higher than fertilizers and crop failure. In a different study in the same region in 2006, indebtedness (87%) and deterioration in the economic status (74%) {{were found to be}} major risk factors for suicide.|$|E
25|$|India has a large, low-income, rural {{population}} with {{limited access to}} formal banking facilities. This leads to teh absenc of two major helplines for poorer people - that of placing their money safely in deposits and secondly {{of being able to}} borrow money fr their needs which may be as simple as buying seeds for the next crop or their children's marriage. The second aim is achieved instead by a web of parallel, informal banking in the form of <b>money</b> <b>lenders</b> (pawn brokers) who have existed in India for a few centuries. At its centre are moneylenders, mostly unregulated, often also wealthy landlords or now politicians, used to charge exorbitant rates of interest. To curb this practice, several Moneylenders Acts were enacted by the State governments of India by the 1950s. However failure to replace the role of moneylenders gave rise to unscrupulous financial operators that operated Ponzi schemes. Some commentators place the blame for these kinds of Ponzi schemes on greed rather than exclusion from formal banking systems.|$|E
25|$|As the Hoa are {{inclined}} to be entrepreneurs, they have dominated several types of businesses such as selling rice, crewed junk, rice transportation, and ship building during their early arrival to Vietnam. Through enterprise, organization, and cooperation many Chinese became part of a prosperous, urban middle class that controlled retail trade. Chinese shops filled every town and sea route as rice selling and transportation remained {{one of the most}} profitable businesses in the nation. In addition, the Hoa became actively involved in commerce, particularly in the area of Saigon, where Chinese worked as vendors and sold an array of products as an industrious enterprising ethnic group. Many would then work as butchers and tailors, and then venture into confectionery. Many Chinese also worked as <b>money</b> <b>lenders,</b> bankers, and money changers. Products such as tea, porcelain, pharmaceuticals and medicine, furniture and cabinet-work were shipped to Vietnam from China. Government officials said the ethnic Chinese in Cholon were active in municipal interests and the Vietnamese Communist Party. But their main interest was enterprise. The Chinese feel secure in business as well as their social and cultural life. About 20 percent of the 6,000 private companies and 150,000 individual small businesses in the city were run by Chinese. The Chinese accounted for more than 30 percent of Ho Chi Minh City's business output due to better equipment used by the businesses.|$|E

500|$|Girdap's {{constituent}} assembly {{was held on}} 1 December 1881, less than {{four years after the}} Liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule and the establishment of the Principality of Bulgaria. At the time, the northeastern Bulgarian city of Ruse was a major economic hub. Ruse prospered due to its role as a major port on the Danube, its rapid industrial development and its well-established ties with Central Europe along that river. Banking, however, was a new concept, as most people employed the services of <b>money</b> <b>lenders</b> and entrusted their savings to people they knew personally. The founders of Girdap sought to [...] "liberate the population of money lenders", in the words of later bank director Boncho Boev. Due to an overall lack of capital in the country, interest rates of loans given by Girdap were nonetheless high: 15–18% as compared to the over 20–30% interest rate of <b>money</b> <b>lenders.</b> The bank officially commenced operations on 1 January 1882. It took its name from the Girdap neighbourhood of Ruse where the {{constituent assembly}} was held.|$|E

He advanced professionally through the patronage of the earls of Devon, and became Chamberlain of the Exchequer and steward of Isabella, Countess of Devon. At {{the same time}} he made himself an enormous fortune through moneylending, primarily by acquiring debts from Jewish moneylenders. His business methods were dubious, and often involved various illegal activities. In 1290 he fell victim to an investigation of corruption in the royal administration, and from 1292 until his deathno later than 1294he was held in prison.

2500|$|Historical records {{relating}} to frustration, revolts and high mortality rates among farmers in India, particularly cash crop farmers, {{date back to}} the 19th century. However, suicides due to the same were rare. The high land taxes of 1870s, payable in cash regardless of the effects of frequent famines on farm output or productivity, combined with colonial protection of usury, <b>money</b> <b>lenders</b> and landowner rights, contributed to widespread penury and frustration among cotton and other farmers, ultimately leading to the Deccan Riots of 1875-1877. The British government enacted the Deccan Agriculturists’ Relief Act in 1879, to limit the interest rate charged by <b>money</b> <b>lenders</b> to Deccan cotton farmers, but applied it selectively to areas that served British cotton trading interests. Rural mortality rates, in predominantly agrarian British India, were very high between 1850 and the 1940s. However, starvation related deaths far exceeded those by suicide, the latter being officially classified under [...] "injuries". The death rate classified under [...] "injuries", in 1897, was 79 per 100,000 people in Central Provinces of India and 37 per 100,000 people in Bombay Presidency.|$|E
