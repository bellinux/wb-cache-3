5|$|Meanwhile, Microsoft began {{introducing}} {{its most}} prominent office products. Microsoft Works, an integrated office program which combined features typically {{found in a}} word processor, spreadsheet, database and other office applications, saw its first release as an application for the Apple Macintosh {{towards the end of}} 1986. Microsoft Works would later be sold with other Microsoft products including Microsoft Word and Microsoft Bookshelf, a reference collection introduced in 1987 that was the company's first CD-ROM product. Later, on August 8, 1989, Microsoft introduced its most successful office product, <b>Microsoft</b> <b>Office.</b> Unlike the model of Microsoft Works, <b>Microsoft</b> <b>Office</b> was a bundle of separate office productivity applications, such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel and so forth. While Microsoft Word and <b>Microsoft</b> <b>Office</b> were mostly developed internally, Microsoft also continued its trend of rebranding products from other companies, such as Microsoft SQL Server on January 13, 1988, a relational database management system for companies that was based on technology licensed from Sybase.|$|E

5|$|During the {{transition}} from MS-DOS to Windows, the success of Microsoft's product <b>Microsoft</b> <b>Office</b> allowed the company to gain ground on application-software competitors, such as WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3. Novell, an owner of WordPerfect for a time, alleged that Microsoft used its inside knowledge of the DOS and Windows kernels and of undocumented Application Programming Interface features to make Office perform better than its competitors. Eventually, <b>Microsoft</b> <b>Office</b> became the dominant business suite, with a market share far exceeding that of its competitors. In March 1992, Microsoft released Windows 3.1 along with its first promotional campaign on TV; the software sold over three million copies in its first two months on the market. In October, Windows for Workgroups 3.1 was released with integrated networking abilities such as peer-to-peer file and printing sharing. In November, Microsoft released {{the first version of}} their popular database software Microsoft Access.|$|E

5|$|Bob Muglia was {{influential}} in a corporate restructuring at Microsoft in 1999, which assigned business divisions to customer types, rather than technologies. As {{part of the}} re-structuring, Muglia became head of the business-productivity group, which oversaw <b>Microsoft</b> <b>Office,</b> Exchange and other business software. According to Computer Reseller News, Muglia pushed developers to visit customers, created customer advisory boards and led other efforts to incorporate customer input into product development at Microsoft.|$|E

5|$|Integration with <b>Microsoft</b> <b>Office</b> 365 and Microsoft Azure {{were added}} in 2014. That October the Account Map tool was introduced, which uses an {{algorithm}} {{to visualize the}} flow of work across groups of employees. In August 2014, version 2.0 of the Smartsheet iOS app was introduced. It made a spreadsheet-like user interface {{the focus of the}} app's user interface, whereas previously the mobile interface was different than the spreadsheet-oriented desktop version.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Smartsheet started {{introducing}} closer integrations with <b>Microsoft</b> <b>Office</b> products, in part {{thanks to}} changes Microsoft was making in {{their products to}} work better with third-party software. In January 2015, Smartsheet added support for Microsoft's identity management software Azure Active Directory, which allowed users to log into products like Excel and Smartsheet with the same login. Users can also now make changes to smartsheets directly from Microsoft Outlook. In 2016 Smartsheet introduced Sights, a configurable dashboard that shows metrics such as how a team is performing against key performance indicators.|$|E
5|$|Most {{versions}} of Windows Mobile have a standard set of features, such as multitasking {{and the ability}} to navigate a file system similar to that of Windows 9x and Windows NT, including support for many of the same file types. Similarly to its desktop counterpart, it comes bundled with a set of applications that perform basic tasks. Internet Explorer Mobile is the default web browser, and Windows Media Player is the default media player used for playing digital media. The mobile version of <b>Microsoft</b> <b>Office,</b> is the default office suite.|$|E

5|$|The final Delrina-branded {{version of}} WinFax was WinFax PRO 7.0, which shipped in late 1995, the {{subsequent}} version 8.0 being a Symantec product. There was no intervening version 5.0 or 6.0, and the jump to version 7.0 was purely a marketing decision, based on {{keeping up with}} the suite of products in <b>Microsoft</b> <b>Office</b> which were then at the same number. It also reflected the development effort required to develop the first full 32-bit application version, designed to work with the Windows 95 operating system, which set it apart from its competition at the time.|$|E
5|$|This {{initial release}} had {{multiple}} built-in applications, {{many of them}} similarly branded to match their desktop counterparts; such as Microsoft Reader, Microsoft Money, Pocket Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player. A version of <b>Microsoft</b> <b>Office</b> called Pocket Office was also bundled and included Pocket Word, Pocket Excel and Pocket Outlook. Notes, a note-taking app saw its first release and would be supported by most later versions of Windows Mobile. Intelligent character recognition support allowed Notes to distinguish styles of handwriting to be learned by the OS during processing to improve accuracy and recognition levels.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft is an American public {{multinational}} corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington, USA that develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports {{a wide range}} of products and services predominantly related to computing through its various product divisions. Established on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800, Microsoft rose to dominate the home computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems. Microsoft would also come to dominate the office suite market with <b>Microsoft</b> <b>Office.</b> The company has diversified in recent years into the video game industry with the Xbox, the Xbox 360, and the Xbox One, as well as into the consumer electronics and digital services market with Zune, MSN and the Windows Phone OS.|$|E

5|$|While {{extremely}} popular in Britain, {{and to a}} lesser extent in European printing, Gill Sans did not achieve popularity with American printers in the hot metal era, with most preferring gothic designs like Franklin Gothic and geometric designs like Futura and Monotype's own Twentieth Century. Gill Sans therefore particularly achieved worldwide popularity after the close of the metal type era and in the phototypesetting and digital era, when it became a system font on Macintosh computers and <b>Microsoft</b> <b>Office.</b> One use of Gill's work in the United States in this period, however, was a custom wordmark and logo made by Gill for Poetry magazine in 1930 based on Gill Sans. Its editor Harriet Monroe had seen Gill's work in London.|$|E
5|$|While Microsoft largely {{failed to}} {{participate}} in the rise of the Internet in the early 1990s, some of the key technologies in which the company had invested to enter the Internet market started to pay off by the mid-90s. One of the most prominent of these was ActiveX, an application programming interface built on the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM); this enabled Microsoft and others to embed controls in many programming languages, including the company's own scripting languages, such as JScript and VBScript. ActiveX included frameworks for documents and server solutions. The company also released the Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, which had built-in support for internet applications. Later in 1997, <b>Microsoft</b> <b>Office</b> 97 as well as Internet Explorer 4.0 were released, marking the beginning of the takeover of the browser market from rival Netscape, and by agreement with Apple Computer, Internet Explorer was bundled with the Apple Macintosh operating system as well as with Windows. Windows CE 2.0, the handheld version of Windows, was released this year, including a host of bug fixes and new features designed to make it more appealing to corporate customers. In October, the Justice Department filed a motion in the federal district court in which they stated that Microsoft had violated an agreement signed in 1994, and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.|$|E
