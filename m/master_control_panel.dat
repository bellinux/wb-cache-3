5000|$|The general {{method of}} {{creating}} the shortcuts is documented by Microsoft, though Microsoft had not publicized the specific GUID [...] for the <b>Master</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Panel.</b> Third parties have published the method since at least 2007 under the more modest title “Hack VISTA - All Control Panel & Setting tasks at one place”. Numerous blogs and tweets on the subject appeared in December 2009 and January 2010 as “Windows 7 Godmode”, with many sites repeating the same information available elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|The Windows <b>Master</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Panel</b> shortcut, labeled All Tasks {{and also}} called Windows God Mode by bloggers and All Tasks folder {{by at least}} one Microsoft developer, is a {{short-cut}} to access various control settings in Windows Vista and later operating systems, including Windows 10. By creating a folder with a certain name, users have access to all of the operating system's control panels from within a single folder. The hack was published outside of Microsoft documentation in 2007 and gained popularity when the name God Mode was used by bloggers. Variations of the same method can access different settings, and have also been called “God Mode” folders.|$|E
50|$|The MAFFS {{consists}} {{of a series of}} five pressurized fire retardant tanks with a total capacity of 2,700 gal and associated equipment which is palletized and carried in the aircraft's cargo bay. In addition to the retardant tanks, each module contains a pressure tank where compressed air is stored at 82.7 bar (1200 psi). The control module includes the <b>master</b> <b>control</b> <b>panel,</b> the loadmaster's seat, and discharge valves. An air compressor module provides air pressure for charging the system; it stays at the airtanker base during air operations and is used to recharge the system between runs. Each unit weighs about 11,000 lb. It can be installed in any C-130-E or -H equipped with the USAF 463L cargo-handling system.|$|E

5000|$|The {{functionality}} {{that was}} discovered and named <b>Master</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Panel</b> or God Mode {{was designed as}} the base folder for searching control panel options using the new start menu's search function. This allows users to type {{what they want to}} do (e. g. “Change screen resolution”) and they will get the right control panel options as search result. The shortcut is implemented by creating a folder with the extension, “” (without quotes). GodMode was the original folder name used when the feature was publicised, but any name can be used. The same functionality can be achieved by creating a standard Windows shortcut with the path “” or by creating a [...] file in a folder that includes the extension's CLSID (Class ID).|$|E
50|$|In appearance, the Jaguar Bass / Jaguar Deluxe Bass {{is largely}} {{faithful}} to the original Fender Jaguar, with exception of the neck, bridge, and pickups taken from the Fender Jazz Bass. Rather than the standard dot position markers, however, the Jaguar bass has aged pearloid block inlays, a feature generally reserved for premium instruments. The bass also has a standard vintage-style top-loading bridge and tuners. An onboard preamp is controlled by bass/treble boost rollers and an on/off switch located on the top control panel. The lower control panel holds on/off switches {{for each of the}} pickups, and a switch to toggle between parallel and series wiring of the pickups. Finally, the <b>master</b> <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> holds the master volume, master tone, and jack. Other features include an alder body, C-shaped maple neck, 7.25"-radius rosewood fretboard with 20 medium jumbo frets.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-This paper {{proposes a}} third {{generation}} teleoperation {{system based on}} a status driven slave symbolically instructed by the <b>master</b> <b>control</b> <b>panel.</b> Furthering the first-generation joint-angle control techniques and second-generation coordinate transformation techniques, this system recognizes the target status specified by the operator by extracting the task status from visual sensors. The task environment is initially described via sensing points in the work environment and on the manipulated object. The relationships between the sensing points and the change of those relationships describes the task at hand. Operation can proceed in automatic mode where the system completely directs the slave or in shared mode where the system assists the operator by constraining the slave motion while the operator directs via a visual communication interface. Although status driven techniques offer several improvements in teleoperated control, this work explores the robustness and reliability provided in dynamic workspace environments. One successful application of this technique is in micrometer scale part handling, the so-called ‘microworld assembly ’ where an operator’s past experience in the macro world is not applicable to the physics experienced in the microworld. 1...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} a concepts, guidelines, a toolset {{and experiences}} with defining and implementing on-line visual displays of software development progress, <b>control</b> <b>panels.</b> <b>Control</b> <b>panels</b> group sets of measurement visualizations providing a multi-dimensional, integrated view of development status. <b>Control</b> <b>panels</b> are developed at various organizational levels, serving the information needs of different stakeholders. Navigation between different <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> enables users to drill down to view more detailed information on, e. g., a particular project {{or on the}} progress of a particular development activity. In the constructive part of the work, I describe concepts, and a toolset {{that can be used for}} defining and implementing <b>control</b> <b>panels.</b> In addition, I provide guidelines for grouping measures into <b>control</b> <b>panels,</b> and discuss how measurement programs can be partitioned into <b>control</b> <b>panels.</b> The toolset, built as a "proof-of-concept" consists of a central measurement database, a visualization client, and a set of data importers that transfer data from external corporate repositories into the measurement database. The empirical part discusses our efforts to define and implement <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> in four high-technology companies in Finland. Framed in the context of "constructive action research", the cases are first described individually, according to the main steps of the action research cycle, then compared in a cross-case analysis. Our results—we succeeded in implementing <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> in only one of four organizations—indicate that the development of <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> requires a substantial investment and commitment by the organization, but that it can be feasible even in small organizations. The main obstacles hindering the implementation were organizational and human in nature, and more related to measurement program implementation in general than to tool support per se. Interestingly, the organizations did not consider measurement definition, i. e., the selection of "metrics" to be problematic. Success factors identified included management commitment, dedicated measurement personnel, and organizational change management. While limited, our experiences with the use of <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> show that they were felt to be more valuable by management than by the collocated project personnel. We thus hypothesise that the usefulness of <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> increases with project size and geographical distance. In the future it would be interesting to develop <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> for distributed software development projects, in which informal status communication is more difficult. reviewe...|$|R
