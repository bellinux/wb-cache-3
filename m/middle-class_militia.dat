50|$|The station {{opened on}} 1 March 1909 {{with the opening}} of the {{original}} section of line 6 from Place d'Italie to Nation (although part of line 5—some dating back to 2 October 1900—was incorporated into line 6 on 12 October 1942). It is named after the Rue Nationale, which commemorates the National Guard. This was a <b>middle-class</b> <b>militia</b> created on 13 July 1789 for the maintenance of law and order in Paris. Next day, it took part in the storming of the Bastille.|$|E

Merchants were forbidden to bring commercial goods or beer into Brussels, thus allowing their transport capacities to be used to supply the city. Brussels appealed to other Brabantian cities, such as Leuven, Antwerp and Mechelen to send aid, which was done immediately, and convoys of food were hired and sent as soon as possible. The numerous residents without shelter camped in the palace's park. Authorities requisitioned what space they could in waiting for reconstruction, and rent increases were forbidden throughout the city. To put an end to looting and re-establish order, the city formed <b>middle-class</b> <b>militias</b> charged with patrolling the disaster-stricken areas. Max Emanuel posted sentries day and night, before joining in the siege of Namur.|$|R
50|$|Thus, the {{division}} emerged between the Orangists, {{who supported the}} stadtholder, and the Patriots who, inspired by {{the ideals of the}} Enlightenment, desired a more democratic government and a more equal society. The Patriots built support from most of the <b>middle-class,</b> and founded <b>militias</b> (Exercitiegenootschappen) of armed civilians, which between 1783 and 1787 managed to take over several cities and regions in an effort to force new elections which would oust the old government officials. The Patriots held Holland and the city of Utrecht, while the Orangists held the states of Guelders and Utrecht (without the capital city).|$|R
