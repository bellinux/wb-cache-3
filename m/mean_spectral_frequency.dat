Previous studies have shown poor agreement between these two methods when measuring myocardial velocities and displacement. In this study, the concordance between the myocardial velocity and displacement measurements using colour TD and different spectral TD procedures was evaluated. Methods Left ventricular (LV) longitudinal systolic myocardial velocities and displacement during ejection period were quantified at the basal septal and lateral wall in 24 healthy individuals (4 women and 20 men, 34 ± 12 years) using spectral TD, colour TD and M-mode recordings. Mean, maximal and minimal spectral TD systolic velocities and the corresponding displacement values were obtained by measurements at the outer and inner borders of the spectral velocity signal. The results were then compared with those obtained with the two other modalities used. Results Systolic myocardial velocities derived from <b>mean</b> <b>spectral</b> TD <b>frequencies</b> were highly concordant with corresponding colour TD measurements (mean difference 0. 10 ± 0. 54 cm/sec in septal and 0. 09 ± 0. 97 cm/sec in lateral wall). Similarly, the agreement between spectral and colour TD (mean difference 0. 22 ± 0. 74 mm in septal and 0. 02 ± 0. 86 mm in lateral wall) as well as M-mode was good when <b>mean</b> <b>spectral</b> velocities were temporally integrated and the results did not differ statistically. Conversely, displacement values from the inner or outer border of the spectral signal differed significantly from values obtained with colour TD and M-mode (p Conclusion LV systolic myocardial measurements based on <b>mean</b> <b>spectral</b> TD <b>frequencies</b> are highly concordant with those provided by colour TD and M-mode.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the effect of {{ischemia}} on low-threshold motor unit conduction velocity. Nine subjects were trained to isolate the activity of a single motor unit (target motor unit) in the abductor pollicis brevis muscle with feedback on surface EMG signals recorded with a 16 -electrode linear array. After training, the subjects activated the target motor unit at approximately 8 pulses per second (pps) for five 3 -min-long contractions. During the third and fourth contractions, a cuff inflated at 180 mmHg around the forearm induced ischemia of the hand. The exerted force (mean +/- SE, 4. 6 +/- 2. 1 % of the maximal voluntary contraction force), discharge rate (8. 6 +/- 0. 4 pps), interpulse interval variability (34. 8 +/- 2. 5 %), and peak-to-peak amplitude of the target motor unit action potentials (176. 6 +/- 18. 2 microV) were not different among the five contractions. Conduction velocity, <b>mean</b> power <b>spectral</b> <b>frequency,</b> and action potential duration were the same in the beginning of the five contractions (2. 8 +/- 0. 2 m/s, 195. 2 +/- 10. 5 Hz, and 5. 4 +/- 0. 3 ms, respectively) and changed over the 3 min of sustained activation only during the fourth contraction. Conduction velocity and <b>mean</b> power <b>spectral</b> <b>frequency</b> decreased (10. 05 +/- 1. 8 % and 8. 50 +/- 2. 18 % during the 3 min, respectively) and action potential duration increased (8. 2 +/- 4. 6 % in the 3 min) during the fourth contraction. In conclusion, 1) subjects were able to isolate the activity of a single motor unit with surface EMG visual feedback in ischemic conditions maintained for 16 min, and 2) the activation-induced decrease in single motor unit conduction velocity was significantly larger with ischemia than with normal circulation, probably due to the alteration of mechanisms of ion exchange across the fiber membran...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} a novel {{approach}} to realtime muscular fatigue detection is presented. Surface ElectroMyoGraphy (sEMG) {{has been used to}} monitor muscles work and in particular to detect signs of muscular fatigue. The joint estimation of a pair of electrical indicators (i. e. amplitude and <b>mean</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>frequency</b> of sEMG signal) is the basis for the detection of the muscular status, since their values are strictly influenced by different conditions of force production and fatigue occurrence. These indicators are estimated by adaptive algorithms specifically devised to process signals recorded during either static or dynamic conditions. The algorithms allow real-time processing and are integrated into a single monitor for muscular status. The monitor has been tested on signals recorded during spinning training sessions. Ten able body subjects volunteered for these sessions composed of several tasks characterized by different body postures and flying wheel resistances. A movement analysis system (StepPC©, DEMItaly), has been used to record cardiac activity, sEMG signal from rectus femoris and angular displacement at knee joint.

The values of MVC were recorded for both legs three times on each day and for three subsequent days, while the EMG signals have been recorded twice a day for three subsequent days. The degree of repeatability was investigated using the Fisher test based upon the ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA), the Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Data collected showed {{a high level of}} repeatability of MVC measurement (normalized SEM from 1. 1 % to 6. 4 % of the mean). MNF and ARV initial values also showed a high level of repeatability (ICC > 70 % for all muscles and legs except right VMO). At 50 % MVC level no relevant pattern of fatigue was observed for the VMO and VL muscles, suggesting that other portions of the quadriceps might have contributed to the generated effort. These observations seem to suggest that in the investigation of muscles belonging to a multi-muscular group at submaximal level, the more selective electrically elicited contractions should be preferred to voluntary contractions.

40|$|Wind-generated surface {{gravity wave}} heights and periods are non {{observable}} variables. Notwithstanding {{their role in}} sea environment characterization and consequently in ocean and coastal engineering design criteria is crucial. Discrete waves and the associated heights and periods are defined from sea surface elevations time series. These wind driven sea surface oscillations are random and each record of this displacement (whatever the sensor used) is a realisation of a stochastic process. A new criterion, called orbital criterion, to define discrete waves from continuous records is presented. The method uses the Hilbert Transform and {{the representation of the}} time series in the complex plane. A discrete wave corresponds to a 2 #pi# phase-advance in the complex plane. The waves between zero crossings which do not show a 2 #pi# phase-advance are considered false waves. It has the advantage of not introducing additional arbitrary constraints, which has been a common practice in most past wave studies, and therefore allowing uniformity of estimates and comparisons of statistical characterizations of ocean waves. The new method was used to analysed field data measured off the west coast of Portugal (Figueira da Foz). According to the theoretical relationship between statistical and descriptions, deduced for the orbital criterion, an equality between the mean period of orbital waves and the inverse of the <b>mean</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>frequency</b> was observed.

The algorithm was adapted to the EMG characteristics and tested on both simulated and experimental signals. The coding parameters selected led to a compression ratio of 87. 3 %. For simulated signals, the mean square error in signal reconstruction and the percentage error in average rectified value after compression were 11. 2 % and 4. 90 %, respectively.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to explore changes in the spatial {{distribution}} of erector spinae electromyography amplitude during static, sustained contractions and during contractions of increasing load. Surface electromyographic (EMG) signals were detected from nine healthy subjects using a grid of 13 x 5 electrodes placed unilaterally over the lumbar erector spinae musculature. Subjects stood in a 20 degrees forward flexed position and performed: (1) six 20 -s long contractions with loads ranging from 2. 5 kg to 12. 5 kg (2. 5 kg increments) and (2) a 6 min sustained contraction with 7. 5 kg load. Root mean square (RMS) and <b>mean</b> power <b>spectral</b> <b>frequency</b> (MNF) were computed from the recorded EMG signals. EMG RMS increased (P < 0. 0001) and MNF remained constant during contractions of increased load. During the sustained contraction, MNF decreased (P < 0. 0001) and RMS did not change over time. The centroid (center of activity) of the RMS map shifted caudally (P < 0. 0001) with time during the sustained contraction but did not change with varying load. These results suggest a change in the distribution of erector spinae muscle activity with fatigue and a uniform distribution of muscle activation across loads. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated coupling between epileptiform spike phase and ripple amplitude to better understand the mechanisms that generate this type of pathologic ripple (pRipple) event. Methods: We quantified phase amplitude coupling (PAC) between epileptiform electroencephalography (EEG) spike phase and ripple amplitude recorded from intracranial depth macroelectrodes during episodes of sleep in 12 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. PAC was determined by (1) a phasor transform that corresponds to the strength and rate of ripples coupled with spikes, and a (2) ripple-triggered average to measure the strength, morphology, and <b>spectral</b> <b>frequency</b> of the modulating and modulated signals. Coupling strength was evaluated in relation to recording sites within and outside the seizure-onset zone (SOZ). Results: Both the phasor transform and ripple-triggered averaging methods showed that ripple amplitude was often robustly coupled with epileptiform EEG spike phase. Coupling was found more regularly inside than outside the SOZ, and coupling strength correlated with the likelihood a macroelectrode's location was within the SOZ (p < 0. 01). The ratio of the rate of ripples coupled with EEG spikes inside the SOZ to rates of coupled ripples in non-SOZ was greater than the ratio of rates of ripples on spikes detected irrespective of coupling (p < 0. 05). Coupling strength correlated with an increase in mean normalized ripple amplitude (p < 0. 01), and a decrease in <b>mean</b> ripple <b>spectral</b> <b>frequency</b> (p < 0. 05). Significance: Generation of low-frequency (80 – 150 Hz) pRipples in the SOZ involves coupling between epileptiform spike phase and ripple amplitude.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of high degrees of motor unit synchronization on surface EMG variables extracted by linear and non-linear analysis techniques. For this purpose, spectral and recurrent quantification analysis (RQA) were applied to both simulated and experimental EMG signals. Synthetic surface EMG signals were generated with a model of volume conductor comprising muscle, fat, and skin tissues. The synchronization was quantified by the percent of discharges of each motor unit synchronized with discharges of other motor units. The simulated signals presented degrees of synchronization in the range 0 - 80 % (10 % increments) and three mean values of motor unit conduction velocity distribution (3, 4 and 5 m/s). Experimental signals were collected from the first dorsal interosseous muscle of five patients with Parkinson disease during 10 s of rest and 10 s of isometric voluntary contraction at 50 % of the maximal force. <b>Mean</b> power <b>spectral</b> <b>frequency</b> (MNF) and percent of determinism (%DET) of the surface EMG were computed from the simulated and experimental signals. In the simulated signals, %DET was linearly related to the level of synchronization in the entire range considered while MNF was sensitive to changes in synchronization in a smaller range (0 - 20 %), outside which it levelled off. The experimental results indicated that %DET was significantly higher in the resting condition (with presence of tremor; mean S. E., 85. 4 +/- 0. 8 %) than during the voluntary contraction (which partly suppressed tremor; 60. 0 +/- 2. 3 %; P < 0. 01). On the contrary, MNF did not depend on the condition (114. 3 +/- 1. 5 Hz and 118. 0 +/- 0. 8 Hz for the resting and voluntary contraction, respectively), confirming the simulation results. Overall, these results indicated that linear and non-linear analyses of the surface EMG may have different sensitivities to the underlying physiological mechanisms in specific conditions, thus their joint use provides a more complete view of the muscle status than spectral analysis only.

This study aimed to investigate the influence of inter-electrode distance (IED) and contraction modality (step-wise vs. ramp) on the changes in <b>spectral</b> <b>frequencies</b> with increasing contraction strength for the vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus medialis (VM) muscles. METHODS: Twenty healthy male volunteers were assessed for isometric sEMG activity of the VM and VL, with the knee at 90 ° flexion. Subjects performed isometric ramp contractions in knee extension (6 -s duration) with the force gradually increasing from 0 to 80  % MVC. Also, subjects performed 4 -s step-wise isometric contractions at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80  % MVC. Interference sEMG signals were recorded simultaneously at different IEDs: 10, 20, 30, and 50  mm. The mean (F mean) and median (F median) frequencies and root mean square (RMS) of sEMG signals were calculated. RESULTS: For all IEDs, contraction modalities, and muscles tested, <b>spectral</b> <b>frequencies</b> increased significantly with increasing level of force up to 50 - 60  % MVC force. Spectral indexes increased systematically as IED was decreased. The sensitivity of <b>spectral</b> <b>frequencies</b> to changes in contraction force was independent of IED. The behaviour of spectral indexes with increasing contraction force was similar for step-wise and ramp contractions. CONCLUSIONS: In the VL and VM muscles, {{it is highly unlikely}} that a particular inter-electrode distance or contraction modality could have prevented the observation of the full extent of the increase in <b>spectral</b> <b>frequencies</b> with increasing force level...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Approximate entropy, {{a measure}} of signal {{complexity}} and regularity, quantifies electroencephalogram changes during anesthesia. With increasing doses of anesthetics, burst-suppression patterns occur. Because of the high-frequency bursts, spectrally based parameters such as median electroencephalogram <b>frequency</b> and <b>spectral</b> edge <b>frequency</b> 95 do not decrease, incorrectly suggesting lightening of anesthesia. The authors investigated whether the approximate entropy algorithm correctly classifies the occurrence of burst suppression as deepening of anesthesia. METHODS: Eleven female patients scheduled for elective major surgery were studied. After propofol induction, anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane only. Before surgery, the end-tidal isoflurane concentration was varied between 0. 6 and 1. 3 minimum alveolar concentration. The raw electroencephalogram was continuously recorded and sampled at 128 Hz. Approximate entropy, electroencephalogram median <b>frequency,</b> <b>spectral</b> edge <b>frequency</b> 95, burst-suppression ratio, and burst-compensated <b>spectral</b> edge <b>frequency</b> 95 were calculated offline from 8 -s epochs. The relation between burst-suppression ratio and approximate entropy, electroencephalogram median <b>frequency,</b> <b>spectral</b> edge <b>frequency</b> 95, and burst-compensated <b>spectral</b> edge <b>frequency</b> 95 was analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Higher isoflurane concentrations were associated with higher burst-suppression ratios. Electroencephalogram median frequency (r = 0. 34) and <b>spectral</b> edge <b>frequency</b> 95 (r = 0. 29) increased, approximate entropy (r = - 0. 94) and burst-compensated <b>spectral</b> edge <b>frequency</b> 95 (r = - 0. 88) decreased with increasing burst-suppression ratio. CONCLUSION: Electroencephalogram approximate entropy, but not electroencephalogram median <b>frequency</b> or <b>spectral</b> edge <b>frequency</b> 95 without burst compensation, correctly classifies the occurrence of burst-suppression pattern as increasing anesthetic drug effect. status: publishe...|$|R
