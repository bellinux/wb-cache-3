5|$|A wet bell, or open bell, {{is similar}} to a diving stage in concept, but has an air space, open to the water at the bottom in which the divers, or at least their heads, can shelter during ascent and descent. A wet bell {{provides}} more comfort and control than a stage and allows for longer time in the water. Wet bells are used for air and <b>mixed</b> <b>gas,</b> and divers can decompress using oxygen from a mask at 12m.|$|E
5|$|The thermal {{diffusion}} process was based on Sydney Chapman and David Enskog's theory, which explained that when a <b>mixed</b> <b>gas</b> passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier one tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter one at the warm end. Since hot gases tend to rise and cool ones tend to fall, this {{can be used as}} a means of isotope separation. This process was first demonstrated by H. Clusius and G. Dickel in Germany in 1938. It was developed by US Navy scientists, but was not one of the enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project. This was primarily due to doubts about its technical feasibility, but the inter-service rivalry between the Army and Navy also played a part.|$|E

25|$|Gas {{flow rates}} are usually {{controlled}} by an industrial gas regulator on the cylinder, {{and may be}} measured by an industrial flow meter. Measurement of flow rate can be a substitute for analysis of the <b>mixed</b> <b>gas,</b> but is generally less accurate in predicting the delivered mixture due to variations in temperature and gas delivery efficiency of the compressor, which may vary as the delivery pressure changes.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mixed</b> <b>gas</b> must be {{analysed}} before use, as an inaccurate {{assumption of}} composition {{can lead to}} problems of hypoxia or oxygen toxicity {{in the case of}} the oxygen analysis, and decompression sickness if the inert gas components differ from the planned composition. Analysis of oxygen fraction is usually done using an electro-galvanic fuel cell sensor, whereas helium fraction is usually done by a heat transfer comparison between the analysed gas and a standard sample.|$|E

40|$|The {{influences}} of humidity and temperature, which {{were considered to}} be the operating room condition, upon the explosiveness of ether gas and cyclopropane were studied concerning the minimum ignition energy. The results were as follows: 1) The curve of minimum ignition energy of the <b>mixed</b> <b>gases</b> of ether or cyclopropane with the air was estimated by the intensity of primary electric current of an induction coil, which was used for spark discharge. 2) When the temperature of the <b>mixed</b> <b>gases</b> of ether or cyclopropane with the air raised, the minimum ignition energy became less, and more explosive. On this result, the most optimum temperature of the operating room, for the precaution against ignition and also for clinical necessity, was quantatively considered to be from 18 °C to 24 °C. 3) The minimum ignition energy was less in case of higher humidity of the <b>mixed</b> <b>gases</b> of ether or cyclopropane with the air than in case of lower humidity, namely it became more explosive. To keep the humidity for the purpose of preventing against the generation of the static electricity {{is more important than the}} problem of the minimum ignition energy, so that the relative humidity of 60 % is to be the most optimum humidity of the operating room for precaution against explosion...|$|R

2500|$|Lightweight demand helmets are rigid {{structures}} which fully enclose {{the head}} of the diver and supply breathing gas [...] "on demand". The flow of gas from the supply line is activated by inhalation reducing the pressure in the helmet to slightly below ambient, and a diaphragm in the demand valve senses this pressure difference and moves a lever to open the valve to allow breathing gas to flow into the helmet. This flow continues until the pressure inside the helmet again balances the ambient pressure and the lever returns to the shut position. This is exactly the same principle as used for scuba demand valves, and in some cases the same components are used. Sensitivity of the lever can often be adjusted by the diver by turning a knob {{on the side of the}} demand valve. Lightweight demand helmets are available in open circuit systems (used when breathing standard air) and closed circuit (reclaim) systems (which may be used in order to reduce costs when breathing <b>mixed</b> <b>gas</b> such as heliox and trimix: the exhaled gas is returned to the surface, scrubbed of carbon dioxide, re-oxygenated, and returned to the diver).|$|E
