5|$|From 1980 to 1992 Raël and his {{movement}} became increasingly global. In 1980 Claude Raël's fifth Raëlian book Sensual Meditation was published and formal {{publication of the}} Raëlian <b>Messages</b> <b>in</b> the Japanese language began {{as part of the}} Raëlian mission to Japan. Two years later, Africa became another target area in the mission to spread the Raëlian messages.|$|E
5|$|Another seven internees were {{executed}} by the Japanese authorities. These internees had possessed a radio set which they used to pass <b>messages</b> <b>in</b> and out of camp. The radio was discovered by the Japanese and the internees were arrested. The other internees were forced to watch their public torture. Military trials were subsequently held and on 29 October 1943, some of the internees {{were executed}} by being shot and at least one, John Fraser, was beheaded. Aside from this, the Japanese authorities had executed by decapitation, three Chinese policemen for bringing cigarettes and tobacco to the camp's internees.|$|E

50|$|In 1964, Eugene Nida {{described}} translation {{as having}} {{two different types}} of equivalence: formal and dynamic equivalence. Formal equivalence is when there is focus on the <b>message</b> itself, <b>in</b> both form and content. The <b>message</b> <b>in</b> the target language should match the <b>message</b> <b>in</b> the source language as closely as possible. In contrast, there is less concern with matching the <b>message</b> <b>in</b> the target language with the <b>message</b> <b>in</b> the source language in dynamic equivalence. The goal is, however, to produce the same relationship between target text and target audience, as there was with the original source text and its audience.|$|R

5|$|As {{computers}} {{offered more}} advanced user interfaces, such as windows and point-and-click menus, many traditional roguelikes were modified to include support for having multiple windows. This was useful {{to not only}} show the character-based dungeon, but details on the character's inventory, the monster they were in battle with, and other status <b>messages,</b> <b>in</b> separate windows. Having access to multiple windows also allowed having menus to complete more complex commands.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the second}} leg, Ridsdale took out {{advertisements}} in British newspapers calling for calm, with the <b>messages</b> <b>in</b> the adverts also being translated into Turkish. Despite this, West Yorkshire Police warned local Turkish businesses to close early. When Galatasaray officials arrived at Elland Road {{for the second}} leg, hundreds of Leeds fans attacked the coach busses that were carrying them which delayed the kick-off of the second leg. During the first minute of the match, Leeds fans {{turned their backs on}} the match in protest of, what was viewed as, a lack of justice.|$|E
5|$|Bungie first {{introduced}} the Halo series publicly in 1999 by sending the Cortana Letters, {{a series of}} cryptic email messages, to the maintainer of marathon.bungie.org, a fan site for one of Bungie's previous series, the Marathon Trilogy. The strategic use of cryptic <b>messages</b> <b>in</b> a publicity campaign was repeated in I Love Bees, a promotion for Halo 2. Although Bungie does not consider most of the letters to be canon, Cortana speaks {{many of the same}} lines in Halo 3. According to C. J. Cowan, Bungie's director of cinematics, the studio used the character here to give story clues without actually revealing the story.|$|E

5|$|In 1985 Sinclair {{developed}} the ZX Spectrum 128 (code-named Derby) {{in conjunction with}} their Spanish distributor Investrónica.

5|$|In {{response}} to Hitler's reprimand, Goebbels {{launched a campaign}} to promote the antisemitic views of the Nazis to the German populace. He ordered each film studio to make an antisemitic film. Hitler preferred films such as Der ewige Jude which presented the Nazi antisemitic agenda openly and directly; however Goebbels disliked the crudeness of such straight-forward approaches, preferring the much more subtle approach of couching antisemitic <b>messages</b> <b>in</b> an engaging story with popular appeal.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It serves as a satire of pop culture criticism, and mocks people who find hidden <b>messages</b> <b>in</b> works which are ironically unnecessary. The episode includes other themes, including the lack of interest in reading among American youths, and even mocks the idea that a book alone can inspire someone into committing violent crimes.|$|E
5|$|The public outcry, {{anticipated}} by the {{consultancy report}} for the Antiquities and Monuments Office, was to become reality. With the imminent threat of demolition, the local community rallied to save pier, to widespread media coverage.

5|$|As had {{happened}} during the Kokoda Track campaign and the Battle of Buna–Gona, estimates by Australian intelligence differed greatly from those at GHQ, as they used different methods. The intelligence staff at Blamey's Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ), headed by Brigadier J. D. Rogers, {{had come up with}} a much higher figure of 3,000. I Corps produced an estimate of 1,800, which was passed on along with GHQ's estimate. The Allies' best source of intelligence, Ultra, shone no light on the matter. Finschhafen was mentioned in only five decrypted <b>messages</b> <b>in</b> the previous three months. Most of these were in the insecure Japanese Water Transport Code. Only after the capture of Japanese codebooks in the Battle of Sio in January 1944 were the Allies able to systematically break into the Japanese Army codes. In fact, Japanese strength in the area on 22 September was about 5,000.|$|E

5000|$|The medium Rosina Thompson was {{described}} as a British counterpart to Piper. [...] After the death of Frederic Myers in 1901, Piper claimed to receive messages from Myers for his widow. The messages were warnings that Thompson was a fraudulent medium. Before his death Myers had left a <b>message</b> <b>in</b> a sealed envelope; Piper's control did not reveal the <b>message.</b> <b>In</b> 1906 the Myers control was completely baffled when given a <b>message</b> <b>in</b> Latin by a séance sitter, and took three months to get the meaning of the message. This was unlike Myers, as whilst alive he was a classicist who knew Latin.|$|R

5|$|Before {{moving over}} the mountains, the 20th Division {{headquarters}} elected to destroy its cryptographic materials rather than carry them. As the wet weather made burning them page by page {{a slow and}} difficult process, and a fire might {{attract the attention of}} the Allied Air Forces, someone decided to simply bury them in a steel trunk in a stream bed. An Australian sapper checking the stream bed for booby traps with a metal detector discovered it, and it was dug up in the belief that it was a mine. An intelligence officer recognised the contents as code books and soon it {{was on its way to}} the Central Bureau in Brisbane. There, the pages were carefully dried out and photographed. On 4 February 1944, Central Bureau codebreakers decrypted a thirteen-part message that laid out the decisions reached at a conference of high-ranking Japanese officers. Copies of the material were quickly sent to Arlington Hall. In January 1944, Arlington Hall had decrypted 1,846 Japanese army <b>messages.</b> <b>In</b> March 1944, with the Sio code books in hand, it decrypted 36,000 messages.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{they would}} be killed if the Malagasy {{discovered}} the truth while still on board ship, the crew sealed their <b>messages</b> <b>in</b> bottles and dropped them into the onshore current. The VOC authorities in Cape Town had sent their chief ship's carpenter, Philip van den Berg, with two other ship's carpenters, two pilots, a quartermaster and 20 sailors overland. Carpenters were needed since neither of Meermin boats, now onshore, could be used: one {{was buried in the}} sand, and the other was in need of repair. The party from Cape Town had arrived by 6March, and, while Johannes Le Sueur was overseeing the carpenters' examination of Meermins boats, he was handed a bottle containing a message signed by Jan de Leeuw. A second bottle, containing a message signed by Olof Leij, was also found and handed to Le Sueur, and the fires were lit on 7March. One of the messages is preserved in the Cape Archives Repository.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Pedrarias {{travelled}} to Nicaragua from Panama, executed Hernández de Córdoba, {{and took}} direct {{control of the}} province. He claimed Honduras for himself and sent several expeditions into the Olancho Valley. Saavedra demanded that Pedrarias withdraw, and received conciliatory <b>messages</b> <b>in</b> return. Pedrarias then launched a surprise attack against Cortes' supporters, capturing {{a number of them}} in Olancho, then marching north with the intention of launching an attack upon Puerto de Caballos. Saavedra received news of the northward assault and dispatched a larger force to counter Pedrarias' captains. After negotiations, both forces agreed to retreat. In the event, Pedrarias' force reneged on the agreement and split into two. One portion continued its march towards Puerto de Caballos while the other returned to Olancho to found a settlement and hold the valley for Pedrarias.|$|E

Bruce and Utsler participated in a three-day photo shoot for the album's promotional images. The album's release was preceded with a nationwide in-store tour beginning in August, and followed by a 64-day tour, including the group's annual Halloween performance in Detroit. The album was released in three different color variations of the cover: red, blue, and green. Each version features its own unique introduction and hidden track. A sampler for the album was released, featuring a decoder piece for finding hidden <b>messages</b> <b>in</b> the album's artwork.|$|E

They realize the handler removed a small crystalline disk from the Federal agent's hand when he identified her body, and that he is now going to exchange it for something else. Olivia intercepts the man, who is killed before she can talk to him. She chases another man involved in the exchange, who commits suicide in front of a bus after giving them a briefcase containing the disc. Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) secretly gives the disc to Nina for analysis, while Roy is sent home, as they believe he will no longer see visions because the Ghost Network has been compromised.|$|E
5|$|At Gibraltar, {{the only}} ship in harbour was the small sloop-of-war HMS Calpe under Captain George Dundas, who on {{sighting}} the French squadron immediately sent word to Saumarez off Cadiz. The message arrived on 5 July, delivered by Lieutenant Richard Janvrin {{in a small}} boat. The admiral, {{a veteran of the}} Battle of the Nile, immediately gathered his ships and sailed eastwards to investigate. He had only six ships of the line as one, HMS Superb under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, was on detached duty {{at the mouth of the}} Guadalquivir River with the brig HMS Pasley. Saumarez sent <b>messages</b> <b>in</b> the frigate HMS Thames recalling Keats, who followed Saumarez towards Algeciras, and was in sight of the admiral's ship on the horizon at dawn on 6 July. However, after hearing an inaccurate report from an American merchant ship that Linois had already sailed from Algeciras, Keats reasoned that the French would have turned eastwards for Toulon and thus he would be too late to catch them. He therefore resolved to return to his station observing the Spanish at Cadiz, retaining Pasley and Thames.|$|E
