40|$|Michele Barker will trace a {{creative}} genealogy between early moving image {{devices such as}} the praxinoscope and contemporary digital installations. Arguing that such devices are relational movement <b>machines,</b> <b>Barker</b> will explore more preindivduated perception from which moving bodies and media arise. Her talk will focus on her recent installation évasion (with Munster, 2014) ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{hydraulic}} debarker is a <b>machine</b> removing <b>bark</b> from wooden logs {{by the use}} {{of water}} under a pressure of 100 psia (6.8 atmospheres) or greater. [...] Hydraulic debarking can reduce soil and rock content of bark, but may increase the water content. Debarking water may be recycled after effective settling, but suspended solids may increase wear on high-pressure pumps. Hydraulic debarking has declined where water quality problems have arisen.|$|R
50|$|While {{returning}} his Snipe to {{an aircraft}} depot, he crossed enemy lines at 21,000 {{feet above the}} Forêt de Mormal. He attacked an enemy Rumpler two-seater which broke up, its crew escaping by parachute (the aircraft was of FAA 227, Observer Lt. Oskar Wattenburg killed). By his own admission, he was careless and was bounced by a formation of Fokker D.VIIs of Jagdgruppe 12, consisting of Jasta 24 and Jasta 44. In a descending battle against 15 or more enemy <b>machines,</b> <b>Barker</b> was wounded {{three times in the}} legs, then his left elbow was blown away, yet he managed to control his Snipe and shoot down or drive down three more enemy aircraft (two German pilot casualties were Vfw. Alfons Schymik of Jasta 24, killed, and Lt. Hinky of Jasta 44, wounded). The dogfight took place immediately above the lines of the Canadian Corps. Severely wounded and bleeding profusely, Barker force-landed inside Allied lines, his life being saved by the men of an RAF Kite Balloon Section who transported him to a field dressing station. The fuselage of his Snipe aircraft was recovered from the battlefield and is preserved at the Canadian War Museum, Ottawa, Ontario.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to his industrial roots, Connelly explored various genres in his solo works. In 2013, he has started two projects more in the vein of industrial: Cocksure, with Jason C. Novak (Czar and Acumen Nation), and Bells into <b>Machines,</b> with Paul <b>Barker</b> (Ministry, Revolting Cocks, and Lard).|$|R
50|$|In 1840 Antoine Sauvage, a {{follower}} of Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, undertook a full restoration.He installed a <b>Barker</b> <b>machine</b> and made changes that reflected the new romantic aesthetic.In 1917 the piping was melted, the mechanism destroyed and the cabinet seriously damaged.The cabinet was rebuilt during {{the restoration of the}} basilica.Haerpfer-Erman of Boulay-Moselle, was given the job of reconstructing the organ in 1961, and the new organ was inaugurated on 27-28 May 1967.It has four keyboards with 61 notes and a pedal with 32 notes.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of a}} total {{restoration}} of the church (1979 to 1985), the existing organ was obtained as a monument worthy instrument, {{but at the same}} the front panel time pushed back. The I and II Manual have been faithfully restored, originally located at the far end, III Manual (Swell) was then set down a level to the lower case. Also, the laterally placed pedal mechanism had to be recreated on two levels. The instrument again consisted of mechanical cone chests, equipped with the three manuals and modern <b>Barker</b> <b>machines.</b> 51 of the 66 registers are now wholly or partly of the original organ, 4 registers were reconstructed and 11 registers, mostly in the Swell, have been added.|$|R
5000|$|When {{recording}} {{scores and}} composing, he records traditional and authentic instruments {{through a variety}} of collectible guitar pedals and analog <b>machines.</b> James Edward <b>Barker</b> quote: [...] "Much of my work has been the result of trial and error with working for many years alongside the chief designer for Vestax, Steve Hills, who worked there during the late 1980s and 1990s. We spent time remodelling a number of already rare and vintage pedals in order to attain certain sounds... including the rebuilding and modifying of pedals such as the Roland GR-300 and the 1980s Morley Pik series, with the Pik-Percussion and Pik-A-Wah pedals. Steve also encouraged me to experiment with the early pre DJ Vestax pedals".|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} is to {{summarize}} usage of tractors in timber extraction and major problems of mechanized&# 13; timber harvesting in Turkey. Timber harvesting in Turkey is still carried out by manual methods due to&# 13; economical, social and environmental constraints. Almost 80 % of harvesting activities are mechanized in many&# 13; developed countries while this value is only 5 % in Turkey. Overall ratio of mechanization is relatively low. &# 13; Approximately percentage of man power, animal power, machine power and skyline harvesting are 72, 15, 8 and&# 13; 5 %, respectively. Turkish General Directorate of Forestry's mechanical park total amount is 457 in 2004. &# 13; Mechanical park amount has been reduced to 19 tractors (4 x 4 and assembled shovel), 169 skidding winches,&# 13; 6 tractors with equipment of snow cleaner, 46 forklifts, 26 loaders, 32 skylines, 65 agricultural tractors, 88 trucks,&# 13; 4 agricultural tractors with shovel, 2 <b>barking</b> <b>machines</b> as of 2004. Approximate percentages of skidders, trucks,&# 13; 4 x 2 tractors, forklifts, skylines, loaders, 4 x 4 tractors and <b>barking</b> <b>machines</b> are 36. 9, 19. 3, 16. 4, 10, 7, 5. 7, 4. 2 and&# 13; 0. 5 % in 2004. 4 x 2 and 4 x 4 tractors total amount has been reached to 41. 7 % in 1982, but this percentage has been&# 13; reduced to 20. 6 % in 2004. Total machine park amount has been reduced 41. 4 % between years 1998 - 2004 in&# 13; Turkey. In spite of existence of substantial number of harvesters, the amount of modern harvesting processor in&# 13; Turkey is not sufficient. Different type and marked machine hasn't taken into consideration to improve&# 13; mechanization and a poor standardization in harvesting is another problem in Turkey...|$|R
40|$|Trees {{and shrubs}} bring beauty to home landscapes but {{sometimes}} common cultural practices can have {{adverse effects on}} the health of the plants. Use of lawn mowers, sprinkler systems, fertilizers and mulch, practices that are supposed to keep one’s garden and lawn green, can cause great problems for the home garden if not used properly. This fact sheet is designed to help the average home gardener understand how to identify the symptoms of improper garden care and take the necessary measures to maintain trees and shrubs that are healthy and green. Mechanical Damage Lawn mowers and edge-trimmers are supposed to help keep a lawn and garden looking crisp and clean; however the trunks of trees and shrubs are easy targets of careless use of these <b>machines.</b> Chipped <b>bark</b> exposes vascular tissue to the elements, providing an easy entry for bacteria, fungi, and pest to enter and infest a plant. Trees and shrubs are most susceptible to serious injury and disease during the spring when leaves are emerging and the bark is not fully developed after winter dormancy, as well as during fall leaf drop. Bark splitting is caused by the wounds from pruning, insects, mechanical damage from lawn mowers and weed-whackers or planting too deep. Decline or dieback may also occur from trunk damage; fungi, bacteria, and insects can cause the breakdown of tissue around and inside the wound, causing structural problems for the root buttresses and lower trunk area...|$|R
