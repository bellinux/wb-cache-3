Focusing on {{the first and the}} second card dealing, we discussed the condition where the second card is removed without keeping both the top and the third cards stationary, and showed {{that it is hard to}} keep the third card stationary while we can easily achieve to keep the top card stationary. Based on these discussions, we designed and developed the four-fingered robot where two of four fingers have actuators and the remaining fingers do not have. The measurement of pressure distribution during the second-card-dealing showed that the friction force heavily changes during the card manipulation and the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stopper</b> is definitely needed for keeping the second card stationary. As an example, we showed that the robot can achieve a magic by quickly switching the first-card-dealing and the second-card-dealing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In this paper, a new S-shaped {{piezoelectric}} PZT cantilever is microfabricated for scavenging {{vibration energy}} at low frequencies (0 Hz) and low accelerations (. 4 g). The maximum voltage and normalized power are 42 mV and 0. 31 lW g- 2, respectively, at input accelera-tion of 0. 06 g. For acceleration above 0. 06 g, the vibration of PZT cantilever changes from a linear oscillation to a nonlinear impact oscillation {{due to the}} displacement con-straint introduced by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>stopper.</b> Based on the-oretical modeling and experimental results, the frequency broadening effect of the PZT cantilever is studied with varying stop distances and input accelerations. The oper-ation bandwidth of the piezoelectric PZT cantilever is able to extend from 3. 4 to 11. 1 Hz as the stop distance reduces from 1. 7 to 0. 7 mm for an acceleration of 0. 3 g, {{at the expense of}} the voltage and normalized power at resonance decreasing from 40 to 16 mV and from 17. 8 to 2. 8 nW g- 2, respectively. ...|$|E

The approach {{is based on}} an On-Off control law, manipulating the structure location by actuating or releasing the device if the actual location is greater or smaller than the reference desired position. The existing ripple is due to delays on the readout circuit and control circuitry. In order to minimize delays on the control part, a high sampling frequency, 5 MHz, is used. Experimental results show the tracking of signals up to 100 Hz and an extended travel range up to 88. 9 % of the full available gap (limited by the existing <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoppers</b> of the devices) ...|$|R
40|$|In this work, theoretical, numerical, and {{experimental}} investigations for vibration based energy harvesters (VBEH) have been conducted. To improve the current limitations of VBEHs, {{a combination of}} parametric excitation, geometric nonlinearity arising from centreline extensibility (mid-plane stretching), geometric imperfection, <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoppers</b> and an array configuration have all been explored as suitable mechanisms for increasing the broadband behaviour of a VBEH. This work mainly focused on the increased broadband behaviour of a doubly-clamped beam resonator with a magnetic tip mass and electromagnetic induction as the transduction mechanism; however, cantilever beam setups were also used in some cases when combining this work with existing methods in the literature. A comparison of a transversely and parametrically system was conducted first to assess the benefits of parametric excitation; a model identification procedure was proposed and it was found, sustained oscillations could be achieved and {{this led to a}} greater nonlinear broadband behaviour. Using parametric excitation, the effects of electrical damping, load resistance, initial axial displacement, geometric imperfection have been investigated; it was found that by slightly adjusting geometry, the fundamental and parametric resonance were combined and using imperfections an initial softening followed by strong hardening behaviour was observed. Furthermore, the end of this thesis explores using parametric excitation and geometric nonlinearity with conventional methods in the literature, such as, <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoppers</b> and an array configuration; it was found that parametric resonance offered an increased bandwidth and power harvested for the VBEH devices fabricated. Parametric excitation, geometric nonlinearity and other nonlinear mechanisms {{have a significant effect on}} the qualitative and quantitative change in the frequency bandwidth of a VBEH device. This behaviour can be used to further enhance the bandwidth, power, efficiency, and performance of VBEH technology...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA MEMS-based {{piezoelectric}} {{energy harvesting}} (PiezoEH) system is proposed and investigated {{not only with}} a wideband and steadily increased output voltage ranging from 50 mV at 30 Hz to 102 mV at 52 Hz, {{but also with the}} capability of converting random and low-frequency vibrations into high-frequency self-oscillations. The PiezoEH system consists of a bottom PZT cantilever (PZT-B) with low resonant frequency of 36 Hz and a top PZT cantilever (PZT-T) with high resonant frequency of 618 Hz packaged closely.

40|$|This paper reviews {{possible}} {{strategies to}} increase the operational frequency range of vibration-based micro-generators. Most vibration-based micro-generators are spring-mass-damper systems which generate maximum power when the resonant frequency of the generator matches {{the frequency of the}} ambient vibration. Any difference between these two frequencies can result in a significant decrease in generated power. This is a fundamental limitation of resonant vibration generators which restricts their capability in real applications. Possible solutions include the periodic tuning of the resonant frequency of the generator so that it matches the frequency of the ambient vibration at all times or widening the bandwidth of the generator. Periodic tuning can be achieved using mechanical or electrical methods. Bandwidth widening can be achieved using a generator array, a <b>mechanical</b> <b>stopper,</b> non-linear (e. g. magnetic) springs or bi-stable structures. Tuning methods can be classified into intermittent tuning (power is consumed periodically to tune the device) and continuous tuning (the tuning mechanism is continuously powered). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the principles and operating strategies for increasing the operating frequency range of vibration-based micro-generators presented in the literature to date. The advantages and disadvantages of each strategy are evaluated and conclusions are drawn regarding the relevant merits of each approach...|$|E
40|$|Flapping foils are the {{standard}} engineering approximation for many biological actuators in air and water, but these devices typically provide propulsion {{at the cost}} of parasitic oscillatory forces. The addition of in-line motion to a flapping foil trajectory can improve the control of the fluid force. Previous work has shown that by actuating the heave, surge, and pitch motions of a foil and iteratively optimizing the results, the lift and thrust forces on the foil can be precisely and independently controlled. In this thesis, the same experiment is modified to include solely passive pitch to determine if similar force control performance can be achieved without either a fully actuated pitch motion or an optimization process. In the new experiment, the fluid forces naturally drive the pitch motion for most of the flapping cycle, until the foil reaches a maximum pitch angle, which is set with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>stopper.</b> The hydrodynamic forces are recorded for a range of trajectories that include forwards in-line, backwards in-line, and no in-line motion. Lift force control improves over that of the fully actuated system, but thrust force control is not achieved to the same level of performance. Further work can be done to determine whether simple pitch angle control can be implemented to improve thrust force control without the addition of the optimization process. by Fiona Grant.

40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} a {{wideband}} quintuple-well potential piezoelectric-based vibration energy harvester using a combined nonlinearity: the magnetic nonlinearity induced by magnetic {{force and the}} piecewise-linearity produced by mechanical impact. With extra stable states compared to other multi-stable harvesters, the quin-stable harvester can distribute its potential energy more uniformly, which provides shallower potential wells and results in lower excitation threshold for interwell motion. The mathematical model of this quin-stable harvester is derived and its equivalent piecewise-nonlinear restoring force is measured in the experiment and identified as piecewise polynomials. Numerical simulations and experimental verifications are performed in different levels of sinusoid excitation ranging from 1 to 25 Hz. The results demonstrate that, with lower potential barriers compared with tri-stable counterpart, the quin-stable arrangement can escape potential wells more easily for doing high-energy interwell motion over a wider band of frequencies. Moreover, by utilizing the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoppers,</b> this harvester can produce significant output voltage under small tip deflections, which results in a high power density and is especially suitable for a compact MEMS approach...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel electrochemically assisted wet-etching method for maskless selective removal of metal layers. This method {{has been developed}} as the key process step for enabling the fabrication of low-loss 3 -D micromachined silicon-on-insulator-based radio-frequency microelectromechanical systems transmission line components, consisting of a silicon core in the device layer covered by a gold metallization layer. For this application, the full-wafer sputtered metallization layer must be locally removed on the handle layer to guarantee for a well-defined and low-loss coplanar-waveguide propagation mode in the slots of the transmission line. It {{is not possible to}} use conventional photolithography or shadow masking. Gold areas to be etched are biased by a 1. 2 -V potential difference to a saturated calomel reference electrode in a NaCl(aq) solution. The measured etch rate of the proposed local electrochemically biased etching process is 520 nm/min, and no detectable etching was observed on unbiased areas even after a 1 -h etch. The suitability of different adhesion layers has been investigated, and Ti-based adhesion layers were found to result in the highest yield. The new etching method has been successfully applied for the fabrication of transmission lines with integrated microswitches, lowering the insertion loss of the waveguide at 10 GHz from 1. 3 to 0. 3 dB/mm. The issue of unwanted thin metallic connections caused by secondary deposition during sputtering is discussed but found not to significantly affect the process yield. Finally, local removal of gold on isolated features even within the device layer is presented for locally removing the metallization on stoppers of laterally moving electrostatic actuators, to drastically reduce the <b>mechanical</b> wear on <b>stopper</b> tips. © 2011 IEEE.

40|$|Abstract—The {{nonlinear}} {{dynamics of}} the parallel-plate electro-statically driven microstructure have been investigated {{with the objective of}} finding a dynamic voltage drive suitable for full-gap operation. Nonlinear dynamic modeling with phase-portrait pre-sentation of both position and velocity of a realistic microstruc-ture demonstrate that instability is avoided by a timely and suffi-cient reduction of the drive voltage. The simulation results are con-firmed by experiments on devices fabricated in an epi-poly process. A 5. 5 -V peak harmonic drive voltage with frequency higher than 300 Hz allows repetitive microstructure motion up to 70 % of gap without position feedback. The results of the analysis have been applied to the design of a new concept for positioning beyond the static pull-in limitation that does include position feedback. The measured instantaneous actuator displacement is compared with the desired displacement setting and, unlike traditional feedback, the voltage applied to the actuator is changed according to the com-parison result between two values. The “low ” level is below the static pull-in voltage and opposes the motion, thus bringing the structure back into a stable regime, while the “high ” level is larger than the static pull-in voltage and will push the structure beyond the static pull-in displacement. Operation is limited only by the po-sition jitter due to the time delay introduced by the readout cir-cuits. Measurements confirm flexible operation up to a <b>mechanical</b> <b>stopper</b> positioned at 2 m of the 2. 25 m wide gap with a 30 nm ripple.

40|$|AbstractThe {{single beam}} {{structure}} has been long used in piezoelectric energy harvesting to harvest the vibrations of the circumstances. One {{of the critical}} defects of the structure is its narrow band of operating frequency. Many propose mechanical stoppers, rigid or non-rigid, such as another beam, to create a non-linear broadband effect. Moreover, with a piecewise linear PEG (Piezoelectric Energy Generator), or a simple cantilever beam {{with one or two}} mechanical stoppers laid on its sides, the constant driven amplitude of the beam displacement can be enlarged by a perturbation. It is also proposed that the stoppers prevent the piezoelectric pad from cracking due to over deformation. However, from a long-term point of view, the impact of the beam on the stoppers can also cause faster fatigue of the beam body, not to mention the noise that will hinder its practical application which maybe apparatuses nearby human. Therefore, this paper proposes a magnetic pair to serve as the stoppers for piezoelectric beam, so as to perform similar effects of bandwidth enlargement and also the amplification using perturbation. With no actual contacts, the single beam can be well protected, but also eliminated from over bending by the magnets. By placing the magnets on a beam {{on each side of the}} main beam. The magnetic force, which is distance dependent, can provide a smoother feedback to the beam, giving a greater displacement in comparison to the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stopper.</b> Moreover, the characteristic of the beam output is altered so that there exists two peaking frequencies, depending on the design of the stopper beams...|$|E
