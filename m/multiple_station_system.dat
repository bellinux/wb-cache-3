Maximum transmission {{rate of the}} developed WLAN equipment was 324 Mbit/sec using 6 multi-channels of 802. 11 a. We proposed a novel frame aggregation scheme to improve MAC efficiency. The proposed frame aggregation scheme had a feature of an adaptive aggregation size selection depending on the wireless channel conditions and application requirements. Throughput performance was obtained from simulation using a <b>multiple</b> <b>station</b> <b>system</b> with the proposed frame aggregation. A throughput of more than 150 Mbit/sec was achieved with an evaluated system of 10 STAs. We {{also found that the}} measured throughput of more than 170 Mbit/sec was achieved using the proposed frame aggregation...|$|E
40|$|Deteriorated {{equipment}} condition {{has a significant}} impact on the product quality and maintenance policies. It is well known that online diagnosis systems and intelligent maintenance strategy play an important role to support maintenance and production in the modern manufacturing industry. Among numerous issues related to manufacturing maintenance, we address three major challenging problems: 1) an adaptive anomaly detection algorithm for condition-based maintenance, 2) more accurate stochastic models for preventive maintenance, and 3) joint maintenance and production scheduling for a multiple product and <b>multiple</b> <b>station</b> <b>system.</b> Adaptive anomaly detection allows us to conduct not only the online degradation assessment but also anomaly diagnosis in the presence of unknown faults. This algorithm is realized by using the hidden Markov model with reinforcement learning techniques. Online machine health information can further be investigated for the relationship on the product quality and equipment deterioration. Based on impact of machine condition to the product quality, we develop an integrated maintenance and dynamic product sequencing policy that can be applied to a multiple product and <b>multiple</b> <b>station</b> <b>system.</b> For preventive maintenance, the traditional degradation models only focus on a single machine system and ignore maintenance durations. We perform analytical and numerical examination of production lines with the Markov process framework, focusing on the more accurate dynamic behavior modeling and multiple maintenance tasks. Non-exponential holding time distributions in Markov chain are approximated by inserting multiple intermediate states based on a phase-type distribution. By having an adequate model representing both deterioration and maintenance processes, we can find different optimal maintenance policies to maximize the availability or productivity for different configurations of components...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{car sharing}} systems are round-trip and require advance reservations. The {{advances}} of ICT and vehicle automation allow to improve car sharing sys-tems {{and to provide}} users with greater flexibility. As it concerns reservation, new car sharing systems offer users open-ended reservation and/or instant access. As it concerns the trip typology, new car sharing <b>systems</b> are <b>multiple</b> <b>station</b> shared vehicle <b>systems</b> (MSSVS). Roundtrips still occur {{in this type of}} system, however there is a large number of one-way trips made between the <b>multiple</b> <b>stations.</b> Operating an MSSVS is much more difficult than operating a round-trip shared vehicle systems. The problem is that the system can quickly become imbalanced with respect to the number of vehicles at the <b>multiple</b> <b>stations.</b> These <b>systems</b> are called new (or second) generation car sharing systems. Third generation systems are the last being developed; in these systems vehicles can be accessed at any point of the area. An overview of all these car sharing systems is provided in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We study <b>multiple</b> base <b>station,</b> {{multi-access}} <b>systems</b> {{in which}} the user-base station adjacency is induced by geograph-ical proximity. At each slot, each user transmits (is active) with a certain probability, independently of other users, and is heard by all base stations within the distance r. Both the users and base stations are placed uniformly at random over the (unit) area. We first consider a non-cooperative decoding where base stations work in isolation, but a user is decoded {{as soon as one}} of its nearby base stations reads a clean signal from it. We find the de-coding probability and quantify the gains introduced by <b>multiple</b> base <b>stations.</b> Specifically, the peak throughput increases linearly with the number of base stations m and is roughly m/ 4 larger than the throughput of a single-base station that uses standard slotted Aloha. Next, we propose a cooperative decoding, where the mutually close base stations inform each other whenever they decode a user inside their coverage overlap. At each base station, the messages received from the nearby stations help resolve collisions by the interference cancellation mechanism. Building from our exact formulas for the non-cooperative case, we provide a heuristic formula for the cooperative decoding probability that reflects well the actual performance. Finally, we demonstrate by simulation significant gains of cooperation with respect to the non-cooperative decoding. I...|$|R

However, they showed a different survival even in the same stage. We tried to determine the prognostic implication of the <b>multiple</b> <b>station</b> N 2 lymph node metastasis in stage IIIA N 2 {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC). The survival of stage IIIA N 2 was analyzed according to the number of N 2 station and their survival was compared with that of stage IIIB. In stage IIIA N 2 NSCLC, multivariate analysis indicated that <b>multiple</b> <b>station</b> N 2 was one of the independent prognostic factors for poor survival. The 5 -yr survival of <b>multiple</b> <b>station</b> N 2 IIIA (20. 4 %) was lower than that of single station N 2 IIIA (33. 8 %) significantly (p= 0. 016). but when it was compared with that of stage IIIB (15. 5 %), there was no difference. Therefore, we suggest that <b>multiple</b> <b>station</b> N 2 should be considered similar to stage IIIB disease with regard to predicting survival and accordingly should receive a new position in the TNM staging system...|$|R
