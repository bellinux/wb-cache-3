40|$|Is Japan {{on a path}} towards {{assuming}} a greater military role internationally, or has the recent military normalisation {{ground to a halt}} since the premiership of Junichiro Koizumi? In this book, Christopher W.

In all of these areas, dynamic and long-term changes outweigh Japan’s short-term political logjam over security policy. Hughes argues that many post-war constraints on Japan’s military role are still eroding, and that Tokyo is moving towards a more assertive military role and strengthened US–Japan cooperation. Japan’s remilitarisation will boost its international security role and the dominance of the US–Japan alliance in regional and global security affairs, but will need to be carefully managed if it is not to become a source of destabilising tensions...|$|R

The formidable <b>military-industrial</b> <b>complexes</b> built up during the cold war years now switched their attention to the general aviation markets, which at the time were already on the decline. This caused even more hardship in the markets and the whole industry slipped into a major recession throughout Europe and the United States of America, characterised by low capacity utilisation, high unemployment and very low profit margins (IngersolI Engineers, 1994 : 34).

40|$|The {{importance}} of oil for national <b>military-industrial</b> <b>complexes</b> appeared {{more clearly than}} ever in the Cold War. This volume argues that the confidential acquisition of geoscientific knowledge was paramount for states, not only {{to provide for their}} own energy needs, but also to buttress national economic and geostrategic interests and protect energy security. By investigating the postwar rebuilding and expansion of French and Italian oil industries from {{the second half of the}} 1940 s to the early 1960 s, this book shows how successive administrations in those countries devised strategies of oil exploration and transport, aiming at achieving a higher degree of energy autonomy and setting up powerful oil agencies that could implement those strategies. However, both within and outside their national territories, these two European countries had to confront the new Cold War balances and the interests of the two superpowers. Introduction 1.

40|$|For {{much of the}} twentieth-century, {{aluminium}} producers {{enjoyed a}} close relationship with national governments, not least as prominent players in <b>military-industrial</b> <b>complexes</b> (for example, Anderson 1951; Smith 1988; Grinberg and Hachez-Leroy 1997). This paper explores the ideological motivations and political activities of senior figures within Britain’s dominant native aluminium producer for much of the twentieth-century, the British Aluminium Company Ltd. (BACo), drawing on work by the author (Perchard 2007, 2010). As a company self-styled as ‘the Service’, support within BACo for imperial priorities and patrician values was sustained both by commercial imperatives as well as the social and cultural background of many of the directors (until the 1960 s), amongst them hereditary landowners, retired senior military officers and latterly senior civil servants. This paper will examine the political activities of directors collectively and individually through their engagement with power elites (Mills 1956). In particular, it will focus upon the areas of imperial defence, and regional development in the Scottish Highlands (where BACo’s main smelters were based), to illustrate how their involvement in political activities and social networks was both self-serving and governed by instinctive values. In so doing it will also comment upon the ‘revolving door’ between public and private spheres. While calling into question the general application of the notion of a ‘gentlemanly capitalist’ order, this paper accords with Larry Butler’s view of imperial mining concerns and the British metropolitan government’s priorities during decolonization that: ‘it may, rather, be more accurate to speak of temporary convergences of interest’ (Butler 2007 : 477; Cain and Hopkins 1987) ...|$|R
25|$|Much {{of the aid}} can {{be better}} {{understood}} when considering the economic distortions caused by the war. Most belligerent powers cut back severely on production of non-essentials, concentrating on producing weapons. This inevitably produced shortages of related products needed by the military {{or as part of}} the <b>military-industrial</b> <b>complex.</b> For example, the USSR was highly dependent on rail transportation, but the war practically shut down rail equipment production. Just 446 locomotives were produced during the war, with only 92 of those being built between 1942 and 1945. In total, 92.7% of the wartime production of railroad equipment by the Soviet Union was supplied under Lend-Lease, including 1,911 locomotives and 11,225 railcars which augmented the existing prewar stocks of at least 20,000 locomotives and half a million railcars.|$|E

40|$|This article {{represents}} a preliminary attempt to conceptualize {{the relationship between}} technology and global inequality, using a political economy of the world-system per-spective. Despite the crucial role that technical innovation and adaptation play {{in the process of}} international development, many macroanalyses of social change focus little explicit attention on technology. Only neoevolutionary theory discusses its role in long-term social change, and then in ways that miss some key dimensions. The author argues that technology is a social product designed to fit the needs of the rich and powerful. In the contemporary world, it is usually produced by a highly organized (and expansive) research and development (R&D) industry, often explicitly linked to <b>military-industrial</b> <b>complexes.</b> Rhetoric about increased globalization notwithstanding, technol-ogy is a key resource in the present capitalist world-economy that is very unevenly dtstributed, with the advanced industrial "core " states (and their giant transnational corporations) controlling technological innovation and dissemination. Even newly industrializing countries (NICs) like South Korea, which many consider technologically sophisticated, experience profound technological dependence, limiting their prospects for truly autonomous economic growth. Differential control of technology and techno-logical innovation is a defining trait of global inequality in the late twentieth century. Technology is a critical element in understanding the process of interna-tional development and world inequality. The unequivocal assertion of economic geographer Peter Dicken (1992) is widely shared and rings true: &dquo;Technological change {{is at the heart of}} the process of economic growth and economic development&dquo; (p. 97).

40|$|Environmental {{degradation}} is {{the most}} important complex of problems ever confronted by humanity. Humans are interfering with the world's ecosystems so severely that they are beginning to undermine the conditions for their own continued existence. They are polluting the air, the oceans and the land. They are rapidly exhausting the reserves of minerals and destroying the resources of the world on which civilization depends, while destroying other life forms on a massive scale. At the same time humans are increasingly enclosing themselves in built environments which isolate them and fragment their lives, destroy their health and reduce them to either the dehumanized instruments of <b>military-industrial</b> <b>complexes,</b> or to abject poverty. The problem of the environment is also the problem of over-population, the disproportionate consumption of resources by Western nations and the starvation of those in the Third World who lose out in the struggle for the remainder. If present trends continue the total destruction of civilization is probable within a few hundred years - and the extinction of the human species is a real possibility. 	This situation also presents the greatest intellectual challenge of the era. It undermines the traditional idea of economic progress - the ultimate evaluative concept and the virtual telos of European civilization. It brings into question the economic, legal, political and ethical institutions of modern societies and the modes of thought on which they are based, including the natural and social sciences and the institutions supporting them. In doing so, it opens up the most fundamental questions about human existence: the nature of knowledge and value, of meaning and rationality, and of the significance of life itself.

40|$|The post-Cold War era was characterised by {{both the}} {{recurrence}} of state wars {{and the spread of}} forms of organised violence other than wars. Asymmetric warfare between alliances led by the USA and groups of insurgents, such as those witnessed in Afghanistan and Iraq, coexist alongside domestic conflicts, such as that of former Yugoslavia and, more recently, Libya and Syria; and still other conflicts involving gangs, mafias or narco-traffickers. The massive <b>military-industrial</b> <b>complexes</b> conceived {{in the context of the}} threat of nuclear Armageddon are still there of course, but they now coexist with irregular armies of insurgents carrying out massacres through the use of light weapons and improvised explosives devices. This book oppose the idea that this situation prefigures the return to an anarchical, pre-political condition, by assuming that new wars are rather the product of the blurring of the public-private divide, induced by the end of the Cold War, together with globalisation. As a consequence, also the internal and external factors are blurred; and ever more permeable and elusive is becoming even the border between war and crime. Inside War goes beyond a state-centered analysis and adopts an interdisciplinary and multilayered approach, and is intended to foster the dialogue among researchers from different fields. It places war at the core of analysis, assuming that the reality of war is what we make of it; and that the only insurmountable limit to our comprehension of war is our way of knowing and representing it.
