25|$|Jakac was {{essentially}} a black-and-white artist. His favourite painting technique was chalk pastel, which appealed to him due to its <b>mellowness</b> and the possibility for quick painting during his numerous travels.|$|E
25|$|In {{his style}} of painting, Mr. Aikman seems to have aimed at imitating nature in her {{pleasing}} simplicity: his lights are soft, his shades mellow, and his colouring mild and harmonious. His touches have neither the force nor harshness of Rubens; nor does he seem, like Reynolds, ever to have aimed at adorning his portraits with the elegance of adventitious graces. His mind, tranquil and serene, delighted rather to wander with Thomson in the enchanting fields of Tempe, than to burst, with Michelangelo, into the ruder scenes of the terrible and the sublime. His compositions are distinguished by a placid tranquility and ease rather than a striking brilliancy of effect: and his portraits may be more readily mistaken for those of Kneller than any other eminent artist; {{not only because of}} the general resemblance in the dresses, which were those of the times, they being contemporaries, but also for the manner of working, and the similarity and bland <b>mellowness</b> of their tints.|$|E
500|$|Lost Horizons is {{the second}} studio album from the British {{electronic}} duo Lemon Jelly, released on 7 October 2002. Released by XL Recordings and produced by Nick Franglen, the album generated two charting singles in the UK, [...] "Space Walk" [...] and [...] "Nice Weather for Ducks"; the latter has often been called the album's stand-out track. The album, which is built around a mix of organic instrumentation and idiosyncratic samples, was met with largely positive reviews by music critics, although it was somewhat critiqued due to its near-constant <b>mellowness.</b>|$|E
500|$|Lost Horizons {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics, although several critics critiqued the album's near-constant <b>mellowness.</b> Stuart Mason of AllMusic called the album [...] "a delightful but slightly faceless blend of lounge pop, subtle beats, found sound, with mellow jazz influences." [...] A reviewer for Entertainment.ie praised the band for approaching electronica {{from a new}} angle, writing, [...] "this London-based duo employ Playschool pianos, acoustic guitars and sprightly beats to create laid-back instrumentals guaranteed to soothe even the most restless of souls. [...] What really marks Lemon Jelly as exciting new talents is their quirky sense of humour, which they use to brighten up their sound with skilful use of nursery rhymes, brass bands and offbeat samples. Pascal Wyse of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Everything is approachable and purely crafted, but Lost Horizons cheats banality with some choice quirks: Magnificent Seven strings, astronauts chatting, panoramic sound effects." [...] Chris Dahlen of Pitchfork felt that the album {{was a little too}} saccharine at times, but that it is [...] "the perfect disc to throw on after your four-disc Ultrachill Dub Groove Mix has put the whole party to sleep. It's like eight flavors of ribbon candy, beach balls hitting the ground like hail, and a big plastic clown face that blows helium." ...|$|E
500|$|The Radha–Birju {{relationship}} is described to have [...] "Oedipal elements" [...] by many authors; Virdi {{has argued that}} in her chastity, Radha channels her sexual desires into maternal love for her sons who effectively become [...] "substitute erotic subjects". Mishra opines that the crushing of the arms of Radha's husband and the <b>mellowness</b> of the older son symbolise castration, which is {{in contrast with the}} rebellion of Birju, identified with sexual potency. Birju's obsession with his mother's bracelets is an expression of his oedipal longings, according to Chakravarty. Rachel Dwyer, Professor of Indian Cultures and Cinema at SOAS, describes how [...] "suspiciously smoothly" [...] the Oedipal elements fit into the film and the off-screen romance between Nargis and Dutt, playing mother and son in the film. Radha's actions {{at the end of the}} film in shooting her own son was a breaking of traditional mother–son relationship to safeguard morality, according to author William Van der Heide. Virdi points out that this brought ambiguity to the mother figure who acts as a sacrificing provider and also as a destroyer, annihilating her own son, something rare in Hindi cinema. She interprets Birju's sexual advances on a village girl (which is incest in north Indian village culture) as being a substitute in the plot for the incestuous mother–son relationship and his death at the end as a punishment for violation of the taboo.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his early}} days as a {{professional}} cricketer, Ramprakash {{had a reputation as}} something of a mercurial and stormy character. Nicknamed [...] "Bloodaxe" [...] by Middlesex team-mates for his short temper, Ramprakash's younger days contrasted with the <b>mellowness</b> of his thirties. However, at times he continued to display the fiery temper, which has been compared to Mount Vesuvius, that many say prevented him from succeeding at international level.|$|E
2500|$|Brian Wilson {{is widely}} {{considered}} one of the most innovative and significant songwriters of the late 20th century, and his work is credited as a major innovation in the field of music production. Through the Beach Boys, writes The Buffalo Newss Jeff Miers, [...] " [...] pretty much single-handedly raised the craft of pop songwriting from the awkwardly sub-lunar to the gracefully sublime." [...] According to Erik Davis, [...] "Not only did the Beach Boys write a soundtrack to the early '60s, but Brian let loose a delicate and joyful art pop unique in music history and presaged the <b>mellowness</b> so fundamental to '70s California pop." [...] The A.V. Club wrote that Brian was among [...] "studio rats ... set the pace for how pop music could and should sound in the Flower Power era: at once starry-eyed and wistful." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Daily Telegraph {{wrote of}} his 1984 Andrea Chénier at London's Royal Opera House: [...] "Switching {{effortlessly}} from the lyric poet Rodolfo in La Bohème {{a few weeks}} ago to the heroic poet Chenier, the Spanish tenor's vocal artistry held us spellbound throughout." [...] Of his 1985 performance in Andrea Chénier at La Scala (preserved on DVD), Carl Battaglia wrote in Opera News that Carreras dominated the opera [...] "with formidable concentration and a cleverly refined vocal accent that imparts to this spinto role an overlay of intensity lacking in his essentially lyric tenor." [...] However, Carl H. Hiller's review of the La Scala performance in Opera also noted that while in the quiet phrases of the score [...] "he could display all the tonal <b>mellowness</b> of which this perhaps most beautiful tenor voice of our time is capable", he had difficulty with the high loud notes, which sounded strained and uneasily produced.|$|E
2500|$|American critics {{tended to}} have more mixed feelings, like Collider.com, who called the film [...] "an {{engaging}} yet uneven meldodrama", and Variety, who stated that while the film was [...] "a welcome return to the female-centric storytelling that has earned Almodóvar his greatest acclaim, {{it is far from}} this reformed renegade's strongest or most entertaining work". Similarly mixed, Slant Magazine thought Julieta was not one of Almodóvar's best films, but most compelling because of [...] "the bold, colorful compositions and framings that [...] has long mastered, which sketch psychological detail more acutely than Julieta's methodically orchestrated and rather sluggish story". Twitch Film felt the <b>mellowness</b> of Munro's work did not adapt well to Almodóvar's melodramatic style, concluding that [...] "Almodóvar seems content to let his past strengths wither in favour of banality". Indiewire also thought the director played too safe and called Julieta his most conventional film. The Hollywood Reporter felt the film would satisfy fans of Almodóvar, but was too decorous in comparison to his previous films: [...] "a politeness that's quite unlike the lusty vulgarity of the past. Some of us may not be sure we like it". However, TheWrap thought that [...] "a subdued Almodóvar is still a far sight weirder and more intriguing than most directors", adding that the film is [...] "a worthy part of a canon in which decorous should never be confused with dull".|$|E

According to Erik Davis, [...] "Not only did [...] write a soundtrack to the early '60s, but Brian let loose a delicate and joyful art pop unique in music history and presaged the <b>mellowness</b> so fundamental to '70s California pop." [...] The A.V. Club wrote that Wilson was among [...] "studio rats... set the pace for how pop music could and should sound in the Flower Power era: at once starry-eyed and wistful." [...] Sean O'Hagan of the High Llamas named Wilson an important pioneer of experimental pop. Once Wilson started incorporating quasi-symphonic textures into his work, many people began crediting him for propelling the mid-1960s art pop movement. Carlin wrote that Wilson was the forerunner of [...] "a new kind of art-rock that would combine the transcendent possibilities of art with the mainstream accessibility of pop music". He is also regarded as the most famous outsider musician. Author Irwin Chusid noted Wilson as an ironic example of the genre due to his past commercial success, but believes that Wilson's history of torment, substance abuse, and [...] "loopy" [...] material are what [...] "certify" [...] his outsider status.|$|E
60|$|The {{next thing}} I noticed {{was that a}} great <b>mellowness</b> had descended upon {{the mother of the}} last of his race. But these terms, irritation, <b>mellowness,</b> {{appeared}} gross when applied to her. It is impossible to give an idea of the refinement and subtlety of all her transformations. She smiled faintly at me.|$|E
60|$|The Excellency {{was a man}} of many moods. With {{the receipt}} of the money a great <b>mellowness</b> had descended upon his simple soul. Unexpectedly he fetched a deep sigh.|$|E
60|$|Again Mr. Haswell {{made the}} sound of wind among wires, only {{this time there was}} a shriller note in it; its <b>mellowness</b> was gone, it was as though the air had {{suddenly}} been filled with frost.|$|E
60|$|VERJUICE. 'Tis very true. She {{generally}} designs well[,] has a free {{tongue and}} a bold invention--but her colouring is too dark and her outline often extravagant--She wants that delicacy of Tint--and <b>mellowness</b> of sneer--which distinguish your Ladyship's Scandal.|$|E
60|$|She laughed helplessly again. Young Thomas laughed too. His embarrassment {{vanished}} in the <b>mellowness</b> of that laughter. Presently Adelia composed herself and {{removed from the}} woodbox to a chair, {{but there was still}} a suspicious twitching about the corners of her mouth.|$|E
60|$|Still, {{for all the}} {{careless}} {{ease with}} which she had made the landing, there was a warmer color than usual to her face, and a perceptibly extra beat to her heart. But then, also, {{it was with a}} certain reverent curiousness that she approached the cabin, while the Hush on her cheek showed a yet riper <b>mellowness.</b>|$|E
60|$|The Churches of the Dove are shy and hidden: they nestle among trees, {{and their}} bells {{sound in the}} <b>mellowness</b> of Sunday; or they are {{gathered}} into a silence of their own in the very midst of the town, so that one passes them by without observing them; they are as if invisible, offering no resistance to the storming of the traffic.|$|E
60|$|I was of two minds. Her {{laughter}} was delightful to the ear, {{there was such}} a <b>mellowness,</b> and healthiness, and frankness about it. On the other hand, that it should be directed at my misfortune was exasperating. I suppose my perplexity showed in my face, for when she had eased her laughter and looked at me with a sobering countenance, she immediately went off into more peals.|$|E
60|$|Three {{years later}} Jerome tried his luck again, with {{precisely}} the same result, and after that he had asked Anne regularly once a year to marry him, and just as regularly Anne said no a little more brusquely {{and a little more}} decidedly every year. Now, in the <b>mellowness</b> of a fifteen-year-old courtship, Jerome did not mind it at all. He knew that everything comes to the man who has patience to wait.|$|E
6000|$|Shortly {{before sunset}} that evening Eric {{went for a}} walk. When {{he did not go}} to the shore he liked to indulge in long tramps through the Lindsay fields and woods, in the <b>mellowness</b> of [...] "the sweet 'o the year." [...] Most of the Lindsay houses were built along the main road, which ran {{parallel}} to the shore, or about the stores at [...] "The Corner." [...] The farms ran back from them into solitudes of woods and pasture lands.|$|E
60|$|Andrew is, on the surface, a stoutish, easygoing elderly man, with kindly patient manners, and an {{engaging}} simplicity of character. But {{he has a}} watchful, deliberate, waiting, listening face, and formidable reserves of power, both bodily and mental, in his capacious chest and long head. His gentleness is partly that of a strong man who has learnt by experience that his natural grip hurts ordinary people unless he handles them very carefully, and partly the <b>mellowness</b> of age and success. He is also a little shy in his present very delicate situation.|$|E
60|$|He was {{certainly}} not going to tell this man that he had made his way through the fog as far as the residence of the Danish Minister, and that he had walked up and down for over an hour outside that house like a love-sick fool, like a doting idiot, because he knew that if he waited patiently he would presently hear the faint echo of a well-trained contralto voice whose <b>mellowness</b> would come to him through the closed windows of the brilliantly illumined mansion, and would ease for a moment the wild longing of his heart.|$|E
60|$|In {{one thing}} only could Kwaque rule Michael. Kwaque possessed a jews' harp, and, {{whenever}} {{the world of}} the Makambo and the servitude to the steward grew wearisome, he could transport himself to King William Island by thrusting the primitive instrument between his jaws and fanning weird rhythms from it with his hand, and when he thus crossed space and time, Michael sang--or howled, rather, though his howl possessed the same soft <b>mellowness</b> as Jerry's. Michael did not want to howl, but the chemistry of his being was such that he reacted to music as compulsively as elements react on one another in the laboratory.|$|E
60|$|Our appetites have {{commonly}} confined {{our views}} of ripeness and its phenomena, color, <b>mellowness,</b> and perfectness, to the fruits which we eat, {{and we are}} wont to forget that an immense harvest which we do not eat, hardly use at all, is annually ripened by Nature. At our annual Cattle Shows and Horticultural Exhibitions, we make, as we think, a great show of fair fruits, destined, however, to a rather ignoble end, fruits not valued for their beauty chiefly. But round about and within our towns there is annually another show of fruits, on an infinitely grander scale, fruits which address our taste for beauty alone.|$|E
6000|$|But {{that was}} the last of his <b>mellowness</b> and jolly companionship. The man from Sparta said he was a [...] "bum singer," [...] and for ten minutes Babbitt quarreled with him, in a loud, unsteady, heroic indignation. They called for drinks till the manager insisted that the place was closed. All the while Babbitt felt a hot raw desire for more brutal amusements. When W. A. Rogers drawled, [...] "What say we go down the line and look over the girls?" [...] he agreed savagely. Before they went, three of them {{secretly}} made appointments with the professional dancing girl, who agreed [...] "Yes, yes, sure, darling" [...] to everything they said, and amiably forgot them.|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "Coal-Coffin," [...] albeit an {{unseaworthy}} vessel, is {{a picturesque}} object. Its dirty sails {{are of a}} fine rich colour, because of their very dirtiness. Its weather-worn and filthy spars, and hull and rigging, possess a harmony of tone {{which can only be}} acquired by age. Its cordage being rotten and very limp, hangs, on that account, all the more gracefully in waving lines of beauty and elegant festoons; the reef points hang quite straight, and patter softly on the sails--in short, the tout ensemble of the little craft is eminently picturesque-- draped, as it were, with the <b>mellowness</b> of antiquity; and the whole-- hull, spars, sails, cordage, and reef points,--clearly and sharply reflected in the depths below.|$|E
6000|$|... [291] Ben Jonson told Drummond [...] "that in {{that paper}} Sir W. Raleigh had [...] of the allegories of his Faery Queen, by the Blatant Beast the [...] Puritans were understood." [...] But this is {{certainly}} wrong. There were [...] very different shades of Puritanism, according to individual [...] temperament. That of Winthrop and Higginson had a <b>mellowness</b> of which [...] Endicott and Standish were incapable The gradual change of Milton's [...] opinions {{was similar to that}} which I suppose in Spenser. The passage [...] in Mother Hubberd may have been aimed at the Protestant clergy of [...] Ireland (for he says much the same thing in his [...] "View of the State of [...] Ireland"), but it is general in its terms.|$|E
6000|$|Looking {{back on the}} long-stretched-out body of one's work, it is {{interesting}} to mark the endless duel fought within a man between the emotional and critical sides of his nature, first one, then the other, getting the upper hand, and too seldom fusing till the result has the <b>mellowness</b> of full achievement. One can even tell the nature of one's readers, by their preference for the work which reveals more of this side than of that. My early work was certainly more emotional than critical. But from 1901 came nine years when the critical was, in the main, holding sway. From 1910 to 1918 the emotional again struggled for the upper hand; and from that time on there seems to have been something of a [...] "dead beat." [...] So the conflict goes, by what mysterious tides promoted, I know not.|$|E
60|$|A close {{examination}} of the ground hereabout, even by the wan starlight only, revealed how a portion of {{what would have been}} casually called a wild slope had been appropriated by Farmer Oak for his great purpose this winter. Detached hurdles thatched with straw were stuck into the ground at various scattered points, amid and under which the whitish forms of his meek ewes moved and rustled. The ring of the sheep-bell, which had been silent during his absence, recommenced, in tones that had more <b>mellowness</b> than clearness, owing to an increasing growth of surrounding wool. This continued till Oak withdrew again from the flock. He returned to the hut, bringing in his arms a new-born lamb, consisting of four legs large enough for a full-grown sheep, united by a seemingly inconsiderable membrane about half the substance of the legs collectively, which constituted the animal's entire body just at present.|$|E
60|$|The {{other world}} beyond this, which was longed {{for by the}} devout before Columbus' time, {{was found in the}} New; and the deep-sea-lead, that first struck these soundings, brought up the soil of Earth's Paradise. Not a Paradise then, or now; but to be made so, at God's good pleasure, and in the {{fullness}} and <b>mellowness</b> of time. The seed is sown, and the harvest must come; and our children's children, on the world's jubilee morning, shall all go with their sickles to the reaping. Then shall the curse of Babel be revoked, a new Pentecost come, and the language they shall speak shall be the language of Britain. Frenchmen, and Danes, and Scots; and the dwellers on the shores of the Mediterranean, and in the regions round about; Italians, and Indians, and Moors; there shall appear unto them cloven tongues as of fire.|$|E
6000|$|The {{little old}} green-house temple {{of his early}} masterpieces was still extant, used now to protect {{watering}} pots. But no vestige of impulse towards work came to him down there. He was marking time; not restless, not bored, just waiting--but for what, he had no notion. And Sylvia, at any rate, was happy, blooming in these old haunts, losing her fairness in the sun; even taking again to a sunbonnet, which made her look extraordinarily young. The trout that poor old Gordy had so harried were left undisturbed. No gun was fired; rabbits, pigeons, even the few partridges enjoyed those first days of autumn unmolested. The bracken and leaves turned very early, so that the park in the hazy September sunlight had an almost golden hue. A gentle <b>mellowness</b> reigned over all that holiday. And from Ireland came no further news, save one picture postcard with the words: [...] "This is our house.--NELL." ...|$|E
6000|$|Carl {{was kept}} waiting for a half-hour. He {{did not like the}} {{transference}} to the dean, who was no anxious old lamb like S. Alcott Wood, but a young collegiate climber, with a clipped mustache, a gold eye-glass chain over one ear, a curt voice, many facts, a spurious appreciation of music, and no <b>mellowness.</b> He was a graduate of the University of Chicago, and aggressively proud of it. He had [...] "earned his way through college," [...] which all tradition and all fiction pronounce the perfect manner of acquiring a noble independence and financial ability. Indeed, the blessing of early poverty is in general praised as the perfect training for acquiring enough wealth to save one's own children from the curse of early poverty. It would be safer to malign George Washington and the Boy Scouts, professional baseball and the Y. M. C. A., than to suggest that working one's way through college is not necessarily manlier than playing and dreaming and reading one's way through.|$|E
6000|$|A girl may be pardoned {{who takes}} as a {{compliment}} the saying that her eyes are fatal. The words warmed Gyp, uncontrollably light-hearted in these days, {{just as she was}} warmed when people turned to stare at her. The soft air, the <b>mellowness</b> of this gay place, much music, a sense of being a rara avis among people who, by their heavier type, enhanced her own, had produced in her a kind of intoxication, making her what the baroness called [...] "un peu folle." [...] She was always breaking into laughter, having that precious feeling of twisting the world round her thumb, which does not come too often in the life of one who is sensitive. Everything to her just then was either [...] "funny" [...] or [...] "lovely." [...] And the baroness, conscious of the girl's chic, genuinely attracted by one so pretty, took care that she saw all the people, perhaps more than all, that were desirable.|$|E
60|$|And the colours of Murillo's palette are {{the typical}} colours of Andalusia, rich, hot, and deep--again {{contrasting}} with the enamelled {{brilliance of the}} Umbrians. He seems to have charged his brush with the very light and atmosphere of Seville; the country bathed in the splendour of an August sun has just the luminous character, the haziness of contour, which characterise the paintings of Murillo's latest manner. They say he adopted the style termed vaporoso for greater rapidity of execution, but he cannot have lived all his life in that radiant atmosphere without being impregnated with it. In Andalusia there is a quality of the air which gives all things a limpid, brilliant softness, the sea of gold poured out upon them voluptuously rounds away their outlines; and one can well imagine that the master deemed it the culmination of his art when he painted with the same aureate effulgence, when he put on canvas those gorgeous tints and that exquisite <b>mellowness.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{was already}} autumn, {{and in the}} city of New York an early Sunday morning breeze was {{sweeping}} up the leaves that had fallen from the regularly planted ailantus trees before the brown-stone frontage of a row of monotonously alike five-storied houses on one of the principal avenues. The Pastor of the Third Presbyterian Church, that uplifted its double towers on the corner, stopped before one of these dwellings, ran up the dozen broad steps, and rang the bell. He was presently admittted to the sombre richness of a hall and drawing-room with high-backed furniture of dark carved woods, like cathedral stalls, and, hat in hand, somewhat impatiently awaited the arrival of his hostess and parishioner. The door opened to a tall, white-haired woman in lustreless black silk. She was regular and resolute in features, of fine but unbending presence, and, though somewhat past middle age, showed no signs of either the weakness or <b>mellowness</b> of years.|$|E
