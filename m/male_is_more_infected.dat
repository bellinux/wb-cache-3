40|$|Campylobacteriosis is an {{extremely}} important zoonosis, circulating freely in the environment. In nonhuman primates kept in open facilities and bred for experimental purposes, the presence of Campylobacter spp. could cause severe damage to the production and interfere {{with the results of}} scientific research. In this paper, we assessed the circulation of Campylobacter spp. in a colony of clinically healthy rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) destined to research. The analysis was carried out during seven non-consecutive years. Data showed that despite several changes made in animal management along the studied years in order to control this zoonosis, reduction of bacterial charge did not occur. Significant differences among the age groups and sex were ob-served. Infants showed higher susceptibility than adult animals. In general <b>males</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>infected</b> than females. Modifications adopted in the handling techniques need to be reviewed with the intent of improving the production, reducing bacterial infection of the stock and avoiding undesirable cross reactions in the research carried out with these animals.

Urbanization of populations could be another factor, as tropical ulcer is usually a rural problem. More widespread use of shoes and socks also provides protection from initiating trauma. Despite this, susceptible individuals still develop tropical ulcers. Sometimes outbreaks can occur; one was recorded in Tanzania in sugarcane workers cutting the crops while barefoot. Tropical ulcers can also occur to the visitors of tropics.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on Oeosophagostomum sp., and more {{especially}} on O. bifurcum, as a parasite that can be lethal to humans and is widespread among humans and monkeys in endemic regions, but {{has not yet been}} documented in apes. Its epidemiology and the role played by non-human primates in its transmission are still poorly understood. O. stephanostomum was the only species diagnosed so far in chimpanzees. Until recently, O. bifurcum was assumed to have a high zoonotic potential, but recent findings tend to demonstrate that O. bifurcum of non-human primates and humans might be genetically distinct. As the closest relative to human beings, and a species living in spatial proximity to humans in the field site studied, Pan troglodytes is thus an interesting host to investigate. Recently, a role for chimpanzees in the emergence of HIV and malaria in humans has been documented. In the framework of our long-term health monitoring of wild chimpanzees from Kibale National Park in Western Uganda, we analysed 311 samples of faeces. Coproscopy revealed that high-ranking <b>males</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>infected</b> than other individuals. These chimpanzees <b>are</b> also the <b>more</b> frequent crop-raiders. Results from PCR assays conducted on larvae and dried faeces also revealed that O. stephanostomum as well as O. bifurcum are infecting chimpanzees, both species co-existing in the same individuals. Because contacts between humans and great apes are increasing with ecotourism and forest fragmentation in areas of high population density, this paper emphasizes that the presence of potential zoonotic parasites should be viewed as a major concern for public health. Investigations of the parasite status of people living around the park or working inside as well as sympatric non-human primates should be planned, and further research might reveal this as a promising aspect of efforts to reinforce measures against crop-raiding...|$|R

MethodsUrine filtration technique using polycarbonate membrane filters was employed to process urine specimens and to determine presence of Schistosoma haematobium eggs in urine. Questionnaires were also administered to children to collect information on socio-demographic data and water-contact activities. ResultsAn overall prevalence of 55. 0 % (165 / 300) was recorded out of the 300 urine samples examined. Prevalence of infection varied between 36. 0 %- 64. 0 % with a significant difference (χ 2 = 11. 59, P= 0. 041) between the different communities visited. <b>Males</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>infected</b> (60. 6 %, 103 / 170) than females (47. 7 %, 62 / 130) with a significant difference (χ 2 = 4. 95, P= 0. 026). The age-related prevalence showed higher prevalence (70. 5 %, 36 / 52) in the 11 - 15 year old children than that in the 1 - 5 year old ones (44. 9 %, 53 / 118). A significant difference was observed in the prevalence between the age groups (χ 2 = 10. 56, P= 0. 014). The prevalence of light intensity of infection (1 - 49 eggs/ 10 mL of urine) (86. 6 %) {{was significantly higher than}} that of heavy intensity of infection (≥ 50 eggs/ 10 mL of urine) (13. 3 %) in the area (t= 16. 48, P= 0. 000). Water contact activities of the children revealed that children that were involved in irrigation and those that went swimming in water bodies were observed to be at higher risk of becoming infected with urinary schistosomiasis in the area with odd ratios (risk factors) of 2. 756 (1. 334 - 5. 693) and 2. 366 (1. 131 - 4. 948) respectively at P< 0. 05 level. ConclusionsThe study revealed the hyperendemicity of urinary schistosomiasis in the pre-school and school aged children in Guma Local Government Area.

Not all prey species represent identical risks of infection for cats because {{of differences in}} prey susceptibility, exposure and/or lifespan. Previously published {{studies have shown that}} prevalence in rodent and lagomorph species is positively correlated with body mass. We tested the hypothesis that different prey species have different infection risks by comparing infection dynamics of feral cats at 4 sites in the sub-Antarctic Kerguelen archipelago which differed in prey availability. Cats were trapped from 1994 to 2004 and anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies were detected using the modified agglutination test (> or = 1 : 40). Overall seroprevalence was 51. 09 %. Antibody prevalence differed between sites, depending on diet and also on sex, after taking into account the effect of age. <b>Males</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> often <b>infected</b> than females and the difference between the sexes tended to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> pronounced in the site where <b>more</b> prey species <b>were</b> available. A difference in predation efficiency between male and female cats may explain this result.

To estimate {{the presence of these}} pathogens in rodents in Finland, we examined blood samples from 151 bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and demonstrate, for the first time, that A. phagocytophilum and B. microti commonly infect bank voles (in 22 % and 40 % of animals, respectively) in Finland. Sequence analysis of a fragment of 18 S rRNA showed that the B. microti strain isolated was identical to the Munich strain, which is considered to be nonzoonotic. The A. phagocytophilum strain (based on a fragment of the msp 4 gene) was identical to one found earlier in rodents in the United Kingdom that is transmitted by the tick Ixodes trianguliceps, all the life stages of which feed on small mammals. The infection probability of B. microti in the bank voles was the greater the older the individual <b>was,</b> and <b>males</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> often <b>infected</b> than females. A. phagocytophilum infection probability first increased and then decreased with the age of individual without any difference between sexes.

Sociodemographic data and water contact activities were collated from children using structured questionnaires. Results. A point prevalence of 58. 54 % was reported out of the urine samples examined. <b>Males</b> <b>were</b> significantly <b>more</b> <b>infected</b> than their female counterparts (71. 15 % versus 43. 66 %, χ 2 = 89. 12, p= 0. 000). The age-related prevalence showed 6 – 10 and 11 – 15 years significantly infected with 78. 70 % and 73. 02 %, respectively (χ 2 = 89. 12, p= 0. 000). Light intensity of infection, 62. 51 %, was significantly higher than heavy intensity, 37. 48 %, among the infected children (χ 2 = 365. 8, p= 0. 000). Water contact activities such as fishing (OR = 4. 01, CI = 3. 04 – 5. 61, p= 0. 000), rice farming (OR = 4. 01, CI = 2. 96 – 5. 36, p= 0. 000), and dry season farming (OR = 4. 78, CI = 3. 68 – 6. 22, p= 0. 000) were the risk factors exposing children to infection in the area.

40|$|As a major {{biological}} {{model for}} biomedical research, maintaining healthy zebrafish (Danio rerio) is imperative for accurate and consistent lab results. This retrospective study focuses on Pseudoloma neurophilia, a microsporidium, {{because it is}} the most common pathogen found in laboratory zebrafish. An online database maintained by the Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC) contains data on thousands of zebrafish submitted to their diagnostic laboratory since 2000. Zebrafish samples were examined in order to find sex related patterns, which may point to potential factors that contribute to increased chances of having P. neurophilia. Sex, clinical status (sick or apparently healthy), and presence of the infection based on histopathology were analyzed for any potential correlation between sex, P. neurophilia, with comparisons between sick and healthy fish. Data compiling resulted in a chi-square test p-value of 0. 0045, indicating that there exists a strong correlation that <b>male</b> zebrafish <b>are</b> <b>more</b> often <b>infected</b> with P. neurophilia. References suggest a wide variety of causes. However, a main contributor to increased infection may be an increased level of stress in males compared to females. This study serves as an analysis into ZIRC submissions of zebrafish infected with P. neurophilia and determining the potential variation in infection rates and degree of severities between zebrafish sexes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This study {{describes}} the clinical features, diagnosis, {{and treatment of}} rhinosporidiosis of the eye and its adnexa {{in a series of}} 76 cases in Nepal and six originating in India. The disease caused by the fungus Rhino-sporidium seeberi was seen most frequently in young children between eight and 10 years of age. <b>Males</b> <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> <b>more</b> than females (2. 5 : 1). The conjunctiva was the most common site of infection in 76 (92. 68 %) of the cases. The lacrimal sac was affected only in six (7. 32 %) cases. Simple total excision of the conjunctival polyps gave highly satisfactory results in cases of conjunctival sac infections. Except for one patient, there were no recurrences in the 76 cases. Meticulous excision of polyps provided a satisfactory result in the treatment of six cases with lacrimal sac infection. Recurrence was noted in one of these six cases followed up to {{two and a half years}} after surgery. The conditions diagnosed clinically were confirmed by histopathology. This review of 82 cases is the first such report of rhinosporidiosis from Nepal. Rhinosporidiosis is a chronic and localized infection of the mucus membranes caused by the fungus Rhinosporidium seeberi. The fungus forms round and thick-walled sporangia in the submucosa of the affected site, varying from 10 to 200 mm in size, which are visible as white dots in the mu...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{found an}} {{unexpectedly}} high prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni {{in a village}} in the Upper Egyptian governorate of Giza. Historically, S. mansoni is endemic in the northern Egyptian Nile Delta {{rather than in the}} southern Upper Egypt. This observation was made during an evaluation of a rural health care schistosomiasis surveillance program using a cross sectional survey for S. haematobium and S. mansoni in the village of El-Gezira El-Shakra El-Saf district in the Upper Egypt Giza Governorate. A 10 % systematic random sample of households of the village was chosen. All persons in the selected houses were invited to submit urine and stool samples. All students from a primary school were also included in the study. Urine was screened by a polycarbonate filtration method and stool was examined using modified Kato-Katz technique. The prevalence of S. mansoni in the population sample and in the school children was 33. 7 % and 57. 7 %, respectively, whereas the prevalence of S. haematobium infection in the population sample and the school children was 7. 4 % and 10. 6 %, respectively. The prevalence of infection was highest in the younger age groups, and <b>males</b> <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> <b>more</b> than females. Review of Ministry of Health records showed that both species of vector snails, Bulinus truncatus and Biomphalaria alexandrina, were present from 1991 to 1995, and that B. alexandrina <b>was</b> <b>more</b> abundant than B. truncatus in the canals surrounding this village. The unexpected high prevalence of S. mansoni in this village indicates an urgent need to include training programs for S. mansoni surveillance in the primary health care facilities of Giza and to educate villagers to request examinations for S...|$|R

Out of the 274 elephants examined, 36. 86 % were infected. Of the 178 males examined, 35. 96 % harboured Strongyloides, Coccidia and Strongyles with worm burdens of 75. 6 ± 0. 3, 125. 2 ± 1. 4 and 420. 2 ± 0. 1, respectively. Among the males, the larvae of Strongyloides papillosus were recovered from those infected with Strongyloides while Haemonchus contortus, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Murshidia species and Oesophagostomum columbianum were recovered from those infected with Strongyles. Those infected with Coccidia yielded Eimeria bovis. Of the 96 females examined, 38. 54 % were infected with Coccidia and Strongyle s with 102. 2 ± 0. 7 Oocysts per Gram of faeces (OPG) and 360. 2 ± 0. 1 Eggs per Gram of faeces (EPG), respectively. The helminth larvae recovered from the females infected with Strongyles were; H. contortus, O. columbianum and Murshidia species, while those infected with Coccidia yielded E. bovis. Out of the 213 adults examined, 27. 23 % were infected with Strongyloides and Strongyles with 187. 3 ± 0. 4 and 208. 4 ± 0. 1 EPG, respectively. The larvae of S. papillosus were recovered from those infected with Strongyloides, while the larvae of H. contortus, O. columbianum, T. colubriformis and Murshidia were recovered from those infected with Strongyles.

40|$|Summary {{objective}} To {{demonstrate the}} importance of surveillance systems in detecting emerging diseases and highlighting {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of an existing one. methods The Orissa multi-disease surveillance system (OMDSS) was introduced in November 1999. Reporting units from the periphery send data to the district on a weekly basis. These reports are analysed regularly. A district task force (DTF) was available to intervene in the event of an outbreak. The OMDSS detected an increasing number of cases with fever and jaundice in June 2002. The DTF investigated this outbreak using clinical, epidemiological and laboratory tools to identify its cause. results This outbreak, in a remote corner of India, was detected within 4 days by an existing sur-veillance system. Action was initiated within 24 h, but it took approximately two more weeks for the causative agent to be diagnosed. A total of 143 people were suspected to have leptospirosis between 23 June 2002 and 31 July 2002. The attack rate was 5. 95 % and the case fatality ratio (CFR) was 7. 69 %, both lower than outbreaks reported elsewhere in India. While <b>males</b> <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> <b>more</b> often than females, the CFR was higher among females and among the 6 – 15 year age groups. Exposure to infected water in a canal was the probable cause of the outbreak. IgM antibodies were positive in 33 of the patients and six patients tested positive for PCR and culture. Leptospirosis interrogans serovar canicola, Leptospirosis interrogans serovar pomona and Leptospirosis interrogans serovar hebdomadis were isolated. conclusions Leptospirosis is a new disease in this region of India. This outbreak was detected and diagnosed because of the surveillance system. The prompt response helped in containing the outbreak early enough. However, the morbidity and mortality could have been further mitigated if the delays in transmitting information had been minimized. An adequate laboratory support would have also helped considerably. We conclude stressing {{the importance of}} surveillance as a public health tool...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Paragonimiasis have {{previously}} {{been reported in}} two zones of the Southwest Province of Cameroon including the Kupe mountain and Mundani foci. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the presence and epidemiology of paragonimiasis in the peri-urban zone of Kumba, Meme Division, located about 50 km away from the Kupe mountain focus. Methods Pupils of several government primary schools in 5 villages around Kumba underwent both parasitologic and clinical investigations in search of signs and symptoms of paragonimiasis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was also searched for in the differential diagnosis. Freshwater crabs from neighbouring streams in the five villages were dissected in search of paragonimus metacercariae. Results Out of a total of 1482 pupils examined in all five villages, 309 individuals (147 males and 162 females) were recruited for this study based on the presence of one or more signs or symptoms of paragonimiasis. Eggs of Paragonimus africanus were found in stools and/or sputum of pupils from all five villages, giving an overall paragonimus prevalence of 2. 56 %. There was no significant difference in the disease prevalence between the villages (X 2 = 8. 36, P = 0. 08). The prevalence of Paragonimus africanus eggs amongst pupils with symptoms of paragonimiasis was 12. 3 % (38 of 309). <b>Males</b> <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> <b>more</b> than females (17. 0 % versus 8. 0 %), but the difference was not significant (X 2 = 5. 76, P = 0. 16). All the 38 paragonimus egg positive subjects presented with cough, 23 (60. 53 %) complained of chest pain while 16 (42. 11 %) had haemoptysis. Stool examinations also detected some intestinal parasites including Ascaris lumbricoides (29. 45 %), Trichuris trichiura (6. 47 %), Necator americanus (2. 27 %), Strongyloides stercoralis (1. 62 %), Enterobius vermicularis (0. 65 %), and Entamoeba histolytic a (4. 53 %). No case of M. tuberculosis was noted. Out of a total of 85 dissected crabs (Sudanonautes africanus), 6. 02 % were infected with paragonimus metacercariae. Conclusion In addition to the two previously described paragonimiasis foci of Kupe mountain and Mundani, the identification of autochthonous cases of paragonimiasis in the peri-urban zone of Kumba town, makes the South West Province the most endemic zone of paragonimiasis in Cameroon at present. </p...|$|R
