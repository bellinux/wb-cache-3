25|$|When a {{security}} is sold, the seller is contractually obliged {{to deliver it}} to the buyer. If a seller sells {{a security}} short without owning it first, the seller must borrow the security from a third party to fulfill its obligation. Otherwise, the seller fails to deliver, the transaction does not settle, and the seller {{may be subject to}} a claim from its counterparty. Certain large holders of securities, such as a custodian or investment management firm, often lend out these securities to gain extra income, a process known as securities lending. The lender receives a fee for this service. Similarly, retail investors can sometimes make an extra fee when their broker wants to borrow their securities. This is only possible when the investor has full title of the security, so it cannot be used as collateral for <b>margin</b> <b>buying.</b>|$|E

There are many uncertain factors {{during the period from}} the announcement date to the base day. Therefore, this research summarized main risk which resulted from bidding company and target company. Methodology is based on Piotroski''s(2000) F-Score model, additionally adding some risk factors as MA_Score, expecting to be a reference for risk level of every M&A cases. The second segment discuss whether market return, interest rate, volatilities of net trading from Institutional Investors, and volatilities of <b>margin</b> <b>buy</b> and sell volumes have influences on M&A arbitrage profit. First, for all samples, there is no profit in M&A arbitraging. But separate whole samples into three parts, discovering that in Stage I and Stage II the return is negative, and in Stage III the arbitrage return would be 19 %. And the regression results revealed that all variables do not have significant effects on M&A arbitrage profit before meeting of shareholders. After meeting of shareholders, market return, volatilities of <b>margin</b> <b>buy</b> and sell volumes have significant effects on M&A arbitrage profit, it also means that the market is inefficiency. 本研究主要分析併購所產生的風險，並探討影響併購套利報酬的因素，樣本為 1999 年到 2009 年在台灣發生的併購案。 併購案從宣告日開始到基準日結束之間，平均有半年的時間，期間會有許多因素會影響到併購案的成敗，本研究整理出幾項主要的併購風險，有來自主併公司的風險也有來自被併公司的風險，參考Piotroski（ 2000 ）的F_Score模型再加入併購風險因子成為MA_Score來分析併購風險。 利用迴規模型探討大盤報酬率、利率、三大法人買賣超變動率與散戶的融資券變動率等總體因素是否會影響到併購套利報酬。實證結果發現，全部樣本的平均套利報酬率為 0 %，但分三段期間探討，發現Stage I與Stage II的套利報酬率是負值，而Stage III產生正的套利報酬率，年報酬率有 19 %。另外，股東會召開前，所有變數皆不顯著，市場是有效率的；股東會之後，顯著的變數是大盤報酬率與散戶的融資融券變動率，表示市場處於非理性狀態。目錄 第一章 緒論	 1 第一節	研究動機	 1 第二節	研究目的	 1 第二章 文獻回顧	 3 第一節 併購風險	 3 第二節 併購套利報酬率	 4 第三節 機構投資人交易對股價報酬率的影響	 4 第三章 研究方法與設計	 6 第一節 併購風險分析	 6 第二節 併購套利報酬分析	 9 第四章 實證分析	 13 第一節 併購風險分析	 13 第二節 併購套利報酬分析	 14 第三節 相關性分析	 16 第五章 結論與建議	 17 第一節 結論	 17 第二節 建議	 18 參考資料	 1...|$|R

50|$|In <b>margin</b> <b>buying,</b> the trader borrows money (at interest) {{to buy a}} {{stock and}} hopes for it to rise. Most industrialized {{countries}} have regulations that require that if the borrowing is based on collateral from other stocks the trader owns outright, {{it can be a}} maximum of a certain percentage of those other stocks' value.

50|$|Margin lending {{also known}} as <b>margin</b> <b>buying</b> or {{leveraged}} equities have all the same attributes as physical shares discussed earlier, but {{with the addition of}} leverage, which means like CFDs, futures, and options much less capital is required, but risks are increased. Since the advent of CFDs, many traders have moved from margin lending to CFD trading. The main benefits of CFD versus margin lending are that there are more underlying products, the margin rates are lower, and it is easy to go short. Even with the recent bans on short selling, CFD providers who have been able to hedge their book in other ways have allowed clients to continue to short sell those stocks.|$|E

50|$|When {{it comes}} to {{financing}} a purchase of stocks there are two ways: purchasing stock with money that is currently in the buyer's ownership, or by buying stock on <b>margin.</b> <b>Buying</b> stock on margin means buying stock with money borrowed against the value of stocks in the same account. These stocks, or collateral, guarantee that the buyer can repay the loan; otherwise, the stockbroker {{has the right to}} sell the stock (collateral) to repay the borrowed money. He can sell if the share price drops below the margin requirement, at least 50% {{of the value of the}} stocks in the account. Buying on margin works the same way as borrowing money to buy a car or a house, using a car or house as collateral. Moreover, borrowing is not free; the broker usually charges 8-10% interest.|$|E

The average P/E (price to earnings) ratio of S&P Composite stocks was 32.6 in September 1929, clearly above historical norms.Good harvests had built up a mass of 250 million bushels of wheat to be [...] "carried over" [...] when 1929 opened. By May there was also a winter-wheat crop of 560 million bushels ready for harvest in the Mississippi Valley. This oversupply caused a drop in wheat prices so heavy that the net incomes of the farming population from wheat were threatened with extinction. Stock markets are always sensitive to the future state of commodity markets, and the slump in Wall Street predicted for May by Sir George Paish arrived on time. In June 1929, the position was saved by a severe drought in the Dakotas and the Canadian West, plus unfavorable seed times in Argentina and eastern Australia. The oversupply would now be wanted to fill the big gaps in the 1929 world wheat production. From 97¢ per bushel in May, the price of wheat rose to $1.49 in July. When it was seen that at this figure the American farmers would get rather more for their smaller crop than for that of 1928, up went stocks again and from far and wide orders came to buy shares for the profits to come.|$|E

40|$|The classic {{prescription}} for hedging the market {{risk associated with}} derivatives positions is to restrict the possible process dynamics sufficiently so that the payoff can be spanned by (completely) dynamic trading in the underlying asset(s). This approach introduces model risk. • We explore alternative strategies for hedging claims written on the price path of a single underlying asset. • When many derivatives trade on the same underlying asset’s price path, there can be multiple perfect hedges under the restricted process dynamics. • We find that for some claims, some of these alternative hedges succeed when the restrictions are lifted. 3 Robust Hedging • A robust hedge strategy is one that theoretically works for a wide class of models. • For example, PCP implies that {{the sale of a}} European call can be robustly hedged by buying the underlying stock on <b>margin</b> and also <b>buying</b> the right put. • As the example shows, robust hedging strategies typically work only for a small class of claims being hedged. Also, they succeed even under stochastic volatility and jumps. In fact, they succeed even though volatility of volatility and the jump arrival rates are unknown. Hence, model risk is largely overcome. • There may need to be some restrictions on the stochastic process for the underlying asset price. For example, a long forward position can be robustly replicated by buying and borrowing only by assuming that dividends are suitably restricted. • Robust hedging strategies {{may or may not be}} (fully) dynamic...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} impact of {{regulation}} allowing short selling and margin trading in the Chinese equity market. The first essay examines {{the impact of}} the implementation of short selling and margin trading on March 31, 2010 and its impact on stock prices, liquidity, and volatility of pilot programme A-shares. The results suggest that prices of pilot A-shares decline relative to matched Chinese A-shares and cross-listed Hong Kong H-shares, which suggests that the effect of short selling is greater than <b>margin</b> <b>buying.</b> However, inconsistent with developed markets evidence and the perspective of Chinese regulators, this essay finds a significant decline in liquidity following the short selling and margin trading activity. A possible explanation for this result is a reluctance to invest in pilot programme A-shares by less informed investors in the presence of better informed counterparts. The second essay uses an event study approach to examine abnormal stock returns and trading volume surrounding the key short selling and margin trading programme announcement date on February 12, 2010 and its subsequent implementation on March 31, 2010 for the pilot A-shares. Regression analysis is also conducted to investigate which factors are influencing the observed abnormal returns. The event study presents evidence of negative price reaction and lower trading volume following both the announcement and implementation of short selling and margin trading for eligible stocks. The lower abnormal returns are consistent with the overvaluation hypothesis, however, the decline in trading activity is contrary to developed market evidence. Lower trading activity implies higher risk of information asymmetry existing in China. The final essay examines the effect of short selling and margin trading on efficiency, characteristics of stock return distributions, and price clustering for eligible securities during both the initial short selling and margin trading pilot programme phase on March 31, 2010, as well as, the programme’s extension to a wider group of securities on the December 5, 2011. The main findings are that there is no consistent improvement in pricing efficiency across the different measures after the introduction and subsequent expansion of short selling and <b>margin</b> <b>buying.</b> The positive skewness of abnormal returns is reduced, which is consistent with the prediction of theoretical models. We also find some evidence that price clustering on average declines for the eligible stocks...|$|E
40|$|Trading {{at prices}} above the {{fundamental}} {{value of an}} asset, i. e. a bubble, has been verified and replicated in laboratory asset markets {{for the past seven}} years. To date, only common group experience provides minimal conditions for common investor sentiment and trading at fundamental value. Rational expectations models do not predict the bubble and crash phenomena found in these experimental markets; such models yield only equilibrium predictions and do not articulate a dynamic process that converges to fundamental value with experience. The dynamic models proposed by Caginalp et al. do an excellent job of predicting price patterns after calibration with a previous experimental bubble, given the initial conditions for a new bubble and its controlled fundamental value. Several extensions of this basic laboratory asset market have recently been undertaken which allow for <b>margin</b> <b>buying,</b> short selling, futures contracting, limit price change rules {{and a host of other}} changes that could effect price formation in these assets markets.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of how one should invest for retirement, {{focusing}} on the risk/return tradeoff that must be made over time. In particular, we are interested in the use of financial instruments which 1 leverage — instruments which amplify both the potential gain from an investment but also increase the potential loss. <b>Margin</b> <b>buying</b> — the act of borrowing money and reinvesting it in the market — is one such leveraging scheme. Financial options/futures are another one. These schemes are now widely available to common investors, and we seek to understand how they can improve an investors utility. Rather than pose a sophisticated consumption and utility model (which often includes trade offs for spending vs. leisure time, bequest-ing money to children, discounting, history dependent consumption, etc), we study an unadorned model in order to examine the core as-pects of how to leverage. In particular, we consider a model where the decision is to work or not — while working, both saving and spend-ing occur and while not working, only spending occurs. The utility model we consider seeks to minimize the number of years worked. Our results are a mixture of theory, where we characterize many as-pects of the optimal policy, and simulation, where we use dynamic programming techniques to estimate optimal values. Importantly, we calibrate our model using parameters for the mean and variance of the market’s return which are estimated from historical data. With these realistic figures, we find that the optimal strategy while working is highly leveraged. While traditional retirement funds hold around 70 % market and 30 % bonds (say at around halfway to retirement), our optimal strategy holds around 200 % market and − 100 % cash (i. e. it is borrowing money to invest in the market). Using such a leveraged strategy can decrease the time to retirement by over 10 years. 2...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} 10 years the cut {{of health and}} social {{services}} and the cut of public investment in housing policy have increase the unsatisfied social requirements of the population. This occurred when the Great Recession, which was triggered by a financial meltdown that started in the United States and spread rapidly across the globe, and has inflicted from 2008 the economic crisis on children. The {{gap between rich and}} poor families has widened in an alarming number of industrialized countries. The Innocenti Report Card series show, in the past five years, rising numbers of children and their families have experienced difficulty in satisfying their most basic material and educational needs. In this scenario the families with children that live in critical and uncomfortable situation are increasing. Often the situations is so critical and alarming that much more is the numbers of children turned away from the family to ensure his well-being. Starting from an analysis of the young people and his situation post crisis, the study translate the results of some recent local research about children needs and his unsatisfied social requirements, into a new model of younger housing that could prevent the long term stay in traditional structure for children removed from families and at the same time, meet the contemporary housing needs. The welfare system is called to review his priority of children services and first of all to design new social tools, like residential and semi-residential community for removed children, to answer at a new educational project, made of integration and temporary solutions. It’s necessary to rethinking the structures for children removed like “space of transition” in which the children stay like in a big family but to return in his own regenerated family as soon as possible. An event so relevant have meaningful economic and social effect that necessarily involve also a changed and new thought “architectural-design” of the system properties usability and of the re-planning and temporary reuse of the houses and spaces. The study focused on a real pilot-case based on public property in the Municipality of RO, Emilia Romagna. The idea is to think up an integrated system economic-technical/design-social that allow a new welfare system to be able to transform the assistance children’s needs into places and spaces economically sustainable, usable and that valorized the property public and private, creating virtuous net of solidarity, economic, fairness with temporary residences and proximity service. The aim is to identify new common tools and languages between architectural children temporary housing projects and the social project for young people, integrated in a temporary and proximity model. Temporary reuse of space becomes sustainable strategy because it introduces a significant new concept of use of the social assistance residence: not only space for integration and most secure residence, in which to put the children, but a new place of temporary living, in which children it is educated and integrated into a community along with others, in a physical and spatial transition, confidential place regenerated for the common use. Proximity, realized with a participatory-inductive method for the stakeholders and proximity in the architectural project, changing parting elements into architectural elements of inclusion: borders and margins are areas of proximity, hybrid, in which the meeting also social happens. It therefore introduces a new regenerative potential, not only space today unused and disposal of public property, but a much more interesting and explosive social mix, capable of intercepting social need, planning services, community response and lower costs. Create of light intervention strategies, which, through a minimal impact, work on the spaces left vacant. It now intends to work on the concept of proximity: social and architectural. Social through a new concept of understanding the detention of minors in public structures that include social integration processes, architectural in which the common indoor and outdoor spaces (gardens, spaces for socializing as for the well-being of the body or recreation) becomes an interesting system in the definition of barrier, no longer understood as a border or boundary, but as <b>margin</b> <b>buying</b> thick and that is modulated to meet the different requirements of use. Border and margin are concepts that refer to a variety of situations that are adjacent to something that is physically recognizable.
