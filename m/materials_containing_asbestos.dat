50|$|Friability of {{a product}} {{containing}} asbestos means {{that it is so}} soft and weak in structure that it can be broken with simple finger crushing pressure. Friable materials are of the most initial concern because of their ease of damage. The forces or conditions of usage that come into intimate contact with most non-friable <b>materials</b> <b>containing</b> <b>asbestos</b> are substantially higher than finger pressure.|$|E
50|$|Residential {{building}} <b>materials</b> <b>containing</b> <b>asbestos</b> {{include a}} variety of products, such as: stipple used in textured walls and ceilings; drywall joint filler compound; asbestos contaminated vermiculite, vinyl floor tile; vinyl sheet flooring; window putty; mastic; cement board; asbestos cement pipes and flues; furnace tape; and stucco. Asbestos is widely used in roofing materials, mainly corrugated asbestos cement roof sheets and asbestos shingles sometimes called transite. Other sources of asbestos-containing materials include fireproofing and acoustic materials.|$|E
50|$|Some DPC <b>materials</b> may <b>contain</b> <b>asbestos</b> fibres. This {{was more}} {{commonly}} found in the older, grey sealants as well as flexible tar boards.|$|R
50|$|Asbestos {{exposure}} {{becomes an}} issue if <b>asbestos</b> <b>containing</b> <b>materials</b> become airborne, such as due to deterioration or damage. Building occupants may {{be exposed to}} asbestos, but those most at risk are persons who purposely disturb materials, such as maintenance or construction workers. Housekeeping or custodial employees may be at an increased risk as they may potentially clean up damaged or deteriorated <b>asbestos</b> <b>containing</b> <b>materials</b> without knowing that the <b>material</b> <b>contains</b> <b>asbestos.</b> Asbestos abatement or remediation workers and emergency personnel such as firefighters may also become exposed. Asbestos-related diseases have been diagnosed in asbestos workers' family members, and in residents who live close to asbestos mines or processing plants.|$|R
50|$|Workers from Con Ed, {{the major}} utility {{company at the}} time, were {{repairing}} a high pressure steam pipe {{in front of the}} building when a 30 in connecting sleeve burst, releasing hot steam and debris upwards. Laboratory testing afterwards determined that the insulating <b>material</b> <b>contained</b> <b>asbestos,</b> which subsequently led to a large-scale evacuation and cleanup. The release from the explosion, in front of 32 Gramercy Park at the corner of 20th Street and Third Avenue, continued for several hours with debris reaching 18 stories. The pipe was covered with asbestos magnesia block insulation which was pulverized and dispersed with the rising steam cloud.|$|R
50|$|As chief {{advisor to}} this conference, Schmidheiny created a forum in which leading {{businessmen}} {{from all parts}} of the world developed a business perspective on environment and development challenges. This forum later became the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), an organization that today counts the world’s 160 most important companies as its members. Schmidheiny was elected honorary chairman, in recognition of his pioneering role in the phase-out of production of building <b>materials</b> <b>containing</b> <b>asbestos.</b>|$|E
50|$|Up until {{summer of}} 2005, {{the school had}} 13 {{portable}} buildings. However, in 2005, Mississauga Secondary School opened {{in the area and}} about half of the grade 9 and 10 students attending Streetsville had to switch schools due to boundary changes. This dropped the overall attendance by about 500, and all of the portables have been removed. The sole portable remaining was used {{as an extension of the}} school's drama room until it was removed in 2006 due to budget cuts. In 2015, the roof of the portapac collapsed due to flooding after a heavy rainstorm. Mold was discovered within the portapac and as such, it was boarded up. 3 portables have been added to the back of the school to replace the portapac, which was removed during the $7 million renovation/expansion that the school underwent during the summer of 2015 and the 2015-16 school year that included the removal of all <b>materials</b> <b>containing</b> <b>asbestos</b> from the building as well as installing new windows throughout the building. The portapac was replaced with a permanent extension to the school.|$|E
5000|$|Goor (Dutch for: low, swampy land) {{achieved}} city {{rights in}} 1263. An important city, however, it never became. The [...] "Drost" [...] ( [...] {{a kind of}} mayor) of the Twente region, who ruled this area in behalf of the bishop of Utrecht, had in the late Middle Ages his residence in Goor. In its surroundings some castles were built, among them {{the house of the}} important Heeckeren family in 1412. Goor had a small harbour along the river Regge ( [...] which flows to the Vecht near Ommen), but when the Twente canal was opened in 1936, a new industrial port was built there. The factory Eternit, that produces building <b>materials</b> <b>containing</b> <b>asbestos,</b> brought Goor unwillingly into trouble. For decades, everyone in Goor was permitted to use production refuse containing asbestos in order to pave their own paths and roads. Not earlier than about 1990, it was known in Goor that especially small particles of this material can cause cancer. In major parts of the city the soil has to be removed and either cleaned or replaced by non-polluted material.|$|E
40|$|To inform State {{agencies}} which occupy State-owned and leased {{buildings that}} they must provide to employees written notification {{of the presence of}} known <b>Asbestos</b> <b>Containing</b> <b>Materials</b> (ACM) and Presumed <b>Asbestos</b> <b>Containing</b> <b>Materials</b> (PACM). In most cases, buildings built after 1980 were built without <b>Asbestos</b> <b>Containing</b> <b>Materials.</b> In cases where {{there is reason to believe}} a <b>material</b> <b>contains</b> <b>asbestos</b> then such <b>material</b> must be either considered an <b>Asbestos</b> <b>Containing</b> <b>Material</b> or must be tested and proved otherwise. This annual notification process generally occurs in January of each year, based on prior notices. (State Administrative Manual Section 2591) Who is Affected All employees working in buildings with known ACM or PACM shall be informed of asbestos conditions within the first 15 days of their employment. If new information concerning ACM or PACM has been obtained, all employees working in the building shall be provided a supplemental notice within 15 days of receipt of new information...|$|R
50|$|In February 2008 a {{substance}} {{thought to be}} asbestos was found below a heating pipe. The school was closed for several days while the material, air samples {{and some of the}} insulation were tested. According to a follow-up report by CBC North, the pipe insulation, the air samples and the <b>material</b> did not <b>contain</b> <b>asbestos.</b>|$|R
40|$|In our republic, {{occupational}} exposure to asbestos has been restricted to jobs concerned with disposal of products, <b>materials</b> and buildings <b>containing</b> <b>asbestos,</b> and research work studying asbestos fibres. The reason consists in health risks as {{all kinds of}} asbestos belong to high-risk carcinogens. The asbestos fibre related diseases should be reported. All data connected are kept in the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) in Prague. The {{purpose of this study}} was to find out how much people are aware of the risks related to asbestos and find people who suffered from asbestos dust-induced disease, i. e. mesothelioma of pleura. The quantitative method was used to summarise information on asbestos-induced disease occurence in 1970 - 2010 available in the National Institute of Public Health in Prague. Along with that, the work maps the population awareness of asbestos risks. The thesis itself can be divided into two parts. The first one contains information based on data collection while the other part deals with data of NIPH in Prague. Two hypotheses were predicted: Hypothesis H 1 : People are aware of the <b>material</b> <b>containing</b> <b>asbestos.</b> Hypothesis H 2 : People are aware of negative impact of asbestos on human health. Both hypotheses were proved. Three hypotheses were suggested in the other part: Hypothesis H 3 : Latency, the time between first exposure to manifestation of disease, is never less than 20 years. Hypothesis H 4 : Incidence of mesothelioma of pleura and peritoneum is higher in people aged 60 - 69. Hypothesis H 5 : Smoking affects the course of the disease negatively. Hypotheses H 3 and H 4 were proved. Hypothesis H 5 cannot be neither proved or disproved. Although the number of smokers among mesothelioma patients was higher, there is no evidence of negative effect of smoking on the disease. To prove this hypothesis, the data colllection should be larger. Findings of the study proved the time of exposure to asbestos fibres does not affect the occurence of this disease. The findings can be used in further research studies...|$|R
40|$|<b>Materials</b> <b>containing</b> <b>asbestos</b> {{were found}} in 75 per cent of 336 Vermont Schools {{constructed}} or renovated between 1946 and 1974, with two-fifths of the materials in student exposure areas. Findings from visits to all schools contrasted with an earlier investigation relying on self-reporting. Of 105 schools with student exposure disclosed by the current survey, only eight had been identified in the earlier effort. Ceiling tiles, previously not believed to contain substantial asbestos material, constituted a source of student exposure in 36 schools...|$|E

40|$|Diseases {{associated}} with asbestos are {{prevalent in the}} construction trades primarily {{as the result of}} the previously widespread use of insulation <b>materials</b> <b>containing</b> <b>asbestos</b> in the building industry. Workers in metal related trades, who are employed at construction sites, but who do not routinely use such materials in their work, may also be at risk for asbestos hazards. To assess such risk, a clinical survey was conducted on 869 ironworkers from the New York metropolitan area. A high prevalence of abnormalities on chest radiographs was found. Three hundred and twenty nine (38 %) of the examined workers had pleural abnormalities on their chest radiographs consistent with asbestos induced effects. The prevalence of radiographic abnormalities indicating interstitial lung disease was low (7 %) as was the prevalence of restrictive pulmonary function impairment (7 %). Association was found between forced vital capacity (FVC) and pleural abnormalities on chest radiographs. Although ex-smokers appeared to have the highest prevalence of abnormalities, regression analyses showed that duration of employment in the ironworkers' trade was the most important factor {{associated with}} them...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} the abatement process on homes in Portland, Oregon through the analysis of asbestos surveys conducted by The City of Portland. It evaluates the levels of hazardous materials that are left in homes after the abatement process which can be disbursed into the air and soil during demolition and thus create significant health hazards for demolition crews and surrounding residents. The research methods employed for this paper include the analysis of asbestos surveys on homes provided by The Rebuilding Center of Portland (The Rebuilding Center) to see what <b>materials</b> <b>contained</b> <b>asbestos.</b> The surveys were used to compile data on the number of homes deconstructed that were found to have additional asbestos after abatement. This data was examined for trends. The results show that 52 % of homes examined by The Rebuilding Center had additional asbestos found after abatement. This was commonly found in materials like flooring and vinyl tiles which can be hard to find during surveys if they are hidden underneath other materials such as carpet. Both material surveys and abatement procedures are required for all homes that are to be demolished in Portland, but many hazardous materials remain after this process, making demolition unsafe. This paper contends that deconstruction is a much safer alternative since no debris is created and hazardous materials can be disposed of properly when found. These findings contributed to new regulations in Portland, Oregon that require deconstruction rather than demolition for homes built before the year 1916...|$|R
40|$|Asbestos {{is these}} days {{classified}} as carcinogen of the 1 rst category. That {{is why it}} is prohibited to use asbestos in practice. The exception is made for the maintaining of the objects, during their demolition, reconstruction or construction. The main criteria of its health dangerousness are length and average of the fibres for inhalation. The fibres longer than 5 - 8 µm and narrower than 1, 5 µm are considered as a high risk. The most effected category at danger is especially a staff in the building industries and in maintaining or cleaning jobs. Those people are exposed to the risk of inhalation of the fibres released to atmosphere. This occurs especially by drilling, cutting and refracting <b>materials</b> that <b>contain</b> <b>asbestos.</b> For that reason t is very important to care on rigorously prevention of the inhalation and contamination of the atmosphere and the environment by using appropriate protection aids, staff training and carry on the preventive medical examination...|$|R
5000|$|Over 120,000 {{cubic yards}} (92,000 m³) of {{sediment}} from the landslide each year is deposited into Swift Creek. Due {{to the large}} amount of sediment being deposited in the creek, dredging was undertaken to prevent the creek from flowing over roads and flooding houses. The sediment collected by dredging the creek was given away free to use for projects such as building housing foundations or to be used as fill. In 2006, EPA samples indicated that the dredged <b>material</b> <b>contains</b> chrysotile <b>asbestos</b> at up to 4%, with an average of 1.7%. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) commented on the application for a dredge permit, recommending that because of the potential health risks, dredged material at the site no longer be removed as {{it had been in the}} past, and that community education be continued to help prevent or minimize ongoing exposures to residents. Previously dredged materials remaining alongside the creek banks were sprayed with an EPA approved [...] "tackifier" [...] (tinted green) to keep asbestos from blowing off the surface.|$|R
40|$|Forty-one {{public schools}} in Colorado were drawn at random and {{surveyed}} for asbestos-containing materials. After bulk samples of possible asbestos materials from the schools were collected and analyzed, the K 2 asbestos screening {{test was used to}} eliminate samples that did not contain asbestos. Samples with positive results on the K 2 test were analyzed by an outside laboratory by polarized light microscopy. The risk of potential exposure presented by these materials was then assessed for each site from which a sample was taken. Of 113 samples collected, results were negative for asbestos for only 10. 6 percent by the K 2 test. Of the 101 samples for which results were positive, 56 actually contained 1 or more forms of asbestos. Twelve of these 56 samples were from sprayed material; the remaining 44 were from other <b>materials</b> <b>containing</b> <b>asbestos.</b> Of the 41 schools sampled, 31 had asbestos materials in one of more locations. The potential exposure values for these materials ranged from very low to very high, but the majority had high-exposure potentials. Estimates based on the survey of the 41 schools indicated that 63 to 89 percent of the {{public schools in}} Colorado have asbestos materials that present potentially serious hazards, not only to the children, teachers, and staff, but also to members of the community who use the school buildings after regular school hours...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{mortality}} rates among 1657 employees at two Ontario automotive parts factories that manufactured friction <b>materials</b> <b>containing</b> chrysotile <b>asbestos</b> was initiated {{in response to the}} workers' concerns about the effects of asbestos on their health. A total of 1194 men and 258 women had had their first potential exposure at least 10 years {{before the end of the}} study period; 563 of the men and 138 of the women had had such an exposure at least 20 years before the end of the study period. A significantly increased rate of death from laryngeal cancer and an elevated rate of death from lung cancer were observed in a cohort analysis. One or two deaths might have been due to pleural mesothelioma. There was no increase in the rate of death from gastrointestinal cancer or from nonmalignant respiratory disease. Case-control analysis showed no association between the risk of laryngeal or lung cancer and the total duration of employment (a surrogate for the extent of ambient exposure to asbestos or other workplace toxic substances) or employment in departments where asbestos had been used. An association between risk of death and occupational exposure is uncertain...|$|R
50|$|A February 1976 {{regulation}} on {{accidents in}} nuclear installations provided for interministerial coordination on measures {{to be taken}} “in the event of accidents and for the preparation of an emergency plan,” while a law of June 1976 provided for special measures for unemployed persons who {{reached the age of}} 60 and who had used up their rights to unemployment benefit. A law of December 1976 relaxed the conditions for exemption from national insurance contributions or entitlement to ·pay reduced contributions, and also extended entitlement to orphans' pensions “to illegitimate children whose mothers are dead and who have not been recognized by their fathers.” The Asbestos Decree of April 1977 prohibited the storage and use of crocidolite (blue asbestos) and <b>materials</b> or ·products <b>containing</b> crocidolite and also prohibited “ the spraying of asbestos or <b>materials</b> or products <b>containing</b> <b>asbestos</b> and their use for thermal insulation or for acoustic, preservative or decorative purposes.” In September 1977, regulations were issued “regarding the conditions under which young persons of 16 and over may exceptionally drive agricultural tractors.” In May 1977, a subsidy scheme for the placing of handicapped persons was introduced.|$|R

40|$|Asbestos {{is widely}} {{recognised}} {{as a serious}} hazard, and its industrial use is now banned within the UK, and EU, and strict regulations govern the use of older manufactured <b>materials</b> which may <b>contain</b> <b>asbestos.</b> However, asbestos is also a natural geological material, and may occur in museum collections as minerals or constituents of rock specimens. In the UK the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 (CAR 2012) provides the legal framework for the safe identification, use and disposal of asbestos. However, these regulations, and other EU regulations, provide no specific guidance on dealing with potentially asbestos-containing natural materials. CAR 2012 specifies just six asbestos minerals although {{a number of other}} minerals in museum collections are known to have asbestiform structures and be hazard-ous, including other amphiboles, and the zeolite erionite. Despite the lack of specific guid-ance, museums must comply with CAR 2012, and this paper outlines the professional ad-vice, training and procedures which may be needed for this. It provides guidance on identifi-cation of potential asbestos-bearing specimens and on procedures to document them and store them for future use, or to prepare them for professional disposal. It also makes sug-gestions how visitors, employees and others in a museum can be protected from asbestos as incoming donations and enquiries, managed {{in the event of an}} emergency, and safely included in displays...|$|R
25|$|Although not all {{vermiculite}} <b>contains</b> <b>asbestos,</b> {{some products}} {{were made with}} vermiculite that <b>contained</b> <b>asbestos</b> until the early 1990s. Vermiculite mines throughout the world are now regularly tested for it and are supposed to sell products that <b>contain</b> no <b>asbestos.</b> The former vermiculite mine in Libby, Montana, did have tremolite asbestos as well as winchite and richterite (both fibrous amphiboles) — in fact, it was formed underground through essentially the same geologic processes as the contaminants.|$|R

50|$|Many {{building}} {{materials used in}} both public and domestic premises prior to the banning of <b>asbestos</b> may <b>contain</b> <b>asbestos.</b> Those performing renovation works or DIY activities may expose themselves to asbestos dust. In the UK, use of Chrysotile asbestos was banned {{at the end of}} 1999. Brown and blue asbestos were banned in the UK around 1985.
