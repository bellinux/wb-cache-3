Relations between quality and environmental issues have been treated, since quality problems interfere on environmental impacts. In dairy system, {{according to a report}} on dairy cleaner production by FIESP (2008), processors are concerned especially with rational use of water, energy saving techniques and equipment, use of less toxic raw materials, recycling, water and effluent treatment. Some studies have highlighted the importance of agriculture (milk producers) when it comes to environmental problems along the chain, giving less relevance to dairy processing, packaging, consume phase and waste management. Thus, milk reception control in dairy companies is an important stage for environmental management. Considering the importance of coordination among agents, the aim of this paper was to analyze processor conduct concerning raw <b>material</b> <b>non-conformity,</b> linking quality and environmental issues. This qualitative research was accomplished through a study in a dairy plant in Paraná, which processes 200, 000 liters of milk per day and sells products nationally. The company works with 1, 500 milk suppliers on average. Legal requirements are followed along the process, and ISO 1400 implementation in the company is in progress. According to interviews with quality supervisor and industrial manager, {{one of the most important}} critical point is milk reception, and a number of non-conformities are controlled. The presence of antibiotics is the most relevant of them, since it results in material rejection. Other problems, such as acidity and cryoscopy, are less critical, since it is possible to direct input to co-products. Interviewees informed that a low amount of milk is contaminated with antibiotics (about 1 % of total input). Concerning antibiotic contamination, intensive training and constant visits have been developed with producers, especially to inform them about the risks of antibiotics and to help them solving those problems. Such quality non-conformity carries to an environmental problem, being the processor legally responsible for adequate destination of contaminated milk. In this case, we observed a coordination failure that could bring environmental impacts: contaminated milk is dyed to avoid the use in other plants, and it is delivered back to producer, who do not receive for that product. The company’s reverse logistics for those cases ends up there, and rural producer is in charge of adequate destination. So, processor does not have complete control on material disposal, opening space to environmental problems. Although little percentage of milks is rejected due to antibiotics, it represents about 60. 000 liters monthly, which is not insignificant. We conclude that, despite company’s policy directed to a proactive position through training course and visits, lack of coordination related to reverse logistics, being mainly treated as a quality problem, can cause serious environmental issues in that system. </p...|$|E
40|$|Nondestructive Testing (NDT) in the {{engineering}} community is normally associated with the objective to detect, to classify and to size <b>material</b> <b>non-conformities</b> { for instance beginning with nonmetallic inclusions of a size of some ten m in steel or Aluminum alloys up to so-called 'material defects' like macroscopic cracks of some mm size.

40|$|Innovations {{today and}} inventors in NDT are mainly {{concentrated}} on developing strategies generally reducing the quality costs. The {{objective is to}} overcome technical barriers preventing up to now a price reduction by introducing new production technologies concerning the systems, hardware and software. The objective can be met by a modular design of miniaturised hardware and software components, allowing a flexible application-specific design. Examples were presented to the innovation of multiple-channel UT-systems and especially to the announcement of lowcost phased array systems and transducers available innthe near future to a comparable price as nowadays conventional systems. This will contribute to a wider application of intelligent inspection with enchanced potential for better detection and sizing of <b>materials</b> <b>non-conformities.</b> The innovations will also promote the development of multiple-channel and low-cost monitoring systems used for online component- and plant-life management. Furthermore the innovations will speed-up the introduction of NDT/NDE into automated production lines for qualified and reliable process manitoring and control. By following these trends NDT/NDE will again contribute to an enchanced but more economic safety...|$|R
