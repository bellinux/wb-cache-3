But really I think that Booker felt he was being taken seriously in Europe, and it <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>think</b> of himself differently and improved the quality of his music. He needed the energy of the audience to feed off.|$|E

When his {{attempts}} to probe Chiron about his life result in silence, Kevin tells him that he's had a child with an ex-girlfriend and, although the relationship ended, he is fulfilled by {{his role as a}} father. Chiron proceeds to ask Kevin why he called him, to which Kevin plays a song on the jukebox that <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>think</b> of Chiron.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{experience}} in the ballet world, Henze had never before composed a subject in the romantic style which Ashton requested, however Ashton had been impressed by Henze's treatment of magical material in his opera König Hirsch. Henze attended many ballet performances at Covent Garden, frequently accompanied by Ashton who told him clearly what he liked {{and what he did}} not like in music for dance. Eventually the work was completed, but when Ashton heard a recording of the orchestrated score he realised {{that he would have to}} revise his ideas; the sustained orchestral sounds were such a contrast to the piano score and <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>think</b> very differently.|$|E

25|$|An Anglican {{priest of}} Irish extraction, {{he was born}} on St Patrick's Day, 17 March 1777. He was a bright young man and after being taught by the Rev. Thomas Tighe, he won a {{scholarship}} to St John's College, Cambridge, where he studied divinity and ancient and modern history. Attending Cambridge may have <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>think</b> his name was too Irish, and he changed its spelling to Brontë, perhaps in honour of Horatio Nelson who held the title of Duke of Bronte, whom Patrick admired. However, a more likely reason may have been that his brother, William, was 'on the run' from the British for his involvement with the United Irishmen {{and he wanted to}} distance himself from the name Prunty. Having obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree, he was ordained on 10 August 1806. He is the author of Cottage Poems (1811), The Rural Minstrel (1814), numerous pamphlets and newspaper articles, and various rural poems.|$|E

At Oxford, {{she met a}} young man named Tony Bray (1926–2014) who was impressed by her and later recalled that she was [...] "very thoughtful and a very good conversationalist. That's probably what interested me. She was good at general subjects". Her enthusiasm for politics as a girl <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>think</b> of her as [...] "unusual". Bray met Roberts' parents and described her father as [...] "slightly austere" [...] and [...] "totally correct" [...] and her mother as [...] "very proper" [...] and [...] "motherly".|$|E

While recording the album version, the record's producer Owen Morris cut out this intro {{and replaced it with}} a drumbeat played by McCarroll. Morris further cut a second section in Gallagher's guitar solo. Gallagher was bemused by Morris' decision, and jokingly asked him through manager Marcus Russell to [...] "not cut it in half again on the final mix". [...] Morris said that the removed part <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>think</b> of [...] "Slash in leather keks with a wind machine on the Grand Canyon".|$|E

500|$|The Pomegranates second review {{came from}} Pagan studies scholar Douglas Ezzy of the University of Tasmania, who praises Greenwood's research, {{theoretical}} approach {{and style of}} writing. He notes that her [...] "truly ground breaking" [...] approach in taking spiritual experiences seriously had [...] "fascinated and thrilled" [...] him, asserting that her work builds on the pioneering edited collection Being Changed by Jean-Guy Goulet and David E. Young. Noting that Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld was [...] "sometimes provocative", he disagrees with some of Greenwood's conclusions, but highlights that her arguments had <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>think</b> about these issues [...] "in much sharper focus." ...|$|E
500|$|Jason Hughes of The Huffington Post {{said that}} [...] "Everything about this premiere worked". He {{felt that the}} show was a cross between Fringe and Heroes with {{elements}} of The X-Files included. He {{thought that there was}} a potential for the series to be a success and thought that it would attract both Marvel fans and new viewers alike. Dave Bradley gave the episode four and a half out of five for SFX magazine, saying that the show was going to become a phenomenon alongside Doctor Who, The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones. He felt that using the Skye character to introduce the viewer to the series was cheesy, but effective. He praised J August Richards' performance but did not enjoy some of the characterizations of the main characters, which <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>think</b> the team was similar to that seen in Torchwood.|$|E
500|$|Tchaikovsky was {{inspired}} to reach beyond Russia with his music, according to Maes and Taruskin. His exposure to Western music, they write, encouraged him to think it belonged not just to Russia but to the world at large. Volkov adds that this mindset <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>think</b> seriously about Russia's place in European musical culture—the first Russian composer to do so. It steeled him {{to become the first}} Russian composer to personally acquaint foreign audiences with his own works, Warrack writes, {{as well as those of}} other Russian composers. In his biography of Tchaikovsky, Anthony Holden recalls the dearth of Russian classical music before Tchaikovsky's birth, then places the composer's achievements into historical perspective: [...] "Twenty years after Tchaikovsky's death, in 1913, Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring erupted onto the musical scene, signalling Russia's arrival into 20th-century music. Between these two very different worlds Tchaikovsky's music became the sole bridge." ...|$|E

500|$|Meat Loaf had {{announced}} that Michael Beinhorn was producing the record, but Desmond Child took the helm. The singer reports that Child would {{say things that}} <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>think</b> he {{was sitting next to}} Steinman. Child began recording sessions by playing Slipknot CDs to get the assembled musicians in the mood. In addition to musicians from his touring band, the Neverland Express, several guest players contributed to the album. Meat Loaf says, [...] "I didn't just want to bring in rock players — I wanted to go to extreme rock people" [...] resulting in an album that [...] "has all the touches of the other two Bats, but it's much more of a rock album." [...] Child says {{that one of the most}} memorable experiences working on the album was working with Brian May, who played on [...] "Bad for Good". The album also featured guest performances by John 5, Steve Vai and John Shanks.|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the song}} is set in common time and has a tempo of 120 beats per minute. While it is played in the key of C major and has backing piano and guitar sounds, [...] "Alfie" [...] also uses a sample from Sandie Shaw's 1967 Eurovision Song Contest winning song [...] "Puppet on a String". In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork Media, Allen stated that the song's lyrics describe her younger brother, Alfie Allen. She further explained:When I wrote [...] "Alfie", nobody really knew who I was. At first he was really upset about it, because he thought that I was just pointing out all of his bad points and attacking him. I thought it was really flattering [...] I thought he'd be really, really happy because it proved to him how much I loved him, that I care about him, and I {{want him to do}} something with his life. I suppose his paranoia — induced by smoking so much weed — <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>think,</b> [...] "Why are you trying to be mean?" ...|$|E
500|$|An early {{version of}} the film focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together, as {{it seemed to be}} the most humorous choice. By July 2012, the project was set for an {{evaluation}} screening with other Pixar filmmakers. Docter gradually began to feel that the story was not working, which <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>think</b> that he might get fired. He took a long walk one Sunday, where he began to consider himself a failure, and that he should resign from the film. While pondering what he would miss about Pixar, he concluded that he would miss his coworkers and friends most of all. He soon reached a breakthrough: that emotions are meant to connect people together, and that relationships are the most important things in life. He decided to replace Fear with Sadness, which he felt is crucial to renewal. He met with Rivera and Del Carmen that night to explain his change of plans, and to his surprise, they reacted positively to it. At the screening, he informed his superiors that new plans for the film were in order. Although it was a [...] "scary moment", the film remained in production.|$|E

500|$|Astral Weeks {{critical}} standing improved greatly over time. [...] It became {{viewed as}} one of rock's greatest records and a culturally significant work. A number of factors afforded the record its canonical reputation in rock criticism: its back story as a commercial underachiever and highly personal work for Morrison, its distinction {{from the rest of}} his discography, his artistic autonomy, the music's song cycle composition, the enigmatic lyrics, and the quality of seriousness and originality as perceived by mature rock audiences and writers. According to Rob Sheffield, it was Morrison's [...] "most beautiful and intense album", the foundation for his [...] "legend", and a work that continues to captivate musicians and listeners. Lester Bangs said its anguished feeling resonated with him on first listen, calling it [...] "the rock record with the most significance in my life so far ... a record about people stunned by life, completely overwhelmed, stalled in their skins, their ages and selves, paralyzed by the enormity of what in one moment of vision they can comprehend." [...] Irish musician Glen Hansard said it <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>think</b> about life with a greater depth of feeling, [...] "with a greater sense of fear and horror and desire than you ever imagined." [...] Colin Larkin credited Morrison for fully realizing his ambition to [...] "create without pop's constraints" [...] on Astral Weeks, while AllMusic's William Ruhlmann said its reputation among critics was justified because [...] "unlike any record before or since," [...] it [...] "encompasses the passion and tenderness that have always mixed in the best postwar popular music".|$|E

2500|$|Briggs's talents weren’t {{limited to}} cricket. He also played hockey for Manchester. Between 1878 and 1882 {{he played for}} Widnes Rugby Football Club, playing the {{important}} position of fullback (standing at 5ft 4 ins tall). Many people remarked on his sharp and athletic fielding in cricket and it was {{probably due to the}} skills and fitness that he gained during his stint with Widnes. In 1882 a broken arm <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>think</b> about retirement from rugby. He carried on playing for Widnes occasionally until 1884 after which time his cricket career blossomed.|$|E

2500|$|Game {{designer}} Will Wright {{was inspired}} to create a [...] "virtual doll house" [...] after losing his home during the Oakland firestorm of 1991 and subsequently rebuilding his life.

When he initially took his ideas to the Maxis board of the directors, they were skeptical and gave little support or financing for the game.

2500|$|Barks (2007) is, ostensibly, {{the story}} of Israel as seen {{through the eyes of}} its dogs, though it is more about its owners than the pets themselves. Loevy {{explained}} that the inspiration for the film was the dog Dooby that he grew up with as a child, and a scene he once witnessed in an affluent neighborhood in Tel Aviv. It was there that he first encountered a dog with an electric collar, which would deliver a shock every time the animal barked. Though this never appears in the film, the incident eventually <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>think</b> about how Israelis are usually so kind to their dogs, even though they can act so cruelly to others. [...] "The film is about Israeli society", he said, [...] "about our racism." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "River" [...] is an {{instrumental}} track, of which Nicky suggested its title {{as the music}} <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>think</b> of one when he heard it. He knew Enya had the final decision over song titles if she preferred another, but she liked his title and went with it. Nicky spoke about Enya's style of composing for song: [...] "There are five synths Midi'd but then she plays chords over these random arpeggiators with notes popping in and out where you don't expect them. Somehow she makes that work". [...] "The Longships" [...] makes reference to the longship war boats used by the Vikings, who first invaded Ireland in AD 795 and settled in Dublin by AD 841. [...] "Na Laetha Geal M'óige", translated from Gaelic as [...] "The Brighter Days of My Youth", is about the reminiscence of the days during Enya's childhood, and receives a dedication in Gaelic to her grandparents.|$|E
