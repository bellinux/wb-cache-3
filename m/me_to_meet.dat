500|$|After {{successfully}} rehabilitating {{his knee}} in the offseason, Rivera announced on March9, 2013, {{that he would}} retire after the 2013 season, his 19th in the major leagues. Throughout his final year, Rivera spent time during visits to each ballpark meeting privately with fans and unsung team employees to hear their stories and thank them for supporting baseball. He explained: [...] "It was important for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> {{the people who make}} baseball what it is, the people who work in the game every day. They have given me far more than I have given them." [...] Each opposing team returned the favor by honoring Rivera with a gift during his final visit to their city: in Cleveland, the Indians teamed up with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to present Rivera with a gold record of his entrance song [...] "Enter Sandman"; the Minnesota Twins commissioned a rocking chair made of broken bats, many broken personally by Rivera's cutter, called the [...] "Chair of Broken Dreams"; the rival Boston Red Sox gave him a painting and several artifacts from Fenway Park. Many teams made donations to the Mariano Rivera Foundation, the pitcher's charitable organization. Corporate sponsors of the Yankees paid tribute as well; Delta Air Lines dedicated a Boeing 757 airplane with Rivera's signature and uniform number 42 on the exterior, while Hard Rock Cafe retired [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] from its song system at all locations except for its Yankee Stadium restaurant.|$|E

In 2011, another Filipino artist, Gary Valenciano during his visit in Malaysia has expressed her admiration of Siti's vocal ability. He commented, [...] "Based on what I've been told by the local media, I believe the best Malay song and the best vocal I've ever heard has to be Siti Nurhaliza's. If {{it was possible for}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> her, I would definitely want to do a duet with her. If [...] were given a chance, I definitely want to compose a song for her, that is if she wishes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later in 1990, Alexandru Stefu (another {{old friend}} from Romania) invited Comăneci and Panait to Montreal, {{where he was}} staying {{with his family and}} Béla Károlyi. Comăneci noted in her memoir that after they arrived in Montreal, andwhen he finally had an {{opportunity}} to get me alone, Alexandru asked what was next for me. I told him that I was thinking about staying in Montreal, but hadn't yet mentioned the idea to [...] because he'd already booked us on a flight back to Los Angeles. The next day, Alexandru sent <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with the director of the Olympic stadium, who told me that I could do some exhibitions and appearances for him [...] When I woke up the next morning and went downstairs, Alexandru told me that [...] was gone. I never heard from him again, but I hope he is well and thank him for his help. I realize that our business relationship may have tarnished my name and image, but I safely escaped from Romania, and that is truly what was most important. There wasn't too much time to figure out why [...] had left because very soon after his departure, CNN contacted me.|$|E
