5|$|A pawn moves {{straight}} forward one square, if that square is vacant. If {{it has not}} yet <b>moved,</b> <b>a</b> pawn also has the option of moving two squares {{straight forward}}, provided both squares are vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards.|$|E
5|$|At 4/189 Loxton {{came in to}} join Harvey, who {{continued}} to attack the bowling, unperturbed by Miller's demise. Ken Cranston came on to bowl and Harvey square drove and then hooked to deep square leg for consecutive boundaries. Yardley then <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> man from fine leg to where the hook had gone; Harvey responded by glancing a ball to the fielder's former position, collecting three more runs. Australia thus went to lunch at 4/204, with Harvey on 70.|$|E
5|$|Born Marcus Henry Kellogg on March 31, 1831, in Brighton, Ontario, Canada, Kellogg was {{the third}} of ten children. Kellogg's family <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> number of times in his youth before they {{eventually}} settled in La Crosse, Wisconsin. While there Kellogg learned to operate a telegraph {{and went to work}} for both the Northwestern Telegraph Company and the Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Company.|$|E
25|$|Each <b>move</b> of <b>a</b> {{piece is}} {{indicated}} by the piece's uppercase letter, plus the coordinate of the destination square. For example, Be5 (<b>move</b> <b>a</b> bishop to e5), Nf3 (<b>move</b> <b>a</b> knight to f3). For pawn <b>moves,</b> <b>a</b> letter indicating pawn is not used, only the destination square is given. For example, c5 (<b>move</b> <b>a</b> pawn to c5).|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} kinds of <b>moves.</b> <b>A</b> player may turn <b>a</b> piece face-up, <b>move</b> <b>a</b> piece, or capture an enemy piece. In some game variants, {{multiple}} captures may be made in one turn.|$|R
50|$|On {{its first}} <b>move,</b> <b>a</b> pawn must advance two squares—unless the pawn's first <b>move</b> is <b>a</b> capture.|$|R
5|$|High winds {{brought down}} {{telegraph}} wires {{and left the}} city almost entirely cut off from communication with outside locations. At Coney Island, the storm completely destroyed many buildings, walkways, piers, and beach resorts. Brighton Beach was hit particularly hard. The raging seas swept inland, washing out tracks of the Marine Railway. Bathing houses were <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> great distance by the cyclone. Near the Sheepshead Bay, Emmons Avenue was heavily damaged. Further to the east, at Greenport, numerous yachts were wrecked and scattered. Corn crops on land were ruined and fruit trees lost their fruits.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the {{transport}} authorities of Oslo decided to close Nordberg and Frøen stations, {{on the grounds}} that these stations were too expensive to maintain. The platforms at Vestgrensa were <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> few metres to adjust to the metro trains. Seven years later, on 22 August 1999, Vestgrensa was closed and replaced with the newly opened Forskningsparken Station.|$|E
5|$|In a 1993 paper, David Wonnacott, Barry J. Kellett and David J. Stickland {{identified}} {{this system}} as a candidate to evolve into a Type Ia supernova or a cataclysmic variable. At a distance of 150light years, this makes it the nearest known candidate supernova progenitor to the Earth. However, {{in the time it}} will take for the system to evolve to a state where a supernova could occur, it will have <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> considerable distance from Earth but may yet pose a threat.|$|E

5|$|Loxton {{came in to}} join Harvey at 189/4, who {{continued}} attacking, unperturbed by Miller's departure. Cranston came on and Harvey square drove and then hooked to deep square leg for two consecutive boundaries. Yardley <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> man from fine leg to the location where the previous hook had gone; Harvey responded by glancing a ball to where the fine leg fielder had been, collecting three more runs. Australia thus went to lunch at 204/4, with Harvey on 70.|$|E
5|$|The Austrians briefly {{took the}} {{advantage}} when they <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> battery from the ridge {{north of the}} village to cover their infantry; the fire from the battery allowed the infantry to deploy {{at right angles to}} their original front. Frederick responded by ordering the last of his reserved left wing to advance, but the Austrian battery drove it back. Finally, Frederick's heavy cannons on the Butterberg, a small knoll to the west of town, laid down a barrage. Some participants said it was this barrage, more than the Prussian infantry, which won the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Mahdists {{immediately}} {{opened fire}} upon the Free State force, {{who remained in}} cover behind a rocky outcropping some ways from the Mahdist line. For half an hour the Mahdists continued to fire at Chaltin's companies to little effect, their shots passing harmlessly above the rocks. Meanwhile, Free State soldiers <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> Krupp gun into position which, under Sergeant Cajot, fired several shells into the Mahdists' ranks.|$|E
5000|$|A {{player can}} safely <b>move</b> <b>a</b> piece to a cell between two enemy pieces without being captured.

50|$|Unlike xiangqi, all pieces <b>move</b> identically: <b>a</b> piece may <b>move</b> {{only one}} square up, down, left, or right. A piece may never <b>move</b> onto <b>a</b> square {{that is already}} {{occupied}} unless such <b>a</b> <b>move</b> is <b>a</b> legal capture.|$|R

5|$|The routing of US223 {{was changed}} through Adrian in 1935, {{shifting}} the highway along different streets through town. Another change in 1942 through Adrian {{led to the}} creation of the first business loop through the city. This version of the business loop lasted until the main highway was <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> second time in 1956. With this subsequent move, the business loop designation was shifted to its current location.|$|E
5|$|A few {{accounts}} {{exist that}} describe females defending their newborn litters. Wharten (1960, 1966) reported several cases where females found near their young stood their ground and considered these to be examples of guarding behavior. Another case {{was described by}} Walters and Card (1996) in which a female was found {{at the entrance of}} a chamber with seven neonates crawling on or around her. When one of the young was <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> short distance from the chamber, she seemed to be agitated and faced the intruder. Eventually, all of her offspring retreated into the chamber, but the female remained at the entrance, ready to strike.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the millennium, the airline renewed its aging fleet, {{retiring}} several of its S-61 and 206 helicopters and replacing them with Bell 212s and Eurocopter AS350s. The company also sacked its CEO Peter Fich, who had proven unable to balance Greenland Home Rule's demands for local Greenlander service with the board's for expanded tourism, lower fares and higher profits. Under his replacement Finn Øelund, Grønlandsfly initially posted a DKK 30 million loss as contractual obligations maintained unprofitable service while a strike ruined the summer tourist season and Post Greenland <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> lucrative mail contract to the Danish-owned Air Alpha Greenland. In response, the company successfully pushed back against Greenland Home Rule's large demands, high fees and low subsidies and rebranded itself, anglicising its name to Air Greenland and adopting a new logo and livery on 18 April 2002.|$|E
50|$|The killer {{heuristic}} {{attempts to}} produce a cutoff by assuming that <b>a</b> <b>move</b> that produced <b>a</b> cutoff in another branch of the game tree at the same depth is likely {{to produce a}} cutoff in the present position, {{that is to say}} that <b>a</b> <b>move</b> that was <b>a</b> very good <b>move</b> from <b>a</b> different (but possibly similar) position might also be <b>a</b> good <b>move</b> in the present position. By trying the killer move before other <b>moves,</b> <b>a</b> game playing program can often produce an early cutoff, saving itself the effort of considering or even generating all legal <b>moves</b> from <b>a</b> position.|$|R

5|$|As {{originally}} assigned, NY132 {{bypassed the}} center of Yorktown Heights to the north. This was changed by 1932 as NY132 was realigned to directly serve the hamlet by way of Crompond and Saw Mill River roads. In the early 1940s, all of NY132 east of Yorktown became part of NY35, a new cross-county route extending from Peekskill to the Connecticut state line. As a result, NY132 was truncated to its junction with NY35 and US202 in the hamlet of Yorktown. NY132's northern terminus was <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> short distance northward between 1968 and 1973 {{as a result of}} the re-alignment of US6 through Yorktown. Prior to being called Old Yorktown Road, most of NY132 was named Crompond Street.|$|E
5|$|Ben Arfa {{was born}} into a family with a {{football}} history. His father was the former Tunisian international footballer Kamel Ben Arfa. Ben Arfa began his career in France at ASV Châtenay-Malabry. After two years at the club, he <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> few miles north to Montrouge CF 92. In 1998, Ben Arfa joined sporting club AC Boulogne-Billancourt. The following year, he was selected to attend the Clairefontaine academy. While at Clairefontaine, he was a part of A la Clairefontaine, a documentary series which chronicled the lives of some of France's top young footballers during their time at the academy. During the series, an episode showed Ben Arfa getting into an argument with Abou Diaby. While training at Clairefontaine during the weekdays, he played for FC Versailles on the weekends.|$|E
5|$|Contradicting these claims, {{the medieval}} Annales Suecici Medii Aevi and the 13th century legend of Saint Botvid mention some Henry as the Bishop of Uppsala (Henricus scilicet Upsalensis) in 1129, {{participating}} in the consecration of the saint's newly built church. He is apparently the same Bishop Henry who died at the Battle of Fotevik in 1134, fighting along with the Danes after being banished from Sweden. Known from the Chronicon Roskildense written soon after his death and from Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum from the early 13th century, he had fled to Denmark from Sigtuna, the see of the early Uppland bishops before it was <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> few kilometers to its later location in Uppsala sometime before 1164. He is ignored in all Swedish bishop chronicles, unless he is the same Henry who was later redated to the 1150s. That would make the claim about him coming to Finland with King Eric a late innovation, where memory about a killed bishop in Uppsala sometime in the 12th century was reused in a new context.|$|E
5000|$|To {{keep the}} game from ending in a draw due to copycat <b>moves,</b> there is <b>an</b> {{additional}} rule: no player may <b>move</b> <b>a</b> piece onto their opponent's home row if that <b>move</b> creates <b>a</b> pattern of left-to-right symmetry on the board.|$|R

50|$|The PP (power points) of <b>a</b> <b>move</b> {{indicate}} {{how many times}} a Pokémon may use that <b>move.</b> <b>As</b> with Accuracy, <b>a</b> powerful <b>move</b> is often offset by having a low amount of PP. Once a Pokémon uses up all the PP for <b>a</b> certain <b>move,</b> {{it can no longer}} use that <b>move.</b> If <b>a</b> Pokémon expends all the PP for all of its moves, it then resorts to <b>a</b> <b>move</b> called Struggle. However, in the first generation games, the game does not reduce the PP of Pokémon controlled by non-player trainers, enabling those trainers to use powerful <b>moves</b> <b>an</b> abnormal number of times.|$|R
5|$|In 1927, the Simon Commission {{which was}} {{appointed}} {{to report on the}} working of the progress of the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms landed in India. The Swarajya Party <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> resolution to boycott the Commission and this was passed 61 to 50 with 12 remaining neutral. The Justice Party and the Swarajists supported the resolution while the Chief Minister P. Subbarayan opposed it and requested his ministers to resign. However, Lord Goschen, the Governor, was able to obtain the support of the Raja of Panagal by making a Justice Party member, M. Krishnan Nair, a Cabinet minister. Led by the Raja of Panagal, the Justice Party switched sides and lent its support to the Subbarayan government. Soon afterwards, the Justice Party passed a resolution welcoming the Simon Commission. The Simon Commission visited Madras on 28 February 1928 and 18 February 1929 and was boycotted by the Swarajya Party and the Indian National Congress. However, the Justicites and the Subbarayan Government accorded the Commission a warm reception.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Pierce {{was honored}} at the Little Rock Film Festival, where festival {{producers}} screened a retrospective of his films, and {{presented him with}} a Lifetime Achievement Award. Also that year, the festival's best film award was renamed in his honor to the Charles B. Pierce Award for Best Film Made in Arkansas, In October 2009, the Arkansas Arts Council honored Pierce with the Judges' Special Recognition Award at the Governor's Arts Awards ceremony in Hot Springs. Pierce {{died of natural causes}} on March 5, 2010 at the Signature Care nursing home in Dover, Tennessee, where he had <b>moved</b> <b>a</b> few years earlier. He was 71. Pierce directed thirteen films over the span of 26 years. He was considered one of the first modern independent filmmakers, and was credited with breaking new ground for other independent filmmakers, particularly for the Arkansas film industry.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the individual military punishments, the army took further internal measures to {{lower the risk of}} another insurrection. According to Maurice Rives, 10,000 Vietnamese troops were given transfers to different zones. This meant that more than 80% of Tonkin's approximately 12,000 Tirailleurs Tonkinois were <b>moved,</b> <b>a</b> transfer of enormous proportions, indicating the extent of insecurity among French commanders towards Vietnamese troops, {{and the extent to which}} they were willing to go to make future Yen Bays impossible. One possible rationale for this measure was to break up any undiscovered VNQDĐ cells and to sever personal ties, within units and between soldiers and civilians in their local district. The mass transfer of soldiers also had the effect of creating a state of constant mobilisation, denying troops the time and opportunity for anti-colonial organisation.|$|E
