40|$|In this study, porous titanium- 10 wt. % {{bioglass}} nanocomposites were fabricated by {{the combination}} of mechanical alloying and a space holder sintering process. <b>The</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>powders</b> were <b>mechanically</b> alloyed for 15 h. The blended Ti-Bioglass was mixed with 30 wt. % carbamide as a space holder. The mixtures were uniaxially pressed and finally, the green compacts sintered at 1150 oC for 5 hours. The porous structures are characterized by X-ray diffraction method (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The mechanical properties were examined using micro hardness and compression tests. The investigation revealed that after 15 h of milling, the Bioglass dissolved in Ti lattice. Also, results show that nanostructured Ti- 10 wt. % Bioglass with 31. 5 nm crystallite size possess greater hardness compared to respective microcrystalline titanium and desirable compressive strength for using in biomedical application...|$|R

40|$|A {{phase change}} from {{alpha-alumina}} (corundum) in <b>the</b> feedstock <b>powder</b> to predominantly other alumina phases, such as gamma-alumina in the coating normally takes place, {{as a result}} of the spray process. It is expected that the prevention of this phase transformation will significantly improve the mechanical, electrical, and other properties of thermally sprayed alumina coatings. The results regarding the possibility of stabilization of a-alumina through addition of chromia published in the literature are ambiguous. In this work, stabilization using different spray processes (water-stabilized plasma (WSP), gas-stabilized plasma (APS), and high-velocity oxy-fuel spray (HVOF)) was studied. Mechanical mixtures of alumina and chromia were used, as were prealloyed powders consisting of solid solutions. The investigations focused on mechanical mixtures with both APS and WSP and on prealloyed <b>powders</b> with WSP. <b>The</b> coatings were studied by x-ray diffraction, including Rietveld analysis, and analysis of the lattice parameters. Microstructures were investigated by optical microscopy using metallographic cross-sections. It was shown that in the case of <b>the</b> <b>mechanically</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>powders,</b> <b>the</b> stabilization predominantly depends on the applied spray process. The stabilization of the a phase by use of the WSP process starting from mechanical mixtures was confirmed. It appears that stabilization exhibits a complex dependence on the spray process, the process parameters (in particular the thermal history), the nature of <b>the</b> <b>powder</b> (<b>mechanically</b> <b>mixed</b> or prealloyed), and the chromia content...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Alumina is {{utilized}} {{in many areas}} of modern industry because of its unique mechanical, electrical and optical properties. Various methods are been employed for produce alumina for different end uses. The preparation of fine and sintering-reactive alumina powders {{is probably one of the}} most important steps for production alumina ceramics with controlled microstructure. In this work, it was studied the production of alumina powders by “Pechini ” method associated to high-energy milling. For this, it was prepared the resin by Pechini method, using aluminum nitrate nona-hydrate. This resin was calcined at 500 oC. Then, <b>the</b> calcined <b>powders</b> were submitted a high energy milling for different times. <b>The</b> <b>powders</b> <b>mechanically</b> activated were characterized by x ray diffraction, FT-IR and scanning electronic microscopic.
