5|$|Pteranodon was {{notable for}} its skull crest, though the {{function}} of this crest has been a subject of debate. Most explanations {{have focused on the}} blade-like, backward pointed crest of male P. longiceps, however, and ignored the wide range of variation across age and sex. The fact that the crests vary so much rules out <b>most</b> <b>practical</b> functions other than for use in mating displays. Therefore, display was probably the main function of the crest, and any other functions were secondary.|$|E

APXS was also used in the Surveyor 5–7 moon probes but with a 242Cm source.|$|E

5|$|According to Callisthenes, the Persians {{were using}} water clocks in 328 {{to ensure a}} just and exact {{distribution}} of water from qanats to their shareholders for agricultural irrigation. The use of water clocks in Iran, especially in Zeebad, dates back to 500. Later they were also {{used to determine the}} exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions, such as the Nowruz, Chelah, or Yaldā – the shortest, longest, and equal-length days and nights of the years. The water clocks used in Iran were one of the <b>most</b> <b>practical</b> ancient tools for timing the yearly calendar.|$|E

5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also {{tends to be more}} difficult, because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in one sense they are simpler: the use of a separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are <b>most</b> <b>practical</b> in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|E
5|$|In this context, Castelli and Álzaga plotted to oust Liniers and {{constitute}} a local government Junta, {{similar to those}} of the metropoli. This project was not shared by most of the natives or by the head of the Regiment of Patricians, Cornelio Saavedra. Manuel Belgrano proposed as an alternative to support the plans of Princess Charlotte, which were supported by Castelli and other criollos. Belgrano, who held monarchist ideas, argued that the Carlotist project would be the <b>most</b> <b>practical</b> means of achieving independence from Spain in the circumstances. On September 20, 1808, Castelli wrote a letter to Charlotte, with the signatures of Antonio Beruti, Hipólito Vieytes, Belgrano, and Nicolás Rodríguez Peña.|$|E
5|$|The party's ski boots, {{specially}} designed by Amundsen, were {{the product of}} two years' testing and modification in search of perfection. The party's polar clothing included suits of sealskin from Northern Greenland, and clothes fashioned after {{the style of the}} Netsilik Inuit from reindeer skins, wolf skin, Burberry cloth and gabardine. The sledges were constructed from Norwegian ash with steel-shod runners made from American hickory. Skis, also fashioned from hickory, were extra long to reduce the likelihood of slipping into crevasses. The tents—"the strongest and <b>most</b> <b>practical</b> that have ever been used"—had built-in floors and required a single pole. For cooking on the march, Amundsen chose the Swedish Primus stove rather than the special cooker devised by Nansen, because he felt the latter took up too much space.|$|E

5|$|Shooting {{by trained}} marksmen is {{considered}} to be the <b>most</b> <b>practical</b> method of control due to its effectiveness. The NSW Department of Primary Industries believe shooting is the preferred method of population control as it does not subject the horses to the stresses of mustering, yarding, and long-distance transportation, all of which are related to 'capture and removal' methods. Horses that are only initially wounded from shooting are tracked and dispatched if they are in accessible, open country. However, shooting of horses in mountain ranges is not regarded as a humane means of control. Helicopter shootings allow for aerial reconnaissance of a large area to target the densest populations, and shooters may get close enough to the target animals to ensure termination. This method is considered the most effective and cost efficient means of control, but disapproval is high amongst those that believe it is inhumane. Organizations supporting Brumbies argue that aerial shooting is unnecessary and that alternative population control methods have not been given adequate trials, while government officials express concern about the need to control rapidly growing populations in order to avoid ecological problems associated with too many feral horses in certain areas.|$|E
5|$|Within his Remarks, Staszic did not {{portray the}} life of Jan Zamoyski (1542–1605, {{one of the most}} {{prominent}} statesmen in Polish history); rather, he argued that reforms are needed, and that Zamoyski had already proposed or supported many of them two centuries before. Staszic was a strong partisan of reforms and an ardent advocate for the interests of the lower classes. He advocated the abolition of the serfdom and improvements of the peasants' fate (by granting them land and private rights). He criticised the szlachta (Polish nobility) for inefficient governance, and argued that it showed itself too inept to be allowed to govern alone. He argued for a slight increase in taxes, which should allow the Commonwealth to create an army of 100,000 that would at least stand a chance against the still-larger armies of its neighbours. Although he preferred republicanism in theory, in the Commonwealth context he agreed that a strengthening of the central (royal) power was the <b>most</b> <b>practical</b> solution for reforming the country, in line with the similar developments elsewhere in Europe. In Remarks he even supported the introduction of an absolute monarchy in Poland.|$|E
