40|$|This study {{attempts}} to analyze comparatively marital satisfaction {{and quality of}} life in <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> exceptional children and <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> normal children. Methodology in present study is comparative. For sample, it selects 40 <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> normal children in nursery school and preschool located in Ahvaz, 40 <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> exceptional children under education and care in daily sanatorium, and 30 <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> exceptional children hospitalized (nightly) in Ahvaz. They are tested by a enrich questionnaire of short form with 47 questions and 36 questions of quality of life. Statistical model of one-way variance analysis is used for data analysis. Findings indicate that there is no significant difference in marital satisfaction between <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> exceptional children in caring centers and <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> normal children, yet there is a significant difference in quality of life (mental-physical) between <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> exceptional children and <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> normal children. Results of study indicate that mental quality of life as dependent variable is influenced by factors such as children with mental or physical disability as independent variables. Birth of an exceptional child reduces mental quality of life. Results show that not presence of exceptional child for full-time is highly effective on physical quality of life. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Hypothyroidism and gestational {{diabetes}} {{are common}} endocrine disorders in pregnancy. Our {{aim is to}} evaluate the outcome of newborns from <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> hypothyroidism and from <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> gestational diabetes. Patients and methods. The study analysed 216 newborns: 112 from <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> gestational diabetes and 104 from <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> hypothyroidism. For each case, we included as a control a newborn of same sex and gestational age from a mother without diabetes or thyreopathy. Results. In newborns from <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> gestational diabetes there was an increased frequency of hypoglycaemia and hypocalcaemia, of lower head circumference and of small-for-gestational age (SGA) birth or macrosomy (LGA) than controls. The newborns from <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> hypothyroidism are more frequently SGA or LGA {{and they have a}} slightly increased risk of hypoglycaemia. Conclusions. Newborns from <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> diabetes mellitus or hypothyroidism have an increased risk of being SGA or LGA, and to develop a mild transient hypoglycaemia. Newborns from <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> diabetes mellitus have also an increased risk to develop hypocalcacmia and to have a lower head circumference than controls.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{association}} between perinatal losses and mother’s long-term mortality and modification by surviving children and attained education. Design: A population-based cohort study. Setting: Norwegian national registries. Participants: We followed 652 320 <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> a first delivery from 1967 and completed reproduction before 2003, until 2010 or death. We excluded <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> plural pregnancies, without information on education (0. 3 %) and women born outside Norway. Main outcome measures: Main outcome measures were age-specific (40 – 69 years) cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality. We calculated mortality in <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> perinatal losses, compared <b>with</b> <b>mothers</b> without, and in <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> one loss by number of surviving children in strata of mothers’ attained education (< 11 years (low), ≥ 11 years (high)). Results: <b>Mothers</b> <b>with</b> perinatal losses had increased crude mortality compared <b>with</b> <b>mothers</b> without; total: HR 1. 3 (95 % CI 1. 3 to 1. 4), cardiovascular: HR 1. 8 (1. 5 to 2. 1), non-cardiovascular: HR 1. 3 (1. 2 to 1. 4). Childless <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> one perinatal loss had increased mortality compared <b>with</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> one child and no loss; cardiovascular: low education HR 2. 7 (1. 7 to 4. 3), high education HR 0. 91 (0. 13 to 6. 5); non-cardiovascular: low education HR 1. 6 (1. 3 to 2. 2), high education HR 1. 8 (1. 1 to 2. 9). <b>Mothers</b> <b>with</b> one perinatal loss, surviving children and high education had no increased mortality, whereas corresponding <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> low education had increased mortality; cardiovascular: two surviving children HR 1. 7 (1. 2 to 2. 4), three or more surviving children HR 1. 6 (1. 1 to 2. 4); non-cardiovascular: one surviving child HR 1. 2 (1. 0 to 1. 5), two surviving children HR 1. 2 (1. 1 to 1. 4).

The second purpose was to identify the relationship of the following demographic variables to childrearing attitudes: mother's age, mother's marital status, family income, sex of child, age of child, access to child, generational status, mother's language and mother's ethnicity. The PAAT and the Parent Information Questionnaire were administered to 112 Mexican-American mothers; 54 Mexican- American <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> ten years of education or fewer and 58 Mexican-American <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> eleven years of education or more. The population from which these subjects were drawn were mothers from Mexican-American communities in a North Texas county. Responses on the sample were analyzed using multivariate statistics. Based on the analysis of the data, the following conclusions seem tenable. 1. The Mexican-American <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> eleven years of education or more have childrearing attitudes which are more positive than the Mexican-American <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> ten years of education or fewer. 2. Control and teaching-learning are related to the mother's educational level, income, generational status and language. The <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> more education and a higher income, who are third generation and who prefer English usage, tend to allow their children more independence. 3.

Study selection and analysis Studies had to include <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> {{a diagnosis of}} BPD, who was the primary caregiver to a child/children under 19 years. PsycINFO and MEDLINE were screened (update: July 2014), yielding 17 relevant studies. Findings <b>Mothers</b> <b>with</b> BPD are often parenting {{in the context of}} significant additional risk factors, such as depression, substance use and low support. Interactions between <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> BPD and their infants are at risk of low sensitivity and high intrusiveness, and mothers have difficulty in correctly identifying their emotional state. Levels of parenting stress are high, and self-reported competence and satisfaction are low. The family environment is often hostile and low in cohesion, and <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> BPD show low levels of mind-mindedness but high levels of overprotection of older children. Outcomes for children are poor compared with both children of healthy <b>mothers,</b> and <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> other disorders. Infants of <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> BPD have poorer interactions <b>with</b> their <b>mother</b> (eg, less positive affect and vocalising, more dazed looks and looks away). Older children exhibit a range of cognitive–behavioural risk factors (eg, harm avoidance, dysfunctional attitudes and attributions), and have poorer relationships <b>with</b> their <b>mothers.</b> Unsurprisingly, given these findings, children of <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> BPD have poorer mental health in a range of domains.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Historically, {{many women}} with {{intellectual}} disability (ID) {{did not have}} children. However, {{a few decades ago}} it became more common for women with ID to give birth. Our aim was to compare the completed pregnancies of <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> ID with other completed pregnancies in a large, defined population. METHODS: We used the archived dataset of the Oxford record linkage study from 1970 to 1989, which included a specialized dataset of all maternities in a population of 850 [*] 000 people. RESULTS: There were 245 [*] 007 births, of which 217 were to <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> a record of ID. <b>Mothers</b> <b>with</b> a record of ID were more likely than others to give birth at a young age, {{were much more likely to}} be unmarried (42 % compared with 9 %) and to have smoked in the pregnancy (54 % compared with 23 %). Comparing babies born of <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> ID and others, percentages with very low birth weight (< 2000 [*]g) were similar at 1. 9 and 1. 8 %. There was no excess of babies who were low birth weight for gestational age. Babies born of <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> ID were much less likely than others to be breastfed (respectively, 33 and 70 %). There were no significant associations with presentation at delivery, Caesarean section or forceps delivery. The distribution of Apgar scores at 1 [*]min after birth was similar in babies of <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> ID and other babies. The sex ratio of the babies was normal. Combining stillbirths and infant deaths, rates per 1000 were 27. 9 for babies of <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> ID and 13. 4 in other babies (borderline significant at P[*]=[*] 0. 07). CONCLUSIONS: Comparing pregnancies and outcomes of <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> and without ID, there are some important differences, and some important similarities. It is possible, however, that there may be differences over time and between different places in the care and outcomes of pregnancies in <b>mothers</b> <b>with</b> ID.
