40|$|The {{growth of}} {{securitization}} {{made it easier}} for banks to sell home mortgage loans that they originated. I explore how <b>mortgage</b> <b>sales</b> affected banks in the years leading up to the financial crisis that began in 2007 and how their pre-crisis <b>mortgage</b> <b>sales</b> affected banks during the crisis. Loan sales are important because most banks sell mortgages as part of the securitization process, but few actually do the securitization. I find that stock returns increase when banks increase <b>sales</b> of <b>mortgages</b> used for refinancing rather than home purchase, suggesting that some banks scale up lending during refi booms. It is this flexibility that is both a plus and a potential minus of this model, since banks profited by scaling up during refi booms, but borrowers during refi booms were riskier than at other times, possibly adding risk to the financial system. I also find that losses during the financial crisis were related to pre-crisis <b>mortgage</b> <b>sales,</b> with the losses being roughly of the same magnitudes as the gains due to <b>mortgage</b> <b>sales</b> from 2001 - 2006.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a collection}} of three essays in financial economics, specifically focused on the role of information and beliefs in credit markets. The first chapter establishes that private bank information about customers in primary lending markets exists. The second chapter shows that private information hinders banks' capacities to sell loans on secondary markets, unless the purchaser believes that the bank has committed to remain uninformed. The third chapter explores the welfare consequences of incorrect borrower beliefs about the economic environment on financial product choice. In the first chapter, my co-author and I hypothesize that while lending to a firm, a bank receives signals that allow it to learn and better understand the firm's fundamentals; and that this learning is private; that is, it is information that is not fully reflected in publicly-observable variables. We test this hypothesis using data from the syndicated loan market between 1987 and 2003. We construct a variable that proxies for firm quality and is unobservable by the bank, so it cannot be priced when the firm enters our sample. We show that the loading on this factor in the pricing equation increases with relationship time, hinting that banks are able to learn about firm quality when they are in an established relationship with the firm. In the second chapter, I present new evidence that lemon problems hinder trade on secondary mortgage markets. Using the geographic distance from lenders to borrowers as a proxy for the absence of private bank information, I document a systematic positive link between distance and the <b>mortgage</b> <b>sale</b> rate. <b>Mortgage</b> <b>sale</b> rates are higher when the originating lender is less likely to be informed about the borrower. I further show that the private <b>mortgage</b> <b>sale</b> rate locally depends on lender-borrower distance only above the conforming loan limit, in the illiquid jumbo market where the GSEs are barred from purchasing mortgages. This is consistent with the familiar tradeoff between market liquidity and seller incentives to acquire information. In the third chapter, I investigate how borrowers' incorrect beliefs about future inflation might bias their choice between fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages. Borrowers who have experienced recent periods of greater inflation pay more for fixed-rate mortgage contracts and pay more in interest, at least over the first six yeras of the mortgage's life. That is, incorrect beliefs about future inflation are welfare-reducing both ex ante and ex post...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} notion of 'misselling' {{in the context of}} {{financial}} services. 'Misselling' is treated as a special case of error in the classification of a discrete dependent variable. A simulation study is conducted using the <b>sale</b> of <b>mortgage</b> debt to outright owners of property {{as an example of how}} inappropriate sales manifest themselves. This is followed by the actual case of endowment <b>mortgage</b> <b>sales.</b> The results and discussion suggests that 'misselling' can be viewed (i) in the context of empirical regularities and a rationalizable view of the data and|or (ii) as a non rationalizable situation where the 'misselling' becomes 'pathological'. The paper highlights the need for a behavioural perspective, in addition to a more conventional economic treatment of the 'misselling' phenomenon. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

40|$|Most condominiums in China {{are sold}} forward on a pre-sale market, where purchasers and {{developers}} transact on an underlying property {{that is not}} yet completed. During the pre-sale period home buyers face a significant forward contract risk. However, home buyers can borrow mortgages from banks {{so that they can}} effectively share the forward contract risk with banks. This explains the phenomenon of irregularly high early-stage default and prepayment rates observed in residential mortgage lending in China, where there are few, if any, financial incentives for mortgage borrowers to exercise either put or call options. Mortgages collateralized by forward housing assets are riskier than are those with underlying assets traded on the spot market. However, currently Chinese mortgage banks charge the same rate to all mortgage borrowers. This inefficiency in risk sharing between mortgage borrowers’ groups in the forward and spot housing markets leads to mispricing in secondary <b>mortgage</b> <b>sales</b> and mortgage-backed security trading...|$|R

50|$|A fideicommissary has {{prior to}} the vesting {{of his or her}} {{interest}} only a contingent right to the property (sometimes referred to as a mere spes or expectation of benefit). If, however, any attempt is made by the fiduciary or by any third persons to infringe the rights of the fideicommissary the court will give the latter ample and effective protection. Thus the court will interdict a threatened alienation of the fideicommissary property, and it will refuse to grant execution against the property in respect of a judgment obtained against the fiduciary. Similarly the court will generally not allow the fiduciary to mortgage the property, for the fideicommissary is not liable for the debts of the fiduciary; but as pointed out earlier, there are circumstances in which the court may consent to the <b>mortgage</b> or <b>sale</b> of the fideicommissary property.
