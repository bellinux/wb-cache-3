Candide's remaining sheep are stolen, and Candide is fined heavily by a Dutch magistrate for petulance over the theft. Before leaving Suriname, Candide feels in need of companionship, so he interviews a number of local <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> through various ill-fortunes and settles on a man named Martin.|$|E
5|$|The hunt of {{the pilot}} whale is known by the locals as the Grindadráp. There are no fixed hunting seasons. As soon as a pod close enough to land is spotted, the locals set out to begin the hunt, after {{approval}} from the sysselman. The animals are driven into a bay which is approved for whaling by the Faroese government, and then {{they try to make}} the whales to beach themselves. The only way out is being blocked off by some of the boats, which stay there until <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> waiting on shore have slaughtered all the whales.|$|E

25|$|Transgender <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> oophorectomized must {{continue}} androgen therapy to avoid premature osteoporosis. Estrogen supplementation is theoretically not usually necessary, {{as some of}} the injected testosterone will be aromatized into estrogen sufficient to maintain bone (as it does in cisgender men). However, a single small study of trans men after oophorectomy demonstrated that androgens alone may be insufficient to retard bone loss. (van Kesteren P, et al. “Long-term follow-up of bone mineral density and bone metabolism in transsexuals treated with cross-sex hormones.” Clin Endocrin. 48(3):347-54. 1998.) It is likely the case that pre-oophorectomy, residual estrogen production is protective. However, after oophorectomy, some trans men may have insufficient estrogen to retard bone loss.|$|E

Salim and Nate destroy Marlowe's convey and rescue Sully. Nate and Sully lose Salim in a sand storm. In Ubar, Nate drinks from a water fountain. Talbot appears with Marlowe and shoots Sully, killing him. Furious, Nate gives chase and encounters more of Marlowe's <b>men,</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> possessed by the Djinn. He experiences vivid hallucinations and comes round, realizing he hallucinated Sully's death. Nate realizes that King Solomon cast the vessel containing hallucinogenic minerals into the well beneath Ubar, tainting the water and causing Nate to hallucinate; te vessel is what Queen Elizabeth sent Francis Drake to find, but after learning the consequences of his quest, Drake abandoned his mission.|$|E

500|$|In its {{organizational}} structure {{the church is}} similar to congregationalism, as the local assembly is autonomous. This form of congregationalism, however, is unique; the centralized organization gives to the Church of Besançon the role of head church, and the other assemblies of the federation are considered annex churches. Thus, Amiotte-Suchet opines that [...] "the unifying spirit is much more coercive {{than the one in}} other Protestant groups". Decisions of the federation are made by all church pastors at monthly pastoral meetings. In the Church of Besançon, the leadership team attending the [...] "brothers' meeting" [...] is composed of René and Étienne Kennel, six appointed elders and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> members for a certain length of time.|$|E

These revenants are called by the name of oupires or vampires, that is to say, leeches; and such particulars are related of them, so singular, so detailed, and invested with such probable circumstances and such judicial information, that one can hardly refuse to credit the belief which is held in those countries, that these revenants come out of their tombs and produce those effects which are proclaimed of them.|$|E
500|$|Also in 1988, Gaven {{played the}} part of the Russian chess player's wife Svetlana in the {{short-lived}} Broadway production of the musical Chess, for which she was praised by critics. The following year she appeared as Carol Bates in the Broadway musical Welcome to the Club. It revolves around four <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> put in jail for not paying alimony. The musical shows why they ended up divorcing their wives, one of which is played by Gaven. Both Chess and Welcome to the Club were unsuccessful. John Simon criticized the latter musical in a New York Magazine review but praised Gaven's performance, writing: [...] "The cast ranges from the charmless to the hopeless [...] in this mess. Only Marcia Mitzman manages to stand out from the crowd, and when she gets the right part in the right show, she'll do just fine." [...] Associated Press drama critic Michael Kuchwara also wrote negatively about Welcome to the Club while giving praise to Gaven for projecting [...] "a sympathy [...] that isn't apparent in the book." ...|$|E

Patton approached Bennett, who was huddled and shivering, and asked what the trouble was. [...] "It's my nerves," [...] Bennett responded. [...] "I can't stand the shelling anymore." [...] Patton reportedly became enraged at him, slapping him across the face. He began yelling: [...] "Your nerves, hell, you are just a goddamned coward. Shut up that goddamned crying. I won't have these brave <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> shot at seeing this yellow bastard sitting here crying." [...] Patton then reportedly slapped Bennett again, knocking his helmet liner off, and ordered the receiving officer, Major Charles B. Etter, not to admit him. Patton then threatened Bennett, [...] "You're {{going back to the}} front lines and you may get shot and killed, but you're going to fight. If you don't, I'll stand you up against a wall and have a firing squad kill you on purpose. In fact, I ought to shoot you myself, you goddamned whimpering coward." [...] Upon saying this, Patton pulled out his pistol threateningly, prompting the hospital's commander, Colonel Donald E. Currier, to physically separate the two. Patton left the tent, yelling to medical officers to send Bennett back to the front lines.|$|E
500|$|Gaga also {{utilized}} the 3D game Minecraft {{in a sequence}} and enlisted Minecraft Youtuber SkyDoesMineCraft in a sequence which depicts the singer reviving famous <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> dead. The artist had {{been a fan of}} the game since Martyn Littlewood of The Yogscast used it to create a parody of her 2011 single, [...] "Born This Way", which she appreciated. Minecraft and Lego were also used to create little items like fruits and chairs in the video. The 3D theme also expanded onto using artist Nathan Sawaya's Lego sculpture Yellow—which showed a man ripping his chest out—in a sequence showing Gaga's head being transposed on the artpiece. Sawaya recalled that Gaga had contacted him for collaborating on the music video. They mutually agreed on the idea of making art [...] "accessible" [...] and decided on the different sculptures to be created, including a duplicate of Yellow, without the head. Sawaya then traveled to Hearst Castle to install the art pieces for the shoot. Multiple designer dresses were also used in the video namely, a white ensemble with a giant headpiece by Jean Paul Gaultier, jeans by Versace, a red swimsuit by La Perla and a black one by Madrid label POL, jewelry from Lynn Ban, and custom made sandals form Ruthie Davis. The homicide scenes showed designs by Helen Yarmak, lace bodysuits by Somarta and Aturo Rios feathered headpiece. Designer Bea Szenfeld created a dress from paper resembling a teddy bear as well as other couture also. Finally, gold colored latex body suit created by Atsuko Kudo was also work by Gaga, as well as gold garments for her backup dancers.|$|E
