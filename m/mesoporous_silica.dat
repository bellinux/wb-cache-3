25|$|The {{most common}} type of optical glass is crown glass, which has an index of {{refraction}} of about 1.52. An optimal single-layer coating would have to be made of a material with an index of about 1.23. Unfortunately, there are no solid materials with such a low refractive index. The closest materials with good physical properties for a coating are magnesium fluoride, MgF2 (with an index of 1.38), and fluoropolymers (which can have indices as low as 1.30, but are more difficult to apply). MgF2 on a crown glass surface gives a reflectance of about 1%, compared to 4% for bare glass. MgF2 coatings perform much better on higher-index glasses, especially those with index of refraction close to 1.9. MgF2 coatings are commonly used because they are cheap, and when they are designed for a wavelength {{in the middle of the}} visible band, they give reasonably good anti-reflection over the entire band. Researchers have produced films of <b>mesoporous</b> <b>silica</b> nanoparticles with refractive indices as low as 1.12, which function as antireflection coatings.|$|E

Recent advances in nanotechnology have allowed the design of materials with nanostructure similar to that of natural bone.

Organic poly(furfuryl alcohol) (PFA) was incorporated into silica walls by co-polymerization of furfuryl alcohol (FA) and silica source such as tetraethyl orthosilicate during the triblock copolymer P 123 templating process. <b>Mesoporous</b> <b>silicas</b> with wormhole pore structure were obtained by completely burning off organic polymers P 123 and PFA from the silica-P 123 -PFA nanocomposites, and their pore size and pore volume were increased by simply adding a certian amount of FA.

When the large amount of FA (2. 12 FA: 1 SiO 2 by mole) was used in the synthesis, the pore size was expanded from 3. 4 nm to 7. 4 nm, and the pore volume was increased from 0. 46 cm 3 /g to 1. 37 cm 3 /g. At the same time, the pore size distribution was broadened. The BET surface area of the mesporous silicas was measured to be 632 - 728 m 2 /g.
