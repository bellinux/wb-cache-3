5|$|The 2008–09 season saw Napoli {{qualify for}} the UEFA Cup via the Intertoto Cup. However, the team was {{eliminated}} {{in the first round}} by Benfica. At the domestic level, Napoli <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> impressive start, proposing as one of the main candidates for a Champions League spot. However, results and performances quickly declined in mid-season, causing Napoli to fall down to 11th place in the league table, which led to the dismissal of manager Edoardo Reja in March 2009; former Italy national team manager Roberto Donadoni appointed as his replacement.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{had hoped}} {{to pursue a career}} in the British Army, but his mother vetoed an active {{military}} career. He had been gazetted colonel on 9 November 1858—to his disappointment, as he had wanted to earn his commission by examination. In September 1861, Edward was sent to Germany, supposedly to watch military manoeuvres, but actually in order to engineer a meeting between him and Princess Alexandra of Denmark, the eldest daughter of Prince Christian of Denmark and his wife Louise. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert had already decided that Edward and Alexandra should marry. They met at Speyer on 24 September under the auspices of his elder sister, Victoria, who had married the Crown Prince of Prussia in 1858. Edward's elder sister, acting upon instructions from their mother, had met Princess Alexandra at Strelitz in June; the young Danish princess <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> favourable impression. Edward and Alexandra were friendly from the start; the meeting went well for both sides, and marriage plans advanced.|$|E
5|$|Hrabri was {{launched}} in 1927 as the first submarine of the navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which later became the Royal Yugoslav Navy. Along with Nebojša, she left the Tyne in late January 1928. In company with the Yugoslav submarine tender , the two submarines arrived in the Bay of Kotor on the southern Adriatic coast on 8 April 1928. In May and June 1929, Hrabri, Nebojša, Hvar and six torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser Dalmacija on a cruise to Malta, the Greek island of Corfu in the Ionian Sea, and Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia. According to the British naval attaché, the ships and crews <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good impression while visiting Malta.|$|E

5|$|The {{inauguration of}} the first Whig {{president}} would give that party the opportunity to fill federal jobs for the first time. This proved complicated, and Harrison was called to Washington in mid-January, nearly two months before his March 4, 1841 inaugural date, to be at hand. He <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> public progress from Ohio to Washington, getting little rest along the way: even those Whigs who were not seeking government employment wanted to see and meet the President-elect and celebrations often surrounded his hotel all night. He reached Washington on February 9, his 68th birthday. After consultation with Whig politicians, he filled his cabinet, to the disappointment of some, like Henry Clay, who saw his nominees passed over, and Thaddeus Stevens, who believed he had been promised the position of Postmaster General.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Dmowski, {{increasingly}} {{convinced of}} Russia's impending defeat, decided that {{to support the}} cause of Polish independence he should go abroad to campaign on behalf of Poland in the capitals of the western Allies. During his lobbying efforts, his friends included such opinion makers as the British journalist Wickham Steed. In particular, Dmowski was very successful in France, where he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> favorable impression on public opinion. He gave a series of lecture at Cambridge University, which impressed the local faculty enough that {{he was given a}} honorary doctorate. In August 1917, in Paris, he created a new Polish National Committee aimed at rebuilding a Polish state. That year he also published, at his own expense, Problems of Central and Eastern Europe, that he soon distributed among numerous English speaking diplomats. He was a vocal critic of Austro-Hungary, and campaigned {{for the creation of a}} number of Slavic states (including for the Czechs, Hungarians and Romanians) in its place. Within the Polish political community, he opposed those who supported allying themselves with Germany and Austria-Hungary, including supporters of a vague German proposal for a Regency Kingdom of Poland, with undefined borders, that Germany promised to create after World War I (while in secret, actually planning to strip it of up to 30,000 square kilometers for German colonization after the removal of its Polish population).|$|E

25|$|The bowlers <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{good start}} in the Sri Lankan reply, with Sidebottom {{removing}} Tharanga and then the prize wicket of Kumar Sangakkara very cheaply. The score was 22/2 at this point. Stuart Broad had shared the new ball with Sidebottom and bowled impressively, although he did receive two warnings for running on the danger area of the pitch.|$|E

25|$|What {{followed}} was a Schieringer insurrection against the Hollanders, which <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> complex situation even more opaque. From this point on, everyone fought almost everyone, and the Hollanders {{seemed to have}} fared the worst: they were driven out in numerous places. The Hollandic fortress at Lemmer was captured on 18 January 1422 by Frisians from Doniawerstal and Schoterland, its commander, Floris of Alkemade, was taken prisoner, then executed.|$|E
25|$|The Irish have <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{significant}} contribution to education in Australia. Approximately 20% of Australian school students are currently enrolled in Roman Catholic schools that were, in large part, established by Irish Catholic religious orders. Large numbers of Irish priests, nuns and brothers followed other Irish immigrants to Australia from the earliest years of European settlement to provide education {{to the children of}} those immigrants.|$|E

25|$|During the 1970s, Sutherland {{strove to}} improve her diction, which had often been criticised, and {{increase}} the expressiveness of her interpretations. She continued to add dramatic bel canto roles to her repertoire, such as Donizetti's Maria Stuarda and Lucrezia Borgia, as well as Massenet's extremely difficult Esclarmonde, a role that few sopranos attempt. With Pavarotti she <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> successful studio-recording of Turandot in 1972 under the baton of Zubin Mehta, though she never performed the role on stage.|$|E
25|$|Cheating {{allegations}} {{were made at}} {{the first round of}} the 1994 season, the Brazilian Grand Prix. On lap21 of the race, Senna in the Williams who was leading the race, made a pit stop, with Michael Schumacher in the Benetton close behind. The Benetton pitcrew <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> quick stop for Schumacher, getting him out in front of Senna to lead the race. Schumacher went on to win the Grand Prix after Senna spun out of the race. This sparked speculation that Benetton were using a system to make quicker pit stops than their rivals.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Huang on 1 October 1716, Fourmont became officially {{responsible}} for classifying papers of the deceased. He <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> negative report on the contents of these documents and continued to criticize the work of Huang. Continuing {{his work on the}} languages of Europe and Asia (and therefore the Chinese), he took all the credit for the dissemination of the 214 key system in France, and finally published a French-Chinese lexicon and a Chinese grammar, without acknowledging the work of Huang, whom he was continuing to denigrate publicly.|$|E

25|$|After two average {{seasons for}} Leicestershire, Stevens was {{released}} by his home county {{at the end of}} the 2004 season, along with Damian Brandy and George Walker. He then joined Kent for the 2005 season. He <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good start to his Kent career, scoring over 1,000 runs in a season for the first time in his career. 2006 proved to be disappointing by comparison, yet he still averaged 39. His performances in the Pro40 League, however, brought Kent to the verge of promotion.|$|E
25|$|Alongside all this, England were bowled out for 281, {{and took}} a useful 93 run lead into the second innings. However, the {{strength}} of this position quickly evaporated as Sri Lanka <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good start to their second innings, with the openers (Sanath Jayasuriya and Michael Vandort) putting on 113. During this opening stand, Jayasuriya became only the second batsman to score six fours off a six-ball over in Test cricket (with James Anderson being the unfortunate bowler). After the day's proceedings, he announced his retirement from Test cricket.|$|E
25|$|The Midland Railway had {{invested}} heavily in new harbour facilities at Heysham and was anxious that its influence in Ulster would not end at Donegall Quay in Belfast. To extend its activity in Ireland it decided to purchase an interest in a large Irish railway. The BNCR was an efficient, prosperous company and well suited the Midland's purposes; it connected the two largest cities {{in the north of}} Ireland and had direct links to County Donegal. The Midland <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> tempting offer which the BNCR's directors advised the shareholders to accept. This was also agreed by the Midland's shareholders.|$|E
