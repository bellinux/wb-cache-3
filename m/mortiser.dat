5000|$|Several {{companies}} in Austria, Italy, France and Belgium manufacture what is commonly known in North America as a Euro(pean) combination machine, which typically contains a sliding-table saw with a scoring blade, a shaper, a thicknesser, a jointer, and a <b>mortiser.</b> These machines generally have 3 motors, {{one for the}} table saw, one for the shaper, and one shared by the thickness planer/jointer and <b>mortiser.</b>|$|E
50|$|The square chisel <b>mortiser</b> (also called {{hollow chisel}} <b>mortiser),</b> {{similar to a}} drill press in many respects, {{combines}} the cutting of a four-sided chisel with the action of a drill bit in the center. The bit clears {{out most of the}} material to be removed, and the chisel ensures the edges are straight and clean. This device was invented in 1874 by Robert and Ralph Greenlee (founders of the Greenlee Company).|$|E
50|$|A {{more recent}} {{innovation}} is the horizontal <b>mortiser,</b> which incorporates a router mounted statically {{on its side}} with the workpiece clamped to a multi-axis sliding table. This type of <b>mortiser</b> can produce either traditional mortise and tenon pairs, however it excels at floating (or 'loose') tenons. A floating tenon is where both the pieces of wood {{that are to be}} joined have aligned mortises cut into them and a separate piece of wood is milled into a fitted tenon which is glued into the two mortises.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} form of wood shaper has a {{vertical}} spindle; some have horizontal; others yet have spindles or tables that tilt. Some European models variously combine sliding tablesaws, jointers, planers, and <b>mortisers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Whether for {{hand-held}} chainsaws, mechanical timber harvesters or chain <b>mortisers,</b> the {{saw chain}} has undergone dramatic development since its invention. Modern chains designed for high power, high-speed sawing applications will vastly outperform older designs, while allowing {{a far greater}} degree of safety and reliability in use.|$|R
50|$|Chain <b>mortisers,</b> used {{to cut the}} mortice {{of large}} mortice and tenon timber framing use a number of chains, riveted side-by-side. They are used with a {{vertical}} tip-first plunge. Owing {{to the difficulty of}} resharpening the multiple teeth, these are usually made of long-lasting tungsten carbide.|$|R
50|$|A <b>mortiser</b> or morticer is a {{specialized}} woodworking machine used to cut square or rectangular holes {{in a piece}} of lumber (timber), such as a mortise in a mortise and tenon joint.|$|E
5000|$|Mafell AG (Maschinenfabrik Fellbach AktienGesellschaft) is a {{manufacturer}} of high-end woodworking power tools specialized for carpentry, founded in 1899. They are {{the inventor of the}} first portable electric carpentry power tool, a chain <b>mortiser</b> invented in 1926. [...] The company is located in Oberndorf am Neckar, Germany.|$|E
50|$|Square dog holes may {{be created}} using a <b>mortiser</b> or {{by using a}} chisel {{in the same way}} that a mortise is created. However the most common way to make these holes is to cut a series of dadoes in the edge of one of the boards that will make up the benchtop. When the boards are {{laminated}} together to form the benchtop, the dadoes form the square holes that are required.|$|E
50|$|The Greenlee Company still {{manufactures}} <b>mortisers,</b> as do a {{large number}} of other power tool manufacturers. It is a common tool in the woodshop of professional woodworkers, but because of its specialized nature, many amateur woodworkers would not make enough use of it to justify the moderately high cost and space this tool takes up in the woodshop. Some smaller and less expensive models, suitable for cutting only narrow mortises are available.|$|R
5000|$|For cutting small mortises, {{a normal}} drill bit can be used. However, for larger mortises, a {{common type of}} bit in modern <b>mortisers</b> is a Harry Watt square drill bit, in which a bit with a Reuleaux {{triangle}} cross section is allowed to [...] "wobble" [...] while it rotates within a square with rounded corners. This type of bit removes all but {{the corners of the}} material to be removed, leaving very little to be cut by the chisel.|$|R
50|$|For cutting larger mortises such {{as those}} used in timber frame construction, chain mortisers are {{commonly}} used. A chain with cutters (similar to a chainsaw chain) rotating within a frame clamped to the work is successively plunged into the workpiece to mortise out the required volume. The Makita 7104L is such a tool. These chains are made in varying widths, with numbers of chains in parallel. The teeth are often solid or tipped tungsten carbide. They are thus very expensive, sometimes {{as much as the}} rest of the <b>mortiser.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{technology}} that growing rapidly increasing custom product demand. On the other hand, support the technology mostly has limitations in operation. This {{resulted in an}} inability to accommodate overall the technology needs and {{the impact on the}} delay of the manufacturing process. In the production process Industrial Engineering Design Practice 1 at the Industrial Engineering Department, Muhammadiyah University of Surakarta, where one production machine that <b>Mortiser</b> machine can not be used optimally because {{of the size of the}} workpiece to be processed is not ideal for existing clamping system. This prompted the researchers to make modifications to the clamping system. Modifications made by considering the dimensions of the workpiece to be processed, the process is done by machines <b>Mortiser,</b> the technical aspects of designing production tools, as well as the availability of tools and material support. Tools designed clamping expected to overcome problems <b>Mortiser</b> machining process on the machine, allowing the machine operator to run the machining process, and increase efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The study {{identified}} {{practical skills}} possessed by woodwork graduates of Niger state technical colleges in using woodworking machines, hand tools and consumables. Three research questions were answered and two hypotheses tested at 0. 05 level of significance. A survey research design was adopted for the study. A structured questionnaire {{was used to}} gather data from one hundred and two respondents. Simple random sampling was applied to identify the study sample. Mean rating was used to answer research questions, t- test statistics {{was used to test}} the hypotheses. Cronbach Alpa Formula was used to determine reliability coefficient of the instrument. The reliability coefficient of the instrument was found to 0. 81. The findings of the study showed that Woodwork graduates of technical colleges in Niger State used all the woodworking machines listed except band saw machine, tenoning machine, <b>mortiser</b> and thicknesser. They used all the hand tools such as hammer, screw driver, hand plane, electric jig saw, scraper, pincer, plier, try square and spanner. It was recommended that State Government should provide modern machines for improving practical skills of woodwork students and Woodwork teachers should teach students how to apply formica on wood surfaces...|$|E
