Despite the many simplifications, Boolean tools still capture the gross behaviour of the system even in the absence of kinetic constants determined experimentally. On this basis, we argue that still with a limited volume of data binary formalisms allow us to penetrate the raison d'être of extant regulatory and <b>metabolic</b> <b>architecture...</b>|$|E

40|$|Organisms must {{carefully}} {{control their}} metabolism {{in order to}} survive. On the other hand, enzymes must adapt in response to evolutionary pressures on the pathways {{in which they are}} imbedded. Taking advantage of the newly available whole-genome sequences of 12 Drosophila species, we examined how protein function and <b>metabolic</b> network <b>architecture</b> influence rates of enzyme evolution. We found that despite high overall constraint, there were significant differences in rates of amino acid substitution among functional classes of enzymes. This heterogeneity arises because proteins involved in the metabolism of foreign compounds evolve relatively rapidly, whereas enzymes that act in “core” metabolism exhibit much slower rates of amino acid replacement, suggesting strong selective constraint. Network architecture also influences enzymes’ rates of amino acid replacement. In particular, enzymes that share metabolites with many other enzymes are relatively constrained, although apparently not because {{they are more likely to}} be essential. Our analyses suggest that this pattern is driven by strong constraint of enzymes acting at branch points in metabolic pathways.

40|$|A {{central and}} long-standing issue in {{evolutionary}} theory is {{the origin of}} the biological variation upon which natural selection acts 1. Some hypotheses suggest that evolutionary change represents an adaptation to the surrounding environment within the constraints of an organism's innate characteristics. Elucidation of the origin and evolutionary relationship of species has been complemented by nucleotide sequence and gene content analyses, with profound implications for recognizing life's major domains. Understanding of evolutionary relationships may be further expanded by comparing systemic higher-level organization among species. Here we employ multivariate analyses to evaluate the biochemical reaction pathways characterizing 43 species. Comparison of the information transfer pathways of Archaea and Eukaryotes indicates a close relationship between these domains. In addition, whereas eukaryotic metabolic enzymes are primarily of bacterial origin, the pathway-level organization of archaeal and eukaryotic metabolic networks is more closely related. Our analyses therefore suggest that during the symbiotic evolution of eukaryotes, incorporation of bacterial metabolic enzymes into the proto-archaeal proteome was constrained by the host's pre-existing <b>metabolic</b> <b>architecture.</b> Comment: More info at [URL]...|$|E

40|$|To {{explore the}} effects of PD {{pathology}} on brain connectivity, we characterized with an emergent computational approach the brain metabolic connectome using [18 F]FDG-PET in early idiopathic PD patients. We applied whole-brain and pathology-based connectivity analyses, using sparse-inverse covariance estimation in thirty-four cognitively normal PD cases and thirty-four age-matched healthy subjects for comparisons. Further, we assessed high-order resting state networks by interregional correlation analysis. Whole-brain analysis revealed altered metabolic connectivity in PD, with local decreases in frontolateral cortex and cerebellum and increases in the basal ganglia. Widespread long-distance decreases were present within the frontolateral cortex as opposed to connectivity increases in posterior cortical regions, all suggestive of a global-scale connectivity reconfiguration. The pathology-based analyses revealed significant connectivity impairment in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway and in the regions early affected by α-synuclein pathology. Notably, significant connectivity changes were present in several resting state networks especially in frontal regions. These findings expand previous imaging evidence of altered connectivity in cognitively stable PD patients by showing pathology-based connectivity changes and disease-specific <b>metabolic</b> <b>architecture</b> reconfiguration at multiple scale levels, from the earliest PD phases.

30|$|Although autocatalytic {{networks}} {{are found in}} biological systems, the systematic impact of including the metal and cofactor protein dependencies as catalysts in metabolic networks under the RAF context has not been previously investigated. The present analyses shows that, within this framework, the E. coli metabolic network can indeed be expressed as an RAF set. RAFs also recover the modularity and hierarchical behavior of the E. coli metabolic network – in particular they underscore the crucial role of cofactors as the prime mediators of metabolism, a recurring theme {{in the study of}} <b>metabolic</b> <b>architecture</b> [11, 55, 58]. Here we have shown the important role of metals and molecules such as NAD, ATP and CoA in breaking autocatalytic cycles and sustaining the network complexity. This result is in agreement with findings of Heinrich and coworkers [59], who analysed the scopes of compounds and expansion within KEGG metabolic networks and showed the crucial role of the inclusion of these metabolites in the expansion and robustness increase of metabolic networks. Moreover, by also including the metal and cofactor dependencies of the proteins, we extended this set of compounds by identifying additional molecules such as thiamin and PLP as autocatalytic metabolites within E. coli metabolism. Thus, RAFs can clearly be used to explore the biological importance of molecules/catalyst within a cell and their interrelationships. But there are caveats.|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} presents {{results obtained}} from a model based design of metabolic networks. In {{the first part of}} the paper, topological analysis is used for exploring the <b>metabolic</b> <b>architecture.</b> These investigations—also called pathway analysis or flux space analysis—are aimed at detecting the metabolic routes that lead from anyone starting point to some products. The technique is applied for the computation of maximal yields for amino acids and, for the first time, also for the analysis of metabolic networks in context with the formation of biomass. The latter study leads to an array of mutants with different biomass yields, for which the name “Phenome ” has been coined. In the second part of the contribution, a strategy for the optimization of product formation rates is presented by means of the ethanol formation rate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A dynamic model based on experimental observations at defined anaerobic conditions serves as a starting point. Non-linear optimization of the distribution of enzyme activities results in a substantial increase of ethanol formation rate. The optimum is mainly constrained by homeostasis and can be characterized by higher activities of strongly rate limiting steps. However, some enzymes exerting almost no control on ethanol flux (e. g. triose phosphate isomerase) are found at higher activities as well. This finding can be explained by the enzyme’s ability of counteracting an increase of pool concentrations effectively...|$|E
40|$|For decades, {{experimental}} work has {{laid the foundation}} for our understanding of the linear and branched pathways that are integrated to form the metabolic networks on which life is built. Genetic and biochemical approaches applied in model organisms generate empirical data that correlate genes, gene products and their biological activities.

At large, genome annotation and metabolic network reconstructions have demystified genomic content of non-culturable microorganisms and allowed researchers to explore the breadth of metabolisms in silico. Mis-annotation aside, it is unclear whether in silico reconstructions of metabolic structure from component parts accurately captures the higher levels of network organization and flux distribution. For this approach to provide accurate predictions, one must assume that the conservation of metabolic components leads to conservation of <b>metabolic</b> network <b>architecture</b> and function.

Data are typically collected at a single point in time. Biological processes on the other hand are often non-linear and display time varying dynamics. The extent to which graphical models can recapitulate the architecture of an underlying biological processes is not well understood. We consider metabolic networks with known stoichiometry to address the fundamental question: "What can causal networks tell us about metabolic pathways?". Using data from an Arabidopsis Bay[Formula: see text]Sha population and simulated data from dynamic models of pathway motifs, we assess our ability to reconstruct metabolic pathways using graphical models. Our results highlight the necessity of non-genetic residual biological variation for reliable inference. Recovery of the ordering within a pathway is possible, but should not be expected. Causal inference is sensitive to subtle patterns in the correlation structure that may be driven by a variety of factors, which may not emphasize the substrate-product relationship. We illustrate the effects of <b>metabolic</b> pathway <b>architecture,</b> epistasis and stochastic variation on correlation structure and graphical model-derived networks.

40|$|Comparative {{metabolic}} modelling {{is emerging}} as a novel field, supported {{by the development of}} reliable and standardized approaches for constructing genome-scale metabolic models in high throughput. New software solutions are needed to allow efficient comparative analysis of multiple models in the context of multiple cellular objectives. Here, we present the user-friendly software framework Multi-Metabolic Evaluator (MultiMetEval), built upon SurreyFBA, which allows the user to compose collections of metabolic models that together can be subjected to flux balance analysis. Additionally, MultiMetEval implements functionalities for multi-objective analysis by calculating the Pareto front between two cellular objectives. Using a previously generated dataset of 38 actinobacterial genome-scale metabolic models, we show how these approaches can lead to exciting novel insights. Firstly, after incorporating several pathways for the biosynthesis of natural products into each of these models, comparative flux balance analysis predicted that species like Streptomyces that harbour the highest diversity of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters in their genomes do not necessarily have the metabolic network topology most suitable for compound overproduction. Secondly, multi-objective analysis of biomass production and natural product biosynthesis in these actinobacteria shows that the well-studied occurrence of discrete metabolic switches during the change of cellular objectives is inherent to their <b>metabolic</b> network <b>architecture.</b> Comparative and multi-objective modelling can lead to insights that could not be obtained by normal flux balance analyses.

Forty-two percent of the SNPs in 65 % of the genes show statistically significant clines in frequency with latitude across the 20 local population samples collected from southern Florida to Ontario. A number of SNPs in the screened genes are also associated with significant expression variation within the Raleigh population from North Carolina. A principal component analysis of the full variance– covariance matrix of latitudinal changes in SNP-associated standardized gene expression allows us to identify those major genes in the pathway and its associated branches that are likely targets of natural selection. When embedded in a central metabolic context, we show that these apparent targets are concentrated in the genes of the upper glycolytic pathway and pentose shunt, those controlling glycerol shuttle activity, and finally those enzymes associated with the utilization of glutamate and pyruvate. These metabolites possess high connectivity and thus may be the points where flux balance can be best shifted. We also propose that these points are conserved points associated with coupling energy homeostasis and energy sensing in mammals. We speculate that the modulation of gene expression at specific points in central metabolism {{that are associated with}} shifting flux balance or possibly energy-state sensing plays a role in adap-tation to climatic variation.

40|$|The phenylpropanoid pathway {{gives rise}} to {{metabolites}} that determine floral colour and fragrance. These metabolites {{are one of the}} main means used by plants to attract pollinators, thereby ensuring plant survival. A lack of knowledge about factors regulating scent production has prevented the successful enhancement of volatile phenylpropanoid production in flowers. In this study, the Production of Anthocyanin Pigment 1 (Pap 1) Myb transcription factor from Arabidopsis thaliana, known to regulate the production of non-volatile phenylpropanoids, including anthocyanins, was stably introduced into Petunia hybrida. In addition to an increase in pigmentation, Pap 1 -transgenic petunia flowers demonstrated an increase of up to tenfold in the production of volatile phenylpropanoid/benzenoid compounds. The dramatic increase in volatile production corresponded to the native nocturnal rhythms of volatile production in petunia. The application of phenylalanine to Pap 1 -transgenic flowers led to an increase in the otherwise negligible levels of volatiles emitted during the day to nocturnal levels. On the basis of gene expression profiling and the levels of pathway intermediates, it is proposed that both increased metabolic flux and transcriptional activation of scent and colour genes underlie the enhancement of petunia flower colour and scent production by Pap 1. The co-ordinated regulation of metabolic steps within or between pathways involved in vital plant functions, as shown here for two showy traits determining plant–pollinator interactions, provides a clear advantage for plant survival. The use of a regulatory factor that activates scent production creates a new biotechnological strategy for the <b>metabolic</b> <b>architecture</b> of fragrance, leading to the creation of novel genetic variability for breeding purposes...|$|E
40|$|Metabolism {{displays}} {{striking and}} robust regularities in {{the forms of}} modularity and hierarchy, whose composition may be compactly described. This renders <b>metabolic</b> <b>architecture</b> comprehensible as a system, and suggests {{the order in which}} layers of that system emerged. Metabolism also serves as the foundation in other hierarchies, at least up to cellular integration including bioenergetics and molecular replication, and trophic ecology. The recapitulation of patterns first seen in metabolism, in these higher levels, suggests metabolism as a source of causation or constraint on many forms of organization in the biosphere. We identify as modules widely reused subsets of chemicals, reactions, or functions, each with a conserved internal structure. At the small molecule substrate level, module boundaries are generally associated with the most complex reaction mechanisms and the most conserved enzymes. Cofactors form a structurally and functionally distinctive control layer over the small-molecule substrate. Complex cofactors are often used at module boundaries of the substrate level, while simpler ones participate in widely used reactions. Cofactor functions thus act as "keys" that incorporate classes of organic reactions within biochemistry. The same modules that organize the compositional diversity of metabolism are argued to have governed long-term evolution. Early evolution of core metabolism, especially carbon-fixation, appears to have required few innovations among a small number of conserved modules, to produce adaptations to simple biogeochemical changes of environment. We demonstrate these features of metabolism at several levels of hierarchy, beginning with the small-molecule substrate and network architecture, continuing with cofactors and key conserved reactions, and culminating in the aggregation of multiple diverse physical and biochemical processes in cells.

Here we present experimental results obtained with yeast that support a novel hypothesis {{on the existence}} of two molecular pathways that lead to the generation of lamellar and tubular cristae. Formation of lamellar cristae depends on the mitochondrial fusion machinery through a pathway that is required also for homeostasis of mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA. Tubular cristae are formed via invaginations of the inner boundary membrane by a pathway independent of the fusion machinery. Dimerization of the F 1 FO-ATP synthase and the presence of the MICOS complex are necessary for both pathways.

At shorter timescales, a cell is able to adapt to fluctuations in the environment by means of regulating gene expression. By modelling gene regulatory interactions in a graph-theoretic framework and using a constraints-based approach to measuring cell growth or by using dynamic graphical models and suitable learning algorithms, several studies have investigated the short-term behaviour of cell evolution. However, the modelling the long-term evolution of genetic information and the resulting metabolic behaviour (or <b>metabolic</b> network <b>architecture)</b> of a cell has received less attention. Here we propose a model of coupled regulatory-metabolic network evolution and discuss the theoretical and computational aspects of the model. By representing gene regulatory relationships as Boolean functions and applying constraints-based methods of assessing the robustness of an evolutionary event in the genome, the model attempts to predict the long-term metabolic behaviour of a cell.

However, this vast amount of information needs to be extracted in a reasonable way and funneled into manageable and functionally meaningful patterns. Genes may be reasonably combined using knowledge about their interaction behaviour. On a proteomic level, biochemical research has elucidated an increasingly complete image of the <b>metabolic</b> <b>architecture,</b> especially for less complex organisms like the well studied bacterium Escherichia coli. Results We sought to discover central components of the metabolic network, regulated by the expression of associated genes under changing conditions. We mapped gene expression data from E. coli under aerobic and anaerobic conditions onto the enzymatic reaction nodes of its metabolic network. An adjacency matrix of the metabolites was created from this graph. A consecutive ones clustering method was used to obtain network clusters in the matrix. The wavelet method was applied on the adjacency matrices of these clusters to collect features for the classifier. With a feature extraction method the most discriminating features were selected. We yielded network sub-graphs from these top ranking features representing formate fermentation, in good agreement with the anaerobic response of hetero-fermentative bacteria. Furthermore, we found a switch in {{the starting point for}} NAD biosynthesis, and an adaptation of the l-aspartate metabolism, in accordance with its higher abundance under anaerobic conditions. Conclusion We developed and tested a novel method, based on a combination of rationally chosen machine learning methods, to analyse gene expression data on the basis of interaction data, using a metabolic network of enzymes. As a case study, we applied our method to E. coli under oxygen deprived conditions and extracted physiologically relevant patterns that represent an adaptation of the cells to changing environmental conditions. In general, our concept may be transferred to network analyses on biological interaction data, when data for two comparable states of the associated nodes are made available. </p...|$|E
40|$|Terrestrial mud volcanoes (MVs) are an {{important}} natural source of methane emission. The role of microbial processes in methane cycling and organic transformation in such environments remains largely unexplored. In this study, we aim to uncover functional potentials and community assemblages across geochemical transitions in a ferruginous, sulfate-depleted MV of eastern Taiwan. Geochemical profiles combined with 16 S rRNA gene abundances indicated that anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) mediated by ANME- 2 a group coincided with iron/manganese reduction by Desulfuromonadales at shallow depths deprived of sulfate. The activity of AOM was stimulated either by methane alone or by methane {{and a range of}} electron acceptors, such as sulfate, ferrihydrite, and artificial humic acid. Metagenomic analyses revealed that functional genes for AOM and metal reduction were more abundant at shallow intervals. In particular, genes encoding pili expression and electron transport through multi-heme cytochromes were prevalent, suggesting potential intercellular interactions for electron transport involved in AOM. For comparison, genes responsible for methanogenesis and degradation of chitin and plant-derived molecules were more abundant at depth. The gene distribution combined with the enhanced proportions of 16 S rRNA genes related to methanogens and heterotrophs, and geochemical characteristics suggest that particulate organic matter was degraded into various organic entities that could further fuel in situ methanogenesis. Finally, genes responsible for aerobic methane oxidation were more abundant in the bubbling pool and near-surface sediments. These methane oxidizers account for the ultimate attenuation of methane discharge into the atmosphere. Overall, our results demonstrated that various community members were compartmentalized into stratified niches along geochemical gradients. These community members form a metabolic network that cascades the carbon transformation from the upstream degradation of recalcitrant organic carbon with fermentative production of labile organic entities and methane to downstream methane oxidation and metal reduction near the surface.

40|$|To {{incorporate}} bioremedial functions {{into the}} performance of buildings and to balance generative architecture's dominant focus on computational programming and digital fabrication, this thesis first hybridizes theories of autopoiesis into extended cognition in order to research biological domains that include synthetic biology and biocomputation. Under the rubric of living technology I survey multidisciplinary fields to gather perspective for student design of bioremedial and/or metabolic components in generative architecture where generative not only denotes the use of computation but also includes biochemical, biomechanical, and metabolic functions. I trace computation and digital simulations back to Alan Turing's early 1950 s Morphogenetic drawings, reaction-diffusion algorithms, and pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) {{in order to establish}} generative architecture's point of origin. I ask provocatively: Can buildings think? as a question echoing Turing's own "Can machines think?" Thereafter, I anticipate not only future bioperformative materials but also theories capable of underpinning strains of metabolic intelligences made possible via AI, synthetic biology, and living technology. I do not imply that metabolic architectural intelligence will be like human cognition. I suggest, rather, that new research and pedagogies involving the intelligence of bacteria, plants, synthetic biology, and algorithms define approaches that generative architecture should take in order to source new forms of autonomous life that will be deployable as corrective environmental interfaces. I call the research protocol autopoietic-extended design, theorizing it as an operating system (OS), a research methodology, and an app schematic for design studios and distance learning that makes use of in-field, e-, and m-learning technologies. A quest of this complexity requires scaffolding for coordinating theory-driven teaching with practice-oriented learning. Accordingly, I fuse Maturana and Varela's biological autopoiesis and its definitions of minimal biological life with Andy Clark's hypothesis of extended cognition and its cognition-to-environment linkages. I articulate a generative design strategy and student research method explained via architectural history interpreted from Louis Sullivan's 1924 pedagogical drawing system, Le Corbusier's Modernist pronouncements, and Greg Lynn's Animate Form. Thus, autopoietic-extended design organizes thinking about the generation of ideas for design prior to computational production and fabrication, necessitating a fresh relationship between nature/science/technology and design cognition. To systematize such a program requires the avoidance of simple binaries (mind/body, mind/nature) as well as the stationing of tool making, technology, and architecture within the ream of nature. Hence, I argue, in relation to extended phenotypes, plant-neurobiology, and recent genetic research: Consequently, autopoietic-extended design advances design protocols grounded in morphology, anatomy, cognition, biology, and technology in order to appropriate metabolic and intelligent properties for sensory/response duty in buildings. At m-learning levels smartphones, social media, and design apps source data from nature for students to mediate on-site research by extending 3 D pedagogical reach into new university design programs. I intend the creation of a dialectical investigation of animal/human architecture and computational history augmented by theory relevant to current algorithmic design and fablab production.

In this study, we investigated the susceptibility of C. neoformans cells in biofilm and planktonic states to oxidative and nonoxidative antimicrobial molecules produced by phagocytic cells. The effects of various immune effector molecules on the fungal mass, <b>metabolic</b> activity, and <b>architecture</b> of C. neoformans biofilms were measured by colony counts, 2, 3 -bis(2 -methoxy- 4 -nitro- 5 -sulfophenyl) - 5 -[(phe-nylamino) carbonyl]- 2 H-tetrazolium hydroxide reduction, and confocal microscopy, respectively. Biofilms were more resistant than planktonic cells to oxidative stress but remained vulnerable to cationic antimicrobial peptides. However, melanized biofilms were significantly less susceptible to antimicrobial peptides than nonmelanized biofilms. These results suggest that the biofilm phenotype increases resistance against host immune mechanisms, a phenomenon that could contribute to the ability of biofilm-forming microbes to establish persistent infections.

40|$|Abstract Background Low-yield {{metabolism}} is a puzzling {{phenomenon in}} many unicellular and multicellular organisms. In abundance of glucose, many cells use a highly wasteful fermentation pathway despite {{the availability of}} a high-yield pathway, producing many ATP molecules per glucose, e. g., oxidative phosphorylation. Some of these organisms, including the lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis, downregulate their high-yield pathway in favor of the low-yield pathway. Other organisms, including Escherichia coli do not reduce the flux through the high-yield pathway, employing the low-yield pathway in parallel with a fully active high-yield pathway. For what reasons do some species use the high-yield and low-yield pathways concurrently and what makes others downregulate the high-yield pathway? A classic rationale for metabolic fermentation is overflow metabolism. Because the throughput of metabolic pathways is limited, influx of glucose exceeding the pathway's throughput capacity is thought to be redirected into an alternative, low-yield pathway. This overflow metabolism rationale suggests that cells would only use fermentation once the high-yield pathway runs at maximum rate, but it cannot explain why cells would decrease the flux through the high-yield pathway. Results Using flux balance analysis with molecular crowding (FBAwMC), a recent extension to flux balance analysis (FBA) that assumes that the total flux through the metabolic network is limited, we investigate the differences between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and L. lactis that downregulate the high-yield pathway at increasing glucose concentrations, and E. coli, which keeps the high-yield pathway functioning at maximal rate. FBAwMC correctly predicts the metabolic switching mode in these three organisms, suggesting that <b>metabolic</b> network <b>architecture</b> is responsible for differences in metabolic switching mode. Based on our analysis, we expect gradual, "overflow-like" switching behavior in organisms that have an additional energy-yielding pathway that does not consume NADH (e. g., acetate production in E. coli). Flux decrease through the high-yield pathway is expected in organisms in which the high-yield and low-yield pathways compete for NADH. In support of this analysis, a simplified model of metabolic switching suggests that the extra energy generated during acetate production produces an additional optimal growth mode that smoothens the metabolic switch in E. coli. Conclusions Maintaining redox balance is key to explaining why some microbes decrease the flux through the high-yield pathway, while other microbes use "overflow-like" low-yield metabolism. </p...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{features}} of a genetic network’s response to environmental fluctuations represent essential functional specifications and thus may constrain the possible choices of network architecture and kinetic parameters. To explore the connection between dynamics and network design, we have analyzed a general regulatory architecture that is commonly found in many <b>metabolic</b> pathways. Such <b>architecture</b> {{is characterized by a}} dual control mechanism, with end product feedback inhibition and transcriptional regulation mediated by an intermediate metabolite. As a case study, we measured with high temporal resolution the induction profiles of the enzymes in the leucine biosynthetic pathway in response to leucine depletion, using an automated system for monitoring protein expression levels in single cells. All the genes in the pathway are known to be coregulated by the same transcription factors, but we observed drastically different dynamic responses for enzymes upstream and immediately downstream of the key control point—the intermediate metabolite a-isopropylmalate (aIPM), which couples metabolic activity to transcriptional regulation. Analysis based on genetic perturbations suggests that the observed dynamics are due to differential regulation by the leucine branch-specific transcription factor Leu 3, and that the downstream enzymes are strictly controlled and highly expressed only when aIPM is available. These observations allow us to build a simplified mathematical model that accounts for the observed dynamics and can correctly predict the pathway’s response to new perturbations. Our model also suggests that transient dynamics and steady state can be separately tuned and that th...|$|R
40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is a {{degenerative}} {{joint disease}} affecting cartilage {{and is the}} most common form of arthritis worldwide. One third of OA patients have severe synovitis and less than 10 % have no evidence of synovitis. Moreover, synovitis is predictive for more severe disease progression. This offers a target for therapy but more research on the pathophysiological processes in the synovial tissue of these patients is needed. Functional studies performed with synovial tissue will be more approachable when this material, that becomes available by joint replacement surgery, can be stored for later use. We set out to determine the consequences of slow-freezing of human OA synovial tissue. Therefore, we validated a method that can be applied in every routine laboratory and performed a comparative study of five cryoprotective agent (CPA) solutions. To determine possible deleterious cryopreservation-thaw effects on viability, the synovial tissue <b>architecture,</b> <b>metabolic</b> activity, RNA quality, expression of cryopreservation associated stress genes, and expression of OA characteristic disease genes was studied. Furthermore, the biological activity of the cryopreserved tissue was determined by measuring cytokine secretion induced by the TLR ligands lipopolysaccharides and Pam 3 Cys. Compared to non frozen synovium, no difference in cell and tissue morphology could be identified in the conditions using the CS 10, standard and CryoSFM CPA solution for cryopreservation. However, we observed significantly lower preservation of tissue morphology with the Biofreeze and CS 2 media. The other viability assays showed trends in the same direction but were not sensitive enough to detect significant differences between conditions. In all assays tested a clearly lower viability was detected in the condition in which synovium was frozen without CPA solution. This detailed analysis showed that OA synovial tissue explants can be cryopreserved while maintaining the morphology, viability and phenotypical response after thawing, offering enhanced opportunities for human in vitro studies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUnderstanding clonal {{strategies}} (i. e. {{the ability}} of plants to reproduce vegetatively) is particularly important to explain species persistence. A clonal individual may {{be considered as a}} network of interconnected ramets that colonizes space. Resources in this network can be shared and/or stored. We developed an individual-based model (IBM) to simulate the growth of an individual clonal plant. Typically a realistic IBM requires a large set of parameters to adequately represent the complexity of the clonal plant growth. Simulations in the literature are often limited to small subsets of the parameter space and are guided by the a priori knowledge and with heuristic aims of the researcher. The aim of this paper was to demonstrate the benefit of volunteer computing in computational ecology to systematically browse the parameter space and analyze the simulation results in order to draw rigorous conclusions. To be specific, we simulated clonal plant growth using nine growth rules related to the <b>metabolic</b> process, plant <b>architecture,</b> resource sharing and storage and nineteen input parameters. We chose 2 - 4 values per input parameter which corresponded to 20 millions of combinations tested through volunteer computing. We used three criteria to evaluate plant performance: plant total resource, ramet production and maximum length of one branch. The 1 % top-performing plants were sorted according to these criteria. Plant total resource and ramet production were correlated while considering the top-performing plants. The maximum length of one branch was independent from the other two performance traits. We detected two processes promoting {{at least one of the}} plant performance traits: (i) a relatively high metabolic gain (high photosynthetic activity and low production cost for new growth units), a low resource storage and long integration distance for resource sharing; (ii) short spacer lengths and the predominance of elongation of existing branches over branching. Interactive effects between parameter values were demonstrated for more than half of the input parameters. Best performance was reached for plants with slightly different combinations of values for these parameters (i. e. different strategies) rather than a single one (i. e. unique strategy). This modeling approach with volunteer computing enabled us to proceed to large-scale virtual experiments which provided a new quality of insight into ecological processes linked with clonal plant growth...|$|R
