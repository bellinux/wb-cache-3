40|$|A set {{of burning}} {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the influence of smoke vent height and <b>exhausting</b> velocity on <b>mechanical</b> smoke <b>exhausting</b> efficiency.

For each certain exhausting velocity, there is a critical value of distance between the vent and the bottom of the smoke layer. When the distance is less than the critical value, the smoke exhausting is inefficient, and the efficiency decreases sharply as the distance decreases. Contrarily, when the distance is greater than the critical value, a good efficiency can be acquired and the exhausted smoke increased relatively slowly as the distance increases. A critical Froude number, proposed by Hinkley to predict the onset of plug-holing effect in gravity venting systems, was validated in the experiments.

40|$|Although {{the cabin}} design {{is widely used}} for {{providing}} fire safety in big and tall public transport terminals in the Far East, there are many debates on its performance. Very few experimental studies with big fires in a cabin were reported in the literature. In many applications, smoke exhaust was at low level in the cabin. The performance of such systems has to be justified. Full-scale burning tests were carried out to study smoke exhaust at low levels in a cabin fire. A cabin of length 3 m, width 4 m and height 3 m was constructed. Smoke temperature, average smoke layer height in the cabin, and velocity in the fan duct were measured with different heat release rates and heights of the ventilation opening. Eight sets of tests were carried out with results reported in this paper. For smoke exhaust at low level, the interface of smoke layer was low, usually lower than {{the height of the}} ventilation opening. The fire plume was then at the continuous flame zone. The interface of the smoke layer would be tilted. The smoke layer near the <b>mechanical</b> <b>exhaust</b> ventilation was lower than that at the opposite wall. The calculated smoke production rate would then be lower than the <b>mechanical</b> <b>exhaust</b> rate, as air would be extracted directly from the lower layer. In designing <b>mechanical</b> <b>exhaust</b> system in a cabin, the plume coefficient should be tuned up by a factor.

It investigates theperformance of various smoke control systems for use in {{underground}} stations having only one exit to ground level.

Simulations were performed using Fire Dynamics Simulator, investigating two different heat release rates – 20 MW and 60 MW. The results show that both the pressurizing supply air system and the <b>mechanical</b> <b>exhaust</b> air system provide effective smoke control. The advantages of a positive pressure supply air system are a relatively simple installation and a lower requisite flow capacity of the fans. The disadvantage is that the smoke is not dispelled, but can be spread to other platforms of the station and even to the next station. The advantages of a mecha- nical exhaust system are that the hot smoke is removed, and that the spread of smoke is restricted to the platform directly exposed to the fire. Disadvantages include the needfor a duct system, which requires space, and considerably higher fan capacities. METRO-projekte...|$|E

Among other functions, they are absolutely necessary to ensure oxygen levels needed for household combustion appliances. In Portugal in multifamily housing and with natural ventilation systems, installing a <b>mechanical</b> <b>exhaust</b> fan in every kitchen (decentralized ventilation) is common.

However, the design criteria are not clearly demonstrated {{to be worked}} out through systematic full-scale tests. There are many arguments on sizing the exhaust fans, and whether a high exhaust rate is required in an atrium is a puzzle. Atrium hot smoke tests might be required to be carried out occasionally to evaluate their performance, especially when the design does not comply with the prescriptive code in having a high-enough exhaust rate. Experimental studies on <b>mechanical</b> smoke <b>exhaust</b> systems are necessary and have been carried out. The results are reported in this paper.

The second goal is to further improve the ventilation systems on their IAQ-performance while minimizing their energy consumption.
