25|$|As a {{conversation}} piece people have frequently asked me which of my many wickets has given <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> pleasure...I no longer stop to think. My answer does not concern one wicket but three. Those of Alan Turner and the Chappell brothers, Ian and Greg...I felt each one proved a point. That I was not {{over the hill}} as a Test fast bowler despite having been ignored for eight Test matches at home and two tours abroad. Each of these three batsman was well beaten by a good delivery, two out leg before and Ian Chappell caught behind. Down at leg after that opening spell I bloody nearly cried.|$|E
500|$|For Streep, {{the most}} {{significant}} thing about the film was that [...] "his was the first time, on any movie I have ever made, where men {{came up to me}} and said, 'I know what you felt like, this is kind of like my life.' That was for <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> ground-breaking thing about Devil Wears Prada—it engaged men on a visceral level," [...] she told Indiewire.|$|E

A lot of times people will hear songs that I write that are not the typical songs people look at as 'Mariah Carey songs.' ...|$|E

500|$|While Adams brought {{energy and}} {{dedication}} to the presiding officer's chair, he found the task [...] "not quite adapted to my character." [...] Ever cautious about going beyond the constitutional limits of the vice-presidency or of encroaching upon presidential prerogative, Adams often ended up lamenting what he viewed as the [...] "complete insignificance" [...] of his situation. To his wife Abigail he wrote, [...] "My country has in its wisdom contrived for <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> insignificant office that ever the invention of man [...] [...] [...] or his imagination contrived or his imagination conceived; and as I can do neither good nor evil, I must be borne away by others and met the common fate." ...|$|E
500|$|Hendrickson told TVSource {{magazine}} {{that she was}} [...] "petrified" [...] of filming the heavily emotional storyline. She stated, [...] "I was just really intimidated because I don’t have a child.

I think that’s what scared <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> – how I {{was going to find}} it within myself to tell a truthful story." [...] Having previously noted that becoming a mother [...] "matured" [...] Chloe, Hendrickson said, [...] "I would love to see {{a little bit of the}} old Chloe come out of this extreme loss that she’s just experienced.

500|$|TVSquad {{reviewer}} Jonathon Toomey {{gave the}} first episode 9 out of 10 and said of it that [...] "This show is legit, well-worth watching. The only reason I'm holding back that last star is because the screener DVD I received only had the pilot episode and I suppose it's possible that the show could go downhill after that. But I wouldn't bet on it. [...] " [...] Toomey also later added another review of the premiere, stating that [...] "I'm worried though. Dexter is good. In fact, it's really good. That's why I'm worried. Why? Because Showtime has a nasty little habit of canceling great shows. There was The Chris Isaak Show. Then Dead Like <b>Me.</b> <b>The</b> <b>most</b> recent casualty? Huff. All three of those shows were spectacular. And you know what? Dexter is better than all of them. So, yeah... I'm worried." ...|$|E
500|$|Beyond {{his role}} in the Senate, Adams played a minor role in the {{politics}} of the early 1790s. During his two vice-presidential terms, Adams attended few cabinet meetings, and the president sought his counsel only infrequently. Nonetheless, the two men, according to Ferling, [...] "jointly executed many more of the executive branch's ceremonial undertakings than would be likely for a contemporary president and vice-president." [...] Overall, while Adams brought energy and dedication to the office, he found the task [...] "not quite adapted to my character...too inactive, and mechanical." [...] He often lamented what he viewed as the [...] "complete insignificance" [...] of his situation. To his wife Abigail he once wrote, [...] "My country has in its wisdom contrived for <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> insignificant office that ever the invention of man [...] [...] [...] or his imagination contrived or his imagination conceived; and as I can do neither good nor evil, I must be borne away by others and met the common fate." ...|$|E
500|$|... “I didn't {{write my}} raps down {{for my first}} four albums — like at all, I did it from the head {{straight}} to the booth. But on this last album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, I wrote it. I really put myself in the zone that my life was dependent {{on the success of}} this album. With that being the case, I said, ‘You know what? No matter what anybody says about me, they won’t — I can write something that can make someone that hates <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> have to really respect or love the song.’ So even a song like ‘Power,’ I spent 5,000 hours writing it, and it’s really the psychology behind the lyrics; it’s not just blatantly, ‘I’ve got all the power’ — ‘No one man should have all that power.’ It’s worded it in a really sensitive way that opens it up for everyone. Even if I use first person and say ‘I, I, I,’ it’s always for everyone." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} written by Jason Wade, who {{originally}} finished the song {{in a hotel room}} after he visited a friend in Nashville who needed a kidney transplant. It was produced by John Fields and Scott Faircloff. In an interview with Alternative Addiction, Wade said, [...] "Broken is the song that moves <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>most.</b> I wrote it in Nashville, about 6 months ago. I was in my hotel room at 3 AM, I was out there visiting a friend... he’s really sick, he needs a kidney transplant." [...] Furthermore, he said, [...] "That [...] song just kinda fell in my lap, and I really haven’t written a song like that since 'Hanging by a Moment' where it just happened within a 15 minute time period." [...] Broken was released as the third single from the album on June 18, 2007. The song was then edited for radio to give it more of a [...] "rock" [...] feel and was released via digital download on July 8, 2008.|$|E
500|$|In later years, Fellini {{explained}} that from [...] "a sentimental point of view," [...] he was [...] "most attached" [...] to La Strada: [...] "Above all, because I {{feel that it}} is my most representative film, the one that is the most autobiographical; for both personal and sentimental reasons, because it is the film that I had the greatest trouble in realizing and that gave <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> difficulty {{when it came time to}} find a producer." [...] Of all the imaginary beings he had brought to the screen, Fellini felt closest to the three principals of La Strada, [...] "especially Zampanò." [...] Anthony Quinn found working for Fellini invaluable: [...] "He drove me mercilessly, making me do scene after scene over and over again until he got what he wanted. I learned more about film acting in three months with Fellini than I'd learned in all the movies I'd made before then." [...] Long afterwards, in 1990, Quinn sent a note to the director and his co-star: [...] "The two of you are the highest point in my life -- Antonio." ...|$|E
500|$|Stebbins' {{early work}} with lizards in the {{southern}} California desert led {{to a series of}} papers from the 1950s through the 1970s exploring the parietal eye of reptiles (also called the [...] "third eye", a tiny light-sensitive organ on the forehead) and the associated pineal gland, both of which are now known to influence circadian rhythms. Aided by a Senior Postdoctoral Fellowship from the National Science Foundation, Stebbins and colleagues found that lizards with the parietal eye surgically removed changed their behavior: they became active much earlier in the day, spent more time in the sun, and remained active much later than control lizards. Further studies over the next few decades focused on the parietal eye of the tuatara, the pineal gland's effects on lizard reproductive behavior, and parietal skull openings in fossil [...] "mammal-like reptiles" [...] such as Lystrosaurus. His work had implications beyond reptile biology: Nobel laureate Julius Axelrod, after reading the work of Stebbins and others, began investigating the pineal gland in mammals, with emphasis on the effect of melatonin on activity cycles. Melatonin has since been found to influence human health. Stebbins was proud of his parietal and pineal work, calling it [...] "possibly the single piece of research which gives <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> satisfaction." ...|$|E

500|$|Travers {{also named}} The Incredibles as #6 {{on his list}} of the decade's best films, writing [...] "Of all the Pixar miracles studded through the decade, The Incredibles still delights <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>most.</b> It's not every toon that deals with midlife crisis, marital dysfunction, child neglect, {{impotence}} fears, fashion faux pas, and existential angst." [...] The National Review Online named The Incredibles no. 2 on its list of the 25 best conservative movies of the last 25 years, saying that it [...] "celebrates marriage, courage, responsibility, and high achievement." [...] Entertainment Weekly named the film No. 25 on its list of the 25 greatest action films ever and no. 7 on its list of the 20 best animated movies ever. IGN ranked the film as the third favorite animated film of all time in a list published in 2010. In 2012, film critic Matt Zoller Seitz declared The Incredibles as the greatest superhero film he has ever seen: [...] "That thing works as a James Bond spoof; a meditation on identities, secret and otherwise; a domestic comedy; a statement on exceptionalism vs. mediocrity, and the perils of the nanny state… And yet it all hangs together. No part feels perfunctory or stupid. It’s all deeply felt." [...] He would also later name the film as the [...] "greatest action movie of the aughts, with [...] and [...] following close behind." ...|$|E
500|$|Yankee outfielder Bob Cerv {{recalled}} of the rivalry, [...] "I {{always remember}} the games when Pierce and Ford would lock up. Those were great ballgames – 2–1, 3–2. Usually, if they'd get beat, Mantle would {{hit a home}} run." [...] New York outfielder Hank Bauer noted, [...] "The guy who gave <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> problem – I know he gave 'em to me, and I think he gave 'em {{to most of us}} – was Billy Pierce." [...] Tommy Byrne, who pitched for the Yankees for most of his career from 1943 to 1957 but played for Chicago {{for the first half of}} the 1953 season, said, [...] "Pierce was sneaky fast, a good breaking ball. He was tough. For several years there he was right up there on a par with Ford." [...] Sportswriter Bill Madden recalled in 1982, [...] "Always it was Pierce against Whitey Ford and always, to me, that seemed like an unfair matchup. They were your classic 'stylish' left-handers, equal in guile and guts, but Ford had those howitzers of Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Bill Skowron and Hank Bauer behind him, while Pierce came armed with popguns. Nellie Fox, Luis Aparicio and Minnie Miñoso supported him with hustle and chink singles and I always marveled at the fact that Pierce could duel Ford on even terms despite those odds." [...] Ironically, the Yankees tried to acquire Pierce in the early 1950s when Ford was in the military, but White Sox general manager Frank Lane proposed that New York give up Bauer, first baseman Joe Collins and second baseman Jerry Coleman in exchange for Pierce and outfielder Al Zarilla, and ended talks when Yankees GM George Weiss suggested the Yankees send minor leaguers instead.|$|E
