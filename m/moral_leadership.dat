40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} <b>leadership,</b> <b>moral</b> integrity, {{and difficulties}} in ensuring <b>moral</b> integrity in <b>leadership.</b> The chapter advances the following arguments: (1) It does matter how is in charge, and {{the available evidence}} does not unequivocally support the objections to this view. (2) The personal qualities that matter in leaders include moral integrity. (3) Some of the processes that determine access to positions of leadership are insufficiently sensitive to relevant personal characteristics. (4) In particular, the top-down or bureaucratic processes that exist in many organizations {{are less likely than}} bottom-up processes to eliminate <b>leadership</b> candidates with <b>moral</b> flaws. The authors argue that <b>moral</b> integrity in <b>leadership</b> matters because of the opportunities to do immense harm available to those who occupy leadership positions. Lack of moral integrity in a leader is thus of far greater consequence than lack of conscience, self-control, or tolerance in any private citizen acting alone...|$|R

25|$|The {{doctrines of}} papal primacy and papal {{supremacy}} {{are perhaps the}} greatest obstacles to ecumenical efforts between the Roman Catholic Church and the other Christian churches.

Many Protestants are quite willing to grant the pope a position of special <b>moral</b> <b>leadership,</b> but feel that according any more formal authority to the pope than that would conflict with the Protestant principle of solus Christus, i.e., {{that there can be}} no intermediaries between a Christian and God except for Christ.|$|E

However, Mexico experienced a strong economic recession in 1982 and the Mexican peso suffered a devaluation. In the United States president Ronald Reagan attempted to move the United States back towards a hard anti-communist line in foreign affairs, in what his supporters saw {{as an attempt to}} assert <b>moral</b> <b>leadership</b> (compared to the Soviet Union) in the world community.

40|$|The {{increasingly}} globalized {{environment of}} the 21 st century is rapidly changing the way business is conducted and reshaping the requirements of effective leadership. Leaders who possess a global perspective with global competencies are being called {{to the forefront of}} organizations. An understanding of globalization is tantamount to an exploration of the theories and approaches to global leadership. More importantly, global leadership must be examined in light of the Biblical directive of authentic and <b>moral</b> Christian <b>leadership.</b> Globalization is characterized by the adoption of a global frame of reference or global level consideration for activities that would normally occur at a local, national or regional level (Hicks, 2010). It {{can be seen as a}} set of processes encompassing cultural, social, technological, ethical, political and economic developments. Globalization, therefore, is an intricate network of countries, institutions and people that has given rise to an interdependent world (Ivancevich, Konopaske, & Matteson, 2005). It is this closer integration of countries and the prospect of free-trade-for-all (Stiglitz, 2006) that evokes a closer examination of the concept of global leadership with a comparison to the Biblical call to <b>moral</b> Christian <b>leadership.</b> Seeking to Define Global Leadership Unlike the extensive literature available on the definition of leadership (Stogdilll, 1974) global leadership is a nascent field that has little to offer in terms of systematic research into its theory, definition and concepts.
