25|$|Following {{the devastation}} from the {{phylloxera}} epidemic {{in the late}} 19th century, many vineyards were replanted with high yielding grape varieties such as Cinsaut. By the early 1900s {{there was a large}} glut of wine, creating a wine lake effect which led some producers to pour their unsaleable wine into local rivers and streams. The depressed prices caused by this out-of-balance supply and demand dynamic prompted the South African government to fund the formation of the Koöperatieve Wijnbouwers Vereniging van Zuid-Afrika Bpkt (KWV) in 1918. Initially started as a co-operative, the KWV soon grew in power and prominence, setting policies and prices for the entire South African wine industry. To deal with the wine glut the KWV restricted yields and set <b>minimum</b> <b>prices,</b> encouraging the production of brandy and fortified wines.|$|E

40|$|To control Medicaid's {{expenditure}} on prescription drugs, 1990 legislation {{established a}} rebate program guaranteeing Medicaid a rebate on each unit purchased by Medicaid participants. The rebate {{is the difference}} between the <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> and the average manufacturer <b>price</b> (<b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> rule) or a proportion of the average manufacturer price (average price rule). We characterize the optimal pricing strategy of a third-degree price discriminating monopolist under these rules. Under the <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> rule, the <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> gross of rebate always increases whereas prices gross of rebate in {{at least some of the}} markets always decrease. In contrast, under the average price rule, these prices may move in the same direction in all markets, with all increasing in some circumstances and all decreasing in others. We also examine the effects of such provisions on social welfare. We analyze a modified version of our <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> rule model suitable for applications beyond Medicaid. ...|$|R
40|$|THERE HAVE BEEN {{calls for}} Ireland {{to follow suit}} after Scotland pushed ahead with plans to {{introduce}} a <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> for alcohol. <b>Minimum</b> <b>pricing</b> – which sets a ‘floor’ beneath which alcohol cannot be sold – stops retailers from selling alcohol cheaply {{in a bid to}} prevent people from binge drinking. The Irish government has been debating whether to set a <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> on alcohol, with Minister for Health James Reilly saying he supports the introduction – but a number of government ministers have said they are concerned about the proposal. A judge ruled on Friday that plans by the Scottish government to set a <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> on alcohol is legal after a drinks industry body went to court to say that the government did not have the power to implement such a rule as it would interfere with trade. Scotland plans to set a <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> of alcohol at 50 p a unit (59 c). “The ruling is a significant one, not just for Scotland, but also for Ireland and the other EU countries which are seeking to introduce <b>minimum</b> <b>pricing</b> to tackle alcohol-related harm,” said Conor Cullen of Alcohol Action Ireland...|$|R
25|$|Reform of {{the economy}} was {{the goal of the}} National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933. It sought to end {{cutthroat}} competition by forcing industries to come up with codes that established the rules of operation for all firms within specific industries, such as <b>minimum</b> <b>prices,</b> agreements not to compete, and production restrictions. Industry leaders negotiated the codes which were approved by NIRA officials. Industry needed to raise wages as a condition for approval. Provisions encouraged unions and suspended antitrust laws. NIRA was found to be unconstitutional by unanimous decision of the US Supreme Court in May 1935; Roosevelt strongly protested. Roosevelt reformed the financial regulatory structure of the nation with the Glass–Steagall Act, creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to underwrite savings deposits. The act also sought to curb speculation by limiting affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms. In 1934, the Securities and Exchange Commission was created to regulate the trading of securities, while the Federal Communications Commission was established to regulate telecommunications.|$|E

25|$|The Maize Control Board (MCB) {{formed in}} 1947 was {{supposed}} to ensure that Malawi’s maize supplies were maintained and to guarantee <b>minimum</b> <b>prices</b> to farmers. It was given wide powers of control over maize marketing, but as maize could be grown or almost anywhere, its objectives were unattainable with the limited organisation it had. The MCB was hampered by lack of funds; it was reluctant to promote higher maize production for the local market on grounds of cost, and up to 1949 it also discouraged growing for export. To {{cover the cost of}} a country-wide network, the Board fixed a very low buying price and sold maize at double this price. The low prices that the MCB paid in the period 1945-1951 discouraged farmers from growing maize in excess of their own requirements, and inhibited the development of commercial grain markets. By paying the same price in remote areas as in accessible ones and by maintaining price floors in years of surplus, the MCB hoped to create grain reserves. However, as it paid only a penny for two to three pounds of maize against a market price of at least a penny a pound, growers lacked any incentive to produce for it and withheld their surpluses from their market. The quantities of maize available for the home market dropped significantly at a time of growing demand caused by poor harvests in the run up to the major famine in 1949.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the allocation problem of assigning heterogenous objects {{to a group}} of agents and determining how much they should pay. Each agent receives at most one object. Agents have non-quasi-linear preferences over bundles, each consisting of an object and a payment.

The <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> rule assigns a <b>minimum</b> <b>price</b> (Walrasian) equilibrium to each preference profile.

2500|$|The Douro Wine Company (also {{known as}} the General Company of Agriculture of the Wines of the Upper Douro and in Portuguese Companhia Geral da Agricultura e Vinhos do Alto Douro) was a {{government}} oversight organization established by the Portuguese Prime Minister Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal to regulate the trade and production of Port wine. Established in 1756, {{one of the first}} official duties of the company was the delineation of the boundaries of the Douro wine region. This act essentially made the Douro the world's first regional appellation. While the boundaries of the Chianti and Tokaji wine regions were outlined in 1716 and 1737, respectively, neither of these regions were [...] "technically" [...] appellations in the sense of being subjected to continued government control and regulations. Under their charter, Pombal invested an immense amount of control in the Douro Wine Company to regulate all exports of Port, set production quantities limits, fix maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>prices</b> for grapes and to serve as sole arbitrator in any disputes between vine growers and Port shippers. In 1761, the company was further granted a monopoly on the sale of brandy which was used in the fortification process of Port winemaking. The Douro Wine Company continued to operate to 1833 (and was briefly revived from 1843 and 1853). Today, many of it functions have been deregulated with the Instituto dos Vinhos do Douro e do Porto or (Port and Douro Wines Institute) being the official regulating body of Port wine and Douro table wine production.|$|E
