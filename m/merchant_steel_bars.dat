This series of experiments, named Experiments 6, aimed to determine the threshold values of NaCl concentrations in concrete for <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> rusting. A method of electrical potential difference measurements of spots of concrete specimen surfaces over Cu/CuSO_ 4 half cell, having been developed by California Division of Highways and having been widely used to detect the rusting spots of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> in concrete, are also performed in this series of experiments. We planned to examine the method, if it can be applicable to the RC structures in Okinawa Prefecture to detect rusting spots. The following results about <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion are obtained by and at six months after embedding <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> in concrete. 1. <b>Steel</b> <b>bars</b> in the concrete contained 0. 033 % of NaCl have not corroded yet without adding any amount of corrosion inhibitors. 2. <b>Steel</b> <b>bars</b> in the concrete contained 0. 067 % of NaCl do not also corrode yet, if adequate amount of corrosion inhibitors are added to the concrete. 3. In case of the concrete contained 0. 100 % of NaCl by weight, there have been <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> corroded some, but their areas of corrosion were small. Some of the <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> have no corrosion spots where adequate amount of corrosion inhibitors had added to the concrete. 4. All <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> in the concrete contained 0. 133 % of NaCl by weight except A_ 4 D_ 2 C_ 2 O_ 1 specimens have been observed some corrosion. And as the time has passed, the areas of corrosion on <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> surfaces are becoming larger. 5. There have not been any significant differences in the effects of types of corrosion inhibitors on <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion. 6. The effects of water-cement ratio on corrosion of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> are not obvious. 7. The beneficial effects of doubled dosage of corrosion inhibitors into concrete are observed on <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion. The results of electrical potential measurments on the basis of Cu/CuSO_ 4 half cell are as follows. 1. It has not been decided yet that the standards of California Division of Highways on <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion in concrete can be applicable to the RC structures in Okinawa Prefecture. 2. <b>Steel</b> <b>bars</b> in concrete need not be connected by metalic means each other when half cell potential measurment method is applied. 3. Rusting spots on <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> surfaces have high potentials, and the electrical circuit directly contained a rusting spot exhibit high potentials in the sense of absolute value. 4.

40|$|Due {{to violent}} {{fluctuation}} of raw material {{prices in the}} international market, the domestic <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> index reached its peak in June 2008. As <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> are massive materials required for constructional engineering, {{it has become an}} urgent potential issue in the research of construction management by considering how to minimize their consumption and waste. In engineering practice, the experienced <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> engineer of the subcontractor is usually assigned to prepare the construction drawing and the material selection list. Taking account of the easier cutting of <b>steel</b> <b>bars,</b> convenient workability and material management, it is frequently required that the length of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> should be processed into a number that is a multiple of 5 cm or 10 cm so as to minimize the diversity of sizes; sometimes, the required length of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> is also lengthened to match the size of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> with a larger quantity in the Material Selection List. Along with the expansion of construction scale, the type of <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> size is also becoming more complicated. It is frequently seen that shorter bars are wrongly replaced by longer ones due to the confusion of <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> sizes during <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> erection, overlapping and binding, this has lead to waste of <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> material. Since relevant literature relating to <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> material expenditure and control only deal with the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> cutting issues at the initial construction stage, but lacks the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> arrangement required by practical construction, the aforesaid waste during field construction has not been effectively improved until now. For this reason, the floor deck <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> arrangement of the building construction will be selected as the example for this Research. By adjusting the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> splicing position, the size of originally required <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> will be changed. Further, the “K-means Clustering Algorithm” is also used to configure the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> clustering mode so as to reduce the diversified sizes of <b>steel</b> <b>bars.</b> As a further step, the Linear Programming Method will be employed to acquire the optimal clustering result without increasing the original cost. In this Research, a physical building case will be selected as the example. The said case belongs to an RC structure in which the foundation area size is 65. 4 m (L) x 59. 7 m (W) and is constructed into 4 underground levels and 7 above-ground floors, and each floor is provided with a maximum of 14 horizontal or longitudinal spans. The material selection result indicates that the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> samples having the same number and shape is 694 pieces and this has been divided into 41 groups by length. According to the program-based clustering computation written for this Research, the result indicates that the steel group count will be reduced to 16 groups and the workability will be significantly enhanced accordingly. With the above information, {{it can be seen that}} the statement of this Research is justified and can really be implemented in the practical construction field to achieve the purpose of reducing the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> length types,minimizing construction error and alleviating the work accessibility. 近年來由於國際間原物料價格波動劇烈，至 97 年 6 月份時，國內鋼筋指數達到高峰，而鋼筋對於營建工程來說屬於大宗材料，因此思考如何減低其耗損與浪費，已變成是營建管理研究上極具潛力的一個課題。 一般在工程實務上，鋼筋工程於發包後，有關繪製鋼筋施工圖以及揀料單之工作，多半交由鋼筋分包廠商中工程經驗較為豐富之鋼筋師傅處理，其往往為了鋼筋便於裁切、考慮施工性及材料管理方便，常強制需求鋼筋長度成為尾數為 5 或 10 cm的倍數，藉以降低尺寸之多樣性，甚至是為了配合揀料單中需求數量較多之鋼筋尺寸，將需求鋼筋長度加大。另外隨著工程規模增加，需求鋼筋尺寸種類也越加繁複，所以在鋼筋施工及搭接綁紮時，因鋼筋尺寸混淆，錯以長度較長之鋼筋，取代原有長度較短鋼筋之情形，屢見不鮮，也因此造成鋼筋材料無謂之浪費。然而回顧以往對於鋼筋材料支出控制的相關文獻，僅以工程初期的鋼筋裁切問題作為研究範疇，缺乏針對工程實際鋼筋配筋的需求問題作探討，故上述於實作時所產生材料浪費之情形，迄今仍未獲得有效之改善。 因此，本研究以建築工程樓版配筋為例，利用鋼筋搭接位置的調整，改變原有需求鋼筋尺寸，並採用k-means分群演算法，建構鋼筋分群模式，減少鋼筋繁雜眾多的尺寸，再運用線性規劃方式，求解在不增加原有成本目標下之最佳分群結果。 在本研究中，以一真實建築個案作為範例，該案例為一RC構造建築物，基地面積長約 65. 4 公尺，寬約 59. 7 公尺，建築規模為地下 4 層、地上 7 層，而每層樓版之橫向或縱向跨度最多均為 14 個，經揀料結果，原有相同號數、形狀之需求鋼筋樣本數為 694 個，以長度分類，可分為 41 個群組；經本研究所撰寫程式分群演算結果，鋼筋群組數降低為 16 組，大大增進其工作性，證明本研究之論述，確實可以運用於工程實務上，達到降低鋼筋長度樣態、減少施工錯誤、提昇施工便利性之目的。摘要	 i Abstract	 ii 目錄	 iv 表目錄	 v 圖目錄	 vi 第一章	緒論	 1 1. 1 研究動機及目的	 1 1. 2 研究方法	 4 第二章	問題描述與定義	 6 2. 1 鋼筋工程施工流程	 6 2. 2 營建工程費用結構	 9 2. 3 影響鋼筋工程成本因素	 10 2. 4 鋼筋配筋分群問題	 11 2. 4. 1 背景描述	 11 2. 4. 2 問題定義	 12 第三章	文獻回顧	 13 3. 1 鋼筋配筋問題	 13 3. 2 K-means分群演算法	 28 3. 3 線性規劃	 34 第四章	數學建模	 35 4. 1 符號定義	 35 4. 1. 1 決策變數	 35 4. 1. 2 邊界條件	 36 4. 2 模式建構與求解步驟	 36 第五章	範例實證	 40 5. 1 案例說明	 40 5. 2 求解分析	 47 第六章	結論與後續研究	 52 6. 1 結論	 52 6. 2 後續研究	 53 參考文獻	 54 附錄A 版配筋揀料明細	 A- 1 附錄B 程式資料編碼	 B- 1 附錄C 鋼筋分群求解輸出	 C-...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSteel {{has been}} used for many decades in {{structural}} applications because of its good combination of mechanical properties. As per recent concept to reduce steel consumption in reinforced cement concrete (RCC) structures, designers recommend high strength <b>steel</b> <b>bars.</b> There are various routes for their production such as microalloying, thermomechanical treatment, cold working, etc. For <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> of thermomechanical treatment (TMT) route, some designers believe these <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> to be more sensitive to corrosive environment.

However, as the FBG is embedded in the concrete, stresses from all directions will apply to it. In this case, the Bragg wavelength change will attribute to stresses coming from the axial strain as well as the lateral strain. Therefore, the relation between the Bragg wavelength shift and the axial strain of FBG should be modified. We use a cylindrical and elastic model to analyze the strain distribution of a <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> embedded in the concrete, and obtained a new relation between the Bragg wavelength shift of the FBG wrapped around the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> and the axial strain of the fiber.

40|$|Based on {{microcapsule}} technology, a {{new type}} of self-healing system for cementitious composites is established. The performance of the system was characterized by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> immersed in a simulated concrete environment. The results demonstrate strong inhibition of chloride-induced corrosion when microcapsules are added to the solution. A novel equivalent circuit model, which takes into account the inductive effect arising from the generation of corrosion products on the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> surface, is proposed to explain the protection performance of the microcapsules against <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion in a concrete environment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the time series method to forecast {{the evolution of}} pitting depth in corroded reinforcing <b>steel</b> <b>bars.</b> Basic time series analysis models are introduced, and the method for establishing the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is described through an example. Based on ARIMA model, the pitting depth in reinforcing <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> under two different corrosion environments is predicted. The results show that ARIMA model can describe the variation tendency of pitting depth in corroded reinforcing <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> quantitatively. The predicted values and the observed ones are in good conformity...|$|R
40|$|Steel {{corrosion}} {{leads to}} the deterioration of bond between concrete and <b>steel</b> <b>bars.</b> The serviceability and ultimate strength of concrete elements within RC structures are hence affected. Many researchers have studied the bond behavior of corroded <b>steel</b> <b>bars.</b> However, very few studies have investigated the effects of confinements {{on the degradation of}} bond strength. The present paper proposed a new kind of beam specimen based on which the effects of stirrups on degradation of bond were investigated. The test results proved that stirrups can effectively increase the bond strength between concrete and corroded <b>steel</b> <b>bars...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{evaluation}} method of the fatigue durability of the RC slabs for road bridges {{is required to}} effectively manage the maintenance of those, and many researchers have dealt with this problem. However, almost every research emphasizes the RC slabs reinforced with deformed <b>steel</b> <b>bars.</b> On the other hand, it has made clear that many RC slabs reinforced with round bars actually suffer fatal damage and degradation. Under like this condition, in this study, in order to investigate the fatigue durability of the RC slabs reinforced with round <b>steel</b> <b>bars,</b> the wheel running tests was conducted taking two kinds of rebar as variable: deformed and round <b>steel</b> <b>bars.</b> Based on the experimental results, a formula for evaluation of the fatigue lifetime of the slabs reinforced with round <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> is proposed...|$|R
40|$|This investigation, {{involving}} the testing specimens - 6 specimens for the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> under reinforced concrete beam, each 4 specimens for the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> over reinforced concrete beam and the deformed <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> under and over reinforced concrete beams - subjected to 2 concentrated loads in the stake of a/d≒ 1 is to research for fatigue limits of reinforced concrete beam subjected to shearing repeated load. Then, the authors described the variation of strain and deflection, and described that the judicatory standards by a/d of the failured boundary may {{be applied to}} reinforced concrete beams under repeated load as well as static load. Additionaly, they described that the calculated values by the theoretical equations of deflection, bending moment and shear force agree well in the values of experiment. Roughly speaking, the fatigue limits are thought that the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> under and over reinforced concrete beams are approximately 45 per cent, and the deformed <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> under and over reinforced concrete beams are approximately 40 per cent for the failure loads of static tests...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the second}} report {{of the results of}} experiments, named Experiments 6, which aims to {{determine}} the threshold values of NaCl concentrations in concrete for <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> rusting, where corrosion inhibitors exist in concrete. In Experiments 6, there have been small dosages of NaCl in concrete specimens and corrosion inhibitors are also dosed in some specified values. The following results about <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> rusting are obtained when 12 months have passed after <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> had been embedded into concrete. 1. There have been found very small rusting spots on one bar at nine and twelve months after embedding, respectively. The bars above are embedded in the concrete of 0. 033 % NaCl dosage and no corrosion inhibitor. 2. There have been no sign of corrosion {{on the surface of the}} bars in the specimens contained 0. 033 % NaCl and the specified values of corrosion inhibitors. 3. <b>Steel</b> <b>bars</b> in the concrete contained 0. 067 % of NaCl by weight do not also corroded yet except one bar, where adequate amounts of corrosion inhibitors are added into the concrete. 4. In case of the standard specified dosage of corrosion inhibitors, there have been some amounts of rusting areas on <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> surfaces embedded in the concrete of 0. 100 % NaCl concentration, and appreciable amounts of corrosion areas of rusting in the concrete of 0. 133 % NaCl concentration. The above rusting areas have both increased as the time has passed. 5. Two-fold dosage of corrosion inhibitors in concrete has significant effects on inhibiting corrosion of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> in the concrete of 0. 100 % and 0. 133 % NaCl concentration, but in that case, emergence of <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion itself can not be interrupted. 6. There can be said at the time when one year has passed after embedding <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> that "threshold" value of NaCl concentration in concrete on rusting of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> is 0. 067 % by weight of concrete where adequate amounts of corrosion inhibitors exists, and that the value can be raised as much as 0. 100 %...|$|R
