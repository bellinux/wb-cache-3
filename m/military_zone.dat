Colonel Hoang Dan was the deputy commander, and Colonel Nguyen Cong Trang was the deputy political commissar.|$|E
5|$|Not to {{be outdone}} by the Vietnamese {{military}} build-up, the Government of Democratic Kampuchea was busy strengthening its armed forces with Chinese support. In previous years, China had only provided the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army with {{a limited amount of}} arms and ammunition, but as relations with Vietnam worsened in 1978, Beijing established additional supply routes through Kampuchea and increased the volume of military hardware which travelled down each route. On the eve of the Vietnamese invasion, Kampuchea had an estimated 73,000 soldiers in the Eastern <b>Military</b> <b>Zone</b> bordering Vietnam. At that time, all branches of the Kampuchean armed forces were significantly strengthened by large quantities of Chinese-made military equipment, which included fighter aircraft, patrol boats, heavy artillery, anti-aircraft guns, trucks and tanks. Additionally, there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Chinese advisers in both military and civilian capacities, providing their support to the Khmer Rouge regime.|$|E
5|$|On February 21, 1975, North Vietnamese field commanders from Tri-Thien <b>Military</b> <b>Zone</b> and the 2nd Army Corps held {{a conference}} to {{establish}} their objectives, which were planned to occur in two phases; the spring-summer phase that would begin in March and probably conclude in May, and the autumn phase to last from July to August 1975. The North Vietnamese objective was {{to take control of}} Quảng Trị Province, isolate the city of Huế and if the opportunity presents itself, they would capture the entire Tri Thien-Huế area. To isolate Huế, the North Vietnamese 2nd Army Corps would move against their target from the north-west direction along Route 12 down to the south-west along Highway 14, thereby isolating the region from South Vietnamese forces in II Corps Tactical Zone.|$|E

25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of March 11, ARVN General Le Nguyen Khang ordered the 345th Armoured Squadron to move out from Bau Don to relieve the <b>military</b> <b>zone</b> of Dau Tienh, but they were defeated by the North Vietnamese 16th Infantry Regiment at Suoi Ong Hung, and were forced to retreat to their base. At the same time, South Vietnamese artillery units at Bau Don and Rung Nan were subdued by elements of the 9th Infantry Division, so {{they were unable to}} return fire. By March 13, the North Vietnamese army was in complete control of the Dầu Tiếng <b>military</b> <b>zone.</b> After three hours of fighting, the North Vietnamese 3/9th Infantry Division also captured South Vietnamese positions at Vuon Chuoi, Nga ba Sac, Cau Tau and Ben Cui. The ARVN 3rd Brigade had planned to retake Dầu Tiếng using elements of the 5th Infantry Division, but President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu ordered them to pull back and defend Truong Mit, Bau Don and Tây Ninh instead.|$|E

50|$|In early 1975 the Guinean {{military}} {{consisted of}} an army of around 5,000, an air force of 300, and a naval component of around 200. The army comprised four infantry battalions, one armoured battalion, and one engineer battalion. In the early 1970s the armed forces were organised into four <b>military</b> <b>zones,</b> corresponding to the four geographical regions (Lower Guinea, Middle Guinea, Upper Guinea, and Guinée forestière). One of the four infantry battalions was assigned {{to each of the}} <b>military</b> <b>zones.</b> The zone headquarters also doubled as battalion headquarters, and acted as a supervisory element for elements of company and platoon size assigned to each of the country's twenty-nine administrative regions.|$|R

25|$|During the militarization of {{northern}} Chiba Prefecture {{that began in}} the early 20th century, the eastern area of the plateau was declared a <b>military</b> <b>zone.</b> The Shimōsa Plateau was a center of the manufacture of war goods, notably of munitions and military aircraft, and saw the construction of numerous military facilities. Shimofusa Air Base was constructed in 1945 by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force on the border of Kashiwa and Kamagaya. Most of the military facilities and industrial areas on the Shimōsa Plateau were destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II.|$|E
50|$|In 2004 {{the army}} has gone beyond its accord-mandated target, and has {{implemented}} troop reductions from an estimated 28,000 to 15,500 troops, including subordinate air force (1,000) and navy (1,000) elements. It is equipped with armaments and material from the United States, Israel, Taiwan, Argentina, Spain, and France. As part of the army downsizing, the operational structure of 19 <b>military</b> <b>zones</b> and three strategic brigades are being recast as several <b>military</b> <b>zones</b> are eliminated and their area of operations absorbed by others.

However, {{only a fraction of}} this can be used by Palestinians in the West Bank. Israel has denied Palestinians access to the entire Lower Jordan River since 1967. After the start of Israel’s military occupation in 1967, Israel declared the West Bank land adjacent to the Jordan River a closed <b>military</b> <b>zone,</b> to which only Israeli settler farmers have been permitted access.|$|E
25|$|The British {{built the}} Lahore Railway Station {{just outside the}} Walled City shortly after the Mutiny of 1857, and so built the station {{in the style of}} a medieval castle to ward of any {{potential}} future uprisings, with thick walls, turrets, and holes to direct gun and cannon fire for defence of the structure. Lahore's most prominent government institutions and commercial enterprises came to be concentrated in Civil Station in a half-mile wide area flanking The Mall, where unlike in Lahore's <b>military</b> <b>zone,</b> the British and locals were allowed to mix.

25|$|Despite his {{difficult}} {{relationship with}} the Senate, Tiberius' first years were generally good. He stayed true to Augustus’s plans for the succession and favored his adopted son and nephew Germanicus over his natural son, Drusus, as did the Roman populace. On Tiberius' request, Germanicus was granted proconsular power and assumed command in the prime <b>military</b> <b>zone</b> of Germania, where he suppressed the mutiny there and led the formerly restless legions on campaigns against Germanic tribes from AD 14 to 16. Germanicus died in Syria in AD 19 and, on his deathbed, accused the governor of Syria, Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, of murdering him at Tiberius’s orders. With Germanicus dead, Tiberius began elevating his own son Drusus to replace him as the Imperial successor. By this time Tiberius had left more of the day-to-day running of the Empire to Lucius Aelius Sejanus.|$|E
25|$|Between April 10 and 11, {{elements}} of the North Vietnamese 7th Infantry Division tried to destroy the ARVN 18th Infantry Division, the 52nd Task Force and the 5 Armoured Cavalry, but on each occasion {{they were forced to}} stop and deal with enemy counter-attacks on their flanks. In the northwest the North Vietnamese 226th and 270th Infantry Regiments, from the 341st Infantry Division, were also forced to deal with counter-attacks staged by the ARVN 43rd Infantry Regiment and the 322nd Armoured Brigade.

25|$|The North Vietnamese 4th Army Corps Command {{selected}} Dầu Tiếng–Chon Thanh as {{the first}} target for their operation, {{as it was the}} weakest point in the South Vietnamese defensive line in the north-west area. South Vietnam maintained four regional force battalions (35th, 304th, 312th and 352nd Battalions) which totalled 2,600 soldiers in the area, along with one armoured brigade and ten 105mm artillery guns.

To continue their support of ground troops at Xuan Loc, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force mobilised the 4th Air Force Division based at Tra Noc to conduct further missions. On the same day, the North Vietnamese 6th Infantry Division and the 95B Infantry Regiment defeated a combined ARVN formation which included the 52nd Task Force and the 13th Armoured Squadron west of Xuan Loc.
