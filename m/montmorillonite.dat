25|$|The {{common clay}} {{minerals}} are <b>montmorillonite</b> or smectite, illite, and kaolinite or kaolin. These minerals tend {{to form in}} sheet or plate like structures, with length typically ranging between 10−7m and 4x10−6m and thickness typically ranging between 10−9m and 2x10−6m, {{and they have a}} relatively large specific surface area. The specific surface area (SSA) is defined as the ratio of the surface area of particles to the mass of the particles. Clay minerals typically have specific surface areas in the range of 10 to 1,000 square meters per gram of solid. Due to the large surface area available for chemical, electrostatic, and van der Waals interaction, the mechanical behavior of clay minerals is very sensitive to the amount of pore fluid available and the type and amount of dissolved ions in the pore fluid. To anticipate the effect of clay on the way a soil will behave, it is necessary to know the kinds of clays as well as the amount present. As home builders and highway engineers know all too well, soils containing certain high-activity clays make very unstable material on which to build because they swell when wet and shrink when dry. This shrink-and-swell action can easily crack foundations and cause retaining walls to collapse. These clays also become extremely sticky and difficult to work with when they are wet. In contrast, low-activity clays, formed under different conditions, can be very stable and easy to work with.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the role of}} formamide, {{a product of the}} hydrolysis of hydrogen cyanide, as precursor of several components of nucleic acids under prebiotic conditions. When formamide is heated in the presence of <b>montmorillonites,</b> the efficient one pot synthesis of purine, adenine, cytosine, and uracil is obtained. Along with these nucleobases, several components of the inosine pathway are obtained: 5 -aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamide, 5 -formamido-imidazole- 4 -carboxamide and hypoxanthine.

Selectivity of biotite and illite was limited to small concentrations of K, however. At greater concentrations the selectivity of vermiculite for K exceeded the selectivity of the micas. The greater selectivity of vermiculites than <b>montmorillonites</b> for K and Cs ions was attributed to the greater layer charge density in vermiculites. The greater selectivity of micas than <b>montmorillonites</b> and vermiculites was attributed to the frayed edges of micas in addition to their larger layer charge density.

The analog spectra were measured under differing environmental conditions to evaluate the influence of exposure history on water content and absorption features due to H 2 O in these samples. Each of these materials contains structural OH bonded to metal cations, adsorbed H 2 O, and bound H 2 O (either in a glass, structural site, or bound to a cation). Previous experiments involving a variety of Mars analogs have shown that the 3 micron H 2 O band in spectra of palagonites is more resistant to drying than the 3 micron H 2 O band in spectra of <b>montmorillonites.</b> Other experiments have shown that spectra of ferrihydrite and <b>montmorillonites</b> doped with ferric sulfate also contain sufficient bound H 2 O to retain a strong 3 micron band under dry conditions.

40|$|International audienceImportant {{structural}} modifications {{occur in}} swelling clays upon water adsorption. The multi-scale {{evolution of the}} swelling clay structure is usually evidenced by various experimental techniques. However, {{the driving force behind}} such phenomena is still not thoroughly understood. It appears strongly dependent {{on the nature of the}} interlayer cation. In the case of <b>montmorillonites</b> saturated with alkaline cations, it was inferred that the compensating cation or the layer surface could control the hydration process and thus the opening of the interlayer space, depending on the nature of the interlayer cation. In the present study, emphasis is put on the impact of divalent alkaline-earth cations compensating the layer charge in <b>montmorillonites.</b> Since no experimental technique offers the possibility of directly determining the hydration contributions related to interlayer cations and layer surfaces, an approach based on the combination of electrostatic calculations and immersion data is developed here, as already validated in the case of <b>montmorillonites</b> saturated by alkaline cations. This methodology allows to estimate the hydration energy for divalent interlayer cations and therefore to shed a new light on the driving force for hydration process occurring in <b>montmorillonites</b> saturated with alkaline-earth cations. Firstly, the surface energy values obtained from the electrostatic calculations based on the Electronegativity Equalization Method vary from 450 mJ m− 2 for Mg-montmorillonite to 1100 mJ m− 2 for Ba-montmorillonite. Secondly, considering both the hydration energy for cations and layer surfaces, the driving force for the hydration of alkaline-earth saturated <b>montmorillonites</b> can be attributed to the interlayer cation in the case of Mg-, Ca-, Sr-montmorillonites and to the interlayer surface in the case of Ba-montmorillonites. These results explain the differences in behaviour upon water adsorption as a function of the nature of the interlayer cation, thereby allowing the macroscopic swelling trends to be better understood. The knowledge of hydration processes occurring in homoionic <b>montmorillonites</b> saturated with both the alkaline and the alkaline-earth cations may be of great importance to explain the behaviour of natural clay samples where mixtures of the two types of interlayer cation are present and also provides valuable information on the cation exchange occurring in the swelling clays...|$|R
