Drawing on change management research and self-determination theory, a research model is developed. Data collected from a longitudinal field survey before, during, and after an enterprise-wide IS implementation are analyzed to test the proposed hypotheses. The results indicate that <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> can be used to increase readiness for change and end-user computing satisfaction during and after the implementation. Readiness for change positively impacts satisfaction during an implementation but not after. Contrary to the literature, No significant relationship exists between resistance to change and satisfaction.

The ultimate objective is development of intelligent model objects that include modeled object data and behavior description, and human intent filtered knowledge. The proposed model objects are intelligent organizers of information, knowledge, {{and procedures for}} decision assistance. Results facilitate completing present simple data, rule and formula based relating of parameters of modeled objects by an intelligent solution. The paper details application of integrated model object for description of an interrelated group of modeled objects. Description of engineering objects is introduced. Following this, essential <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> of modeled objects is shown. Next communication {{of changes in the}} affect zone of changed objects, is detailed. Finally, implementation of the proposed methodology as an extension of shape centered modeling of products and concept of the extended modeling systems are discussed as implementation issues...|$|E
