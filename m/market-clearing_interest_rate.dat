40|$|This paper {{provides}} a general methodology for introducing capital accumulation into economies with private information and heterogeneous agents. The agents operate a stochastic neoclassical production technology with capital and labor input. I study a moral hazard economy with unobservable input (hidden action). I characterize the efficient allocation of capital, labor, and consumption in a stationary recursive competitive equilibrium. The economy is decentralized by the component planner approach developed by Atkeson and Lucas (1995). Accumulation of capital is facilitated by a "capital planner" {{who serves as}} a financial intermediary for the component planners. In the unique, feasible and non-degenerate stationary equilibrium, private information lowers the <b>market-clearing</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> below agents' discount rate. ...|$|E
40|$|If {{we are to}} take {{mainstream}} economists {{at their}} word about finance, {{there would not be}} much to worry about. Their treatment of finance, a three-pronged approach, shows its presence to be uniformly beneficial. The first dimension of that neo-classical approach is to treat finance as just another sector and bring an industrial-organization approach to the analysis of its structure and behavior. (1) This analytical dimension focuses on the nature of financial services, the technology of their delivery, synergies (e. g. economies of scope in universal banking), and asymmetric information issues. Much of that approach stresses the dynamic nature of banks or other financial-services providers and the dilemmas of their risk-return trade-offs. The second approach in the mainstream analysis of finance, presented early on in path-breaking fashion by Gurley & Shaw (1960), stresses the beneficial impact of financial intermediation. Long recognized as making a crucial contribution to macro-economic equilibrium by mobilizing savings for investments and equating the two through a <b>market-clearing</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> the Gurley-Shaw approach stresses the mutually feeding relationship between financial development and economic growth. In this vision finance, rooted in savings, makes a positive contribution to our economy’s balanced-growth path. Finally, mainstream economists have recently focused on the behavioral characteristics of financial markets, formulating in the so-called efficient-market hypothesis a benign view of these markets as informationally efficient, inclined to find appropriate values, and inherently self-balancing. (2) This view mirrors what neo-classicals typically think of markets, except that the value here is a matter of claims on someone else’s future cash flows...|$|E
40|$|Central banks {{no longer}} set the {{short-term}} interest rates that they use for monetary policy purposes by manipulating the supply of banking system reserves, as in conventional economics textbooks; this process normally involves little or no variation in the supply of central bank liabilities. In effect, the announcement effect has displaced the liquidity effect as the fulcrum of monetary policy implementation. The chapter begins with an exposition of the traditional view of the implementation of monetary policy, and {{an assessment of the}} relationship between the quantity of reserves, appropriately defined, and the level of {{short-term interest rates}}. Event studies show no relationship between the two for the United States, the Euro-system, or Japan. Structural estimates of banks' reserve demand, at a frequency corresponding to the required reserve maintenance period, show no interest elasticity for the U. S. or the Euro-system (but some elasticity for Japan). The chapter next develops a model of the overnight interest rate setting process incorporating several key features of current monetary policy practice, including in particular reserve averaging procedures and a commitment, either explicit or implicit, by the central bank to lend or absorb reserves in response to differences between the policy interest rate and the corresponding target. A key implication is that if reserve demand depends on the difference between current and expected future interest rates, but not on the current level per se, then the central bank can alter the <b>market-clearing</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> with no change in reserve supply. This implication is borne out in structural estimates of daily reserve demand and supply in the U. S. : expected future interest rates shift banks' reserve demand, while changes in the interest rate target are associated with no discernable change in reserve supply. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the implementation of monetary policy during the recent financial crisis, and the conditions under which the interest rate and the size of the central bank's balance sheet could function as two independent policy instruments.

40|$|A {{monetary}} economy comprises a {{vast array}} of <b>market-clearing</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Central banks exert a direct influence over only a narrow subset of these rates: the rate at which they supply marginal funds to the commercial banking system. Accordingly, the market <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> which impinge upon real activity are typically distinct form - though not independent of - the official <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> This paper develops a formal model of the interactions between the central bank, commercial banks and the non-bank private sector. This model is then used to analyse the relationship between the official <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and 'other' market rates. Some illustrative evidence on the extent of the imperfection in the UK authorities' <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> control is also considered. Two policy conclusions emerge. First the authorities must understand the nature of the feed-through of official <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> into market rates when deciding on the appropriate level of the monetary instrument. Second, the possibility that <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> may not all move perfectly in line, implies that policy-makers and commentators alike need to be conscious of this plurality of <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> when assessing the overall tightness or looseness of monetary conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis studies {{risk of the}} multi-period market portfolio, both {{instantaneous}}ly {{and over}} time, using an equilibrium-based approach. For instantaneous properties, we first show that the representative investor‟s problem of maximizing the expected utility of lifetime consumption, aka Merton‟s problem, is equivalent to a generalized mean-variance optimization problem, which has both expected return and “covariance” constraints, where “covariance” {{is that of the}} optimal portfolio‟s return with changes in future investment opportunities. As the solution to this problem, the market portfolio is characterized by a multi-dimensional “mean-covariance surface”, which generalizes the classic, single-period, two-dimensional “mean-variance efficient frontier”. In addition to well-known preference-dependent (e. g. logarithmic preferences) conditions, we identify preference-independent conditions that are necessary and sufficient for the market portfolio to be mean-variance efficient. We also demonstrate that these conditions are unlikely to be satisfied in reality. We further explore a number of insightful decompositions of the market portfolio. For time series properties, we study equilibrium-consistent return processes of the market portfolio, both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, Bick (1990), and He & Leland (1993) (HL) provided necessary and sufficient conditions for the market portfolio‟s diffusion return processes to be consistent with preference-driven equilibria. We consider a similar problem but allow endogenous, <b>market-clearing,</b> instantaneously riskless <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> We are thus able to support a larger family of equilibrium consistent specifications of mean and volatility structures of the market portfolio‟s rates of return. When <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are deterministic, our conditions become those of HL. We also discuss how to implement these conditions in practical applications. Empirically, we introduce an implementation method of the equilibrium conditions, and implement them by modeling the market portfolio‟s return volatility, which is central to financial risk management. We analyze two families of equilibrium-based volatility structures, one represented by current popular models, and another in which we propose new models. In an empirical study, our proposed models, while as easy to implement, outperform the popular ones, in three out-of-sample forecast evaluations of different time periods, by standard predictability criteria. This is true especially during high-volatility periods, whether markets rise or fall...|$|R
