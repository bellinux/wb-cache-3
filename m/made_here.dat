5|$|In 1835, František {{retired to}} {{a farm in}} the {{south-eastern}} region of Bohemia. There being no suitable local school, Smetana {{was sent to the}} gymnasium at Jihlava, where he was homesick and unable to study. He then transferred to the Premonstratensian school at Německý Brod, where he was happier and made good progress. Among the friends he <b>made</b> <b>here</b> was the future Czech revolutionary poet Karel Havlíček, whose departure for Prague in 1838 may have influenced Smetana's own desire to experience life in the capital. The following year, with František's approval, he enrolled at Prague's Academic Grammar School under Josef Jungmann, a distinguished poet and linguist who was a leading figure in the movement for Czech national revival.|$|E

25|$|Water {{supplies}} are adequate {{to meet the}} demands of all sectors; however, the {{supplies are}} not located close to where most of the population lives. This has created inconsistent delivery of water to the citizens and has fostered new efforts at improving the water delivery systems of Jamaica. Other challenges include the lack of clear communication and effective coordination between the relevant water management institutions, however, efforts are being <b>made</b> <b>here</b> as well to improve on this deficiency.|$|E
25|$|San Francisco del Rincón {{has had a}} {{tradition}} of making hats since the 18th century.

About sixty percent of the municipality’s population of 110,000 is involved in some way in the craft, with about 2,000 directly making fireworks and the rest involved in frame building, supplies, distribution and more. The fireworks <b>made</b> <b>here</b> {{and other parts of the}} State of Mexico such as Almoloya de Juárez, Texcoco, Aculco and Zumpango, support 40,000 families directly or indirectly. Tultepec alone accounts for about almost half of all fireworks production in Mexico.|$|E

25|$|One {{best known}} Lake Patzcuaro artisan {{community}} is Santa Clara del Cobre, where 82% {{of the population}} is employed in the making of hand hammered copper items. There are 250 registered workshops in and around the town, which process about 450 tons of copper each year, generating an income of about fifty million pesos. Many of the copper items made are of a utilitarian nature – cooking utensils, various types of containers, pots, pans, plates, shot glasses, clocks, jewelry, vases, beds, tables, chairs, light switches, counters, sinks, even bathtubs, and much, much more, all in copper. However, since the 1970s copper jewelry, and many other non-essential items has also been <b>made</b> <b>here.</b> The workshops here are family-owned with children learning the trade from their parents. There is also a cooperative school-workshop to teach copper smithing, named Vasco de Quiroga.|$|E
25|$|The {{bar jack}} is of minor to {{intermediate}} importance to fisheries through its range; both commercially and to recreational fishermen. Archaeological evidence from San Salvador Island in the Bahamas demonstrates this species {{has long been}} targeted by humans for food, with the native Indians of the region often taking the bar jack for consumption, although it was of lesser importance than reef fishes such as parrotfishes and groupers. Modern fisheries take considerable quantities of the fish, but it rarely makes {{up the bulk of}} the catch. Catch statistics are not available for most countries. The United States reports only a small catch of between 0 and 15 tonnes per year, but with the abundance of the species in the Caribbean, larger catches are <b>made</b> <b>here.</b> The bar jack is somewhat shy of baited hooks and is therefore taken predominantly by trawls and seines. It is marketed fresh in the Antilles and Bahamas, with its edibility rated fair to very good.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{vineyards}} of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia {{are located in}} the southern half of the region, including the large wine regions of Collio Goriziano, Colli Orientali del Friuli, Isonzo and Carso. The Lison-Pramaggiore region is shared with the Veneto. Smaller regions such as the Annia, Aquileia, Grave and Latisana {{are located in the}} central and western part of the region around the city of Pordenone. These smaller regions are located on alluvial plains with soils composed of gravel and sand. The wines <b>made</b> <b>here</b> are lighter and less elegant than the Friuli wines made in the major southern wine regions. Unlike other Friuli regions which require 100%, a varietal wine in the Graves and Aquileia zones only need 85% of the grape variety with the Latisana and Annia zones requiring 90%. More red wine is produced in these zones than {{in the rest of the}} Friuli with Merlot, Cabernet franc and Cabernet Sauvignon being the leading varietals. With wine production still, frizzante and spumante styles are produced from Chardonnay, Pinot bianco, Pinot grigio, Friulano and Verduzzo.|$|E
