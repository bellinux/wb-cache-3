40|$|Most of the {{literature}} on Tunisian food demand measures the influence of traditional variables such as income and prices, or some socio-demographic variables. However, nowadays other important factors determine the consumer's final choice, among which are: the nutritious quality, the nutrient content of food and the increasing concern about health. The objective of this paper is twofold. On one hand, the paper aims to analyse the effect of previous factors on <b>meat</b> <b>consumer</b> behaviour. On the other hand, to the author's knowledge, this may well {{be one of the first}} studies that use data to answer the previous questions in the case of Tunisia. The nutritious quality of meat is measured by an index that relates nutrient content of each product with the standards suggested by the National Academy of Science. To cope with the second objective a demand system has been specified and estimated and nutrient elasticities have been obtained.

In this overview, the evidence regarding meat consumption {{and the risk of}} diabetes, both type 1 diabetes (T 1 DM) and T 2 DM and their macro- and microvascular complications, is reviewed. For T 2 DM, we performed a new meta-analysis including publications up to October 2012. For T 1 DM, only a few {{studies have reported}} increased risks for <b>meat</b> <b>consumers</b> or for high intake of saturated fatty acids and nitrates and nitrites. For T 2 DM, CHD, and stroke, the evidence is strongest. Per 100 g of total meat, the pooled relative risk (RR) for T 2 DM is 1. 15 (95 % CI 1. 07 – 1. 24), for (unprocessed) red meat 1. 13 (95 % CI 1. 03 – 1. 23), and for poultry 1. 04 (95 % CI 0. 99 – 1. 33); per 50 g of processed meat, the pooled RR is 1. 32 (95 % CI 1. 19 – 1. 48).

The purpose of the paper is, first, to evaluate if meat information is used during food purchase. Second, focusing on specific meat information, we assess the interest of consumer for some mandatory and voluntary information cues and identify the determinants affecting the use of them. Data were collected by a survey conducted in the Lombardy, region of the northern Italy, and employed a telephone questionnaire. The sample is composed by 1, 025 consumers. We estimate 4 models based on the literature and for all the equations we used a binary logit model. The analyses revealed that meat label is widely used by Italian consumers in the formulation of their purchasing preferences. The use of the meat label is also positively connected to consumer attention towards quality signaling such as certification, expiry date and so on. The origin is confirmed to be an important information for a large part of interviewed.

Prevalence of Pb shot ingestion was determined, as were Pb concentrations in liver and muscle tissue to evaluate the potential for Pb exposure in game <b>meat</b> <b>consumers.</b> Hunted birds with only embedded Pb shot (no steel) declined from 26. 9 % in 2007 – 08 to < 2 % over the following three hunting seasons after ban reinforcement. Pb shot ingestion in mallards decreased from a pre-ban value of 30. 2 % to 15. 5 % in the post-ban period. Liver Pb levels were predominantly defined by the presence of ingested shot, whereas muscle levels were defined by the presence of both ingested and embedded shot. Only 2. 5 % of mallard muscle tissue had Pb levels above European Union regulations for meat (0. 1 μg/g wet weight) in the 2008 – 09 season, when Pb shot ingestion prevalence was also at a minimum (5. 1 %).

40|$|Projects were {{conducted}} to determine effects of diet and aging periods on inherent beef flavor characteristics by relating biochemical constituents of <b>meat,</b> <b>consumer</b> acceptability, and lexicon flavor notes of two different muscles. Prediction equations were also created. Warm-season grasses caused increased concentrations of moisture, heme iron, and zinc in L. dorsi steaks. Aging 28 d instead of 7 d caused increased pH, carbohydrate, and heme and non-heme iron concentrations in B. femoris steaks. Warm-season grasses caused decreased concentrations in a majority of fatty acids, specifically when supplementation was not provided. Few differences were observed with cool-season grasses. Provision of wet distillers grains with solubles (WDGS) as a supplemental energy source minimized a majority of effects. Aging longer than 7 d tended to dissipate desirability differences in both muscles. Finishing on WDGS, especially after supplementing with WDGS, caused declines in several consumer panel scores in L. dorsi steaks. Warm-season grasses were most detrimental towards consumer panel scores in B. femoris steaks. The least desirable flavor notes were associated with warm-season grasses {{most of which were}} improved with supplementation in both muscles. Clearly, grass type is important for both flavor development and consumer preference. Even though several of the meat principle components were found to significantly influence consumer panel and lexicon flavor note scores, the regression coefficients were small. Several regression coefficients between lexicon notes and consumer panel scores were not only significant, but also large suggesting they may be good predictors of consumer acceptability. A majority of the lexicon flavor notes were shown to be altered by diet and aging. Grazing on cool-season grasses, or supplementing while being grazed on warm-season grasses, can alter flavor notes to create a product that is highly desirable to consumers. Providing supplementation, finishing on an all corn diet, and aging the meat also promoted desirable flavors. ^ Keywords: Aging, beef, diet, flavor, forages, supplementation...|$|E
40|$|Consumer {{attitudes and}} {{behaviour}} towards meat products were studied {{as a basis}} for meat product development. <b>Meat</b> <b>consumer</b> studies have traditionally taken two distinctive approaches. Economists have tended to use demand analysis, concentrating on the effects of price, income, and family structure on the consumption of 'beef' or 'lamb' or other aggregated commodity. Market researchers have tended to concentrate on consumer requirements and attitudes, frequently ignoring price and income. The present study examined <b>meat</b> <b>consumer</b> behaviour from both perspectives and made a detailed study of some of the techniques using 15 meats and 41 meat cuts. In consumer preferences, the use of a Semi-structured Linear Scale with the most-preferred and least-preferred meats anchored {{at either end of the}} scale and the remaining meats arranged along the scale at distances that reflected the consumers' preferences was equally effective at determining interval scale distances between meats as the traditional methods of measuring preferences, the Thurstone Case V Interval Scale. Also for Multidimensional Scaling, substitutability measurements were the most appropriate data measurements as the resulting solutions were stable, whilst the preference solutions tended to degenerate into unidimensional solutions. The study also showed that less predictable solutions resulted from MDS if substitutability measurements were made on meat cuts rather than at a species level. Fenker's and Krusdal et al. 's methods produced very similar ideal point solutions which were slightly different to solutions from a newly-developed method. The latter had the advantage of being able to identify the dimension most sensitive to changes in preference and to indicate whether an ideal point or vector model was the most appropriate method of determining new product opportunities in an MDS space. Factor Analysis showed that it was possible to identify three main Factors underlying consumers' attitudes to meat in general. They included; a 'meat quality on buying' Factor; a 'meat quality on eating' Factor and a 'meat quality on cooking and serving' Factor. However, the study showed that the structure of the Factors changed depending on whether attitudes to meat in general, to specific cuts from each species of meat, or individual cuts of meat were being examined. The use of Q-Factor Analysis to categorise meats on the basis of consumer attitudes showed that it was possible to categorise meats into 9 Hypothetical Product groupings based on the consumers' attitudes to the products. The groupings were shown to be based on the similarity of the attitude profiles of the cuts, cuts with similar profiles being grouped in the same Hypothetical Product. Three quantitative regression models were developed for 41 meat cuts. The models showed that the situation was not quite as complex as other studies had indicated. Per capita consumption of meat was shown to depend on the price, preference and prestige ratings of a meat cut, i. e. a typical demand model. The model accounted for 61 % of the variance in the dependent variable, substantially higher than other studies. Meat cut preference was shown to depend on the acceptability of the flavour, juiciness and presence of bone in the cut. The model typified a Fishbein/Rosenberg attitude model and accounted for 91 % of the variance in the dependent variable. The proportion of households buying model accounted for over 93 % of the variance in the dependent variable and typified a demand model. All the predictor variables in the model were consumer attitudes. The model indicated that the proportion of households that would purchase a cut was dependent on the tenderness, value for money and perceived price of a cut. The models indicated what had to be done to improve existing meat products and the areas that should be concentrated on for successful new meat product development...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide guidance to the setting of innovative strategies for the effective exploitation of high quality food products. These strategies should be capable to respond to the new needs of consumers through the integration of environmental, social and territorial aspects of quality.

Subsequently, through deep interviews to producers and retailers further details have been collected and evaluated. Moreover, a survey on 180 consumers residents in the Provinces of Naples, Avellino and Benevento, responsible of food shopping, has been performed with the aim of obtaining useful information to implement effective marketing strategies. Data were subjected to exploratory analysis, to provide a generic profile of the water buffalo <b>meat</b> <b>consumer,</b> and subsequently to cluster analysis to create homogeneous groups of consumers and identify the segments most interested to the product. Three different clusters were recognized: the first cluster (60 % of respondents), was characterized by consumers that have never tried the product and are also completely uninformed on its properties and characteristics; the second cluster (14 % of respondents) includes aware consumers, i. e. those who show a greater knowledge of the product and a higher frequency of consumption; the third cluster (26 % of respondents) groups the occasional users, i. e. those who bought water buffalo meat only once or very sporadically and who define themselves as poorly informed on the product. Results highlight the need to activate effective communication strategies to foster the perception of the actual quality of the product, emphasizing its nutritional properties and health benefits in order to retain the occasional consumers and promoting its sensory characteristics to attract new consumers. ...|$|E

With regard to mandatory meat labelling, the most important information was considered to be the country of animal origin, in accordance with other empirical studies. With regard to voluntary information, some, like the system of cattle breeding and cattle feeding, seems to be of interest to the Italian consumer. The empirical analysis suggests two different consumer types. The consumers who declare they use meat labels tend to be young people, of female gender, with a low income, and who use the media as their principal source of information. These consumers could {{have a lot of time}} available for food purchasing and probably the possibility of reading most of the information reported on the food label, even if they do not have the capacity to process all the information. On the other hand, those consumers who read specific labelled information tend to have a good level of food knowledge or education and weight problems. This second type of consumer probably does not have much time for food purchasing and they select only that information in which they are mostly interested. Moreover, the analysis reveals that consumers tend to read only information that is quickly understood, and that can help them to evaluate the quality of meat products. traceability, <b>meat,</b> <b>consumer</b> preferences, logit analysis, Agribusiness, Agricultural and Food Policy, Farm Management, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Food Security and Poverty, Industrial Organization,...|$|E
40|$|Livestock {{industries}} are significantly affected {{by changes in}} consumer behaviour. In order to add value to meat and livestock production, many firms and farms are supporting {{the development of new}} products – these products can differ by credence attribute, by degree of processing and by marketing strategies. The literature suggests {{that one of the most}} important determinants of success in product innovation is an understanding of the market the product is introduced into. In this report consumer preferences for meat products, by animal species including minor meats, and by type of processing are examined. Responses to economic variables such as price, advertising and income are identified as are responses to food safety and meat related health issues. Interesting results include the fact that income elasticities of demand for meat products purchased at grocery stores are negative in this study and that own and cross price elasticities for certain meats, across processing levels for example, show strong substitutions. Thus introducing new meat products may not result in increased sales by animal species but may only result in substitution of one meat type product for another product of the same meat type. Successful new product introductions or changes in product quality are shown, in this report, to be accompanied by significant marketing/advertising investment and, either by design or by serendipity, to have credence attributes in line with consumer's changing concerns. An example of this is the response in branded chicken sales, at the time of BSE in Canada, for a brand that could advertise itself as being 100 % grain fed. Marketing strategies, such as working with the Health Check™ program of the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada are shown to have an impact on firm level sales (as well as on sales at the individual product level), a halo effect, that may be of importance in the firm's development of other value-added products. Significant heterogeneity exists in consumer behaviour and it is important to recognize this heterogeneity in the development of value-added meat products. Added to the consumer heterogeneity, in general, is the heterogeneity in responses by meat type. What works for one sector, such as poultry, could be problematic in other sectors given differences in economic interrelationships reported in this study. <b>meat,</b> <b>consumer</b> behavior, value-added, strategic behaviour, Consumer/Household Economics, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Livestock Production/Industries, Marketing, D 12, Q 18,...|$|E
40|$|The millennial {{generation}} now outnumbers other {{generations and}} {{it is important to understand}} their drivers of meat consumption. In this study, beef, pork and chicken flavor attributes were created by using beef Top Choice strip loin steaks, beef Select outside round flat roasts, boneless pork loins, pork inside ham roasts, chicken breasts, and chicken thighs cooked to 58. 3 ?C, 62. 7 ?C or 80 ?C utilizing a food-service grill or Crock-pot?. Trained descriptive sensory attribute panel, central location test (CLT), in-home test (HUT) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry olfactory (GC-MS-O) were utilized to determine flavor. Raw meat fatty acid composition, non heme iron and myoglobin content, pH and fat and moisture were determined. Millennials (ages 18 to 34) or non-millennials (ages greater than 34) and were selected to be either light (eat beef 2 to 4 times per month) or heavy beef eaters (eat beef 3 or more times per week). Cooking method, cut, and internal temperature impacted meat descriptive flavor and texture attributes. The Crock-pot?-cooked meat had less positive flavor attributes than the grill-cooked <b>meat.</b> <b>Consumer</b> group did not affect how consumers rated grill flavor, juiciness and tenderness. Light beef eaters rated overall, flavor, and species flavor lower than heavy beef eaters. Consumers liked beef regardless of generational segment or their consumption of beef. Millennials versus non-millennials did not differ in response to flavor of beef indicating that other factors drive consumption other than palatability factors. Regression equations for beef, pork, chicken identity, brown/roasted, bloody/serumy, fat-like, metallic, liver-like, and umami accounted for 53, 64, 63, 42, 48, 46, 54, 56, and 46 percent of the variability, respectively using volatile aromatic compounds as independent variables. Overall flavor, tenderness, meat flavor, grill flavor, and juiciness liking accounted for 84 percent of the variation in overall consumer liking. Through interviews, consumers indicated that flavor was important to them when eating meat but price was the most important factor when purchasing beef. The HUT reported millennials tended to not like the raw appearance at the same level as non-millennials. Millennial light beef eaters tended to rate some attributes lower, but this was seen across the four meat cuts. Consumers rated liking for the HUT higher than the CLT. In conclusion, millennial light and heavy beef eaters responded the same to flavor as non-millennial light and heavy beef eaters...|$|E

The study aimed to {{understand}} predictors of consumers 2 ̆ 7 purchase intention towards processed meat based functional foods (i. e. enriched processed meat). A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 486 processed <b>meat</b> <b>consumers</b> in spring 2016. Results showed that processed meats were perceived differently in healthiness, with sausage-type products perceived less healthy than cured <b>meat</b> products. <b>Consumers</b> were in general more uncertain than positive about enriched processed meat but differences existed {{in terms of the}} attitudes and purchase intention. Following regression analysis, consumers 2 ̆ 7 purchase intention towards enriched processed meat was primarily driven by their attitudes towards the product concept. Perceived healthiness of existing products and eating frequency of processed meat were also positively associated with the purchase intention. Other factors such as general food choice motives, socio-demographic characteristics, consumer health and the consumption of functional foods and dietary supplements in general, were not significant predictors of the purchase intention for enriched processed meat...|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} {{environmental}} factors, including toxins, are also under active investigation {{as they may}} play a role in the disease's cause. Harmane or harmaline has been implicated not only in essential tremors, but is also found in greater quantities in the brain fluid of Parkinson's disease sufferers as well as cancer. Higher levels of the neurotoxin are associated with greater severity of the tremors. Exposure is primarily found from meat consumption of beef, pork, and especially chicken, even when cooked. Indeed, the greatest <b>meat</b> <b>consumers</b> were significantly more likely to have essential tremor. Harmaline's high lipid solubility enables accumulation in the brain tissue upon consumption from these environmental sources.|$|R
