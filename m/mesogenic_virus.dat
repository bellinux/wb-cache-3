40|$|Newcastle {{disease is}} an avian {{pathogen}} causing severe economic losses to the Indian poultry industry due to recurring outbreaks in vaccinated and unvaccinated flocks. India being an endemic country, advocates vaccination against the virus using lentogenic and mesogenic strains. Two virus strains which {{are commonly used}} for vaccination are strain F (a lentogenic virus) and strain R 2 B (a <b>mesogenic</b> <b>virus).</b> Strain F is given to 0 - 7 days old chicks and R 2 B is given to older birds which are around 6 - 8 weeks old. To understand the genetic makeup of these two strains, a complete genome study and phylogenetic analysis of the F, HN genes of these vaccine strains were carried out. Both the viral strains had a genome length of 15, 186 nucleotides and consisted of six genes with conserved complimentary 3 ' leader and 5 ' trailer regions. The fusion protein cleavage site of strain F is GGRQGRL and strain R 2 B is RRQKRF. Although both the viral strains had different virulence attributes, {{the length of the}} HN protein was similar with 577 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis of F, HN and complete genome sequences grouped these two strains in genotype II category which are considered as early genotypes and corroborated with their years of isolation...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} pigeon variant of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolated from backyard poultry using classical and molecular methods. In standard hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test both polyclonal NDV antiserum and monoclonal antibodies 161 / 617 specific for pigeon variants of NDV showed inhibition of heamagglutination of the isolated virus. Intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) has shown that the isolate is <b>mesogenic</b> <b>virus</b> (ICPI = 0. 81). One-step RT-qPCR for detection of M gene was performed indicating a presence of NDV and RT-qPCR for discrimination between lentogenic and velogenic strains based on F gene was also performed indicating a presence of virulent NDV. A portion of the F gene was amplified and sequenced for determination of virulence and phylogenetic characterization. The F protein cleavage site sequence of the isolate had multiple basic amino acids at residues 112 – 116 and a phenyl alanine at residue 117 (112 RRQKR*F 117) which is typical for velogenic strains. The nucleotide sequence of 374 bp was aligned to begin at nt 47 and finish at 420 immediately after the cleavage site and compared with other reference strains from the region and worldwide. In the phylogenetic tree, the isolate clustered into genotype VIb, typical for PPMV- 1. This strain is phylogenetically very similar to other PPMV- 1 isolated from pigeons in Macedonia. Poultry infected with PPMV- 1 can spread the virus in the absence of clinical signs, thus PPMV- 1 ’s are constant threat to domestic poultry. This is the first report of evidenced spillover of PPMV- 1 into poultry in Macedonia...|$|E
40|$|Mesogenic vaccine {{strains of}} Newcastle disease virus (NDV) {{are widely used}} in many {{countries}} of Asia and Africa to control the Newcastle disease of poultry. In India, the mesogenic strain R 2 B was introduced in 1945; it protects adult chickens that have been preimmunized with a lentogenic vaccine virus and provides long-lasting immunity. In this article, we report the complete genome sequence of the hitherto unsequenced Indian vaccine virus strain R 2 B. The viral genome is 15, 186 nucleotides in length and contains the polybasic amino acid motif in the fusion protein cleavage site, indicating that this vaccine strain has evolved from a virulent virus. Phylogenetic analysis of this <b>mesogenic</b> vaccine <b>virus</b> classified it with the viruses belonging to genotype III of the class cluster II of NDV. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a highly contagious and fataldisease-causing virus that affects most species of birds world-wide (5, 6). The genome of the virus, which is approximately 15 kb in size, is of negative polarity and nonsegmented in nature. The virus encodes six main structural proteins, namely, nucleocapsid (NP), phosphoprotein (P),matrix (M), fusion (F), hemagglutinin (HN), and large (L) proteins. Both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines {{have been developed to}} controlNDV infections. The vac-cine strain R 2 B used in the Indian subcontinent has given excel...|$|R
40|$|Strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), {{which were}} good or poor {{inducers}} of interferon i chick cells, occurred in all virulence groups of this <b>virus.</b> <b>Mesogenic</b> and velogenic strains which killed the embryo rapidly were better interferon inducers in embryonated gg {{than were the}} lentogenic strains. Identical and low sensitivities to interferon were shown by an interferon-inducing vaccine strain and a non-inducing and highly virulent strain. Measurements made when various strains were used to infect either normal or interferon-pre-treated cellsshowed {{that the absence of}} interferon production was not due to the inhibitory effect of virus infection on cellular protein synthesis. It is suggested that infective NDV synthe-sizes two kinds of inhibitory protein during infection. One of these inhibits the synthesis of the interferon protein and in consequence the majority of strains do not induce interferon i chick cells. The second protein is induced mainly by mesogenic and velogenic strains and may be responsible for inhibiting cellular protein synthesis...|$|R
