50|$|Dubonnet {{suspension}} was {{a system}} of trailing arm independent front suspension and steering popular mainly in the 1930s and 1940s. Not very durable unless exactingly maintained, it was soon replaced by other versions. It consisted of a rigidly <b>mounted</b> <b>axle</b> beam in which the sprung steering and suspension arms pivoted around kingpins mounted {{on the ends of}} the axle. The wheels themselves were mounted onto stub axles, suspended from the kingpins. The system featured an encased coil spring and shock absorber, which sealed in the oil needed to lubricate and protect the suspension parts. This was also the weakness of the layout, as any leaks would have negative effects on ride and durability.|$|E

Tyto metody jsou vhodné zejména pro řízení pohonů nízkopodlažních tramvají. V příspěvku jsou podány informace o specifikách jízdy kolejového vozidla s nezávisle otáčivými koly v kolejové dráze, o očekávaných přínosech synchronizovaného řízení a o konstrukci speciálního vozidla, na kterém je připravován experimentální výzkum v této oblasti. The biggest part of now {{manufactured}} tram-cars {{is realized}} as a low-floor vehicles. It is very pleasant for passengers, but it brings many difficulties for technical construction {{of such a}} this tramcars. The biggest problem is construction of bogies - it is common, that in the height of classical shaft is the floor, {{so it is not}} possible to use classical <b>mounted</b> <b>axle</b> and it is necessary to use free wheels. The characteristics of classical <b>mounted</b> <b>axle</b> in the rail is quite well known for many years, nor the the characteristics of free wheels, so there is lot of space for research, and more - there is lot of space, how to use features of free wheels, that should be better in the curves, than features of <b>mounted</b> <b>axle.</b> This - and the fact, that Skoda Transportation now manufactures tram-cars type 15 T called ForCity, that are using free-wheels driven by low speed gear-less PMSM - let us to start research project with cooperation with Skoda Electric a VUKV. The project is focused on optimization of control algorithms for upper control system for such a this vehicles. The project has three steps. The first step is simulation of free-wheel driven tram-car in the rail and developement of control algorithms on this simulation. The second step is project and construction of special narrow-track experimental rail car, that would be used for experiments and verification of the algorithms. The last step should be implementation of developed algorithms to control systems of real tram. The experimental rail car is projected as a accumulator powered vehicle with four free wheels driven by four gear-less PMSM suplied from four voltage inverters. These inverters are controled in current, velocity and torque loop by DSPs. The upper control system is realized by National Instruments Compact RIO system, which was chosen because of its good mechanical construction and possibility of graphical programming. Now, there is finishing the construction of the experimetal vehicle and laboratory developement of the algorithms, in a few weeks we are going to start the experimets with the experimetal rail-car at the Mladejov industry railway, so the developed algorithms could be used in 2014 at real tram 15 T.

40|$|The present {{scenario}} of freight applications in Europe {{is characterized by}} a trend towards rolling stock renewal and a new approach to periodical inspection and maintenance; this is a consequence of some evidences coming from service and showing potential inconsistency in general safety levels. A specific NDT technique, based on more than 40 years of service experience on passenger wheel-sets inspection, is here proposed for periodical NDT on freight wheel-sets. The ultrasonic testing technique is based on a rotating probe-holder to be applied at the ends of the <b>mounted</b> <b>axle</b> and able to inspect its critical sections with different angled probes. To inspect such critical sections such as press fits and geometrical transitions, the testing device {{is characterized by a}} set of ultrasonic transducers emitting longitudinal waves at a typical nominal frequency of 4 MHz and at different angles into the axle. The structural integrity of the wheel-set is then based, together with other factors, on the determination of the Probability of Detection (POD) curve of the rotating probe. An experimental campaign to derive the POD curve can be costly and time consuming, especially considering the determination of its confidence range. For this reason, in the present research, a Model-Assisted POD (MAPOD) approach was considered. Initially, different sets of artificial defects, obtained by EDM, were introduced on the external surface of three solid axles made of A 1 N steel grade. All the defects were then inspected by a rotating probe, with the aim to derive their response, considering 4 MHz and 2. 25 MHz transducers. The effect of the different time of flight characterizing the defects located at the different sections of the axles was, instead, determined by suitable numerical simulations carried out using the CIVAnde dedicated software package. Combining experimental and numerical results allowed to derive the MAPOD curve for the considered rotating probe with less effort with respect to the traditional experimental approach and to optimize the set-up of the rotating probe itself. As a result, the MAPOD curves of the rotating probe device are compared to the POD of standard UT inspection from axle end and a simulation of the reliability of inspection intervals is presented...|$|E
