40|$|<b>Magnesium</b> <b>is</b> a {{chemical}} element with the atomic number 12, an atomic weight of 24, {{and the common}} oxidation number 12. <b>Magnesium</b> <b>is</b> an alkaline metal and the eighth most abundant element in the Earth’s crust, where it constitutes about 2 % by mass, and ninth in the Universe. <b>Magnesium</b> <b>is</b> easily built up in supernova stars by the se-quential addition of three helium nuclei to carbon.

50|$|An adult has 22-26 {{grams of}} magnesium, with 60% in the skeleton, 39% {{intracellular}} (20% in skeletal muscle), and 1% extracellular. Serum levels are typically 0.7-1.0 mmol/L or 1.8-2.4 mEq/L. Serum <b>magnesium</b> levels may <b>be</b> normal even when intracellular <b>magnesium</b> <b>is</b> deficient. The mechanisms {{for maintaining the}} magnesium level in the serum are varying gastrointestinal absorption and renal excretion. Intracellular <b>magnesium</b> <b>is</b> correlated with intracellular potassium. Increased magnesium lowers calcium and can either prevent hypercalcemia or cause hypocalcemia depending on the initial level. Both low and high protein intake conditions inhibit magnesium absorption, as does the amount of phosphate, phytate, and fat in the gut. Unabsorbed dietary <b>magnesium</b> <b>is</b> excreted in feces; absorbed <b>magnesium</b> <b>is</b> excreted in urine and sweat.|$|R

50|$|<b>Magnesium</b> alloys <b>are</b> {{mixtures}} of <b>magnesium</b> with other metals (called an alloy), often aluminum, zinc, manganese, silicon, copper, rare earths and zirconium. <b>Magnesium</b> <b>is</b> the lightest structural metal. Magnesium alloys have a hexagonal lattice structure, which affects the fundamental properties of these alloys.

40|$|<b>Magnesium</b> <b>is</b> {{needed for}} more than 300 {{biochemical}} reactions in the body.

There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. ” 1 The federal government recommends that adult men consume 420 mg of magnesium a day, but admits that many Americans do not obtain this amount. 1 <b>Magnesium</b> <b>is</b> a very low-cost dietary supplement.

50|$|However, pure <b>{{magnesium}}</b> wheels <b>are</b> {{no longer}} produced, being found only on classic cars. Pure magnesium suffers from many problems.

40|$|<b>Magnesium</b> <b>is</b> an {{essential}} intracellular cation. Nearly 99 % of thetotal body <b>magnesium</b> <b>is</b> located in bone or the intracellularspace. <b>Magnesium</b> <b>is</b> a critical cation and cofactor in numerous intracellular processes. It is a cofactor for adenosine triphosphate; an important membrane stabilizing agent; {{required for the}} structural integrity of numerous intracellular proteins and nucleic acids; a substrate or cofac-tor for important enzymes such as adenosine triphosphatase, guanosine triphosphatase, phospholipase C, adenylate cyclase, and guanylate cyclase; a required cofactor for the activity of over 300 other enzymes; a regulator of ion channels; an important intracellular signaling molecule; and a modulator of oxidative phosphorylation. Finally, <b>magnesium</b> <b>is</b> intimately involved in nerve conduction, muscle contraction, potassium transport, and calcium channels. Because turnover of <b>magnesium</b> in bone <b>is</b> so low, the short-term body requirements are met by a balance of gastrointestinal absorption and renal excretion.
