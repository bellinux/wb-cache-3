In the literature, two main 3 D <b>machining</b> <b>variation</b> models have been studied: the stream of variation model, oriented to product quality improvement (fault diagnosis, process planning evaluation and selection, etc.), and {{the model of the}} manufactured part, oriented to product and manufacturing design activities (manufacturing and product tolerance analysis and synthesis).

40|$|Microsystem and {{integrated}} circuitry components are mostly manufactured using semiconductor technologies. Fabrication using high strength metals, for demanding aerospace, mechanical, or biomedical applications, requires novel technologies which {{are different from}} those for silicon. A promising mass production method for micro/meso scale components is electrochemical micromachining. The complex system, however, requires high precision mechanical fixtures and sophisticated instrumentation for proper process control. This study presents an electrochemical micromachining system with a closed-loop feedback control programmed using a conditional binary logic approach. The closed-loop control is realized using electrical current as the dynamic feedback signal. The control system improves material removal rate by 250 % through optimizing inter electrode gap and provides robust automation reducing <b>machining</b> <b>variation</b> by 88 %. The new system evokes production of higher quality microcomponents. Workpiece damage is reduced by 97 % and increased feature sharpness is observed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe high {{precision}} requirements of complex mechanical product (CMP) results in that its processing often contains multiple stages. When part was processed and transmitted in multiple stages, dimensional variation of part will be accumulated, coupling and transformed as well. Since the {{high precision}} {{requirements of the}} CMP, there are more process parameters impacted the machining errors than general multistage process, and more diverse process parameters {{should be considered in}} CMP's processing. To describe <b>machining</b> <b>variation</b> propagation process accurately and effectively, the variation propagation model for CMP processing was proposed. Firstly, the parts and fixtures in CMP processing are described by differential motion vector based on the robot's kinematics principle, and the change of theirs space pose are obtained by homogeneous transformation. Then, the fixture-induced variation, datum-induced variation, machining-induced variation and cutting-tool wear induced variation are analyzed and derived. The machining-induced variation is the dimension deviation produced by cutting force impacting on part's machining surfaces, and the cutting-tool wear induced variation is mainly caused by tool's normal wear. Lastly, the coupling relationship of datum-induced variation, fixture-induced variation, machining-induced variation and cutting-tool wear induced variation of each process stage is described, and the state space model of variation propagation is developed. The relationship of dimensional variation from all work stages and all kinds of variations is explored. By a real case study, feasibility and effectiveness of the model is validated. The model has great potential to be applied in the fault diagnosis, root cause identification of variation, sensor placement optimization, variation simulation, machining parameter and fixture design and optimization in quality control and improvement of complex product...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Excavation of shallow tunnels such as subways {{in urban}} areas plays a {{significant}} role as a life line and investigation of the soil behavior against tunnel construction is one of the vital subjects studied in the geotechnical scope. Nowadays, urban tunnels are mostly drilled by T. B. Ms and changing the applied forces to tunnel lining {{is one of the most}} risky matters while drilling tunnels by these <b>machines.</b> <b>Variation</b> of soil cementation can change the behavior of these forces in the tunnel lining. Therefore, this article is designed to assess the impact of tunnel excavation in different soils and several amounts of cementation on applied loads to tunnel lining under static and dynamic loads. According to the obtained results, changing the cementation of soil will affect the applied loadings to the tunnel envelope significantly. It can be determined that axial force in tunnel lining decreases considerably when soil cementation increases. Also, bending moment and shear force in tunnel lining decreases as the soil cementation increases and causes bending and shear behavior of the segments to improve. Based on the dynamic analyses, as cohesion factor in soil increases, bending moment, axial and shear forces of segments decrease but lining behavior of the tunnel is the same as static state. The results show that decreasing the overburden applied to lining caused by cementation is different in two static and dynamic states...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Rotary planing and moulding machining operations {{have been widely used}} within the woodworking industry for many years. As a result of these machining processes, the surface proftle of machined timber consists of cuttermarks which determine the product quality. However, the presence of <b>machine</b> system <b>variations</b> does not guarantee the quality requirements. Most of the rotary machining improvement techniques applied to obtain an improved product quality focus on conventional methods such as tooling and spindle system design. Tbe current state of the industry indicates that the design of rotary planing machines has probably reached its mechanical development limit, hence for an advanced machining process, mechatronics based improvement techniques are necessary. Therefore, the focus of this research work is directed towards the improvements on a mechatronics based small scale wood planer. Firstly, the effects of <b>machining</b> <b>variations</b> on the resultant surface form have been investigated. Especially, the effects of spindle vibrations and tooling inaccuracies on the surface ftnish have been analysed through simulation and further demonstrated through experimental work. With the introduced defect generation tool (DGT), the effect of a speciftc disturbance could be made to order, hence allowing generation of defects for quality investigations. This is not possible on existing machinery. Secondly, for an enhanced machining environment, surface proftle information is desirable. Various surface proftle measurement systems have been evaluated in terms of in-process deployment. Most of the evaluated measurement systems lack the measurement speed or exhibit other disadvantages which limit their implementation for real-time measurement purposes. Therefore, a novel in-process surface prof:tle monitoring system (ISMS) has been introduced that is capable of extracting surface proftle features in real-time. Thirdly, active vibration control has been implemented on the small scale planer. Unlike conventional design improvement methods, with the active vibration control approach the dynamic characteristics of the small scale planer were substantially improved, hence enabling a higher degree of freedom in terms of machining operation. This improvement allows machining operations beyond the limitations set by the mechanical properties of the planing system, thus enabling higher product quality where additional machining processes such as sanding could be obsolete...|$|R
