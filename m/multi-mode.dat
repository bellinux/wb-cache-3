5|$|The F-20's {{avionics}} suite was all-new {{and greatly}} improved over the earlier designs. The General Electric AN/APG-67 <b>multi-mode</b> radar was {{the heart of}} the sensor suite, offering a wide range of air-to-air and air-to-ground modes. The F-5's electro-mechanical navigation system was replaced with an all-electronic version based on a ring laser gyroscope. Time from power-on to being able to launch was greatly reduced as a result, to about 22 seconds, and Northrop boasted that the aircraft had the shortest scramble time of any contemporary aircraft. The cockpit of the F-5 was completely re-worked with a large head-up display (HUD) and two monochrome multi-function displays set high on the control panel, and the addition of a complete hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) control system. Many of the avionics promised to have reliability beyond that of any competing aircraft then in service.|$|E
25|$|Fiber with a core {{diameter}} less than about {{ten times the}} wavelength of the propagating light cannot be modeled using geometric optics. Instead, it must be analyzed as an electromagnetic structure, by solution of Maxwell's equations as reduced to the electromagnetic wave equation. The electromagnetic analysis may also be required to understand behaviors such as speckle that occur when coherent light propagates in <b>multi-mode</b> fiber. As an optical waveguide, the fiber supports one or more confined transverse modes by which light can propagate along the fiber. Fiber supporting only one mode is called single-mode or mono-mode fiber. The behavior of larger-core <b>multi-mode</b> fiber can also be modeled using the wave equation, which shows that such fiber supports more than one mode of propagation (hence the name). The results of such modeling of <b>multi-mode</b> fiber approximately agree with the predictions of geometric optics, if the fiber core {{is large enough to}} support more than a few modes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{explores the}} interrelationship between trip chain pattern and trip mode choice based on multinomial {{logistic}} model, using 2010 Nanjing resident trip survey data. Unlike previous literatures, trip mode choice {{is divided into}} single-mode and <b>multi-modes</b> in this study. Estimation coefficients verify trip chain pattern and trip mode selection are a pair of choices that influence each other. Trip mode is great positively associated with trip chain pattern of HW+WH, HO+OH, HW+OH, however, in return trip chain pattern {{is the most significant}} negative factor that affects trip mode choice, which means that no trip chain pattern would provoke travelers to select <b>multi-modes.</b> Despite the results seem to reach a contradiction between trip chain pattern and trip mode choice, still two facets of views try to explain the phenomenon, in addition, discussion on the interrelationship between complex trip chain pattern and <b>multi-modes</b> which might put forward more challenges to urban planning is also proposed as well in the paper...|$|R

This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with developing efficient numerical methods for acoustic wave scattering in random media which can be expressed as random perturbations of homogeneous media.

25|$|Fiber {{with large}} core {{diameter}} (greater than 10micrometers) may be analyzed by geometrical optics. Such fiber is called <b>multi-mode</b> fiber, from the electromagnetic analysis (see below). In a step-index <b>multi-mode</b> fiber, rays of light are guided along the fiber core by total internal reflection. Rays {{that meet the}} core-cladding boundary at a high angle (measured relative to a line normal to the boundary), greater than the critical angle for this boundary, are completely reflected. The critical angle (minimum angle for total internal reflection) {{is determined by the}} difference in index of refraction between the core and cladding materials. Rays that meet the boundary at a low angle are refracted from the core into the cladding, and do not convey light and hence information along the fiber. The critical angle determines the acceptance angle of the fiber, often reported as a numerical aperture. A high numerical aperture allows light to propagate down the fiber in rays both close to the axis and at various angles, allowing efficient coupling of light into the fiber. However, this high numerical aperture increases the amount of dispersion as rays at different angles have different path lengths and therefore take different times to traverse the fiber.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of {{single-mode}} fiber has a core diameter of 8–10 micrometers and is designed for use in the near infrared. The mode structure depends on the wavelength of the light used, so that this fiber actually supports a small number of additional modes at visible wavelengths. <b>Multi-mode</b> fiber, by comparison, is manufactured with core diameters as small as 50 micrometers and as large as hundreds of micrometers. The normalized frequency V for this fiber should be less than the first zero of the Bessel function J0 (approximately 2.405).|$|E
30|$|Handling of <b>multi-modes</b> and multi-constrained {{resources}} for each task requires complex queue management techniques. The software tool handles queues by selecting modes, instead of selecting and ranking tasks. For example, if a task mode requires {{three types of}} resources, then it can be started only {{when all of the}} resources are available. The system checks multi-skilled workers’ availability and <b>multi-modes</b> simultaneously. Each resource or a set of resources have their own set of rules, which are applied according to a priority order. These rules may be task-based, network-based, critical path-based, or resource-based priority rules. For example, if the priority rules for a given resource are: (1) customer deadline, (2) shortest processing time, (3) immediate successor, and (4) earliest completion time and if two modes of different tasks are in the queue requiring this resource, then priority rule 1 is used to resolve the conflict. If the tasks have the same customer deadline, then the second rule is applied and so on.|$|R

On single seat models, the forward cockpit area which normally houses a pilot is replaced by an electronics bay for avionics and onboard systems, including a fire control computer, <b>multi-mode</b> radar, laser rangefinder and forward-looking infrared (FLIR).

25|$|Extrinsic {{fiber optic}} sensors use an optical fiber cable, {{normally}} a <b>multi-mode</b> one, to transmit modulated light from either a non-fiber optical sensor—or an electronic sensor connected to an optical transmitter. A major benefit of extrinsic sensors is {{their ability to}} reach otherwise inaccessible places. An example is the measurement of temperature inside aircraft jet engines by using a fiber to transmit radiation into a radiation pyrometer outside the engine. Extrinsic sensors {{can be used in}} the same way to measure the internal temperature of electrical transformers, where the extreme electromagnetic fields present make other measurement techniques impossible. Extrinsic sensors measure vibration, rotation, displacement, velocity, acceleration, torque, and twisting. A solid state version of the gyroscope, using the interference of light, has been developed. The fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) has no moving parts, and exploits the Sagnac effect to detect mechanical rotation.|$|E

The onboard DMS is capable of automatically assessing the detection capabilities of identified threats and indicated targets.
