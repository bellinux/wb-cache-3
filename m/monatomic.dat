5|$|Helium is {{the second}} least {{reactive}} noble gas after neon, and thus the second least reactive of all elements. It is chemically inert and <b>monatomic</b> in all standard conditions. Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its thermal conductivity, specific heat, and sound speed in the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen. For these reasons and {{the small size of}} helium <b>monatomic</b> molecules, helium diffuses through solids at a rate three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|At a {{pressure}} of 55GPa (roughly 540,000 times atmospheric pressure) bromine undergoes an insulator-to-metal transition. At 75GPa it changes to a face-centered orthorhombic structure. At 100GPa it changes to a body centered orthorhombic <b>monatomic</b> form.|$|E
5|$|Characteristic {{and other}} {{properties}} of polyatomic nonmetals, diatomic nonmetals, and the <b>monatomic</b> noble gases {{are summarized in}} the following table. Physical properties are listed in loose order of ease of determination; chemical properties run from general to specific, and then to descriptive.|$|E
5|$|Helium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, <b>monatomic</b> gas, {{the first in}} the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements.|$|E
5|$|Neon is <b>monatomic,</b> {{making it}} {{lighter than the}} {{molecules}} of diatomic nitrogen and oxygen which form the bulk of Earth's atmosphere; a balloon filled with neon will rise in air, albeit more slowly than a helium balloon.|$|E
5|$|Helium (He) is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert <b>monatomic</b> {{chemical}} element that heads the noble gas {{series in the}} periodic table and whose atomic number is 2. Its boiling and melting points are the lowest among the elements and it exists only as a gas except in extreme conditions.|$|E
5|$|Six {{nonmetals}} occur naturally as <b>monatomic</b> noble gases: helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and {{the radioactive}} radon (Rn). They comprise {{a group of}} chemical elements with very similar properties. In their standard states they are all colorless, odourless, nonflammable gases with characteristically very low chemical reactivity.|$|E
5|$|As a halogen, {{astatine}} {{tends to}} be classified as a nonmetal. It has some marked metallic properties and is sometimes instead classified as either a metalloid or (less often) as a metal. Immediately following its production in 1940, early investigators considered it a metal. In 1949 {{it was called the}} most noble (difficult to reduce) nonmetal as well as being a relatively noble (difficult to oxidize) metal. In 1950 astatine was described as a halogen and (therefore) a reactive nonmetal. In 2013, on the basis of relativistic modelling, astatine was predicted to be a <b>monatomic</b> metal, with a face-centred cubic crystalline structure.|$|E
5|$|From left {{to right}} across the {{standard}} form of periodic table, as metallic character decreases, nonmetals therefore adopt structures that show a gradual reduction {{in the numbers of}} nearest neighbours—three or two for the polyatomic nonmetals, through one for the diatomic nonmetals, to zero for the <b>monatomic</b> noble gases. A similar pattern occurs more generally, {{at the level of the}} entire periodic table, in comparing metals and nonmetals. There is a transition from metallic bonding among the metals on the left of the table through to covalent or Van der Waals (electrostatic) bonding among the nonmetals on the right of the table. Metallic bonding tends to involve close-packed centrosymmetric structures with a high number of nearest neighbours. Post-transition metals and metalloids, sandwiched between the true metals and the nonmetals, tend to have more complex structures with an intermediate number of nearest neighbours. Nonmetallic bonding, towards the right of the table, features open-packed directional (or disordered) structures with fewer or zero nearest neighbours. As noted, this steady reduction in the number of nearest neighbours, as metallic character decreases and nonmetallic character increases, is mirrored among the nonmetals, the structures of which gradually change from polyatomic, to diatomic, to <b>monatomic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Helium is {{the least}} {{water-soluble}} <b>monatomic</b> gas, {{and one of the}} least water-soluble of any gas (CF4, SF6, and C4F8 have lower mole fraction solubilities: 0.3802, 0.4394, and 0.2372 x2/10−5, respectively, versus helium's 0.70797 x2/10−5), and helium's index of refraction is closer to unity than that of any other gas. Helium has a negative Joule–Thomson coefficient at normal ambient temperatures, meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand. Only below its Joule–Thomson inversion temperature (of about 32 to 50K at 1 atmosphere) does it cool upon free expansion. Once precooled below this temperature, helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen is a {{chemical}} element with symbol H and atomic number1. With a standard atomic weight of , hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its <b>monatomic</b> form (H) {{is the most}} abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars {{are mainly composed of}} hydrogen in the plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed protium (name rarely used, symbol 1H), has one proton and no neutrons.|$|E
5|$|In a {{flashback}} scene, Nico explores an old facility in Phoenix, {{where she is}} confronted by Spallaci's men, but is saved by Maynard. However, Maynard dies after he gets locked in the centrifuge, and Nico manages to escape by tricking Spallaci's men. Back in Rome, Nico informs George that the <b>monatomic</b> gold {{is being used to}} build a weapon called the Ark. They return to the monastery and witness Father Gregor shoot Gianelli; Nico is taken away and George is knocked out. When he awakens, the dying Gianelli hands over a manuscript in Latin, and tells him that the Ark's purpose is to use the <b>monatomic</b> gold to destroy the unbelievers. George goes to rescue Nico and meets Anna Maria in the catacombs, who tells him her side of the story and that the Ark needs a human interface to be activated. George arrives at the ceremony to see Nico chained to the Ark, ready to become the new Angel of Death. Mevlut, who is in fact ex-Turkish security and only pretended to be a waiter and priest, enters the scene armed with a gun, but Anna Maria points her gun at him as well. George succeeds in stopping the ceremony in time and frees Nico, but Anna Maria and Mevlut shoot each other and die.|$|E
5|$|Many {{properties}} of promethium rely on its position among lanthanides and are intermediate between those of neodymium and samarium. For example, the melting point, {{the first three}} ionization energies, and the hydration energy are greater than those of neodymium and {{lower than those of}} samarium; similarly, the estimate for the boiling point, ionic (Pm3+) radius, and standard heat of formation of <b>monatomic</b> gas are greater than those of samarium and less those of neodymium.|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gases}} (historically also the inert gases) {{make up a}} group of {{chemical}} elements with similar properties; under standard conditions, they are all odorless, colorless, <b>monatomic</b> gases with very low chemical reactivity. The six noble gases that occur naturally are helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and the radioactive radon (Rn). Oganesson (Og) is variously predicted to be a noble gas as well or to break the trend due to relativistic effects; its chemistry {{has not yet been}} investigated.|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gases}} are nearly ideal gases under {{standard}} conditions, but their {{deviations from the}} ideal gas law provided important clues {{for the study of}} intermolecular interactions. The Lennard-Jones potential, often used to model intermolecular interactions, was deduced in 1924 by John Lennard-Jones from experimental data on argon before the development of quantum mechanics provided the tools for understanding intermolecular forces from first principles. The theoretical analysis of these interactions became tractable because the noble gases are <b>monatomic</b> and the atoms spherical, which means that the interaction between the atoms is independent of direction, or isotropic.|$|E
5|$|John Dalton's {{original}} atomic hypothesis {{presumed that}} all elements were <b>monatomic</b> {{and that the}} atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton assumed that water's formula was HO, giving the atomic mass of oxygen was 8 times that of hydrogen, instead of the modern value of about 16. In 1805, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen; and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro {{had arrived at the}} correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called Avogadro's law and the diatomic elemental molecules in those gases.|$|E
5|$|Metal and {{nonmetals}} can {{be further}} classified into subcategories that show a gradation from metallic to non-metallic properties, when going left to right in the rows. The metals are subdivided into the highly reactive alkali metals, through the less reactive alkaline earth metals, lanthanides and actinides, via the archetypal transition metals, and ending in the physically and chemically weak post-transition metals. The nonmetals are simply subdivided into the polyatomic nonmetals, which, being nearest to the metalloids, show some incipient metallic character; the diatomic nonmetals, which are essentially nonmetallic; and the <b>monatomic</b> noble gases, which are nonmetallic and almost completely inert. Specialized groupings such as the refractory metals and the noble metals, which are subsets (in this example) of the transition metals, are also known and occasionally denoted.|$|E
5|$|Moving rightward {{across the}} {{standard}} {{form of the}} periodic table, nonmetals adopt structures that have progressively fewer nearest neighbours. Polyatomic nonmetals have structures with either three nearest neighbours, {{as is the case}} (for example) with carbon (in its standard state of graphite), or two nearest neighbours (for example) in the case of sulfur. Diatomic nonmetals, such as hydrogen, have one nearest neighbour, and the <b>monatomic</b> noble gases, such as helium, have none. This gradual fall in the number of nearest neighbours is associated with a reduction in metallic character and an increase in nonmetallic character. The distinction between the three categories of nonmetals, in terms of receding metallicity is not absolute. Boundary overlaps occur as outlying elements in each category show (or begin to show) less-distinct, hybrid-like or atypical properties.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} quantum effects to be {{explicitly}} noticed (but not understood at the time) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen, half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived. Maxwell observed that the specific heat capacity of H2 unaccountably departs {{from that of a}} diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a <b>monatomic</b> gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) rotational energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H2 because of its low mass. These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect.|$|E
5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of astatine {{are not known}} with any certainty. Many {{of them have been}} estimated based on the element's position on the periodic table as a heavier analog of iodine, {{and a member of the}} halogens (the group of elements including fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). Astatine is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a semiconductor or possibly a metal; it probably has a higher melting point than that of iodine. Chemically, several anionic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine. It also shows some metallic behavior, including being able to form a stable <b>monatomic</b> cation in aqueous solution (unlike the lighter halogens).|$|E
5|$|As is {{the case}} with the major {{categories}} of metals, metalloids and nonmetals, there is some variation and overlapping of properties within and across each category of nonmetal. Among the polyatomic nonmetals, carbon, phosphorus and selenium—which border the metalloids—begin to show some metallic character. Sulfur (which borders the diatomic nonmetals), is the least metallic of the polyatomic nonmetals but even here shows some discernible metal-like character (discussed below). Of the diatomic nonmetals, iodine is the most metallic. Its number of nearest neighbours is sometimes described as 1+2 hence it is almost a polyatomic nonmetal. Within the iodine molecule, significant electronic interactions occur with the two next nearest neighbours of each atom, and these interactions give rise, in bulk iodine, to a shiny appearance and semiconducting properties. Of the <b>monatomic</b> nonmetals, radon is the most metallic and begins to show some cationic behaviour, which is unusual for a nonmetal.|$|E
5|$|Oganesson is {{expected}} to have by far the broadest polarizability of all elements before it in the periodic table, almost double that of radon. By extrapolating from the other noble gases, it {{is expected}} that oganesson has a boiling point between 320 and 380 K. This {{is very different from the}} previously estimated values of 263K or 247 K. Even given the large uncertainties of the calculations, it seems highly unlikely that oganesson would be a gas under standard conditions, and as the liquid range of the other gases is very narrow, between 2 and 9 kelvins, this element should be solid at standard conditions. If oganesson forms a gas under standard conditions nevertheless, it would be one of the densest gaseous substances at standard conditions, even if it is <b>monatomic</b> like the other noble gases.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} of solid astatine is unknown. As an analogue of iodine {{it may have}} an orthorhombic crystalline structure composed of diatomic astatine molecules, and be a semiconductor (with a band gap of 0.7 eV). Alternatively, if condensed astatine forms a metallic phase, as has been predicted, it may have a <b>monatomic</b> face-centered cubic structure. Evidence for (or against) the existence of diatomic astatine (At2) is sparse and inconclusive. Some sources state {{that it does not}} exist, or at least has never been observed, while other sources assert or imply its existence. Despite this controversy, many properties of diatomic astatine have been predicted; for example, its bond length would be 300 ±10 pm, dissociation energy 83.7 ±12.5 kJ·mol−1,, Cl2, Br2, I2, and At2| url=http://theochem.chem.rug.nl/publications/PDF/ft279.pdf| journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics |volume=104 |issue=22|pages=9040–9046| doi=10.1063/1.471636|bibcode= 1996JChPh.104.9040V}} and heat of vaporization (∆Hvap) 54.39 kJ·mol−1. The latter figure means that astatine may (at least) be metallic in the liquid state on the basis that elements with a heat of vaporization greater than ~42 kJ·mol−1 are metallic when liquid; diatomic iodine, with a value of 41.71 kJ·mol−1, falls just short of the threshold figure.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{rigorous}} {{definition of}} a nonmetal. They show more variability in their properties than metals do. The following {{are some of the}} chief characteristics of nonmetals. Physically, they largely exist as <b>monatomic</b> gases, with a few having more substantial (but still open-packed) diatomic or polyatomic forms, unlike metals, which are nearly all solid and close-packed; if solid, they generally have a submetallic or dull appearance and are brittle, as opposed to metals, which are lustrous, ductile or malleable; they usually have lower densities than metals; are poor conductors of heat and electricity when compared to metals; and have significantly lower melting points and boiling points than those of metals (with the exception of carbon). Chemically, the nonmetals have relatively high ionisation energy and high electronegativity; they usually exist as anions or oxyanions in aqueous solution; generally form ionic or interstitial compounds when mixed with metals, unlike metals, which form alloys; and have acidic oxides whereas the common oxides of the metals are basic.|$|E
5|$|The 1s1 {{electron}} configuration of hydrogen, while superficially {{similar to that}} of the alkali metals (ns1), is unique because there is no 1p subshell. Hence it can lose an electron to form the hydron H+, or gain one to form the hydride ion H−. In the former case it resembles superficially the alkali metals; in the latter case, the halogens, but the differences due to the lack of a 1p subshell are important enough that neither group fits the properties of hydrogen well. Group 14 is also a good fit in terms of thermodynamic properties such as ionisation energy and electron affinity, but makes chemical nonsense because hydrogen cannot be tetravalent. Thus none of the three placements are entirely satisfactory, although group 1 is the most common placement (if one is chosen) because the hydron is by far the most important of all <b>monatomic</b> hydrogen species, being the foundation of acid-base chemistry. As an example of hydrogen's unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual {{electron configuration}} and small size, the hydrogen ion is very small (radius around 150fm compared to the 50–220pm size of most other atoms and ions) and so is nonexistent in condensed systems other than in association with other atoms or molecules. Indeed, transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of acid-base chemistry. Also unique is hydrogen's ability to form hydrogen bonds, which are an effect of charge-transfer, electrostatic, and electron correlative contributing phenomena. While analogous lithium bonds are also known, they are mostly electrostatic. Nevertheless, hydrogen can take on the same structural role as the alkali metals in some molecular crystals, and has a close relationship with the lightest alkali metals (especially lithium).|$|E
25|$|Sackur–Tetrode entropy – {{the entropy of}} a <b>monatomic</b> {{classical}} {{ideal gas}} determined via quantum considerations.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{specific}} {{heat of a}} <b>monatomic</b> gas is 3/2, {{this is the same}} as the thermodynamic formula for the entropy.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 the {{manuscript}} of Einstein on the quantum {{theory of the}} <b>monatomic</b> ideal gas (the Einstein-Bose condensation) was discovered in one of Leiden's libraries.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} heats of <b>monatomic</b> gases (e.g., helium) {{are nearly}} constant with temperature. Diatomic gases such as hydrogen display some temperature dependence, and triatomic gases (e.g., carbon dioxide) still more.|$|E
25|$|Thermodynamics often {{uses the}} concept of the ideal gas for {{teaching}} purposes, and as an approximation for working systems. The ideal gas is a gas of particles considered as point objects that interact only by elastic collisions and fill a volume such that their free mean path between collisions is much larger than their diameter. Such systems are approximated by the <b>monatomic</b> gases, helium and the other noble gases. Here the kinetic energy consists only of the translational energy of the individual atoms. <b>Monatomic</b> particles do not rotate or vibrate, and are not electronically excited to higher energies except at very high temperatures.|$|E
25|$|This {{gives the}} 9% difference, {{and would be}} a typical ratio for speeds of sound at room {{temperature}} in helium vs. deuterium, each with a molecular weight of 4. Sound travels faster in helium than deuterium because adiabatic compression heats helium more, since the helium molecules can store heat energy from compression only in translation, but not rotation. Thus helium molecules (<b>monatomic</b> molecules) travel faster in a sound wave and transmit sound faster. (Sound travels at about 70% of the mean molecular speed in gases; the figure is 75% in <b>monatomic</b> gases and 68% in diatomic gases).|$|E
25|$|In low {{molecular}} weight gases such as helium, sound propagates faster as compared to heavier gases such as xenon. For <b>monatomic</b> gases, {{the speed of sound}} is about 75% of the mean speed that the atoms move in that gas.|$|E
25|$|Crystallographic defects {{also affect}} the tube's {{electrical}} properties. A common result is lowered conductivity through the defective {{region of the}} tube. A defect in armchair-type tubes (which can conduct electricity) can cause the surrounding region to become semiconducting, and single <b>monatomic</b> vacancies induce magnetic properties.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{observations}} of the specific heat capacities of gases also raised concerns {{about the validity of}} the equipartition theorem. The theorem predicts that the molar heat capacity of simple <b>monatomic</b> gases should be roughly 3cal/(mol·K), whereas that of diatomic gases should be roughly 7cal/(mol·K). Experiments confirmed the former prediction, but found that molar heat capacities of diatomic gases were typically about 5cal/(mol·K), and fell to about 3cal/(mol·K) at very low temperatures. Maxwell noted in 1875 that the disagreement between experiment and the equipartition theorem was much worse than even these numbers suggest; since atoms have internal parts, heat energy should go into the motion of these internal parts, making the predicted specific heats of <b>monatomic</b> and diatomic gases much higher than 3cal/(mol·K) and 7cal/(mol·K), respectively.|$|E
25|$|An ion is an atom (or {{group of}} atoms) {{that has lost}} one or more electrons, giving it a net {{positive}} charge (cation), or that has gained one or more electrons, giving it a net negative charge (anion). <b>Monatomic</b> ions are formed from single atoms, while polyatomic ions are formed from two or more atoms that have been bonded together, in each case yielding an ion with a positive or negative net charge.|$|E
25|$|Defects due to both {{external}} and intrinsic factors may appear. External factors include the cleanliness of the substrate, method of preparation, and {{purity of the}} adsorbates. SAMs intrinsically form defects due to the thermodynamics of formation, e.g. thiol SAMs on gold typically exhibit etch pits (<b>monatomic</b> vacancy islands) likely due to extraction of adatoms from the substrate and formation of adatom-adsorbate moieties. Recently, {{a new type of}} fluorosurfactants have found that can form nearly perfect monolayer on gold substrate due to the increase of mobility of gold surface atoms.|$|E
