40|$|The {{research}} was conducted {{in order to understand}} views of academics on <b>ethical</b> responsibilities, <b>principles</b> and violations in academia. The {{research was}} carried out with 14 academics. Data were collected by using a structured interview form composed of five questions. Content validity, internal validity and external validity were checked for the validity of the research while external and internal reliability was checked to ensure the research reliability. Data were analyzed by using a qualitative method ‘content analysis'. The findings were presented under three sections: (a) <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> and violations in scientific research and publications, (b) <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> and violations in social relationships, and (c) <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> and violations in respect to social responsibility. As a result of the study, it was found that academics were aware of the <b>ethical</b> <b>principles.</b> In addition, given the example that they provided from their surroundings, it was discovered that <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> were being violated in scientific research and publication process as well as in social relationships in academia...|$|R

40|$|In {{interpersonal}} value conflicts <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> {{are employed}} to justify own actions. However, there is competition among <b>ethical</b> <b>principles.</b> Therefore {{the preference for}} a specific <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> may be merely a function both of personal values and of the value-laden situations in which actions are made. A German sample of 132 participants rated their agreement on ten justifications in seven experimentally constructed situations. The situations varied in their expression of values, organized by the value circle (Schwartz, 1992). The justifications assess five <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> (deontology, utilitarianism, partiality, hedonism, and intuitionism). Variance components of the agreement ratings were separated using GLM and plotted in the value circle. Preferences for <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> depended on both the value content of situations and the responder values. The Person x Situation interaction was not significant. The results illustrate the difficulties in gaining agreement on arguments among individuals with conflicting values...|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the implied <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> {{of the history of}} the manna in Exodus 16 and the {{relevance}} of these <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> for the contemporary culture of consumerism. The principles that can be derived from this history are the principle of labour and rest, of sharing, the <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> of responsible consumption, the protection of creation and of remembrance of God’s concern for humankind and creation. Modern consumerism with its underlying neo-liberal economic philosophy appears to violate these principles in many ways. The implied <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> of the manna history is thus highly relevant in the ethical discourse about economic planning,labour and rest, the environment and God’s involvement in the modern world...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I want to {{consider}} not only <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> in disasters, but the relationships between ethics in disasters and ethics in normal situations. To begin with, I define the concept of 'disaster', and make definite the meaning of 'in disaster'. In this paper, I use the period of 'in disaster' as {{the period of the}} impact of the disaster and of emergency phase. <b>Ethical</b> <b>principles</b> in that period are different from those of normal situations; however, as far as I know, I can find only a few papers that deal with the nature of <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> in disasters directly. Fortunately, there are a lot of literatures dealing with 'triage' from an ethical viewpoint. Therefore, I will take the approach of, first, examining the <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> in triage, and then, on the basis of it, considering the nature of <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> in disasters. Here, I stated several ethically important points; such as triage in medical settings is utilitarian but doesn't presuppose the good of the community; <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> in disasters are based on the primitive response to the requirement of self-preservation; in a disaster we are permitted to give priority to saving our life; at the base of ordinary ethics there is the factor of self-preservation; even in a disaster, ordinary <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> work secondarily; the situation of disaster is, in some aspects, similar to the state of nature or state of war in social contract theory...|$|R

Abstract The thesis "Confucian <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> {{in managing}} Asian companies" {{will present the}} <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> of Confucianism that affect the current management of Asian companies at Eastern Asia. The work will introduce with history of Confucianism, its influence on the culture in Asian countries and with some dominant elements, which over the centuries strengthen to certain ethical standards determinating the way of today's management of Chinese, Korean and partly Japanese companies. Many of these companies do operate in western countries with different cultural tradition based on Christianity. Presenting of some <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> in Asian management {{in the context of}} cultural traditions allows for deeper intercultural understanding.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, design science {{research}} (DSR) has re-emerged {{as an important}} research paradigm {{in the field of}} information systems. However, the approaches currently recommended for conducting design science research do not include an ethical component. Thus, the objective {{of this paper is to}} initiate a debate about the need for <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> for DSR in Information Systems (IS). To launch this debate, we suggest that a set of <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> for DSR in IS must be created. Although the interpretation and application of these principles might not always be straightforward, our argument is that all DSR practitioners in IS should devote at least some time to consider <b>ethical</b> <b>principles...</b>|$|R

The ethical code here is the unified international ethical code and standards for IS-professionals as proposed by Effy Oz (1992). An ethical code and standard is the rules for morally correct behavior that a community or organization put forth to its members, serving as norms and guidelines for their interactions and relationships. The underlying <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> are represented by such moral philosophers as Aristotle, Plato, Kant, Hegel, Hume, and Mill.

40|$|The Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) is an assets allocation, whose {{aim is to}} {{maximize}} not only the portfolio expected return but the benefits for a consumer who as a whole operates according to the <b>ethical</b> <b>principles.</b> The wealth of a market economy is to cross the different ethical identities of families, of enterprises, of banks, {{in order to improve}} the allocation of the resources for a sustainable development. In this paper, we aim at describing the portfolio selection realized {{on the basis of the}} <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> - positive /negative, inclusionary/exclusionary - of an investor. The first part of this paper describes Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) and ethical funds market in the world; the second part builds an ethical index as evaluation of the coherence of the <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> of the investor in comparison with the <b>ethical</b> <b>principles</b> respected in the investment. The paper also illustrates the set of admissible portfolios for an ethical investor, obtained on the basis of the following indexes - of risk, of expected return and of ethicality...|$|R
40|$|Although the Epicurean ethical {{system is}} {{fundamentally}} egoistic and hedonistic, it attributes a surprisingly significant role to friendship. Even so, I argue that traditional discussions of Epicurean friendship fail to adequately {{account for the}} value (or pleasure) of individual friends. In this thesis I present an amended notion of Epicurean friendship that better accounts {{for all of the}} pleasure friends afford. However, the success of my project requires rejecting an Epicurean <b>ethical</b> <b>principle.</b> Because of this, I explore textual evidence both in favor and against the amended notion I propose and the problematic <b>ethical</b> <b>principle.</b> After arguing against the problematic <b>ethical</b> <b>principle</b> and dispelling additional objections to my project, I conclude that Epicureans should endorse the amended notion of friendship I have developed...|$|R

The aim is to provide an ethical approach to health disparities research that simultaneously describes and seeks to eliminate health disparities...|$|R
