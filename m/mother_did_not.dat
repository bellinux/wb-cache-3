5|$|Parker {{was born}} in Norfolk, Virginia, to Carolyn Whitfield, a 17-year-old single mother. Although Parker's <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> marry his {{biological}} father, Parker {{had a relationship with}} his father until his father died from cancer when Parker was eleven. Parker's mother's first husband gave Parker his surname. After a divorce, Parker's mother then married her second husband, Walter Whitford, who was in the United States Air Force and was stationed in Bath, Maine. Parker has four younger sisters.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Michael Howell and Peter Ford {{published}} The True History of the Elephant Man, {{presenting the}} fruits of their detailed archival research. Howell and Ford brought to light a large amount of new information about Merrick. In addition to proving that his name was Joseph, not John, they were able to describe in more detail his life story. They refuted some of the inaccuracies in Treves's account, showing that Merrick's <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> abandon him, and that Merrick deliberately chose to exhibit himself to make a living.|$|E

5|$|On {{appeal to}} the Third Circuit, a three-judge panel of Judge Robert Cowen, Judge Morton Ira Greenberg and Judge Thomas I. Vanaskie {{unanimously}} held for the city. In a decision issued in 2015, Judge Vanaskie, writing for the Court, reiterated Judge McNulty's finding that Heffernan's actions in picking up the sign for his <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> constitute protected speech or association. He distinguished the case at hand from the Sixth Circuit's ruling in Dye by noting that in that case, the employers had inferred the employees' intent from their non-participation in partisan politics rather than an actual action they had taken, as had occurred in Heffernan's case.|$|E
5|$|By 1994, Copeland's {{mother had}} {{separated}} from Robert. After living with various friends and boyfriends, DelaCerna moved {{with all of}} her children into two small rooms at the Sunset Inn in Gardena, California. In early 1996, Cantine convinced Copeland to attend a ballet class at her local Boys & Girls Club. Cynthia Bradley, a friend of Cantine's, taught a free ballet class at the club once a week. Copeland attended several classes as a spectator before participating. DelaCerna allowed Copeland {{to go to the}} club after school until the workday ended. Bradley invited Copeland to attend class at her small local ballet school, San Pedro Dance Center. Copeland initially declined the offer, however, because her <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have a car, was working 12–14 hours a day, and her oldest sister Erica was working two jobs. Copeland began her ballet studies at the age of 13 at the San Pedro Dance Center when Cynthia Bradley began picking her up from school. After three months of study, Copeland was en pointe.|$|E
5|$|During Queen Victoria's widowhood, Edward {{pioneered the}} idea of royal public {{appearances}} as we understand them today—for example, opening the Thames Embankment in 1871, the Mersey Tunnel in 1886, and Tower Bridge in 1894—but his <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> allow Edward {{an active role in}} the running of the country until 1898. He was sent summaries of important government documents, but she refused to give him access to the originals. He annoyed his mother by siding with Denmark on the Schleswig-Holstein Question in 1864 (she was pro-German) and in the same year annoyed her again by making a special effort to meet Giuseppe Garibaldi. Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone sent him papers secretly. From 1886, Foreign Secretary Lord Rosebery sent him Foreign Office despatches, and from 1892 some Cabinet papers were opened to him.|$|E

5|$|One of the Wattle Birds, Anderson's {{seventh and}} final novel, was {{published}} in 1994. Set in Sydney, it details three days {{in the life of}} Cecily Ambruss. Although the novel is ostensibly set in the present, the final paragraph of the novel reveals that the three-day sequence has been devised by Cecily as a means of coping with the fact that a year earlier, her mother, Christine had died of breast cancer, while Cecily had been away on holiday. Throughout the novel, Cecily attempts to resolve two quandaries: she does not understand why her <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> tell her about that fatal illness and let her go overseas, refusing to let family members call her back, even for the funeral, nor why Christine included the cruel stipulation in her will that Cecily must marry before she can inherit. In addition to its adept depiction of the intricacies of social and family life, One of the Wattle Birds speaks to the process of writing and creating, as Cecily is herself a writer.|$|E

Later, Liz has a {{conversation}} with her mother Margaret Lemon (Anita Gillette) regarding Liz being single. During their conversation, Margaret reveals that her true love was Buzz Aldrin and not Liz's father Dick Lemon (Buck Henry), which shocks Liz. She tells Jack about what her mother has revealed to her and ponders why her <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> choose to be with Buzz. Jack offers to introduce her to Buzz with Liz accepting, and wanting {{to find out what}} her mother missed out on. During their meet, Buzz confesses {{that it was a good}} decision that Margaret did not stay with him as he spent many of his years as an alcoholic. After her encounter with Buzz, Liz tells her mother that she respects the decision she made by not ending up with Buzz.|$|E

Du Châtelet's mother, Gabrielle-Anne de Froulay, was brought up in a convent, at the time the predominant educational institution available to French girls and women. While some sources believe her <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> approve of her intelligent daughter, or of her husband's encouragement of Émilie's intellectual curiosity, there are also other indications that her mother not only approved of Du Châtelet's early education, but actually encouraged her to vigorously question stated fact.|$|E
25|$|John Enoch Powell {{was born}} in Stechford, Birmingham, on 16 June 1912. He lived there {{for the first six}} years of his life before his parents moved to Kings Norton in 1918, where he lived until 1930. He was the only child of Albert Enoch Powell (1872–1956), a primary school headmaster, and his wife, Ellen Mary (1886–1953). Ellen was the {{daughter}} of Henry Breese, a Liverpool policeman and his wife Eliza, who had given up her own teaching career after marrying. His <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> like his name, and as a child he was known as 'Jack'. At the age of three, Powell was nicknamed 'the Professor' because he used to stand on a chair and describe the stuffed birds his grandfather had shot, which were displayed in his parents' home.|$|E

According to some later accounts, she attended a masked ball in Brussels where she met the young Prince de Ligne, a young Belgian aristocrat, and had an affair with him. Other accounts say that they met in Paris, where the Prince came often to attend the theater. The affair was cut short when she learned that her mother had suffered a heart attack. She returned to Paris, where she found that her mother was better, but that she herself was pregnant from her affair with the Prince. She did not notify the Prince. Her <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want the fatherless child born under her roof, so she moved to a small apartment on rue Duphot, and on 22 December 1864, the 20-year-old actress gave birth to her only child, Maurice Bernhardt.|$|E
