5|$|Sihanouk, {{hearing of}} the turmoil, headed for Moscow and Beijing in order to demand that the patrons of PAVN and the Viet Cong exert <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> clients. On 18 March 1970, Lon Nol {{requested}} that the National Assembly vote {{on the future of}} the prince's leadership of the nation. Sihanouk was ousted from power by a vote of 92–0. Heng Cheng became president of the National Assembly, while Prime Minister Lon Nol was granted emergency powers. Sirik Matak retained his post as deputy prime minister. The new government emphasized that the transfer of power had been totally legal and constitutional and it received the recognition of most foreign governments. There have been, and continue to be, accusations that the U.S. government played some role in the overthrow of Sihanouk, but conclusive evidence has never been found to support them.|$|E
25|$|Locus {{of control}} becomes more {{internal}} with age. As children grow older, they gain skills which give them <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> environment. However, whether this or biological development {{is responsible for}} changes in locus is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Fractionation: Through {{the use of}} a {{fractionation}} column, different fractions distilled from {{a material}} can be selectively excluded to modify the scent of the final product. Although the product is more expensive, this is sometimes performed to remove unpleasant or undesirable scents of a material and affords the perfumer <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> composition process.|$|E
50|$|When {{the theory}} was refined over the years, Singer and Levine (1988) found mixed {{support for the}} theory in their early {{attempts}} to test this theory. While mothers were seen to be <b>more</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> daughters than their sons, the authors also found this to be more so with egalitarian than patriarchal families, which is a finding opposite to what power control theory would predict.|$|R
50|$|By {{converting}} existing computers {{into thin}} clients, an educational institution can also gain <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> how <b>their</b> students are using computing resources {{as all of}} the user sessions can be monitored on the server.

50|$|People within {{cultures}} {{that tend to}} use an impulsive orientation to understand and evaluate social situations are likely to feel <b>more</b> personal <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> expressions than people within institutional-oriented cultures, resulting in more of a buffer against strain and emotional exhaustion.|$|R
25|$|Ryun {{broke with}} the President over two major initiatives, No Child Left Behind and Medicare reform {{legislation}} {{that included a}} prescription drug benefit. In voting against No Child Left Behind, Ryun said he believed states should have <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> own education system. In opposing the Medicare bill, Ryun said the bill didn't provide enough reform to keep future costs from soaring.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, {{the sexual}} {{education}} {{perspective of the}} discourse of desire is very rare in U.S. high schools. This perspective encourages adolescents {{to learn more about}} their desires, gaining pleasure and feeling confident in their sexualities. Researchers state that this view would empower girls because it would place less emphasis on them as the victims and encourage them to have <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> sexuality.|$|E
25|$|Age {{plays an}} {{important}} role in one's internal and external locus of control. When comparing a young child and an older adult with their levels of locus of control in regards to health, the older person will have <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> attitude and approach to the situation. As people age they become aware of the fact that events outside of their own control happen and that other individuals can have control of their health outcomes.|$|E

50|$|According to Julian Tanner, {{he offers}} two {{interesting}} critical comments. Though the power control theory effectively explains common delinquency among ordinary youth, {{it does not}} explain violent and repetitive crime and, therefore, the power control theory cannot predict such behavior. In addition, the power control theory suggests that parents in egalitarian households {{are more likely to}} raise females as delinquent than a female growing up in a patriarchal family; however, UCR (uniform crime report) data shows that the opposite association exists and that the involvement in female labor force is actually related to lower levels of female delinquency. Also, after years of refining the power control theory, theorists have found the notion that mothers being <b>more</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> daughters are <b>more</b> likely to be found in egalitarian families than patriarchal families, which is the opposite relationship the power control theory would likely predict.|$|R
25|$|Throughout the transformation, President Freeland's oft-repeated {{goal was}} to crack the Top 100 of the U.S. News & World Report's rankings. With this {{accomplished}} by 2005 the transformation from commuting school to national research university was complete. Freeland stepped down on August 15, 2006 {{and was replaced by}} Dr. Joseph Aoun, a former dean at the University of Southern California. Aoun implemented a decentralized management model, giving university deans <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> budgets, faculty hiring decisions, and fundraising.|$|E
25|$|In the 1884 election, Tomoana was {{defeated}} by Wi Pere, {{and returned to his}} role as a chief and leader in the Hawke's Bay region. In 1886, with Renata Kawepo, he set up a meeting in Hastings to discuss the forthcoming Native Land Administration Bill with John Ballance, the native minister. As the first Māori spokesperson Tomoana reviewed past land legislation, concluding that all of it had brought harm to Māori, and asked that they be given <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> affairs. Ballance's Native Land Administration Act 1886 established block committees, but they were generally regarded with suspicion, partly because it was feared that the proceeds of the land would be swallowed up in the committees' costs.|$|E
25|$|Through the new Commonwealth Bank Act and the Banking Act 1945, {{the board}} was {{replaced}} by a six-member council, consisting of bank and treasury officials. It additionally formalised the bank's administrative powers of monetary and banking policy and exchange control and also stated the governor was responsible for managing the bank. Highly debated legislation in 1945 caused high amounts of regulation on private banks, which later-Governor H.C. Coombs was opposed to, along with his opposition to bank nationalisation in 1947. When he became governor in 1949, he allowed private banks to have <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> liquidity and attempted to introduce market-based monetary policy. He also warned of the possibility of stagflation in 1959.|$|E
50|$|After leaving Sony, {{the band}} {{began to work}} on their seventh studio album (in {{addition}} to various collaborations and side-projects). In a very short mid-2007 interview with Jamirotalk, drummer Derick McKenzie expressed his satisfaction with leaving Sony, saying that {{it was the beginning of}} a period in which the band will have <b>more</b> creative <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> own work, together with plenty of room for experimentation and lack of pressure from a record company.|$|R
40|$|In Taking Power Back: Putting People in Charge of Politics, Simon Parker {{argues for}} urgent {{reform of the}} UK’s {{centralised}} democracy. Tony Travers welcomes this book as a well-researched account that both outlines the historical decline of local government in the UK and proposes innovations through which citizens can gain <b>more</b> direct <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> own lives. However, public faith in the capacity to actually secure such empowering change remains a pressing question...|$|R
50|$|Until 2015 {{university}} autonomy was nonexistent. In 2015 the Ukrainian parliament {{passed a}} new law on higher education to give universities <b>more</b> autonomy, including <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> own finances. The aim was to encourage private investment, fundraising {{and the creation of}} endowments.|$|R
25|$|American International Pictures had {{achieved}} {{a great deal}} of commercial success in the early 1960s with Bava's Black Sunday (1960) and Black Sabbath (1963), as well as dozens of lesser Italian films, including several sword and sandal pictures. Eventually, AIP heads Samuel Z. Arkoff and James H. Nicholson decided to coproduce some of these films, rather than just pay for the rights to distribute them, in order to have <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> content. Planet of the Vampires was one such coproduction, financed by AIP and Italy's Fulvio Lucisano for Italian International Film, along with some Spanish production money provided by Castilla Cooperativa Cinematográfica. AIP provided the services of writer Ib Melchior, whose previous movies had included such modest hits as The Angry Red Planet (1959) and Reptilicus (1961), as well as the relatively big budget Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1964). Melchior wrote the screenplay for the English-language version of the film, with some assistance from AIP producer Louis M. Heyward.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} a study by Deborah Tolman and her colleagues {{indicated}} that adolescent exposure to sexuality on television in general does not directly affect their sexual behaviors, rather it {{is the type of}} message they view that has the most impact. Gender stereotypes enacted in sexual scenes on TV were seen to have a large affect on adolescents. Girls felt they had less control over their sexuality when they saw men objectifying women and not valuing commitment. The study discussed the risk of women internalizing this message and spreading the idea that it is okay to be weak and answer to men all the time. However, girls who saw women on TV who refuted men’s sexual advances usually felt more comfortable talking about their own sexual needs in their sexual experiences as well as standing up for themselves. They were comfortable setting sexual limits and therefore held <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> sexuality. Findings for boys were less clear; those who saw dominant and aggressive men actually had less sexual experiences.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 a study {{conducted}} by Angela Chu and Jin Nam Choi was published in the Journal of Social Psychology, in which they intended to understand task performance among procrastinators with the definition of procrastination as the absence of self-regulated performance, from the 1977 work of Ellis & Knaus. In their study they identified two types of procrastination: the traditional procrastination which they denote as passive, and active procrastination where the person finds enjoyment of a goal-oriented activity only under pressure. The study calls this active procrastination positive procrastination, as it is a functioning state in a self-handicapping environment. In addition, it was observed that active procrastinators have more realistic perceptions of time and perceive <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> time than passive procrastinators, which is considered a major differentiator between the two types. But surprisingly, active and passive procrastinators showed similar levels of academic performance. The population of the study was college students and the majority of the sample size were women and Asian in origin. Comparisons with chronic pathological procrastination traits were avoided.|$|E
40|$|On April 14, 2001, the Federal Health Privacy Rule, which grants {{patients}} {{greater access}} to their medical records and <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> how <b>their</b> personal health information is used, took effect. The Rule addresses, among other things, the obligations of health care providers to protect health information. The Rule, however, does not preempt stronger state laws governing the privacy of medical information. It is therefore extremely important to determine how each state is protecting health information held by health care providers...|$|R
2500|$|Big Bang's first {{extended}} play, Always (2007), marked several {{changes for}} the group. Though the members had previously involved themselves with writing and composing, the group took <b>more</b> creative <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> music, moving away from their hip-hop and R roots and towards electronic dance music. G-Dragon composed and wrote most of the tracks included in their first EP, including [...] "Lies."

5000|$|In 1970 the {{brothers}} opened their own studio at 916 19th Ave. South in Nashville, TN. The new studio, Glaser Sound, was {{often referred to}} as Hillbilly Central because it was a haven for artists who wanted to have <b>more</b> artistic <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> own music and careers. The studio included a publishing company, production company, talent agency, and design services for album covers. In that venue creative experimentation thrived [...] as new opportunities for songwriters and artists became commonplace.|$|R
500|$|Following Republican {{efforts to}} pass the Medicare Act of 2003, Bush signed the bill, which {{included}} major changes to the Medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits. The retired persons lobby group AARP worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement. Bush said the law, estimated to cost $400billion over the first ten years, would give the elderly [...] "better choices and <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> health care".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to this, multinational corporations {{are seen to}} advertise a homogenous image of ideal women across the country is argued to cause {{an increase in the}} commodification of women's bodies. This is also manifested in the form of nationalist pride exhibited through Indian women winning international beauty pageants. According to some feminists, such developments have offered women greater sexual autonomy and <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> bodies. [...] However, many other feminists feel that such commodification of female bodies has only served the purpose of feeding to male fantasies.|$|E
500|$|Though he {{had drifted}} through his life thus far, Milk found his vocation, {{according}} to journalist Frances FitzGerald, who {{called him a}} [...] "born politician". At first, his inexperience showed. He tried to do without money, support, or staff, and instead relied on his message of sound financial management, promoting individuals over large corporations and government. He supported the reorganization of supervisor elections from a citywide ballot to district ballots, which was intended to reduce the influence of money and give neighborhoods <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> representatives in city government. He also ran on a culturally liberal platform, opposing government interference in private sexual matters and favoring the legalization of marijuana. Milk's fiery, flamboyant speeches and savvy media skills earned him {{a significant amount of}} press during the 1973 election. He earned 16,900votes—sweeping the Castro District and other liberal neighborhoods and coming in 10th place out of 32candidates. Had the elections been reorganized to allow districts to elect their own supervisors, he would have won.|$|E

500|$|The label {{had also}} been known for {{carrying}} out the management concept of [...] "condominium". Originally conceived and penned by Cowell, it gave artists authority and responsibility over their recorded material independently, {{as well as the}} ability to assign the master tapes over to the label for distribution. Strata-East artists had <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> recordings than major labels at the time had offered. Music journalist Kevin Moist later wrote of the label's [...] "condominium" [...] concept, [...] "The idea was to try and develop an independent cultural space outside of the mainstream that could function self-sufficiently and be genuinely participatory for its members. The goal was to live in an engaged way where art, society, spirituality, and politics could all come together holistically in an integrated existence. That (sub)cultural renewal is embodied in the kind of music midwifed by Strata-East." [...] The label's philosophy for artist management and recording ethic worked to the advantage of artists such as Gil Scott-Heron and Brian Jackson. Scott-Heron and Jackson were able to release more aesthetically personalized recordings for Strata-East than most mainstream labels would allow.|$|E
500|$|Violence was {{a serious}} problem. Gangs like the Moyamensing Killers and the Blood Tubs {{controlled}} various neighborhoods. During the 1840s and early 1850s when volunteer fire companies, {{some of which were}} infiltrated by gangs, responded to a fire, fights with other fire companies often broke out. The lawlessness among fire companies virtually ended in 1853 and 1854 when the city took <b>more</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> <b>their</b> operations. during the 1840s and 50s violence was directed against immigrants by people who feared their competition for jobs and resented newcomers of different religions and ethnicity. Nativists often held mostly anti-Catholic, anti-Irish meetings. Violence against immigrants also occurred, the worst being the nativist riots in 1844. Violence against African Americans was also common during the 1830s, 40s, and 50s. Immigrants competed with them for jobs, and deadly race riots resulted in the burning of African-American homes and churches. In 1841, Joseph Sturge commented [...] "...there is probably no city in the known world where dislike, amounting to the hatred of the coloured population, prevails more than in the city of brotherly love!" [...] Several anti-slavery societies had been formed and free blacks, Quakers and other abolitionists operated safe houses associated with the Underground Railroad, but working class and ethnic whites opposed the abolitionist movement.|$|E
