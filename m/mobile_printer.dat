40|$|Abstract — Wireless Sensor {{networks}} are infrastructure-less and fully distributed systems of self-configurable and self-organized nodes that are wishing to share data over the air. Nodes could be PCs, <b>mobile</b> phones, <b>printers,</b> etc. The main challenge of sensor networks is its characteristics (dynamic topology, variable capacity, infrastructure less, bandwidth, computing power, battery lifetime, etc.). Another challenge is the deployment operation. In this paper {{we proposed a}} method of random deployment (algorithm) and simulation tool to simulate how these sensors work and find the solutions to increase their lifetime, and find the suitable method for deploying sensors in the targeted area (such as isolated area, military area, and in areas infested with terrorist) by using some algorithms that reduce the sensor energy. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Consumer {{electronics}} are pervasive. It {{is impossible}} to imagine a household or office without DVD players, digital cameras, <b>printers,</b> <b>mobile</b> phones, shavers, electrical toothbrushes, etc. All these devices operate at different voltage levels ranging from 1. 8 to 20 VDC, {{in the absence of}} universal standards. The voltages available are however usually 120 / 230 VAC at 50 / 60 Hz. This situation makes an individual electrical energy conversion system necessary for each device. Such converters usually involve several conversion stages and often operate with excessive losses and poor reliability. The aim of the project presented in this paper is to design and implement a multi-channel DC/DC converter system, customizing the output voltage and current ratings according to the requirements of the load. Distributed, multi-agent techniques will be applied for the control of the DC/DC converters. Keywords—DC/DC converter, energy efficiency, multi-agent control, parallel converters. I...|$|R

40|$|The 2009 Update of the Tipping Point report {{estimates}} {{that there are}} 234 million items of e-waste in or {{on their way to}} landfill. The Report shows that a recycling scheme for televisions and computers would create 2, 570 jobs nationally by the year 2015. This could be increased to 6, 190 new jobs if all electronic waste items were included. Environment Victoria Campaigner Fraser Brindley said that e-waste recycling made economic sense. “The government’s own figures show that a recycling scheme for televisions and computers would have a net economic benefit,” Mr Brindley said. “We’ve shown that this will translate into thousands of green collar jobs across the country. ” Mr Brindley also said that a recycling scheme for televisions and computers was a good start, but that the federal government should include all other e-waste in the future. “Televisions and computers are only 38 % of the e-waste going to landfill,” Mr Brindley said. “We also need to deal with the mountains of <b>mobile</b> phones, <b>printers,</b> games consoles, videos and stereo that are not being recycled. ” This 2009 Update follows the release of the consultation regulatory impact statement (RIS) for televisions and computers. This is a government process that will inform the 5 November 2009 meeting of the Environment Protection and Heritage Council (EPHC), at which Ministers have promised to announce a recycling scheme for televisions and computers.

40|$|The {{daily life}} of a common man {{revolves}} around various forms of appliances/gadgets he uses throughout the day such as a <b>mobile</b> phone, laptop, <b>printer,</b> microwave oven, washing machine, etc. Although these appliances/gadgets are taken {{by most of the}} people for granted, the problem occurs when any of these things do not work as they are expected to.

Although most of the companies which produce these appliances/gadgets do supply them with basic manuals, which deal with how to solve these minor issues, but reading them {{and at the same time}} repairing the corresponding appliance/gadget can be a frustrating task at times.

40|$|International audienceEnsuring {{traceability}} {{of field}} experimental data or laboratory sampling data to conduct reproducible research {{is a challenge}} at the present time. Between the time when geolocalized specimens (biotic or abiotic) are taken, and the time the resulting data ends up in analysis published within a study, many manual operations take place and may generate errors. The French LTSER have joined forces {{at the national level}} to propose a solution as generic as possible to this problem of monitoring of the samples and the data associated with them. Compared to existing solutions (such as Laboratory Information Management Systems), we target a robust labeling solution adapted to outdoor working conditions, with the management of stocks and movements of samples. We designed and realized a prototype tested from end to end, using an open source software ([URL] cheap Zebra <b>printers</b> (<b>mobile</b> or not) and raspberries as devices. This solution provides sufficient flexibility for the wide variety of existing protocols. Its strength is the record of all contextual data associated with the samples, which constitute important parameters of the subsequent analyzes.

40|$|Consumer {{electronics}} have {{revolutionized the}} manner in which we work, read, and entertain ourselves. However, this transformation comes at a high cost, with significant energy input and emissions releases across all stages of the electronic product life cycle. The limited success of per product efficiency improvements, often formulated in the field of industrial ecology, does not address the electronic product system as a whole because escalating consumption may actually offset any individual impact reductions. Additionally, existing industrial ecology models fail to effectively capture energy, material, and waste flows associated with real consumption patterns, as consumers purchase, use, and discard a group of interrelated devices such as desktops, laptops, <b>printers,</b> <b>mobile</b> phones, and digital cameras. To address this challenge, this dissertation develops and applies novel industrial ecology methodologies to more effectively characterize changes to rapidly evolving and interrelated product systems. Notably, these approaches borrow heavily from underutilized biological ecology concepts from community ecology and optimal foraging theory, but adapted for use as applied to a complex product system like consumer electronics. These approaches can lead to more effective design, production, green purchasing decisions, and end of life practices and policies, {{while at the same time}} expand industrial ecology 2 ̆ 7 s traditional focus on the ecosystem metaphor and ‘per product’ approaches and strengthen its connection to the source science: biological ecological roots...|$|R
