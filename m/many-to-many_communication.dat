50|$|IP {{multicast}} is {{a technique}} for one-to-many and <b>many-to-many</b> real-time <b>communication</b> over an IP infrastructure in a network. It scales to a larger receiver population by requiring neither prior knowledge of a receiver's identity nor prior knowledge {{of the number of}} receivers. Multicast uses network infrastructure efficiently by requiring the source to send a packet only once, even if it needs to be delivered to a large number of receivers. The nodes in the network (typically network switches and routers) take care of replicating the packet to reach multiple receivers such that messages are sent over each link of the network only once.|$|R

In a <b>many-to-many</b> group <b>communication</b> environment, sender authentication is also another important security requirement as each participant can potentially be both a sender and a receiver. In this study, we propose an authenticated group communication scheme which is secure against an adaptive chosen ciphertext attack using identity-based signcryption. The proposed scheme allows multiple senders to dynamically multicast messages into an arbitrary group of receivers determined by the senders. In the proposed scheme, the group member can be a stateless receiver. Data confidentiality of the group communication is guaranteed as well as the sender authentication...|$|R

50|$|Social {{control is}} the process through which social groups {{maintain}} and reinforce norms, values, and behaviors within a population. The mechanisms through which this control is exerted vary, from informal social pressure to formal laws and sanctions. Altheide has focused his research on how media logics often intersect with the mechanism of social control. For example, he investigated the 1991 release of the AZSCAM tapes. These tapes showed members of the Arizona State Legislature accepting bribes, and were released pre-trial to wide media circulation. Altheide concludes that the agents of social control (the authorities conducting the sting operation) were able to manipulate the media's need to show entertaining crime oriented news, and were therefore able to try the alleged corrupt officials {{in the court of}} public opinion prior to their appointed due process. In a more recent study, Altheid examined the role of surveillance in internet technology. Altheide argues that the internet's <b>many-to-many</b> <b>communication</b> structure predicates an awareness of surveillance by its users. This knowledge of surveillance has led internet users to accept as inevitable the lack of privacy online. This in turn has led to an acceptance of the invasive tactics used by agents of social control, namely law enforcement, in their prosecution of sexual predators and assumed terrorist threats.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Multicast is {{efficient}} way to distribute information from single source to multiple destination or <b>many-to-many</b> in <b>communication</b> networks. Mobile ad-hoc network needs special multicast routing protocol to adapt its characteristics including local broadcast capacity, arbitrary topology change, and bandwidth constraint and power limitation. A multicast routing protocol for MANET should find compromise between routing overhead and data transmission efficiency {{so that it can}} efficiently use bandwidth and power. For this aim, this paper proposes a new multicast routing protocol called Adaptive Core based Multicast Routing protocol (ACMP) which constructs and maintains a group-shared tree using adaptively selected core only when group traffic exists. ACMP attempts to react more quickly to broken tree edge by detecting link failures during data forwarding. Once a link failure is detected, this protocol uses local route recovery to establish a temporary route and periodical tree refreshing to maintain an optimal multicast tree. The performance of ACMP is evaluated via simulation...|$|R

40|$|The <b>many-to-many</b> social <b>communication</b> {{activity}} on the popular technology-news website Slashdot has been studied. We have concentrated on the dynamics of message production without considering semantic relations and have found regular temporal patterns in the reaction time {{of the community to}} a news-post as well as in single user behavior. The statistics of these activities follow log-normal distributions. Daily and weekly oscillatory cycles, which cause slight variations of this simple behavior, are identified. A superposition of two log-normal distributions can account for these variations. The findings are remarkable since the distribution of the number of comments per users, which is also analyzed, indicates a great amount of heterogeneity in the community.

40|$|Abstract—In a {{wireless}} network with multiple amplify-and-forward (AF) nodes, the many-to-many cooperative commu-nication is achieved {{through the novel}} concept of space-time network coding with optimal node selection (STNC-ONS). The communication under the STNC-ONS scheme is split into two phases: 1) the broadcasting phase (BP) in which each node in its allocated time-slot broadcasts its data symbol {{to all the other}} nodes in the network, and 2) the cooperation phase (CP) in which the optimal node corresponding to each desired data symbol is selected for relaying it to the destination node in its own time-slot. The optimal node selection is based on the maximum harmonic mean value of the source, intermediate, and destination nodes’ scaled instantaneous channel gains. An approximate symbol-error-rate (SER) expression for M-ary phase shift keying (M-PSK) modulation is derived along with an upper bound SER approximation which is shown to be asymptotic at high signal-to-noise ratio. The derived analytical expressions verify that for a network of N nodes, a full diversity order of (N − 1) per node is achieved by the STNC-ONS scheme. It is concluded that the STNC-ONC scheme is a potential <b>many-to-many</b> cooperative <b>communication</b> scheme with applications spanning sensor and mobile wireless networks.

40|$|Purpose: {{this paper}} aims to promote better {{understanding}} of how the internet is used as part of crisis communication. Design/methodology/approach: the internet may be changing the way PR operates in a crisis. It has been reported that the web has a significant role in disseminating information and that <b>many-to-many</b> online <b>communication</b> allows organisations to achieve “excellent” communication. However, it has also been suggested that in practice {{there is a need for}} more flexibility that the “excellence” model suggests. This study reports on data collected from in-depth interviews with ten senior PR-practitioners in order to understand their experiences and attitudes. Findings: a range of attitudes are identified, informed by recent experience. Although participants indicated knowledge of and preference for two-way communication with stakeholders, in practice they found this impractical or undesirable. This, their preference for existing approaches, and ignorance about the internet informed their views about online communication. The result was that some regarded the internet as inferior in terms of its ability to achieve “traditional” tasks and because of its potential for undesirable dialogue. When the web was acknowledged as useful it tended to be considered as supplementary to existing approaches. There was little recognition of the need for online dialogue.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach towards <b>many-to-many</b> (multipeer) <b>communication</b> across ATM networks that provides support for heterogenous receivers and senders. Applications that request such services are conferencing tools and distributed simulations. These applications {{are characterized by}} a group of participants that simultaneously act as recipients and sources of (real-time) information. Currently ATM networks provide no adequate support for heterogeneous multipeer communication. The concept presented in this paper is based on IP and RSVP. It aims at providing their services across ATM networks. The concept of active networking is applied since ATM switches provide dedicated multipeer services. In the Internet, IP multicast provides a mechanism based on group addresses identifying the members of a multicast group. The sources transmit to the group addresses without complete knowledge about the actual membership of the group. To provide quality-of-service (QoS), the Integrated Services model is introduced for the next generation internet. The receiver-oriented RSVP protocol is used for QoS signaling. In a first approach, a solution for an ATM-LAN model is considered. The ATM technology enables the creation of bidirectional one-to-one and unidirectional one-to-many connections with specified QoS. However, ATM-UNI signaling does not support many-to-many service. Any form of a multipeer communication service must be emulated. Additionally, the current ATM-UNI disallows changes of QoS of an established connection, i. e. dynamic QoS is not supported. 2 Related Wor...|$|R
