2500|$|A 2001 World Health Organization (WHO) {{report found}} that infant formula {{prepared}} in accordance with applicable Codex Alimentarius standards was a safe complementary food and a suitable breast <b>milk</b> <b>substitute.</b> In 2003, the WHO and UNICEF published their Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding, which restated that [...] "processed-food products for...young children should, when sold or otherwise distributed, meet applicable standards recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission", and also warned that [...] "lack of breastfeeding—and especially lack of exclusive breastfeeding during the first half-year of life—are important risk factors for infant and childhood morbidity and mortality". In particular, the use of infant formula in less economically developed countries is linked to poorer health outcomes because of the prevalence of unsanitary preparation conditions, including lack of clean water and lack of sanitizing equipment. UNICEF estimates that a formula-fed child living in unclean conditions is between 6 and 25 {{times more likely to}} die of diarrhea and four times more likely to die of pneumonia than a breastfed child. Rarely, use of powdered infant formula (PIF) has been associated with serious illness, and even death, due to infection with Cronobacter sakazakii and other microorganisms that can be introduced to PIF during its production. [...] Although C. sakazakii can cause illness in all age groups, infants are believed to be at greatest risk of infection. Between 1958 and 2006, there have been several dozen reported cases of E. sakazakii infection worldwide. The WHO believes that such infections are under-reported.|$|E

40|$|The {{market for}} plant-based dairy-type {{products}} is growing as consumers replace bovine milk in their diet, for medical reasons or as a lifestyle choice. A screening of 17 different commercial plant-based <b>milk</b> <b>substitutes</b> based on different cereals, nuts and legumes was performed, including {{the evaluation of}} physicochemical and glycaemic properties. Half of the analysed samples had low or no protein contents (< 0. 5 %). Only samples based on soya showed considerable high protein contents, matching the value of cow’s milk (3. 7 %). An in-vitro method was used to predict the glycaemic index. In general, the glycaemic index values ranged from 47 for bovine milk to 64 (almond-based) and up to 100 for rice-based samples. Most of the plant-based <b>milk</b> <b>substitutes</b> were highly unstable with separation rates up to 54. 39 %/h. This study demonstrated that nutritional and physicochemical properties of plant-based <b>milk</b> <b>substitutes</b> are strongly dependent on the plant source, processing and fortification. Most products showed low nutritional qualities. Therefore, consumer awareness is important when plant-based <b>milk</b> <b>substitutes</b> are used {{as an alternative to}} cow’s milk in the diet...|$|R

50|$|Lactose is {{the major}} sugar found in milk. Lactose {{intolerance}} occurs when an individual is deficient in the enzyme lactase; which breaks down the lactose in the intestine.

A variety of products are available which contain <b>milk</b> <b>substitutes,</b> so those foods are still able to be consumed by individuals with a lactose intolerance.
