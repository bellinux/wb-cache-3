5|$|Blood-C {{focuses on}} Saya Kisaragi, an {{outwardly}} normal girl {{who serves as}} the shrine maiden to a country town; in reality, she is a skilled swordswoman charged by her father to defeat Elder Bairns, monsters who feed on human blood. As her battles grow <b>more</b> <b>desperate</b> and more people she cares for fall victim to the Elder Bairns, Saya begins finding faults in her reality, and eventually uncovers a disturbing truth about herself, the town and her surviving friends.|$|E
5|$|Replacement {{pilots were}} pushed through an {{abbreviated}} training regimen {{in order to}} meet the short-term needs of the fleet. This led to a sharp decline in the quality of the aviators produced. These inexperienced pilots were fed into front-line units, while the veterans who remained after Midway and the Solomons campaign were forced to share an increased workload as conditions grew <b>more</b> <b>desperate,</b> with few being given a chance to rest in rear areas or in the home islands. As a result, Japanese naval air groups as a whole progressively deteriorated during the war while their American adversaries continued to improve.|$|E
5|$|In Oosterbeek, the {{situation}} was becoming <b>more</b> <b>desperate.</b> Hackett {{was wounded in the}} morning and had to give up the eastern command. The RAF attempted some close support around the perimeter which just held, but shelling and sniping increased casualties by the hour. The aid stations were home to some 2,000 men, both British and German as well as Dutch civilian casualties. Because many of them were actually in the front line in homes taken over earlier in the battle, the odd situation was created where casualties were evacuated forward rather than rearwards. Without evacuation, the wounded were often injured again and some posts changed hands between the British and Germans several times as the perimeter was fought over.|$|E

5|$|On March 29, Confederate {{president}} Jefferson Davis {{called on}} the Confederate Congress to pass a conscription bill. The bill would require a three-year term of service for all able-bodied white men {{between the ages of}} 18 and 35. At first, the bill was unpopular, but as the military situation grew <b>more</b> <b>desperate</b> for the Confederacy, both houses quickly passed it. Still, the measure caused some to question Davis' military decisions; among them was Burnett, usually one of Davis' staunchest allies. In an April 19, 1862 address to the legislature, Burnett denounced Davis' preference for those who were, like Davis himself, graduates of West Point. The speech drew such a vigorous positive response from the gallery that some of the most zealous had to be removed.|$|E
5|$|Riego's Revolt had two {{significant}} {{effects on the}} war in the Americas. Militarily, the large numbers of reinforcements, which were especially needed to retake New Granada and defend the Viceroyalty of Peru, would never arrive. Furthermore, as the royalists' situation became <b>more</b> <b>desperate</b> in region after region, the army experienced wholesale defections of units to the patriot side. Politically, the reinstitution of a liberal regime changed the terms under which the Spanish government sought to engage the insurgents. The new government naively assumed that the insurgents were fighting for Spanish liberalism and that the Spanish Constitution could still be the basis of reconciliation between the two sides. The government implemented the Constitution and held elections in the overseas provinces, just as in Spain. It also ordered military commanders to begin armistice negotiations with the insurgents with the promise that they could participate in the restored representative government.|$|E
5|$|Some {{say that}} nothing could be <b>more</b> <b>desperate</b> than the measure, but I answer {{that the state of}} the Province {{admitted}} of nothing but desperate remedies. I got possession of the letters my antagonist addressed to the Secretary at War, and also of the sentiments which hundreds of his army uttered to their friends. Confidence in the General was gone, and evident despondency prevailed throughout. I have succeeded beyond expectation. I crossed the river contrary to the opinion of Cols. Procter, St. George etc.; it is therefore no wonder that envy should attribute to good fortune what in justice to my own discernment, I must say, proceeded from a cool calculation of the pours and contres.|$|E

5|$|Two local magistrates, J. Bruce and Anthony Hill, were {{stranded}} in the Castle Inn in Merthyr Tydfil. They swore in around 70 men as special constables, but they were heavily outnumbered by the radical crowds. Bruce wrote an urgent letter to Bute in Cardiff Castle, asking for urgent advice on whether to call in the armed forces, and querying whether the Marquess had readied the Militia for action. Huge crowds marched on the local iron works, stopping production. The messages from Merthyr Tydfil reached Bute that afternoon, who began to assemble the Eastern and Central Yeomanry militia units and transport ready for deployment. Bute paused until the morning, hoping to hear better news, but messengers bought <b>more</b> <b>desperate</b> news from Bruce and Hill, and the Yeomanry were dispatched. Meanwhile, an 80-man unit of the 93rd Foot {{had arrived in the}} Castle Inn from Brecon. Bute continued to keep Whitehall informed of the events by letter throughout.|$|E
25|$|As the war progressed and Nazi Germany grew <b>more</b> <b>desperate,</b> the Gauleiter {{were put}} in total control of the war effort in their Gau from November 1942.|$|E
25|$|As the French became <b>more</b> <b>desperate,</b> the {{procurement}} process spiraled out of control. Eventually Gabilondo contracted with another three companies {{and at least}} 45 other companies contracted with the French directly to produce Ruby-type pistols {{in a variety of}} calibres, barrel lengths and magazine capacities.|$|E
60|$|But as he spoke, he was precipitated rudely forward, {{and hurried}} almost into Hereward's arms. The whole body of monks, {{when they heard}} Hereward's words, cared to hear no <b>more,</b> but <b>desperate</b> between fear and joy, rushed forward, bearing away their Prior in the midst.|$|R

25|$|Konoe {{made one}} <b>more</b> <b>desperate</b> attempt to avert war. He {{proposed}} a personal summit with Roosevelt–in the United States if necessary–to {{come to some}} understanding. Konoe secured backing from the Navy and the Emperor for this move. The Army agreed, provided that Konoe adhere to the consensus foreign policy, {{and be prepared to}} go to war if his initiative failed.|$|E
25|$|Another {{dangerous}} situation {{is when a}} human is faced with a hungry bear that has lost its natural fear of humans. With the decrease of hunting grounds and food crops such as berries and bark, bears often become <b>more</b> <b>desperate</b> and aggressive. However, this hunger has also triggered an unexpected reaction: bears began to follow gunfire because they associate it with dead animals that they can eat.|$|E
25|$|Earlier on, Wen Qin wanted Zhuge Dan {{to reduce}} food rations and send all {{his men to}} break the siege, while he and the troops from Eastern Wu would remain behind to guard Shouchun. Zhuge Dan {{strongly}} disapproved and quarrelled with Wen Qin over this. Although they initially cooperated, they became more suspicious and distrustful of each other as the situation in Shouchun became <b>more</b> <b>desperate.</b> Zhuge Dan eventually had Wen Qin executed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Joan, I {{have been}} {{thinking}} the thing all over last night, and have concluded {{that we have been}} in the wrong all this time; that the case of France is desperate; that it has been desperate ever since Agincourt; and that to-day it is <b>more</b> than <b>desperate,</b> it is hopeless." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the look}} of the man was different. He was a desperado, one of the dashing, {{reckless}} kind--more famous along the Pecos and Rio Grande than <b>more</b> really <b>desperate</b> men. His attire proclaimed a vanity seldom seen in any Westerner except of that unusual brand, yet it was neither gaudy or showy.|$|R

25|$|As the Allies {{kept up the}} {{pressure}} on the Japanese around Salamaua, in early September they launched an airborne assault on Nadzab, and a seaborne landing near Lae, subsequently taking the town with simultaneous drives from the east and north-west. As the situation around Lae grew <b>more</b> <b>desperate,</b> the Salamaua garrison withdrew, and it was captured on 11 September 1943, while Lae fell shortly afterwards on 16 September, bringing the campaign to an end.|$|E
25|$|As long as Cervera {{remained}} within Santiago Harbor, his fleet {{was relatively}} safe. The guns {{of the city}} were quite sufficient {{to make up for}} his fleet's deficiencies, and the area was well defended with sea mines, torpedoes and other obstructions. Nevertheless, Cervera was terribly outmatched. Though his ships were modern, they were too few, and their technical problems compounded his worries. The lack of refitting facilities in Santiago to assist with the repairs of the vessels in Cervera's squadron made the situation all the <b>more</b> <b>desperate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since {{the ending}} of the {{original}} series in 1966, Bob has left factory life behind and now works for his father-in-law's building firm (something which makes Bob even <b>more</b> <b>desperate</b> to curry favour with Thelma and her family). At Thelma's urging, Bob is also joining sports clubs and attending dinner parties, which Terry views as Bob aspiring to join the middle classes. This results in Terry viewing Bob as a class traitor, and believing his own Army experience and solid working class ethos gives him moral superiority.|$|E
50|$|The story {{takes on}} a more {{personal}} tone when the narrator leaves New York. In subsequent sections the substantive facts are replaced by a <b>more</b> intimate, <b>desperate</b> search for meaning and escape from criminal sanction and permanent addiction. Throughout, there are flashes of Burroughs's fierce originality, acutely graphic description, and agonizingly candid confessions: traits that would mark his literature for the next forty years.|$|R

60|$|Narses agreed. There {{was no use}} {{fighting}} <b>more</b> with <b>desperate</b> men. They {{should go}} in peace. And he kept his faith with them. Perhaps he dared not break it. He let them go, like a wounded lion crawling away from the hunter, up through Italy, and over the Po, to vanish. They and their name became absorbed in other nations, and history knows the East Goths no more.|$|R
25|$|Tonegaru's {{activities}} {{brought him}} to the officials' attention. In late 1946, after Grigore T. Popa was forced into hiding, Tonegaru himself became involved in more clandestine activities, by organizing anti-communist gatherings attended or hosted by dissident intellectuals, such as Gheorghe Anghel, Petru Comarnescu, Vladimir Ghika and Dinu Pillat. Suspecting that Tonegaru's home had been placed under surveillance, the Eminescu Association eventually decided to split up and keep activity to a minimum, while providing assistance to the <b>more</b> <b>desperate</b> cases. Soon after the communist regime was established in late 1947-early 1948, the wave of arrests touched members of the group, while Tonegaru continued to expose himself.|$|E
25|$|After Raymond escaped, Guy's {{position}} was now even <b>more</b> <b>desperate.</b> Most of the Christian infantry had effectively deserted by fleeing {{in a mass}} onto the Horns of Hattin where they played no further part in the battle. Overwhelmed by thirst and wounds, many were killed on the spot without resistance while the remainder were taken prisoner. Their plight was such that five of Raymond's knights {{went over to the}} Muslim leaders to beg that they be mercifully put to death. Guy attempted to pitch the tents again to block the Muslim cavalry. The Christian knights and mounted serjeants were disorganized, but still fought on.|$|E
25|$|The union hired Clarence Darrow {{to defend}} the McNamaras. Darrow, however, {{concluded}} that the brothers faced a strong chance of receiving {{the death penalty for}} the crime; he therefore made a clumsy attempt, in broad daylight in downtown Los Angeles, to bribe one of the jurors. As it turned out, it was a trap and Darrow was arrested. Now <b>more</b> <b>desperate</b> than ever, he persuaded the McNamaras to plead guilty on the basis of an unwritten plea bargain that would have freed John. Once they pleaded guilty, however, the authorities denied that they had any deal at all. John McNamara served nearly ten years, while his brother spent his remaining years in prison.|$|E
50|$|The {{search for}} Argo becomes a {{full-scale}} manhunt—as time seems to stand against Pater Balkan, he becomes even <b>more</b> determined and <b>desperate</b> to capture him. Meanwhile, Sabina, Ayessa and Jimboy bid their final farewell to their beloved Sara.|$|R
50|$|Hamlin's wives {{have each}} been {{prominent}} prime time soap-opera actresses: Rinna starred on Melrose Place, Sheridan {{was a regular}} on Knots Landing and <b>more</b> recently on <b>Desperate</b> Housewives, whereas Johnson was a regular on Falcon Crest (on which even Andress later made guest appearances).|$|R
50|$|Jared was {{the script}} {{writer for the}} game Stuntman: Ignition, by {{developers}} THQ/Paradigm Entertainment, which released August 28, 2007.
