5|$|At present, it is {{not clear}} what {{evidence}} the President may rely on to be satisfied that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the confidence of a majority of MPs, as the Singapore courts have not yet had to decide the issue. In the Sarawak case of Stephen Kalong Ningkan v. Tun Abang Haji Openg, decided on provisions similar to those in the Singapore Constitution, the court found that the phrase ceased to command the confidence of a majority of the Members of Parliament was a term of art which had to be signified by a formal vote of no confidence taken by the legislature. In contrast, a Sabah court held in Datuk Amir Kahar v. Tun <b>Mohd</b> Said bin Keruak, Yang di-Pertua Negeri Sabah that loss of confidence could be assessed on the basis of evidence other than a legislative vote. This might include, for instance, media reports or letters addressed to the President.|$|E
5|$|Bengaluru FC {{started their}} {{campaign}} in the away game against Vietnamese team Lao Toyota F.C.. A defensive lapse by Curtis Osano and an excellent free-kick just outside the penalty box from Phatthana Syvilay meant that Bengaluru were trailing by 2–0 at the 30 minutes mark. In the second half, Lao Toyota were reduced to 10 men, but Bengaluru were unable {{to capitalize on the}} chances created. However, C.K. Vineeth pulled one back in the stoppage time, and the score ended at 2–1 in the favour of the home team. Injury-ridden Bengaluru FC faced defending AFC cup champions Johor Darul Ta'zim at home. The game was decided by a solitary goal from <b>Mohd</b> Safiq Rahim in 55th minute and Bengaluru succumbed to second consecutive defeat in the AFC cup. Bengaluru FC finally secured its first win against Ayeyawady United when the solitary goal from the captain Sunil Chhetri in the first half was enough to secure 0–1 win for the team.|$|E

Later on that season he took the Indonesia Open crown, his first title since the 2006 Malaysia Open after reuniting with former coach Misbun Sidek from Li Mao. His performance at the second half of the year was solid, as he achieved three titles in the Philippines Open, the Japan Open, and the French Open. He also managed to reach the final of the China Open and Hong Kong Open, despite his knee injury haunting him on both occasions. Lee won all matches he played in the Sudirman Cup in June, despite Malaysia finishing just fifth in the tournament. Lee's low point of the year was in the World Championships, despite the tournament being held in front of his home crowd and his solid performance during the second half of the year, he was defeated in the third round by Indonesia's Sony Dwi Kuncoro.

5000|$|By far {{the most}} <b>MoH's</b> were issued to crewmen flying on Boeing aircraft. Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress crewmen {{received}} 17 awards from 1942 to 1945. Eleven of the Flying Fortress <b>MoH's</b> were posthumous awards, while in 1945 a Boeing B-29 Superfortress crewman was awarded the <b>MoH</b> for saving his plane despite crippling burns. Eleven Consolidated aircraft were involved in <b>MoH</b> missions, including two Consolidated PBY Catalinas. The <b>MoH</b> awarded to Consolidated B-24 Liberator crewmen were largely associated with the series of attacks on the Romanian oil refineries in 1943-44 although one went to a Navy PB4Y Privateer. The Grumman F4F Wildcat represents the most <b>MoH's</b> for a fighter aircraft serving in World War II by a sizable margin, with 8 <b>MoH</b> recipients. Seven F4F <b>MoH's</b> were to Marine Corps pilots, six of whom received their <b>MoH</b> for missions in the Solomon Islands during 1942-43. The lone Navy pilot was Lt. (j.g.) Edward H.

50|$|Mohs' {{technique}} was later modified by Perry Robins in the 1970s, using fresh-tissue frozen histology. Rather than using the anesthetic <b>Mohs</b> paste, local anesthetic is used.

This method is now {{commonly referred to as}} <b>Mohs</b> surgery, and occasionally chemosurgery, in reference to the <b>Mohs</b> paste that <b>Mohs</b> initially used.|$|R
50|$|Currently, the American College of <b>Mohs</b> Surgery {{has limited}} {{training}} to physicians {{who have done}} a dermatology residency.

The American Society for <b>Mohs</b> Surgery continues to encourage the training of physicians of all specialties to learn and apply the method invented by Frederic <b>Mohs.</b> The argument against physicians of other specialties than dermatology gaining <b>Mohs</b> training is that they are not adequately trained in dermatopathology. The argument for training other physicians beside dermatologists is that most <b>Mohs</b> surgeons do not make the initial diagnosis of the skin cancerthus misdiagnosis can be avoided. The pathology of <b>Mohs</b> sections are then limited to a few easily identifiable cancers, and the pathology of normal skin is simple enough to gain in a short preceptorship.|$|R

40|$|Since the {{inception}} of <b>Mohs</b> micrographic surgery in the 1930 s, this technique has proved its utility {{in the treatment of}} cutaneous tumors. This review describes the technique of <b>Mohs</b> micrographic surgery and the various indications for which it is used. We discuss the use of <b>Mohs</b> micrographic surgery for the following cutaneous tumors: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma in situ, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, Merkel cell carcinoma, microcystic adnexal carcinoma, atypical fibroxanthoma, and sebaceous carcinoma. <b>Mohs</b> micrographic surgery is cost effective in the U. S. health care system because billing for the surgeon-pathologist and laboratory processing is bundled together. However, <b>Mohs</b> micrographic surgery may be more expensive in European systems because the <b>Mohs</b> technique surgeon, pathologist, and laboratory fees may be billed separately...|$|R
50|$|The cure {{rate with}} <b>Mohs</b> surgery cited by most studies is between 97% and 99.8% for primary basal cell carcinoma, {{the most common}} type of skin cancer. <b>Mohs</b> {{procedure}} is also used for squamous cell carcinoma, but with a lower cure rate. Two isolated studies reported cure rate for primary basal cell carcinoma as low as 95% and 96%. Recurrent basal cell cancer has a lower cure rate with <b>Mohs</b> surgery, more in the range of 94%. It has been used in the removal of melanoma-in-situ (cure rate 77% to 98% depending on surgeon), and certain types of melanoma (cure rate 52%). Another study of melanoma-in-situ revealed <b>Mohs</b> cure rate of 95% for frozen section <b>Mohs,</b> and 98 to 99% for fixed tissue <b>Mohs</b> method.|$|R
