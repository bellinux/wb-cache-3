5|$|Although {{there are}} at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none have been shown to be useful in {{predicting}} survival. The most important staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, or whether it is too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be <b>made</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of surgery.|$|E

5|$|Enceladus {{is named}} after the giant Enceladus of Greek mythology. The name, like the names {{of each of the}} first seven {{satellites}} of Saturn to be discovered, was suggested by William Herschel's son John Herschel in his 1847 publication Results of Astronomical Observations <b>made</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Cape of Good Hope. He chose these names because Saturn, known in Greek mythology as Cronus, was the leader of the Titans.|$|E

There were several unsuccessful attempts to measure the parallax of Sirius: by Jacques Cassini (6 seconds); by some astronomers (including Nevil Maskelyne) using Lacaille's observations <b>made</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Cape of Good Hope (4 seconds); by Piazzi (the same amount); using Lacaille's observations made at Paris, more numerous and certain than those <b>made</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Cape (no sensible parallax); by Bessel (no sensible parallax).|$|E

5|$|Rubidium and caesium {{are often}} used in atomic clocks. Caesium atomic clocks are {{extraordinarily}} accurate; if a clock had been <b>made</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of the dinosaurs, it would be off by less than four seconds (after 80 million years). For that reason, caesium atoms are used as {{the definition of the}} second.
