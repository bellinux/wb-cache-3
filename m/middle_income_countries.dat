40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to provide an updated discussion {{on a series of}} issues that the relevant literature suggests to be crucial in dealing with the challenges a <b>middle</b> <b>income</b> <b>country</b> may encounter in its attempts to further catch-up a higher income status. In particular, the conventional economic wisdom – ranging from the Lewis-Kuznets model to the endogenous growth approach – will be contrasted with the Schumpeterian and evolutionary views pointing to the role of capabilities and knowledge, considered as key inputs to foster economic growth. Then, attention will be turned to structural change and innovation, trying to map – using the taxonomies put forward by the innovation literature – the concrete ways through which a <b>middle</b> <b>income</b> <b>country</b> can engage a technological catching-up, having in mind that developing countries are deeply involved into globalized markets where domestic innovation has to be complemented by the role played by international technological transfer. Among the ways how a <b>middle</b> <b>income</b> <b>country</b> can foster domestic innovation and structural change in terms of sectoral diversification and product differentiation, a recent stream of literature underscores the potentials of local innovative entrepreneurship, that will also be discussed bridging entrepreneurial studies with the development literature. Finally, the possible consequences of catching-up in terms of jobs and skills will be discussed...|$|R

25|$|Critics of the Kuznets curve theory {{argue that}} its U-shape {{comes not from}} {{progression}} {{in the development of}} individual countries, but rather from historical differences between countries.

When controlling for this variable, the U-shape of the curve tends to disappear (e.g. Deininger and Squire, 1998).

25|$|Globally, {{impetigo}} affects {{more than}} 162 million children in low to <b>middle</b> <b>income</b> <b>countries.</b> The rates are highest {{in countries with}} low available resources and is especially {{in the region of}} Oceania. The tropical climate and high population in lower socioeconomic regions contribute to these high rates. In children in the United Kingdom under the age of 4 are 2.8% more likely to contract impetigo and rates decreases to 1.6% for children up to 15-years-old. As age increases, the rates of impetigo declines but all ages are still susceptible.|$|E
25|$|Globally, {{high and}} <b>middle</b> <b>income</b> <b>countries</b> {{experience}} lower maternal deaths than low income countries. The Human Development Index (HDI) accounts for between 82 and 85 {{percent of the}} maternal mortality rates among countries. In most cases, high rates of maternal deaths occur in the same countries that have high rates of infant mortality. These trends are a reflection that higher income countries have stronger healthcare infrastructure, medical and healthcare personnel, use more advanced medical technologies and have fewer barriers to accessing care than low income countries. Therefore, in low income countries, {{the most common cause}} of maternal death is obstetrical hemorrhage, followed by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, in contrast to high income countries, for which the most common cause is thromboembolism.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper applies current theory {{concerning}} {{the impact of}} irreversibility of investment, {{in order to test}} for the impact of uncertainty on investment expenditure for a <b>middle</b> <b>income</b> <b>country.</b> The contribution of the paper is unique in two respects. First, it employs dynamic heterogeneous panel estimation techniques not previously applied to investment functions. Second, it explicitly tests for the impact of both sectoral and systemic uncertainty on investment expenditure. We …nd that both sectoral (as measured by output volatility around potential output) and systemic uncertainty impacts negatively on investment rates in a <b>middle</b> <b>income</b> <b>country</b> context. However, sectoral uncertainty is more important for resource intensive manufacturing sectors, while systemic uncertainty has a generalized impact across all manufacturing sectors. Standard proxies for expected return on capital stock, and the user cost of capital perform in accordance with theoretical priors...|$|R

25|$|For most {{of human}} history higher {{material}} living standards – full stomachs, access to clean water and warmth from fuel – led to better health and longer lives. This pattern of higher incomes-longer lives still holds among poorer countries, where life expectancy increases rapidly as per capita income increases, but in recent decades it has slowed down among <b>middle</b> <b>income</b> <b>countries</b> and plateaued among the richest thirty or so countries in the world. Americans live no longer on average (about 77 years in 2004) than Greeks (78 years) or New Zealanders (78), though the USA has a higher GDP per capita. Life expectancy in Sweden (80 years) and Japan (82) – where income was more equally distributed – was longer.|$|E
25|$|Several micronutrients are {{important}} {{for the health of}} the developing fetus, especially in areas of the world where insufficient nutrition is common. Women living in low and <b>middle</b> <b>income</b> <b>countries</b> are suggested to take multiple micronutrient supplements containing iron and folic acid. These supplements have been shown to improve birth outcomes in developing countries, but do not have an effect on perinatal mortality. Many developed countries suggest that all women who may become pregnant or who are pregnant take a daily multivitamin containing folic acid and iron. In developed areas, such as Western Europe and the United States, certain nutrients such as Vitamin D and calcium, required for bone development, may also require supplementation. Vitamin E supplementation has not been shown to improve birth outcomes. Zinc supplementation has been associated with a decrease in preterm birth, but it is unclear whether it is causative. Daily iron supplementation reduces the risk of maternal anemia. Studies of routine daily iron supplementation for all pregnant women in developed countries found improvement in blood iron levels, without a clear clinical benefit.|$|E

40|$|Using {{data for}} 93 {{countries}} {{for a period}} from 1970 to 2000, this paper examines the effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) on cross-country differences in productivity. We construct a spatial Gini coefficient of labor productivity across countries, and weighted indices of FDI and gross domestic investment (GDI). We then examine their time series properties to explore the relations of FDI and GDI with productivity. Although we find little evidence of FDI flows – which have increased manifold in last three decades – reducing inequality in productivity for the entire sample, our analysis shows that these three variables are cointegrated for developed, high and <b>middle</b> <b>income</b> developing <b>countries,</b> indicating existence of a long-run equilibrium relationships between FDI, GDI and productivity. FDI seems to reduce inequality in productivity among high and <b>middle</b> <b>income</b> developing <b>countries</b> while it widens productivity gaps among developed countries in the long-run though these effects are statistically significant only for high <b>income</b> developing <b>countries.</b> In <b>middle</b> <b>income</b> developing <b>countries,</b> higher GDI seems to have significant effect in reducing productivity differences. Granger causality tests further suggest that FDI causes productivity differences among petroleum exporting countries. Furthermore, GDI granger causes FDI in high <b>income</b> <b>countries</b> and productivity differences Granger cause FDI into the <b>middle</b> <b>income</b> developing <b>countries.</b> ...|$|R
