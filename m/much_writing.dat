25|$|The Great Depression {{has been}} the subject of <b>much</b> <b>writing,</b> as authors have sought to {{evaluate}} an era that caused both financial and emotional trauma. Perhaps the most noteworthy and famous novel written on the subject is The Grapes of Wrath, published in 1939 and written by John Steinbeck, who was awarded both the Nobel Prize for literature and the Pulitzer Prize for the work. The novel focuses on a poor family of sharecroppers who are forced from their home as drought, economic hardship, and changes in the agricultural industry occur during the Great Depression. Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is another important novella about a journey during the Great Depression. Additionally, Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is set during the Great Depression. Margaret Atwood's Booker prize-winning The Blind Assassin is likewise set in the Great Depression, centering on a privileged socialite's love affair with a Marxist revolutionary. The era spurred the resurgence of social realism, practiced by many who started their writing careers on relief programs, especially the Federal Writers' Project in the U.S.|$|E
500|$|Heseltine biographer Brian Collins {{considers}} the composer a prime mover in the 20th-century renaissance of early English music; apart from <b>much</b> <b>writing</b> on the subject, he made well over 500 transcriptions of early works. He also wrote or contributed to ten books, and wrote dozens of general music articles and reviews. Many years later, Gray wrote of Heseltine: [...] "In {{the memory of}} his friends, he is as alive now as he ever was when he trod the earth, and so he will continue to be until the last of us are dead". During his Eynsford years, Heseltine had provided his own epitaph: ...|$|E
500|$|Selman {{told the}} Los Angeles Times that the episode praises {{collaborative}} writing, and answers {{the question of}} whether or not writing in a group is as valuable as writing alone. He commented: [...] "I've been with The Simpsons for 15 years and [...] it's been pretty <b>much</b> <b>writing</b> as a team. We’re proud of what we've done even if it's not the traditional idea of one writer sitting down with a passion and a vision. In a strange way this episode ends up as a defense of writing in a group and celebrating the way it makes you feel connected to the work and to the people in that group in ways you didn't expect. It's all about a writers room ... and you know, in the story, Homer's cynical heist team does end up being incredibly productive." [...] The episode features several references to literature and parodies several popular young-adult book series, particularly Twilight, a vampire-themed fantasy book series by Stephenie Meyer that has received much popularity. While chasing T. R. Francis through the stadium where the dinosaur show took place, Lisa passes a bathroom in which a group of dinosaurs are smoking in reference to a Far Side comic of dinosaurs smoking. The dinosaur show itself, Sitting with Dinosaurs, is based on the live Walking with Dinosaurs show.|$|E

2500|$|Montresor's romantic {{life has}} been the subject of <b>much</b> <b>writing.</b> He married at New York 1 March 1764, Frances Tucker, who was born in New York, 23 April 1744, {{daughter}} of Thomas Tucker of Bermuda, stepdaughter of Reverend Samuel Auchmuty and half-sister of General Sir Samuel Auchmuty. [...] She returned to England with her husband, and survived him, dying 28 June 1828, at Rose Hill, Kent. [...] By her, he had, with others, General Sir Henry Tucker Montresor, General Sir Thomas Gage Montresor, and Mary Lucy Montresor, who became the first wife of General Sir Frederick William Mulcaster (half-brother of Capt Sir William Howe Mulcaster).|$|E
2500|$|Justman praised Fontana's version, {{saying that}} it was the version which was most likely to be shot. But he {{suggested}} that it had now lost the [...] "beauty and mystery inherent in the screenplay as Harlan originally wrote it." [...] He said that he felt bad, because if he had not seen Ellison's earlier versions then he would probably have been [...] "thrilled" [...] with Fontana's version. Still unsatisfied with the script, Roddenberry set about rewriting it once more, entitling the result, dated February 1, the final draft. Ellison later called elements of the dialogue in this version [...] "precisely the kind of dopey Utopian bullshit that Roddenberry loved", and added that Roddenberry had [...] "about as <b>much</b> <b>writing</b> ability as the lowest industry hack". However, Shatner later believed that it was actually re-written by Gene L. Coon and only supervised by Roddenberry. Ellison requested via his agent that he be credited on the script only as Cordwainer Bird. In response, [...] Roddenberry threatened to have Ellison blacklisted by the Writers Guild of America, and the writer was eventually convinced to be credited by name. None of the other writers involved in the work chose to seek credit for the script, since they agreed with Roddenberry that it was important for Star Trek to be associated with writers such as Ellison.|$|E

2500|$|Harry and the Potters is the eponymous debut studio album by indie {{rock band}} Harry and the Potters, {{released}} on 21 June 2003. The album {{was inspired by}} the first four novels in the Harry Potter book series. It has been released on CD and digital download. In April 2003, the brothers wrote an entire album's worth of songs. The brothers split songwriting responsibilities between the two of them: Joe was responsible for songs dealing with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, whereas Paul was responsible for songs dealing with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Harry and the Potters was recorded [...] at the DeGeorge Family Living Room in Massachusetts. According to Melissa Anelli, Paul wrote the majority of the instrumental tracks on his Casio keyboard, whereas Joe conceptualized most of the vocal tracks. Vocalist Paul DeGeorge later said, [...] "We were pretty <b>much</b> <b>writing</b> songs and then recording them on the spot". This statement emphasizes the band's do-it-yourself amateurishness as an essential aspect of the album. In recording Harry and the Potters, the band aimed to release the album shortly before the fifth book in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was released. According to Paul, [...] "We were in a rush to get that stuff done before the 5th book release" [...] and this instinct supports claims it took only two weekends to record the album. Despite the band's purported rush to finish the album, Paul and Joe worked particularly hard on the song [...] "These Days are Dark." [...] Paul DeGeorge used $1,200 of his own money to finance the pressing of the CDs.|$|E
2500|$|Bonwick and {{his wife}} arrived at Hobart on 10 October 1841. He was a {{successful}} teacher in Hobart for eight years and published {{the first of his}} many school books Geography for the Use of Australian Youth in 1845. He went to Adelaide in 1850, and opened a private school. In 1852 {{made his way to the}} Victorian gold diggings after finding himself in debt. He did not find much gold, but his health benefited. He then went to Melbourne where he published [...] from October 1852 until its final edition in May 1853. [...] In 1852 he also published [...] He then established a successful boarding school at Kew now a suburb of Melbourne. He had already published several school books and pamphlets, when in 1856 he published his Discovery and Settlement of Port Phillip, the first of his historical works. About this time he joined the Victorian government service as an inspector of denominational schools, and in 1857 made a tour of inspection through the western district of Victoria. He then made Ballarat his centre and worked there for about four years. During his journeys he suffered from sunstroke and a coaching accident, and became so ill that he had to retire from the service. He was given 18 months' leave of absence, but was unable to continue this work. His head had been injured in the accident. He was never able to ride a horse again, and he was always liable to have an attack of giddiness. He visited England in 1860 and then returned to Melbourne in July 1862 and opened a school in the suburb of St Kilda, which became very prosperous. He paid another visit to England with his wife, leaving the school in the hands of a son and a friend of his. They, however, mismanaged the school, and Bonwick was compelled to return and put things in order again. He was doing <b>much</b> <b>writing,</b> and in the ensuing years travelled in various parts of Australia, New Zealand and Europe.|$|E

An honorable man, and good citizen; discharging, with unblamable correctness, all functions and duties laid on him by the customs (mores) of the society he lived in,--with correctness and something more. In all these particulars, a man perfectly moral, or of approved virtue according to the rules.|$|E
