40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if chronic shoulder pain had an effect on arm abduction strength and recruitment strategies of the serratus anterior, <b>middle</b> deltoid, <b>and</b> <b>upper</b> trapezius. Method: The maximal isometric force at 30 ° arm abduction and the electromyographic activity of the serratus anterior, <b>middle</b> deltoid, <b>and</b> <b>upper</b> trapezius were recorded for 14 subjects with unilateral chronic shoulder pain and 11 healthy subjects. Results: Relative to the group without pain, the group with chronic shoulder pain showed no significant difference in maximal force production during isometric arm abduction. The Mann–Whitney tests showed no differences in the activation of the serratus anterior, <b>middle</b> deltoid, <b>and</b> <b>upper</b> trapezius between the two groups. Discussion and conclusion: Subjects with chronic shoulder pain of mild to moderate intensity showed no difference from healthy subjects in arm abduction maximal strength, and recruitment patterns of serratus anterior, <b>middle</b> deltoid, <b>and</b> <b>upper</b> trapezius...|$|R

5|$|As {{distance}} between {{the mouth of the}} St. Johns and the <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> <b>upper</b> basins increases, the salinity in the river gradually decreases. Marine water measures at 35parts per thousand (ppt) or more while fresh water measures below 2ppt. What ranges in between is characterized as brackish water. Near the center of Jacksonville, average measures have been collected at 11.40ppt. Farther south at the Buckman Bridge, joining the south side of Jacksonville to Orange Park, it decreases to 2.9ppt and falls again to 0.81ppt at the Shands Bridge near Green Cove Springs.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{foundation}} of IFK Göteborg, the dominant club in the Gothenburg area was Örgryte IS, which was considered a <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> <b>upper</b> class club. IFK became popular amongst the working class, creating a fierce rivalry based upon both local pride and social class. In the early 20th century, supporters were supposed to act as gentlemen, applauding and supporting both their own team, and the opponents. However, this proved a hard task for supporters of the Gothenburg teams. Local patriotism and class differences sometimes resulted in fights and pitch invasions, making the Swedish press view IFK and Örgryte fans as the scum of Swedish football.|$|E

5|$|During the {{afternoon}} hours of February10, 2009, a strong, <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> <b>upper</b> storm system {{moved across the}} Four Corners region into the central and southern Great Plains. A moist, low-level air mass streamed northward across Texas and Louisiana into eastern Oklahoma and the Ozarks ahead of the system. Daytime heating of the moistening boundary layer increased throughout {{the afternoon}} across Oklahoma and Texas as cloud cover shifted eastward. Cooling aloft, {{in conjunction with the}} approaching storm system, led to atmospheric instability, resulting in thunderstorms. A very strong wind field increased with height through the lower troposphere, resulting in a wind shear favorable for rotation in the thunderstorms.|$|E

Villages with domesticated cattle, sheep, and goats and evidence of agriculture began as early as 6000 BC, and gradually developed between c. 4000 and 1500 BC beginning with the Indus Valley Civilisation and Harappa Culture to the Vedic period and extending into the Iron Age.|$|E
5|$|Olive oil was a {{ubiquitous}} {{ingredient in}} Mediterranean cultures, but remained an expensive import {{in the north}} where oils of poppy, walnut, hazel and filbert were the most affordable alternatives. Butter and lard, especially after the terrible mortality during the Black Death made them less scarce, were used in considerable quantities in the northern and northwestern regions, especially in the Low Countries. Almost universal in <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> <b>upper</b> class cooking all over Europe was the almond, {{which was in the}} ubiquitous and highly versatile almond milk, which was used as a substitute in dishes that otherwise required eggs or milk, though the bitter variety of almonds came along much later.|$|E

5|$|Tangascootack Creek is {{considered}} to be a cold water fishery. The tributary North Fork Tangascootack Creek has significant trout and macroinvertebrate populations. On the main stem of the creek, there are limited numbers of fish and some aquatic ecosystems, though in the <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> <b>upper</b> parts of the creek, there is virtually no life in the water. Near the headwaters and Bear Swamp, there is some aquatic life, as these locations are upstream of the strip mines and acid mine drainage. The main species of fish in the creek are brook trout, Semotilus atromaculatus, Catostomus commersoni, and Rhinichthys atratulus. Young-of-the-Year trout also live in the creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{letters and}} diaries of working-class people and ex-servicemen {{generally}} demonstrate {{support for the}} King, while those from the <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> <b>upper</b> classes tend to express indignation and distaste. The Times, The Morning Post, Daily Herald, and newspapers owned by Lord Kemsley, such as The Daily Telegraph, opposed the marriage. On the other hand, the Express and Mail newspapers, owned by Lord Beaverbrook and Lord Rothermere, respectively, appeared to support a morganatic marriage. The King estimated that the newspapers in favour had a circulation of 12.5million, and those against had 8.5million.|$|E
5|$|The street {{became popular}} with entertainers {{including}} bear-baiters, theatres and public houses.

The gallows were removed in 1783, {{and by the end}} of the century, Oxford Street was built up from St Giles Circus to Park Lane, containing a mix of residential houses and entertainment.

5|$|At Panxian, {{there appears}} to have been a {{transition}} in the endemic marine reptile fauna, possibly caused by volcanism. This volcanism is indicated by the presence of a bentonite layer between the <b>Middle</b> <b>and</b> <b>Upper</b> Reptile Horizons. From lower in the Upper Reptile Horizon, fossils have also been found of the ubiquitous mixosaurian ichthyosaur Mixosaurus panxianensis (which occurs in all layers), the pachypleurosaurs Keichousaurus sp. and Wumengosaurus delicatomandibularis, and fish, although fossils of the latter are fragmentary. The lower Middle and Lower Reptile Horizons also include the mixosaurian Phalarodon cf. fraasi, the primitive ichthyosaur Xinminosaurus catactes, the placodont Placodus inexpectatus, the nothosaurs Lariosaurus hongguoensis and Nothosaurus yangjuanensis, and the archosaur Qianosuchus mixtus, alongside bivalves and saurichthyid fish.|$|E
5|$|By 2000 the City of Portland {{had spent}} about $200million to nearly {{eliminate}} CSOs {{from entering the}} slough. It also replaced septic tank and cesspool systems near the <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> <b>upper</b> slough with sanitary sewers. BES analysis of water samples taken between 1995 and 2002 showed {{that by the end}} of this period DEQ water quality standards for Escherichia coli, the indicator organism for fecal contamination, were nearly always being met in the upper and middle sloughs and generally being met in the lower slough. Despite these and other improvements in water quality, the slough is not a safe source of edible fish. The Multnomah County Health Department and other agencies have advised people to avoid or greatly reduce consumption of fish and crayfish from the slough because they contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and pesticides.|$|E
5|$|State {{schools in}} Somerset are {{provided}} by three local education authorities: Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset, and the larger Somerset County Council.
