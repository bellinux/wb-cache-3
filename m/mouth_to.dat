5|$|Balaenopterids are the rorquals. These animals, {{along with}} the cetotheriids, rely on their throat pleats to gulp large amounts of water while feeding. The throat pleats extend from the <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> the navel and allow the <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> expand to a large volume for more {{efficient}} capture of the small animals they feed on. Balaenopterids consist of two genera and eight species.|$|E
50|$|The {{teeth of}} plankton-feeders, {{such as the}} basking shark and whale shark, are greatly reduced and non-functional.1 These sharks filter feed on prey by opening their <b>mouths</b> <b>to</b> let tiny organisms get sucked into their <b>mouths</b> <b>to</b> feed without using their teeth at all.|$|R

50|$|While kissing sexual {{partners}} usually limit their selves <b>to</b> <b>mouths</b> and then forget about ears nearby <b>mouths.</b> <b>To</b> enforce stimuli they remove (fast and tiny) kisses from lips, throughout jawbone until {{the place of}} binding earlobe with the part of skin behind the jawbone.|$|R
5|$|Young orangutans also beg {{for food}} by such contact and {{accordingly}} their caretakers regurgitate to feed them. Indeed, behaviours of <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> mouth feeding of premasticated food and ritualized <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> mouth contact for bonding {{has been observed}} in anthropoid great apes such as gorillas, orangutans, and chimpanzees. All of this supports the idea that human behaviours of kissing and feeding of premastication foods, {{either directly or indirectly}} from the mouth, have their behavioural roots in higher animals and ancestral great apes.|$|E
5|$|Digestion {{can take}} a long time. The food moves from the <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> a J-shaped stomach, where it is stored and initial {{digestion}} occurs. Unwanted items may never get past the stomach, and instead the shark either vomits or turns its stomachs inside out and ejects unwanted items from its mouth.|$|E
5|$|From <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> source, Aliso Creek {{is joined}} by six major tributaries. All of these tributaries {{as well as several}} others are listed. Another 46minor streams and drains flow into the creek.|$|E

5|$|As James and Scamper {{entered the}} arena that night, Scamper caught his bridle {{on the side}} of the gate, dislodging the Chicago screws. With no screws, the headstall broke loose from the bridle after she made the turn around the first barrel. When she strove for the second barrel, the bridle was hanging from the horse's <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> down under his foot. Meanwhile, she is trying to hold that bit in his mouth. But coming to the third barrel, she has to turn his head loose.|$|E
5|$|Crohn's {{disease is}} a type of {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> anus. Signs and symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody if inflammation is severe), fever, and weight loss. Other complications may occur outside the gastrointestinal tract and include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and tiredness. The skin rashes may be due to infections as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction also commonly occurs and those with the disease are at greater risk of bowel cancer.|$|E
5|$|Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} the position of parts of the mouth. EMA uses sensor coils placed on the tongue {{and other parts of}} the <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> measure their position and movement over time during speech and swallowing. Induction coils around the head produce an electromagnetic field that creates, or induces, a current in the sensors in the mouth. Because the current induced is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance, a computer is able to analyse the current produced and determine the sensor coil's location in space.|$|E

At FBI headquarters, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) meets Agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens), Cassandra's son, who fears the damage to his reputation if his colleagues learn about his mother. He tells Scully to keep Mulder away from her.|$|E
5|$|In many human {{cultures}}, {{the act of}} premastication {{and direct}} mouth-to-mouth feeding is linked with the showing of affection, known as kiss feeding. In the Manus cultures of the Admiralty Islands, the act of premastication {{has been used by}} a women to remind children and descendants of their obligations to her. Some human cultures such as the people of Papua New Guinea in fact use <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> mouth contact primarily for feeding premasticated food, with sexual kissing only observed after the arrival of Europeans. This form of feeding is believed to have evolved into the modern human acts of kissing and French kissing.|$|E
5|$|Lizards have skulls {{with only}} one fenestra on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly {{attached}} which allows the <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.|$|E
50|$|The act of 'kissing the shuttle', {{in which}} weavers used their <b>mouths</b> <b>to</b> pull thread {{through the eye}} of a shuttle when the pirn was replaced, contributed to the spread of disease.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the main}} methods of {{removing}} thallium (both radioactive and normal) from humans is to use Prussian blue, a material which absorbs thallium. Up to 20g per day of Prussian blue is fed by <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> the person, and it passes through their digestive system and comes out in the stool. Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are also used to remove thallium from the blood serum. At later stage of the treatment additional potassium is used to mobilize thallium from the tissue.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the body}} of many species is almost {{radially}} symmetrical, the main axis is oral to aboral (from the <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> the opposite end). However, since {{only two of the}} canals near the statocyst terminate in anal pores, ctenophores have no mirror-symmetry, although many have rotational symmetry, in other words if the animal rotates in a half-circle it looks the same as when it started.|$|E
5|$|The main {{structure}} of an insect's digestive {{system is a}} long enclosed tube called the alimentary canal, which runs lengthwise through the body. The alimentary canal directs food unidirectionally from the <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> the anus. It has three sections, each of which performs a different process of digestion. In addition to the alimentary canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax, adjacent to the foregut.|$|E
50|$|Total {{dependency}} ratio in Castilla was computed at 86.57%, which indicates more <b>mouths</b> <b>to</b> feed {{for those with}} gainful employment. Young {{dependency ratio}} was computed at 79.97% while old dependency ratio was 6.60%.|$|R
