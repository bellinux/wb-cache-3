60|$|As it {{appeared}} probable that this plant would capture {{a greater number}} of animals in its native country than under culture, I obtained permission to remove small portions of the rhizomes from dried specimens in the herbarium at Kew. I did not at first find out that it was advisable to soak the rhizomes for two or three days, and that it was necessary to open the bladders and spread out their contents on glass; as from their state of decay and from having been dried and pressed, their nature could not otherwise be well distinguished. Several bladders on a plant which had grown in black earth in New Granada were first examined; and four of these included remnants of animals. The first contained a hairy Acarus, so much decayed that nothing was left except its transparent coat; [page 437] also a yellow chitinous head of some animal with an internal fork, to which the oesophagus was suspended, but I could see no mandibles; also the double hook of the tarsus of some animal; also an elongated greatly decayed animal; and lastly, a curious flask-shaped organism, having the walls formed of rounded cells. Professor Claus has looked at this latter organism, and thinks that it is the shell of a rhizopod, probably one of the Arcellidae. In this bladder, as well as in several others, there were some unicellular Algae, and one <b>multicellular</b> <b>Alga,</b> which no doubt had lived as intruders.|$|E
40|$|Proof {{that plants}} possess homologs of animal {{adhesion}} proteins is lacking. In this paper {{we describe the}} generation of monoclonal antibodies that interfere with cell-cell contacts in the 4 -cell embryo of the <b>multicellular</b> <b>alga</b> Volvox carteri, resulting in a hole between the cells. The number of following cell divisions is reduced and the cell division pattern is altered drastically. Antibodies given at a later stage of embryogenesis specifically inhibit inversion of the embryo, a morphogenetic movement that turns the embryo inside out. Immunofluorescence microscopy localizes the antigen (Algal-CAM) at cell contact sites of the developing embryo. Algal-CAM is a protein with a three-domain structure: an N-terminal extensin-like domain characteristic for plant cell walls and two repeats with homology to fasciclin I, a cell adhesion molecule involved in the neuronal development of Drosophila. Alternatively spliced variants of Algal-CAM mRNA were detected that are produced under developmental control. Thus, Algal-CAM is the first plant homolog of animal adhesion proteins...|$|E

With the recent report of successful transformation, regulated promoters as well as reporter genes working in this organism are now required. The Volvox genes encoding arylsulfatase and the extracellular glycoprotein ISG are strictly regulated. The former is transcribed only under conditions of sulfur starvation, whereas the latter operates under extreme developmental control [...] i. e., it is transcribed for only a few minutes in Volvox embryos at the stage of embryonic inversion. The gene encoding the sexual pheromone of Volvox carteri was placed {{under the control of the}} arylsulfatase promoter. In response to sulfur deprivation, V. carteri transformed by this construct synthesized and secreted biologically active pheromone. In addition, the gene encoding Volvox arylsulfatase was placed under the control of the ISG promoter. Transformed algae synthesized arylsulfatase mRNA only during embryonic inversion. These experiments demonstrate the usefulness of both the arylsulfatase and the sexual pheromone reporter genes. In addition, the highly regulated arylsulfatase promoter allows the construction of inducible expression vectors for cloned genes...|$|E

40|$|Cilia and flagella often exhibit {{synchronized}} behavior; {{this includes}} phase locking, {{as seen in}} Chlamydomonas, and metachronal wave formation in the respiratory cilia of higher organisms. Since the observations by Gray and Rothschild of phase synchrony of nearby swimming spermatozoa, {{it has been a}} working hypothesis that synchrony arises from hydrodynamic interactions between beating filaments. Recent work on the dynamics of physically separated pairs of flagella isolated from the <b>multicellular</b> <b>alga</b> Volvox has shown that hydrodynamic coupling alone is sufficient to produce synchrony. However, the situation is more complex in unicellular organisms bearing few flagella. We show that flagella of Chlamydomonas mutants deficient in filamentary connections between basal bodies display markedly different synchronization from the wild type. We perform micromanipulation on configurations of flagella and conclude that a mechanism, internal to the cell, must provide an additional flagellar coupling. In naturally occurring species with 4, 8, or even 16 flagella, we find diverse symmetries of basal body positioning and of the flagellar apparatus that are coincident with specific gaits of flagellar actuation, suggesting that it is a competition between intracellular coupling and hydrodynamic interactions that ultimately determines the precise form of flagellar coordination in unicellular algae.

40|$|Somatic {{cells of}} the <b>multicellular</b> <b>alga</b> Volvox carteri contain a visual {{rhodopsin}} that controls the organism's phototactic behavior via two independent photoreceptor currents. Here, we report the identification of an opsinlike gene, designated as volvoxopsin (vop). The encoded protein exhibits homologies to the opsin of the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (chlamyopsin) and to the entire animal opsin family, thus providing new perspectives on opsin evolution. Volvoxopsin accumulates within the eyes of somatic cells. However, the vop transcript is detectable only in the reproductive eyeless gonidia and embryos. vop mRNA levels increase 400 -fold during embryogenesis, when embryos develop in darkness, whereas the vop transcript does not accumulate when embryos develop in the light. An antisense transformant, T 3, was generated. This transformant produces 10 times less volvoxopsin than does the wild type. In T 3, the vop transcript is virtually absent, whereas the antisense transcript is predominant and light regulated. It follows that vop expression is under light-dependent transcriptional control but that volvoxopsin itself is not the regulatory photoreceptor. Transformant T 3 is phototactic, but its phototactic sensitivity is reduced 10 -fold relative to the parental wild-type strain HK 10. Thus, we offer definitive genetic evidence that a rhodopsin serves as the photoreceptor for phototaxis in a green alga...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The <b>multicellular</b> <b>alga</b> Volvox carteri {{possesses}} {{only two}} cell types: mortal, motile somatic cells and potentially immortal, immotile reproductive cells. It is therefore an attractive model system for studying how cell-autonomous cytodifferentiation is programmed within a genome. Moreover, there are ongoing genome projects both in Volvox carteri {{and in the}} closely related unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. However, gene sequencing is only the beginning. To identify cell-type specific expression and to determine relative expression rates, we evaluate the potential of real-time RT-PCR for quantifying gene transcript levels. Results Here we analyze a diversified pool of 39 target genes by real-time RT-PCR for each cell type. This gene pool contains previously known genes with unknown localization of cellular expression, 28 novel genes which are described in this study for the first time, and a few known, cell-type specific genes as a control. The respective gene products are, for instance, part of photosynthesis, cellular regulation, stress response, or transport processes. We provide expression data for all these genes. Conclusion The results show that quantitative real-time RT-PCR is a favorable approach to analyze cell-type specific gene expression in Volvox, which can be extended to a much larger number of genes or to developmental or metabolic mutants. Our expression data also {{provide a basis for}} a detailed analysis of individual, previously unknown, cell-type specifically expressed genes. </p...|$|E

40|$|Nearly all land plants post‐transcriptionally modify {{specific}} nucleotides within RNAs, {{a process}} known as RNA editing. This adaptation allows the correction of deleterious mutations within the asexually reproducing and presumably non‐recombinant chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes. There are no reports of RNA editing in any of the green algae so this phenomenon is presumed to have originated in embryophytes either after the invasion of land or in the now extinct algal ancestor of all land plants. This was challenged when a recent in silico screen for RNA edit sites based on genomic sequence homology predicted edit sites in the green alga Chara vulgaris, a <b>multicellular</b> <b>alga</b> found within the Streptophyta clade and one of the closest extant algal relatives of land plants. In this study, the organelle transcriptomes of C. vulgaris and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were deep sequenced for a comprehensive assessment of RNA editing. Initial analyses based solely on sequence comparisons suggested potential edit sites in both species, but subsequent high‐resolution melt analysis, RNase H‐dependent PCR (rhPCR), and Sanger sequencing of DNA and complementary DNAs (cDNAs) from each of the putative edit sites revealed them to be either single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or spurious deep sequencing results.

40|$|Groups of {{eukaryotic}} cilia and flagella {{are capable}} of coordinating their beating over large scales, routinely exhibiting collective dynamics {{in the form of}} metachronal waves.

Here we characterize in detail flagellar coordination on the surface of the <b>multicellular</b> <b>alga</b> Volvox carteri, an emerging model organism for flagellar dynamics. Our studies reveal for the first time that the average metachronal coordination observed is punctuated by periodic phase defects during which synchrony is partial and limited to specific groups of cells. A minimal model of hydrodynamically coupled oscillators can reproduce semi-quantitatively the characteristics of the average metachronal dynamics, and the emergence of defects. We systematically study the model's behaviour by assessing the effect of changing intrinsic rotor characteristics, including oscillator stiffness and the nature of their internal driving force, as well as their geometric properties and spatial arrangement. Our results suggest that metachronal coordination follows from deformations in the oscillators' limit cycles induced by hydrodynamic stresses, and that defects result from sufficiently steep local biases in the oscillators' intrinsic frequencies. Additionally, we find that random variations in the intrinsic rotor frequencies increase the robustness of the average properties of the emergent metachronal waves.

40|$|The {{macro-alga}} Fucus vesiculosus has a broad {{global and}} estuarine distribution and exhibits exceptional resistance to toxic metals, the molecular basis {{of which is}} poorly understood. To address this issue a cDNA library was constructed from an environmental isolate of F. vesiculosus growing in an area with chronic copper pollution. Characterisation of this library led to the identification of a cDNA encoding a protein known to be synthesised in response to toxicity, a full length 14 - 3 - 3 exhibiting a 71 % identity to human/mouse epsilon isoform, 70 – 71 % identity to yeast BMH 1 / 2 and 95 and 71 % identity to the Ectocarpus siliculosus 14 - 3 - 3 isoforms 1 and 2 respectively. Preliminary characterisation of the expression profile of the 14 - 3 - 3 indicated concentration- and time-dependent inductions on acute exposure of F. vesiculosus of copper (3 – 30 μg/l). Higher concentrations of copper (≥ 150 μg/l) did not elicit significant induction of the 14 - 3 - 3 gene compared with the control even though levels of both intracellular copper and {{the expression of a}} cytosolic metal chaperone, metallothionein, continued to rise.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{fundamental}} step {{in evolution}} was {{the transition from}} unicellular to differentiated, multicellular organisms. Volvocine algae {{have been used for}} several decades as a model lineage to investigate the evolutionary aspects of multicellularity and cellular differentiation. There are two well-studied volvocine species, a unicellular alga (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) and a <b>multicellular</b> <b>alga</b> with differentiated cell types (Volvox carteri). Species with intermediate characteristics also exist, which blur the boundaries between unicellularity and differentiated multicellularity. These species include the globular alga Eudorina elegans, which is composed of 16 – 32 cells. However, detailed molecular analyses of E. elegans require genetic manipulation. Unfortunately, genetic engineering has not yet been established for Eudorina, and only limited DNA and/or protein sequence information is available. Results Here, we describe the stable nuclear transformation of E. elegans by particle bombardment using both a chimeric selectable marker and reporter genes from different heterologous sources. Transgenic algae resistant to paromomycin were achieved using the aminoglycoside 3 ′ -phosphotransferase VIII (aph VIII) gene of Streptomyces rimosus, an actinobacterium, under the control of an artificial promoter consisting of two V. carteri promoters in tandem. Transformants exhibited an increase in resistance to paromomycin by up to 333 -fold. Co-transformation with non-selectable plasmids was achieved with a rate of 50 - 100 %. The luciferase (gluc) gene from the marine copepod Gaussia princeps, which previously was engineered to match the codon usage of C. reinhardtii, was used as a reporter gene. The expression of gluc was mediated by promoters from C. reinhardtii and V. carteri. Heterologous heat shock promoters induced an increase in luciferase activity (up to 600 -fold) at elevated temperatures. Long-term stability and both constitutive and inducible expression of the co-bombarded gluc gene was demonstrated by transcription analysis and bioluminescence assays. Conclusions Heterologous flanking sequences, including promoters, work in E. elegans and permit both constitutive and inducible expression of heterologous genes. Stable nuclear transformation of E. elegans is now routine. Thus, we show that genetic engineering of a species is possible even without the resources of endogenous genes and promoters. </p...|$|E
40|$|P 2 X receptors are ATP-gated ion {{channels}} with myriad {{roles in}} humans and other higher vertebrates. Research {{over the past}} decade has described the cloning, pharmacology, and physiological role of this receptor family in a number of invertebrate organisms, as well as in unicellular amoeba and algae. However, questions remain regarding the extant of P 2 X receptor phylogeny and function in many invertebrates. A greater understanding of invertebrate P 2 X receptor pharmacology and function may provide insights into structure-function relationships in “higher” homologues, as well as novel roles for this ligand-gated ion channel family. This thesis investigated P 2 X receptor expression and function within eukaryotic phylogeny, with particular emphasis on invertebrate animals. Homology searching of transcriptomic and genomic datasets identified a number of candidate P 2 X receptor sequences across a range of phyla. Notably, homologues were bioinformatically identified within orders of the class Insecta, where they had been previously thought to be absent. Homologous sequences were also identified in a <b>multicellular</b> <b>alga</b> of the Charophycea, a class of the Viridiplantae division Charophyta, considered to represent the closest extant taxon to terrestrial plants. Following the identification of a P 2 X receptor homologue in the cnidarian Hydra vulgaris (AEP) (‘aepP 2 X’) by bioinformatics approaches, total RNA preparations were used for cDNA synthesis to generate templates for PCR to yield aepP 2 X clones. These clones encoded proteins that exhibited concentration-dependent ATP-evoked inward currents when expressed heterologously in HEK 293 cells (EC 50 ca. 120 μM; holding potential of - 60 mV). Co-application of the classic P 2 receptor antagonists pyridoxalphosphate- 6 -azophenyl- 2 ', 5 '-disulphonic acid (PPADS) and suramin was ineffective, as were phenol red and brilliant blue G (BBG). The synthetic ATP analogues α,β-methylene ATP and β,γ-methylene ATP (1 mM) did not evoke currents at aepP 2 X. Consistent with most mammalian homologues, aepP 2 X was found to be a non-selective cation channel with negligible chloride ion permeability. Immunohistochemistry using a custom polyclonal antiserum raised against a C- terminal epitope of aepP 2 X suggested the expression of this receptor occurs in developing and late-stage nematocysts in whole Hydra polyps. A P 2 X receptor from the microcrustacean Daphnia pulex (DpuP 2 XB) was also expressed heterologously in HEK 293 cells, and was found to be largely insensitive to extracellular ATP (EC 50 > 1 mM), although reduction of total divalent cation concentration of perfusing extracellular solution partially restored ATP sensitivity in DpuP 2 XB. Whilst a P 2 X receptor homologue from the placazoan, Trichoplax adhaerens (TadP 2 XA) did not respond to extracellular ATP in HEK 293 cells, a P 2 X receptor from the lancelet Branchiostoma floridae (BfloP 2 X) does respond in a concentration-dependent manner to A TP. Currents evoked through BfloP 2 X displayed rundown with repeated 1 mM ATP applications...|$|E
