5|$|The attempt {{had great}} {{influence}} on Reagan's popularity; polls indicated {{his approval rating}} to be around 73%. Reagan believed that God had spared his life so that he <b>might</b> <b>go</b> on to fulfill a greater purpose and, although not a Catholic, meetings with Mother Teresa, Cardinal Terence Cooke, and fellow shooting survivor Pope John Paul II reinforced his belief. Agent Parr {{came to believe that}} God had directed his life to save Reagan, and became a pastor.|$|E

5|$|Chinese geographers such as Jia Dan wrote {{accurate}} {{descriptions of}} places far abroad. In his work written between 785 and 805, {{he described the}} sea route going {{into the mouth of}} the Persian Gulf, and that the medieval Iranians (whom he called the people of Luo-He-Yi) had erected 'ornamental pillars' in the sea that acted as lighthouse beacons for ships that <b>might</b> <b>go</b> astray. Confirming Jia's reports about lighthouses in the Persian Gulf, Arabic writers a century after Jia wrote of the same structures, writers such as al-Mas'udi and al-Muqaddasi. The Tang dynasty Chinese diplomat Wang Xuance traveled to Magadha (modern northeastern India) during the 7th century. Afterwards he wrote the book Zhang Tianzhu Guotu (Illustrated Accounts of Central India), which included a wealth of geographical information.|$|E
5|$|Girl Pat left Grimsby on 1 April 1936. According to Stone's later account, {{when they}} entered the open sea, Orsborne {{assembled}} the crew—except for Jefferson—in the wheelhouse {{and told them that}} this would not be a normal fishing trip. Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson, who was not included in his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and <b>might</b> <b>go</b> fishing for pearls.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} early modern {{individuals}} experienced {{a period of}} youth in the modern sense. For many the early teens were marked by moving away from home to undertake life-cycle service, which was necessary {{so that they could}} build up skills and capital that would enable them to marry and create a separate household. Lower down in society boys might be apprenticed to a trade, or become agricultural servants. Girls <b>might</b> <b>go</b> into domestic or agricultural service. For those higher up in society and increasingly for those lower down, this might be after a period of schooling or even university.|$|E

By limiting South African retaliation to half a dozen army battalions and police units, the transition process was ultimately saved." ...|$|R

5|$|In March 1936, for {{his second}} voyage in Gipsy Love, Orsborne {{attempted}} to engage the services of an experienced seaman, Alexander MacLean, to whom he confided that the trip <b>might</b> <b>go</b> further afield—perhaps to Bermuda or South America—but MacLean declined the opportunity. Orsborne offered the mate's berth to Harry Stone, a local seaman who did not possess a mate's ticket but was told by Orsborne that he could use MacLean's number. The other crew members were a Yorkshireman, Hector Harris, and a 17-year-old Scottish cook, Howard Stephens. The formal crew was joined by Orsborne's younger brother James, a grocer, who had no formal status on board and was later classified as a stowaway. Gipsy Love left Grimsby late in March 1936, supposedly to fish in the Dogger Bank area of the North Sea, but within hours had returned to port with engine trouble. With {{the consent of the}} owners, Orsborne transferred stores and crew to another Marstrand vessel, the small trawler Girl Pat; James Orsborne again joined them.|$|E
5|$|Streltsov was {{released}} on 4 February 1963, five years into his twelve-year sentence, and owing to the ban from professional play began to split his time between work at the ZiL factory {{and the study of}} automotive engineering at the attached technical college. After failing to patch up his differences with Alla, he married Raisa Mikhailovna in September 1963. He started to play for the amateur factory team, which caused it to attract large crowds, both at home and away. When the ZiL side travelled to Gorky for an away match late in the 1964 season, the team's coach received orders from above not to play Streltsov, something which spectators noticed immediately when the match started; during the first half, they began to riot and threatened to burn down the stadium, chanting Streltsov's name. Worried that the angry crowd <b>might</b> <b>go</b> through with this, the Gorky factory chief ordered the ZiL coach to send Streltsov out for the second half. On stepping onto the field, the former Gulag prisoner received a standing ovation.|$|E
5|$|On October 21, 2010, Miller and Bello jointly {{announced}} on ESPNU {{that they would}} attend Baylor University. In August 2010, Scout.com had named Miller their number two prospect in the country behind Anthony Davis. At {{the time of the}} announcement, Miller was the top-ranked high school class of 2011 power forward in the nation according to Rivals.com and the number two prospect in the nation behind Gilchrist according to PrepStars Rob Harrington, who had thought he <b>might</b> <b>go</b> to Louisville. In November, Miller and Bello signed their letters of intent. At the time he signed his letter of intent, he was ranked the 2nd best player in the nation by Scout.com and PrepStar, while Rivals.com listed him fifth. In 2011, Big12Sports.com has repeatedly described Miller as a potential Top 10 draft pick. As an incoming freshman for the 2011–12 Bears, he was one of five Big 12 Conference players named to the Naismith College Player of the Year preseason top 50 watchlist. Baylor entered the season without 2011–12 Big 12 Conference basketball season preseason player of the year Perry Jones who was on a five-game suspension for having accepted improper benefits before arriving at Baylor. Nonetheless, Dime Magazine included Miller, Jones and Bello in its list of Top 25 Breakout Players & Teams To Watch In The NBA, College & High School This Season.|$|E

25|$|These epithets are {{associated}} with the ritual function of Janus in the opening of the Porta Ianualis or Porta Belli.

25|$|Research {{suggests}} that sleep patterns vary significantly across cultures.

The primary difference appears to be that pre-light cultures have more broken-up sleep patterns. For example, people without artificial light <b>might</b> <b>go</b> to sleep far sooner after the sun sets, but then wake up several times throughout the night, punctuating their sleep with periods of wakefulness, perhaps lasting several hours.|$|E
