40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{phenotypic}} {{actions of}} the oligotriche gene mutation on testicular function have not been elucidated, although {{it is known that}} male mice homozygous for the mutation are infertile. In the present study, the effect of the oligotriche gene mutation on mouse testicular function was analyzed by comparing normal and mutant mice. Spermatogenesis was analyzed by enumerating germ cells in seminiferous tubules at specific stages of spermatogenesis and by electron microscopy. Steroidogenic potential was estimated by radioimmunometric determination of testosterone secreted by testes perfused in vitro. Parallel studies were completed for male mice homozygous for the quaking gene mutation, a mutation known to cause <b>male</b> mouse <b>sterility</b> by disrupting sperm tail development. The experimental results suggest that the oligotriche and quaking gene mutations interfere with sperm tail formation by different mechanisms. Testicular steroidogenesis was not affected by either gene mutation. The results provide the first evidence that the oligotriche gene mutation induces <b>male</b> mouse <b>sterility</b> by effecting the complete absence of a sperm tail. This phenotypic action is {{different from that of the}} quaking gene mutation...|$|R

40|$|Document Type : Book ChapterPlants possess {{compartmentalized}} genomes {{that are}} {{distributed in the}} nucleus and in two organelles: the mitochondria (mt) and plastids (pt). The crucial functions of these organelles require interaction between products encoded by the organelle genome and the nucleus. Hence, coadaptation contributes {{to the evolution of}} plant genomes, leading to a cooperative coevolution between interacting gene products that are encoded in different compartments. In addition, the different modes of inheritance between the Mendelian nuclear genes and uniparental organelles create a genomic conflict that also contributes to shape the evolution of some mt and nuclear genes: those involved in cytonuclear <b>male</b> <b>sterilities.</b> Pentatricopeptide repeat proteins {{have been involved in the}} evolution of the mt-nuclear conflict, but are also suspected to participate in the cooperative coadaptation between the nuclear compartment and organelle genomes. Several lines of evidence indicate that organelle genetic variations contribute to plant adaptation to their environment. So far, very few studies have identified potentially adaptive organelle variants. Nevertheless, it is very likely that cytonuclear coadaptation interferes with cytoplasmic adaptation to the environment.

Concurrently, overlapping-generation laboratory populations similar to those being modeled were initialized with various starting transgene proportions, and the subsequent proportions of transgenic individuals in populations were determined weekly until the transgene disappeared. The specific transgene being tested contained a homing endonuclease gene expressed in testes, I-PpoI, that cleaves the ribosomal DNA and results in complete <b>male</b> sexual <b>sterility</b> with no effect on female fertility.

40|$|Haldane's rule {{states that}} when one sex of hybrids shows {{sterility}} or inviability {{it tends to be}} the heterogametic sex. This pattern is considered a fundamental law of speciation, and is known to be caused by several separate mechanisms. One such mechanism may be the divergence at loci affecting sex chromosome meiotic drive. Cyrtodiopsis dalmanni and C. whitei are sister species of stalk-eyed fly found in Southeast Asia and in which a sizable proportion of wild-caught males produce female-biased broods due to X chromosome meiotic drive. I cross multiple populations of these two species and use QTL mapping and DNA sequencing techniques to test three predictions of the meiotic drive hypothesis of Haldane's rule. In chapter 1, my results show that <b>male</b> hybrid <b>sterility</b> is the fastest-evolving form of reproductive isolation in these species, consistent with Haldane's rule. In chapter 2, I show that DNA sequence evolution is consistent with a pattern of repeated selective sweeps associated with X-linked meiotic drive. In chapter 3, I report the discovery of autosomal suppressors of drive, a Y-linked suppressor, a cryptic (suppressed) driver, an inviability effect of drive, and several QTL for sterility and one QTL for male-biased progeny sex ratios. The suppressors and cryptic driver support the conclusion, from chapter 2, that meiotic drive and suppressors have evolved repeatedly in response to each other. The sterility and sex ratio QTL did not map to the same genetic marker interval, which is not necessarily inconsistent with the drive hypothesis if sufficient time has elapsed to allow additional sterility loci to evolve. Overall, these results provide several lines of support for the meiotic drive hypothesis of Haldane's rule, which is rapidly gaining traction among researchers in the field of speciation. This conclusion suggests that attempts should be made to identify specific genes affecting meiotic drive and <b>male</b> hybrid <b>sterility</b> in Cyrtodiopsis...|$|R

Cytoplasmic <b>male</b> <b>sterility</b> {{has now been}} identified in over 150 plant species.

40|$|A new {{example of}} ``hybrid dysgenesis'' has been {{demonstrated}} in the F(1) progeny of crosses between two different strains of Drosophila virilis. The dysgenic traits were observed only in hybrids obtained when wild-type females (of the Batumi strain 9 from Georgia, USSR) were crossed to males from a marker strain (the long-established laboratory strain, strain 160, carrying recessive markers on all its autosomes). The phenomena observed include high frequencies of <b>male</b> and female <b>sterility,</b> <b>male</b> recombination, chromosomal nondisjunction, transmission ratio distortion {{and the appearance of}} numerous visible mutations at different loci in the progeny of dysgenic crosses.

However, in contrast to the P-M and I-R dysgenic systems in D. melanogaster, in D. virilis the highest level of sterility (95 - 98 %) occurs at 23 - 25 °. Several of the mutations isolated from the progeny of dysgenic crosses (e. g., singed) proved to be unstable and reverted to wild type.

These results are compared to previous data on proteins and karyotypes. Estimates of genetic differentiation based on F- and R-statistics are much lower for autosomal microsatellites than for all other genetic markers. We show by simulations that this discrepancy stems mainly from the high mutation rate of microsatellite markers for F-statistics and from deviations from a single-step mutation model for R-statistics.
