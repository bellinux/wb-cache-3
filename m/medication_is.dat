5|$|A {{state may}} place {{the burden on}} the {{defendant}} has to prove incompetence by the preponderance of the evidence, but the state cannot require the defendant to prove incompetence by a higher standard, such as clear and convincing evidence. The right to competence cannot be waived because waivers of constitutional rights are required to be knowing and voluntary. The state may involuntarily medicate the defendant in order to make her competent for trial, but only after factual showings that there is a state interest in punishment (as opposed to civil confinement), that the <b>medication</b> <b>is</b> likely to result in competence, and that the <b>medication</b> <b>is</b> necessary to restore competence.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} {{treatment of}} epilepsy is anticonvulsant medications, possibly for the person's entire life. The choice of anticonvulsant {{is based on}} seizure type, epilepsy syndrome, other medications used, other health problems, and the person's age and lifestyle. A single <b>medication</b> <b>is</b> recommended initially; {{if this is not}} effective, switching to a single other <b>medication</b> <b>is</b> recommended. Two medications at once is recommended only if a single medication does not work. In about half, the first agent is effective; a second single agent helps in about 13% and a third or two agents at the same time may help an additional 4%. About 30% of people continue to have seizures despite anticonvulsant treatment.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{symptoms}} are deficits of normal emotional responses or of other thought processes, {{and are less}} responsive to medication. They commonly include flat expressions or little emotion, poverty of speech, inability to experience pleasure, lack of desire to form relationships, and lack of motivation. Negative symptoms appear to contribute more to poor quality of life, functional ability, and the burden on others than positive symptoms do. People with greater negative symptoms often {{have a history of}} poor adjustment before the onset of illness, and response to <b>medication</b> <b>is</b> often limited.|$|E
50|$|Few <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> {{approved}} {{specifically for}} schizoaffective disorder. In general, <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> chosen to reduce symptoms of psychosis and mood disorder.|$|R
50|$|Second-line or third-line <b>medications</b> can <b>be</b> added if the {{first-line}} medications do {{not control}} the tremor. Second-line <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> the anti-epileptics topiramate, gabapentin (as monotherapy) and levetiracetam, or benzodiazepines like alprazolam. Third-line <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> clozapine and mirtazapine.|$|R
50|$|Generally {{after three}} <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> tried, {{different}} treatment should be considered. It {{should also be}} noted that some <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> harmful to those with this syndrome and can increase seizures.|$|R
5|$|Pharmacological {{treatment}} {{can help to}} manage psychiatric or behavioral problems. <b>Medication</b> <b>is</b> also used to control post-traumatic epilepsy; however the preventive use of anti-epileptics is not recommended. In those cases where the person is bedridden due to a reduction of consciousness, has to remain in a wheelchair because of mobility problems, or has any other problem heavily impacting self-caring capacities, caregiving and nursing are critical.|$|E
5|$|Prevention at the {{population}} level {{has been with}} the universal salt iodization. Hypothyroidism can be treated with levothyroxine. The dose is adjusted according to symptoms and normalization of the thyroxine and TSH levels. Thyroid <b>medication</b> <b>is</b> safe in pregnancy. While a certain amount of dietary iodine is important, excessive amounts can worsen certain types of hypothyroidism.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine as a {{manufactured}} <b>medication</b> <b>is</b> {{sold under}} the trade names Intropin, Dopastat, and Revimine, among others. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is most commonly used as a stimulant drug {{in the treatment of}} severe low blood pressure, slow heart rate, and cardiac arrest. It is especially important in treating these in newborn infants. It is given intravenously. Since the half-life of dopamine in plasma is very short—approximately one minute in adults, two minutes in newborn infants and up to five minutes in preterm infants—it is usually given in a continuous intravenous drip rather than a single injection.|$|E
50|$|Acid <b>medication</b> <b>are,</b> {{because of}} pH partition, {{secreted}} {{to a higher}} extent when urine is basic. In the same way, basic <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> secreted to a higher extent when urine is acidic.|$|R
50|$|Medications: There <b>are</b> no <b>medications</b> {{available}} to directly treat CDD. Antipsychotic <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> {{used to treat}} severe behavior problems like aggressive stance and repetitive behavior patterns. Anticonvulsant <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> used to control seizures.|$|R
50|$|<b>Medications</b> can <b>be</b> {{very helpful}} {{in the long term}} {{treatment}} of polysubstance dependence. <b>Medications</b> <b>are</b> a useful aid in helping to prevent or reducing drug cravings. Another benefit of <b>Medications</b> <b>is</b> helping to preventing relapse. Since drug addictions effect brain functioning, medications assist in returning to normal brain functioning. Polysubstance abusers require medications for each substance they are addicted to, as the current medications do not treat all addictions simultaneously. <b>Medications</b> <b>are</b> a useful aid in treatments, but are not effective when they are the sole treatment method.|$|R
5|$|Most {{pituitary}} hormones can {{be replaced}} indirectly by administering {{the products of the}} effector glands: hydrocortisone (cortisol) for adrenal insufficiency, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, testosterone for male hypogonadism, and estradiol for female hypogonadism (usually with a progestogen to inhibit unwanted effects on the uterus). Growth hormone is available in synthetic form, but needs to be administered parenterally (by injection). Antidiuretic hormone {{can be replaced}} by desmopressin (DDAVP) tablets or nose spray. Generally, the lowest dose of the replacement <b>medication</b> <b>is</b> used to restore wellbeing and correct the deranged results, as excessive doses would cause side-effects or complications. Those requiring hydrocortisone are usually instructed to increase their dose in physically stressful events such as injury, hospitalization and dental work as these are times when the normal supplementary dose may be inadequate, putting the patient at risk of adrenal crisis.|$|E
5|$|No <b>medication</b> <b>is</b> {{approved}} {{to halt the}} progression of the initial injury to secondary injury. The variety of pathological events presents opportunities to find treatments that interfere with the damage processes. Neuroprotection methods to decrease secondary injury, {{have been the subject}} of interest follows TBI. However, trials to test agents that could halt these cellular mechanisms have met largely with failure. For example, interest existed in cooling the injured brain; however, a 2014 Cochrane review did not find enough evidence to see if it was useful or not. A 2016 review found that maintaining a normal or low normal temperature appeared useful in adults but not children. High quality evidence to support targeted temperature management below normal however is poor.|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immune suppression tends to be less effective than in other autoimmune diseases. Prednisolone (a glucocorticoid or steroid) suppresses the immune response, and the steroid-sparing agent azathioprine may replace it once therapeutic effect has been achieved. IVIG may be used {{with a degree of}} effectiveness. Plasma exchange (or plasmapheresis), the removal of plasma proteins such as antibodies and replacement with normal plasma, may provide improvement in acute severe weakness. Again, plasma exchange is less effective than in other related conditions such as myasthenia gravis, and additional immunosuppressive <b>medication</b> <b>is</b> often needed.|$|E
30|$|Low {{adherence}} to comorbidity <b>medication</b> <b>was</b> reported by 29.5 % of patients (Table 1). Patients reporting low comorbidity <b>medication</b> <b>were</b> younger, less frequently {{covered by a}} Medicare Advantage health plan, and had a lower comorbidity level than patients more adherent to their comorbidity <b>medications.</b> There <b>were</b> no differences in comorbidity medication adherence levels by cancer type.|$|R
5000|$|Complex {{conditions}} for which <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> heavily advertised, including conditions like ADHD in adults, present a more challenging situation. Direct-to-consumer marketing of <b>medications</b> <b>is</b> widely criticized for promoting inappropriate self-diagnosis. [...] One other condition that is commonly self-diagnosed is gluten intolerance.|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} types of canine ear infections {{are caused by}} microorganisms, {{including}} yeast and bacterial infections. The most common variety of this is Malassezia pachydermatitis. Symptoms can include the dog shaking its head or scratching at its ears more frequently. The ear canal will appear inflamed, a pus-like substance will be discharged in some cases, and the ear will smell quite pungent in most cases. Treatment for the more common causes of otitis externa in dogs often includes oral antibiotics and flushing the ears with an antibacterial solution. In some cases, anti-inflammatory <b>medication</b> <b>is</b> prescribed. Some conditions can increase the chance of ear infections, including living in a humid environment and frequent swimming or bathing without adequate drying of the ear afterwards. Keeping {{the hair on the}} ears short {{can be used as a}} preventative method to ear problems.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{may include}} {{activated}} charcoal {{if the person}} presents soon after the overdose. Attempting to force the person to vomit is not recommended. If {{there is a potential}} for toxicity, the antidote acetylcysteine is recommended. The <b>medication</b> <b>is</b> generally given for at least 24 hours. Psychiatric care may be required following recovery. A liver transplant may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on low blood pH, high blood lactate, poor blood clotting, or significant hepatic encephalopathy. With early treatment liver failure is rare. Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.|$|E
5|$|<b>Medication</b> <b>is</b> {{available}} to help when symptoms interfere with functioning. The classes of medication with the most proven efficacy in treating tics—typical and atypical neuroleptics including risperidone (trade name Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), haloperidol (Haldol), pimozide (Orap) and fluphenazine (Prolixin)—can have long-term and short-term adverse effects. The antihypertensive agents clonidine (trade name Catapres) and guanfacine (Tenex) are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy, but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics. Stimulants and other medications {{may be useful in}} treating ADHD when it co-occurs with tic disorders. Drugs from several other classes of medications can be used when stimulant trials fail, including guanfacine (trade name Tenex), atomoxetine (Strattera) and tricyclic antidepressants. Clomipramine (Anafranil), a tricyclic, and SSRIs—a class of antidepressants including fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and fluvoxamine (Luvox)—may be prescribed when a Tourette's patient also has symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Several other medications have been tried, but evidence to support their use is unconvincing.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> being studied, {{including}} abatacept, MEXIS/M6S, triamcinolone, secukinumab, tralonkinumab, apremilast, botulinum toxin, INCB018424, bimatoprost, clobetasol, AS101, autologous platelet-rich plasma, topical minoxidil, and {{nitric oxide}} gel. Some of these <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> approved for other diseases, {{others are not}} available outside of studies.|$|R
5000|$|There <b>are</b> no <b>medications</b> {{that have}} <b>been</b> {{approved}} to treat autism spectrum disorder, but some <b>medications</b> may <b>be</b> prescribed off-label to treat symptoms of ASD. Antipsychotic <b>medications</b> may <b>be</b> {{used to reduce}} irritability and aggression in children with autism. Stimulant <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> used to treat symptoms of hyperactivity and inattentiveness. Antidepressant <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> occasionally prescribed to reduce the restricted and repetitive behaviors associated with autism. These drugs, such as selective serotonin uptake inhibitors, improve social interaction and self-control by reducing obsessive behavior. When used alongside psychosocial therapies, these drugs can greatly decrease the struggles of social interaction for people on the autism spectrum, although {{more research is needed}} before the <b>medications</b> can <b>be</b> safe and effective.|$|R
50|$|Most {{prescription}} <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> {{paid for}} by AISH benefits. The majority of what a doctor will prescribe, from common antibiotics, to such medications as Ritalin and Zyprexa, is covered by AISH. However, there <b>are</b> <b>medications,</b> generally, although not always, newer <b>medications,</b> that <b>are</b> {{not covered by the}} benefits. <b>Medication</b> coverage <b>is</b> decided upon by a government committee.|$|R
5|$|Pain: {{acute pain}} is mainly due to optic {{neuritis}} (with corticosteroids {{being the best}} treatment available), as well as trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign, or dysesthesias. Subacute pain is usually secondary to the disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in the same position, urinary retention, and infected skin ulcers, amongst others. Treatment will depend on cause. Chronic pain is very common and harder to treat as its most common cause is dysesthesias. Acute pain due to trigeminal neuralgia is usually successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or phenytoin. Both Lhermitte's sign and painful dysesthesias usually respond to treatment with carbamazepine, clonazepam, or amitriptyline. Sativex is approved for treatment of pain in MS in different countries, but due to its derivation from cannabis, it is currently not available in others, such as the USA. This <b>medication</b> <b>is</b> also being investigated {{for the management of}} other MS symptoms, such as spasticity, and has shown long-term safety and efficacy.|$|E
25|$|As {{anger is}} a {{psychological}} concern, treating it with <b>medication</b> <b>is</b> possible. The {{main purpose of}} the <b>medication</b> <b>is</b> to complement heal and not to complicate your healing. You need to prescribe to a doctor about your anger issues and about the medications.|$|E

Ophthalmological problems and other reasons for taking <b>medication</b> <b>were</b> not measured in this study. Percentages of master swimmers taking {{the different types of}} <b>medication</b> <b>were</b> quantified.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> useful for {{preventing}} further episodes of gout, including allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Long term <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> not recommended until {{a person has}} had two attacks of gout, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist. It is not until this point that <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> cost-effective. They are not usually started until one to two weeks after an acute flare has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack. They are often used in combination with either an NSAID or colchicine {{for the first three}} to six months.|$|R

25|$|Stimulant <b>medication</b> <b>is</b> an {{effective}} treatment for adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder although {{the response rate}} may be lower for adults than children.|$|E
25|$|Antipneumocystic <b>medication</b> <b>is</b> {{used with}} {{concomitant}} steroids {{in order to}} avoid inflammation, which causes an exacerbation of symptoms about four days after treatment begins if steroids are not used. By far the most commonly used <b>medication</b> <b>is</b> trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, but some patients are unable to tolerate this treatment due to allergies. Other medications that are used, alone or in combination, include pentamidine, trimetrexate, dapsone, atovaquone, primaquine, pafuramidine maleate (under investigation), and clindamycin. Treatment is usually for a period of about 21 days.|$|E

40|$|Background: Psychoactive medications, such as antidepressants, {{are one of}} {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} categories of drugs in the US; yet few studies have comprehensively examined the conditions for which psychoactive <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> prescribed. To our knowledge, no prior study has examined the extent to which psychoactive <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> prescribed for non-psychiatric somatic illnesses or the main types of psychiatric disorders for which psychoactive <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> being used. Objective: To examine the diagnoses for which psychiatric <b>medications</b> <b>are</b> being prescribed in the US by analysing data from a nationally representative survey of physicians. Methods: The data were obtained from the 2005 National Disease and Therapeutic Index (NDTI), a continuing survey of a US office-based panel of physicians.
