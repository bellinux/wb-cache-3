It is an one stop marketing solution firm that deals with almost every kind of marketing activities that is available right now, not only about marketing it is now dealing with HR issues and Public Relations as well. It started with Market Access Providers Limited Only but then it went bigger. Major companies in Bangladesh, Multinational companies, Local companies both are frequently working with <b>Market</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Group.</b> Television commercials, Audio Visuals for the B 2 B businesses, Events, Direct marketing and other marketing activities all are available in market access. It has connections all over the country. Market Access Provider Limited has two key departments direct marketing, Service marketing and One another linked SBU Integrated Rural marketing. They each have different playgrounds to play. They play with different issues of marketing. Direct marketing goes for direct customer interaction, direct promotions, service marketing is more of a event oriented department, it arranges event based activations whereas integrated rural works in the rural, semi urban areas where people can get little knowledge about brands. Making them aware about brands. Every marketing needs a plan, strategic planning team does planning for all the three above mentioned departments. It generates ideas and makes a proper activation plan that the operation team executes. My internship period was all about learning the strategic planning for brands, some of them were giant brands like cocacola, sprite, Airtel, Pepsodent etc. Firstly I saw whatever they were doing with those brands, then I started helping them, last phase in myinternship I started making my own planning for brands, of course my supervisors helped me to perfection or close to perfection of the planning. Brand Activation in below the line marketing has become an emerging part of marketing in recent years. All I have done with my internship report is totally based on what I felt and learnt from my internship experience in 3 months. The report consist some theories as well, apart from those, the small internet readings and experience from my internship helped me to make this report. Brand Activation is very important because it connects the target audience directly. Among the 4 Ps of marketing Brand activation play with 2 Ps Promotions and Place.

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 29). Now-a-days the dynamism of modern technologies & its pragmatic applications are almost inevitable for our day to day life style. Google is on a triumphant march for providing solutions to emerging needs & connecting people across the globe by creating virtually inter-connected world through Google Apps. Recently Google Bus Bangladesh has officially launched its journey {{in the country to}} encourage the students at college and university level to get involved in internet use through Google Apps to bag and maximize the benefits of ICT in their lives. <b>Market</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Group,</b> one of the biggest marketing agencies in Bangladesh, is event & activation partner of ‘Google Bus Bangladesh’ project campaign. This project consists of Planning team, advanced team & Trainer team for executing the entire projects to reach ultimate objectives. I have worked in the trainer team & visited various college and university campuses as an execution part of this job as well as gathering information for the internship report. The training part has been designed as an interactive session among the students & trainers starting with the audience based contents structured by the Google Bus Bangladesh team. The contents have been configured with the technical-know-how and benefits of Google apps for virtual documentations (docs, spreadsheet, and calendar), group discussions, and live video conference (Hangout), social networking (Google+), virtual data storage accessible from any device (Google drive), educative learning & entertainment through online video channel (YouTube) etc. for the students. The training session has used to be boosted up with the Quiz contest based on the contents delivered and gift for the winners. The Google Bus journey to a campus has to end up with the hands-on participation of the students in joining virtual Google plus Community. I came up with the findings that Google apps has diversified interactive virtual facilities to reduce the complexities of storing, editing and losing data or records; it has limitations due to formatting mismatch that limits data copy and paste among Google docs, Google spreadsheet & Google presentation. Moreover, Google plus community is not so popular among students like Facebook community for social networking. However, Google apps have crafted a vast window for the tech-freak emerging student community of Bangladesh. S. M. Arafatur RahmanM. Business Administratio...|$|E

In {{order to address}} this issue, we compare the main ISMU data characteristics {{with those of the}} labor Force Survey (LFS) for the North of Italy (where Lombardy is located and where most of the immigrants in Italy live, 2006 - 2008 averages) 7. The main relevant difference between ISMU and LFS is in the country of origin composition: in LFS the share of women coming from CEEC is 54 percent, 20 percentage points greater than the ISMU figure. The difference between the two sources is quite sizeable and this could raise some issues related to the external validity of the analyses. However, {{it should be noted that}} all other population characteristics are quite similar. The average schooling is 10.2 years in the LFS. The activity rate is slightly lower (65 per cent) probably due to the different definitions of working status between LFS and ISMU. More importantly the labor <b>market</b> <b>access</b> differences among <b>groups</b> are preserved, for example the NENAC group in the LFS survey still maintain a huge gap in the activity rate in comparison with CEEC group (20 percentage points).|$|R

40|$|One {{consequence}} of the proliferation of preferential trade agreements is that an increasing share of international trade {{is not subject to}} most favored nation tariffs, but rather enters <b>markets</b> through preferential <b>access.</b> The objective {{of this paper is to}} better investigate to what extent preferential <b>market</b> <b>access</b> affects bilateral trade. In doing so, the paper first provides two indices of <b>market</b> <b>access</b> conditions that take into account the complex structure of tariff preferences. One index summarizes direct <b>market</b> <b>access</b> conditions (the overall tariff faced by exports), while the other measures relative <b>market</b> <b>access</b> conditions (the overall tariff faced by exports relative to that faced by foreign competitors). Then, the paper explores the effects of preferential access on international trade by estimating a gravity model augmented by the two indices. The results indicate that both direct and relative <b>market</b> <b>access</b> conditions affect bilateral trade. Although a large majority of countries benefits from the system of preference because of improved direct <b>market</b> <b>access,</b> some countries see part of their benefits eroded, sometimes substantially, by the deterioration in their relative <b>market</b> <b>access</b> conditions. ...|$|R

Analysis is {{conducted on the}} effects of <b>market</b> <b>access</b> on two commodities in the Kenyan highlands: milk and bean seeds. Both simple and composite measures of <b>market</b> <b>access</b> are applied to spatial price formation models to create spatial price decay functions in the context of household-specific transaction costs. Composite measures of <b>market</b> <b>access</b> include negative exponential (using travel time or distance as cost) and gravity measures. The results demonstrate that the effects of <b>market</b> <b>access</b> differ significantly depending on the particular goods of interest. Simple measures of <b>market</b> <b>access</b> have the advantage of being more easily interpretable, and should therefore be preferred when communicating research outputs to the non-scientific community, especially decision-makers. The implications are that research addressing commodity-specific development questions needs to look beyond generic measures of <b>market</b> <b>access</b> and develop tailored measures that reflect the characteristics of the commodity system of interest. The analysis also demonstrates that spatial price formation can be used to generate potentially more accurate measures of unit-distance marketing costs.
