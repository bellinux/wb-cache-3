5|$|The most clues for {{a minimal}} Sudoku is {{believed}} to be 40, of which only two are known. If any clue is removed from either of these Sudokus, the puzzle would have more than one solution (and thus not be a proper Sudoku). These two Sudokus were discovered in 2014, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> after at least one programmer expressed doubts that a 40-clue minimal Sudoku would exist. In the work to find these Sudokus, other high-clue puzzles were catalogued, including more than 6,500,000,000 minimal puzzles with 36-clues. About 2600 minimal Sudokus with 39-clues were also found.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Dean Hall, an {{employee}} at Bohemia working on ARMA 3, released a massively popular mod for Arma II named DayZ, which includes zombies as the game's main enemies.

Impressed {{with the success of}} DayZ, Bohemia appointed Hall to fully capitalize on it by leading the development of a standalone DayZ video game, which ensured {{that he would not be}} limited by the restraints of Arma 2. While the main goal is to transit the mod into an entirely new game, the team also intended to add more content such as base-building and improved crafting.

5|$|In 1871, Rio Branco {{became the}} President of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) {{for the first}} time. He would become the Council's longest-serving president, and his cabinet the second longest, in Brazilian history. His {{government}} was marked by a time of economic prosperity and the enactment of several necessary reforms—though they proved to be seriously flawed. The {{most important of these}} initiatives was the Law of Free Birth, which granted freeborn status to children born to slave women. Rio Branco led the government that enacted this law, and its passage increased his popularity. However, his government was plagued by a long crisis with the Catholic Church that had resulted from the expulsion of Freemasons from its lay brotherhoods. After <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> heading the Cabinet, Rio Branco resigned in 1875. Following a long vacation in Europe, his health swiftly declined and he was diagnosed with oral cancer. Rio Branco died in 1880 and was widely mourned throughout the country.
