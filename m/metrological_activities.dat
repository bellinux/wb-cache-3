40|$|The {{interest}} of the metrology community towards chemistry started quite late, compared to “classical” metrology. In chemistry there were many <b>metrological</b> <b>activities</b> (for ex. determination of atomic weights, validation of analytical methods) carried out outside the metrological organizations. The mole, the unit of amount of substance, {{was introduced in the}} International System of Units only in 1971. The growing need to assure accuracy, stability, comparability in time and space of chemical measurements led to a better rationalisation and control of the <b>metrological</b> <b>activities,</b> leading to a convergence of the international collaborations inside the Metre Convention {{at the beginning of the}} 90 s with the establishment of CCQM. At European level, in 1991 the Amount of Substance sector within EUROMET (now EURAMET, the European Association of National Metrology Institutes) was founded. In the following years the Technical Committee of Metrology in Chemistry (TC-MC) was established as a Joint EURAMET-Eurachem Technical Committee chaired by EURAMET. TC-MC is concerned with primary methods and reference materials for chemical measurements and research in metrology to support different sectors in chemistry. The activities undertaken in its four Technical Subcommittees range from organic and inorganic chemical analysis to electrochemistry and gas analysis. The work is carried out within projects in the framework of both the usual metrological approach (i. e. organisation of measurement comparisons to establish the mutual agreement among European National Metrology Institutes and Designated Institutes) and in the European programmes on metrology (EMRP and EMPIR), where a very successful participation of NMIs and DIs active in the chemical field has been recorded...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} activity {{described in this}} thesis {{is concerned with the}} development and characterization of a standard for thermal energy and with the study of innovative applications and measuring solutions for smart heat metering. After an initial overview on {{the current state of the}} art and regulations for direct thermal energy measurement devices and heat accounting systems, the activities related to the development and the metrological characterization of the Italian standard of thermal energy, carried out at the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRIM), are presented and discussed. INRIM, according to its responsibilities as National Metrological Institute (NMI), realizes the primary standards for the basic and derived units of the International System of Units (SI) and ensures the operation and maintenance of such standards, providing the national metrological traceability to the SI. Along this line, the development and the characterization of the national standard for thermal energy is fundamental in order to ensure the metrological traceability of thermal energy measurements, which is achieved through an unbroken sequence of calibration steps, each characterized by its corresponding uncertainty. Such a <b>metrological</b> <b>activity</b> is essential for the provision of accurate measurements of the thermal energy exchanged by heat conveying fluids in a number of applications, contributing significantly to the improvement of the efficiency of energy systems and processes. The INRIM national standard for thermal energy has gone through deep changes since 2011, when extensive renovation works have been planned and carried out to improve its features and performances. Thus, a metrological analysis of the system was required to assess the quality of measurements, through the investigation of all the uncertainty contributions affecting the main measurement outputs of the system: water mass and volume flow rate and thermal energy. In particular, the activities related to the development and characterization of the national standard for thermal energy were focused on the set up of a new measurement system for testing and calibrating direct heat meters in experimental conditions close to the actual operating ones, the automatization of the whole measuring process and the evaluation of the uncertainty associated to the INRIM thermal energy standard. According to the Supplement 1 of the Guide to the expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM), the evaluation of the uncertainty has been carried out by means of the Monte Carlo method, which allows evaluating the probability distribution of the measurands from the probability density functions associated to the input quantities of the measurement model. In order to evaluate and confirm the metrological capabilities of the INRIM measurement system and method with respect to other NMIs' laboratories worldwide, a pilot study on the comparison between national standards for thermal energy has been organized with the PTB Heat and Vacuum department in Berlin (Working Group 7. 52, New Methods for Thermal Energy Measurement). Such an activity has been detailed from the design of the test plan for the comparison, to the discussion of the results of the first round of tests carried out at INRIM. The experimental plan has allowed observing and analyzing the effect of fluid temperature on the volume flow measurement provided by the electromagnetic flow meter used as transfer standard for the comparison. Since flow meters are typically calibrated at ambient flow conditions, understanding and quantifying the temperature effect on volume flow measurement is important, in particular, for heat metering applications. Furthermore, the analyses of two innovative measuring solutions for the non-invasive flow rate and temperature measurement in pipe flows, which can be effectively applied to thermal energy measurement, are presented and discussed. The first is related to the combined measurement of flow rate and temperature in liquid pipe flows by the clamp-on transit-time ultrasonic technique. In particular, the feasibility and the accuracy of such a non-intrusive measuring solution for the simultaneous measurement of flow rate and temperature has been analyzed by modelling the ultrasound propagation in a typical clamp-on sensor for a wide set of simulated measuring conditions. From the results of the numerical simulation, it has been possible to observe how the temperature dependent acoustic refraction of ultrasound beams can affect the accuracy of these sensors, in particular, in terms of non-intrusive temperature measurement. The second measuring solution is related to the proposal of a direct heat metering technique, based on the non-invasive measurement of the fluid flow rate circulating through a generic heat exchanger, exploiting the correlation between fluid velocity and internal heat transfer coefficient in forced pipe flows. A preliminary thermal fluid dynamic analysis has been carried out for different simulated operating conditions, in order to get a first evaluation of the feasibility and the accuracy of this non-invasive measuring technique. One of the most important application fields for heat metering devices is the measurement of thermal energy consumptions in buildings. In such a context, the fair heat cost allocation among the residents of multi-apartments and multi-purpose buildings with central heating systems, based on the accurate measurement of the actual individual thermal energy consumptions, represents an effective tool to promote energy saving and improve energy efficiency, as declared by the European Directive 2012 / 27 /EU, recently implemented in Italy by the Decree 102 / 2014. Anyway, in many cases, i. e. in outdated central heating systems with vertical hot water distribution networks (rising main central heating plant configuration), the accurate measurement of individual thermal energy consumptions by means of the measures of flow rate and temperature difference of the heat conveying fluid (direct heat metering) may be neither feasible nor affordable because of installation and economic constraints. In these situations, indirect methods for the estimation of individual heat consumptions or innovative heat accounting solutions should be applied, providing their compliancy to at least one of the current technical standards for heat metering or heat cost allocation. Along this line, a novel heat cost allocation method for apartment buildings has been proposed and validated. Such a heat accounting method is particularly suitable for central heating systems characterized by room heating radiators connected to vertical hot water distribution networks and provides the indirect estimation of individual thermal energy consumptions without the need of temperature measurements at radiator heating surfaces. The proposed heat cost allocation method is based on the hydraulic modelling of hot water distribution networks, which allows estimating the water flow rates circulating through each radiator from the measurement of the overall water flow rate in the circuit and the corresponding head loss. The novel indirect heat accounting method has been validated at the INRIM central heating system test facility, a unique laboratory, consisting of 40 fully-instrumented water radiators equipped with a SI-traceable direct heat meter each and connected to an automatically reconfigurable hydraulic circuit, which allows testing indirect heat cost allocation methods in experimental conditions very close to those in the field...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide an economic perspective to those involved in public financing of the national metrology infrastructure. Whereas justifications for subsidising the national <b>metrological</b> <b>activities</b> are often historically based, we raise the importance of economic considerations, which could be used during prioritisation. The expenditure in measurement and metrology infrastructure of European countries are compared to economic indicators for quality of life. Various proxies are used, such as measuring instruments sale (for measurement infrastructure) and data from the BIPM's KCDB (as a proxy for national standards). As the EU Internal Market also holds for the provision of metrological services, the paper exposes possible trends regarding public financing to the sector. JRC. D. 4 -Isotope measurement...|$|E

40|$|About 30 years ago, in the {{industry}} {{for the production of}} semiconductors, started the race for the reduction of the dimensions of several electronic components. The trend followed the well-known Moore’s law and the dimensions of the chips halved every 18 months. The effect of reduction of the dimensions of products and components involved other scientific and technological fields. Products with micrometric dimensions, i. e. with one fundamental dimension in the range of micrometres, are presents in different domains including mechanics, biology, physics and medicine. The micro engineering concerns with the design, the realization and the industrialization of these products with micrometric dimensions. A fundamental phase of micro engineering is product/process quality control and related measurements. The metrology at micro scale is part of the manufacturing chain of micro products during the design, with the definition of the specifications, during the manufacturing, for the control of the process and in the final phase for the verification of specifications. The measurement of the dimensions and geometries at micrometric level is nowadays in evolution: several aspects, including the development of instruments and measurement techniques, need more studies. The thesis here presented wants to contribute increasing the knowledge in the field of micro metrology and to provide useful solutions to improve the dimensional and geometrical characterization of micro products. Although, the research has been developed to be valid in general, it is included {{as an integral part of}} the European project “CellDiaSp”. The project, in collaboration with international partners, provides for the realization of a microfluidic platform for cells analysis. The <b>metrological</b> <b>activities,</b> required by the project, are needed to characterize the dimensions and the geometry of prototypes, mould inserts, masters and finite products, in order to guarantee the respect of the specifications and the functionality of the final product. The first phase of the research deals with the study of the state of the art of metrology and of the relevant measurement techniques that can be used at micro scale. Successively the application of some of these techniques to the replication processes has been studied. These processes, such as micro injection moulding, are used to obtain mass production and a cost reduction. It has been considered the possibility to measure the components presents in the process of replication, that is the inserts and the replicated parts and to evaluate the quality of the replication process through the calculation of single parameters such as parameters used in the measurement of surfaces. It resulted that this is possible only in few specific cases and that it is preferable to perform a complete three dimensional characterization of the dimensions and geometries of the product of replication. It has been decided to focus the attention on two typologies of instruments: the scanning probe microscopes and the optical profilometers. These instruments are adapted to the measurement of the parts to be investigated within the project and, moreover, they are the best candidates to be implemented as coordinate measuring instruments, even if they were originally developed as surface measurement instruments. The problem of “drift”, an effect that reduces the accuracy of the measurements performed through atomic force microscopes, has been treated. The causes of the phenomenon have been identified and solutions to the reduction of this error have been provided. In order to obtain coordinate measurements from the atomic force microscopes and from the optical profilometer, a new technique for the data analysis has been developed. The new methodology is presented applied to a case study of a microfluidic channel measured through optical profilometry. The technique is inspired by the international standards in the field of geometrical product specification and verification, with particular reference to coordinate metrology. However, these standards can’t be directly applied to product with micrometric dimensions and they require new solutions for the analysis of the data. A dedicated software has been developed to treat the data, acquired through a confocal microscope, both as image and as point cloud, taking advantage of both approaches and related representation. Specific procedures of filtration and thresholding have been developed to perform the extraction of the points and the association of the geometrical features for the evaluation of dimensions and geometries of the sample. The developed software provides a semi-automatic and repeatable way for the coordinate measurement of micrometric components. Finally, the developed technique has been validated using a case study: the measurements of microfluidic channels with cylindrical section used in the realization of peristaltic pumps...|$|E
