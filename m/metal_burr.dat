40|$|Abstract. Friction welding of {{dissimilar}} materials, Ni-base superalloy IN 713 LC and oil-quench plus tempered AISI 4140 steel, was investigated. Friction welding {{was carried}} out with various process variables such as friction pressure and time. The quality of welded joints was tested by applying bending stresses in an appropriate jig. Microstructures of the heat-affected zone (HAZ) were investigated along with micro-hardness tests over the friction weld joints. DEFORM- 2 D FE code was used to simulate the effect of welding variables in friction welding process on the distributions of the state variables such as strain, strain rate and temperature. The formation of the <b>metal</b> <b>burr</b> during the friction welding process was successfully simulated, and the temperature distribution in the heat-affected zone indicated a good agreement with the variation of the microstructures in the HAZ...|$|E

50|$|Mechanical {{deburring}} is a deburring {{process that}} either mechanically grinds a <b>burr</b> off of <b>metal</b> or rolls {{the edge of}} dangerous slit or sheared <b>metal</b> <b>burrs</b> into itself. Rolled mechanical deburring was first developed in the 1960s by Walter W. Gauer from Gauer Metal Product, Inc. {{as a means to}} speed up the process of hand deburring strips of metal that were used in bakery racks.|$|R
50|$|The clicker's knife {{regularly}} needed sharpening, {{which was}} done with an implement called a rap stick.To use a rap stick, a right-handed operator would hold it in the left hand, resting the stick on the workbench for support, stroking the blade rapidly but gently {{back and forth on}} the abrasive surface to maintain a sharp edge whilst hand-cutting, in a similar fashion to a butcher's knife and sharpening steel. The knife blade shown is a lighter medical item but approximates the shape of a clicker's knife blade, fitting into a comfortable wooden handle with screw-activated jaws. The main surface is emery cloth wrapped over the edge to form a round section where the curved blade can nestle and be sharpened; the top edge is sharper and square in cross-section, with a fine-grain aluminium oxide abrasive strip used for tip-sharpening. On the reverse side is a heavy-leather smooth strop, to address any <b>metal</b> <b>burrs</b> left by the abrasive process.|$|R
40|$|Machining is {{a process}} {{implying}} extremely high coupled thermo-mechanical stresses. The workpiece mechanical properties decrease with the temperature generated during the process and that temperature has a direct influence on wear intensity undergone by the tool. In {{the case of a}} drilling operation, the temperature generated by the cutting process can lead to <b>metal</b> <b>burr</b> formation and/or composite matrix degradation by burning. When these two materials are used {{in the form of a}} sandwich-type stacking, the temperature attained in the metallic part can cause new defects such as: i) a difference between the diameters measured in each material and ii) organic matrix damages due to heat diffusion from the metal towards the CFRP layer. Temperature reached at the tool/workpiece interface is difficult to measure during drilling operation, due to its enclosed configuration; numerical simulation is therefore a good alternative to access to this information. The purpose of this study is to develop and carry out numerical simulations in order to estimate the workpiece thermal field generated during drilling. The simulations are validated by comparing simulated and measured temperatures at 4 mm from the holes wall. This method is applied to evaluate thermal field generated during drilling (with chip removing cycles) of CFRP/Aluminum alloy stacks. The influence of the drilling kinematics on the workpiece thermal field is also investigated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Burr {{often comes}} into being in <b>metal</b> cutting. <b>Burr</b> not only lowers the product quality, but also {{increases}} {{the cost of}} product and prolongs the production lead time, which has a strong impact on machining operation. Therefore, the key factors influencing milling burr formation are deeply analyzed and the method and technology are discussed to diminish and control milling burr based on the overall process from structure design to manufacture, which is important and valuable for theory and practical application...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{inadequacy}} in measures at many construction sites in Turkey, approximately 400 workers died {{and hundreds of}} workers become permanently disabled in occupational accidents. Occupational accidents cause serious financial loss for both {{the company and the}} country economies. This study is conducted to analyze causes and results of occupational accidents at a construction site in Istanbul-Turkey. Research data consists of the accident statistics of a construction site in Istanbul, which is obtained by using “Retrospective Cohort” method. In this study, causes and results of occupational accidents, which occurred in the construction site, are investigated. The main reasons for accident occurrence are “being hit by dashing and flitting objects”, “being hit by objects”, “falling objects ” and “being stung by something”. As a result of occupational accidents, injuries occurred in the form of incision, exposure to <b>metal</b> <b>burrs,</b> contusion, transient loss of vision, trauma and perforation. Eye, finger, foot and hand injuries are the most common accidents. The majority of occupational accidents occur on Mondays, in summer months and between the hours 16. 00 - 18. 00. The most important reason of occupational accidents is “unsafe behaviours ” with a ratio of 67 %, which is defined as not to obey the rules although the necessary occupational safety measures are provided. 312 work-day losses occurred in the construction sit...|$|R
40|$|Burr {{formation}} is common sheet <b>metal</b> defect and <b>Burr</b> control / deburring {{is an important}} issue for industrialist and engineers. It is produced in all shearing & cutting operations. In sheet <b>metal</b> parts <b>burr</b> is usual but after a specified limit it takes a form of defect. This leads to rework and quality problem of part. So controlling this defect is the issue of quality as well so a study of all relevant factors is done in this paper, individually. This paper describes that what are the possible causes & how can we prevent it. Except die & punch clearances, there are still many factors which affect the burr formation. Now, when CAD/CAM software is in use, it is not a very critical task to maintain a proper clearance accordingly. As all the sheet metal industries are heavily affected by burr problem, indicating the study of all the possible causes and remedies. This paper also clears that what practices can increase the tool life & how long we produce “burr free” parts. It includes the selection of the best materials and methods for „press tools‟, „tool design review‟, “machine selection ” etc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The plastic {{analysis}} software DEFORM {{was used}} to simulate the blanking process of <b>metal</b> plastic without <b>burr.</b> Based on theory of the rigid FEM, the geometry model used for blanking with a negative clearance was established. The facts of influence {{the quality of the}} blanking work pieces were analyzed and concluded, at the same time, the parameters were indicated {{to improve the quality of}} the blanking work pieces. Through the experiment, the blanking load was measured with different clearance, thickness and material in group. The reciprocity between these facts was analyzed and the clearance was optimized. After the blanking load was regress analysis, the coefficient of the load and these facts were researched. Using quality analysis of the work pieces in the experiment, the thickness and the material were obtained which were suitable for blanking of <b>metal</b> plastic without <b>burr.</b> The reactions which were used to separate the metal were studied, which offered thereunder for proper remaining based on the better quality and smaller blanking load...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{incidence}} of periprosthetic fractures of the acetabulum {{associated with a}} total hip arthroplasty is relatively low but may be increasing. Treatment options depend upon {{the stability of the}} prosthesis. In this case, we report an unusual fracture pattern where a large portion of posterior column remained osseointegrated to a displaced uncemented acetabular component and removal of the cup would have resulted in massive structural bone loss and potential pelvic discontinuity. A <b>metal</b> cutting <b>burr</b> was used to create additional screw holes in the cup to allow us to retain the original implant and also obtain fixation of the fracture. The patient had a good outcome at one year with a healed fracture, stable implant, and excellent function. To our knowledge, this technique has not been previously described and offers surgeons an approach to fix these challenging fractures...|$|R
40|$|Gear marking is a print {{defect in}} flexography. It {{appears as a}} uniformly spaced pattern of lateral {{alternating}} dark and light bands along the web length corresponding to the distance between gear teeth. A comprehensive definition characterizes gear marking as a regular pattern attributable to <b>metal</b> <b>burrs,</b> nicks, debris, or other flaws that lead to unsmooth movement somewhere in the mechanical system of the press. Gear marking {{can be caused by}} a multitude of different factors. In most cases, gear marking results from more than one phenomenon. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate some factors that were expected to contribute to both the causes and the severity of flexographic gear marking. The factors studied (independent variables) included plate hardness, and surface speed differential between the plate image area and the substrate when gear mark severity was the dependent variable of the study. The test target were designed and printed on the RIT 2 ̆ 7 s Mark Andy 4120 System narrow-web press. To study the effect of plate hardness, three plate types with different hardness, 40 Shore A, 50 Shore A, and 60 Shore A, were used. To study the effect of surface speed differential, two types of stickybacks, 0. 015 inch and 0. 020 inch, were used to create variations in surface speed differentials. Six pressruns were performed; the first three pressruns were of three plate hardness mounted on 0. 015 -inch stickybacks and the others were of three plate hardness mounted on 0. 020 -inch stickybacks. A group of thirty observers at the Rochester Institute of Technology were asked to participate in press sheet visual evaluation by ranking six sample press sheets in terms of gear mark severity. The Verity IA software was used to measure the horizontal bar defect indices on sample sheets of six pressruns for the quantitative analysis of gear mark severity. The results indicated that plate hardness and differential in surface speed affected the gear mark severity in flexography significantly. A lower plate hardness will produce more noticeable in gear marking than a higher one. A higher differential in surface speed will produce more noticeable in gear marking than a lower differential...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In sheet <b>metal</b> {{processes}} the <b>burrs</b> {{cannot be}} completely eliminated {{during the process}} but can be minimized by optimization of the process parameters. Hence the deburring often becomes an essential secondary operation. Most of the deburring operations are hand-made and therefore several manufacturers tend to eliminate these tedious and labor-intensive operations due to time and cost issues. Moreover, clamping problems can arise which, together with the deburring forces, can induce dimension alterations and local deformations, particularly for thin sheets. Barrel finishing is an old technique commonly used to improve the surface roughness of complicated parts, but can find interesting applications also in the deburring. Aim of this work is to present an experimental investigation on the deburring of sheet metal performed by barreling. A technological model has been developed {{in order to assess}} the height of the burr {{as a function of the}} initial burr and of the working time...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} pixels on {{displays}} and semiconductors {{is directly related}} to the surface quality of the patterned <b>metal</b> mask used. <b>Burrs</b> generated on the patterned metal mask can degrade the quality of pixels on microelectronic devices during the deposition process. In this study, experimental observations of abrasive deburring along with large pulsed electron beam (LPEB) irradiation were performed to evaluate the deburring effects on patterned metal masks. Numerical modeling of LPEB irradiation approximately predicted melting depths and the experimental studies revealed limitations in the size of burrs removed by LPEB irradiation. Thus a LPEB-assisted hybrid deburring process was developed to eliminate <b>burrs</b> of <b>metal</b> masks regardless of their size. The size of burrs remaining after the LPEB-assisted hybrid deburring process was reduced to approximately 7. 2 μm which was much less than the results of abrasive deburring alone (38. 01 μm). The burr size distribution was reduced by 85 % and surface roughness (Ra) was decreased from 640 nm to 121 nm, indicating a uniform surface texture. close...|$|R
