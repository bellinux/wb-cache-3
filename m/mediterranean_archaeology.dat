25|$|The {{eruption}} of the Thera volcano provides a possible time marker for the region. A large eruption, {{it would have}} sent a plume of ash directly over Anatolia and filled the sea in the area with floating pumice. This pumice appeared in Egypt, apparently via trade. Current excavations in the Levant may also add to the timeline. The exact date of the volcanic eruption {{has been the subject}} of strong debate, with dates ranging between 1628 and 1520 BCE. Radiocarbon dating has placed it at between 1627BCE and 1600BCE with a 95% degree of probability. Archaeologist Kevin Walsh, accepting the radiocarbon dating, suggests a possible date of 1628 and believes this to be the most debated event in <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>archaeology.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The site {{comprises}} a large main tell and 4 smaller mounds, together covering about 38 hectares with {{a height}} of around 30 meters. The main tell consists primarily of Mittani, Akkadian, Early Dynastic, and Ninevite 5 layers with the later two including monumental buildings. The initial excavation of Tell Arbid was performed by a British Museum team led by M.E.L. Mallowan. The operation ran from 1934 to 1936.

A survey was done at the site in the 1990s by Bertille Lyonnet of the Centre National de Recherches Scientifiques in Paris.

40|$|This chapter critiques the {{currently}} embraced paradigm in <b>Mediterranean</b> surface <b>archaeology</b> of regional/settlement pattern studies – seated in flat-time functional metaphysic. As shown by Mediterranean archaeologists, that chronotype does not deal well with either complexity or history. And, attending methods, also {{as demonstrated by}} Mediterranean archaeologists, do not consistently accommodate or satisfactorily assign meaning to the varied archaeological landscape. But another formational metaphysic exists and seems better to comprehend the complex, historical world and to acknowledge landscape variation. This chapter argues for approaches to the Mediterranean landscape that accept and embrace a time perspectivism...|$|R
40|$|The Hidden Landscapes {{project began}} in 2005 {{and focuses on}} biases in <b>Mediterranean</b> Landscape <b>Archaeology.</b> The project aims to study and reveal so called Hidden landscapes, which have been so far {{unrecorded}} and undetected, such as uplands and mountains in Italy. The system of settlements and land use is strongly related {{to the past and}} main anthropogenic and geomorphologic processes forming the landscape. Therefore, a dynamic and process based model for landscape dynamics of Mediterranean mountainous areas is developed by University Utrecht (the Calibrian Erosion model, Caleros). Caleros is applied for a pilot area in Northern Calabria, the Contrada Maddalena, wherefore model performance is measured. A detailed parameterization is performed for different soil physical-, climate-, and PFT dependent- parameters, using approximate data, field- and sample-measurements and conditional simulation. Given the complex and strong interactions between man, vegetation, hydrology, climate and soil, a dynamic vegetation module is implemented. Model performance is examined by a validation of LAI outcome with NDVI measurements and by a test run, where patterns in vegetation become clear...|$|R
40|$|Underwater <b>archaeology</b> in the <b>Mediterranean</b> {{should be}} based on a comprehensive, deep {{knowledge}} of a wide context of cultural environment. It is impossible to carry out an in-depth study of a specific wreck or site without having an overall cultural as well as historical perspective. It is, in fact, quite clear to everybody that even the most faraway shores of the Mediterranean were connected by means of a dense network of sea routes based on a rich trade throughout the centuries. But underwater archaeology also means the chance to understand the past environment due to the possibility of detecting ancient sea shores which nowadays are found below sea level. Today underwater archaeology also means deep sea research in extraterritorial waters. This aspect of underwater archaeological research is deeply connected with legal aspects that, in the framework of the recently approved UNESCO draft regarding the protection of underwater cultural heritage, should be planned according to international cooperation. 109 Conservation Science in Cultural Heritage Sicily has a great role in <b>Mediterranean</b> underwater <b>archaeology</b> because of its history and heritage, but also because Regional Government {{plays an important role in}} international debate in this field and because in Sicily a great impulse has been given to underwater archaeology research and cultural evaluation through the Soprintendenza del Mar...|$|R

40|$|People {{and their}} {{material}} culture have {{moved across the}} Mediterranean since early prehistory. By the early first millennium BC, a crucial step change occurred, when people began to establish permanent settlements overseas and migrated in substantial numbers. This article focuses on the critical centuries of the Iron Age to examine how thinking about colonialism and migration in the Mediterranean has changed in recent decades. Because <b>Mediterranean</b> and Classical <b>archaeology</b> have always {{paid more attention to}} the ‘colonial’ settlements founded than to the people who migrated, this article begins with an examination of ‘colonial terminology’ to assess its conceptual roots and the influences of modern colonialism and nationalism. This leads to a discussion of approaches to migration and colonialism in recent decades and consideration of current postcolonial views of colonial situations and (material) culture. The article concludes with a brief survey of potential connections between migration studies and Mediterranean colonialism...|$|R
40|$|This movie, {{is based}} on the results {{provided}} by a combined research in the field of earth and archaeological sciences, which merged geology, archaeology, instrumental data and geophysical analysis, to discover how the Mediterranean sea level has changed during the last 2000 years, due to geological and global changes. The coastline exploration of the Mare Nostrum of Romans, which still show the archaeological remnants of fish tanks, harbours and quarries of roman or pre-roman age, witness the large Earth’s movements, planet in continuous evolution, whose active dynamics produce relative movements between land and sea, with subsequent impact on the human activities along the coasts. Picturesque camera records, fascinating underwater views, drawings, graphics and animations, introduce the audience along a journey through time along the coast of the <b>Mediterranean</b> between geology, <b>archaeology</b> and geophysics, to explain how the reason of the changes have been discovered and interpreted thanks to the archaeological remnants...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} few years {{geophysical}} survey has developed considerably in terms of instrumentation and image processing. Together with remote sensing and GIS, it is becoming increasingly, if still slowly, integrated into archaeological investigations in the Mediterranean. This article reviews how, and with what success, geophysical techniques [...] and, to a lesser extent, geochemical methods, aerial/satellite remote sensing and GIS [...] have been applied to <b>Mediterranean</b> (especially Greek) <b>archaeology,</b> bearing in mind the environmental constraints of the region, and the significance, diversity and number of its ancient monuments. The application of all the main techniques of geophysical survey and some geochemical methods {{to a wide range of}} archaeological targets carried out over the last 40 years is discussed critically. Current developments in instrumentation and data processing are presented, and the next generation of geophysical work, which will have to meet challenges in relation to the protection and management of cultural resources, is also considered. In view of the need to create a common platform for the preservation of cultural heritage, it is argued that geophysical prospection techniques have to become an inseparable component of the archaeological investigative process...|$|R
