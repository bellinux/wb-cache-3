40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a novel point-cloud descriptor for robust and real-time tracking of <b>multiple</b> <b>objects</b> with-out any object knowledge. Following with {{the framework of}} incremental model-free <b>multiple</b> <b>object</b> tracking from our previous work [5][7][6], 6 DoF pose of each object is firstly estimated with input point-cloud data which is then segmented according to the estimated objects, and incremental model of each object is updated from the segmented point-clouds. Here, we propose Joint Color-Spatial Descriptor (JCSD) to enhance the robustness of the pose hypothesis evaluation to the point-cloud scene in the particle filtering framework. The method outperforms widely used point-to-point comparison methods, especially in the partially occluded scene, which is frequently happened in the dynamic object manipulation cases. By means of the robust descriptor, we achieved unsupervised <b>multiple</b> <b>object</b> segmentation accuracy higher than 99 %. The model-free <b>multiple</b> <b>object</b> tracking was implemented by using a particle filtering with JCSD as a likelihood function.

The acoustic sensor mainly tracks <b>multiple</b> <b>objects,</b> and the visual sensor supports the tracking task only when the acoustic sensor has a difficulty. Several techniques based on particle filtering are used for <b>multiple</b> <b>object</b> tracking by the acoustic sensor, and the limitations of the acoustic sensor are discussed to identify the need for the visual sensor cooperation. Performance of the triggering-based cooperation by the two visual sensors is evaluated and compared with a periodic cooperation in a real environment.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{a method for}} tracking <b>multiple</b> <b>objects</b> whose number is unknown and varies during tracking. Based on preliminary results of object detection in each image which may have missing and/or false detection, the <b>multiple</b> <b>object</b> tracking method keeps a graph structure where it maintains multiple hypotheses about the number and the trajectories of the objects in the video. The image information drives the process of extending and pruning the graph, and determines the best hypothesis to explain the video. While the image-based object detection makes a local decision, the tracking process confirms and validates the detection through time, therefore, it {{can be regarded as}} temporal detection which makes a global decision across time. The <b>multiple</b> <b>object</b> tracking method gives feedbacks which are predictions of object locations to the object detection module. Therefore, the method integrates object detection and tracking tightly. The most possible hypothesis provides the <b>multiple</b> <b>object</b> tracking result. The experimental results are presented. ...|$|R

40|$|Several daily {{activities}} like walking {{in a crowded}} street depend on our ability to process <b>multiple</b> <b>objects</b> simultaneously. According to some theories this ability relies {{on at least two}} stages or mechanisms related respectively to visual attention and visual working memory (WM). The early stage of <b>multiple</b> <b>object</b> processing – individuation – is a function of attention that allows the visual system to represent <b>multiple</b> <b>objects</b> simultaneously by selecting a limited number of locations and binding them to basic visual features. A second later stage related to visual working memory encodes in greater detail the indexed objects leading to their full representation. In the present thesis I investigated the functioning of <b>multiple</b> <b>object</b> processing in a set of behavioral and electrophysiological studies focusing on the modulation of two component of the event-related potentials - N 2 pc and CDA – which have been associated respectively to individuation and visual working memory. In all the experiments of the present thesis I established that both N 2 pc and CDA were modulated by the number of relevant items during the execution of an enumeration task. I exploited this effect in each Chapter of the present thesis to investigate different aspects of <b>multiple</b> <b>object</b> processing. In particular, in the first and second experiment (Chapter 2) I assessed the existence of a capacity limit in simultaneous processing as predicted by theories of individuation. In Chapter 3 I investigated the role of distracting information in simultaneous individuation. In Chapter 4 I focused on whether high-level features (such as semantic information) are incorporated in the representations produced at the stage of individuation. Finally in Chapter 5 I assessed the role of awareness in <b>multiple</b> <b>object</b> processing using a masking paradigm. The results provided new information on the way early individuation and late WM stages interact for successful object perception, as well as on their functional dissociation during <b>multiple</b> <b>object</b> processing...|$|R

Despite their usefulness, API protocols are often unavailable in practice because writing them is cumbersome and error prone. <b>Multiple</b> <b>object</b> API protocols are more expressive than single object API protocols.
