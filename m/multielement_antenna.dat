5000|$|In a <b>multielement</b> <b>antenna</b> array (such as a Yagi-Uda antenna), the {{driven element}} or active element is the {{element in the}} antenna (typically a metal rod) which is {{electrically}} connected to the receiver or transmitter. In a transmitting antenna it is driven or excited by the RF current from the transmitter, and {{is the source of}} the radio waves. In a receiving antenna it collects the incoming radio waves for reception, and converts them to tiny oscillating electric currents, which are applied to the receiver. Multielement antennas like the Yagi typically consist of a driven element, connected to the receiver or transmitter through a feed line, and a number of other elements which are not driven, called parasitic elements. The driven element is often a dipole. The parasitic elements act as resonators and couple electromagnetically with the driven element, and serve to modify the radiation pattern of the antenna, directing the radio waves in one direction, increasing the gain of the antenna.|$|E
5000|$|An antenna {{may have}} more than one driven element, {{although}} the most common <b>multielement</b> <b>antenna,</b> the Yagi, usually has only one. For example, transmitting antennas for AM radio stations often consist of several mast radiators, each of which functions as a half-wave monopole driven element, to create a particular radiation pattern. A two-element array with the elements spaced a quarter wavelength apart has a distinct cardioid radiation pattern when the second element is driven with a source -90° out of phase relative to the first element. A log-periodic antenna (LPDA) consists of many dipole elements of decreasing length, all of which are driven. However because they are different lengths, only one of the many dipoles is resonant at a given frequency, so only one is driven at a time. The dipole that is driven depends on the frequency of the signal. Phased arrays may have hundreds of driven elements. Household multiband television antennas generally consist of a hybrid between a UHF Yagi with one driven dipole and a log-periodic for VHF behind that with alternating active elements. The driven elements between the UHF and VHF are then coupled and often matched for a 75 ohm coaxial downlead to the receiver.|$|E

A layered space-time architecture, known as BLAST, has been proposed. A basic hypothesis made by the BLAST algorithm is that the symbol period is large compared to the maximum echo delay (hence, the data rate cannot be too high). In this paper, we use an approach that combines BLAST and OFDM. Its interest is to suppress the data rate constraint. First, the symbols are packed into matrices; then matrix manipulations prior to BLAST transmission provide a transmission system which is theoretically equivalent to many independent BLAST channels.

A parasitic element does this by acting as a passive resonator, something like a guitar's sound box, absorbing the radio waves from the nearby driven element and re-radiating them again with a different phase.

In [6], closed-form expressions for the spatial correlation function (SCF) of antenna arrays in a three-dimensional (3 D) multipath environment are derived. However, in [6] the distribution of the angle of arrival of multipaths is assumed to be uniform over a given range of angles, and the azimuth is independently distributed from elevation. In [7], a thorough review of different 2 D spatial correlation models is provided. By including the spatial information, the authors derive a closed-form expression for the ergodic capacity. In [8], the authors provide a capacity analysis of a dense <b>multielement</b> <b>antenna</b> system having obtained the spatial correlation values between the antenna elements. In addition, the idea of 3 D propagation has also been considered {{in a number of other}} research works [9 – 11]. Toeltsch et al. provided a statistical analysis of 3 D wideband measurement data after the application of a multipath parameter extraction algorithm, namely Unitary ESPRIT. The multipath components estimated were then clustered in the angular and delay domains, allowing a detailed statistical analysis of the propagation properties. In [10], the authors derived a cross-polarized <b>multielement</b> <b>antenna</b> channel model that takes into consideration the azimuth as well as the elevation domains.

40|$|Bandwidth, {{volume and}} energy {{are the basic}} {{resources}} for communications, and current signal processing techniques use these in many different ways. The bandwidth {{is limited by the}} antenna size, and maximizing the bandwidth of the elements and the design of <b>multielement</b> <b>antennas</b> (MEAs) require new research. This two-part thesis addresses antenna theoretic bandwidth and MEA evaluation. The limiting bandwidth of the most fundamental antenna element - the dipole - remains elusive despite its long research history. This motivates Part I, in which the bandwidth of the electric dipole is developed from theoretical and numerical methods, and recent measurements. The resulting antenna-theoretic bandwidth of the dipole with a feed gap offers new benchmark results for compact elements. The lossless, thin dipole with finite gap has a much wider bandwidth than was previously known, and the non-radiating feed is identified as the challenge to realize the available bandwidth. Using multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and other diversity techniques with large dimensions (many elements) is the key technology for high spectral efficiency. But large dimension MIMO is not yet used commercially, and the design methodology and evaluation of MEAs is undeveloped. There is no standard for evaluating MEAs used for MIMO communications, and currently, the physical evaluation of a MIMO terminal comprises coarse throughput tests in an idealized environment. The real-world performance of the terminal, and especially the antenna performance, remains unclear from such tests. This motivates Part II, which explores MEA evaluation using physical antenna parameters together with site-specific, ray-traced models for the spatial channel. Ray-tracing calculation is well established, but its application with MEAs is in its infancy. Using third-party ray-tracing files, an approach for evaluating MEAs for urban channels is presented. The advantage is that it maintains the full control of being computer-driven, thereby avoiding expensive,hard-to-repeat physical measurements, while incorporating the ground-truth of empirical antenna parameters...|$|R

Operators worldwide strive for capacity and coverage increase as the number of subscribers grows and demanding multimedia services are implemented. Complicated, expensive, and time-consuming optimization techniques that aim to improve the system performance, for example, drive test analysis; antenna and/or power optimization should ideally be avoided. <b>Multielement</b> <b>antenna</b> {{systems have been}} proven to increase capacity and decrease interference through spatial multiplexing and/or beamforming. Significant efforts are continuously made to analyse and simulate such systems {{with a high degree of}} accuracy although the nature of the assumptions often being made is sometimes doubtful. For instance, some studies in the literature assume that the signals received at adjacent antenna elements are uncorrelated. This may be considered an oversimplification of the challenges encountered in a wireless propagation channel. Further, occassionally elevation is ignored, and the effect of spatial correlation on the systems performance can be misleading, especially in urban clutter types. Our conjecture that elevation can have a significant effect on the correlation function has motivated this work. Various spatial correlation models have been proposed, where elevation is ignored and the distribution of scatterers or equivalently the angle of arrival (AoA) of paths at the mobile station (MS) (or even base station (BS)) is modeled as a two-dimensional (2 D) uniform, Gaussian, von Mises, or Laplacian [1 – 5] distribution. A drawback associated with distributions that are defined on the line (e.g., Gaussian) is that the summary statistics are calculated in such a way that the directionality of the variables is not taken into consideration.|$|E

In the initial setup, each antenna comprising the array is assumed to be an isotropic radiator (three dimensions). In two dimensions, this corresponds to a circular aperture being equally sensitive in all azimuthal directions, thus revealing an omnidirectional pattern. Whilst recognizing that this assumption hinders the realistic performance of a <b>multielement</b> <b>antenna</b> system, it enables us to study the broader picture of the spatial correlation effect on the system's performance (e.g., capacity).

This equation is an improvement of the circuit equation for antennas written in terms of self- and mutual impedances defined by the EMF method.

It is shown that under a more general 3 -D angle-of-arrival (AoA) model, namely, the Fisher-Bingham five-parameter (FB 5) distribution, the spatial fading correlation (SFC) that is experienced between the adjacent antenna array elements decreases as the elevation increases. The FB 5 distribution does not have a known series expansion, and therefore, the defining SFC integral can only numerically be evaluated. The proposed SFC function is further extended to capture the effect of multiple clusters of scatterers in the propagation channel. We, therefore, propose a mixture SFC function that is scaled according to the probability that each cluster contributes to the channel. The parameters of the individual components that constitute the mixture are estimated by using a soft expectation maximization (soft-EM) algorithm.

30|$|In this paper, the {{assumption}} of traditional horizontal wave propagation {{and its effect on}} the SCF have been reviewed. A novel approach is proposed (vMF) for modeling the distribution of scatterers in space. The spherical harmonic coefficients of the vMF distribution were derived and various simulations on the modified SCF function indicate that the correlation decreases as elevation increases when the elements are positioned on the median plane. The proposed method directly links the spatial correlation with the elevation of the incoming cluster of multipaths. It was also observed that if an element is elevated while the other is kept on the horizontal plane, signal correlations change significantly. Since most of the practical array designs include two-dimensional element configurations, the first case applies. The proposed model was further enhanced by the inclusion of an arbitrary weighting function to describe the effect of the antenna pattern on the spatial correlation. Finally, the effect of multiple clusters of scatterers that is frequently reported in the literature was also included in the SCF. The proposed model can be used to study the capacity in <b>multielement</b> <b>antenna</b> systems.|$|E
