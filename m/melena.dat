5|$|Pain {{typically}} {{occurs when}} the stomach is empty, between meals {{and in the early}} morning hours, but it can also occur at other times. Less common ulcer symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Bleeding can also occur; prolonged bleeding may cause anemia leading to weakness and fatigue. If bleeding is heavy, hematemesis, hematochezia, or <b>melena</b> may occur.|$|E
5|$|Not {{a single}} {{residence}} remained undamaged after the hurricane's passage in Bejucal, San Antonio de los Baños, Santiago de Las Vegas, and Mariel, {{and those that}} were not destroyed were unroofed. Nueva Paz suffered the loss of 110homes, while Madruga lost 100; only five remained standing at Managua, and of the eight left at Quivicán, all were severely damaged. At Jibacoa, only 32of the town's 82residences survived the storm. The seaside town of Guanabo was entirely lost, with floodwaters driving the town to sea and leaving its residents homeless. The hamlets of Mantilla, La Chorrera, and Paula disappeared entirely, while Candelaria was washed away {{with the loss of}} all its structures, of which a majority collapsed under the strength of the storm's powerful winds before being driven out to sea. Most structures in Cayajabos, Boyeros, and Aguacate were flattened, while the villages of Alquízar, Güira de <b>Melena,</b> and Vereda Nueva essentially vanished after the storm passed through. Guatao was entirely destroyed, suffering the loss of its apparently indestructible church, while Quemado wholly vanished and only four houses endured the storm's impacts at San Antonio de los Baños.|$|E
25|$|Naproxen (Aleve)* {{has a long}} {{half-life}} in {{dogs and}} can cause gastrointestinal irritation, anemia, <b>melena</b> (digested blood in feces), and vomiting.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{that require}} urgent medical {{attention}} are seizures, problems urinating, abnormal bruising or bleeding, <b>melena,</b> hematemesis, jaundice, fever and rigors, chest pain, hemiplegia, abnormal vision, dyspnea and edema.|$|E
25|$|Lower {{gastrointestinal}} bleeding is typically from the colon, rectum or anus. Common causes of lower {{gastrointestinal bleeding}} include hemorrhoids, cancer, angiodysplasia, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and aortoenteric fistula. It may be {{indicated by the}} passage of fresh red blood rectally, especially {{in the absence of}} bloody vomiting. Isolated <b>melena</b> may originate from anywhere between the stomach and the proximal colon.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{symptoms}} of bothropic envenomation include immediate burning pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, sweating, headache, massive {{swelling of the}} bitten extremity, hemorrhagic blebs, local necrosis, bleeding from the nose and gums, ecchymosis, erythemia, hypotension, tachycardia, coagulopathy with hypofibrinogenemia and thrombocytopenia, hematemesis, <b>melena,</b> epistaxis, hematuria, intracerebral hemorrhage and renal failure secondary to hypotension and bilateral cortical necrosis. There is usually some discoloration around the bite site, and rashes may develop on the torso or the extremities.|$|E
25|$|Ingestion of ricin causes pain, inflammation, and {{hemorrhage}} in the mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal system. Gastrointestinal symptoms quickly {{progress to}} severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). Hemorrhage causes bloody feces (<b>melena)</b> and vomiting blood (hematemesis). The low blood volume (hypovolemia) caused by gastrointestinal fluid loss {{can lead to}} organ failure in the pancreas, kidney, liver, and GI tract and progress to shock. Shock and organ failure are indicated by disorientation, stupor, weakness, drowsiness, excessive thirst (polydipsia), low urine production (oliguria), and bloody urine (hematuria).|$|E
25|$|Upper {{gastrointestinal}} bleeding {{is from a}} source between the pharynx and the ligament of Treitz. An upper source is characterised by hematemesis (vomiting up blood) and <b>melena</b> (tarry stool containing altered blood). About half of cases are due to peptic ulcer disease (gastric or duodenal ulcers). Esophageal inflammation and erosive disease are the next most common causes. In those with liver cirrhosis, 50–60% of bleeding is due to esophageal varices. Approximately half of those with peptic ulcers have an H. pylori infection. Other causes include Mallory-Weiss tears, cancer, and angiodysplasia.|$|E
25|$|Upper {{gastrointestinal}} bleeding is {{gastrointestinal bleeding}} {{in the upper}} gastrointestinal tract, commonly defined as bleeding arising from the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. Blood may be observed in vomit (hematemesis) or in altered form in the stool (<b>melena).</b> Depending on {{the severity of the}} blood loss, there may be symptoms of insufficient circulating blood volume and shock. As a result, upper gastrointestinal bleeding is considered a medical emergency and typically requires hospital care for urgent diagnosis and treatment. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding can be caused by peptic ulcers, gastric erosions, esophageal varices, and some rarer causes such as gastric cancer.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the more}} {{dangerous}} systemic symptoms, hemorrhage and coagulation defects {{are the most}} striking. Hematemesis, <b>melena,</b> hemoptysis, hematuria and epistaxis also occur and may lead to hypovolemic shock. Almost all patients develop oliguria or anuria {{within a few hours}} to as late as 6 days post bite. In some cases, kidney dialysis is necessary due to acute renal failure (ARF), but this is not often caused by hypotension. It is more often the result of intravascular hemolysis, which occurs in about half of all cases. In other cases, ARF is often caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation.|$|E
500|$|This {{ligament}} is {{an important}} anatomical landmark of the duodenojejunal flexure, separating {{the upper and lower}} gastrointestinal tracts. For example, bloody vomit or <b>melena,</b> black tarry stools, usually indicate a gastrointestinal bleed from a location in the upper gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, hematochezia, bright red blood or clots in the stool, usually indicates gastrointestinal bleeding from {{the lower part of the}} gastrointestinal tract. It is an especially important landmark to note when looking at the bowel for the presence of malrotation of the gut, a syndrome often suspected in young children when they have episodes of recurrent vomiting. Visualising a normal location of the ligament of Treitz in radiological images is critical in ruling out malrotation of the gut in a child; [...] it is abnormally located when malrotation is present.|$|E
500|$|He {{also used}} [...] "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God" [...] by novelty singer Corn Mo at {{the insistence of}} Nick Offerman, who plays three minor roles in the film. The Portland Youth Jazz Orchestra All Stars plays Ward's [...] "One Life Away" [...] as an [...] "old-timey instrumental" [...] for one of Mercer's dreams, an homage to a dancing {{sequence}} seen in Jean-Luc Godard's 1964 film Bande à part. For the closing credits, Ward and Zooey Deschanel recorded a duet cover of [...] "When I Get to the Border" [...] from Richard and Linda Thompson's 1974 album I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight. The pair found themselves [...] "mutually charmed", according to The New York Times <b>Melena</b> Ryzik, and bonded over similar musical interests. After Ward listened to Deschanel's demos, they paired up and formed the band She & Him. Pitchfork Media reported in April 2007 of a future The Go-Getter soundtrack to be released by Merge Records, including a 12-song tracklist, but Merge later claimed that it was never planning to release a soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|In Lauper's first {{effort at}} {{writing for the}} stage, she found that it {{required}} a sustained effort to write songs for the different characters. [...] Lauper joked about the difficulty of writing her first score: [...] "How much of a stretch is it for me to write songs about fashion, funny relationships, people changing their minds and shoes?" [...] The first song that Lauper wrote was the opening number, which included {{a wide range of}} voices. Her process was to conceive a song and sing it into her iPhone, and orchestrator Stephen Oremus would write it down. Oremus would then [...] "'blow up' the vocal line into harmonies, create the incidental music that linked scenes and songs" [...] and orchestrate the material. The songs range in style [...] "from pop to funk to new wave to tango, with highly personal lyrics". [...] New York Times critic <b>Melena</b> Ryzik wrote: [...] "Though there are plenty of hooky, rousing numbers, the emotional heart of Kinky Boots is several ballads about the weight of parental expectations." [...] The musical uses a twelve-piece orchestra consisting of keyboards, percussion, bass, guitars, reeds, violin, viola, cello, trumpet, and trombone.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the decade}} later {{featured}} {{a decline in}} output by neo soul artists, with many of them failing to make a commercial impact after previous successes or not releasing a follow-up album. Badu's commercial viability decreased as each of her releases following her debut Baduizm departed further from that album's music. Hill followed-up her 1998 debut, considered the best-selling neo soul album, with the 2002 live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0, a combative, confessional work in which she expresses her misgivings about fame. <b>Melena</b> Ryzik of The New York Times wrote in a retrospect of that [...] "era of left-of-center black singer-songwriters", stating [...] "many of them struggled to keep their creative momentum, conflicted about their early mainstream success." [...] Producer and Soulquarians member Questlove elaborated on the artists' regression from the mainstream, saying [...] "I {{think most of us}} went through our psychosomatic, quasi-self-saboteur stage. Once we got that first taste of success, I think just the pressure of reacting got to all of us. Some of us released some of the craziest records of our career." [...] Other artists such as D'Angelo and Hill went on indefinite hiatus from the music scene. Tyler Lewis from PopMatters attributed the decline to [...] "the downside of [...] rejection of the term [...] ".|$|E
500|$|With technology, mobile phones, and the Internet slowly {{creeping}} into Cuba, foreign ideas {{made their way}} to Cuban dissident circles in Havana. [...] A group of anarcho-capitalist libertarians formed the Cuban Anarcho-Capitalist Club, which evolved into Mises Institute Cuba (based on the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Alabama) and the Benjamin Franklin Libertarian Library. [...] On February 2, 2017, two members of Mises Institute Cuba and the Benjamin Franklin Libertarian Library were arrested by undercover State Security agents. [...] They were sentenced on falsified charges of attempted assault on a police officer and are currently incarcerated in the labor prison at <b>Melena</b> del Sur. [...] As an official protest against the Castro regime, the members of Mises Cuba and the Benjamin Franklin Libertarian Library formed the Partido Libertario Cubano - José Martí (Cuban Libertarian Party - José Martí) on May 7, 2017 in Havana. [...] Their aim is to use civil disobedience to undermine the Castro regime's repressions against civil liberties, and they have repeatedly ignored police and government warnings not to congregate or post dissident literature. [...] Like the 19th century Cuban anarchists, the Cuban Libertarian Party maintains friendly ties with anarchists in Spain and the United States, while denouncing the colonialism imposed by both countries in the past.|$|E
500|$|On October 14 a {{tropical}} depression {{developed in the}} southern Caribbean Sea about [...] north-northwest of Colón, Panama. Strengthening into a minimal tropical storm the next day, it gradually curved to the north-northwest {{over the next four}} days, becoming a hurricane on October 18. It then quickly intensified to a major hurricane early on October 19 as it turned northward toward western Cuba. Shortly before striking the Isla de la Juventud south of Nueva Gerona, it attained maximum sustained winds of [...] on October 20. The cyclone then continued strengthening, peaking at [...] before making landfall on the Cuban mainland south of Güira de <b>Melena.</b> The center passed just 10mi (16km) east of the capital Havana before entering the Straits of Florida about [...] south of Key West, Florida. The cyclone then weakened and turned to the northeast on October 21, passing within [...] of the Florida Keys while remaining east of Florida. Nearly two days later, about 48hours after turning east-northeast, the cyclone passed over Bermuda late on October 22 with sustained winds up to Hamilton, Bermuda, recorded calm winds and [...] in the eye, along with sustained winds up to [...] with gusts to [...] afterward. Three days thereafter, on October 25 the storm executed a clockwise, semicircular loop to the south-southwest, and a day later it lost hurricane intensity. Gradually curving to the west, the cyclone dissipated early on October 28, though it was once believed to have been an extratropical cyclone as early as October 23.|$|E
