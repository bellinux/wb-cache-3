Our results show that the steady-state viscosity measurements using the on-line rheometer are in excellent agreement with those obtained using commercial rheometers. The steady-state and the complex viscosities of the composites were found to be fairly close to that of the matrix, but the Cox-Merz rule was not verified for the composites at high rates. The elasticity of the composites was found to be equal to that of the polypropylene matrix. The apparent extensional viscosity was obtained from the pressure drop in the planar converging die of the slit rheometer using the analyses proposed by Cogswell [1] and Binding [2]. The extensional viscosity of the polypropylene was found to be much larger than the shear viscosity at low strain rates with a Trouton ratio of about 40 that decreased rapidly with increasing strain rate down to the value of 4 at 200 s(- 1). The extensional viscosity of the composites was also found to be close to that of the matrix, with values 35 and 5 % larger for the 30 and 10 wt% reinforced polypropylenes, respectively.

Beside the implementation of lightweight materials such as Ultra-High Strength Steel, Aluminum, Magnesium or Fiber Reinforced Polymers there is an upcoming request of Hybrid Materials. Metal Plastic Hybrid Structures are an efficient solution to use the right material at the right place in design space. State of the art regarding production technologies for hybrid structures is that metal components are produced separately in conventional forming processes. These parts are engaged in the molding die and the core injection molding process is only responsible for shaping plastic ingredient and joining. Such process chains are complex and extensive. The paper shows a new approach of the process combination of conventionally metal forming technologies and the {{application of}} the fluid plastic from molding process as a forming media in the meaning of hydroforming.

40|$|Fiber-reinforced {{plastics}} are hybrid materials {{designed for}} the needs of the 21 st century. With their capability to form low weight structures, while preserving high stiffness and excellent damping, these composites provide solutions for a broad range of markets. Unfortunately, some of these advantages are not used in practice because there exist no fast and automated manufacturing processes for efficient production. In the research field of continuous-reinforced thermoplastic composites, industry is facing a challenge of high viscose polymer melt and thereby an imperfect fiber wet-out. As a result, synergy effects of fibers within a polymer could not be fully exploited. The topic of this work is to adapt new processing technologies for reactive thermoplastic polymers. On one hand, fast heating and cooling options offer processes with shorter cycle time, and on the other hand, low viscosity of reactive polymers impregnates the textile structures faster. This results in faster and cheaper manufacturing of composites that are yet to be realized for the market. All FRPCs were produced on a continuous compression <b>molding</b> <b>press.</b> As a noncontinuous technology, an inductive heated CageSystem® from RocTool has been selected. Entropically driven ring-opening cyclic oligomers form Cyclics with waterlike melt viscosities are chosen as reactive matrix. The viscosity of Cyclic Butylene Terephthalate (CBT*) was measured using a rheometer. The rheological behavior is determined under isothermal conditions for various temperatures. The chemical transformation from oligomer to macromolecule pCBT 1 was assessed by size exclusion chromatography. Based on these studies, a kinetic polymerization model was constructed which involved an Arrhenius-type equation. By using the activation energy and pre-exponential factor, it was possible to offer an exact mathematical solution for the prediction of isothermal conversion. A numerical solution of the Arrhenius equation helped to predict the polymerization for any timetemperature conditions. Furthermore, the polymerization model was extended to describe the chemo-rheology. Inserting specific material parameters, the bipartite model was able to provide a numerical prognosis for the viscosity with the input parameters time-temperature. All models were calibrated and validated with the experimental data. The continuous compression <b>molding</b> <b>press</b> was used to consolidate CBT-prepregs and PBT-prepregs. As reinforcing phase, a multiaxial non-crimp-fabric from Ahlstrom was used. This fabric contained glass fibers with a “CBT*-compatible” sizing. The design of experiments was mainly focusing on the variation in the temperature distribution in process direction with respect to process speeds. An extensive analysis, from optical to energy absorption, was performed on the resulting FRPC-product, called organic sheet. All test results showed a better performance for GF-pCBT compared to GF-PBT. Even for much higher process speed, the material properties of GF-pCBT did not deteriorate strongly in contrast to GF-PBT. The enhancement was traced to a better fiber-matrix interface (e. g., ILSS values) and to an excellent fiber wet-out with pCBT (e. g., SEM pictures). Viscosity and impregnation are the main factors behind the transversal visco-elastic impregnation model that was deduced. An arithmetic function that tracks the impregnation process for the classical thermoplastic PBT and its reactive pendant CBT* was derived. This was based on the dimensionless B-factor which was considered as technology independent performance indicator. The model was able to link the fast impregnation with CBT* - the viscosity of which is 10 - 5 magnitude lower than PBT - to all temperature-time-conditions. An optimization method was used to find process parameters to realize a minimum cycle time for the continuous process. This model was adapted to the non-continuous pressing technology to find the minimum cycle time. To evaluate the economic potential, a transparent process analysis was set up in form of a static cost calculation. In a first step, all monetary activities from each technology were identified and rated. The cycle time - as main capacity indicator - was based on the chemo-rheological model introduced above. Different break-even analyses and production costs highlighted the techno-economic potential of the related process-material-combination. A synergistic effect between innovative process technologies and reactive thermoplastic polymer was found. Faster and more efficient technologies for the production of fiber-reinforced plastics have been systematically developed and evaluated. The results were achieved with an intelligent combination of manufacturing technology and modern reactive thermoplastic polymers. Moreover, the approach of this work can be transferred to the other reactive thermoplastic matrix-based composites...|$|E
40|$|PNNL {{conducted}} a systematic optical modeling effort {{to study and}} compare retroreflector designs with respect to available optical materials. The optical Strehl ratio (SR) and cross section figures of merit were {{used to compare the}} performance of candidate optical designs. Further modeling was conducted to assess the relationships between standoff range and retroreflector diameter and cross section. Analysis showed that small diameter retroreflectors have very high optical link loss, since the net loss scales by retroreflector diameter to the 4 th power. Optical retroreflection efficiency is also important, but extracting ideal performance from a complicated design must be tempered {{by the fact that the}} effective retroreflector range varies only as the fourth root of the cross section. It's therefore imperative to maintain a reasonable retroreflector diameter, but striving for perfect optical performance may be a costly effort that does not merit the modest performance gain. Several promising designs were developed for visible and mid-infrared applications, which embraced lessons learned in the standoff range study. These designs included a polymer clad glass core approach for visible wavelengths and a concentric shell design using chalcogenide glass for the mid-infrared. Injection molding feasibility studies demonstrated that it was practical to fabricate visible polymer retroreflectors using this approach. Such an approach may be a practical solution for the LLNL project. Our primary focus is to develop mid-infrared designs; therefore compression molding chalcogenide glass was adopted for fabricating mid-infrared retroreflectors. A significant effort was focused on developing practical compression molding methods that provided reasonable device yield. A custom compression <b>molding</b> <b>press</b> was developed in collaboration with a private engineering firm. Many successful molding studies were conducted during this effort, but ultimately the fragile nature of the chalcogenide glass and the unfavorable thermal expansion properties limited the feasibility of fabricating the thin shell structures needed for this design. An alternative Cat's Eye retroreflector design was therefore adopted. This design is constructed using two hemispherical structures that can be fabricated by conventional grinding and polishing methods or by molding with high yield. The cross section of this design is very good (and can be further improved by applying a highly reflective coating to the rear surface), but has reduced field of view as a design trade off as well as the isotropic nature of Luneburg-style retroreflector...|$|E

The tape placement process was compared to a conventional <b>press</b> <b>molding</b> process in terms of interfacial fracture toughness. The tape placed specimens were found to outperform the <b>press</b> <b>molded</b> specimens. Additional experiments were performed to investigate {{the influence of the}} degree of crystallinity and the process induced weld interface on the measured fracture toughnes...|$|R
