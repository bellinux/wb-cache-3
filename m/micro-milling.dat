Cutting strategy leads to different burr shape: up-milling burrs have a large curvature, whereas down-milling burrs are slightly bent. An affected layer of about 10 μm has been observed for the austenitic NiTi. The proposed experimental approach give the opportunity to study burr formation in <b>micro-milling,</b> the machinability of alloys or superelastic NiTi shape memory and a qualitative explanation of burr formation has been developed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for chatter modelling in <b>micro-milling.</b> The model takes into account: the nonlinearity of the uncut chip thickness including the run-out effect; velocity dependent <b>micro-milling</b> cutting forces; {{the dynamics of the}} tool-holder-spindle assembly. The uncut chip thickness is determined after considering the full kinematics of the cutting tool including the run-out effect. The <b>micro-milling</b> cutting forces are determined by: (i) a finite element (FE) prediction of the cutting forces in orthogonal cutting at different cutting velocities and uncut chip thicknesses; (ii) describing the relationship between cutting forces, cutting velocities and uncut chip thicknesses into a nonlinear equation; (iii) incorporating the uncut chip thickness model into the relationship of the cutting forces as function of the cutting velocity and the uncut chip thickness. The modal dynamic parameters at the cutting tool tip are determined for the tool-holder-spindle assembly and used for solving the equation of motion. The <b>micro-milling</b> process is modelled as two degrees of freedom system where the modal dynamic parameters for the tool-holder-spindle assembly and the <b>micro-milling</b> cutting forces are considered. Due to nonlinearities in the <b>micro-milling</b> cutting forces, the equation of motion is integrated numerically in the time domain using the Runge–Kutta fourth order method. The displacements in the x and y directions are obtained for one revolution-per-tool. Statistical variances are then employed as a chatter detection criterion in the time-domain solution. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) inspection is carried out to observe potential chatter marks on the micro-milled AISI 4340 steel surfaces at different spindle speeds and depths of cut. The predicted stability lobes and the experimentally obtained stability limits resulted in satisfactory agreement. The influence of the run-out effect on the stability lobes at different feed rates was investigated, which demonstrated the capability of the developed chatter model to consider quantitatively the run-out phenomenon. The results showed that the stability limits decrease by increasing the run-out length...|$|E
40|$|Measuring low {{concentrations}} of clinically-important biomarkers using porous bead-based lab-on-a-chip (LOC) platforms {{is critical for}} the successful implementation of point-of-care (POC) devices. One way to meet this objective is to optimize the geometry of the bead holder, referred to here as a micro-container. In this work, two geometric micro-containers were explored, the inverted pyramid frustum (PF) and the inverted clipped pyramid frustum (CPF). Finite element models of this bead array assay system were developed to optimize the micro-container and bead geometries for increased pressure, to increase analyte capture in porous bead-based fluorescence immunoassays. Custom <b>micro-milled</b> micro-container structures containing an inverted CPF geometry resulted in a 28 % reduction in flow-through regions from traditional anisotropically-etched pyramidal geometry derived from Si- 111 termination layers. This novel "reduced flow-through" design resulted in a 33 % increase in analyte penetration into the bead and twofold increase in fluorescence signal intensity as demonstrated with C-Reactive Protein (CRP) antigen, an important biomarker of inflammation. A consequent twofold decrease {{in the limit of}} detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) of a proof-of-concept assay for the free isoform of Prostate-Specific Antigen (free PSA), an important biomarker for prostate cancer detection, is also presented. Furthermore, a 53 % decrease in the bead diameter is shown to result in a 160 % increase in pressure and 2. 5 -fold increase in signal, as estimated by COMSOL models and confirmed experimentally by epi-fluorescence microscopy. Such optimizations of the bead micro-container and bead geometries have the potential to significantly reduce the LODs and reagent costs for spatially programmed bead-based assay systems of this type...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to: (1) {{establish}} a conceptual design that integrates commercial steel mill technology with radioactive scrap metal (RSM) processing to produce carbon and stainless steel sheet and plate at a grade suitable for fabricating into radioactive waste containers; (2) determine the economic feasibility of building a <b>micro-mill</b> in the Western US to process 30, 000 tons of RSM per year from both DOE and the nuclear utilities; and (3) provide recommendations for implementation. For purposes of defining the project, it is divided into phases: economic feasibility and conceptual design; preliminary design; detail design; construction; and operation. This study comprises the bulk of Phase 1. It is divided into four sections. Section 1 provides the reader with a complete overview extracting pertinent data, recommendations and conclusions from the remainder of the report. Section 2 defines the variables that impact the design requirements. These data form the baseline to create a preliminary conceptual design that is technically sound, economically viable, and capitalizes on economies of scale. Priorities governing the design activities are: (1) minimizing worker exposure to radionuclide hazards, (2) maximizing worker safety, (3) minimizing environmental contamination, (4) minimizing secondary wastes, and (5) establishing engineering controls to insure that the plant will be granted a license in the state selected for operation. Section 3 provides details of the preliminary conceptual design that was selected. The cost of project construction is estimated and the personnel needed to support the steel-making operation and radiological and environmental control are identified. Section 4 identifies the operational costs and supports the economic feasibility analysis. A detailed discussion of the resulting conclusions and recommendations is included in this section...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{identification}} and measurement of internal voids and porosity {{is an important}} step towards improvement of production processes to obtain high quality materials and products. Recently, the importance of knowing the exact size, shape, volume and location of defects has become even higher as tighter requirements and new standards have been introduced in industry. There are several well-established methods for defects evaluation based on various principles (both destructive and non-destructive). However, all conventional methods have various deficiencies and the information about internal voids/porosity that can be extracted is limited. Most of these drawbacks can be overcome by using X-ray computed tomography (CT). Unlike other methods, CT provides full three-dimensional information about shape, size and distribution of internal voids and porosity; however, the accuracy of measurements is still under investigation. Hence, further evaluations on CT porosity measurements must be performed in order to consider X-ray computed tomography a reliable instrument for the assessment and detection of internal defects. A reference object with artificial defects was used in this research work in order to evaluate the accuracy of porosity measurements by CT. The reference object was manufactured by ultra-precision micro milling. The object contains dismountable components with embedded internal hemispherical features that simulate internal porosity. The artificial porosity was <b>micro-milled</b> on top surfaces of dismountable cylindrical inserts. The hemispherical calottes were thereafter calibrated by traceable coordinate measuring systems and calibrated values were compared to actual values measured by a CT system. The accuracy of CT porosity measurements was then evaluated based on results obtained on various measurands, using different software tools and measuring procedures, comparing real scans to numerical simulations and investigating the influence of CT system parameters settings on measurement results...|$|R
