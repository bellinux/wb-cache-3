5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in the risk that a person will develop PTE; people with the ApoE-ε4 allele may be at higher risk for PTE.

However, most studies have found that having family <b>members</b> <b>with</b> epilepsy does not significantly increase the risk of PTS, suggesting that genetics are not a strong risk factor.|$|E
