5|$|By 15th century, the Malacca Sultanate, whose hegemony {{reached over}} much of the western <b>Malay</b> archipelago, had become the centre of Islamization in the east. The Malaccan {{tradition}} was transmitted onwards and fostered a vigorous ethos of <b>Malay</b> identity. Since this era, the Islamic faith became closely identified with <b>Malay</b> society and {{played a significant role in}} defining the <b>Malay</b> identity. The close identification of the Malays with Islam continued until the 20th century and was finally entrenched in the Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia as well as in the national philosophy of Brunei known as the <b>Malay</b> Islamic Monarchy.|$|E

More <b>Malays,</b> including middle-class <b>Malays</b> and those associated with Islamic Organizations, got involved in Reformasi movement, as compared to similar issues in the past.

The dialect of <b>Malay</b> spoken in Kuching is known as Bahasa Sarawak (Sarawakian <b>Malay</b> Language), which is a subset of the <b>Malay</b> language. The dialect used in Kuching is a little different from the dialect used in Miri.

Despite running low on ammunition and food, the <b>Malay</b> Regiments put up strong resistance, inflicting a heavy toll on the Japanese invaders. Outnumbered, the defenders were finally overrun and massacred by reinforced Japanese forces. A <b>Malay</b> officer, Second Lieutenant Adnan Bin Saidi, was captured alive and tortured by the Japanese, before being executed. The story of his heroism became well known throughout Singapore.|$|E

30|$|In the HSAs of this study, the {{particular}} populations were merged {{into a group}} pursuant to the result of STRUCTURE analysis. For the first HSA, all Peninsular Malaysia <b>Malays,</b> Thai Pattani and Indonesians were merged into a group named <b>Malays</b> (MY), the Chinese (CN) group consisted of Jinuo and Wa, while the group of Indians (IN) comprised of Marathi and Telugu. This analysis was done to indicate the proportion of HS among the three groups and to identify which group was a bigger genetic contributor to <b>Malays</b> group. To represent the divergence pattern of the northern Peninsular Malaysia <b>Malays,</b> we combined the Melayu Kedah, Melayu Kelantan and Thai Pattani into a group named northern <b>Malays</b> (NMY) and implemented the second HSA with the Chinese and Indians groups. The third HSA was done {{to examine the relationship}} of the peninsula <b>Malays</b> (PMY) group consisted of Peninsular Malaysia <b>Malays</b> and Thai Pattani with the indigenous populations, which are the Orang Asli Semang (Jahai and Kensiu) grouped as Negrito (NG) and the Proto-Malays Temuan labeled as Proto-Malays (PM).|$|R

5|$|English was the {{official}} language of Sarawak from 1963 to 1974 due to opposition from First Chief Minister of Sarawak Stephen Kalong Ningkan {{to the use of}} the <b>Malay</b> language in Sarawak. In 1974 the new Chief Minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub recognised <b>Malay</b> alongside English as an official language of Sarawak. This new status given to the <b>Malay</b> language was further reinforced by new education standards transitioning curriculum to <b>Malay.</b> In 1985 English lost the status of an official language, leaving only <b>Malay.</b> Despite official policy, Sarawak opposition members argue that English remained the de facto official language of Sarawak. English is still spoken in the legal courts, and state legislative assembly. In 2015, Chief Minister Adenan Satem announced that English will be reinstated as an official language.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{of modern}} human {{habitation}} in Malaysia dates back 40,000years. In the <b>Malay</b> Peninsula, the first inhabitants {{are thought to}} be Negritos. Traders and settlers from India and China arrived as early as the first century AD, establishing trading ports and coastal towns {{in the second and third}} centuries. Their presence resulted in strong Indian and Chinese influences on the local cultures, and the people of the <b>Malay</b> Peninsula adopted the religions of Hinduism and Buddhism. Sanskrit inscriptions appear as early as the fourth or fifth century. The Kingdom of Langkasuka arose around the second century in the northern area of the <b>Malay</b> Peninsula, lasting until about the 15th century. Between the 7th and 13th centuries, much of the southern <b>Malay</b> Peninsula was part of the maritime Srivijayan empire. By the 13th and the 14th century, the Majapahit empire had successfully wrested control over most of the peninsula and the <b>Malay</b> Archipelago from Srivijaya. Islam began to spread among Malays in the 14th century. In the early 15th century, Parameswara, a runaway king of the former Kingdom of Singapura linked to the old Srivijayan court, founded the Malacca Sultanate. Melaka was an important commercial centre during this time, attracting trade from around the region.|$|E

5|$|The British {{educational}} policies segregating {{the different}} races — providing minimal public education for <b>Malays,</b> and leaving non-Malays {{to their own}} devices — did not help matters. The <b>Malays,</b> predominantly rural-dwellers, were not encouraged to socialise with the more urban non-Malays. The economic impoverishment of the <b>Malays</b> which set them apart from the better-off Chinese also fanned racial sentiments.|$|R
5000|$|Malaysian <b>Malays</b> (Malaysian: Melayu Malaysia, Jawi: ملايو مليسيا) are ethnic <b>Malays</b> {{domiciled}} throughout Malaysia {{and native}} to the modern state.

5|$|In {{less than}} a month, the Japanese {{repaired}} the causeway and invaded the Singapore island easily.

Onn Jaafar, a local <b>Malay</b> politician who later became the Chief Minister of Johor, formed the United <b>Malay</b> National Organisation party on 11 May 1946 when the Malays expressed their widespread disenchantment over the British government's action for granting citizenship laws to non-Malays in the proposed states of the Malayan Union. An agreement over the policy was then reached in the town with Malays agreeing with the dominance of economy by the non-Malays and the Malays' dominance in political matters being agreed upon by non-Malays. Racial conflict between the <b>Malay</b> and non-Malays, especially the Chinese, is being provoked continuously since the Malayan Emergency.|$|E

Indigenous groups speak languages such as Berawan, Bruneian/Kedayan, Miriek, Iban, Bidayuh, Kayan, Kenyah, and Kelabit. Meanwhile, the Chinese would speak Mandarin, Hakka Chinese, Cantonese, Teochew dialect, Hainanese, and the Fuzhou dialect. However, {{the younger generation}} in Miri tends to use lingua francas (Mandarin and <b>Malay)</b> rather than their indigenous languages (such as Kayan and Kelabit), {{with the exception of}} Iban, which is widely used here, or Chinese dialects (Hokkien and Foochow), and an effort has been made to promote the usage of indigenous languages among the younger generation.|$|E
