Outbreak detection methods and algorithms as the main tools for public health sur-veillance systems are {{under the umbrella of}} tem-poral and spatial methods (1). “There are three different approaches which might be used by syn-dromic surveillance systems to examine the per-formances of outbreak detection algorithms in-cluding real data testing, fully synthetic simulation and semi-synthetic simulation(2). ” The first ap-proach, i. e. real data testing, provide the highest degree of validity (3). Nevertheless, surveillance data for <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> outbreaks or bioterrorist threats are not existent (4). Accordingly, there ar...|$|E
