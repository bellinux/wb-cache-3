5|$|Dave Lister, {{played by}} Craig Charles, is a genial Liverpudlian and {{self-described}} bum. He was the lowest-ranking of the 169 crew <b>members</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ship before the accident. He has a long-standing desire {{to return to}} Earth and start a farm and/or diner on Fiji (which is under three feet of water following a volcanic eruption), but is left impossibly far away by the accident, which renders him the last (known) surviving member of the human race. He likes Indian food, especially chicken vindaloo, which is a recurring theme in the series.|$|E
5|$|Following the ruling, {{the company}} barred the union from soliciting new <b>members</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> company {{property}} and began offering incentives to new workers to sign contracts wherein they {{promised not to}} join the union. The AASEREA objected to the company's policy and the prior agreement required the Public Service Commission rule on the matter. The commission sided with the company on both issues on August 26, 1914 and barred union solicitation on company property, and upheld {{the right of the}} company to hire non-union employees.|$|E

5|$|The IOC {{has often}} been criticised for being an {{intractable}} organisation, with several <b>members</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> committee for life. The presidential terms of Avery Brundage and Juan Antonio Samaranch were especially controversial. Brundage was president for over 20 years, and during his tenure he protected the Olympics from political involvement {{and the influence of}} advertising. He was accused of both racism, for resisting exclusion of apartheid South Africa, and antisemitism. Under the Samaranch presidency, the office was accused of both nepotism and corruption. Samaranch's ties with the Franco regime in Spain were also a source of criticism.|$|E

5|$|An {{advocate}} for universal and single-payer health care, Wolf is {{a supporter of}} both Massachusetts health care reform and President Barack Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). On July 10, 2012 Wolf testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to discuss {{the effects of the}} two laws. Despite repeated jabs by Republican <b>members</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> committee that it laws would stifle business and hurt employees, Wolf defended the reforms waveringly. Wolf's further statements on the positive aspects of PPACA were eventually cut short by Chairman Darrell Issa, a staunch PPACA opponent. Wolf supported a failed amendment in 2012 which would have implemented single-payer health care in Massachusetts if a study proved it was more effective in reducing costs than the state's current model.|$|E

5|$|As weather {{conditions}} worsened, Royal Navy destroyers were {{only able to}} rescue 90 survivors from the three German ships. Before the rescue operation was suspended to engage TA 20, Wheatland {{pulled out of the}} sea three officers and 68 seamen—most of them crew of UJ 202. The Kriegsmarine sortied TA 40 and TA 45 corvettes as well as S 33 and S 154 E-boats to look for survivors, finding seventeen TA 20 crew <b>members</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> islet of Trstenik on 3 November. The group included seven wounded, tended by a local lighthouse crew. Besides them, the ships rescued one UJ 202 and three UJ 208 crew members from the sea. The deteriorating weather also prevented retrieval of the coast watchers for four days. More than two hundred Germans perished in this action, including the flotilla commander and all three ship commanding officers.|$|E
5|$|In February 1943, the West Nohno {{completed}} her nine-month journey {{when she arrived}} at Mobile, Alabama, after sailing via Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and Key West. The Chicago Daily Tribune reported that during this voyage, seaman James Orville Couchois had incited subordination and disloyalty among the crew. The head of the Naval Armed Guard detachment aboard West Nohno reported Couchois' activities, as well as comments from other crew <b>members</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ship. After the ship had docked at Mobile, Couchois {{was removed from the}} ship and ultimately faced a trial for sedition. Couchois, who was the deck manager for the National Maritime Union of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, was convicted and sentenced to a prison term of five years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1845, Palmer {{traveled}} to Oregon without his family, as captain of a wagon train of 23 wagons. Stephen Meek served as the train's paid guide. Meek left the group at Fort Hall to lead some of the <b>members</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Meek Cutoff. The remaining parts of the wagon train {{reached the end of}} the overland Oregon Trail at the Columbia River, and unwilling to wait for transport down the dangerous Cascade Rapids, Palmer's party joined Sam Barlow's party in a quest for passage through the Cascade Range around the south side of Mount Hood. Palmer climbed to the 9,000-foot level of Mount Hood on October 7, 1845—with little food and the scant protection of moccasins—to scout a route off the mountains. This was Mount Hood's first recorded climb; the Palmer Glacier on the mountain is named for him.|$|E

5|$|The central cast {{are part}} of a special task force created by the United Nations to {{investigate}} and neutralize the Schwarzwelt. Players take control of a nameless member of the task force (Japanese in the original and American in the localization). Alongside the main protagonist, there are three main crew <b>members</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Red Sprite: , the crew's leader; , an experienced American soldier who seeks rewards for his work; and , a knowledgeable Russian scientist. Other characters include , the Red Sprite's AI computer; the angel , who represents the forces of God; , a primordial mother goddess who controls the demons of the Schwarzwelt; and , an avatar of Lucifer who watches the protagonist's actions.|$|E
5|$|The crew <b>members</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fore-mast {{initially}} {{reached an}} agreement with the Malagasy: the crew's lives were to be spared on condition that they sailed Meermin back to Madagascar; but this truce broke down, as a result of which most of those crew members were also killed, and all were thrown overboard. The crew in the gunroom were short of food and drink; Muller decided that they should attempt to regain control of Meermin. Neither Muller nor Gulik took part in the attack, as both were wounded. It was led by bosun Laurens Pieters; twelve crewmen left the gunroom, shooting as they went. Pieters and another of the attack party were killed on deck; the rest retreated back to the gunroom, where another crewman, who had been severely wounded, later died.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of judicial <b>members</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Council may also pose additional problems. There {{is a possibility}} of conflict of interest for judges who sit {{as members of the}} Council if they find themselves having to review the very Acts of Parliament that they have either endorsed or rejected previously. This is exacerbated {{by the fact that the}} Council, in examining the legitimacy of Bills, plays a quasi-judicial role. There may be confusion as regards the legality of a piece of legislation if, for example, it was initially condemned by the Council but enacted by the Government and later endorsed by the courts upon judicial review. When the potential conflict between the Chief Justice's role as head of the judiciary and as Chairman of the Council was raised in 2010 by Githu Muigai, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Tolerance, he was informed that the Chief Justice would recuse himself from any matter in which a conflict arose.|$|E
