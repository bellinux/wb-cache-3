6000|$|... 'My dear Rigby,' {{said the}} Duke, 'pardon <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> you. Unhappily, {{there is no}} doubt Lord Spencer is dead, for I am one of his executors.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must excuse <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> you, Mrs. Tulliver; I have {{business}} {{that must be}} attended to; and I think {{there is nothing more}} necessary to be said." ...|$|E
60|$|Jack. Pray excuse <b>me,</b> Lady Bracknell, <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> you again, {{but it is}} {{only fair}} to tell you that {{according}} to the terms of her grandfather's will Miss Cardew does not come legally of age till she is thirty-five.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Only {{listen to}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> a moment,' <b>interrupted</b> Ralph, seriously {{alarmed by the}} {{violence}} of her emotions. 'I didn't know it would be so; it was impossible <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to foresee it. I did all I could.--Come, let us walk about. You are faint with {{the closeness of the}} room, and the heat of these lamps. You will be better now, if you make the slightest effort.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] {{said the}} steward, [...] "I beg a {{thousand}} pardons <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> you, but what I have long foreseen has taken place. Nothing {{remains of the}} sums you gave <b>me</b> <b>for</b> your expenses, and all other sources of income are also at end, having been transferred by you to others. If you wish me to remain in your service, furnish me with the necessary funds, else I must withdraw." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> you, but {{allow me}} to suggest that any further remarks {{you may have to}} make on the subject had better be made to my friend, Major Macdonnel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Excuse <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> you," [...] said Captain Bervie. [...] "I am {{a member}} of the committee, charged with the {{arrangements}} of the ball, and I must really attend to my duties." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My friend," [...] I said, [...] "pardon <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> you; {{but there}} will be no sleep for us to-night if we have any more stories about spirits from the other world." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Forgive <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> you, my dear fellow," [...] he said. [...] "We {{are having}} our coffee outside, {{just on the}} left there. Miss Thorpe-Hatton wants you to stop {{for a moment on}} your way out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] I interrupted, [...] "excuse <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> you, but how {{has this}} been brought about? The {{obstacles}} you told me of on Saturday appeared even {{to me to be}} quite insurmountable; how has it been contrived?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pardon <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> you, {{but it is}} very {{important}} that I should understand the position exactly before you go farther. Whatever this matter may be of which you are about to tell me, do I understand that it was one entirely between Miss Hawtrey and yourself?' ...|$|E

60|$|With {{that brief}} explanation, I apologized <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> the reader, and Morgan began once more.|$|R
60|$|ERNEST. But, my dear fellow--excuse <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> you--you {{seem to me}} to be {{allowing}} {{your passion}} for criticism to lead you a great deal too far. For, after all, even you must admit that it is much more difficult to do a thing than to talk about it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> you," [...] said King Kaliko, {{coming to}} their side, [...] "but {{now that we}} have rescued Shaggy's brother I would like to return to my royal cavern. Being the King of the Nomes, it is my duty to look after my restless {{subjects}} and see that they behave themselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Edie," [...] I said, laying {{powerful}} restraint on myself, {{and looking}} her calmly in the face, [...] "you must {{bear with me}} to-night. You know that weakness sometimes causes men to act unaccountably. Forgive <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> you. I won't do it again, as the naughty boys say.--Go on, dear, with your story." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] I continued, [...] "it is even myself! Pardon <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> so {{agreeable}} a tête-à-tête, but you know, my good fellow, we owe a first duty to Mr. Robbie. It {{would never}} do to risk making a scene in the man's drawing-room; {{so the first thing}} I had to attend to was to have you warned. The name I go by is Ducie, too, in case of accidents." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> you, madam," [...] cried Mr. Collins; [...] "but if she {{is really}} headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would {{altogether}} be a very desirable wife {{to a man in}} my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir, forgive <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> you, {{but you are}} not {{shooting}} at those wood-pigeons in the right way. Although they seem to hover just before they settle, they are dropping much faster than you think. Your keeper was mistaken when he said that you knocked a feather out of the tail of that last bird at which you fired two barrels. In both cases you shot at least a foot above it, and what fell was a leaf from the ilex tree." ...|$|E

60|$|In that idle {{position}} {{he could hardly}} complain of <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> him, if I ventured {{to talk about the}} letters which I had put together. If my curiosity displeased him, he had only to say so, and there would be an end to any allusions of mine to the subject. My first idea was to join him at the window. On reflection, and still perceiving that he kept his back turned on me, I thought it might be more prudent to remain at the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed. He was too gentle a jailer for the Council. They {{have given}} her Sir Amias Paulett, a mere Puritan and Leicestrian, who is as hard as the nether millstone, and well-nigh as dull," [...] said Babington, with a little {{significant}} chuckle, which perhaps alarmed one of his companions, a small slight man with a slight halt, clad in black like a lawyer. [...] "Mr. Babington," [...] he said, [...] "pardon <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>interrupting</b> you, but we shall make Mr. Gage tarry supper for us." ...|$|E

[...] "I happen to have seen the clock at Strasbourg; and it sounds almost absurd in my ears (if you will pardon me for saying so) to put my little experiment in any light of comparison with that wonderful achievement. There is nothing else of the kind like it in the world!" [...] He paused, to control his own mounting enthusiasm; the clock at Strasbourg was to Major Milroy what the name of Michael Angelo was to Sir Joshua Reynolds. [...] "Mr. Armadale's kindness has led him to exaggerate a little," [...] pursued the major, smiling at Allan, and passing over another attempt of Midwinter's to seize on the talk, as if no such attempt had been made. [...] "But as there does happen to be this one point of resemblance between the great clock abroad and the little clock at home, that they both show {{what they can do}} on the stroke of noon, and as it is close on twelve now, if you still wish to visit my workshop, Mr. Midwinter, the sooner I show you the way to it the better." [...] He opened the door, and apologized to Midwinter, with marked ceremony, for preceding him out of the room.|$|E

40|$|<b>Interrupts</b> are {{important}} <b>for</b> writing robust, modular programs, but are traditionally {{viewed as being}} difficult from a semantic perspective. In this article we present a simple, formally justified, semantics <b>for</b> <b>interrupts.</b> Our approach is to consider a minimal high-level language and a minimal low-level machine with support <b>for</b> <b>interrupts,</b> give each a semantics, and then relate these semantics via a compiler. In this manner we obtain two different perspectives on the problem, formally shown to be equivalent, which gives greater confidence in the correctness of our semantics. ...|$|R
