30|$|Nowadays, it is {{completely}} accepted that human resource is the main element in knowledge management productivity (Zahedi and Tejari 2008). <b>Many</b> <b>empirical</b> <b>research</b> results have <b>showed</b> that KM have great influence on organizational outcomes in terms of innovation, product quality, and improvement of employees morale (Alzoubi and Alnajjar 2010; Sireteanu and Grigoruta 2007; Pentland 2003). Creation of a favorable work environment and securing high levels of trust among employees and employer-employee relationships are crucial factors in knowledge sharing (Kurtoğlu 2007). In order to avoid losing the qualified employees or to minimize prospective loss of leaving employees organizations must transform the individual knowledge possessed by the employees into organizational knowledge. Rendering organizational commitment among employees {{is one of the}} most important ways. Alzoubi and Alnajjar (2010) studied KM architecture tsted a set of variables related to Knowledge management revealed that the pillars of knowledge management architecture consist of strategy and commitment, information systems, culture, and communication. Knowledge management requires a major shift and commitment of everyone in the oranization in adopting each factor of knowledge management to make it works (Gupta et al. 2000). Working together as a team on various projects has developed a good culture and commitment among auditors that encourage knowledge application and dissemination.|$|R
40|$|Corruption in the {{healthcare}} sector is a widespread problem in <b>many</b> countries. <b>Empirical</b> <b>research</b> has <b>shown</b> that petty corruption is especially endemic in healthcare, perhaps due {{to the importance of}} health to human beings. In this thesis I will study the transmission of informal payments for health care between patients and physicians and its effect on patient welfare, taking social norms about corruption into account. A Monte Carlo estimation is used to estimate patient welfare and health outcomes of an iterated two-stage game where a new physician-patient pair meets in every stage of the game. I will simulate three cases. A benchline case where informal payments are non-existing and two cases where informal payments exist, one where the social norm is not to pay an informal payment for health care and one where the social norm is to pay an informal payment for health care. In the model, patients can be severely ill or mildly ill and be able to borrow for informal payments or not. The results show that even if traditional measures of welfare go down as corruption goes up, health outcomes improve when informal payments for health care are introduced and increase when patients are mildly ill, physicians are forward looking and have only one shot at offering patients a contract (i. e. no bargaining takes place).

40|$|Cooperative {{power is}} {{critical}} knowledge in traditional projects Projects that are executed {{in the home}} country of the initiating organization or company (traditional projects) face important challenges that result from the tensions between internal actors, such as suppliers, contractors and sub-suppliers. <b>Research</b> <b>shows</b> that the actors often rather compete than cooperate. Collaboration and communication skills are essential to increasing the efficiency of project execution. Project delays, conflicts and cost overruns can {{be the result of}} failing to understand this requirement. “Cooperative power” is a concept that emphasizes this need. Competitive power and competitiveness have been studied and presented in management courses for <b>many</b> years, but <b>empirical</b> <b>research</b> <b>shows</b> the need for something different in the execution of large scale projects: cooperative power and cooperativeness. Collaboration and communication across organizational borders are demanding, whether internally in an organization, between organizations or with the external surroundings, and good projects might fail because of a limited understanding of cooperative power. The power of the authorities and legislation is underrated in global projects In global projects the power of the authorities and government in different countries are clearly underrated. Relationship building with the external stakeholders, such as domestic authorities, legislation and government, is needed. Global projects require project managers and staff that have RQ (relationship intelligence) in addition to the more widely used IQ, EQ (emotional intelligence) and CQ (cultural intelligence). New models developed There is a tremendous body of knowledge available on traditional project management, e. g. literature on project risk and control, but the literature on the organizational and relationship side of projects is rather scarce. This thesis presents several new models that can be applied in project execution to reduce organizational challenges...|$|R
