In this paper, we develop a new worst-case bound on {{the expected}} shortfall when the univariate <b>marginals</b> are known exactly and additional expert information is available in terms of bivariate <b>marginals.</b> Such expert information allows for one to choose from among the many possible parametric families of bivariate copulas. By considering a neighborhood of distance ρ around the bivariate <b>marginals</b> with the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure, we model the trade-off between conservatism in the worst-case risk measure and confidence in the expert information. Our bound is developed when the only information available on the bivariate <b>marginals</b> forms a tree structure in which case it is efficiently computable using convex optimization.

The entropy theory has been extensively applied to derive the most probable univariate distribution subject to specified constraints by applying the principle of maximum entropy. With the flexibility to model nonlinear dependence structure, parametric copulas (e.g., Archimedean, extreme value, meta-elliptical, etc.) have been applied to multivariate modeling in water engineering. This study evaluates the copula–entropy theory using a sample dataset with known population information and a flood dataset from the experimental watershed at the Walnut Gulch, Arizona. The study finds the following: (1) both univariate and joint distributions can be derived using the entropy theory. (2) The parametric copula fits the true copula better using empirical <b>marginals</b> than using fitted parametric/entropy-based <b>marginals.</b> This suggests that <b>marginals</b> and copula may be identified separately in which the copula is investigated with empirical <b>marginals.</b> (3) For a given set of constraints, the most entropic canonical copula (MECC) is unique and independent of the <b>marginals.</b> This allows the universal solution for the proposed analysis.

40|$|The {{generation}} of multivariate probability distributions follows several approaches. Within financial applications the emphasis has mostly been on two methodologies. The {{first is the}} elliptical methodology, where the leap from univariate to multivariate has taken place by constructing density functions that are functions of quadratic forms of the <b>marginals.</b> The second is the copula philosophy, where the dependency structure is treated entirely separately from <b>marginals.</b> In financial applications one often needs to work with combinations of <b>marginals</b> of various distributional types, and the copula philosophy is very attractive as it copes well with heterogeneous <b>marginals.</b> However, with some notable exceptions, the copula approach does not normally correspond to any natural or canonical multivariate structure arising from some underlying dynamic. This paper presents an approach to multivariate distribution theory that allows for heterogeneous <b>marginals</b> but without {{the limitations of the}} elliptical ansatz or the arbitrariness of the copula approach. The approach is to consider multivariate distributions as arising naturally from coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and in this paper we consider a first step based on the equilibrium situation. The scope of this paper is where the <b>marginals</b> are one of the classic Pearson family of distributions, allowing for great diversity among the <b>marginals.</b> For simplicity we present details for the bivariate case. Using a recently developed quantile form of the Fokker-Planck equation it is first shown how the members of the Pearson family are associated with various types of one-dimensional SDE in a transparent manner. Then appropriate two-dimensional SDEs and the associated Fokker-Planck equations are considered. In the equilibrium limit these give solutions that are natural bivariate structures.
