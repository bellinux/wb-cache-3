It cited Andrew Ryder, a theologian at All Hallows College in Dublin, who wrote, [...] "While he may not use the language of traditional Christian spirituality, Tolle is very much concerned that, as we <b>make</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> through the ordinary events of the day, we keep in touch with the deepest source of our being." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 1890 Nansen {{addressed}} {{a meeting of}} the Norwegian Geographical Society in Oslo (then called Christiania). After drawing attention to the failures of the many expeditions which had approached the North Pole from the west, he considered the implications of the discovery of the Jeannette items, along with further finds of driftwood and other debris from Siberia or Alaska that had been identified along the Greenland coast. [...] "Putting all this together," [...] Nansen said, [...] "we are driven to the conclusion that a current flows ... from the Siberian Arctic Sea to the east coast of Greenland," [...] probably passing across the Pole. It seemed that the obvious thing to do was [...] "to <b>make</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> into the current {{on that side of the}} Pole where it flows northward, and by its help to penetrate into those regions which all who have hitherto worked against [...] have sought in vain to reach." ...|$|E

50|$|The Good Lives Model (GLM), first {{proposed}} by Ward and Stewart and further developed by Ward and colleagues, is a strengths-based approach to offender rehabilitation that {{is responsive to}} offenders' particular interests, abilities, and aspirations. It also directs practitioners to explicitly construct intervention plans that help offenders to acquire the capabilities to achieve {{the things that are}} personally meaningful to them. It assumes that all individuals have similar aspirations and needs and that one of the primary responsibilities of parents, teachers, and the broader community is to help each of us acquire the tools required to <b>make</b> <b>our</b> own <b>way</b> in the world.|$|R
40|$|Economists, in {{the context}} of economics, do not {{distinguish}} between conscious and unconscious thought- I have heard some discuss the distinction {{in the context}} of their psychotherapy sessions. 1 But, psychologists find the distinction central to explaining choices, perceptions, and how we manage to <b>make</b> <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> through the world. 2 The unconscious, once limited to harboring our infantile Freudian traumas, now plays many roles. Much recent research in psychology and neurobiology suggests that our brain consists of many separate processing centers: one for conscious thought (“should I or shouldn’t I buy the Lexus and marry Shirley”) and many for unconscious tasks. Unconscious activities were once thought limited to such mundane activities as processing language, not falling over, and seeing what we see when we open our eyes – the stuff the conscious mind did not need to be bothered with. Now it is thought that our unconscious also plays a major role in many of the choices we make – my perception that a Lexus is better than a Ford, and my decision to drop Lois and get the new Lexus. 3 And, these different centers don’t always agree on the course of action. We are “not of one mind. ...|$|R
50|$|Golan Levin's artwork {{focuses on}} the design of systems for the creation, {{manipulation}} and performance of simultaneous image and sound, as part of a more general inquiry into formal languages of interactivity and of nonverbal communication in cybernetic systems. Through performances, digital artifacts, and virtual environments, often created with a variety of collaborators, Levin applies creative twists to digital technologies that highlight our relationship with machines, <b>make</b> visible <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> of interacting with each other, and explore the intersection of abstract communication and interactivity. Since 2002, Levin and Zachary Lieberman have collaborated on a variety of projects together, using the name Tmema to represent their collective work.|$|R

60|$|We {{had a long}} {{consultation}} here what {{we should}} do with the men, for to give them the ship, and let them pursue their voyage to Java, would be to alarm the Dutch factory there, who are by far the strongest in the Indies, and to <b>make</b> <b>our</b> passage that <b>way</b> impracticable; whereas we resolved to visit {{that part of the world}} in <b>our</b> <b>way,</b> but were not willing to pass the great Bay of Bengal, where we hoped for a great deal of purchase; and therefore it behoved us not to be waylaid before we came there, because they knew we must pass by the Straits of Malacca, or those of Sunda; and either way it was very easy to prevent us.|$|R

Global crisis is not only economic; it is politically constructed in different ways, depending on state, region and history. The most problematic effect of the actual crisis is the increasing unemployment, so that, the first aim {{of this paper is}} to estimate the evolution of the unemployment costs in period 2002 - 2009. Secondly, based on information from National Institute of Statistics (NIS), National Agency for Employment (NAE), Eurostat and in correlation with specific literature and Romanian government decisions we make a forecast of the unemployment costs for the next two years. We tried to reveal the fact that some of government decisions in crisis period can aggravate the situation and not support the economic recovery. crisis, unemployment, Romania...|$|R

They <b>make</b> <b>our</b> own particular <b>ways</b> of understanding <b>our</b> language visible and enable us to survey (übersehen) its grammar.

The book draws extensively from research conducted by members of the BC-Alberta Social Economy Research Alliance (BALTA) and others over the 2006 - 2012 period.
