40|$|The {{common and}} {{easy access to}} {{technological}} devices {{has led to the}} rapid inclusion of technology into the learning process. The development of technical skills, as well as the increasing confidence in computer attitudes, seems to be obvious. We therefore propose to go beyond and advocate the use of TEL to provide specific leadership, <b>multi-tasking</b> <b>and</b> other <b>organizational</b> <b>skills,</b> known as computational thinking, as precisely the main contributions provided by TEL. To support this hypothesis, we present two different experiences. The first, based on high-school students, to introduce young people to technology {{at the same time as}} they acquire other demanding skills. The second, with undergraduate Computer Science students, is focused on technology itself to enhance and improve computational thinking skills. A comparison is also made between two populations with different digital profiles in their user skills (general in the first case and engineering biased in the second).

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} gender-sensitive correlation between the communicative <b>and</b> <b>organizational</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> the professional performance of managers in commercial organization. The topicality of research is preconditioned {{by the fact that}} today an increasing number of women get the senior positions in business in Russia. The article submits and analyses the results of the empirical research that took place in a commercial organization (managers of clothes and accessories retail shops). Store managers of this organization took part in the research, including 82 male and 231 female. The age of the respondents ranged from 21 to 42 years old. The work experience of the managers was no less than one year. The communicative <b>and</b> <b>organizational</b> <b>skills</b> were measured {{with the help of the}} test-questionnaire “Communication <b>and</b> <b>organizational</b> skills” (COS) worked out by V. V. Sinyavsky and B. A. Fedorishin. The professional effectiveness was determined by two indicators: 1) the implementation of shop sales plan in 2014 and in 2015, 2) the results of expert estimates obtained using the feedback from “ 360 Degrees”. The results of correlation analysis demonstrated the strong relations between the manifestation of communicative <b>and</b> <b>organizational</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> the indicators of professional effectiveness, received by using the feedback from “ 360 Degrees” in both male and female groups of respondents. At the same time, the implementation of shop sales plan in 2014 also showed a strong positive relationship with <b>organizational</b> <b>and</b> communicative <b>skills</b> especially in female group.

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to the problem of management and understanding features in communication depending on level of emotional intelligence. The emotional intelligence plays essential role in success of interpersonal communication and, as a result, in formation of interpersonal relations, including management activity as the leader. We made the assumption that as higher EI level is, than level of communicative, <b>organizational</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> empathy is high during communicative process. We studied the understanding and management features of other person depending on level of emotional intelligence. The research findings showed that certain level of EI has impact on a level of communicative <b>and</b> <b>organizational</b> <b>skills</b> during communication. It has positive correlation between a level of EI and a level of communicative skills. Correctly developed emotional intelligence creates conditions for communicative <b>and</b> <b>organizational</b> <b>skills</b> formation. as higher EI development level is, than level of communicative, <b>organizational</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> empathy is high during communicative process.

Aim {{of the study was to}} examine correlation of cognitive functions with some aspects of illness, treatment and social functioning in a group of recurrently hospitalized schizophrenic patients (N= 60). Deficient results on psychomotor processing speed, verbal fluency and verbal learning correlated with the longer duration of illness, higher number of hospitalizations and shorter duration of regular antipsychotic treatment. Deficient results on verbal fluency correlated with the younger age of onset, poor functional autonomy <b>and</b> <b>organizational</b> <b>skills,</b> whereas deficient results on psychomotor processing and verbal learning correlated with poor <b>organizational</b> <b>skills</b> alone. Score on verbal fluency was predictive of social skills impairment, whereas score on psychomotor processing was predictive of functional autonomy <b>and</b> <b>organizational</b> <b>skills</b> impairment.
