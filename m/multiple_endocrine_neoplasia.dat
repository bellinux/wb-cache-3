To derive an animal model {{that will allow us to}} define some of these phenomena at the molecular level, we have chosen to induce the expression of a viral oncogene in all tissue types, with the hope of identifying sites that are more susceptible to malignant transformation. When the gene for simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (T antigen) was placed under the control of a major histocompatibility complex class I gene enhancer, the resulting transgenic mice not only developed choroid plexus papillomas, as seen with wild-type simian virus 40, but also lymphoid hyperplasia and <b>multiple</b> <b>endocrine</b> <b>neoplasias.</b> The development of lymphoid hyperplasia was preceded by an elevated level of expression of T antigen in these tissues at an early age.

The <b>multiple</b> <b>endocrine</b> <b>neoplasias</b> developed later in life and involved the pancreas, pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, and testes. While not preceded by an elevated level of expression of T antigen, once endocrine tumors appeared they quickly progressed toward malignant growth.

25|$|Mutations (DNA changes) in the RET proto-oncogene, {{located on}} {{chromosome}} 10, {{lead to the}} expression of a mutated receptor tyrosine kinase protein, termed RET (REarranged during Transfection). RET is involved in the regulation of cell growth and development and its germline mutation is responsible for nearly all cases of hereditary or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. Its germline mutation may also be responsible for the development of hyperparathyroidism and pheochromocytoma. Hereditary medullary thyroid cancer is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, meaning that each child of an affected parent has a 50% probability of inheriting the mutant RET proto-oncogene from the affected parent. DNA analysis makes it possible to identify children who carry the mutant gene; surgical removal of the thyroid in children who carry the mutant gene is curative if the entire thyroid gland is removed at an early age, before there is spread of the tumor. The parathyroid tumors and pheochromocytomas are removed when they cause clinical symptomatology.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Multiple</b> <b>endocrine</b> <b>neoplasias</b> type 2 A (MEN 2 A) is a dominantly {{inherited}} cancer syndrome. Missence mutations in the codon encoding cysteine 634 of the ret proto-oncogene {{have been found}} in 85 % of the MEN 2 A families. The main tumour type always present in MEN 2 A is medullar thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Only 25 % of all MTC are hereditary, and generally they are identified by a careful family history. However, some familial MTCs are not easily detected by this means and underdiagnosis of MEN 2 A is suspected. Methods DNA samples from MEN 2 A patients were amplified by PCR. The products were incubated with the restriction enzyme Bst ApI or Bgl I. The samples were loaded in non-denaturing 10 % Polyacrilamyde Gel and run at 120 volts for 40 min. The gels were stained with 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and the bands were visualized under a UV lamp. Results We developed a PCR-mutagenic method to check the integrity of the three bases of the cysteine 634 codon. Conclusion The method can be used to detect inherited mutations in MTC patients without a clear family history. The method is relatively simple to use as a routine test in these patients to decrease the underdiagnosis of MEN 2 A. In addition, the assay can be used to screen affected families with any mutation in cysteine 634. </p...|$|R

An effective population-based screening program can give reliable data on over-all malignancy profile. An 8 -year (2003 - 2010) multi-centre based study was assessed to understand the malignancy profile in the population of West Bengal. The cancer frequency was moderate during 2003 to 2006, after that it rises drastically and reached maximum peak in 2010. The most frequently affected organs were breast, cervix, stomach, lung, oesophagus, ovary, cheek, prostrate, liver and pancreas, gall bladder and tongue. The incidence in rural areas was slightly low compared to more polluted urban counterparts. Malignancies are in epidemic peak in this population with new cancer cases and greater increase among females. The largest threat among females was seen for breast and cervix cancer, among males for prostate cancer. Among children of age group below 10 years non hodgkins lymphoma was alarmingly high, followed by acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myelocytic leukemia. Exposure to various environmental toxicants, industrial wastages, asbestos dusts, colored agricultural commodities and food products incredibly elevate the levels of malignant risk and status.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia has been previously reported in patients with Turner syndrome. Although insulinomas {{are the most common}} type of functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor and have been reported in patients with <b>multiple</b> <b>endocrine</b> <b>neoplasias,</b> the tumors have not been reported in patients with mosaic Turner syndrome. The present study reports the first case of an insulinoma in a patient with 45 XO/ 47 XXX mosaic Turner syndrome. The patient suffered from recurrent hypoglycemia, which was relieved following ingestion of glucose or food. A 5 -h glucose tolerance test was performed and the levels of glucose, C-Peptide and insulin were detected. In addition, computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound scanning were performed to evaluate the possibility of an insulinoma. Pathological examina-tion and karyotyping were performed on a surgical specimen and a whole blood sample, respectively. The patient was found to suffer from premature ovarian failure, and a physical exami-nation was consistent with a diagnosis of Turner syndrome. An ultrasound scan demonstrated streak ovaries and the patient was found to have a 45 XO/ 47 XXX karyotype. Furthermore, a lesion was detected in the pancreas following CT scanning, which was identified as an insulinoma following surgical removal and histological examination. In conclusion, the present study reports the first case of an insulinoma in a patient with mosaic Turner syndrome.

MÉTODOS: realizou-se estudo de caso institucional, retrospectivo, via revisão de prontuários de pacientes com DH atendidos no Instituto Fernandes Figueira entre 1993 e 2003. RESULTADOS: Em um total de 55 pacientes, 98 % apresentaram sintomas neonatais, sendo 47, 2 % diagnosticados nesse período; em 88, 9 % o enema baritado foi conclusivo; 69 % tinham DH de segmento curto; 16, 3 % síndrome de Down; 15, 2 % outras anomalias congênitas; 40 % foram rastreados para mutações RET associadas a neoplasias endócrinas múltiplas (MEN 2 A), não sendo detectada nenhuma; 63, 6 % fizeram abaixamento estagiado do colon/íleo; 12, 72 % abaixamento endoretal transanal primário; as principais complicações cirúrgicas foram sepse, enterocolite e obstrução intestinal; distúrbios da defecação foram detectados anos pós-cirurgia; a taxa de letalidade foi 9, 25 %; os óbitos relacionaram-se a enterocolite e sepse pós-operatórias.

To assess the risk associated with polymorphism rs 2066827 (p 27 -V 109 G), we genotyped a large cohort of Brazilian patients with sporadic endocrine tumors (pituitary adenomas, n= 252; pheochromocytomas, n= 125; medullary thyroid carcinoma, n= 51; and parathyroid adenomas, n= 19) and 885 population- matched healthy controls and determined the odds ratios and 95 % CIs. Significant associations were found for the group of patients with pituitary adenomas (P= 0. 01), particularly for those with ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas (P= 0. 005). in contrast, no association was found with GH- secreting pituitary tumors alone or with the sporadic counterpart of MEN 2 - component neoplasias. Our in vitro analyses revealed increased colony formation and cell growth rate for an AtT 20 corticotropin mouse cell line overexpressing the p 27 - V 109 G variant compared with cells transfected with the WT p 27. However, the genotypic effects in genetic and in vitro approaches were divergent. in accordance with our genetic data showing specificity for ACTH- secreting pituitary tissues, the overexpression of p 27 -V 109 G in a GH 3 somatotropin rat cell line resulted in no difference compared with the WT.

40|$|Families with an {{autosomal}} dominant predisposition to benign or malignant tumours {{were identified in}} Newfoundland in the 1980 s, including families with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), the <b>multiple</b> <b>endocrine</b> <b>neoplasias,</b> type 1 (MEN- 1), and type 2 (MEN- 2), and the hereditary colon cancers, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC). Each family was identified because of an excess of early deaths and disabilities in family members who had presented with symptomatic disease, and an increased anxiety in affected and unaffected family members. [...] The medical team recognized that a multidisciplinary approach to the disease in each family was necessary to improve the prognosis, and that a screening program might be central {{to this type of}} care. [...] Successful genetic screening programs had been developed since the 1960 s for severe or lethal hereditary diseases with neonatal or early childhood onset: for early identification and treatment of affected infants, or for identification of those at risk of having an affected child with provision of counselling to allow informed reproductive decisions. Subsequently predictive testing for incurable late-onset diseases, such as Huntington disease, was introduced to reduce uncertainty. Many lessons were learned from these early screening programs, about the ethical requirements of screening for hereditary disease, and the need for coordination with pre-screening and post-screening education, counselling, and follow-up. [...] In the 1980 s there were recommendations for screening programs for hereditary tumour syndromes, for early identification of gene carriers to provide reproductive counselling, and for early identification and treatment of tumours to improve the prognosis. At the same time there were concerns that more harm than good might result from this type of program. The large Newfoundland families with VHL, MEN- 1, MEN- 2, FAP and HNPCC provided an opportunity to develop, implement, and then evaluate clinical and genetic screening programs for these hereditary tumour syndromes. [...] For each "hereditary cancer" an extended pedigree was documented and medical records reviewed. A clinical screening protocol was developed based on the type of tumours and ages at which they occurred. Educational materials were prepared, counselling was provided, and clinical screening was offered to affected and at-risk family members. Medical and psychosocial results of screening were documented. Genetic testing by linkage analysis or mutation detection was developed in collaboration with molecular geneticists in Newfoundland and elsewhere, and predictive testing was offered to at-risk family members. Affected and unaffected members of the VHL family were interviewed to assess the psychosocial implications of the disease and the screening program, and a formal health care evaluation was completed for the VHL screening program, including a cost-benefit analysis. [...] For VHL, an earlier age at diagnosis, an improved prognosis (reduced morbidity and mortality), and a better quality of life (reduced anxiety, and more informed reproductive decisions) were demonstrated for those identified by screening, compared with those presenting symptomatically. The overall cost to society of screening and management of presymptomatic disease was less than the combined costs of treatment of symptomatic disease and the costs related to early deaths and disabilities. Screening programs for the other hereditary tumour syndromes were less formally reviewed, but provided similar results. [...] As a group these hereditary cancers differed from untreatable adult-onset disorders because the harmful effects of the disease genes could be mitigated. At the same time, important differences were identified within this group of diseases (the age at onset, severity of disease, the spectrum of disease expression, the potential for treatment, and the state of genetic knowledge) which influenced the development of specific screening programs, and the attitudes of family members towards participation in the clinical and genetic components of screening.
