5000|$|Like all <b>marmots,</b> Vancouver Island <b>marmots</b> live in burrows and are obligate herbivores. Vancouver Island <b>marmots</b> {{have been}} {{documented}} to eat over 30 species of food plants, generally shifting from grasses {{in the early spring}} to plants such as lupines in late summer. [...] <b>Marmots</b> hibernate for various amounts of time depending upon site characteristics and annual weather conditions. Wild Vancouver Island <b>marmots</b> hibernate, on average, for about 210 days of the year, generally from late September or early October until late April or early May. They generally hibernate for shorter periods in captivity.|$|R
40|$|Animals {{generally}} allocate {{some time}} during foraging to detecting predators. We used {{a combination of}} observations and an experiment to examine how vegetation height and peripheral obstructions influence vigilance by foraging yellow-bellied <b>marmots</b> (Marmota flaviventris). First, we analyzed a large sample of observations of <b>marmots</b> foraging in nature. <b>Marmots</b> increased vigilance with vegetation height and reared on their hind legs when in tall vegetation. Second, we observed that <b>marmots</b> foraged in locations with lower vegetation than randomly selected sites in the same meadow. These observations suggest that <b>marmots</b> account for what they can see while foraging but do {{not rule out the}} influence of other factors correlated with vegetation height. Therefore, we experimentally blocked the view for 3 sides for <b>marmots</b> feeding on a controlled food source. When the apparatus blocked their vigilance, <b>marmots</b> were less vigilant when foraging, often moved outside the apparatus, and showed heightened vigilance while outside the apparatus. Peripheral obstructions explained more of the variance in our experimental than in our observational results. Together, our results demonstrate that <b>marmots</b> employ antipredator behavior to compensate for peripheral obstructions. Long-term studies show that <b>marmots</b> go locally extinct more often in areas with more obstructions to vigilance. Thus, <b>marmots</b> likely face greater predation risk in those areas, despite the behavioral responses documented in this study. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

5|$|Washington's first {{official}} symbol was its flag, adopted in 1923. While some symbols, including the state flower and state seal, were selected before then, {{they were not}} adopted by the Legislature until later. Washington's second symbol was western hemlock, selected as the state tree in 1947. Fourteen symbols were added between 1950 and 2000. Five symbols have been adopted in the 21st century. The newest symbol of Washington is the Olympic <b>marmot,</b> declared the state endemic mammal in 2009.|$|E
5|$|As the {{landscape}} rises, trees become {{smaller and more}} sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite. These include lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, and mountain hemlock that, at highest elevations, give way to vast expanses of granite as treeline is reached. The climate in these habitats is harsh and the growing season is short, but species such as pika, yellow-bellied <b>marmot,</b> white-tailed jackrabbit, Clark's nutcracker, and black rosy finch are adapted to these conditions. Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.|$|E
5|$|Elk (also {{known as}} wapiti), mule deer, and {{pronghorn}} (also called pronghorn antelope) {{are some of}} the most commonly seen large mammals. During winter, pronghorn that spend the summer in the Sawtooth Valley migrate south to the lower elevations on the Snake River Plain, and some sections of the forest are closed to motorized use to protect the elk winter range. Bighorn sheep are rare sights in the forest, but the forest contains one-third of Idaho's mountain goat population, and they are commonly seen at high elevations in the Boulder, White Cloud, Pioneer, and Sawtooth mountains. Other mammals in the forest include the coyote, moose, bobcat, beaver, yellow-bellied <b>marmot,</b> pika, and badger.|$|E
50|$|Its {{inhabitants}} {{are called}} <b>Marmots.</b>|$|R
50|$|Olympic <b>marmots</b> {{start to}} enter {{hibernation}} in early September. Before hibernating, the <b>marmots</b> bring dry grasses into the burrow for bedding or food. Sometimes in early September <b>marmots</b> {{will stay in}} their burrows for a few consecutive days, with only brief outings that allow for a little foraging. During this period, they do not play fight or socialize with other marmots; they limit themselves to peeking out and casually sitting outside their burrows. Nonparous females (those who have not given birth yet) and adult males become inactive first, {{because they do not}} need to store as much fat beforehand. The parous females, yearlings, and young of the year become inactive a few weeks later, because they have to gain more weight. The <b>marmots</b> of a colony hibernate in a single burrow space, which they keep closed with dirt. Adults emerge in May, and the young in June. <b>Marmots</b> do not eat during hibernation, so they have to store fat before becoming inactive.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} {{susceptible}} to climate change because of their sensitivity to changed habitats. When meadows in Olympic National Park dried out, <b>marmots</b> there died or moved. In the long term, meadows may be superseded by forests. Climate change will alter the timing, composition, {{and quality of the}} marmots' food. Olympic <b>marmots</b> can become more vulnerable to predators when daytime temperatures rise too high for foraging, causing them to forage in the cooler evenings when predators are more difficult to notice. In warm winters, there is heavier predation by coyotes. <b>Marmots</b> become more accessible to coyotes as lower banks of snow allow coyotes to move up higher on mountains where <b>marmots</b> dwell, into areas which they could not usually reach during an average cold winter. Climate change could also have positive effects; a warmer climate would result in a longer growing season in which <b>marmots</b> could mature more quickly and thus breed more often.|$|R
5|$|Sixty-one {{species of}} mammals have been {{recorded}} in Grand Teton National Park. This includes the gray wolf, which had been extirpated from the region by the early 1900s but migrated into the Grand Teton National Park from adjacent Yellowstone National Park after the species had been reintroduced there. The re-establishment of the wolves has ensured that every indigenous mammal species now exists in the park. In addition to gray wolves, another 17 species of carnivores reside within Grand Teton National Park including grizzlies and the more commonly seen American black bear. Relatively common sightings of coyote, river otter, marten and badger and occasional sightings of cougar, Canadian lynx and wolverine are reported annually. A number of rodent species exist including yellow-bellied <b>marmot,</b> least chipmunk, muskrat, beaver, Uinta ground squirrel, pika, snowshoe hare, porcupine, and six species of bats.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} 56 {{recorded}} mammal species. Grizzly and black bear inhabit the forested regions. Cougar, Canada lynx, wolverine, red fox, weasel, river otter, coyote, and timber wolf {{are the primary}} predatory mammals. Elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer are common in the valleys of the park, including around (and sometimes in) the Banff townsite, while moose {{tend to be more}} elusive, sticking primarily to wetland areas and near streams. In the alpine regions, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, <b>marmot</b> and pika are widespread. Other mammals such as beaver, porcupine, squirrel, chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and Columbian ground squirrel are the more commonly observed smaller mammals. Caribou were the rarest large mammals in the park, but an avalanche in 2009 may have killed the last five remaining within park boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Adaptations of Gibson's fiction have {{frequently}} been optioned and proposed, to limited success. Two of the author's short stories, both {{set in the}} Sprawl trilogy universe, have been loosely adapted as films: Johnny Mnemonic (1995) with screenplay by Gibson and starring Keanu Reeves, Dolph Lundgren and Takeshi Kitano, and New Rose Hotel (1998), starring Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, and Asia Argento. The former {{was the first time}} in history that a book was launched simultaneously as a film and a CD-ROM interactive video game. , Vincenzo Natali still hoped to bring Neuromancer to the screen, after some years in development hell. Count Zero was at one point being developed as The Zen Differential with director Michael Mann attached, and the third novel in the Sprawl trilogy, Mona Lisa Overdrive, has also been optioned and bought. An anime adaptation of Idoru was announced as in development in 2006, and Pattern Recognition was in the process of development by director Peter Weir, although according to Gibson the latter is no longer attached to the project. Announced at International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2015 is an adaptation of Gibson's short story Dogfight by BAFTA award-winning writer and director Simon Pummell. Written by Gibson and Michael Swanwick and first published in Omni in July 1985, the film is being developed by British producer Janine <b>Marmot</b> at Hot Property Films.|$|E

40|$|I {{observed}} hoary <b>marmots</b> {{for three}} field seasons {{to determine how}} the distribution of food and the risk of predation influenced marmots' foraging behavior.

50|$|Male Alaska <b>marmots</b> are polygynous, mating {{with the}} monogamous females living on their territory. They are {{seasonal}} iteroparous and viviparous breeders that mate once per {{in the early}} spring and give birth about six week later with litter sizes ranging from 3 to 8 and an average litter size of 4-5. The male and female Alaska <b>marmots</b> are involved in both raising and protecting the pups in their natal burrow. In both sexes sexual reproductive behaviors are stimulated by odors released from anal scent glands. Before birthing, the female will first close her den off and then she will give birth alone. The Gestation period is about 5-6 weeks. Newly born Alaskan <b>marmots</b> are altricial; hairless, toothless, blind and are quite vulnerable to predators. After about six weeks young <b>marmots</b> have thick, soft fur and they begin to temporarily leave the den. They will go through 3 coats in their first year until their final one, which resembles adult Alaska <b>marmots.</b> They will hibernate and live with their parents at least one year, they will be fully-grown after two years and reach sexual maturity from 2 to 3 years. <b>Marmots</b> life span are not known but it is believed to be about 13-15 years.|$|R
5|$|Also in 1994, United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt first {{proposed}} {{the removal of}} several Pacific Northwest dams because of their impact on salmon spawning. The Northwest Power Planning Council approved a plan that provided more water for fish and less for electricity, irrigation, and transportation. Environmental advocates have called {{for the removal of}} certain dams in the Columbia system in the years since. Of the 227major dams in the Columbia River drainage basin, the four Washington dams on the lower Snake River are often identified for removal, for example in an ongoing lawsuit concerning a Bush administration plan for salmon recovery. These dams and reservoirs limit the recovery of upriver salmon runs to Idaho's Salmon and Clearwater rivers. Historically, the Snake produced over 1.5million spring and summer Chinook salmon, a number that has dwindled to several thousand in recent years. Idaho Power Company's Hells Canyon dams have no fish ladders (and do not pass juvenile salmon downstream), and thus allow no steelhead or salmon to migrate above Hells Canyon. In 2007, the destruction of the <b>Marmot</b> Dam on the Sandy River was the first dam removal in the system. Other Columbia Basin dams that have been removed include Condit Dam on Washington's White Salmon River, and the Milltown Dam on the Clark Fork in Montana.|$|E
