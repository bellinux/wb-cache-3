40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of shielded metal arc welds, with varying compositions of carbon, manganese, and nickel were {{explained in terms}} of the relative amounts of different <b>microstructural</b> <b>constituents</b> BY E. KEEHAN, L. KARLSSON, H. -O. ANDRÉN, AND L. -E. SVENSSON ABSTRACT. Microstructure and properties have been studied for high-strength steel weld metals with variations in carbon, manganese, and nickel. Based on neural network modeling, experimental welds were made using shielded metal arc welding with manganese at 0. 5 or 2. 0 wt- % and nickel at 7 or 9 wt-%. Additional welds were made where carbon was varied between 0. 03 and 0. 11 wt-%. Generally there was very good agreement between the recorded mechanical properties and the neural network predictions. A combination of high nickel and manganese was positive for strength but very negative for impact toughness, while manganese reductions lead to large impact toughness increases. Carbon additions up to 0. 11 wt- % were found to increase yield strength to over 900 MPa while still maintaining toughness at over 60 J at – 100 °C. Mechanical {{properties of}} the weld metals could be rationalized in terms of their relative amounts of the different <b>microstructural</b> <b>constituents.</b> Martensite provided the highest strength and reasonable toughness. Upper and lower bainite contributed to very good toughness and high strength. The least beneficial properties were found in the high-manganese variants due to a combination of primarily coarse-grained coalesced bainite and martensite. This combination of <b>microstructural</b> <b>constituents</b> resulted in poor toughness, relatively high yield strength, and the highest tensile strength. Furthermore, increasing contents of manganese and nickel resulted in a significant lowering of Ac 1, thereby contributing to poorer impact toughness as a consequence of less tempering in reheated regions. The optimal combination of strength and impact toughness were found at 0. 5 manganes...|$|R

In this approach the macroscopic deformation gradient tensor and its gradient are imposed on a microstructural representative volume element (RVE).

Every <b>microstructural</b> <b>constituent</b> is modelled as a classical continuum and the RVE problem is formulated in terms of standard equilibrium and boundary conditions.

While formation of this constituent {{has been attributed to}} eutectic solidification, an alternative mechanism of discontinuous precipitation has been proposed. Using a representative grain-refined Pd-Cu-Ga dental alloy, casting procedures involving two different rates of solidification were used: (a) A standard thin-walled coping configuration for a metal-ceramic restoration was cast into a room temperature mold, followed by rapid quenching into an ice-water mixture. (b) A thin plate specimen was cast into a standard elevated-temperature mold, with the same subsequent rapid quenching procedure. Neither casting was subjected to the standard air-abrasion procedure following devesting that is used in dental laboratories. An outer surface layer, approximately one grain thick, containing only the palladium solid solution, was observed in the microstructures of the two different castings, and the eutectic constituent was present at greater depths. This observation is consistent with physical metallurgy principles for the freezing of an alloy containing a eutectic constituent, and the alternate hypothesis that the lamellar constituents might represent discontinuous precipitates has been discarded...|$|E

Each alloy was subjected to simulated recrystallization and nonrecrystallization rolling schedules, followed by controlled cooling at rates from 0. 1 °C/s to about 100 °C/s, and the corresponding continuous-cooling-transformation (CCT) diagrams were constructed. The resultant microstructures ranged from polygonal ferrite (PF) for combinations of slow cooling rates and low alloying element contents, through to bainitic ferrite accompanied by martensite for fast cooling rates and high concentrations of alloying elements. Combined additions of boron and molybdenum were found to be most effective in increasing steel hardenability, while boron was significantly more effective than molybdenum as a single addition, especially at the ultralow carbon content. Severe plastic deformation of the parent austenite (> 0. 45) markedly enhanced PF formation in those steels in which this <b>microstructural</b> <b>constituent</b> was formed, indicating a significant effective decrease in their hardenability.

40|$|Hydrogen {{assisted}} cracking (HAC) is {{a common}} type of failure mechanism that can affect {{a wide range of}} metals and alloys. Experimental studies of HAC are cumbersome due to various intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and factors (associated with stress, hydrogen and the materials microstructure) contributing to the hydrogen crack kinetics. The microstructure of many materials consists of diverse constituents with characteristic features and mechanical properties which only occur in very small material volumes. The only way to differentiate the effect of these individual constituents on the hydrogen crack kinetics is to miniaturise the testing procedures. In this paper we present a new experimental approach to investigate hydrogen assisted crack growth in a <b>microstructural</b> <b>constituent,</b> i. e. acicular ferrite. For this purpose, sharply notched micro-cantilevers were fabricated with a Focus Ion Beam within this selected microscopic region. Acicular ferrite can be found in many ferrous alloys including ferritic weld metal and has specific features that control its intrinsic susceptibility to HAC. These features were characterised via Electron Backscatter Diffraction and the specimens were subsequently loaded under uncharged and hydrogen charged conditions with a nano-indenter. The outcomes of the testing, demonstrated that the threshold stress intensity factor, Kth, to initiate crack propagation in acicular ferrite ranges between 1. 56 MPa m 1 / 2 and 4. 36 MPa m 1 / 2. This range is significantly below the values of Kth reported for various ferrous alloys in standard macro-tests. This finding indicates that the mechanisms and resistance to HAC at micro-scale could be very different than at the macro-scale as not all fracture toughening mechanisms may be activated at this scale level...|$|E

Consequently, cemented carbides have been positioned as suitable options when selecting materials for tribomechanical applications, and their implementation continues to gain a place in the market, particularly as structural components and forming tools. Mechanical properties of hardmetals, especially hardness and toughness, strongly depend on the nature, content and size of each <b>microstructural</b> <b>constituent.</b> The aim of this project is to carry out a microstructural and mechanical characterization of two different WC-Co grades with medium and coarse grain sizes and medium binder content, as well as to conduct a detailed study of crack-microstructure interactions at the crack tip during unstable crack propagation. Microstructural characterization includes grain size, binder content, contiguity and mean free path. Grain size distribution has been measured using two different techniques; by traditional linear interception and by image analysis. It is found that image analysis way give similar results in terms of mean carbide size and grain size distribution to those found with linear interception. An intensive study on the grain size distribution as a function of the number of measured grains has been also carried out. The effect of the microstructure on the mechanical properties is discussed on the basis of a fracture mechanics approach. Fracture of cemented carbides is governed by unstable propagation of pre-existing flaws; hence, Weibull statistics are implemented as an effective technique to evaluate the rupture strength and the reliability of the studied grades. After rupture, a detailed fractographic analysis is conducted in order to identify the nature, size and geometry of critical flaws. A detailed study of crack-microstructure interactions at the crack tip is assessed by cross-sectioning and imaging the crack tip using the SEM/FIB tomography technique. This investigation led to the conclusion that the microstructure of each grade has a determinant role since it affects directly the toughness and indirectly the size and distribution of intrinsic defects. On the other hand, fracture process at the crack tip is governed by the nucleation and growth of micro voids in the binder until it fractures by void coalescence...|$|E

Problems in evaluation of the chemical composition of these precipitates {{in the case of a}} high degree of the structure refinement were indicated...|$|R
40|$|The laser {{cladding}} technique {{was used to}} produce Ni alloy coatings with different SiC particle (SiCp) contents on steel 1045. The complete dissolution of SiCp took place during laser melting {{and led to a}} microstructural evolution of the coatings associated with the SiCp content. M 7 X 3 or M 23 X 6 -type carboborides and Ni-base solid solution are found as the main <b>microstructural</b> <b>constituents</b> of the clad layers, and the volume fraction of the carboborides increases with increasing SiCp content. When the SiCp content reaches 30 vol. %, a silicide of Ni 3 Si 2 phase and a few spherical graphite precipitates are observed, and the γ matrix shows a modulated structure. The addition of SiCp can significantly enhance the microhardness and wear resistance of the coatings. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of the {{presented}} paper was to describe deformation behaviour of the commercial purity titanium during the ECAP method. Attention was paid particularly on reached mechanical properties of above mentioned material. Design of experiments rested in extrusion at temperature in range from room temperature up to 280 °C. The way of approach was planned in investigation of imposed strain accumulation ability. Among used methods for determination of intended aims were tensile tests, TEM, SEM. Mechanical properties were evaluated using standard tensile tests as well as small punch tests. Correlation between mechanical properties from tensile test and punch test was developed. Depending on imposed strain (e = 2 up to 8) was found that mechanical properties (namely tensile strength) have increased up to 960 MPa. Developed ECAP process enables controlling morphology of <b>microstructural</b> <b>constituents</b> and workability of titanium Grade 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{modified}} SAE 4118 H steel {{was subjected}} to isothermal treatments between 700 °C and 400 ºC every 50 °C range, {{with the intention of}} evaluating the decomposition of austenite at constant temperature. It was varied time of stay in the isothermal treatment between 15 and 28800 seconds depending on the treatment temperature. After each isothermal treatment and standard metallographic preparation, the samples were etched with color metallography reagents for revealing the microstructure obtained. At temperatures of 700 ºC to 550 °C the steel showed microstructure composed of ferrite and pearlite. Between 500 ºC and 400 °C bainitic microstructure was quickly formed. The reduction of treatment temperature provided finer microstructures, which increased the hardness of steel. With the use of color metallography reagents, excellent contrast for determining the volume fraction of <b>microstructural</b> <b>constituents</b> formed isothermally was obtained, helping the study of isothermal decomposition of austenite...|$|R
