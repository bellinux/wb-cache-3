25|$|In {{the decades}} before 1856, {{want and need}} of a passage over the Ohio River was apparent. Commerce between Ohio and Kentucky could not {{continue}} unless some form of transportation was devised that did not bow {{to the whims of}} <b>mother</b> <b>nature.</b> The distance from shore to shore was great and the steamboat traffic highly congested. The only solution that would not constrict traffic on the river even further was a wire cable suspension bridge of the type developed by French engineers. Several American engineers had begun designing and building suspension bridges. One of these men was John A. Roebling of Saxonburg, Pennsylvania. The Ohio River, however, was much wider than any river that had been bridged in France.|$|E

500|$|Davenport {{often makes}} {{national}} headlines when it suffers seasonal flooding by the Mississippi River.
