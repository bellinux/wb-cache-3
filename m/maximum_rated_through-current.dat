Plots of elongation rates against time, taken from the literature, allowed the characterization of the two responses in monocotyls and dicotyls. Study of published rate-time elongation curves showed that the <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> of the first response is frequently greater than the <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> of the second response; however, the <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> of the second response has not yet been shown to exceed the <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> of the first response...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Scheduling {{algorithms}} in CDMA packet systems need {{to allocate}} codes and power based on channel state information and queue information. For finite queue sizes, the allocated rate {{should be less}} than or equal to the <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> required to clear the whole queue. This ensures that resources are not under-utilized. Although queue size and head-of-the-line packet delays have been considered in existing scheduling methods, this <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> constraint has not been explicitly enforced. In this paper, we propose a new scheduling algorithm incorporating the <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> constraint. The proposed algorithm performs better in terms of delay distribution and percentage of dropped packets compared to existing algorithms that do not directly enforce the <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> constraint.

40|$|Abstract—While exisiting {{weighted}} fair scheduling schemes guarantee minimum bandwidths for classes/sessions in {{a shared}} channel, <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> control, which {{is critical to}} service providers and carriers for resource management and business strategies, was generally enforced by employing policing mechanisms. The previous approaches use either a concatenation of rate controller and scheduler, or a policer in front of scheduler. The concatenation method uses two sets of queues and management aparartus, and thus incurs overhead. The other method allows bursty traffic to pass through that can violate <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> constraint or cause a high packet loss rate. In this paper, we present a new weighted fair scheduling scheme, WF 2 Q-M, to simultaneously support <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> control and minimum service rate guarantee. WF 2 Q-M proposes the virtual clock adjustment method to enforce <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> control by distributing the excess bandwidths of <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> constrained sessions to other sessions without recalculating the virtual starting and finishing times of regular sessionss. In terms of performance metrics, we prove that WF 2 Q-M is theoretically bounded by a fluid reference model. A procedural scheduling implementation of WF 2 Q-M is proposed and proof of correctness is given. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show the performance of WF 2 Q-M is just as we claimed...|$|R

40|$|Measurements {{made from}} carotid pulse tracings and phonocardiograms are helpful in the {{prediction}} of severe aortic stenosis in young patients. In the elderly, however, analysis of the carotid pulse tracing and, in particular, its <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> of rise has proved unreliable because the range of normal values for this age group has not been established. Consequently, we studied 44 young normal and 44 older normal subjects, 15 older patients with systolic hypertension, and 36 older patients with significant aortic stenosis. Measurements obtained from the carotid pulse included the left ventricular ejection time, upstroke time, half-rise time, and the <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> of rise. The peak of the systolic murmur in aortic stenosis was measured phonocardiographically from the Q wave of the simultaneously recorded electrocardiogram (QP interval). The results confirm that the <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> of rise of the carotid pulse of normal older subjects is much more rapid than that of young subjects. Among elderly patients with aortic stenosis, the <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> of rise falls {{within the range of}} the normal young. Measurement of the half-rise time is imprecise, and there is considerable overlap with the normal. This is also true of left ventricular ejection time. The upstroke time is unreliable because of wave distortion produced by the arteriosclerotic vascular bed. The two most valuable and easily recorded measurements are the <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> of rise and the QP interval. A <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> of rise of more than 1000 mmHg/s and a QP interval of less than 220 ms argue strongly against the diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis. These measurements provide a simple, non-invasive means of avoiding left heart catheterisation in older subjects suspected of having severe aortic stenosis...|$|R
