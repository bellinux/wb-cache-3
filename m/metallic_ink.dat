40|$|With {{the advent}} of nano-particles based <b>metallic</b> <b>inks,</b> inkjet {{printing}} emerged as an attractive medium for fast prototyping {{as well as for}} low cost and flexible electronics. However, at present, it is limited to printing of <b>metallic</b> <b>inks</b> on conventional microwave substrates. For fully printed designs, ideally, the substrate must also be printed. In this work, we demonstrate a fully printed process utilizing a custom Fe 2 O 3 based magnetic ink for functional substrate printing and a custom silver-organo-complex (SOC) ink for metal traces printing. Due to the magnetic nature of the ink, this process is highly suitable for tunable microwave components. The printed magnetic substrate is characterized for the magnetostatic as well as microwave properties. The measured B(H) curve shows a saturation magnetization and remanence of 1560 and 350 Gauss respectively. As a proof of concept, a patch antenna is implemented in the proposed stack up which shows a tuning range of 4 % around the center frequency. © 2016 IEEE...|$|R

50|$|The only folio set {{produced}} in Klimt's lifetime, Das Werk Gustav Klimts, was published initially by H. O. Miethke (of Gallerie Miethke, Klimt's exclusive gallery in Vienna) from 1908 to 1914 in an edition of 300, supervised personally by the artist. The first thirty-five editions (I-XXXV) each included an original drawing by Klimt, {{and the next}} thirty-five editions (XXXVI-LXX) each with a facsimile signature on the title page. Fifty images depicting Klimt's most important paintings (1893-1913) were reproduced using collotype lithography and mounted on a heavy, cream-colored wove paper with deckled edges. Thirty-one of the images (ten of which are multicolored) are printed on Chine-collé. The remaining nineteen are high quality halftones prints. Each piece was marked with a unique signet—designed by Klimt—which was impressed into the wove paper in gold <b>metallic</b> <b>ink.</b> The prints were issued in groups of ten to subscribers, in unbound black paper folders embossed with Klimt's name. Because of the delicate nature of collotype lithography, {{as well as the}} necessity for multicolored prints (a feat difficult to reproduce with collotypes), and Klimt's own desire for perfection, the series that was published in mid-1908 was not completed until 1914.|$|E
40|$|Reproducing color {{images with}} {{embedded}} metallic patterns By combining a <b>metallic</b> <b>ink</b> and standard inks, one may create printed images having a dynamic appearance: an image viewed under specular reflection may be considerably {{different from the}} same image viewed under non-specular reflection. Patterns which are either dark or hidden become highlighted under specular reflection, yielding interesting visual effects. To create such images, one {{needs to be able}} to reproduce at non-specular reflection angles the same colors, by standard inks alone or in combination with a <b>metallic</b> <b>ink.</b> Accurate color prediction models need to be established which model the underlying physical phenomena in a consistent manner. To meet this challenge, we propose two models, one for predicting the reflection spectra of standard inks on coated paper and one for predicting the reflection spectra of a combination of standard inks and a <b>metallic</b> <b>ink.</b> They are enhancements of the classical Clapper-Yule model which models optical dot gain of halftone prints by taking into account lateral scattering within the paper bulk and multiple internal reflections. The models we propose also take into account physical dot gain and ink spreading for standard inks as well as the low reflectance of metallic inks at nonspecular reflection angles and the poor adherence of standard inks printed on top of a <b>metallic</b> <b>ink</b> (trapping effect). These models open the way towards color separation of images to be reproduced by combining a <b>metallic</b> <b>ink</b> and standard inks. Several designs printed on an offset press demonstrate their applicability and their benefits for high-end design and security applications...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Most halftoning {{techniques}} allow screen dots to overlap. They rely on {{the assumption}} that the inks are transparent, i. e. the inks do not scatter a significant portion of the light back to the air. However, many special effect <b>inks</b> such as <b>metallic</b> <b>inks,</b> iridescent inks or pigmented inks are not transparent. In order to create halftone images, halftone dots formed by such inks should be juxtaposed, i. e. printed side by side. We propose an efficient juxtaposed color halftoning technique for placing any desired number of colorant layers side by side without overlapping. The method uses a monochrome library of screen elements made of discrete lines having rational thicknesses. Discrete line juxtaposed color halftoning is performed efficiently by multiple accesses to the screen element library. Index Terms—Color halftoning, discrete lines, juxtapose...|$|R

40|$|The Laser Assisted Direct Write (LADW) method {{can be used}} to {{generate}} electrical circuitry on a substrate by depositing <b>metallic</b> <b>ink</b> and curing the ink thermally by a laser. Laser curing has emerged over recent years as a novel yet efficient alternative to oven curing. This method can be used in-situ, over complicated 3 D contours of large parts (eg. aircraft wings) and selectively cure over heat sensitive substrates, with little or no thermal damage. In previous studies, empirical methods have been used {{to generate}} processing windows for this technique, relating to the several interdependent processing parameters on which the curing quality and efficiency strongly depend. Incorrect parameters can result a track that is cured in some areas and uncured in others, or in damaged substrates. This thesis addresses the strong need for a quantitative model which can systematically output the processing conditions for a given combination of ink, substrate and laser source; transforming the LADW technique from a purely empirical approach, to a simple, repeatable, mathematically sound, efficient and predictable process. This thesis describes in detail a novel and generic Finite Element Method (FEM) model {{that for the first time}} predicts the evolution of the thermal profile of the ink track during laser curing and thus generates a parametric map which indicates the most suitable combination of parameters for process optimisation.
