30|$|During {{the present}} study, coal samples were {{collected}} from Derra underground coal mines following the pillar coal sampling method. Coal {{samples were collected}} from Karharbari Top seam and Karharbari Bottom seam. Their megascopic characterization was performed by using the scheme proposed by Diessel (1965) and macroscopic seam profiles were constructed. For the microscopic study coal samples were crushed to 18 mesh size (< 1  mm size particles). The polished particulate coal mounts were prepared by using cold mounting epoxy resin without pressure. The study was carried out on an advanced petrological microscope equipped with MSP 200 photometry system and fluorescence attachment. The maceral nomenclature applied, followed the ICCP system (1971, 1998, 2001). For the <b>microlithotype</b> analysis, a 20 point Kötter graticule was used. The line to line and {{point to point distance}} was maintained 0.4  mm for both maceral and <b>microlithotype</b> analysis. The maceral and <b>microlithotype</b> counting was done simultaneously. The reflectance measurement was carried out as per the ISO standard (ISO 7404 - 5 1994). For the precise assessment of liptinite and dark vitrinite microscopic examination of macerals was carried out both under the white incident light as well as under blue light excitation. The International Committees for coal Petrology (1971) devised certain rules for the characterization of maceral association. According to which, the minimum dimension of a band to be called a <b>microlithotype,</b> should be 50  ×  50  mm, and the 5  % rule. The 5  % rule demonstrates that a <b>microlithotype</b> can have 5  % accessory macerals due to the very fact that neither the monomaceral nor the bimaceral microlithotypes are constituted exclusively of the macerals of one group or two groups respectively. Therefore, they can have 5  % accessory macerals which will have no role in their nomenclature or characterization. ICCP recommendation has been followed during the characterization of <b>microlithotype.</b> All the coal samples were subjected to proximate (BIS 2003) and petrographic analysis.|$|E

30|$|Petrographic {{study of}} the Karharbari coal shows that these coals are {{vitrinite}} rich, followed by liptinite and inertinite. Secondary liptinite macerals are observed in significant amount. The <b>microlithotype</b> analysis shows the dominance of vitrite followed by vitrinertite, clarite and inertite. The vitrinite reflectance (Ro) and volatile matter (d.a.f) values rank the Karharbari coal as high volatile bituminous ‘C’ to ‘B’. The microscopic constituents of Karharbari coal indicate peat accumulation in the forest mire under fluctuating oxic to anoxic conditions with good tissue preservation.|$|E
40|$|Carbonate {{minerals}} commonly {{occur in}} coals of many ages {{and from a}} utilisation viewpoint can be deleterious. Several studies have been undertaken of the carbonates in the Permian coals of the Hunter Valley, Australia, but few studies use a multi-technique approach. For this study, a combined petrographic, geochemical and mineralogical approach {{was used to determine}} the distribution and residence of carbonate minerals in coal that had been intruded by a dyke. The dominant carbonate assemblages comprise primary siderite in inertinite-rich <b>microlithotypes</b> and secondary calcite(–ankerite–dolomite) –dawsonite in vitrinite-rich <b>microlithotypes.</b> The secondary carbonates were found in both the aureole of heated coal and also in an unheated mine-face sample. It is believed that the secondary carbonate minerals precipitated from magma-derived fluids percolating through the coal following the emplacement of the intrusions. The textures and distribution of the secondary carbonate minerals suggest that the temperature and pressure of the fluids may be just as important in developing fractures near dykes (particularly those that have multiple phases of geometries), cleat mineralogy and coal textures as direct heating from the intrusion. The partitioning of primary siderite with inertinite and secondary carbonates with vitrinite indicates that it can be reasonably expected {{that there would be a}} partitioning of minerals in various density fractions derived from float–sink tests and consequently a partitioning of elements with inertinite-rich fractions containing elevated Fe levels and vitrinite-rich fractions containing elevated Ca, Mg and Al. This partitioning has implications for the behaviour of the coal during washing and combustion, and the composition of combustion products...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of unwanted coal fines during the handling and utilisation of coal {{is a serious}} problem in processes that rely on large or closely sized particles. Coal degradation occurs at many different steps within the beneficiation or utilisation processes and through many different mechanisms, none of which are understood thoroughly. In an effort to describe the degradation mechanisms, the changes within a number of coal particles were tracked using micro-focus X-ray computed tomography (?-CT). The observed changes were caused by impact loading, compressive loading and thermal shock. The resolution of the ?-CT tomograms enabled the identification and tracking of changes in the coal microstructure. A comparison of the tomograms taken before, during and after breakage and fracture showed that the microstructure of coal had an influence on the breakage characteristics. For impact- and compressive loading as well as during thermal treatment, the biggest structural contributor was shown to be the network of pre-existing cracks and cleats within a particle. Lower density macerals contributed more to breakage than the higher density macerals and any structure (pre-existing cracks, lithotypes boundaries and mineral boundaries) present within the particles had the potential to either act as a crack initiation site, change the direction of a propagating crack or arrest crack propagation. The direction of the applied loads during compressive- and impact loading was the biggest contributor to the directionality of newly formed cracks. For thermal treatment, the vitrinite rich <b>microlithotypes</b> showed more new crack formation compared to the other <b>microlithotypes</b> present. The particles also showed no evidence of devolatilisation (an increase in the porosity of the particle) but did show evidence of thermal drying (new cracks formed perpendicular to existing cracks) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{correlation}} between local mechanical (elasto-plastic) and structural (composition) properties of coal presents significant fundamental and practical interest for coal processing {{and for the}} development of rheological models of coal to coke transformations. Here, we explore the relationship between the local structural, chemical composition, and mechanical properties of coal using a combination of confocal micro-Raman imaging and band excitation atomic force acoustic microscopy for a bituminous coal. This allows high resolution imaging (10 s of nm) of mechanical properties of the heterogeneous (banded) architecture of coal and correlating them to the optical gap, average crystallite size, the bond-bending disorder of sp 2 aromatic double bonds, and the defect density. This methodology allows the structural and mechanical properties of coal components (lithotypes, <b>microlithotypes,</b> and macerals) to be understood, and related to local chemical structure, potentially allowing for knowledge-based modeling and optimization of coal utilization processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{major oil}} and gas fields in Australia produce from coal measure sediments, in {{contrast}} to the giant oil fields of the Northern Hemisphere which are associated with the marine rocks. The organic matter in the Australian fields is present both as coal seams and fragments of coaly material dispersed through the adjacent sediments. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine whether the organic matter in the coal seams and as dispersed fragments is the same, different or systematically related. The type of organic matter in each may indicate that one is better, or the same, as a source for hydrocarbons. The sedimentary sequences examined are those of the Permian- Triassic Cooper Basin, the Permian Pedirka Basin, the Triassic Simpson Desert Basin, and the Jurassic-Cretaceous Eromanga Basin, all of which are located in central Australia. In addition, the relationship of organic matter type to the depositional environment for the Permian sequence in the Cooper Basin was investigated. AH of the studies were carried out using reflected and transmitted light microscopic techniques for analyses of the organic matter. Relationships have been found between the maceral types of the dispersed organic matter (DOM) and the maceral and microlithotypecompositions of the associated coals. Exinite (sporinite) DOM correlates with vitrinite and sporinite in the associated coals in the Cooper and Eromanga Basins, Exinite (cutinite) DOM correlates negatively with cutinite in the coal in the Simpson Desert Basin, Sporinite DOM correlates with vitrite plus clarite and intermediate, microlithotypes (duroclarite, clarodurite and vitrinertite) in the coals of the Cooper Basin. Vitrinite DOM correlates with vitrinite and the intermediate microlithotypes in associated coal in the Cooper Basin, and with resinite in the coal of the Eromanga Basin, Inertinite DOM, mostly inertodetrinite, correlates with inertodetrinite and durite plus inertite in the associated coals in the Cooper Basin. The <b>microlithotype</b> compositions of coals formed in association with a large lake environment are distinctly different from the <b>microlithotype</b> compositions of coals formed on the lower coastal plain and in areasdominated by coal swamps in the Permian of the Cooper Basin, Channel belt coals are also distinct in type from those of the lower coastal plain, upper coastal plain and areas dominated by coal swamps. Lower coastal plain coals can be differentiated from upper coastal plain coals on the basis of their <b>microlithotype</b> compositions. Those coals with the highest vitrite plus clarite contents have formed in channel belts and associated with large lakes. Coals with the highest durite plus inertite contents have formed in the areas dominated by coal swamps. Given that exinite is the coal maceral richest in hydrogen, and therefore the best material for generating hydrocarbons, the best source rocks in the Permian of the Cooper Basin are those which have formed in the large lake and channel belt environments. If inertinite has the least potential as a source for hydrocarbons, then the sequences in areas dominated by coal swamps have the lowest potential as source rocks for hydrocarbons...|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study an attempt {{has been made to}} carry out the {{detailed}} petrographic characterization of the Karharbari coals of Talcher coalfield and to reconstruct the paleoenvironment conditions of coal formation using macerals and microlithtotypes as a tool. For these purposes a large number of samples were collected following the pillar sampling method and were subjected to detailed petrographic study. The petrographic observation shows that these coals are vitrinite rich followed by the liptinite and inertinite group of macerals. On <b>microlithotype</b> scale, these coals shows the dominance of the vitrite followed by clarite, vitrinertite and inertite. The concentration of liptite, clarodurite, duroclarite and vitrinertoliptite are insignificant. The vitrinite reflectance ranks the Karharbari coal as high volatile bituminous ‘C’ to high volatile ‘B’ bituminous. Coal petrography based depositional models suggest peat accumulation in forested telmatic swamp. Moreover, during the time of their evolution, there were alternate phases of oxic and anoxic moor conditions with good tissue preservation.|$|E
40|$|Two Highveld inertinite-rich lump coals were {{utilized}} as feed coal samples {{in order to}} study their physical, chemical structural and petrographic variations during heat treatment in a packed-bed reactor unit combustor. The two feed lump coals were selected as it is claimed that Coal B converts at a slower rate in a commercial coal conversion process when compared to Coal A. The reason for this requires detailed investigation. Chemical structural variations were determined by proximate and coal char CO 2 reactivity analysis. Physical structural variations were determined by FTIR, BET adsorption methods, XRD and 13 C Solid state NMR analysis. Carbon particle type analysis was conducted to determine the petrographic constituents of the reactor generated samples, their maceral associations (<b>microlithotype),</b> and char morphology. This analysis was undertaken {{with the intention of}} tracking the carbon conversion and char formation and consumption behaviour of the two coal samples within the reactor.

40|$|The Veitsch type {{magnesite}} mineralization {{in association}} with talc from Jhiroli is confined within the stromatolitic dolomite of Deoban Formation. The dolomite represents many <b>microlithotypes</b> and characterized by nodules and bands of chert. Microtextures suggest a tidal flat environment where different phases of replacement of dolomite by magnesite were observed. Grain boundary relations, replacement features and different phases of reactions between magnesite and silica explain development of talc in the system. There is a noteworthy similarity in geochemical signatures of dolomite, magnesite and talc except a few major and minor elements, which suggest an external chemical flux is {{not responsible for the}} magnesite and talc mineralizations. On the basis of field relation, petrography and geochemistry it can be inferred that the marine, sparry magnesite deposits are product of diagenetic replacement of early dolomite in a protected intertidal carbonate flat environment whereas the associated talc deposits resulted from incipient/low grade regional burial metamorphism of these siliceous, magnesium bearing carbonates...|$|R
30|$|Heidaigou coal is a {{low-rank}} {{bituminous coal}} {{with a high}} ash content. The sulfur content is low and dominated by pyritic sulfur. The Al 2 O 3 content is high while SiO 2 is relatively low in the ash. This results a high ash fusion temperature. The mine {{is located at the}} north edge of the carboniferous-permian coal accumulation basin in Northern China. The vitrinite content is lower than the average of the area while the inertinite and liptinite contents are higher (Han 1996). The dominant vitrinite macerals are telocollinite and desmocollinite. A small amount of telinite is also present. The liptinite group is mainly represented by sporinite, which disperses in the desmocollinite and in the matrix of the inertinite in the bedding direction. Fragmental fusinite usually mixes with semifusinite. The main <b>microlithotypes</b> are vitrite, trimacerite and durite while a small amount of clarite, inertrite and vitrinertite are present. Vitrite is usually uniform while trimacerite is fragmental or of lineation shape. Durite is composed of an inertinite matrix and a clastic texture.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{characteristics}} of coals of Basundhara block of Ib-valley. The {{aim of this study}} is to reconstruct the paleo-environment condition of coal formation. A large number of pillar coal samples from Basundhara block were collected and subjected to detailed petrographic and geochemical studies. The results show that the Basundhara block (Rampur seam) coals are rich in inertinite group macerals. The rank of Basundhara block coals as per ASTM system and according to the mean of random vitrinite reflectance has been found to range between sub-bituminous ‘A’ and high volatile bituminous ‘B’. The proximate analyses exhibit that coals belong to semi-coking to weakly coking range. The ultimate composition shows hydrogen ranges between 4. 87 and 6. 20 %, carbon from 78. 7 to 86. 3 % and oxygen between 7. 26 and 13. 78 %. The nitrogen ranges from 0. 71 to 0. 76 % and sulphur is between 0. 53 and 0. 96 %. The quantitative study of macerals, <b>microlithotypes</b> and mineral matter indicate that these coals originated from the plant communities of highly fluctuating oxic and anoxic moor to oxic (dry) moor with sudden high flooding conditions. Low value of Tissue Preservation Index (TPI) and high value of Gelification Index (GI) indicate peat formation in dry condition...|$|R
40|$|The Early Jurassic coal {{samples for}} the study were {{obtained}} from CRA Exploration Pty Ltd. (CRAE), drilled in the Gairdner and Mintaja Blocks, Gairdner Range of the Hill River Area, northern Perth Basin, Western Australia. The area is located approximately 280 km north of Perth. The coal measures subcrop in a half- graben bounded by the Lesueur-Peron Fault in the west, and the Warradarge Fault in the east. The coal occurs within the shallow sequence of the Cattamarra Member which is also described as the Cattamarra Coal Measures of the Cockleshell Gully Formation. Six sub-seams of seam G, namely G 1 to G 6, from the six drill cores, were examined for petrological and geochemical investigation. The coal predominantly comprises of banded, dull banded, and dull lithotypes, with minor bright banded, bright and fusainous types. Based on maceral analyses, the dominant maceral groups are vitrinite and inertinite, whilst the exinite and mineral matter are in minor contents. The vitrinite content has a range between 47. 2 % to 73. 0 %, and it is composed mainly of telocollinite and desmocollinite. The inertinite is dominated by semifusinite, fusinite, and inertodetrinite, {{and it has a}} range from 10. 4 % to 24. 8 %. The exinite group varies between 7. 2 % to 20. 8 % in content, and it is represented by sporinite, cutinite, alginite and resinite. The mineral matter dominated by clays and pyrite, ranges between 4. 5 % to 20. 6 %. The <b>microlithotype</b> analyses shows that the vitrite plus clarite content varies from 47. 0 % to 70. 0 %, intermediates between 8. 0 % to 26. 0 %, whilst inertite plus durite content is relatively low, varying from 6. 55 % to 14. 0 %. The maximum reflectance of vitrinite has a value between 0. 47 % and 0. 53 %, which represents rank at sub-bituminous level based on the Australian rank values and corresponding to the sub-bituminous A and B rank of the ASTM classification and to the metalignitous type of the Pareek classification. On the basis of carbon and hydrogen content, the coal is categorised as per-hydrous meta- to ortho-lignitous type. The trace elements As, B, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ga, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sr, Th, U, V, Y, Zn, and Zr, are spectrographically analysed in the coal ash. The B content in the coal supports the presence of marine influence during peat deposition in the basin.

40|$|Coal is a {{heterogeneous}} substance and its heterogeneity is identified and characterized by variation in reflectance. The main {{objective of this}} paper is to characterize the heterogeneity of char and to correlate it with the coal reflectogram, which accounts for both rank and maceral composition effects. Chars from two density fractions in a set of coals were obtained in a Drop Tube Furnace (DTF) at 1400 degrees C in N- 2 environment. The chars were examined under a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and the morphology information was obtained from the image-processing technique. The average porosity of char changes systematically with the FMR of its parent coals (defined as the summation of each reflectance multiplied with its frequency). The char porosity increased with an increase in FMR up to a critical value around 98. With further increase in FMR, the corresponding char becomes dense. The char macro porosity distribution was found to be related to the coal reflectogram. In general, the char porosity distribution shows two peaks, which corresponds to the inertinite and vitrinite peaks in reflectogram. The intensity depends on the maceral content. The relationship between the char porosity and coal reflectance for this set of sample has been found, which is strongly dependent on the coal rank. However. these findings cannot be applied to coals with a strong maceral association (<b>microlithotype)</b> ...|$|E

Among the vitrinites, collotelinite record the highest followed by vitrodetrinite and collodetrinite. In the studied coals, inertinite {{also has a}} major presence indicating dry episodes {{in the development of}} the peat. Among the microlithotypevitrite followed by inertite, clarite and durite are major entities in the coals. The rank of the coal as per the volatile matter is between sub-bituminous ‘B’ and sub-bituminous ‘A’. Hydrocarbon generation potential is low as indicated by rock–eval pyrolysis. Based on HI and OI plots and elemental H/C and O/C ratio, the investigated coals have been characterized as kerogen Type III, suggestive of dominantly terrestrial and lacustrine organic matter. The peat development on basis of <b>microlithotype</b> composition suggest their evolution in limno-telmatic zones having floral inputs characteristic of forest moor with intermittent hydrological conditions. The Gelification Index and Tissue Preservation Index are suggestive of terrestrial origin with high tree density. Further, moderately high GI and exceedingly high telovitrinite based TPI along with high ash content are indicative of their origin in intermittent dry forested swamps. The Ground Water Index suggests that these coals have evolved in bogs under ombrotrophic hydrological conditions. The Vegetation Index values are indicative of preponderance of herbaceous plants in the formation of the coals. The plots on a depositional model given by Smyth (1979) indicate their deposition under fluvio-lacustrine control with the development of upper deltaic and lower deltaic conditions near the fresh water lacustrines.|$|E
40|$|The {{magnesite}} and talc {{deposits of}} Kumaun Lesser Himalaya are confined within the Precambrian carbonate rocks of Deoban Formation (Valdiya, 1980). A regional picture of mineralization is obtained by selecting three small but crucial deposits viz. Jhiroli, Rema and Kanda {{in the district}} of Bageshwar of northeastern Kumaun. The stromatolitic dolomites that host the Veitsch type magnesite represents many <b>microlithotypes</b> and characterized by nodules and bands of chert. Magnesite is host to the widely distributed, high grade talc deposits. Grain boundary relations, replacement features and different phases of reactions between magnesite and silica explain development of talc in the system. The field and petrographic evidence aided with the fluid phase studies of limestone-dolomite-magnesite-quartz-talc assemblage suggest chronology in terms of successive stages of mineral formation. The three successive stages are characterized by different diagenetic minerals and progressive timing with relation to burial and compaction. The dolomite of the study area characterizes first stage replacement of calcite precursor. A low saline aqueous fluid with composition H 2 O+NaCl+KCl+MgCl 2, and peak of fluid activity at about 220 ºC participated in this replacement. Presence of both Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + ions in the system represent equilibrium between fluids and host mineral. At a successive stage, magnesite was formed replacing early formed dolomite. Such replacement is evident in petrography wherein magnesite replaced dolomite along the cleavage, micro fractures and grain boundaries. It is interpreted that Mg++ rich basinal fluid {{played a key role in}} replacement, as is also supported by fluid composition H 2 O+NaC...|$|R
40|$|The Campanian {{rocks of}} the Mesa Verde Group in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico, USA, form a {{littoral}} wedge composed of offshore, shoreface and onshore facies. This siliciclastic wedge was {{interpreted as a}} landward-to-seaward stepping of grouped genetic units, i. e. intermediate term cycles. The continental facies consist of coastal-plain deposits (coals, shales, and sandstones) represented by three main domains, progressively distant from the palaeoshoreline: the deltaic-plain, the intermediate-plain, and the alluvial-plain domains. In the deltaic-plain, grouped aggradational–retrogradational genetic units consist of preserved coal-shale doublets alternating with thick shales. Although previous works have identified genetic units in the shoreface facies, {{the existence of the}} latter has not been proven in the coastal-plain deposits. As coal-shale doublets may represent such genetic units, an organic petrography study was performed at high resolution on an 80 -cm thick, 1. 5 -km long coal seam to demonstrate this hypothesis. In this work, the depositional environments of the initial peatlands were rebuilt utilizing two complementary methods: maceral and <b>microlithotype</b> analyses. The results reveal the existence of internal sequences in the coal seam, corresponding to recurrent patterns of a palaeogeographical model proposed for a littoral domain. The authors interpret this coal sequence as the record of successive progradational and aggradational events. Furthermore, a previous study of the organic content of the shales located above the coal demonstrated that the preservation of these facies is related to higher accommodation/peat production and accommodation/sedimentary supply ratios. Coal-shale doublets are then interpreted as elemental genetic units of the deltaic-plain formation. This study demonstrates that, contrary to original concepts, littoral coal seams are not just markers of stable shoreline conditions at a high time scale, but also record landscape migration...|$|E

The major coal seams developing in Xishanyao Formation (Middle Jurassic) are the high-quality steam coals characterized by large thickness, favorable horizontal continuity and high coal quality. In this paper, twenty-two samples were collected from the three typical boreholes in Hanshuiquan district, representing the 11 coal seam sequences (7 #, 8 #, 9 #, 13 #, 14 #, 15 #, 17 #, 18 #, 19 #, 20 #, 22 #), respectively. The petrographic characteristics of the coal-bearing sequence in Xishanyao Formation were firstly summarized systematicly, and then the coal-forming swamp characteristics and succession mechanism of the coal seam in Xishanyao Formation were defined by analyzing the samples. The maceral composition, structure, geochemical and geophysical characteristics of coal are included in original genetic criteria of coal-forming swamp analysis. And the composition of coal petrography, maceral and <b>microlithotype</b> are {{the most frequently used}} parameters. Coal is composed of microscopic constituents and inorganic substances. The Xishanyao Formation maceral mainly consists of vitrinite (65.74 %– 97.01 %), inertinite (1.93 %– 34 %), and the exinite shows the mode of regular change. The coal-forming swamp in Xishanyao Formation possesses the characteristics of mainly marsh, wet forest swamp facies, and shallow water covered forest swamp facies, and a few of coal seams distribute in the deep water covered forest swamp facies. In addition, the sporopollens in Xishanyao Formation are mainly Pinaceae evergreen broad leaf and needle-leaved plants, Osmundaceae, Cyatheaceae and Lygodiaceae, indicating that the warm and humid tropic-subtropical climate conductive to the persistent growth of coal-forming plants in the Middle Jurassic. The coal-forming swamp shows the characteristics of vertically upward fluctuation through the periodic transition. It indicates a shallow-deep-shallow change process of the water covered depth in the swamp. This is the principal factor for the formation of the high-quality and continuous coal seam in Hanshuiquan district, Santanghu Coalfield.|$|E

The coal {{measures}} gradationally overlie rapidly shallowing-upward Waitakian to late Altonian sediments of the marine Inangahua Formation, and are unconformably overlain by Opoitian to Waipipian shallow marine to marginal marine sediments of the Giles Formation. Three members are recognised within the coal measures: a) the late Altonian to Clifdenian (?) Thomson Member occurs north of Inangahua Landing, and is interpreted as a marine influenced lower delta plain environment. b) the late Altonian to Waiauan (?) Camp Member occurs north of McMurray Creek, and is interpreted as a humid alluvial fan characterised by gravel-dominated "scott-type" channel sediments, and locally thick sequences of fine grained overbank sediments interbedded with thick conglomeratic crevassesplay deposits. c) the late Altonian to Waiauan (?) Donkey Member occurs in the southern Inangahua Valley, and is interpreted as a parallic alluvial plain characterised by low sinuosity, predominatly sandy rivers, and thick low sulphur coal. <b>Microlithotype</b> and maceral analyses suggest that Rotokohu coals were predominantly formed from "woody" vegetation under telmatic (i. e. periodically inundated) conditions. Five reactives-rich, inerts-poor coal types are recognised, and are related to possible paleoenvironmental settings. Coal type variation in exinite content and vitrinite chemistry appear to be major influences on volatile matter yields and specific energy, while variations in vitrinite chemistry are interpreted as {{a major influence on}} vitrinite reflectance. Vertical and lateral rank variations, weathering, and a possible variable marine influence are also probable influences on the analytical properties of the outcrop coal samples used in this investigation. Syngenetic mineral matter in Rotokohu coals consists predominantly of detrital quartz, kaolinite and locally muscovite, and dominates the ash mineralogy of most samples. organically bound elements, Ca, Mg, Na and Al are a major influence on the ash mineralogy of some low ash samples.

40|$|The Early Permian coal {{samples for}} the study were {{obtained}} from the Vasse Shelf, southern Perth Basin, located approximately 200 km south- west of Perth. The selected coal samples {{for the study}} were also obtained from the Premier Sub-basin of the Collie Basin and the Irwin Sub-basin of the Perth Basin. The Early Permian coal measures are described as the Sue Coal Measures from the Vasse Shelf, the Ewington Coal Measures from the Premier Sub-basin and the coal measures from the Irwin sub-basin are described as the Irwin River Coal Measures. The Vasse Shelf coal is finely banded and the dominant lithotypes are dull and dull banded types, followed by bright banded and banded types, with minor bright types. The variation of dull and bright lithotypes represents fluctuating conditions of water table level during the growth of peat in the swamp. The maceral composition of the coal is predominantly composed of inertinite, followed by vitrinite and minor exinite and mineral matter. The coal is characterized by very low to medium semifusinite ratio and medium to high vitrinite content, supporting the deposition in anaerobic wet conditions with some degree of oxidation. The coal is classified as sub- bituminous to high volatile bituminous of the Australian classification. In terms of <b>microlithotype</b> group, the predominance of inertite over vitrite suggests the coal was formed under drier conditions with high degree of oxidation during its deposition. On the basis of the interpretations of lithotypes, macerals, microlithotypes and trace elements, the depositional environment of the coal is braided and meandering deltaic-river system without any brackish or marine influence. The maceral composition of the Collie coal predominantly consists of inertinite and vitrinite, with low exinite and mineral matter. The very low to low semifusinite ratio and low to medium vitrinite content of ++the coal indicate that the coal was formed under aerobic dry to wet conditions with some degree of oxidation. The coal is categorized as sub-bituminous according to the Australian classification. The domination of inertite and durite over vitrite and clarite contents in the coal reflects the deposition under drier conditions with fluctuations in the water table. On the basis of the interpretations of macerals, microlithotypes and trace elements distribution, the depositional environment of the coal is lacustrine, braided to meandering fluvial system, without the influence of any marine influx. The maceral composition of the Irwin River coal consists predominantly of vitrinite and inertinite, and minor exinite and mineral matter. The coal has very low semifusinite ratio and medium to high vitrinite content, suggesting the coal was deposited in anaerobic wet conditions with some degree of oxidation. The coal is classified as sub-bituminous of the Australian classification. The predominance of vitrite and clarite over inertite and durite contents in the coal indicates that the coal was formed in wetter conditions and in high water covers with a low degree of oxidation. Based on macerals and microlithotypes contents, the depositional environment of the coal is braided fluvial to deltaic, which is in accordance with the interpreted non- marine and mixed marine environment of deposition in the sub-basin. The petrological comparisons of Vasse Shelf, Collie and Irwin River coals show that the average vitrinite content of the Irwin River coal is highest (49. 1 %) and of the Collie coal is lowest (37. 3 %) of the three. The inertinite content is highest in Collie coal (49. 1 %), followed by Vasse Shelf (46. 4 %) and Irwin River (39. 2 %) coals. The exinite content is low in Irwin River coal (6. 3 %) as compared with Vasse Shelf (9. 0 °/,) and Collie (8. 3 %) coals. The mineral matter content ++is relatively low for all the three coals. The rank of the Vasse Shelf coal is high as compared with the Collie and Irwin River coals, either due to tectonic uplift after the deposition in post-Permian in the southern Perth Basin, or due to the average depth of burial over Vasse Shelf which is much greater than that of Collie and Irwin River coals. The comparisons of the coal from Western Australia with the selected Gondwana coals show that the predominance of inertinite over vitrinite occurs in the Western Australian coals (Vasse Shelf and Collie Basin). On the other hand, the Brazilian, eastern Australian, Indian and Western Australian (Irwin Sub-basin) coals are dominated by vitrinite over inertinite. The exinite content is highest in the Indian coals and lowest in the eastern Australian coals. The mineral matter content is highest in the Brazilian and Indian coals, and lowest in Western Australian (Vasse Shelf) and eastern Australian (Sydney Basin) coals. The rank of the coals ranges from sub- bituminous to medium volatile bituminous according to the Australian classification...|$|E
