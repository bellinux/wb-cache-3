MIGA will cover investments such as equity, loans, shareholder loans, and shareholder loan guarantees. The agency may also insure investments such as management contracts, asset securitization, bonds, leasing activities, franchise agreements, and license agreements. The agency generally offers insurance coverage lasting up to 15 {{years with a}} possible five-year extension depending on a given project's nature and circumstances. When an event occurs that is protected by the insurance, MIGA can exercise the investor's rights against the host country through subrogation to recover expenses associated with covering the claim. However, the agency's convention does not require member governments to treat foreign investments in any special way. As a <b>multilateral</b> <b>institution,</b> MIGA is also {{in a position to}} attempt to sort out potential disputes before they ever turn into insurance claims.|$|E

5000|$|Unilateralism {{has had a}} {{long history}} in the United States. In his famous and {{influential}} Farewell Address, George Washington, the first President of the United States, warned that the United States should [...] "steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world". Many years later, this approach was labeled as isolationism, but some historians of American diplomacy have long argued that [...] "isolationism" [...] is a misnomer, and that American foreign policy, beginning with Washington, has traditionally been driven by unilateralism. Recent works that have made this argument include Walter A. McDougall's Promised Land, Crusader State (1997) and John Lewis Gaddis's Surprise, Security, and the American Experience (2004). Advocates of American unilateralism argue that other countries should not have [...] "veto power" [...] over matters of U.S. national security.

30|$|Other {{studies in}} the {{literature}} have incorporated conditional financial support into sovereign default models. For example, Boz (2011) ponders a model {{in which the government}} has access to credit from the private sector and from international financial institutions, which in this paper we refer to as <b>multilateral</b> <b>institution.</b> Each type of creditor offers a different debt contract. He then goes on to analyze how the government allocates its borrowing needs between these two types of creditors, and when it is optimal to default on its debt to the private sector. On their part, Fink and Scholl (2016) propose a model in which the government has access to loans from a <b>multilateral</b> <b>institution.</b> However, this institution imposes fiscal conditions that restrict public expenditure. Since public expenditure and private consumption are substitutes, the government responds by reducing the tax rate. This, in turn, increases private consumption. That is, financial support leads to a private consumption rise. 1 In contrast, in our model, a <b>multilateral</b> <b>institution</b> provides financial aid directly and imposes fiscal conditions that restrict the amount that government can borrow. Hence, in our case, domestic absorption unambiguously falls, in line with the data.|$|E
30|$|Currently {{there are}} no over-arching formal {{agreements}} for water sharing and joint management of the Ganges-Brahamputra Basin. As described previously, there is a patchwork of bilateral agreements {{and a history of}} unilateralism by India and China. Both India and China are now trying to implement continental-scale river diversion schemes that will inevitably bring them into sharp conflict with one another as well as other basin nations in the upper Brahmaputra watershed in particular. There is an urgent need, therefore, to negotiate a multilateral agreement based on sound and consistent international water law and to establish a <b>multilateral</b> <b>institution</b> to oversee the terms of the agreement. A <b>multilateral</b> <b>institution</b> with legal decision-making authority could help restore some balance to the asymmetric power relations in the region (Bandyopadhyay and Ghosh 2009).|$|E

30|$|One of {{our main}} aims {{has been to}} explore the {{implications}} of financial aid. At the heart of its provision, there {{is the lack of}} an effective enforcement mechanism. Thus, a <b>multilateral</b> <b>institution</b> should provide financial aid along with some fiscal discipline, in lieu of an enforcement mechanism, which in the international scenario would be impossible to have. As mentioned, financial aid changes the relative prices that a sovereign faces when confronting the possibility of defaulting. In an ideal world, its provision should avoid a default, have no economic distortions, and contribute toward an economic recovery. However, the model underscores that the presence of financial aid does not assure that the sovereign will avoid a default. Moreover, under some contingencies, it may introduce economic distortions. Prominently, a <b>multilateral</b> <b>institution</b> could have provided financial aid when there was no real need.|$|E
40|$|Multilateral {{funding for}} global {{environmental}} protection, such as biodiversity conservation, requires donor participation. When are donors willing to participate? We examine a game-theoretic model of multilateral funding for environmental projects in developing countries. Donors must first {{decide whether to}} participate in a <b>multilateral</b> <b>institution.</b> They do so in anticipation of a bargaining outcome that depends on their participation decisions. The <b>multilateral</b> <b>institution</b> then bargains with a recipient over the distribution of gains from project implementation. We find that the donors' and the recipient's vulnerability to negative environmental externalities have diverging effects on their participation behavior. As donors' vulnerability to negative externalities increases, their bargaining power decreases and fewer donors participate. But as the recipient's vulnerability increases, more donors participate because their bargaining power grows. These findings can illuminate bargaining over multilateral climate finance and inform the design of international institutions...|$|E
30|$|Overall, {{the model}} {{illustrates}} how {{the introduction of}} financial aid changes the relative prices that the sovereign faces when dealing {{with the possibility of}} defaulting on its debt obligations. Ideally, the presence of financial aid should prevent a default event and minimize economic distortions. However, the model highlights that financial aid does not always ensure that the sovereign will pay its debts. What is more, in some cases, it may introduce economic distortions. In particular, there may be situations in which a <b>multilateral</b> <b>institution</b> grants financial aid to a country that would have repaid its debts in any case. By underscoring the presence of these distortions, the model highlights that a <b>multilateral</b> <b>institution</b> should consider them when designing financial aid programs. How to design the above goes {{beyond the scope of this}} paper. However, we have outlined some ideas that may be useful to address this and other related issues.|$|E

40|$|Within {{economics}} {{there has}} been a mounting interest in institutions. Virtually all the work to date on institutions has examined a single institution. The problem is that in many settings the performance of the institution under examination is affected by other, unexamined institutions. This paper examines the relationship between two types of private-order institutions that facilitated trade in a specific setting—Mexican California during the 1830 s and 1840 s. The surviving evidence suggests that a <b>multilateral</b> <b>institution</b> enabled merchants to extend credit to their retail customers, and a similar <b>multilateral</b> <b>institution</b> enabled the merchants to extend credit to one another. The relationship between these institutions makes them of particular interest. This relationship arose because local communities imposed costs on merchants that affected their trade with one another. The barriers to entry and exit posed by these costs, in turn, facilitated the operation and persistence of the institution that supported intermerchant trade. They also precluded other organizational forms such as the vertical integration of wholesalers...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{builds on}} recent {{empirical}} {{evidence on the}} importance of strategic donor behaviour in aid allocation in order to develop a theoretical model where donor pressure on a recipient for influencing the aid disbursement of a <b>multilateral</b> <b>institution</b> is endogenously determined. Our game-theoretic, multi-agent model with one aid recipient, two bilateral donors and one <b>multilateral</b> <b>institution</b> illustrates the advantage of putting pressure on the recipient as an instrument for foreign policy, as seen from the mighty donor 2 ̆ 019 s point of view. The model shows how this strategic donor behaviour is damaging to the aid-recipient; we also show that other donors not sharing foreign policy goals similar to the strategic, influential donors will, in fact, reduce their aid contributions to the multilateral organizations. This may obviously have profound implications for the volume of total aid flows and may crucially undermine current efforts to substantially increase ODA to meet the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Our paper also contributes to the common debate on foreign aid by presenting a rigorous model that explains the coexistence of both multilateral aid organizations and bilateral aid programmes...|$|E

Relatedly, we explore the extent to which financial support (official aid) by a <b>multilateral</b> <b>institution</b> to Argentina could have had prevented the referred default episode.|$|E
