5|$|The five-year {{survival}} rate for endometrial adenocarcinoma following appropriate treatment is 80%. Most women, over 70%, have FIGO stage I cancer, {{which has the}} best prognosis. Stage III and especially Stage IV cancers has a worse prognosis, but these are relatively rare, occurring in only 13% of cases. The <b>median</b> <b>survival</b> <b>time</b> for stage III-IV endometrial cancer is nine to tenmonths. Older age indicates a worse prognosis. In the United States, white women have a higher {{survival rate}} than black women, who tend to develop more aggressive forms of the disease {{by the time of}} their diagnosis. Tumors with high progesterone receptor expression have a good prognosis compared to tumors with low progesterone receptor expression; 93% of women with high progesterone receptor disease survived to threeyears, compared with 36% of women with low progesterone receptor disease. Heart disease is {{the most common cause of}} death among those who survive endometrial cancer, with other obesity-related health problems also being common.|$|E

25|$|Treatment with {{docetaxel}} increasing {{survival time}} {{in people with}} certain types of cancer. While some clinical trials show median survival times to be increased by approximately only three months, the range of survival time is large. Many people survive beyond five years with treatment from docetaxel, however {{it is difficult to}} attribute these findings directly to treatment with docetaxel. Improved <b>median</b> <b>survival</b> <b>time</b> and response indicates that docetaxel slows metastatic cancer progression and can lead to disease-free survival. Conjunctive treatment of prednisone with docetaxel has been shown to lead to improved survival rate as well as improved quality of life and reduction of pain compared with treatments with mitoxantrone.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The goal of {{this study}} was to provide {{estimates}} of race- and sex-specific survival rates over a 10 -year period for a cohort of 49, 752 Medicare patients admitted to the hospital in 1984 with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. METHODS: Data were derived from Medicare Provider Analysis and Review Record inpatient claims files and the National Death Index file. RESULTS: For a primary diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, <b>median</b> <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> among Black men and women were 2. 5 years and 5. 2 years, respectively; for White men and women, the <b>median</b> <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> were 4. 3 years and 5. 9 years, respectively. <b>Median</b> <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> for Black men and women and White men and women with a secondary diagnosis of pulmonary embolism were 0. 4 years, 0. 7 years, 0. 8 years, and 1. 4 years, respectively. Survival rates declined with advancing age. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, survival rates among Blacks were lower than those among Whites, and men had lower survival rates than women. These survival estimates provide new insights into outcomes following pulmonary embolism in hospitalized elderly people...|$|R

25|$|In {{some parts}} of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, HCC is the most common cancer, {{generally}} affecting men more than women, and with an age of onset between late teens and 30s. This variability is in part due to the different patterns of hepatitis B and hepatitis C transmission in different populations - infection at or around birth predispose to earlier cancers than if people are infected later. The time between hepatitis B infection and development into HCC can be years, even decades, but from diagnosis of HCC to death the average survival period is only 5.9 months according to one Chinese study during the 1970-80s, or 3 months (<b>median</b> <b>survival</b> <b>time)</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa according to Manson's textbook of tropical diseases. HCC is one of the deadliest cancers in China where chronic hepatitis B is found in 90% of cases. In Japan, chronic hepatitis C is associated with 90% of HCC cases. Food infected with Aspergillus flavus (especially peanuts and corns stored during prolonged wet seasons) which produces aflatoxin poses another risk factor for HCC.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{analyze and}} compare the {{clinical}} effects of comprehensive treatment and liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) exceeding Milan criteria. MethodsA retrospective analysis {{was performed on the}} clinical data of 157 patients with HCC (exceeding Milan criteria) who received comprehensive treatment (99 patients, including 48 cases meeting Shanghai criteria) and liver transplantation (58 patients, including 26 cases meeting Shanghai criteria) in our hospital from January 2006 to January 2010. The <b>median</b> <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> and 1 -, 2 -, and 3 -year survival rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was used for survival difference analysis. ResultsFor all patients, the <b>median</b> <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> of the comprehensive treatment group and liver transplantation group were 18  00 ± 1. 15 and 23. 40 ± 4. 44 months, respectively, and their 3 -year survival rates were(18. 2 ± 3. 9) % and (39  7 ± 6. 4) %, respectively; the survival was significantly improved by the treatment of liver transplantation (P= 0. 009). For patients meeting Shanghai criteria, the <b>median</b> <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> of the comprehensive treatment group and liver transplantation group were 20. 00 ± 1. 17 and 36  00 ± 0. 00 months, respectively, and their 3 -year survival rates were (25. 0 ± 6. 3) % and (57. 7 ± 9. 7) %, respectively; there was significant survival {{difference between the two groups}} (P= 0. 008). For patients exceeding Shanghai criteria, the <b>median</b> <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> of the comprehensive treatment group and liver transplantation group were 16. 00 ± 1. 78 and 16. 00 ± 1. 69 months, respectively, and their 3 -year survival rates were (11. 8 ± 4. 5) % and (25. 0 ± 7. 7) %, respectively; there was no significant survival difference between the two groups (P= 0. 221). ConclusionCompared with comprehensive treatment, liver transplantation leads to a significant higher long-term survival rate in HCC patients exceeding Milan criteria but meeting Shanghai criteria. However, the two therapies cause no significant survival difference in HCC patients exceeding Shanghai criteria...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Although some {{nonparametric methods}} have been {{proposed}} in the literature to test for the equality of <b>median</b> <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> for censored data in medical research, in general they have inflated type I error rates, which make their use limited in practice, especially when the sample sizes are small. Methods In this paper, we propose a new nonparametric test with a simple test statistic to compare <b>median</b> <b>survival</b> <b>times.</b> Results The results from our comprehensive simulation study show the new test controls type I error rate very well under all situations considered, even for small sample sizes. In addition, it has comparable detecting power compared to existing methods. Another advantage of the proposed test is its relatively simple formula that requires less computation. Conclusions We propose a new statistical method for comparing survival curves based on their medians. The new method can be easily implemented and applied to censored event time data...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The {{hazard ratio}} (HR) {{is the most}} {{appropriate}} measure for time to event outcomes such as survival. In systematic reviews, HRs can be calculated either from the raw trial data obtained {{as part of an}} individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis or from the appropriate trial-level summary statistics. However, the information required for the latter are seldom reported in sufficient detail to allow reviewers to calculate HRs. In contrast, the <b>median</b> <b>survival</b> and survival rates at specific time points are frequently presented. We aimed to evaluate retrospectively the performance of meta-analyses using <b>median</b> <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> and <b>survival</b> rates by comparing them with meta-analyses using IPD to calculate HRs. METHODS: IPD from thirteen published meta-analyses (MAs) in cancers with high mortality rates were used. <b>Median</b> <b>survival</b> and survival rates were calculated from the IPD rather than taken from publications so that the same trials, patients, and extended follow-up are used in each analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We show that using <b>median</b> <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> or <b>survival</b> rates at a particular point in time are not reasonable surrogate measures for meta-analyses of survival outcomes and that, wherever possible, HRs should be calculated. Individual trial publications reporting on time to event outcomes, therefore, should provide more detailed statistical information, preferably logHRs and their variances, or their estimators...|$|R

40|$|Purpose In two {{previous}} randomized trials, the adjustment of chemotherapy delivery to circadian rhythms improved tolerability and anticancer activity compared with constant-rate infusion during 5 days {{in patients with}} metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients and Methods For this multicenter randomized trial, {{it was hypothesized that}} a chronomodulated infusion of fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin for 4 days (chronoFLO 4) would improve survival by 10 % compared with conventional 2 -day delivery of the same drugs (FOLFOX 2). Patients were treated every 2 weeks with intrapatient dose escalation. Results Baseline characteristics were similar in both arms for the 564 patients (36 institutions, 10 countries). <b>Median</b> <b>survival</b> was 19. 6 months (95 % confidence limit [CL] 18. 2, 21. 2) with chronoFLO 4 and 18. 7 months with FOLFOX 2 (95 % CL = 17. 7, 21. 0; P =. 55). The main dose-limiting toxicities were diarrhea for chronoFLO 4 and neutropenia for FOLFOX 2. The analysis of survival predictors showed that sex was the single most important factor (P =. 001). In women, the risk of an earlier death with chronoFLO 4 was increased by 38 % compared with FOLFOX 2, with <b>median</b> <b>survival</b> <b>times</b> of 16. 3 and 19. 1 months (P =. 03), respectively.
