5000|$|Macrotic ear, a {{prominent}} external ear that features an oversized pinna, but is otherwise morphologically normal. (see <b>Macrotia)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Macrotia</b> {{refers to}} an ear which is larger than would be expected. The normal {{auricular}} axis length is 58-62 mm among females and 62-66 mm among males.|$|E
5000|$|Ear reduction, {{addressing}} <b>Macrotia,</b> {{might involve}} reducing {{one or more}} of the components of oversized ears; the incisions usually are hidden in, or near, the front folds of the pinna.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Macrotia</b> — Ears {{that are}} proportionately {{oversized}} to the person’s head; the surgeon reduces them by making an incision on the lateral {{surface of the}} pinna, just inside the helical rim. The scapha (elongated hollow) is reduced, and {{a segment of the}} helical rim is excised, and the incision is closed primarily to avoid redundancy.|$|E
50|$|Ear Surgery is {{performed}} {{in order to}} improve the look of the ear. Common reasons one feels they require the surgery can be due to dis-figuration caused by injury, birth defects, irregular shape, prominent position of the ear, irregular size being either too small or too large (oversized ears is a condition known as <b>macrotia)</b> in proportion with the head.|$|E
50|$|Timing otoplastic correctionThe ear {{deformity}} to {{be corrected}} determines the advantageous timing of an otoplasty, for example, in children with extremely prominent ears, 4-years old is a reasonable age. In cases of <b>Macrotia</b> associated with prominent ears, the child’s age might be 2-years, nonetheless, it is advantageous to restrict the further growth of the deformed ear. Moreover, regardless of the patient’s age, the otoplasty procedure requires that the patient be under general anaesthesia.|$|E
40|$|Four {{cases of}} ear {{reduction}} for congenital <b>macrotia</b> and ear asymmetry are presented. To minimize the visible scarring {{the technique of}} helical advancement was used. The indications for this uncommon procedure are discussed with {{a review of the}} literature. This simple technique has been effective in achieving the desired reduction, leaving the scar hidden in the eaves of the helix, and we endorse its wider use...|$|E
40|$|The {{index patient}} {{of this report}} is a 17 -week-gestation female fetus with {{bilateral}} anophthalmia, bilateral cleft lip/cleft palate, <b>macrotia</b> with bilateral lateral facial cleft, large open sacral neural tube defect, and uterus unicornis. Parents were normal and nonconsanguineous with an unremarkable family history. Their first child, a 4 -year-old boy, is normal. The second child, a 2 1 / 2 -year-old boy, has bilateral anophthalmia and an abnormal left ear with absent lobule as the sole additional anomaly. These 2 sibs {{seem to be the}} first examples of a new "anophthalmia-plus" syndrome apparently inherited as autosomal-recessive. status: publishe...|$|E
