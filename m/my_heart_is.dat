As {{an extension of}} her abolitionist ideals, she wrote to her brother Charles Beecher, however, about her potential role in the endeavor: My plan...is not in any sense a mere worldly enterprise. I have for many years had a longing to be more immediately doing Christ's work on earth. <b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> with that poor people whose cause in words I have tried to plead, and who now, ignorant and docile, are just in that formative state in which whoever seizes has them.|$|E

25|$|Soon after Purcell's marriage, in 1682, on {{the death}} of Edward Lowe, he was {{appointed}} organist of the Chapel Royal, an office which he was able to hold simultaneously with his position at Westminster Abbey. His eldest son was born in this same year, but he was short-lived. His first printed composition, Twelve Sonatas, was published in 1683. For some years after this, he was busy in the production of sacred music, odes addressed to the king and royal family, and other similar works. In 1685, he wrote two of his finest anthems, I was glad and <b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> inditing, for the coronation of King James II. In 1690 he composed a setting of the birthday ode for Queen Mary, Arise, my muse and four years later wrote one of his most elaborate, important and magnificent works – a setting for another birthday ode for the Queen, written by Nahum Tate, entitled Come Ye Sons of Art.|$|E

500|$|Billboard {{reviewed}} the song favorably, writing {{that it is}} [...] "a wonderfully refreshing release that smartly side-steps her tried-and-true balladry {{in favor of a}} credible foray into jeep-funk territory."

500|$|... "Moments" [...] is a mid-tempo pop ballad. Written {{in the key}} of D major, {{the beat}} is set in common time and moves at a {{moderate}} 150 beats per minute. One Direction's vocal range in the song span from the note of D4 to A5. [...] "Moments" [...] utilises a gently strummed guitar and intermediate piano lines. Inspired by the breakdown of a relationship between Sheeran and an unnamed woman, the song's lyrics revolve around an unrequited love. The chorus of the song is essentially built on the hook, [...] "You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be/ My love, <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> breathing for this moment in time/I'll find the words to say/ Before you leave me today." ...|$|E

In the continuation they also deviate only on one word, [...] "" [...] (lamented) in the alto, [...] "" [...] (hoped) in the tenor. The flowing 12/8 time signature of the duet and a virtuoso solo violin are reminiscent of the original purpose of the music in the congratulatory cantata.

500|$|It is an uptempo and {{predominantly}} club-oriented {{number that}} {{is inspired by}} 1980s music. The song is set in common time and has a driving dance tempo of 136 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A minor and Cyrus' vocals span two octaves, from G3 to C5. It follows the chord progression Am–F–Dm–E. [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] is heavy in rubbery and bubbling disco synths. Keyboard riffs also drive the song's instrumentation. Lyrically, [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] speaks of the thrill of meeting a potential love interest on the dance floor. Verses and the bridge describe the setting using comparisons to numerous things, including tsunamis and rodeos. The song's refrains proceed to question, [...] "Who owns <b>my</b> <b>heart?</b> <b>Is</b> it love or is it art?" ...|$|E

[...] Having suffered through racial prejudice in her teenage years and early film career, when she was stereotyped as a 'white-girl' in India, Koechlin advocates for an anti-racist ideology. She acknowledged her share of confusion, regarding her identity as a [...] "white-skinned woman growing up in Tamil Nadu", who had to defend her [...] "Indian-ness" [...] at numerous occasions. Later in 2012, she said of herself, “My skin is white, but <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> brown.” ...|$|E
500|$|Gens' {{wife and}} {{daughter}} at first went to Kaunas but, after {{the formation of the}} ghetto, they returned to Vilnius and lived near the ghetto's perimeter. His wife used her maiden name rather than Gens'. According to Leonard Tushnet, there were unfounded rumors that the couple had divorced. Gens did not refute the rumors, as he thought they would help protect his family. Other sources state that the two were divorced to protect Elvyra and Ada. Elvyra Gens was opposed to her husband taking {{a leading role in the}} government of the ghetto and urged him to [...] "pass" [...] as a Lithuanian. It is not clear exactly why Gens went into the ghetto, but in a letter to his wife, Gens said [...] "This is the first time in my life that I have to engage in such duties. <b>My</b> <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> broken.
