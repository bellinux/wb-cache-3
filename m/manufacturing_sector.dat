40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the innovative activity of three major Latin American countries – Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico – based on the level of technological intensity of their <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sectors.</b> In addition to substantial differences with regard to the technological effort put in by the manufacturing firms of these countries, we also found out that the distinction between innovative activity in the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sectors</b> of low or medium-low and medium-high or high technological intensity depends on the maturity of the manufacturing framework of these countries. It was observed that the importance in sorting out <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sectors</b> according to their technological intensity varies, both in terms of the probability of bringing innovation into the market and of establishing technological strategies for the various <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sectors.</b> Our study also underscores the importance of interaction of other firm characteristics with the classification of the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sectors</b> for the determination of such strategies...|$|R

5|$|In the 1970s, Korea saw {{substantial}} industrial development, {{much of it}} {{centered in}} the Yeongnam region of which Gyeongju is a part. The POSCO steel mill in neighboring Pohang commenced operations in 1973, and the chemical manufacturing complex in Ulsan emerged in the same year. These developments helped to support the emergence of Gyeongju's <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sector.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Economic Development Board {{had been}} set up in 1961 to {{formulate}} and implement national economic strategies, focusing on promoting Singapore's <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sector.</b> Industrial estates were set up, especially in Jurong, and foreign investment was attracted to the country with tax incentives. The industrialization transformed the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sector</b> to one that produced higher value-added goods and achieved greater revenue. The service industry also grew at this time, driven by demand for services by ships calling at the port and increasing commerce. This progress helped to alleviate the unemployment crisis. Singapore also attracted big oil companies like Shell and Esso to establish oil refineries in Singapore which, by the mid-1970s, became the third largest oil-refining centre in the world. The government invested heavily in an education system that adopted English as the language of instruction and emphasised practical training to develop a competent workforce well suited for the industry.|$|E

The war greatly increased the size and importance of the Australian <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sector</b> and stimulated the development of more technologically advanced industries.

Many women were forced out of traditionally male-dominated industries after the war, however.|$|E

40|$|A Malmquist-Luenberger {{productivity}} index is employed {{to account for}} both marketed output and the output of pollution abatement activities of U.

By accounting for the change in emissions, average annual productivity growth is 3. 6 percent, whereas it is 1. 7 percent when emissions are ignored. We also find adjusted productivity growth improved after 1977, and "Frost Belt" states with rapidly growing <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sectors</b> have significantly higher rates of productivity growth than "Sun Belt" states with slow growing <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sectors.</b> Copyright 2001 Blackwell Publishers...|$|R

A general decline in manufacturing soon followed as industry was being restructured nationwide. By the year 2000, manufacturing was only 16 percent of the local economy.

Economic reforms introduced after 1991 brought foreign competition, led to privatisation of certain public sector industries, opened up sectors hitherto reserved for the public sector and led to an expansion in the production of fast-moving consumer goods. In recent years, Indian cities have continued to liberalise, but excessive and burdensome business regulations remain a problem in some cities, like Kochi and Kolkata.|$|E

30|$|Except {{for these}} drastic changes in sector ranking, the {{fundamental}} {{structure of the}} Japanese economy was fairly stable during 1995 – 2005, as shown in Fig. 2. Personal service sectors (e.g., medical service and health care, accommodations, and restaurants) and final products <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sectors</b> (e.g., machinery, and electric and electrical equipment) are located at the top positions.

5|$|According to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers report, India's GDP at {{purchasing}} power parity could overtake {{that of the}} United States by 2045. During the next four decades, Indian GDP {{is expected to grow}} at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy until 2050. The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sector</b> because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle class. The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.|$|E
5|$|Bayern is one {{of three}} {{professional}} football clubs in Munich. Bayern's main local rival is 1860 Munich, who were the more successful club in the 1960s, winning a cup and a championship. In the 1970s and 1980s, 1860 Munich moved between the first and the third division but lately, have settled in the second division. The Munich derby is still a much-anticipated event, getting a lot of extra attention from supporters of both clubs. 1860 Munich is considered more working-class, and therefore suffers from a diminishing fan base in a city where the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sector</b> is declining. Bayern is considered the establishment club, which is reflected by many board members being business leaders and including the former Bavarian minister president, Edmund Stoiber. Despite the rivalry, Bayern has repeatedly supported 1860 in times of financial disarray.|$|E

Moreover, there are indications of underinvestment of human capital in some <b>manufacturing</b> <b>sectors.</b> These sectors could improve their competitive position by raising the employment shares of intermediate and highly-skilled labour.
