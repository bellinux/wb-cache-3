5|$|It then {{occurred}} to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in the case of animals also; and as animals usually breed much more quickly than does mankind, the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each species, since evidently they do not increase regularly from year to year, as otherwise the world would long ago have been crowded with those that breed most quickly. Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, it {{occurred to}} me to ask the question, why do some die and some live? And the answer was clearly, on the whole the best fitted live... and considering the amount of individual variation that <b>my</b> <b>experience</b> as a collector had shown me to exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be brought about... In this way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required, and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained.|$|E

In sections marked “Then, ” I integrate my own memories of my employment at AAA. In sections titled “Now, ” I analyze <b>my</b> <b>experiences</b> through three interpre-tive lenses: first workplace bullying, then cultural enactments of gender discrimination, and finally white privilege theory to reinterpret the organi-zational dynamics that took place at AAA. In a section called “Next Time, ” I present descriptions of what I would do differently given what I know now {{in the form of}} two letters. Throughout, I engage in self-investigation and self-implication. In short, through weaving together the past, present, and future of <b>my</b> <b>experiences,</b> sense-making, and theoretical prose, I examine the intersections of race, class, and gender in workplace bullying behaviors, to make sense of <b>my</b> <b>experiences</b> and to help others. at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on March 4, 2016 jce. sagepub. comDownloaded fro...|$|R

I shared several narratives to represent common themes of <b>my</b> leadership <b>experience</b> that have caused frustration, encouragement, and a range of other emotions. Through examination of research relevant to <b>my</b> <b>experiences,</b> I have more comprehensively reflected upon my leadership role throughout my college career by comparing and contrasting it to published literature. The research included in this reflection incorporates topics related to <b>my</b> leadership <b>experience</b> including the role of failure, mental health, perspectives and paradigms on leadership, expectations surrounding activism, beliefs promoting student involvement, and the influence of personality traits on leadership. The prevailing question of this discourse and my own thoughts is, "has this been worth it?" Through recounting aspects of being a leader and comparing this to research, I have a heightened understanding of <b>my</b> own leadership <b>experiences.</b> Evaluating <b>my</b> <b>experiences</b> through the lens of research has allowed me to recognize the value and effectiveness of my leadership efforts.
