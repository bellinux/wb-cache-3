40|$|Three {{major groups}} call on demographers to produce medium- and {{long-term}} population forecasts at the national, regional, or global levels - or produce them themselves. They are: other scientists, government and international agencies, {{and the general}} public, including private industry. What these consumers of forecasts demand of demographers, or what demographers {{think that they should}} demand, has been changing. The types of forecasts demanded are changing, the relevant dimension of forecasts is expanding, and users are increasingly requiring that forecasts include an indication of the degree of uncertainty of the forecast. Because the demands placed on demographers for population forecasts have been changing, it is an appropriate time to rethink some of their basic aspects. In this volume we address what we see as key issues in population forecasting: in what dimensions and at what levels of disaggregation should forecasts be provided? (And, in particular, are the traditional dimensions of age and sex sufficient?) Should population forecasts take note of limits to population or interactions between population and other variables? And how should uncertainty be treated? We believe that, at least in part, these issues are driven by changes in what users of forecasts want from population forecasters. The reader will note that we have used the term "forecasts" rather than the more common "projections. " Demographers claim to produce population "projections," which are correctly computed numerical outcomes of a specified algorithm whose form, initial values, and controlling parameters or transition values are specified by the analyst. By definition, a projection must be correct unless arithmetical or other errors are made. However, users of population projections require population "forecasts. " Forecasts are what Donald Pittenger (1980) called a "population projection selected as a likely outcome. " Thus although a demographer makes a "projection," the user employs it as a "forecast. " Some demographers cling to the distinction and wash their hands of what users do with their "projections" or how they interpret them. But we think that this distinction between "projections" and "forecasts"is false because demographers present only one or a limited number of the many possible projections. On what basis do they choose the projection or set of projections? Surely, on the basis that they judge the projection (or central projection of a set of projections) to be the most likely to occur. This point was made almost 50 years ago by Harold Dorn: {{it is difficult to see}} why a demographer would present anything other than the most likely outcome as the preferred <b>middle</b> <b>projection</b> (Dorn 1950). Similarly, although users are told that high and low population forecast variants are not confidence intervals, they are often taken to be so by users. And why should they not? Why else would a high and low variant be reported unless the demographer thought that they indicated the highest numbers and lowest numbers that were possible, although not highly probable? For these reasons, we favor the term "forecast" over the term "projection" where there is any, even implicit, predictive intent...|$|E
40|$|Weather is {{identified}} as one of many factors that influence the demand for cycling. Weather patterns will change due to expected climate change. The aim {{of this article is}} to study the extent to which climate change influences the cycling frequency. The analysis in this article is conducted using an econometric model based on data spanning over four years on weather indicators and the cycling frequency in the Norwegian city of Bodø, which is located north of the Arctic Circle. According to the projections for climate change, both temperature and quantity of precipitation are expected to increase in this area during the next century. An important consequence of changes in the climate in the studied region is the reduced duration of what can be characterised as the winter season. However, this consequence is highly uncertain. When using Norway’s <b>middle</b> <b>projections</b> for climate change by 2050, the analysis shows a moderate increase in cycling frequency of 6. 2 %. For the reduced winter period, the cycle rate might be two and three times higher in 2050 compared to the current level.

40|$|We review several {{methods of}} {{generating}} holograms of 3 D realistic objects illuminated by incoherent white light. Using these methods, {{it is possible}} to obtain holograms with a simple digital camera, operating in regular light conditions. Thus, most disadvantages characterizing conventional holography, namely the need for a powerful, highly coherent laser and meticulous stability of the optical system are avoided. These holograms can be reconstructed optically by illuminating them with a coherent plane wave, or alternatively by using a digital reconstruction technique. In order to generate the proposed hologram, the 3 D scene is captured from multiple points of view by a simple digital camera. Then, the acquired projections are digitally processed to yield the final hologram of the 3 D scene. Based on this principle, we can generate Fourier, Fresnel, image or other types of holograms. To obtain certain advantages over the regular holograms, we also propose new digital holograms, such as modified Fresnel holograms and protected correlation holograms. Instead of shifting the camera mechanically to acquire a different projection of the 3 D scene each time, {{it is possible to}} use a microlens array for acquiring the entire projections in a single camera shot. Alternatively, only the extreme projections can be acquired experimentally, while the <b>middle</b> <b>projections</b> are predicted digitally by using the view synthesis algorithm. The prospective goal of these methods is to facilitate the design of a simple, portable digital holographic camera which can be useful for a variety of practical applications.

40|$|International audiencePatient {{breathing}} during cone-beam acquisition causes artifacts {{which can}} be reduced by {{taking into account the}} motion during the reconstruction of computed tomography (CT) images. Two main classes of methods are available. Gated or respiratory-correlated methods select a subset of the projections according to the respiratory signal. The selected projections are then used for image reconstruction. The dynamic reconstruction method compensates for the respiratory motion by using a 4 D motion model which integrates all the projections. In this study, we compared the two methods with conventional analytic reconstruction using a phantom mounted on a mobile platform that translated sinusoidally in the cranio-caudal direction. The phantom was a wooden mass with a polyethylene cube in its <b>middle.</b> <b>Projections</b> were acquired with an Elekta Synergy system with the platform either fixed or mobile. We performed static reconstruction in both situations, and gated and dynamic reconstructions in the mobile situation only. The reference was static reconstruction with the fixed platform. Three criteria were used to quantitatively compare the reconstructions: blur criterion, signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio. Results showed that the blur was highly reduced with gated and dynamic reconstructions. However, artifacts such as streaks and bands remained clearly visible in the gated CT image because only a subset of the set of cone-beam projections was used for reconstruction. Dynamic reconstruction significantly reduced these artifacts and yielded a quality close to the reference. This work demonstrates the potential of dynamic reconstruction to provide higher quality CT images than gated reconstruction when the 4 D motion during the acquisition phase is known...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} <b>middle</b> duration <b>projections</b> of Croatia’s population, {{until the}} year 2031, determined via the cohort-component method. It outlines eight variants derived from supposed hypotheses in regard to changing birth, migration and death rates. Differences in the variants are exclusively differences in birth and migration rates, since the assumptions {{in regard to the}} death rates are the same in all the variants. The corrected estimate of the population on January 1 st 2001, {{according to the most recent}} census, served as the base population. The results of the projections indicate that in the next thirty years the overall and the natural population reduction of Croatia will continue, and at the end of the period (2031) the population will be demographically older than at the start (2001). The variants differ only in relation to the intensity (i. e. swiftness) of the aging process, yet the direction remains the same. Thus, in the variant that assumes a positive migration balance, the process of aging would be somewhat slower. The only variant that assumes a constant proportion of young people (on the 2001 level), gradual demographic growth and at the end of the period a larger population than in 2001, is the variant based on a high birth rate and positive migration. The impact of migration is very important for future demographic processes. Namely, in the short run, migration cannot change the direction of demographic processes, but it can lessen already existing negative trends...|$|R

Libraries have given attention to human resource management of library professionals. The development of human resources needed for future planning requires a clear understanding of the levels of library personnel currently working and the need for the future strategies. This study aims to examine the current status of individuals working in the information centers in Palestine and establish staff profiles and assist in human resource staffing requirements. The study further aims to make short, medium and long-term recommendations for the development of library and information human resource centers. This study used a multiple-case design approach, involving mixed methods i. e. qualitative and quantitative approaches. The entire 380 library personnel in the library and information centers were involved in the questionnaire survey. In addition, interviews with 60 key officials were done in two phases.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether elimination of tuberculosis in the Dutch population {{can be achieved}} by the year 2030, taking into account the impact of immigration. METHODS: The incidence of tuberculosis (all forms) in the period 1970 to 2030 was estimated using a life-table model for the Dutch population without the impact of immigration. The influence of immigration on tuberculosis incidence among the Dutch was modelled using four immigrant scenarios, distinguished by the assumed contact rate between immigrants and the Dutch population, and by different <b>projections</b> (<b>middle,</b> upper) of the future size of the immigrant population in The Netherlands. RESULTS: The incidence of smear-positive tuberculosis among the Dutch is projected to be 1. 4 per million in the scenario without the influence of immigrant cases, and ranging from 3. 8 to 11. 8 per million in the four immigrant scenarios. In all immigrant scenarios, the prevalence of tuberculosis infection will continue to decline and be less than 1 % by the year 2030. At least 60 % of Dutch tuberculosis cases in the year 2030 are expected {{to be the result of}} transmission from a foreign source case. CONCLUSION: Using a prevalence of tuberculosis infection of less than 1 % as the elimination criterion, tuberculosis will probably be eliminated from the indigenous Dutch population by 2030. However, the incidence of smear-positive tuberculosis is expected to remain higher than 1 per million, and the majority of new tuberculosis cases among the Dutch may be attributable to recent infection from a foreign source cas...|$|R
40|$|Ixodes ricinus is {{a species}} of hard tick that transmits several {{important}} diseases in Europe and North Africa, including Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis. Climate change is affecting the geographic distributions and abundances of arthropod vectors, which in turn influence the geographic distribution and epidemiology of associated vector-borne diseases. To date, few studies have investigated {{effects of climate change}} on the spatial distribution of I. ricinus at continental extents. Here, we assessed the potential distribution of I. ricinus under current and future climate conditions to understand how climate change will influence the geographic distribution of this important tick vector in coming decades. We used ecological niche modeling to estimate the geographic distribution of I. ricinus with respect to current climate, and then assessed its future potential distribution under different climate change scenarios. This approach integrates occurrence records of I. ricinus with six relevant environmental variables over a continental extent that includes Europe, North Africa, and the <b>Middle</b> East. Future <b>projections</b> were based on climate data from 17 general circulation models (GCMs) under 2 representative concentration pathway emissions scenarios (RCPs), for the years 2050 and 2070. The present and future potential distributions of I. ricinus showed broad overlap across most of western and central Europe, and in more narrow zones in eastern and northern Europe, and North Africa. Potential expansions were observed in northern and eastern Europe. These results indicate that I. ricinus populations could emerge in areas in which they are currently lacking, posing increased risks to human health in those areas.

40|$|Thesis (M. F. A.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2007. "Invisible Wall", an installation. {{digitally}} {{captured and}} projected a live scenario {{of what would}} normally be blocked from view. A wall no longer obstructs view but becomes an illusory digital window {{through the use of}} digital technology. The visual environment {{on either side of the}} wall is accessible and understandable. This information consisted of video containing images about the duality of man and nature, as well as any live scenario created by viewers during their presence in the installation. These videos cinematically created another Illusion about the coexistence between man and nature in harmony when in fact recent society's lifestyle contradicts this. The metaphysical illusion questions the nature of reality versus our perceived reality. Three 8 ft wide walls created a rectangular shape installation. They were placed consecutively in a row In the gallery (see diagram 1). The <b>middle</b> wall had <b>projections</b> on both sides of the wall. The two outside walls only had projections on the side facing the middle wall (see diagrams 2 & 3). Cameras inside the center wall were connected to projectors which projected live video in on the Installation (see diagrams 2 & 3). The projections on the two outside walls contained video imagery of contemporary human society on one wall. and a macroscopic view of undisturbed nature on the other. Clips for the nature sequence came from the film Microcosmos: Le peuple de I'herbe (motion picture, 1996; Christophe Barratier, Yvette Mallet, Jacques Perrin, Producers; Claude Nuridsany, Marie Perennou, Directors; France: Pais de Origem). This French-made film documents insects in their daily lives. Directors Christophe Barratier and Yvette Mallet, capture imagery in a way that allows humans to relate to insects in their busy lives. The macro lens and camera speed capture stunning images that allow a microscopic world to appear monumental, or more human scale. The images of humanity and technology were clips taken from the film Koyaanisqatsi Life out of Balance (motion picture, 1983; Francis Ford Coppola, Producer; Godfrey Reggio, Director; Santa Monica: MGM). In this movie, director Godfrey Reggio used clever cinematography and time-lapse to create stunning imagery of mankind's modem lifestyles. These images present society's requirements for sustainability and technological growth.
