5|$|After {{a year of}} courtship, Wallace became {{engaged in}} 1864 to a young woman whom, in his autobiography, he would only {{identify}} as Miss L. Miss L. {{was the daughter of}} Lewis Leslie who played chess with Wallace. However, to Wallace's great dismay, she broke off the engagement. In 1866, Wallace married Annie <b>Mitten.</b> Wallace had been introduced to <b>Mitten</b> through the botanist Richard Spruce, who had befriended Wallace in Brazil and who was also a good friend of Annie Mitten's father, William <b>Mitten,</b> an expert on mosses. In 1872, Wallace built the Dell, a house of concrete, on land he leased in Grays in Essex, where he lived until 1876. The Wallaces had three children: Herbert (1867–1874), Violet (1869–1945), and William (1871–1951).|$|E
5|$|Karl Marginson was {{appointed}} as the club's manager on 22 June, {{and the club}} held trials for players four days later. Around 900 players applied {{to take part in}} the trials, of whom 200 were chosen to take part and 17 selected to play for F.C. United. Jonathan <b>Mitten,</b> great-nephew of Manchester United forward Charlie <b>Mitten,</b> was the club's first signing.|$|E
5|$|This was Arsenal's eighth Charity Shield appearance; {{prior to}} the game they had won five Shields (1930, 1931, 1933, 1934, 1938), and lost two (1935, 1936). By {{contrast}} Manchester United were undefeated in the Charity Shield; the club won their previous two appearances, in 1908 and 1911. Manchester United had beaten Arsenal 1–0 {{the last time the}} two clubs met at Highbury, for a league fixture on 30 August 1948; Charlie <b>Mitten</b> scored the only goal of the match.|$|E
25|$|Idiot <b>mittens</b> are two <b>mittens</b> {{connected}} by a length of yarn, string or lace, threaded through the sleeves of a coat. This arrangement is typically provided for small children to prevent the <b>mittens</b> becoming discarded and lost; when removed, the <b>mittens</b> simply dangle from the string just beyond the cuff of the sleeve.|$|R
25|$|Wrist-length <b>mittens</b> {{used to be}} {{commonly}} made of seal or caribou {{skin with}} the fur and the rough edge of the seam on the outside. Sealskin <b>mittens</b> were frequently made from leftover pieces of skin after boots were cut from them. The back and palm were separate pieces and the thumb one piece; gloves were unknown. Women wore fur <b>mittens</b> reaching nearly to the elbow with wolverine trim along the upper edge. <b>Mittens</b> of silver salmon skins which reached to the elbow were worn by men when hunting in a kayak in spring. The fish were cut down the back and the belly skins used for <b>mittens.</b> These sometimes were lined with grass or had grass <b>mittens,</b> woven all in one piece, inside; often they had a border of bleached sealskin. The combination of fish skin <b>mittens</b> with grass padding was less bulky for paddling than fur <b>mittens.</b> According to Curtis (1930, p.11), <b>mittens</b> of dehaired sealskin that reached barely to the wrist were also worn by men in the spring.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Mittens</b> : Attached <b>mittens</b> were {{occasionally}} seen on sleepers {{made for}} infants, usually to prevent finger or thumb sucking, but also served the dual purpose {{of keeping the}} hands warm. <b>Mittens</b> {{can also be used}} on costume sleepers for both children and adults ...|$|R
5|$|Several armies in the Second World War in Northern European {{countries}} preferred separate winter uniforms {{rather than}} oversuits. The Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, {{as well as}} white winter oversuits. Other German units fighting in Eastern Europe were at first poorly equipped for winter, having {{to make do with}} ordinary summer uniforms, but in the winter of 1942 to 1942 new white two-piece hooded oversuits with long <b>mitten</b> gauntlets started to arrive. American troops in Europe in the winter of 1944 to 1945 improvised snow capes and helmet covers from white cloth such as bed linen.|$|E
5|$|The club {{found it}} {{difficult}} to adjust to the Second Division and were nearly further relegated in the 1937–38 season, when they were spared on goal averages. However, when World War II broke in 1939, Newcastle had a chance to regroup, and in the War period, they brought in Jackie Milburn, Tommy Walker and Bobby Cowell. They were finally promoted back to the First Division {{at the end of the}} 1947–48 season. During the 1950s, Newcastle won the FA Cup trophy on three occasions within a five-year period, beating Blackpool in 1951, Arsenal in 1952, and Manchester City in 1955. However, after this last FA Cup victory the club fell back into decline and were relegated to the Second Division once again at the end of the 1960–61 season under the management of Charlie <b>Mitten.</b> <b>Mitten</b> left after one season in the Second Division and was replaced by former player Joe Harvey. Newcastle returned to the First Division at the end of the 1964–65 season after winning the Second Division title. Under Harvey, the club qualified for European competition for the first time after a good run in the 1967–68 season and the following year won the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final, triumphing 6–2 over two legs against Hungary's Újpest in the final.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Liddell {{became one}} of many players to be offered a {{transfer}} to Colombia by agents representing Independiente Santa Fe and Club Deportivo Los Millonarios. The clubs belonged to the DIMAYOR, unrecognised by FIFA because of a dispute between the league and the domestic governing body. Restrictions in England limited the weekly wage (£12 in the season and £10 during the summer) and impeded a player's ability to transfer to another club, which caused much discontent in British football until the system was reformed in the 1960s. Liddell chose to reject the contract offer, reportedly estimated at £12,000. His wife Phyllis, whom he married in 1946, later attributed the decision to club loyalty and the recent birth of twins. He later recalled that the proposal had been tempting, acknowledging that the decision {{would have been more}} challenging {{had it not been for}} the births. Many footballers did agree to contracts, including Alfredo Di Stefano, Neil Franklin, Charlie <b>Mitten,</b> and Hector Rial.|$|E

5|$|Of the 127 {{bird species}} found along the Merced River, only 35 occur {{along the entire}} length of the river. Many of these birds are migratory and only pass the area a few times every year, while 109 species of birds are found only in the {{breeding}} season. Birds are more abundant along the slow-moving lower river, which has more suitable riparian habitat compared to the rocky, swift upper river. Common species of bird throughout the basin include ruby-crowned kinglet, cedar waxwing, American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, tree swallow and European starling, and several endangered species, including white-tailed kite and Swainson's hawk. Birds that occur commonly in the middle and upper sections of the Merced River include mourning dove, Cassin's finch, California quail, dark-eyed junco, woodpecker, dipper, great blue heron, scrub jay, red-winged blackbird, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, cliff swallow, canyon wren, merganser, and bald eagles. Common insects found along the river include mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies. The river is impacted by invasive Asiatic clam, Chinese <b>mitten</b> crab, and New Zealand mud snail.|$|E
5|$|The PTC's {{response}} to the strike was anemic and was interpreted by some contemporary observers and later historians as tacitly supporting the strike. Arthur <b>Mitten,</b> chairman of the company's Industrial Relations Division, stopped by the Luzerne carbarn and asked the workers to return to work. Subsequently, he suggested that WMC temporarily suspend the non-discrimination order, and even brought a pile of freshly printed fliers with a suspension announcement to the WMC offices. However, the WMC officials refused to approve suspension of the FEPC order and Mitten's suspension fliers were not distributed. On the morning of August 1, PTC officials immediately shut down the high-speed lines, even before the strike had spread, and instructed the company supervisors to stop selling tickets. The PTC left its carbarns open, which allowed the strikers to use the carbarns as rallying points and coordinating centers for their activities. The company also cancelled the regularly scheduled meeting of its executive committee, where the {{response to}} the strike could have been discussed, and refused to join the TWU in a radio broadcast urging the strikers to return to work.|$|E

5000|$|Surprised at {{his first}} {{feelings}} of hunger, Bolt is shown by <b>Mittens</b> how {{to act like a}} cute, but needy dog, and is rewarded by food for the both of them at a nearby RV park in Elmwood Place, Ohio. Here, they meet Rhino (Mark Walton), a fearless, TV-obsessed hamster and Bolt fan who joins their team. Rhino’s unwavering faith in Bolt substantiates the dog’s illusions about his superpowers, but <b>Mittens,</b> who learned from Rhino that Bolt is from a television show, tries to convince Bolt that his superpowers aren't real. Bolt refuses to listen to <b>Mittens,</b> and instead becomes frustrated and attempts to [...] "superbark" [...] her repeatedly. The noise attracts Animal Control, who captures them both and transports them to an animal shelter. After being freed en route by Rhino, Bolt finally realizes that he is just a normal dog, but regains his confidence after Rhino (oblivious to this revelation) gives him a pep talk. They rescue <b>Mittens</b> from the shelter and escape, allowing them to continue their journey. Along the way, <b>Mittens</b> helps Bolt through his identity crisis by teaching him typical dog activities (such as hanging his head out car windows and chasing sticks), but <b>Mittens</b> refuses to go farther than Las Vegas. She tells Bolt that his Hollywood life is fake and there is no real love for him there. Her emotional rant reveals that she was once a house cat, but was abandoned by her previous owner and left to brave the harsh streets alone and declawed. Bolt refuses to believe that Penny doesn't love him, and continues on alone, wishing <b>Mittens</b> the best. Rhino, learning of Bolt's departure, convinces <b>Mittens</b> that they must help him, and the two set off to find Bolt once again.|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} mittens {{known to}} archeologists date to around 1000 A.D. in Latvia. Mittens {{continue to be}} part of Latvian national costume today. Wool biodegrades quickly, so it is likely that earlier mittens, possibly in other countries, may have existed but were not preserved. An exception is the specimen found during the excavations of the Early Medieval trading town of Dorestad in the Netherlands. In the harbour area a <b>mitten</b> of wool was discovered dating from the 8th or early 9th century.|$|E
25|$|The first boxing rules, {{called the}} Broughton's rules, were {{introduced}} by champion Jack Broughton in 1743 to protect fighters {{in the ring}} where deaths sometimes occurred.

Broughton encouraged the use of 'mufflers', a form of padded bandage or <b>mitten,</b> {{to be used in}} 'jousting' or sparring sessions in training, and in exhibition matches.|$|E
