Fuel coolant reactions may fragment the volcanic material by propagating stress waves, widening cracks and increasing surface area that ultimately leads to rapid cooling and explosive contraction-driven eruptions.|$|E

5|$|Although Charles {{had been}} criticised {{severely}} for granting the large ransom payment to the Vikings, {{he had other}} <b>more</b> <b>critical</b> issues to deal with at the same time, including disputes with his brothers, regional revolts and disgruntled nobles, as well as pressure from abroad. Since he would have trouble trusting his own counts to assemble and lead troops to defeat Ragnar's large force militarily, paying them off instead would buy Charles time, and possibly peace from further Viking raids—at least in the near future.|$|E

The {{generally}} accepted view of Bligh as an overbearing monster and Christian as a tragic victim of circumstances, {{as depicted in}} well-known film accounts, has been challenged by late 20th- and 21st-century historians from whom a more sympathetic picture of Bligh, and a <b>more</b> <b>critical</b> one of Christian, has emerged.|$|E
5|$|Entertainment Weekly, the Los Angeles Times, and The New York Times Book Review {{considered}} Middlesex one of {{the best}} books of 2002, and some scholars believed the novel should be considered for the title of Great American Novel. Generally, reviewers felt that the novel succeeded in portraying its Greek immigrant drama and were also impressed with Eugenides' depiction of his hometown of Detroit—praising him for his social commentary. Reviewers from the medical, gay, and intersex communities mostly praised Middlesex, though some intersex commentators have been <b>more</b> <b>critical.</b> In 2007, the book was featured in Oprah's Book Club.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} after his death, Scott's status as tragic hero was unchallenged, and few {{questions}} were asked {{about the causes of}} the disaster which overcame his polar party. In the final quarter of the 20th century the expedition came under closer scrutiny, and <b>more</b> <b>critical</b> views were expressed about its organization and management. The degree of Scott's personal culpability, and more recently, the culpability of certain expedition members, remain controversial.|$|E
5|$|Game Revolution had a <b>more</b> <b>critical</b> {{review of}} Dino Crisis than others, saying the game {{expanded}} on the worse elements of Resident Evil while also ruining the good elements. They {{were impressed by}} the graphics but thought the environments looked too similar and got boring after a short time. Overall, they believed the game to be worse than Resident Evil 2, pointing out the game's shorter length, more tedious puzzles, weaker action, and lesser scare factor.|$|E
5|$|Innes' {{case against}} Marshall {{ended in a}} hung jury in 1814. Rather than retry the case, Marshall and Innes signed an {{agreement}} to end the legal battle in 1815.

5|$|Smuts's {{religious}} observance was unsurprising in one who whose moral outlook was based exclusively upon Biblical teachings {{and who was}} destined for a future in the Church.

5|$|Suslov was {{becoming}} progressively <b>more</b> <b>critical</b> of Khrushchev's policies, his political intransigence, and {{his campaign to}} eliminate {{what was left of}} the old Stalinist guard. There were also deep-seated divergences in foreign and domestic policy between Suslov and Khrushchev. Suslov opposed the idea of improving Soviet Union–United States relations, and was against Khrushchev's attempts at rapprochement with Yugoslavia. Domestically, Suslov opposed Khrushchev's policy of de-Stalinisation and his economic decentralisation scheme.|$|E

5|$|After Hitler {{took control}} in Germany in 1933, Borah thought {{well of the}} new chancellor's {{repudiation}} of the war guilt and other clauses of the Versailles treaty, and saw much of value in his new social and economic programs. But he was utterly disgusted and alienated by the Nazi treatment of the Jews. This did not initially lead him {{to speak out against}} Nazi Germany, though many urged him to do so, as he felt that each nation had the right to run its own affairs. Borah opposed large-scale immigration by Jews from Germany, feeling that was impractical with millions of Americans unemployed. By 1938, Borah was speaking out against the continued persecutions, but still felt that the European issue could be settled if Germany's former colonies were returned. After the Munich Conference in September 1938, Borah issued a statement far <b>more</b> <b>critical</b> of Britain and France for deceiving Czechoslovakia into dismemberment, than of Germany for her aggression.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} both sides claimed victory and modern views {{as to who}} won the battle remain contradictory. Because the war was almost over and the battle had no {{strategic}} impact on the ongoing Battle of Berlin, German historiography has focused more on its tactical aspects. The German operation successfully recaptured Bautzen and its surroundings, which were held {{until the end of}} the war. Polish historiography during the People's Republic of Poland portrayed the battle as difficult, but victorious. After the fall of communism, Polish historians became much <b>more</b> <b>critical</b> of Świerczewski's command, blaming the near destruction of the Polish force on his incompetence and desire to capture Dresden. The battle's outcome is now generally seen in Poland as a very costly victory for the Soviets and their Polish allies.|$|E
