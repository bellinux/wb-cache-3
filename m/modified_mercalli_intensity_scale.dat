40|$|Estimating {{building}} damage due {{to strong}} earthquake ground motions {{is a difficult}} endeavor. Various earthquake <b>intensity</b> <b>scales,</b> such as the field survey-based <b>Modified</b> <b>Mercalli</b> <b>Intensity</b> (MMI) <b>scale</b> and the instrument-based Instrumental <b>Modified</b> <b>Mercalli</b> <b>Intensity</b> (Imm) <b>scale,</b> are {{used to describe the}} strength of ground shaking during an earthquake. If ground motion recording stations are available in the affected area, the current approach employed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to estimate the shaking intensity is the automated Imm approach, in which the peak values of ground acceleration and ground velocity are used. As rapid as it is, this instrument-only based approach does not account for the characteristics of buildings and, therefore, may not provide useful information about the damage state of the built environment following an earthquake. ^ Studies have shown that this method cannot estimate the degree of building damage accurately. The inaccuracy can be attributed mainly to the following: (1) ground shaking intensity is an ambiguous representation of building damage, and (2) structural damage does not depend solely on the ground motion but also on how the structure interacts with ground shaking, which depends on the characteristics of the buildings. ^ This research focuses on finding reliable building damage indicators using the inspection records of 104, 025 buildings surveyed {{in the aftermath of the}} 17 January 1994 Northridge, California earthquake and publicly available ground motion records from that earthquake. In this study, damage is represented using damage severity levels as prescribed by the inspectors. Each structure is associated with the ground motion parameters obtained from the closest ground motion recording station or the closest geographic grid point provided by the USGS. As the nature of the dependent and some of the independent variables are ordered and integer-valued, besides the regular statistical correlation analysis, a random parameter ordered probit statistical model is considered in the study. A critical evaluation of parameters that have strong influence on building damage is provided. The impact of distance to recording station on observed correlations is also presented. ...|$|R

40|$|The oldest {{recorded}} {{earthquake in}} South Africa is widely accepted (in several seismic catalogues) {{to have occurred}} on 07 April 1620. This earthquake was regarded as having a <b>Modified</b> <b>Mercalli</b> <b>Scale</b> <b>intensity</b> of II-IV, corresponding to a Richter Scale Magnitude of ~ 4. An examination of the original sources on which the record of this earthquake rests, reveals that {{it was based on}} a description of ‘two startling thunderclaps like cannon shots while ship was becalmed near Robben Island’ by Augustin de Beaulieu, who was the head of a fleet of three ships which put in Table Bay in March–April 1620. A full excerpt of Beaulieu’s account reveals that the thunderclaps took place {{in a short period of}} calm during an extended period of stormy weather, and that the observations were made on board ship, so that no seismic ground vibration was felt. The Western Cape has a much lower incidence of lightning than the interior of South Africa, and the fact that the thunderclaps were not accompanied by lightning is not unusual. Thus the simplest explanation of the thunderclaps is that they were the result of atmospheric phenomena, and not a result of seismic activity, as interpreted by J. N. Theron in 1974. The events of 07 April 1620 should thus be removed from the catalogues of historical seismicity in South Africa, making the slight shock felt in Cape Town in 1690, with a <b>Modified</b> <b>Mercalli</b> <b>Scale</b> <b>intensity</b> of III, the oldest recorded seismic tremor in the history of South Africa...|$|R

30|$|Reports {{from the}} {{previous}} section have shown that Africa is prone to seismic activities of varying magnitudes especially the regions around the EARS. These seismic activities have caused serious damage to properties, reduced the quality of living and even led to instabilities in economies {{of some of the}} affected nations. The intensity of seismic events is often measured on the <b>Modified</b> <b>Mercalli</b> <b>Intensity</b> (MMI) <b>scale</b> which provides information on the observed effects of the event (extent of vibration) on people (and other living things), objects and buildings /infrastructures around the region of occurrence (Midzi et al. 2013). The information on the scale maybe subjective to accounts of residents in the area where the event took place, but it gives a guide on the extent of damage and shock per event. Studies have shown that the intensity of earthquakes in Africa vary between I and VIII, signifying that earthquakes around the African continent range from minimal or no effect to slight damages on well-designed buildings. Although the damages have not been very severe, it is necessary to devise earthquake mitigating methods, since the continent is known to undergo intra-plate earthquakes which increase the frequency of earthquake occurrences {{on the surface of the}} earth.|$|R

30|$|East Africa {{is one of}} {{the first}} regions to be {{considered}} seismic in Africa, and this was because of the occurrence of earthquakes with high magnitude and intensities. It has been established from geological studies that the seismicity of this region (Eastern Africa) is linked to its situation along the East African rift system. The active seismicity of this region therefore instigated early efforts to establish seismic codes for design of buildings and other civil structures. Kenya seismic code was one of the first seismic code to be established in East Africa and in the whole of Africa as a continent (Worku 2014). Worku (2014) reported that the Kenyan seismic code was reported to be established in 1973, and the code used the <b>Modified</b> <b>Mercalli</b> <b>Intensity</b> (MMI) <b>scale</b> to map out region of seismic hazards in the country. Unfortunately, this code has not been revised since that year (1973) and may not be a reliable measure to reduce the risk associated with earthquakes in event of their future occurrence. This is because the structures which are currently being erected in Kenya in the present day are not the same used for establishment of the seismic code, and the changing nature of geological activities beneath the earth’s crust would affect the extent and nature of ground shaking/vibrations during future events (earthquakes).|$|R

This was modified and published in English by Harry O. Wood and Frank Neumann in 1931 as the Mercalli-Wood-Neumann (MWN) scale.

Modern seismic-zonation practice accounts for the differences in seismic hazard posed by varying geologic conditions.

Intensity values for 1906 range from MMI 6 to 9, {{with an average of}} 7. 4. For damage data grouped by modern census blocks, the small variation in intensity within blocks indicates the 1906 intensity values estimated here reflected true ground motion. Within the 12 -km by 12 -km study area, different microzones from about 1. 0 to 16. 8 km 2 in size had characteristic 1906 intensities ranging from 6. 6 to 8. 2. Variations in 1906 intensity over small areas were correlated with site-specific geologic factors, primarily slowness of shear-wave velocity in the top 30 m (1 /V s 30), thickness of unconsolidated sediment, proximity to buried basin edges, and likely resonance between shallow ground layers and buildings. Distance to the San Andreas fault and 1906 epicenter, depth to bedrock basement, surficial geologic map unit, and liquefaction did not control 1906 intensity. Agreement with modern ground-motion studies suggests that areas of high or low intensity have persisted through time...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{relationships}} between the macroseismic intensity and the ground-motion parameters for the Himalayan region are derived in this study. A strong-motion database from 21 moderate-to-large earthquakes, along with their corresponding macroseismic intensity, is considered. All the intensity values are inferred from isoseismal maps and earthquake damage reports and then converted to the <b>modified</b> <b>Mercalli</b> <b>intensity</b> (MMI) <b>scale.</b> An orthogonal regression analysis is used {{to find the best}} correlation between MMI and peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV), and pseudospectral acceleration (PSA) at 0. 3, 1. 0, 2. 0, and 3. 0 s to accommodate the uncertainty in the regression coefficients. In addition to the ground-motion parameters, the MMI is related to other potential independent variables, including the moment magnitude, the hypocentral distance, and the 30 -m average shear-wave velocity (V-S 30). The study shows that site effect is noticed predominantly in the MMI-PGA relationship for a hypocentral distance of more than 200 km. When relating MMI with PGV, PSA(0). (3 s), PSA(1. 0 s), PSA(2. 0 s), and PSA(3. 0 s), however, the contribution of site effects to the correlation is negligible. To eradicate the site effect in the PGA-MMI relationship, the derived empirical relationship is modified, based on the statistical analysis of MMI observed and MMI predicted, with or without including V-S 30 as a potential independent variable. Furthermore, the developed regression models are verified using several statistical tests, the F-test, the t-test, the Durbin-Watson test, and the Breusch-Pagan test. Additionally, the Euclidean distance concept is evaluated in the study. It was concluded that the PGA is a good indicator for deriving the MMI value in the Himalayan region, but that one should use site-specific MMI versus PGV and MMI versus PSA relationships to predict reliable parameters...|$|R
40|$|<b>Intensity</b> <b>scales</b> {{define the}} {{criteria}} {{used to determine}} different levels of shaking in relation to environmental effects. Objective evaluations of low intensity degrees based on transient effects may be difficult. In particular, estimations {{for the number of}} people feeling an earthquake are critical, and are qualitatively described by words such as “few”, “many”, and “most” for determining various intensity levels. In general, such qualitative amounts are converted into specific percentages for each macroseismic scale. Additionally, estimations of macroseismic intensity are influenced by variables that are mentioned in macroseismic scale degree descriptions. For example, the Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg (MCS; Sieberg, 1930) and the <b>Modified</b> <b>Mercalli</b> <b>Intensity</b> (MMI) <b>scales</b> (Wood and Neumann, 1931) describe the intensity II as “Felt only by a few people, extremely susceptible, in perfectly quiet situations, almost always on the upper floors of buildings”. Another example is the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS) (Grunthal, 1998) that describes the intensity V as “felt indoors by most, outdoors by few. Many sleeping people awake”. In this work, we focus on two variables referred to as people’s physical “situation” (what were you doing?), here categorized as “sleeping”, “at rest”, or “in motion”; and the observer’s “location”, here categorized as “higher floors”, “lower floors”, and “outdoors”. Both variables have a partial influence on intensity assessments because they condition vibration perception. However, it is important to study, using an experimental method, the weights of these variables in the quantification of felt effects. Musson (2005 a) also recognized the influence of such conditions on the number of people feeling an earthquake, stating that the proportion of people in different conditions “are generally difficult to quantify in any case”. Today, we have a large amount of data available through the macroseismic web site “haisentitoilterremoto” associated with specific observer conditions. Using this data, a study of these effects is possible. For this analysis, we placed attention on transitory effects that, in the past, could not be easily studied due to the intrinsic difficulty in collecting this type of data. The aim of this work was to specifically analyze and quantify how the observer’s “situation” and “location” influence earthquake perception suggesting a new scale description that can be easily used for low intensity estimation...|$|R

The German physicist August Heinrich Sieberg executed the change and called it the Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg (MCS) scale which became popular in Europe.

The epicentre was located near the town of Basantkot (Muzaffarabad), and the focal depth was about 13 km. The Muzaffarabad earthquake provides unequivocal evidence about the localization of severe damage, intense ground shaking and secondary environmental effects near the surface expression of the source fault. We analyse its nature, and impact on man-made structures and the physical environment, on the basis of a detailed survey and macroseismic study of the affected areas conducted by the Micro Seismic Studies Programme (MSSP) Team (Ishfaq Ahmad Research Laboratories, Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission) immediately after the mainshock, assisted by a careful review of the subsequent data and literature. In the course of the field survey, the displacement and surface expression of the causative fault, and accompanying secondary environmental effects were observed at a number of places along a capable thrust fault structure. We refer to this structure as the Kashmir Thrust (KT) capable fault following the terminology of local research geologists in Pakistan; the seismological evidence of this structure is already known in the literature as the Indus-Kohistan Seismic Zone. A complex, clearly segmented, at least 112 -km-long surface rupture was mapped along the KT. The maximum values of vertical displacement (on the order of 4 to 7 m) were observed mainly between Muzaffarabad and Balakot, along the central segment of the rupture (52 km) associated with maximum slip at depth and a major portion of the energy release. Both the NW Alai segment (38 km) and SE Bagh segment (22 km) are characterized by scattered minor surface ruptures with a few centimetres of displacement, accompanied by extensive surface cracking, landslides and severe damage, concentrated in a narrow belt along the fault trace. A maximum intensity of XI on the <b>Modified</b> <b>Mercalli</b> <b>Intensity</b> (MMI) <b>scale</b> and on the Environmental Seismic <b>Intensity</b> <b>scale</b> (ESI 2007) was recorded in the epicentral area between Muzaffarabad and Balakot.

30|$|Catastrophe {{modeling}} has conventionally {{been designed}} as a probabilistic model that estimates losses based on risk and vulnerability of exposure units for a foreseeable set of events. Factors affecting the estimates of losses of an exposure unit include site location, physical characteristics, and the financial terms of insurance coverage. Site locations are denoted as geocoding data such as street address, postal code, and country/CRESTA (Catastrophe Risk Evaluating and Standardizing Target Accumulations) zone. Physical characteristics describe the construction, occupancy status, year built, and number of stories of the building. Financial terms refer to the value, limit, and deductible of the coverage. In the case of earthquakes, a probable earthquake magnitude is simulated based on a catalogue of historical records of earthquakes within the region of concern. The {{next step is to}} estimate the <b>Modified</b> <b>Mercalli</b> <b>Scale</b> <b>Intensities</b> (MMI) of the region according to the distance from the quake’s epicenter, the focal depth and magnitude of the earthquake, and the geological structures at the location. Often these factors are accounted for with empirical attenuation equations for each geological structure. Different attenuation equations for each geological structure are needed to consider their differences in seismic wave propagation characteristics. Softer sediment would tend to amplify shaking, but would affect a smaller radius to the epicenter. Hard sediments or rocks experience lower shaking intensity, but the shaking can be felt at much larger distances from the epicenter. The MMI is thereafter correlated to the building physical characteristics and financial terms to estimate the damage losses. Different building physical characteristics yield different sets of vulnerability curves. This methodology is highly suitable for quantifying losses over a wide area or for portfolios with large number of buildings. Precise building damage estimation is often not the prime concern.|$|R
