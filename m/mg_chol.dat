As a rich source of MUFA, pecans should represent a non-hyperlipidemic fat addition in isocaloric diets of equivalent SFA content. In this study hypercholesterolemic (mean ? SD serum total cholesterol, 5. 76 ? 0. 85 mmol/L) men and women with a pre-entry fat intake similar to an AHA Step I diet (32 % fat, 10 % SFA, 9. 6 % MUFA, 5. 6 % PUFA and 237 <b>mg</b> <b>CHOL</b> per day) participated in an 8 week, randomized, controlled feeding trial. Forty subjects (26 women, 14 men; mean age 55 y, range 22 - 71) were fed one of two diets: an AHA Step I diet (31 % fat: 9. 9 % SFA, 9. 2 % MUFA, 5. 5 % PUFA and 225 <b>mg</b> <b>CHOL)</b> or an isocaloric but higher fat percent pecan-based diet (40 % fat: 8. 4 % SFA, 17 % MUFA, 9. 9 % PUFA and 203 <b>mg</b> <b>CHOL).</b> There {{was no significant difference in}} SFA intake between either treatment group; MUFA intake increased by 17. 4 gm, from 19. 8 to 37. 2 gm per day, and PUFA intake increased 9. 74 gm, from 11. 5 to 21. 2 gm per day. Dietary compliance was excellent as judged by changes in proportions of n- 9 to n- 7 fatty acids within individual plasma lipid classes. Serum lipids, density fractionated lipoproteins, apolipoproteins (Apo B 100, Apo AI, Lp(a)), and acute phase proteins (CRP, SAA) were analyzed on all subjects at the end of the initial run-in period and at the end of the diet period by repeated measures analysis of variance (SAS, ProcGLM) with significance set at p 0. 2). As a rich nutrient source, pecans significantly increased dietary fiber, beta-carotene, thiamin, magnesium, copper, and manganese, normalizing inadequate magnesium and copper intake. Results of this study indicate that altering the Step I diet to include 20 % of daily energy intake as whole pecans can be as effective as the Step I diet in maintaining plasma lipids...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} in ovo {{administration}} of {{different levels of}} betaine and choline on egg hatchability, immune response, growth and carcass traits of broiler chickens was studied. Four thousand hatching eggs from Ross 308 broiler breeder layers, weighed individually, were incubated for 21 days in a commercial hatchery. At 12 th day of incubation, 3456 fertilized eggs were randomly divided into 8 experimental groups of 3 replicates each (144 eggs per replicate) : negative control (NC) – not injected; positive control (PC) – injected with 0. 5 mL deionized water; Bet 0. 25 – injected with 0. 5 mL deionized water+ 0. 25 mg soluble betaine; Bet 0. 375 – injected with 0. 5 mL deionized water+ 0. 375 mg soluble betaine; Bet 0. 50 – injected with 0. 5 mL deionized water+ 0. 50 <b>mg</b> soluble betaine; <b>Chol</b> 0. 25 – injected with 0. 5 mL deionized water+ 0. 25 <b>mg</b> soluble choline; <b>Chol</b> 0. 375 – injected with 0. 5 mL deionized water+ 0. 375 <b>mg</b> soluble choline; <b>Chol</b> 0. 50 – injected with 0. 5 mL deionized water+ 0. 50 mg soluble choline. Among the hatched chickens, 360 males were randomly chosen (45 for each group) and were grown up to 42 nd day of age. The embryo mortality, pecked eggs, infected eggs and hatchability percentages were similar among the experimental groups. The betaine and choline treatments improved hatching weight and final weight of chickens, while reduced feed conversion ratio and abdominal fat percentage. No effect on carcass yield, and breast muscle, leg and wings percentages, {{as well as on}} immunoglobulin M (IgM), G (IgG), and total antibody (IgT) titers was observed. The treatments had little effect on internal organs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground and Objective: Some {{studies show}} that, {{there is a}} {{relationship}} between decrease of serum magnesium (Mg) level and the insulin resistance in diabetic type II patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the Mg level in in type II diabetic with non-diabetic individuals. Materials and Methods: Diabetic patients(n= 35) and control group (n= 35),< 35 years old, were randomly selected from the hospital of Imam Ali, Andimeshk. To compare diabetic patients and control group, the t-student statistical method and SPSS software, were used. Results: Mg levels in diabetic and non diabetic groups were 1. 33 ± 0. 27 and 1. 62 ± 0. 21 mg/dl, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (p= 0. 0000014). A reversed significant relationship was seen between FPG and Mg among type II diabetic patients, whereas no significant relationship was seen between Mg and other variables, (TG, Chol and HDL). In non-diabetics group, there was a reversed significant relationship between the <b>Mg</b> and <b>Chol,</b> Whereas, no relationship was seen between other variables and magnesium. Conclusion: In diabetic patients, with increased level of FPG, serum Mg levels were decreased significantly. Moreover, serum Mg levels in diabetic patients were significantly lower than non-diabetics. Keywords: Magnesium, Diabetes type 2, Cholesterol, Triglyceride, High density lipoprotei...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} to study the serum concentrations of blood components in the hypothyroidism, using the Wister strain rats. As a goitrogen, methylthiouracil (methiocil; 6 -methy I - 2 -thiouracil) was used. The compound was suspended in 2 % of aqueous sol of carboxymethyl cellulose and the suspension was injected into the stomach or injected subcutaneously. In one experiment, the goitrogen disolved partially in aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide was injected subcutaneously to the rats. The period of administration was 12 hours (4 times of injection, 3 hours interval) or of approximately one week, twice injection a day. The blood was taken at 3 hours following the final administration, and serum of the blood was determined for total protein(TP), albumin(Alb), globulin(Gl), glucose(Glu), blood ureal nitrogen(BUN), cholesterol(Chol), Calcium(Ca), magnesium(Mg), and phosphorus(P). By {{the administration of the}} goitrogen, serum concentrations of BUN, <b>Chol,</b> <b>Mg</b> increased and that of P decreased. Ratio of Alb/Gl in the serum concentration also was high in the group treated with methiocil in comparison with the control group. Oral treatment of methiocil increased only glycine among amino acids in the serum. The changes of concentration of blood serum component following the administration of goitrogen indicates that steer producing the beef with high degree of fat deposit {{is in a state of}} hypothyroidism...|$|R
