In November 1846, Isambard Kingdom Brunel's iron ship SS Great Britain ran aground on the sands of Dundrum Bay, Ireland. There was doubt as to whether she could be re-floated. Brunel advised that if anyone could rescue the ship then the <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it was the naval engineer James Bremner. He was engaged and the Great Britain was re-floated on 27 August 1847 {{with the assistance of}} HMS Birkenhead.|$|E
5|$|The {{literary}} critic G. Koster writes that, when writing Siti Akbari, Lie Kim Hok was {{limited by the}} formulaic Pandji romances and syair poems common in Malay literature at the time. Koster notes basic structural similarities between Siti Akbari and the existing poetic forms. The work followed the archetype of a hero or heroine going from a lawful kingdom into exile then into a chaotic kingdom, one which Koster suggests {{is representative of the}} cycle of oral law. Such an archetype and formulas were used in contemporary works such as Syair Siti Zubaidah Perang Cina (Poem on Siti Zubaidah and the War against China). The plot device of a woman passing herself as a <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> war was likewise common in Malay and Javanese literature. Lie deviated greatly from the established traditions, mixing European and native literary influences.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{was posted}} to a {{training}} {{wing of the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) at Hastings in Sussex before he moved with his unit to Torquay. He had mainly administrative duties, including instructing recruits, for whom he made life hard. He played some games of cricket in 1940 for various teams before being posted to Cairo in December. His responsibilities in Egypt included organising, promoting and playing in cricket matches. Posted there until 1943, {{he was promoted to}} flight lieutenant and then to squadron leader. While Hammond may have helped to raise morale, Cairo was an easy posting during the war and he was not involved directly in combat. He also spent much time in South Africa, where he played cricket and was reunited with Sybil Ness-Harvey. At the beginning of 1944, Hammond was posted back to England, where he lectured and drilled cadets. Playing as captain in many one-day cricket matches, he was praised by Wisden for encouraging exciting contests. Others applauded his batting, including his hitting of many sixes, fitting the games' relaxed atmosphere. In December 1944, Hammond, suffering from fibrositis, was discharged from the RAFVR on health grounds and returned to work at Marsham Tyres. Once the war ended in Europe in May 1945, several first-class matches were organised. Hammond played in six, scoring 592 runs at an average of 59.20 with two centuries. In a match for an England team against the Dominions at Lord's, he made a century in each innings, becoming the first <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this seven times.|$|E

5|$|With a {{combined}} total of 210 matches played, the Big Four have played many notable matches. The 2008 Wimbledon final and the 2012 Australian Open finals are {{considered by some}} to be the greatest matches of all time. Novak Djokovic saved match points against Roger Federer at the 2010 and 2011 US Open semifinals, whereas Federer ended Djokovic's 43-match winning streak in the 2011 French Open semifinals. The 4 hour 50 minute 2012 Australian Open semifinal between Murray and Djokovic is said to have given Murray the belief he needed to match {{the other members of the}} Big Four. Moreover, every Grand Slam tournament final of 2012, all played between the Big Four, holds some historical significance. The 2012 Australian Open final was the longest Grand Slam tournament final in terms of time played, the 2012 French Open saw Rafael Nadal break the record for the most number of titles at the French Open, whereas Djokovic was attempting to become the first man to hold all four Majors since Rod Laver in 1969. The 2012 Wimbledon final saw Federer equal the record for most Wimbledon titles when he came out victorious against Murray, who became the first British man since 1938 to appear in the final. The 2012 US Open final was the equal longest final in US Open history, and Murray became the first British man since 1938 to win a Major title, and the only British <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so in the Open Era. He also became the only man to win Olympic Singles Gold and the US Open back-to-back.|$|E

25|$|While {{this seemed}} fine in theory, in {{practice}} it had multiple problems. The most prominent {{of all was}} that the arming method did not work as intended. In many cases pulling the loop was too difficult for one <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and it required two men. For a lone soldier, the best method was to hold the grenade between the knees and pull on the loop with both hands. However, this often resulted in cutting the fingers in addition to igniting the fuse.|$|E
25|$|Tate {{continues}} to hold {{the record for the}} most wickets in a season outside England (116 in 1926-7 in India/Ceylon, average 13.78; he also scored 1,193 runs in that season and is the only <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a 'double' outside England). He achieved the exceptional double of 1,000 runs and 200 wickets in a season three years running (1923, 1924 and 1925). His career total of 2,784 wickets (average 18.16) is the 11th highest ever, and with 21,717 runs (average 25.01) he is one of only nine people ever to get a career double of 20,000 runs and 2,000 wickets. He took three hat tricks in his career. He was Wisden Cricketer of the year in 1924.|$|E
25|$|John Madden was {{the first}} person to have {{announced}} a Super Bowl for each of the four major U.S. television networks, having called five Super Bowls for CBS, three for Fox, and two for ABC prior to joining NBC in 2006. Meanwhile, Al Michaels was the third <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> play-by-play for a Super Bowl on NBC television (following in the footsteps of Curt Gowdy and Dick Enberg). Also, Michaels (who, like Madden, had moved from ABC to NBC in 2006) was the second person to serve as a Super Bowl play-by-play announcer for two major U.S. television networks (following Pat Summerall of CBS and Fox). This would prove to be the final game Madden would call, as he announced his retirement from broadcasting on April 16, 2009.|$|E

25|$|England {{came out}} to the evening session hoping to bat through losing one wicket maximum. Just a few overs in, Collingwood edged one through to the keeper, out for 5 off 36 balls. After that {{partnership}} in which 15 runs were scored for 75 balls, England had to bat more aggressively and Pietersen seemed the perfect <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that for the team. Cook started looking much more confident against Warne and soon he was one run away from his maiden Ashes century, not made easy by Warne but eventually, Cook got the run to bring up a 257-ball 100. The day had belonged firmly to England, but with just 3 overs left, McGrath took the wicket of Cook, edging behind to Gilchrist, and bowled nightwatchman Matthew Hoggard for a second-ball duck. McGrath proceeded to beat Flintoff with the remaining two balls, including an unsuccessful appeal for caught-behind. Flintoff and Pietersen, saw out the remaining overs, leaving England on 265 for 5.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, Tutu was {{nominated}} {{to be the}} new Bishop of Johannesburg, although lost out to Timothy Bavin. Bavin suggested that Tutu take his newly vacated position, that of the dean of St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg. Tutu was elected to this position—the fourth highest in South Africa's Anglican hierarchy—in March 1975, becoming the first black <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, an appointment making headline news in South Africa. Tutu decided to return to South Africa, a decision opposed by Leah, resulting in a strain on their marriage. Tutu was officially installed as dean in an August 1975 ceremony. The cathedral was packed for the event; in attendance was the TEF's chairman, Archibishop Karekin Sarkissian of the Armenian Orthodox Church. Moving to the city, Tutu lived not in the official dean's residence in the white suburb of Houghton but rather in a middle-class street in the Orlando West township of Soweto, a largely impoverished area for blacks. The cathedral's congregation was racially mixed but with a white majority; this mixing gave Tutu hope that a racially equal, de-segregated future was possible for South Africa. He attempted to modernise the liturgies used by the cathedral's congregation although found that this was not desired by most. He also divided opinion among the congregation for his support of the ordination of women and for replacing masculine pronouns with gender neutral ones in his sermons and liturgy.|$|E

500|$|Almost immediately, {{the signal}} {{began to be}} misquoted. A number of ships in the fleet {{recorded}} the signal as [...] "England expects every <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his duty" [...] (omitting that and replacing will with to). This version became so prevalent that it is recorded on Nelson's tomb in St. Paul's Cathedral. The word that is also omitted on the version {{around the base of}} Nelson's Column, as seen in the photo above. However, the Victorys log and the accounts of signal officer John Pasco and Henry Blackwood (captain of the frigate Euryalus), both present at the preparation of the signal, agree on the form given here. On 26 December 1805, The Times newspaper in London reported the signal as; [...] "England expects every officer and <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his duty this day". In 1811, the tenor John Braham composed a song, [...] "The Death of Nelson", including the words of the signal. The song became popular almost immediately and was performed throughout the British Empire during the 19th century. To make the words fit the metre, they were altered to [...] "England expects that every man this day will do his duty". This version of the wording is also persistent.|$|E
