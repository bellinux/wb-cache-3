5|$|After Khan's {{departure}} from Comilla, the cooperative's model failed in independent Bangladesh because {{only a few}} occupational groups managed to achieve the desired success. By 1979, only 61 of the 400 cooperatives were functioning. The model actually fell prey to the ineffective internal and external controls, stagnation, and diversion of funds. This prompted the subsequent scholars and practitioners in <b>microfinance,</b> such as Muhammad Yunus of Grameen Bank and Fazle Hasan Abed of BRAC, to abandon the cooperative approach in favour of more centralised control and service delivery structures. The new strategy targeted the poorest villagers, while excluding the 'less poor'. However, Khan's leadership skills {{during the course of}} his association with the project remained a source of inspiration for these leaders, as well as other participatory development initiatives in the country.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microfinancing</b> {{produces}} {{many benefits}} for poverty stricken, or low- income households. One {{of the benefits}} {{is that it is}} very accessible. Banks today simply won’t extend loans to those with little to no assets, and generally don’t engage in small size loans typically associated with <b>microfinancing.</b> Through <b>microfinancing</b> small loans are produced and accessible. <b>Microfinancing</b> is based on the philosophy that even small amounts of credit can help end the cycle of poverty. Another benefit produced from the <b>microfinancing</b> initiative is that it presents opportunities, such as extending education and jobs. Families receiving <b>microfinancing</b> are less likely to pull their children out of school for economic reasons. As well, in relation to employment, {{people are more likely to}} open small businesses that will aid the creation of new jobs. Overall, the benefits outline that the <b>microfinancing</b> initiative is set out to improve the standard of living amongst impoverished communities (Rutherford, 2009).|$|R

5|$|It targets {{the poorest}} of the poor, with a {{particular}} emphasis on women, who receive 95 percent of the bank's loans. Women traditionally had less access to financial alternatives of ordinary credit lines and incomes. They were seen to have an inequitable share of power in household decision making. Yunus and others have found that lending to women generates considerable secondary effects, including empowerment of a marginalised segment of society (Yunus and Jolis 1998), who share betterment of income with their children, unlike many men. Yunus claims that in 2004, women still have difficulty getting loans; they comprise less than 1 percent of borrowers from commercial banks (Yunus 2004). The interest rates charged by <b>microfinance</b> institutes including Grameen Bank is high compared to that of traditional banks; Grameen's interest (reducing balance basis) on its main credit product is about 20%.|$|E

We examined the Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction (CFPR) programme {{implemented by the}} Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) between 2002 and 2007, as it used an innovative approach to <b>microfinancing</b> by transferring assets rather than cash to ultra poor partici-pants. We examined two aspects: (i) the impact of <b>microfinancing</b> through asset transfer instead of cash on social innovation leading to poverty reduction; (ii) the factors that contributed to positive or {{negative impact on the}} economic conditions and poverty levels of the participant households and the trajectories of changes experienced by the success and failure cases. For this, we employed sur-vey data from twenty-one beneficiaries and eight in-depth interviews among these households. The study found that participants who demonstrated proper planning, hard work and personal interest in the enterprise through <b>microfinancing</b> have witnessed improved quality of life and poverty reduction, while lack of motivation, absence of proper planning and certain social barriers resulted in failure. Our study makes two major contributions: (i) it fills a gap in the literature on <b>microfinancing</b> of social innovation to help ultra poor households to graduate out of poverty; (ii) it provides policy alterna-tives for designing appropriate <b>microfinancing</b> programmes for ultra poor which can produce hig...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the effect of operational efficiency, gender of the borrowers and the population density on the performance of <b>microfinancing</b> institutions that {{play a significant role in}} alleviating poverty in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach - A model showing the relationships among the variables is first proposed based on the hypotheses developed in the literature review. Then the model is tested with empirical data using multiple regression and path analysis. Data used in the analysis relate to 234 <b>microfinancing</b> institutions across 63 countries. Findings - The study finds that operational efficiency and gender of the borrowers have a direct impact on the performance of <b>microfinancing</b> institutions. Although population density does not have a direct impact on performance it has an indirect effect through operational efficiency and gender of the borrowers. Practical implications - The findings of this study reveal to the policy makers and managers of <b>microfinancing</b> institutions the importance of focussing on the three factors analysed (operational efficiency, gender of the borrowers and population density) to reduce poverty. Originality/value - The study enhances the current knowledge in the literature relating to <b>microfinancing.</b> The findings help to improve the performance of <b>microfinancing</b> institutions resulting in efficient and effective utilisation of hundreds of millions of donor funds originating from tax payers in developed countries.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the status, impediments and prospects for <b>microfinancing</b> of smallholder forestry on Leyte Island, the Philippines. Surveys {{were conducted to}} determine the availability of <b>microfinancing</b> {{as well as the}} interest of landholders and finance providers in <b>microfinancing.</b> Representatives from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and Department of Agriculture (DA) were also interviewed with regard to their views regarding the prospects of <b>microfinancing.</b> The study was designed to provide information to support policy-makers and planners in devising incentive packages for smallholder forestry. It was found that there is limited <b>microfinancing</b> available for forestry on Leyte Island. The arrangement is generally for projects of DENR whereby participants are given financial support to develop a particular area or carry out a particular forestry activity. The majority of the respondents who established their own tree farms did not receive any external support from the government or any other private donors. A few, however, benefited from the seedlings distributed free by DENR and DA. On the other hand, 53 % of the respondents (most with relatively low incomes) signified interest in <b>microfinancing</b> for forestry if ever it becomes available, subject to the acceptability of loan arrangements.

30|$|While <b>microfinancing</b> {{is vital}} in the {{investment}} {{and expansion of}} microenterprises and small firms (Aldaba, 2011), the utilization of capital may be another cause of growth constraint among micro and small firms. <b>Microfinancing</b> is indicated by the sources of capital of the small firm owners. Armendáriz and Morduch (2010) defined <b>microfinancing</b> as access to financial services to benefit low-income borrowers by providing capital to microenterprises. Small firm owners can obtain <b>microfinancing</b> from the following four sources: financing from the bank, non-bank sources, own personal savings (and borrowing from friends and relatives), and {{a combination of these}} sources. Largely, external financing is assumed to be the biggest source of capital. Krishnaswamy (2007) argued that borrowing capital increases the opportunity of small firms to boost productivity. Beck and Demirguc-Kunt (2006), for their part, posited that banks {{play a significant role in}} providing capital for micro, small, and medium enterprises. This notion suggests that bank credit is imperative in supplying reasonable and flexible capital to microenterprises. However, the difficulty of complying with requirements discourages microenterprises from borrowing. The reluctance of banks to support the capital needs of the small firm borrower affects their initiative to grow. Wang (2016) claimed that collateral, processing, and asymmetric information are among the challenges that borrowers have experienced with banks.|$|R
