50|$|Unlike <b>modus</b> ponendo <b>ponens</b> and <b>modus</b> ponendo tollens, {{with which}} {{it should not be}} confused, {{disjunctive}} syllogism is often not made an explicit rule or axiom of logical systems, as the above arguments can be proven with a (slightly devious) combination of reductio ad absurdum and disjunction elimination.|$|R

Non-violent video games are defined in the negative by a <b>Modus</b> tollendo <b>ponens</b> disjunctive argument. In other words, in order to recognize a non-violent game, an identifier must recognize the violent game as a distinct class. This has led to a degree of ambiguity in the term as it relies upon a definition of violence which for different identifiers may mean different things. In general, violence may be placed into at least three distinct categories: ...|$|R

H0 satisfies conditions THEN-1 through FALSE because all formulas of the given forms are axioms of intuitionist logic.

40|$|Conditional {{sentences}} are {{pervasive in}} human communication. Many arguments contain conditional premises or a conditional conclusion. The expression conditional reasoning could appropriately {{be applied to}} such arguments. However, there is a tradition in psychological research, which will be followed here, to restrict {{the use of this}} expression to refer to twopremise arguments that have one conditional premise (called the major), and a second premise (called the minor) made of either the antecedent of the conditional or its negation, or the consequent of the conditional or its negation.

40|$|Argumentative thought {{experiments}} are structurally conditional clauses. They can hence be formalized {{by means of}} the principle of <b>modus</b> ponendo <b>ponens,</b> as well as of modus tollendo tollens. In contrast to the practice in formal logic, exponents of argumentative thought experiments claim that the logical validity of a conclusion drawn within the framework of a particular conditional argument also holds beyond the particular conditional in question. In this paper, I articulate the criticism that this claim is wrong by arguing that the counterfactual scenario sets itself the most determinant premise. If the counterfactual scenario sets the initial conditional premise of the argument, then its true conclusion holds only as a counterfactual truth. The present paper illustrates this criticism using Frank Jackson’s thought experiment, the so-called knowledge argument, as a concrete example...|$|R
40|$|From a {{philosophical}} point of view, {{the theory of}} forms is the central topic in Plato’s dialogues; however, {{there is only one}} single direct argument for the existence of forms. The paper deals with the logical form of this argument in Timaeus 51 d 3 - 52 a 7, and it corrects and clarifies some points made in a former paper on the same topic (Ferber, Gymnasium 105, 1998, 419 - 444). It is shown that the argument is logically valid; it is a <b>modus</b> ponendo <b>ponens.</b> The two premises of the argument are true (and the argument is therefore sound) if one accepts a Platonic distinction between knowledge (Greek “nous” in the sense of “episteme”) and true belief. The paper also presents an alternative Aristotelian reading of the premises...|$|R
25|$|This can {{be shown}} as follows: Every proof in propositional {{calculus}} uses only axioms and the inference rules. Each use of an axiom scheme yields a true logical formula, and can thus be proven in sequent calculus; examples for these are shown below. The only inference rule in the systems mentioned above is <b>modus</b> <b>ponens,</b> which is implemented by the cut rule.|$|E
25|$|The {{preceding}} alternative calculus is {{an example}} of a Hilbert-style deduction system. In the case of propositional systems the axioms are terms built with logical connectives and the only inference rule is <b>modus</b> <b>ponens.</b> Equational logic as standardly used informally in high school algebra is a different kind of calculus from Hilbert systems. Its theorems are equations and its inference rules express the properties of equality, namely that it is a congruence on terms that admits substitution.|$|E
25|$|A {{deduction}} in a Hilbert-style deductive {{system is}} a list of formulas, each of which is a logical axiom, a hypothesis that has been assumed for the derivation at hand, or follows from previous formulas via a rule of inference. The logical axioms consist of several axiom schemas of logically valid formulas; these encompass a significant amount of propositional logic. The rules of inference enable the manipulation of quantifiers. Typical Hilbert-style systems have a small number of rules of inference, along with several infinite schemas of logical axioms. It is common to have only <b>modus</b> <b>ponens</b> and universal generalization as rules of inference.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{collaborative}} filtering (CF) method that uses behavioral data provided as propositions having the RDF-compliant form of (user X, likes, item Y) triples. The method involves {{the application of}} a novel self-configuration technique for the generation of vector-space representations optimized from the information-theoretic perspective. The method, referred to as Holistic Probabilistic <b>Modus</b> Ponendo <b>Ponens</b> (HPMPP), enables reasoning about the likelihood of unknown facts. The proposed vector-space graph representation model is based on the probabilistic apparatus of quantum Information Retrieval and on the compatibility of all operators representing subjects, predicates, objects and facts. The dual graph-vector representation of the available propositional data enables the entropy-reducing transformation and supports the compositionality of mutually compatible representations. As shown in the experiments presented in the paper, the compositionality of the vector-space representations allows an HPMPP-based recommendation system to identify which of the unknown facts having the triple form (user X, likes, item Y) are the most likely to be true {{in a way that is}} both effective and, in contrast to methods proposed so far, fully automatic...|$|R
40|$|This study {{offers an}} {{analysis}} of independent conditional clauses (ICCs) that are used with argumentative functions in spoken Dutch. ICCs are used as arguments when they serve to motivate the speaker’s implied standpoint regarding a preceding propositional content, termed the trigger. Two basic types of argumentative ICCs can be distinguished, which are termed ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ arguments. Direct arguments express a contextually given premise {{on the basis of}} which a conclusion about the speaker’s standpoint regarding a preceding trigger can be drawn. Indirect arguments, by contrast, express a condition that – if it had held – would have warranted the conclusion, but its counterfactual interpretation resulting from hypothetical backshift signals that the speaker knows that this condition is not fulfilled, and hence that the implied standpoint regarding a trigger is not valid either. We argue that direct and indirect ICCs instantiate independent instances of epistemic non-predictive conditionals and hypothetical predictive conditionals (Dancygier 1993, 1998) respectively, and that they set up propositional-logic arguments of different classic forms, i. e. the <b>modus</b> ponendo <b>ponens</b> form (direct ICCs) and the denying the antecedent form (indirect ICCs). However, they do not explicitly express the conclusion of the argument, as they lack a main clause, but leave it to be inferred by the addressee. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{dominant}} {{topic of}} this study pertains {{to the relationship between}} the possession of properties on the part of linguistic items, such as words, concatenations of words or sentences, and the possibility of truly ascribing those properties to the concerned units. It can be verified that among the qualities which linguistic expressions can exhibit there are some which could be correctly attributed to them only by employing items which (numerically) differ from the pertinent expressions. As various properties exist which exhibit this particular feature the question how different phenomena of the impossibility of self-ascription are related to each other attains relevance. There is evidence to the effect that the existence of linguistic qualities exemplifying the pertinent peculiarity has been realized even in some non-Western philosophical tradition. For that reason the present investigation possesses both historical and problem-oriented ingredients. On the one hand the goal is pursued to substantiate the claim that the phenomenon of impossibility of self-ascription has been recognized in a non-Western tradition, at least with respect to particular linguistic properties. This task is performed by an analysis of a textual segment within a work which has been written in the tradition of linguistic philosophy in India, presumably in the fifth or sixth century AD, and by an attempt to demonstrate that a most coherent argumentative structure can be distilled from the textual segment supposing that it concerns the topic of impossibility of self-ascription with respect to semantic functions. On the other hand the question of how the impossibility of self-ascription regarding particular semantic functions is connected with problems of self-ascription regarding lack of truth constitutes a major concern of the study. It is contended that the latter phenomenon involves specific aspects and that accordingly the thesis insinuated by some scholars that the investigated text could provide a basis for the solution of truth-paradoxes is unwarranted. In {{view of the fact that}} the supposition that self-ascriptions of lack of truth always lack the property of expressing a truth is not self-evident it has been endeavoured to support the plausibility of this tenet and to show that this stance need not lead to inconsistencies, if it were assumed that only a particular type of content differing from a linguistically expressed content exhibits the qualities of being definitely true or untrue and of always complying with ‘classical’ inference-rules — in particular <b>modus</b> ponendo <b>ponens</b> and reductio ad absurdum — as well as with a principle according to which a linguistic unit expresses a truth exactly if its content is true. A contention is that the postulation of this type of content need not be made merely ad hoc. The envisaged position implies that the existence of indexical elements is by no means the only factor preventing that linguistic synonymy guarantees identity of truth value and that even linguistic items without deictic ingredients can be simultaneously linked to various types of content. As the investigations also refer to other phenomena suggesting that being simultaneously related to a multitude of contents is not an uncommon feature of linguistic expressions they touch on questions of interpretation and translation and thereby affect some general issues of the humanities...|$|R
25|$|This {{means that}} if a formula is {{deducible}} from the laws of intuitionistic logic, being derived from its axioms {{by way of the}} rule of <b>modus</b> <b>ponens,</b> then it will always have the value 1 in all Heyting algebras under any assignment of values to the formula's variables. However one can construct a Heyting algebra in which the value of Peirce's law is not always 1. Consider the 3-element algebra {0,½,1} as given above. If we assign ½ to P and 0 to Q, then the value of Peirce's law ((P→Q)→P)→P is ½. It follows that Peirce's law cannot be intuitionistically derived. See CurryHoward isomorphism for the general context of what this implies in type theory.|$|E

2500|$|The {{theory of}} {{inference}} (or 'consequences') was systematically developed in medieval times by logicians such as William of Ockham and Walter Burley. [...] It is uniquely medieval, {{though it has}} its origins in Aristotle's Topics and Boethius' De Syllogismis hypotheticis. [...] This is why many terms in logic are Latin. [...] For example, the rule that licenses the move from the implication 'if p then q' plus the assertion of its antecedent p, to the assertion of the consequent q is known as <b>modus</b> <b>ponens</b> (or 'mode of positing'). [...] Its Latin formulation is 'Posito antecedente ponitur consequens'. [...] The Latin formulations of many other rules such as 'ex falso quodlibet' (anything follows from a falsehood), 'reductio ad absurdum' (disproof by showing the consequence is absurd) also date from this period.|$|E

He preferred conjunction to either disjunction or the conditional, because conjunction has the least semantic ambiguity.
