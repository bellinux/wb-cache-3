The primary aim of <b>Montages</b> is to allow for specifications which can be produced and used during the various stages of the language life cycle. This paper describes an extension of <b>Montages</b> and its logical /algebraic characterization. The need for the extension occurred during full-scale case studies on Oberon, Java, and a domain specific language, that has been designed in industry. The tool support for <b>Montages</b> (Gem-Mex) has been completely re-implemented {{in order to support}} the new features and to generate an enhanced programming environment. 1 Introduction In this paper, we present an enhancement of <b>Montages</b> [22], a {{framework for}} the formal description of syntax and semantics of imperative programming languages.

5|$|The Degrassi opening {{sequence}} {{follows a}} two- to three-minute cold open. During {{the first five}} seasons these credits showed the characters on the school premises and followed a mini storyline. Seasons six and seven featured titles with the actors breaking the fourth wall and facing the camera, over a <b>montage</b> of character videos from past seasons, saturated with blue colour and gold outlines. The montages behind the characters depicting a major event in that character's storyline. For the eighth season, the show abandoned the style of titles used for the previous two seasons {{and returned to the}} original form of showing the characters at school while participating in school-related activities. Season thirteen dropped the opening credits, replacing it with an eleven-second <b>montage.</b> This continued into season fourteen. Instead of listing every ensemble actor, after the <b>montage,</b> season thirteen and fourteen episodes credit only the regular actors appearing in that episode.|$|E

5|$|Seventy {{minutes of}} footage, mostly {{dealing with the}} origin, were not {{included}} in the final cut. Much of this back-story was unscripted and the filmmakers were never sure of including it into the final cut, and had considered releasing some of these clips on the internet. Editor Kyle Cooper, creator of the Marvel logo (with the flipping pages) and the <b>montage</b> detailing Iron Man's biography in that film, edited together much of this footage into the opening credits. Leterrier explained a negative test screening, where flashbacks were placed across the film that the audience found too similar to Hulk, had resulted in compressing these to the film's start. This replaced the original opening, where Banner comes to the Arctic to commit suicide. When the scene ends, in an instant the frozen body of Captain America is partially seen in the ice. Leterrier said he did not want this scene to be lost amid the opening <b>montage.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Montages</b> are a semi-visual {{language}} specification formalism recently {{proposed by}} some of the authors. This framework has been successfully used to give complete executable specifications of languages like C and Java. This paper compares <b>Montages</b> with action equations, both being paradigms for incorporating a means for specifying dynamic semantics in an environment generator using an attribute grammar framework. The major differences between the two lie in the way they specify the semantic processing at the nodes of the abstract syntax tree and how they specify control flow. Action equations use equations, similar in spirit to the semantic equations in attribute grammars, while <b>Montages</b> make use of Abstract State Machine rules to specify the semantic processing. Control flow in <b>Montages</b> is represented as state-transitions in a finite state machine which is specified using a graphical notation, while action equations specify control flow by propagating events from one node of the syntax [...] ...|$|R

Rosenbaum also points out how the film influenced Warren Beatty's Reds. The film depicts the life of Jack Reed through the eyes of Louise Bryant, much as Kane's life is seen through the eyes of Thompson and the people who he interviews.
