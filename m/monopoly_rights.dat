5|$|The {{existence}} of the Kangchu was not recognised by the British colonial government, even though they exercised a similar degree of autonomy as their counterparts in Johor. Nevertheless, the Kangchu in Singapore had easy access to forested land in Singapore compared to their counterparts in Johor, as the British colonial government adopted a laissez-faire attitude to the Kangchu and imposed very little regulation on their agricultural activities. However, the British were wary {{of the fact that}} many Kangchu in Singapore were members of the Ngee Heng Kongsi, which was illegal in Singapore and enjoyed <b>monopoly</b> <b>rights</b> over the regional opium trade. The British appointed a Chinese official among the Kangchu to oversee the social and economic affairs of the gambier and pepper plantations in Singapore and to act as the intermediary.|$|E
5|$|Tudor's {{plan was}} to export ice as a luxury good to wealthy members of West Indies and the {{southern}} US states, where he hoped they would relish the product during their sweltering summers; conscious of the risk that others might follow suit, Tudor hoped to acquire local <b>monopoly</b> <b>rights</b> in his new markets {{in order to maintain}} high prices and profits. He started by attempting to establish a monopoly on the potential ice trade in the Caribbean and invested in a brigantine ship to transport ice bought from farmers around Boston. At the time, Tudor was regarded by the business community at best as something of an eccentric, and at worst a fool.|$|E

By 1879, the State of Louisiana had adopted a new {{constitution}} prohibiting the state's ability to grant slaughterhouse monopolies, devolving regulation of cattle slaughter to parishes and municipalities, and banning the subordinate governmental units from granting <b>monopoly</b> <b>rights</b> over such activities. Having essentially lost its monopoly protection, the Crescent City Co. sued. That case ended in Butchers' Union Co. v. Crescent City Co. (1884), with the Supreme Court holding that Crescent City Co. {{did not have a}} contract with the state and so that revocation of the monopoly privilege was not a violation of the Contract Clause.|$|E

40|$|The present article {{analyses}} {{the current}} state of international monetary policy and arrangements. The author first examines the nature of monetary arrangements guided by political institutions that are tempted to exploit the monetary system through the <b>monopoly</b> <b>right</b> to issue base money. The development of international institutions for controlling the <b>monopoly</b> <b>right,</b> the system of fixed exchange rates and the gold standard, and the eventual collapse of the Bretton Woods system are then reviewed. The recent development of the European Monetary System, its central issues and its prospects are then assessed. The author concludes that if the bureaucratic approach encouraged by the political process continues to disregard the one and only condition assuring a viable fix-rate system, that is sever constraints national monetary policies, the most likely outcome of the EMS will be a new series of speculative waves and an erratic monetary growth in the stronger currency areas with intermittent pressures on the stronger currency areas to accommodate the comparatively weaker area.

25|$|However, the 18th century saw the European empires {{gradually}} expand {{across the}} world, as European states developed economies built on maritime trade. The dynasty {{was confronted with}} newly developing concepts {{of the international system}} and state to state relations. European trading posts expanded into territorial control in nearby India and on the islands that are now Indonesia. The Qing response, successful for a time, was in 1756 to establish the Canton System, which restricted maritime trade to that city (modern-day Guangzhou) and gave monopoly trading rights to private Chinese merchants. The British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company had long before been granted similar <b>monopoly</b> <b>rights</b> by their governments.|$|E

The building faces Catherine Street (earlier named Bridges or Brydges Street) and backs onto Drury Lane. [...] The building is the most recent {{in a line of}} four theatres which were built at the same location, the earliest of which dated back to 1663, making it the oldest theatre site in London still in use. According to the author Peter Thomson, for its first two centuries, Drury Lane could [...] "reasonably have claimed to be London's leading theatre".

2500|$|The uitlanders {{resented the}} taxes levied by the Transvaal government, {{particularly}} when this money was not spent on Johannesburg or uitlander interests, but diverted to projects {{elsewhere in the}} Transvaal. For example, as the gold-bearing ore sloped away from the outcrop underground to the south, more and more blasting was necessary for extraction, and mines consumed vast quantities of explosives. A box of dynamite costing five pounds included five shillings tax. Not only was this tax perceived as exorbitant, but British interests were offended when President Paul Kruger gave <b>monopoly</b> <b>rights</b> for the manufacture of the explosive to a non-British branch of the Nobel company, which infuriated Britain.

[...] Accordingly, she departed Sydney Cove on 5 May 1788 and sailed north with the intention of purchasing furs in Kamchatka for resale in China.

Italian cities encouraged the start of a new pottery industry by offering tax relief, citizenship, <b>monopoly</b> <b>rights</b> and protection from outside imports. [...] Production scattered among small communes and, after the mid-15th century, at Faenza, Arezzo and Siena. Faenza, which gave its name to faience, was the only fair-sized city in which the ceramic industry became a major economic component. Bologna produced lead-glazed wares for export. [...] Orvieto and Deruta both produced maioliche in the 15th century. [...] In the 16th century, maiolica production was established at Castel Durante, Urbino, Gubbio and Pesaro. [...] Some maiolica was produced as far north as Padua, Venice and Turin and as far south as Palermo and Caltagirone in Sicily.

2500|$|A similar {{chartered}} company, the South Sea Company, {{was established}} in 1711 to trade in the Spanish South American colonies, but met with less success. The South Sea Company's <b>monopoly</b> <b>rights</b> were supposedly backed by the Treaty of Utrecht, signed in 1713 as a settlement following the War of Spanish Succession, which gave the United Kingdom an assiento to trade, and to sell slaves in the region for thirty years. In fact the Spanish remained hostile and let only one ship a year enter. Unaware of the problems, investors in the UK, enticed by company promoters' extravagant promises of profit, bought thousands of shares. By 1717, the South Sea Company was so wealthy (still having done no real business) that it assumed the public debt of the UK government. This accelerated the inflation of the share price further, as did the Royal Exchange and London Assurance Corporation Act 1719, which (possibly with the motive of protecting the South Sea Company from competition) prohibited the establishment of any companies without a Royal Charter. The share price rose so rapidly that people began buying shares merely in order to sell them at a higher price. By inflating demand this in turn led to higher share prices. The [...] "South Sea bubble" [...] was the first speculative bubble the country had seen, {{but by the end}} of 1720, the bubble had [...] "burst", and the share price sank from ¬£1000 to under ¬£100. As bankruptcies and recriminations ricocheted through government and high society, the mood against corporations, and errant directors, was bitter. Even in 1776, Adam Smith wrote in the Wealth of Nations that mass corporate activity could not match private entrepreneurship, because people in charge of [...] "other people's money" [...] would not exercise as much care as they would with their own.|$|E

50|$|It {{is common}} to draw a {{distinction}} {{in the treatment of}} authors and other interested parties between common law jurisdictions and civil law systems.

Both systems provide for a <b>monopoly</b> <b>right</b> granted to the author for a limited term which can be transferred to another person, which was initially the right to copy or otherwise reproduce the work (hence ‚Äúcopyright‚Äù) but has since been expanded to take account of technological developments.|$|R
