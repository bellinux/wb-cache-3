25|$|Montag awakens ill {{the next}} morning, with Mildred nagging {{him to get}} up and go to work. As Mildred tries to care for her husband (but finds herself more {{involved}} in the parlor wall entertainment in the next room), Montag suggests that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> should take a break from being a fireman after what happened last night. Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall family and angrily blames the old woman who killed herself over her books for Montag's change of heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: over the course of several decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.|$|E
25|$|The Undertaker {{then began}} a storyline where he teamed with Big Show in a tag team known as The Unholy Alliance, which held the WWF World Tag Team Championship twice. After their victory at SummerSlam, The Undertaker {{suffered}} a groin tear and was seen limping in several matches. He avoided competing in wrestling matches {{in the following}} weeks, instead tyrannically ordering Big Show to fight all his battles and oblige all his many wishes. He also began to transition away to the biker character he would play in 2000. Per an interview with Kevin Nash, this was a move to allow Calaway to enter World Championship Wrestling with a non-trademarked persona. Had he entered WCW, {{it would have been}} as Mark Calaway. Although negotiations were described as close, he ultimately re-signed with the World Wrestling Federation. To compensate for his lack of physical action, Undertaker became more vocal on the mic, often making smart-aleck remarks and providing commentary. In September 1999, on SmackDown!, Mr. McMahon threatened that he would remove Undertaker from the Unforgiven main event if he refused to participate in a casket match against Triple H. Undertaker retorted that he did not care and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> would not be participating in anything, thus walking out of the WWF. In reality, Calaway went on a hiatus from the WWF in order to treat his groin injury. On December 14 he made his return to action, teaming with Viscera in a losing effort against Kane and The Godfather at a house show in Caomo, Puetro Rico. The Undertaker was advertised on the Armageddon promotional poster to return, but meanwhile also tore his pectoral muscle, making him take almost eight months out of action.|$|E

Hašek commented, [...] "Maybe [...] was in the bathroom. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> was sleeping. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> doesn't know the rule." [...] The following season, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman announced that video replays {{would no longer be}} used to judge if players are in the crease or not, {{and that it would be}} a judgment call by the officiating crew. After the season ended, Hašek contemplated retirement because of a combination of injuries and a desire to become more involved in his family life. The announcement stunned many of his teammates, particularly Mike Peca and Jason Woolley.|$|E

500|$|Connor again {{returns for}} Angel:After the Fall. Brian Lynch was {{initially}} confused {{about how to}} incorporate Connor into the story. It was Whedon who hit upon the arc that Connor would follow in the series. He said, [...] "Connor's a young kid, he's got powers, he doesn't {{have any of the}} bad things, he's not a vampire, so <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> would enjoy it, and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> would be {{the closest thing to a}} superhero hell has". Well-adjusted now, Connor is shown [...] "fully embracing his qualities and role of a hero" [...] for the comic series. Originally Lynch had planned for Nina Ash to be more involved in his storyline, but with time it became clear to him that Connor's story is more about his relationship with Angel. So Nina fell to the wayside and Connor-Angel went on to become a much closer father-son unit. Connor also went from the character Lynch had the most trouble with to the character he enjoys writing most. Regarding Connor's upcoming role in Angel & Faith, Whedon joked about time-traveling him to the early 1960s and making him an ad executive, referencing Kartheiser 's recent role in the critically acclaimed television series Mad Men. Author Christos Gage describes the necessity of Connor's appearance with [...] "otherwise Angel is just a deadbeat Dad!" ...|$|E
500|$|Mills {{noted that}} consequentialism does not merely {{expect that the}} {{consequences}} to one entity is determined. It requires {{a review of the}} consequences to all. When Marty observes Judd's out-of-season shooting of a deer, he uses the incident to blackmail him to sell Shiloh to him. However, this places deer in the future in danger of Judd's hunting. Marty sadly reflects: [...] "By lettin' him get away with this, I'm putting other deer in danger. He kill this one out of season, he'll figure <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> can kill some more.

[...] Ringo Starr's reaction was more charitable: [...] "There's no doubt that the tune is similar but how many songs have been written with other melodies in mind?

She remarked that she watches C-SPAN every day. Although she identified herself as an unnamed entertainer, she was recognized by the C-SPAN host, who subsequently questioned her about her 1992 support for independent presidential candidate Ross Perot. She said, [...] "When I heard him talk right in the beginning, I thought that he would bring some sort of common-sense business approach and also less partisanship, but then...

[...] The actor recalls, [...] "I had no idea what that meant, until I read it!" [...] Adler had long wondered why his character behaved the way he did: [...] "I thought there's got to be a reason why he's so angry, why he's such a bully, why he's going {{out of his way to}} make other people's lives a living hell".

[...] They were married {{in the middle of}} the night of August 10, 1946 at Chestertown, Maryland after awakening a minister and roping in his wife and housekeeper to serve as witnesses. It was not until much later that Northrup discovered that Hubbard had never been divorced from his first wife, Margaret [...] "Polly" [...] Grubb; the marriage was bigamous. Ironically, the wedding took place only 30 miles from the town where Hubbard had married his first wife thirteen years previously. The wedding attracted criticism from L.

500|$|Maurice Richardson, of The Observer, {{considered}} the novel [...] "the usual sado-masochistic free-for-all, plus octopuses". The unnamed critic in The Manchester Guardian referred to Johnson's [...] "sex, snobbery and sadism" [...] complaint. They highlighted the [...] "sinister... cult of luxury {{for its own}} sake", with Bond's enjoyment of branded and bespoke products, but disagreed with part of Johnson's summary that the novel {{was a sign of}} moral decay; rather, [...] "we should be grateful to Mr. Fleming for providing a conveniently accessible safety-valve for the boiling sensibility of modern man." [...] This reviewer also conceded that while [...] "the casualties take place on a somewhat narrower front than usual, they are heavy". In April 1958, Fleming wrote to The Manchester Guardian in defence of his work, referring to both that paper's review of Dr. No and the article in The Twentieth Century. Fleming partly accepted the criticism concerning the exclusivity of Bond's objects, such as cigarettes and food, but defended it on the basis that [...] "I had to fit Bond out with some theatrical props". These included his cocktail, ("The Vesper") and Bond's diet. Fleming called these devices [...] "vulgar foibles" [...] which he was saddled with, although <b>maybe,</b> <b>he</b> suggested, [...] "Bond's luxury meals are simply saying 'no' to toad-in-the-hole and tele-bickies." ...|$|E
500|$|Star Treks creator, Gene Roddenberry, who wielded {{significant}} influence despite his ill health, hated the script. Meyer's {{first meeting with}} Roddenberry resulted in Meyer storming {{out of the room}} within five minutes. As with Meyer's previous Star Trek film (The Wrath of Khan), the script had strong military overtones, with a naval theme present throughout. Far from being idealized, the characters were shown as bigoted and flawed. In contrast to Roddenberry's vision of the future, Meyer thought {{there was no evidence that}} bigotry would disappear by the 23rd century. When Roddenberry protested about the villainization of Saavik, Meyer replied that [...] "I created Saavik. She was not Gene's. If he doesn't like what I plan on doing with her, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> should give back the money he's made off my films. Maybe then I'll care what he has to say." [...] After the stormy first meeting, a group including Meyer, Roddenberry, and producer Ralph Winter discussed the revised draft. Roddenberry would voice his disapproval of elements of the script line by line, and he and Meyer would square off about them while Winter took notes. Overall, the tone of the meeting was conciliatory, but the producers ultimately ignored many of Roddenberry's concerns. By February 13, 1991, the film was officially put into production with the agreement it would be in theaters by the end of the year.|$|E
