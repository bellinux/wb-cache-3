There is also an outline of {{the present state of}} soil acidity and acidity-related traits – contents of organic matter (OM), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in Slovene grassland. In grassland, soil acidification is an ongoing process under humid climate conditions. It is mainly driven by leaching of nutrients, net loss of cations due to retention in livestock products, use of physiologically acid fertilizers, acid rain and N 2 fixation. This process is reduced by strong pH buffering capacity of the soil and by physiologically basic fertilizers. Acid grassland soils in Slovenia are widely distributed {{in spite of the fact}} that 44 % of the total land has developed from a carbonate parent material. Of the 1713 grassland soil samples analysed during 2005 - 2007 45 % were regarded as acid ones (pH < 5. 5; in KCl), 57 % as soils with very low P status (˂ 6 mg P 2 O 5 / 100 g soil) and 22 % as soils with very low K status (˂ 10 mg K 2 O/ 100 soil). Increased content of soil organic matter was identified for alpine pastures (˃ 10 % OM in 44 % of samples), mainly as a result of low decomposition rate. Liming of acid grassland soils did not always reflect in a higher herbage yield. The cause for this inefficiency is plant composition of grassland. Thus, many grassland plants with relatively high production potential have adapted to acid soil conditions. To illustrate the inconsistent liming effect three researches are reviewed. In the first two researches liming along with fertilizer application did not increase the yield comparing to the fertilized control while in the third research the increase amounted 26 %. Liming improves considerably botanical composition of the acid grassland (e. g. sward where Common Bent – Agrostis tenuis Sibth. – prevails) and thus indirectly affects palatability and nutritive value of herbage. Grassland liming has a weak direct effect on herbage quality – it usually increases content of Ca and sometimes decreases Mg in herbage. The latter effect is rare. In Slovenia, ameliorative liming is advised for grassland soils with pH < 5. 0 and <b>maintenance</b> <b>liming</b> for grassland soils with pH < 6. 0 (pH in KCl or CaCl 2) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{imperative}} of the South African {{government is to}} increase agricultural production in rural areas. In support of this, a project was initiated in the Mlondozi district of Mpumalanga Province under the National LandCare programme. The goal was to assess land management practices contributing to sustainable and profitable agricultural production. Medium-term liming experiments were sampled {{to a range of}} lime treatments in a Hutton and Oakleaf soil. Critical thresholds where a reduction in relative grain yield was found were at a pH (H 2 O), extractable acidity, Al and acid saturation of 5. 49, 0. 277 cmolc kg soil- 1, 0. 145 cmolc kg soil- 1 and 13 %, respectively. Critical soil fertility threshold levels were established at 50 mg K kg- 1, 228 - 345 mg Ca kg- 1, 78 - 105 mg Mg kg- 1 and 1. 68 - 2. 83 mg Cu kg- 1. Nutrient vector analysis showed a toxic build-up of Fe, followed by Al {{and to a lesser extent}} Mn, which depressed the uptake of Ca, Mg and B in the Hutton soil. In the Oakleaf soil, Al toxicity, followed by high concentrations of Mn and Fe, markedly reduced the uptake of Ca, Mg and K by maize. Net rates of acid production in the soil profile varied between 1. 61 and 2. 44 kmol H+ ha- 1 year- 1 for the Hutton soil and between 4. 59 and 8. 82 kmol H+ ha- 1 year- 1 in the Oakleaf soil due to liming. A decline of 0. 046 pH unit year- 1 for an initial pH(H 2 O) value of 5. 33, and 0. 140 pH unit year- 1 for an intial pH(H 2 O) of 6. 47, respectively, in the Hutton was recorded. For the Oakleaf these declines were 0. 044 and 0. 110 pH unit year- 1, from pH(H 2 O) 4. 54 and 5. 15. <b>Maintenance</b> <b>liming</b> amounts at different pH values for the Hutton soil were equivalent to 0. 2, 0. 3 and 1. 4 tonnes CaCO 3 ha- 1 annually, while 0, 0. 8 and 0. 8 tonne CaCO 3 ha- 1 annually were recorded for the Oakleaf soil. The study was extended to 80 random topsoil samples in the district. Relationships of soil BC over limited pH ranges showed that at soil BC (pH organic C > clay. At soil BC (pH 4. 5 - 6. 5) the buffering mechanism was extractable Al > clay > CBD-Al > organic C > CBD-Fe. The main buffering mechanism between pH 6. 5 - 8. 5 was clay > CBD-Fe, organic C > CBD-Al. Acid production for 30 crop production sites varied from a measured 0. 21 to 10. 31 (mean 3. 70) kmol H+ ha- 1 year- 1 The rate of pH decline for the top 0 - 250 mm depth was between 0. 051 and 0. 918 (mean 0. 237) pH units year- 1. In the absence of remedial lime applications, pH (H 2 O) values in most of the area are projected to decrease to the critical value of 5. 68 or lower within 4 years. Soil with a pH (H 2 O) value of > 5. 73, extractable Al and acidity of < 0. 18 and < 0. 25 cmolc kg- 1 soil, respectively, clay content of ≤ 26 %, and a ECEC value of ≤ 3. 29 cmolc kg soil- 1, are at greater risk of acidification as gradual acceleration in soil acidification takes place at the above-mentioned critical thresholds.

From a methodological point of view, the Guidelines integrate, in one single process, the path of knowledge specific for the archeological stratigraphic analysis, the structural analysis and the evaluation of the state of conservation in relation to the life cycle of artifacts. The methodological path is articulated according to gradual models of in-depth analysis at territorial level (LV 1) or at a single artifacts scale (LV 2 -LV 3). The Guidelines describe a conservation process to be done through simple inspection activities (LIM 1) or through real inspections and programmed <b>maintenance</b> (<b>LIM</b> 2). The aim of this is to keep under control the decay processes at a suitable level with the safety of the building and with its usability, preventing interventions which do not compromise the integrity, the stratigraphic sequence of the artifacts and its understanding...|$|R
