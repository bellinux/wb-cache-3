40|$|In this article, {{we propose}} a {{probabilistic}} {{approach to the}} study of the characteristic polynomial of a random unitary matrix. We recover the <b>Mellin-Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> of such a random polynomial, first obtained by Keating and Snaith in [8] using a simple recursion formula, and from there we are able to obtain the joint law of its radial and angular parts in the complex plane. In particular, we show that the real and imaginary parts of the logarithm of the characteristic polynomial of a random unitary matrix can be represented in law as the sum of independent random variables. From such representations, the celebrated limit theorem obtained by Keating and Snaith in [8] is now obtained from the classical central limit theorems of probability theory, as well as some new estimates for the rate of convergence and law of the iterated logarithm-type results...|$|E

The system enables to recover precisely the user head position and orientation at predetermined viewing location {{without the support of}} markers. The tracking approach is novel and bases on the real-time registration of the live video-image with so called “reference images ” of the site. Once the matching between a live- and a reference-images could have been established, the virtual information can be presented correctly to the user, either using a 2 D image warping transformation or after deduction of the current 3 D position/orientation of the camera. The image matching algorithm re{{presents the}} core of the tracking system. It must have real-time performance and be particulary robust to intensity and local changes. We opted for an analysis in frequency space and exploit the invariance properties of the <b>Mellin-Fourier</b> <b>transform.</b> The tracking system has been tested outdoor {{in the context of the}} Archeoguide project. It runs on a laptop at around 10 to 15 Hz and provides views of virtual monuments in a Head Mounted Display superposed to the ruins of the archaeological site...|$|E
