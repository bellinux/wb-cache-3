5|$|In 1947, Marguerite Henry {{released}} the children's book <b>Misty</b> of Chincoteague, {{the first in}} a series of novels that made the Chincoteague breed internationally famous. The real <b>Misty</b> was foaled on Chincoteague Island in 1946, and was purchased as a weanling by Henry. In 1961, the publicity was increased even more when the film <b>Misty</b> was made, based on the book. The publicity generated by the books assisted the Chincoteague Fire Department and the breed in remaining viable into the 21st century. While fictionalized, the books were based on a real horse and ranch on Chincoteague Island, and the <b>Misty</b> of Chincoteague Foundation was established in 1990, to preserve the Beebe Ranch and establish a museum with memorabilia from the series. Model horse company Breyer Animal Creations has created models of <b>Misty</b> and five of her descendants. As of 2001, there were around 40 surviving descendants of <b>Misty</b> worldwide.|$|E

5000|$|The fourth novel, <b>Misty's</b> Twilight, was {{published}} after Henry's 90th birthday, and almost 30 {{years after the}} third. Kirkus Reviews observed that it was [...] "billed as fiction but more like a fictionalization concerning one of <b>Misty's</b> descendants". It concluded its contemporary review, [...] "this adult-centered narrative about an affluent doctor—whose troubles with her horse are always addressed by hiring yet another trainer—may be authentic, it will be of interest mostly to those who relish every crumb about <b>Misty's</b> family." ...|$|R

5|$|Eastwood's career {{reached a}} turning point in 1971. Before Irving Leonard died, he and Eastwood had {{discussed}} the idea of Malpaso producing Play <b>Misty</b> for Me, a film that was to give Eastwood the artistic control he desired, and his debut as a director. The script was about a jazz disc jockey named Dave (Eastwood), who has a casual affair with Evelyn (Jessica Walter), a listener who had been calling the radio station repeatedly at night, asking him to play her favorite song – Erroll Garner's <b>Misty.</b> When Dave ends their relationship, the unhinged Evelyn becomes a murderous stalker. Filming commenced in Monterey in September 1970 and included footage of that year's Monterey Jazz Festival. The film was highly acclaimed with critics, such as Jay Cocks in Time magazine, Andrew Sarris in the Village Voice, and Archer Winsten in the New York Post all praising the film, as well as Eastwood's directorial skills and performance. Walter was nominated for a Golden Globe Best Actress Award (Drama), for her performance in the film.|$|E
