2500|$|Using the Pole approach, {{we first}} {{localize}} the Pole or origin of planes. For this, we draw through point A on the <b>Mohr</b> <b>circle</b> a line inclined 10° with the horizontal, or, in other words, a line parallel to plane A where [...] acts. The Pole is where this line intersects the <b>Mohr</b> <b>circle</b> (Figure 9).

2500|$|The second {{approach}} {{involves the}} determination of a point on the <b>Mohr</b> <b>circle</b> called the pole or the origin of planes. Any straight line drawn from the pole will intersect the <b>Mohr</b> <b>circle</b> at a point that represents the state of stress on a plane inclined at the same orientation (parallel) in space as that line. Therefore, knowing the stress components [...] and [...] on any particular plane, one can draw a line parallel to that plane through the particular coordinates [...] and [...] on the <b>Mohr</b> <b>circle</b> and find the pole as the intersection of such line with the <b>Mohr</b> <b>circle.</b> As an example, let's assume we have a state of stress with stress components , , and , as shown on Figure 7. First, we can draw a line from point [...] parallel to the plane of action of , or, if we choose otherwise, a line from point [...] parallel to the plane of action of [...] The intersection {{of any of these}} two lines with the <b>Mohr</b> <b>circle</b> is the pole. Once the pole has been determined, to find the state of stress on a plane making an angle [...] with the vertical, or in other words a plane having its normal vector forming an angle [...] with the horizontal plane, then we can draw a line from the pole parallel to that plane (See Figure 7). The normal and shear stresses on that plane are then the coordinates of the point of intersection between the line and the <b>Mohr</b> <b>circle.</b>|$|E

This plane makes an angle of 63.435° with plane B, both in the Mohr-circle space and in the physical space.
