25|$|From its {{original}} development until the wide-scale adoption of natural gas, more than 50,000 <b>manufactured</b> <b>gas</b> plants {{were in existence}} in the United States alone. The process of manufacturing gas usually produced a number of by-products that contaminated the soil and groundwater {{in and around the}} manufacturing plant, so many former town gas plants are a serious environmental concern, and cleanup and remediation costs are often high. <b>Manufactured</b> <b>gas</b> plants (MGPs) were typically sited near or adjacent to waterways that were used to transport in coal and for the discharge of wastewater contaminated with tar, ammonia and/or drip oils, as well as outright waste tars and tar-water emulsions.|$|E

After quickly climbing the ladder of success in the <b>manufactured</b> <b>gas</b> and electric utility world, Doherty in 1910 created his own organization, Cities Service Company, to supply gas and electricity to small public utilities. He began by acquiring gas producing properties in the mid-continent and southwest.|$|E

25|$|These {{industrial}} concerns, {{especially the}} <b>manufactured</b> <b>gas</b> plants(MGPs) that produced gas for gaslight and power, steam and electricity, poisoned {{the air and}} bay waters, the soil and the surrounding communities for decades, leaving behind huge quantities of hydrocarbons, sulphur, acids, powdered carbon, ash, slag, manganese, mercury, lead, copper, cadmium, zinc and other heavy metals. The facilities and their outdoor coal and lampblack stores, tar and fuel oil tanks polluted vast areas of bay mud, artificial fill and {{millions of gallons of}} fresh and salt water. Constant dumping and dredging of polluted fill spread the problem to the entire Potrero shoreline while approximately two square miles of Potrero Hill was dynamited and dumped into the bay.|$|E
25|$|Gas never {{reproduced}} {{the dramatic}} success of 22 April 1915; however, {{it became a}} standard weapon which, combined with conventional artillery, was used to support most attacks in the later stages of the war. Gas was employed primarily on the Western Front—the static, confined trench system was ideal for achieving an effective concentration. Germany also made use of gas against Russia on the Eastern Front, where the lack of effective countermeasures resulted in deaths of over 56,000 Russians, while Britain experimented with gas in Palestine during the Second Battle of Gaza. Russia began manufacturing chlorine gas in 1916, with phosgene being produced later in the year. However, most of the <b>manufactured</b> <b>gas</b> was never used.|$|E

In France, Philippe le Bon {{patented}} a gas fire in 1799 and demonstrated street lighting in 1801. Other demonstrations followed in France and in the United States, but, it is generally recognized that the first commercial gas works was built by the London and Westminster Gas Light and Coke Company in Great Peter Street in 1812 laying wooden pipes to illuminate Westminster Bridge with gas lights on New Year's Eve in 1813. In 1816, Rembrandt Peale and four others established the Gas Light Company of Baltimore, the first <b>manufactured</b> <b>gas</b> company in America. In 1821, natural gas was being used commercially in Fredonia, New York. The first German gas works was built in Hannover in 1825 and by 1870 there were 340 gas works in Germany making town gas from coal, wood, peat and other materials.|$|E

2500|$|Despite its {{relatively}} short length, the Gowanus Canal was a hub for Brooklyn's maritime and commercial shipping activity. At its busiest, {{as many as}} 100 ships a day transported cargo through the canal. In addition, the industrial sector around the canal grew substantially over time to include stone and coal yards; flour mills; cement works, and <b>manufactured</b> <b>gas</b> plants; tanneries, factories for paint, ink, and soap; machine shops; chemical plants; and sulfur producers, all of which emitted substantial water and airborne pollutants. Chemical fertilizers were manufactured along the canal soon after the Civil War. Coal processing was a dominant industry along the Gowanus Canal since 1869. Coal plants along the upper canal used large amounts {{of water in the}} conversion of coal to coke, liquids and gases. Coal gas was soon used for heating, light, and factory power. Coke was used to make steel. Wastewater and coal tar (now known {{to be a source of}} carcinogens) were dumped back into the canal.

What brought about the end of <b>manufactured</b> <b>gas</b> was that pipelines began to be built to bring natural gas directly from the well to gas distribution systems. Natural gas was superior to the <b>manufactured</b> <b>gas</b> of that time, being cheaper - extracted from wells rather than manufactured in a gas-works - more user friendly - coming from the well requiring little, if any, purification - and safer - due to the lack of carbon monoxide in the distributed product. Upon being shut down, few former <b>manufactured</b> <b>gas</b> plant sites were brought to an acceptable level of environmental cleanliness to allow for their re-use, at least by contemporary standards. In fact, many were literally abandoned in place, with process wastes left in situ, and never adequately disposed of.|$|E
5000|$|As the wastes {{produced}} by former <b>manufactured</b> <b>gas</b> plants were persistent in nature, they often (as of 2009) still contaminate {{the site of}} former <b>manufactured</b> <b>gas</b> plants: the waste causing the most concern today is primarily coal tar (mixed long-chain aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, a byproduct of coal carbonization), while [...] "blue billy" [...] (a noxious byproduct of lime purification contaminated with cyanides) {{as well as other}} lime and coal tar residues are regarded as lesser, though significant environmental hazards. Some former <b>manufactured</b> <b>gas</b> plants are owned by gas utilities today, often in an effort to prevent contaminated land from falling into public use, and inadvertently causing the release of the wastes therein contained. Others have fallen into public use, and without proper reclamation, have caused - often severe - health hazards for their users.
