Therefore a study was carried out onthe melliferous potential of the species belonging to the Lamiaceae family from theDanube Valley. The effective area of study was represented by the Danube Valley inCălăraşi County. Within this study, the species belonging to the Mint genre wereidentified and their melliferous potential was established. A number of three species of mint (Mentha pulegium L., <b>Mentha</b> longifolia L.,Mentha <b>arvensis</b> L.) was identified, to which biometric measures were performed (asthe height of plant, number of flowering stems per plant, number of flowers perplant, number of plant per square meter) as well as melliferous determinations (asnectar secretion in mg per flower and the nectar concentration in sugar), and byusing a mathematical formula there were established the melliferous potential foreach identified mint species...|$|R

Nine species (M. piperita, M. suaveolens, M. canadensis, M. longiflora, M. aquatica, M. <b>arvensis,</b> <b>Mentha</b> x gracilis, M. gracilis and M. spicata) were propagated with five successive 30 -day subcultures in MS medium supplemented with NAA (0. 05 µM) and BAP (4. 4 µM). Shoots were rooted in MS with IBA, IAA or NAA (0. 0; 0. 25; 0. 5; 2. 5 or 5. 0 µM). The rooted plantlets were finally acclimatized in a greenhouse. Studied species increased in multiplication rates between 4. 2 and 9. 0 -fold per month. M. piperita, M. longiflora, M. arvensis, M. x gracilis and M. gracilis showed the greatest potential for plantlet production since the estimated production varied between 6, 000 and 27, 000 plantlets after five 30 -days subcultures. The addition of auxin to the medium did not influence root induction. However, IAA at a concentration of 5 µM provided the best results for root length and fresh weight, with averages 11. 1 cm and 0. 16 g, respectively.
