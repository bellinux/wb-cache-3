Local carpenter Samuel Bogardus did the framing with J.F Gerow handling the <b>masonry</b> <b>and</b> <b>bricklaying.</b> Shortly after it opened, the Civil War began. In 1861, the church thus entertained a visiting preacher, noted abolitionist Henry Ward Beecher, who told the congregation that liberty should be for all.|$|R

Designed in a plan similar to a split-level building, the school consists of three levels and contains departments in science, home economics, English, French, math, social studies, music, physical education, drama, child care center, and vocational studies which include technical drafting, business, introduction to vocations, agriculture, carpentry, graphics, electronics, <b>bricklaying,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>work</b> study programs of industrial cooperative training and distributive education. The building also includes administrative offices for the principal, assistant principal, secretary, guidance suite, visual air room, two first-aid rooms, and a conference room.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Education)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 1989. There {{is growing}} {{need for more}} {{technically}} skilled manpower in the Republic of South Africa. This implies, inter alia, that more pupils should be trained at school level in technical subjects such as Technical Drawing, Electrician Work, Radiotrician <b>Work,</b> Cabinetmaking, <b>Bricklaying</b> <b>and</b> <b>Masonry</b> <b>Work,</b> Plumbing <b>and</b> Sheet-metal Work, Motor Mechanics, Welding and Metalwork, Panel Beating, and Fitting and Turning. These subjects are taught at technical high schools, ordinary high schools, special secondary schools and schools of industry. In order to provide the necessary training in technical subjects to {{a growing number of}} pupils, a large corps of qualified technical teachers is needed. A shortage of qualified technical teachers has, however, developed over the years. This study has endeavoured to determine the causes for this shortage {{and at the same time}} to establish at which institutions in the RSA these teachers are trained, and what the entrance requirements and curricula are. Apart from studying the development and the practical application of the training of technical teachers in countries abroad such as England and Wales, Scotland, the Netherlands, West Germany, Israel and Taiwan, the corresponding historical development in the RSA was investigated and compared to the above. Particular attention was given to the entrance requirements and curricula used for the training of technical teachers. Five models for the training of technical teachers in the RSA were derived from this information...|$|R

40|$|In [5] B. Finel and M. C. Portmann {{studied a}} {{stochastic}} scheduling problem with resource constraints arising in {{iron and steel}} industry. They had to minimize an aggregate criterion which was a sum of <b>bricklaying</b> <b>work</b> costs <b>and</b> production loss. Simulations were used in order to schedule the moves <b>and</b> <b>works</b> of <b>bricklaying</b> systems. Modifications of the converter states were used in order to decrease the production loss, but only when a production loss was known in immediate future. We discuss here the possibility of decreasing the production costs by systematic maintenance policies assuming {{that the number of}} bricklaying systems is sufficiently large so that the production loss is not due to a bad schedule or a lack of these systems. We use stochastic control techniques and a Markov decision procedure called valueiteration algorithm in order to find the best policy (i. e. which minimizes the average production cost) for controlling each site containing several converters. This algorithm has [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Considering {{the amount}} of surveying, {{underground}} building, <b>and</b> <b>bricklaying</b> involved, a construction of this size could not be built all at once. Instead, the engineers divided the entire construction site into individual building areas. Through archaeological research, the boundaries of these building areas have been determined. For the Eifel aqueduct, they were each 15,000 Roman feet long (4,400 m or 2.7 miles in modern units). It has further been demonstrated that the surveying took place separately from the building, as {{is in fact the}} rule today in large construction projects.|$|R
