5000|$|For a few year {{close to}} 1880 a {{controversy}} raged round {{the composition and}} analysis of milk. James Alfred Wanklyn had stated that milk, apart from a considerable variation in the fat percentage, was of remarkably constant composition, the amount of [...] "solids-not-fat" [...] ranging from 9.0 to 9.3%. While this statement had never met with acceptance by continental chemists, public analysts had adopted Wanklyn’s figures and methods of <b>milk</b> <b>analysis.</b> The Wanklyn's procedure for the separation of fatty and non-fatty constituents was rather crude and yielded vastly varying results, as demonstrated in a celebrated milk case, heard in Manchester in 1885. Adams proposed a rather simple alternative: by merely distributing a weighed quantity of milk over strips of blotting paper and thus subdividing the solids over a very large surface, the direct extraction of the fat from milk became easy and complete. It has become the standard method by which all other methods of fat-estimation in milk were judged and regulated. The observation in itself was a small one, but it has affected fifty thousand milk analyses made annually in Britain.|$|E

40|$|Aim: Preterm {{nutritional}} audits {{have previously}} been conducted using assumed milk composition. We audited protein and energy intakes {{in the first}} 28 days of preterm life using both assumed milk composition and <b>milk</b> <b>analysis</b> to assess their effect on weight gain and {{to determine if the}} recommended reasonable range of intakes were met. Methods: Parenteral and enteral intakes and weight gain were recorded daily for infants (n = 63) born < 33 weeks gestation, using assumed milk composition. Macronutrient composition was determined by <b>milk</b> <b>analysis</b> for a subset of infants (n = 36). Linear mixed models analysis was used to assess the influence of energy and protein intakes on weight gain. Results: (Data median (range)) : Infants (n = 63) gestation and birth weight were 30 (24 – 32) weeks and 1400 (540 – 2580) g, respectively. Macronutrient milk composition was variable: protein 16. 6 (13. 4 – 27. 6) g/L, fat 46. 1 (35. 0 – 62. 4) g/L, lactose 68. 0 (50. 9 – 74. 8) g/L, energy 3074 (2631 – 3761) kJ/L. Intakes based on measured composition differed from assumed. Protein intake was significantly associated with weight gain. Compared to infants with longer gestations, those born < 28 weeks gestation were fed lower volumes, were more reliant on parenteral nutrition, took an additional seven days to transition to fortified feeds and median weight gain velocity took a fortnight longer to reach targets. Conclusion: Preterm milk composition is variable and routine fortification using assumed composition may result in inappropriate nutrition. Fortification regimens stratified by birth gestation may be necessary to achieve preterm nutrition and growth targets. <b>Milk</b> <b>analysis</b> is required for accurate nutritional audit...|$|E

We observed that the levels of more than 50 and 30 proteins were significantly increased upon growth in SMM and milk, respectively. The large redeployment of protein synthesis was essentially associated with an activation of pathways involved in the metabolism of nitrogenous compounds: peptidolytic and peptide transport systems, amino acid biosynthesis and interconversion, and de novo biosynthesis of purines.
