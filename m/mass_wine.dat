This coupled with an increased cultural interest in environmentally sustainable packaging has cultivated growing popularity with affluent wine consumers.|$|R
50|$|Seibel grapes are a {{group of}} wine grape {{varieties}} which originated {{with the work of}} Albert Seibel crossing European grape with American grape species to increase disease resistance. They were planted widely in France during the 1950s but have seen decline in recent years because French wine law proscribes hybrid grapes in appellation wine. The grapes are still commonly used as blending grapes in table <b>wine</b> and <b>mass</b> commercial <b>wines.</b> New Zealand, England, and Canada also have plantings of Seibel grapes.|$|R

50|$|There are {{relatively}} few independent wine producers in Japan, the industry being dominated by large beverage conglomerates such as Suntory, {{owner of the}} Snaraku, and Manns Wine brands, Sapporo trading with brands such as Chateau Lion, Delica, and Kirin through its Mercian Corporation operating subsidiary, owner of the Chateau Mercian label. All the major beverage conglomerates have access to domestically grown grapes, but given the challenge of climate on domestic grape production, {{three quarters of the}} wine bottled by Japanese producers relies to some extent on imported bulk wine or grape concentrate. Domestically produced <b>mass</b> market <b>wines</b> using imported wine or grape concentrate are required by law to note this on the label.|$|R
50|$|In 1722, six {{men were}} hired as “firewalkers” (Feuerläufer), {{although}} {{this did not}} mean, as both the German and English words do nowadays, people who walk barefoot across hot coals. These were firefighters of a kind, but of course without modern equipment. One among them was the fire captain. Whenever a fire broke out anywhere, they had to walk {{for up to three}} hours to reach the fire to help put it out. However, they could not leave the scene until they had been given a certificate witnessing their efforts. Each also had to take along his leather pail on the job. When they came back, they were to get from the municipality two <b>Maß</b> of <b>wine</b> and each was to get white bread for one Albus.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographyData on 14, 284 {{bottles of}} wine from six regions or countries, namely Argentina, Australia, Chile, California (United States), Burgundy (France) and South Africa, and from five vintages (1997, 1999, 2001, 2004 and 2005), are used to {{estimate}} a hedonic price model that causally relates wine prices to individual quality and country brands. A positive and statistically significant relationship between price and individual quality is confirmed, and {{it is found that}} the premium or penalty attaching to wines because of their associated country brand has held steady over time, as has price-quality elasticity. Individual quality being equal, Chilean and Argentine wines continue to suffer a penalty of over 50 % relative to Californian wines. Another finding is that the country brand problem will not be solved until countries that are newcomers to the industry, such as Chile and Argentina, succeed in producing a critical <b>mass</b> of <b>wines</b> of outstanding quality, for this is the factor that will ultimately determine whether their producers benefit from a good collective image or reputation...|$|R
40|$|Wine quality can be {{significantly}} impacted by tannin and polysaccharide composition, which can in turn {{be influenced by}} grape maturity and winemaking practices. This study explored the impact of three commercial wine additives, a maceration enzyme, an oenotannin and a mannoprotein, on the composition and sensory properties of red wine; in particular, in mimicking the mouthfeel associated with wines made from riper grapes. Shiraz grapes were harvested at 24 and 28 °Brix and the former vinified with commercial additives introduced either individually or in combination. Compositional analyses of finished wines included tannin and polysaccharide concentration, composition and size distribution by high performance liquid chromatography, while the sensory profiles of wines were assessed by descriptive analysis. As expected, wines made from riper grapes were naturally higher in tannin and mannoprotein than wines made from grapes harvested earlier. Enzyme addition resulted in a significantly higher concentration and average molecular <b>mass</b> of <b>wine</b> tannin, which increased wine astringency. Conversely, mannoprotein addition reduced tannin concentration and astringency. Addition of oenotannin did not meaningfully influence wine composition or sensory properties.

40|$|Beer {{is widely}} {{defined as the}} result of the brewing process, the outcome of fermenting grains, which over time has been refined and {{improved}} across the world. Together with wine, beer is the alcoholic beverage that has experienced the most significant expansion in terms of historical production, consumption and diffusion. Beer, however, presents more versatile and flexible characteristics compared to wine, for which the main ingredient — grape vines — requires a particular climate and subsoil to grow productively. For this reason and others, beer has become the drink of the <b>masses,</b> while <b>wine</b> has acquired the status of an elitist drink in many societies, notwithstanding price convergence between the two beverages, especially in recent times. As for spirits and liquors, the high alcoholic content associated with these beverages makes any combination with food and meals a challenging task, although this may not hold so true in some countries and regions, e. g. Russia and Eastern Europe. The consumption of beer, on the other hand, most frequently transcends consumers’ income, wealth, education or ethnic background — look at customers in any pub, inn or bar in the world. But why is beer so pervasive? What are the features of beer, bars and pubs that make them so special...|$|R
40|$|Anthocyanins are {{responsible}} for the colour of red grapes and wine. In addition to their contribution to the sensory properties of wine, these compounds are also of interest due to their beneficial biological properties. Wine anthocyanins exhibit a large structural diversity due to variations in glycosylation and acylation patterns, which is further exacerbated by the diverse reactions involving grape-derived anthocyanins during wine ageing. Chromatographic as well as mass spectrometric resolution of wine anthocyanins is often precluded due to the complexity of these compounds. In this paper we report a rapid, high-efficiency ultra high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) procedure with tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) detection for the in-depth screening of wine pigments. Selective detection of wine anthocyanins and derived pigments was achieved utilizing MS/MS in neutral loss scanning mode to observe the loss of dehydrated sugar moieties. This facilitated tentative compound identification based on molar mass information as well as the structured elution order of these compounds. In a second experiment, product ion spectra were recorded to allow identification of the anthocyanidin base using characteristic fragmentation patterns. The proposed methodology therefore involves two analyses for the sensitive and accurate identification of anthocyanins and their derived products in red <b>wines.</b> <b>Mass</b> spectra of <b>wine</b> anthocyanins under high energy collision induced dissociation (CID) conditions are reported, some for the first time. Significantly, chemical alteration of anthocyanins during wine ageing results in an off-set of the predominant fragments for each anthocyanidin base, whilst maintaining similar relative intensities. This allows unambiguous assignment of the derived products of anthocyanidin-glycosides. Using this approach, a total of 121 anthocyanins and derived compounds were identified in wines based on their relative reversed phase elution order as well as mass spectral information. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Amperometric biosensors; for the {{determination}} of glucose, fructose, ethanol, and glycerol were used to monitor alcoholic fermentation during red wine production in-industrial-scale plants. Platinum-based probes, covered with appropriate enzyme membranes, were assembled in electrochemical flow-injection analysis systems. Before use, the biosensors were validated in must and wine samples by spectrophotometric procedures. The biosensors; were applied during alcoholic fermentation in three wineries that used,different red winemaking techniques. Results are reported and compared. Glucose, fructose, ethanol, and glycerol content varied with different kinetics corresponding to three characteristic phases: an early phase with no detectable variation of the analytes, an intermediate phase characterized by rapid sugar use, and a late phase with little variation of the concentration levels. In particular, glucose was consumed more rapidly than fructose, confirming that the former is the preferential sugar source for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Experimental data demonstrated that the biosensors are useful tools for the close monitoring of alcoholic fermentation during industrial <b>mass</b> production of <b>wine.</b> [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} {{association}} between intake {{of different types of}} alcoholic drinks and mortality. DESIGN [...] Prospective population study with baseline assessment of alcohol intake, smoking habit, income, education, and body mass index, and 10 - 12 years' follow up of mortality. SETTING [...] Copenhagen city heart study, Denmark. SUBJECTS [...] 6051 men and 7234 women aged 30 - 70 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Number and time of cause-specific deaths from 1976 to 1988. RESULTS [...] The risk of dying steadily decreased with an increasing intake of wine [...] from a relative risk of 1. 00 for the subjects who never drank wine to 0. 51 (95 % confidence interval 0. 32 to 0. 81) for those who drank three to five glasses a day. Intake of neither beer nor spirits, however, was associated with reduced risk. For spirits intake the relative risk of dying increased from 1. 00 for those who never drank to 1. 34 (1. 05 to 1. 71) for those with an intake of three to five drinks a day. The effects of the three types of alcoholic drinks seemed to be independent of each other, and no significant interactions existed with sex, age, education, income, smoking, or body <b>mass</b> index. <b>Wine</b> drinking showed the same relation to risk of death from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease as to risk of death from all causes. CONCLUSION [...] Low to moderate intake of wine is associated with lower mortality from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease and other causes. Similar intake of spirits implied an increased risk, while beer drinking did not affect mortality...|$|R
2500|$|Although {{the style}} of making wine from dried grapes has been around {{almost as long as}} wine has been made, there are many {{theories}} on how the particular name Vin Santo or [...] "holy wine" [...] came to be associated with this style of wine in Italy. The most likely origin was the wine's historic use in the Catholic <b>Mass,</b> where sweet <b>wine</b> was often preferred. One of the earliest references to a [...] "vinsanto" [...] wine comes from the Renaissance era sales logs of Florentine wine merchants who widely marketed the strong, sweet wine in Rome and elsewhere. Eventually the term [...] "vinsanto" [...] became almost an umbrella name for this style of wine produced elsewhere in Italy. When the Greek island of Santorini came under rule of the Ottoman Empire, the ruling Turks encouraged the island's wine production of a sweet dessert wine made from dried grapes. Over the next few centuries, this wine became known as Vin Santo and was widely exported to Russia where it became a principal wine in the celebration of Mass for the Russian Orthodox Church.|$|R
5000|$|Findings {{of seeds}} {{dating back to}} the Iron (Stufels near Bressanone) and archaeological {{findings}} dating back to 400 BC witness that winegrowing was practised in South Tyrol already 3,000 years ago. Probably the earliest sources date back to before the Romans and to the wine produced by the Rhaetian. Marcus Porcius Cato in his De agricoltura highlighted the Rhaetian wine, before the territory was conquered by the Romans. The Romans learned by the Rhaetian how to store and transport wine in wooden barrels (according to Pliny). Especially Augustus and Tiberius (nicknamed “Biberius”) appreciated Rhaetian wine. In 720 AD, under the commissioner Corbinio, first bishop of Freising, vineyards landed in Burggrafenamt. From the twelfth century the monasteries in Southern Germany and the aristocrats incentive the winemaking. In the late Middle Ages and during the Asburgic monarchy the production of wine in the South Tyrolean wineries flourished. The wine production and sale developed thanks to the activity of the families of winemakers from the nineteenth century and thanks to the cooperatives since the twentieth century. In the twentieth century there were several critical periods: first due to the phylloxera and then in the First Post-war with the breakdown of the traditional markets (Austria, Hungary, Bayern) with the fascist repression, as well as during the Second Post-war. With the <b>mass</b> production, the <b>wine</b> industry consolidated until the 80s. In the 80s there was a deep crisis of the sales channels most common at the times, especially the sale of wine in tanks in Switzerland. Cellars changed their sales strategy. More quality wines were produced; quantity moved to the background and nowadays it hasn’t value any longer. Decisive for the wine making in South Tyrol was 1971, when people returned to the division and classification of wine zones according to the PDO rules. The quality production, pursued up until now since 20 years, as well as the spread of the bottling in bottles of 0,75 litres have earned this small wine area an excellent reputation. This is especially true for white wines in Italy, but also for the wine experts in the international markets.The South Tyrolean Wine Museum in Kaltern offers an overview of the history and the traditional grape cultivation methods in South Tyrol.|$|R
