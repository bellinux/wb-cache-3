40|$|Increased use of {{powerful}} PCR {{technology for the}} routine detection of pathogens has focused attention {{on the need for}} international validation and preparation of official non-commercial guidelines. Bacteria of epidemiological importance should be the prime focus, although a "validation infrastructure" once established could easily be adapted for PCR-based detection of viruses and parasites. The aim of standardization should be the widespread adoption of diagnostic PCR for routine pathogen testing. European experience provides the impetus for realization of this vision through preparation of quantitative reference DNA <b>material</b> <b>and</b> <b>reagents,</b> production of stringent protocols and tools for thermal cycler performance testing, uncomplicated sample preparation techniques, and extensive ring trials for assessment of the efficacy of selected matrix/pathogen detection protocols...|$|E

Then plate out only 10 – 20 µL bacterial suspension to the plate instead of all - Efficiency depends on ligation reaction and competent activity...|$|E
40|$|Many assays to {{evaluate}} the nature, breadth, and quality of antigen-specific T cell responses are currently applied in human medicine. In most cases, assay-related protocols are developed on an individual laboratory basis, resulting in {{a large number of}} different protocols being applied worldwide. Together with the inherent complexity of cellular assays, this leads to unnecessary limitations in the ability to compare results generated across institutions. Over the past few years a number of critical assay parameters have been identified which influence test performance irrespective of protocol, <b>material,</b> <b>and</b> <b>reagents</b> used. Describing these critical factors {{as an integral part of}} any published report will both facilitate the comparison of data generated across institutions and lead to improvements in the assays themselves. To this end, the Minimal Information About T Cell Assays (MIATA) project was initiated. The objective of MIATA is to achieve a broad consensus on which T cell assay parameters should be reported in scientific publications and to propose a mechanism for reporting these in a systematic manner. To add maximum value for the scientific community, a step-wise, open, and field-spanning approach has been taken to achieve technical precision, user-friendliness, adequate incorporation of concerns, and high acceptance among peers. Here, we describe the past, present, and future perspectives of the MIATA project. We suggest that the approach taken can be generically applied to projects in which a broad consensus has to be reached among scientists working in fragmented fields, such as immunology. An additional objective of this undertaking is to engage the broader scientific community to comment on MIATA and to become an active participant in the project...|$|E

In this work {{we describe the}} adaptation of a proprietary method for isolation of a specific umbilical cord tissue-derived population of MSCs, herein designated by its registered trademark as UCX®, towards the production of an advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP). Methods The adaptation focused on different stages of production, from cell isolation steps to cell culturing and cryopreservation. The origin <b>and</b> quality of <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>reagents</b> were considered <b>and</b> steps for avoiding microbiological and endotoxin contamination of the final cell product were implemented. Cell isolation efficiency, MSCs surface markers and genetic profiles, originating {{from the use of}} different medium supplements, were compared. The ATMP-compliant UCX® product was also cryopreserved avoiding the use of dimethyl sulfoxide, an added benefit for the use of these cells as an ATMP. Cells were analyzed for expansion capacity and longevity. The final cell product was further characterized by flow cytometry, differentiation potential, and tested for contaminants at various passages. Finally, genetic stability and immune properties were also analyzed. Results The isolation efficiency of UCX® was not affected by the introduction of clinical grade enzymes. Furthermore, isolation efficiencies and phenotype analyses revealed advantages in the use of human serum in cell culture as opposed to human platelet lysate. Initial decontamination of the tissue followed by the use of mycoplasma- <b>and</b> endotoxin-free <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>reagents</b> in cell isolation and subsequent culture, enabled the removal of antibiotics during cell expansion.
