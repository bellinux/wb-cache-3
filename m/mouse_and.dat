5|$|Critics {{thought the}} {{enhancements}} {{made to the}} gamepad control scheme were smart and welcomed additions like controls groups. However, in some cases reviewers still regarded the gamepad as a suboptimal control method, {{largely due to the}} nature of analog sticks being imprecise in comparison to a mouse. This led to some frustration among several writers as they were unable to avoid enemy attacks because maneuvering units was slow with a gamepad. While the <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> keyboard controls were seen as superior for performing precise actions quickly, some reviewers considered the control method to be unpolished and believed that concessions had been made for the gamepad. The unresponsive minimap, unintuitive default keybindings, and unfitting radial menus were highlighted as problems with the <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> keyboard controls.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE URB 937 is a {{peripherally}} restricted inhibitor of the anandamide-deactivating enzyme fatty-acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). Despite {{its limited}} access to the CNS, URB 937 produces marked antinociceptive effects in rodents. URB 937 is actively extruded from the CNS by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) membrane transporter, Abcg 2. Tissue Abcg 2 levels are markedly different between males and females, and this transporter is known to limit the access of xenobiotics to the fetoplacental unit in gestating female rodents. In the present study, we investigated the tissue distribution and antinociceptive properties of URB 937 in female <b>mice</b> <b>and</b> rats. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH We studied the systemic disposition of URB 937 in female <b>mice</b> <b>and</b> the antinociceptive effects of this compound in models of visceral (acetic acid-induced writhing) and inflammatory nociception (carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia) in female <b>mice</b> <b>and</b> rats. Furthermore, we evaluated the interaction of URB 937 with the blood-placenta barrier in gestating <b>mice</b> <b>and</b> rats. KEY RESULTS Abcg 2 restricted the access of URB 937 to the CNS of female <b>mice</b> <b>and</b> rats. Nevertheless, URB 937 produced {{a high degree of}} antinociception in female <b>mice</b> <b>and</b> rats in models of visceral and inflammatory pain. Moreover, the compound displayed a restricted access to placental and fetal tissues in pregnant <b>mice</b> <b>and</b> rats. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Peripheral FAAH blockade with URB 937 reduces nociception in female <b>mice</b> <b>and</b> rats, as previously shown for males of the same species. In female <b>mice</b> <b>and</b> rats, Abcg 2 limits the access of URB 937, not only to the CNS, but also to the fetoplacental unit. © 2012 The British Pharmacological Society...|$|R

5|$|Building on {{his late}} 1950s {{drawings}} of comic strips characters, Look Mickey marks Lichtenstein's first full employment of painterly techniques to reproduce almost faithful representations {{of pop culture}} and so satirize and comment upon the then developing process of mass production of visual imagery. In this, Lichtenstein pioneered a motif that became influential not only in 1960s pop art but continuing {{to the work of}} artists today. Lichtenstein borrows from a Donald Duck illustrated story book, showing Mickey <b>Mouse</b> <b>and</b> Donald Duck during a fishing mishap. However, he makes significant alterations to the original source, including modifying the color scheme and perspective, while seeming to make statements about himself.|$|E

5|$|In 1943 Lichtenstein {{left his}} study of {{painting}} and drawing at The Ohio State University {{to serve in the}} U.S. Army, where he remained until January 1946.
