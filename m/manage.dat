40|$|In {{order to}} assess the effect of {{clinical}} training and didactic instruction on medical student attitudes toward <b>managed</b> care, we conducted a survey of all medical students at the midpoint of their third year clerkships at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. The students were exposed to clinical training in <b>managed</b> care settings and a 2 -day required course on the principles underlying <b>managed</b> care. The main outcome measures were student attitudes toward the concepts of <b>managed</b> care, <b>managed</b> care organizations, and future careers in <b>managed</b> care. Students also assessed the attitudes of medical faculty toward <b>managed</b> care. Attitudes of students with previous clinical training in <b>managed</b> care settings {{did not differ from}} those of students without such exposure toward the concepts underlying <b>managed</b> care or <b>managed</b> care organizations and were less positive about careers in <b>managed</b> care. Student responses before and after the 2 -day course on <b>managed</b> care demonstrated that attitudes moved in a significantly positive direction. Seventy-one percent of students reported that the opinions they had heard from medical faculty about <b>managed</b> care were negative. Preparing medical students to practice medicine effectively in <b>managed</b> care settings will require focused attention on <b>managed</b> care issues in the medical school curriculum and the combined efforts of academic health centers and <b>managed</b> care organizations...|$|R
