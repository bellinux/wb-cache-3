40|$|The {{business}} cycle in the United States {{has changed in}} fundamental ways {{in the last three}} decades. Average labor productivity has gone from strongly procyclical to mildly countercyclical and labor <b>market</b> <b>recoveries</b> after the three most recent recessions have been weaker and more prolonged relative to earlier recessions. We consider the hypothesis that an increase in the importance of labor market mismatch during recessions can account for these changes. We build a model in which production takes place on two islands. Workers can costlessly move into and out of work within an island, but moving between islands requires passing through a longer period of unemployment. Aggregate shocks trigger relatively short-lived movements into and out of work within islands, whereas island-specific shocks lead to heightened mismatch and trigger reallocation across islands. Quantitatively, we show that a reduction in the importance of aggregate shocks—i. e. an increase in the relative importance of island-specific shocks which induce reallocation—can simultaneously account for lower output volatility, less procylical productivity, slower labor <b>market</b> <b>recoveries,</b> and behavior of labor market variables consistent with the {{business cycle}}s of the last thirty years...|$|R

The amount and proportion of the stake taken in any one bank was negotiated with the individual bank. Banks that took the rescue packages had restrictions on executive pay and dividends to existing shareholders, {{as well as a}} mandate to offer reasonable credit to homeowners and small businesses. The long-term government plan was to offset the cost of this program by receiving dividends from these shares, and in the long run, to sell the shares after a <b>market</b> <b>recovery.</b> This plan covered the possibility of underwriting new issues of shares by any participating bank.

The findings are drawn from relevant documents, marketing collateral and in-depth interviews with government agencies, professional associations and businesses.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{evolution}} of the labor market across the business cycle and specifically the relationship between the unemployment rate and the average duration of unemployment. Labor <b>market</b> <b>recoveries</b> have long been thought of as lagging recoveries in broad economic activity.

Using estimates from Markov Switching Models (MS) of the unemployment rate, average duration of unemployment, jobless claims and the exhaustion rate of regular unemployment insurance, this paper argues that this pattern {{is a result of the}} separation rate entering a recovery phase prior to the job finding rate...|$|R

Evidence spanning the entire postwar period suggests that job creation is at a historic low, and that its recent patterns are part of decades-long decline in the magnitude and volatility of job reallocation.

City planning policies are usually directed toward growth and new development, using tools such as comprehensive planning, zoning, subdivision regulations, and urban growth boundaries. Since {{the beginning of the}} 2008 Great Recession, there have been some policies and financial investment in Detroit’s infrastructure. The Neighborhood Stabilization Plan (NSP) was proposed by the Planning and Development Department of the City of Detroit, and builds off of Congress' Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The NSP aimed to address the impacts of foreclosure in communities that were detrimentally affected by the economic crisis, and hopes to support <b>market</b> <b>recovery</b> and stabilize neighborhoods. However, this policy has been largely ineffective due to city government delays, poor infrastructural planning, and misallocation of funds.|$|E

This reflects in part that, when unemployment is high, employers can find applicants with qualifications that closely match job openings.

During the Great Recession the unemployment rate began rising substantially, climbing to 10 % in the aftermath before falling slowly to slightly under 7 % in recent months. Debate about the main causes underlying this slow job <b>market</b> <b>recovery</b> has resulted in two very distinct views. One view {{is that many of}} the jobs created during the boom in real estate, construction, and finance were subsequently lost in the recession and will not come back as the economy recovers. As a consequence, much of the labor <b>market</b> <b>recovery</b> reflects workers changing careers.
