Many of the motifs are made with colors such as yellow, blue-green, rust and blue. Principle makers in Guanajuato city are Gorky Gonzalez, who maintains traditional designs, and the Alfarería Capelo Mayolica, which produces large pieces with more intense and darker colors.

40|$|Ceramics {{have been}} an object of trade since the Spanish first set foot ashore at the Caribbean in 1492.

5000|$|In the {{beginnings}} of his artistic career, Peter Keil's style was influenced by German expressionism. In the works from his early Berlin years, he mainly focused on typical big city settings and characters {{on the fringes of}} society.However, his style changed visibly {{at the beginning of the}} 60s when he lived in Paris for a while and emerged in the city's nightlife. Keil increasingly parted with his realistic approach and developed a new, much more spontaneous and dynamic painting style which he developed further during his years in London and finally during his time as one of the [...] "Berliner Neue Wilden" [...] at the beginning of the 80s. Since then, the use of intensive to lurid colours and the absence of realistic representation have become characteristic of his painting style. In his paintings, the colour is applied with quick brushstrokes and occasionally with impasto techniques and the images are additionally abstracted by the use of Graffiti elements. Keil prefers to paint human figures, portraits, big city scenes, landscapes and still life images of flowers. His emotional way of painting is mainly driven by a desire for freedom from social constraints and conventions. In the past 50 years, he has created numerous large- and small scale paintings in oil and mixed media on canvas but also some sculptures in wood and steel and a great number of <b>majolicas.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Majolica</b> pottery {{has been}} made in the state since colonial times after being {{introduced}} by the Spanish. Since then, areas have developed specialties in form and decoration, but techniques have not changed much for over 400 years. Most clay is extracted from the Dolores Hidalgo region and most is produced in Dolores Hidalgo, San Miguel de Allende and the city of Guanajuato. Another area noted for its work is Tarandacuaro, which makes high-fire ceramics. The two best-known workshops are Fabrica Javier Servin and Taller Checuan. The ceramics of this area have distinctive, very intricate, mostly geometric designs, which are painted on by hand. The municipality promotes the work through its Centro Turistico de Desarrollo de Tarandacuao.|$|E
25|$|A major {{producer}} {{outside of}} the capital is Alfarería Aguilera Mayolica Santa Rosa in Mineral de Santa Rosa, near Dolores Hidalgo. The designs of this workshop show indigenous influences, {{as well as some}} Italian and Chinese. Alfarería Aguilera is a family operation, run by several generations of the Aguilera family. Smaller workshops in this town produce both traditional and innovative designs for tableware, flower vases, and tile. One notable workshop is that of Juan Guerrero, who makes tableware with dramatic flowers of orange, yellow, and blue. Juan's father, Fortino, makes pottery with a plain reddish base and decorated with two tones of green glaze allowed to dribble down the sides. Some containers, such as flowerpots will have salamanders on the side. The making of <b>majolica</b> was introduced to Dolores Hidalgo by Father Miguel Hidalgo himself.|$|E
25|$|After the Spanish Invasion and Conquest, European {{techniques}} and designs were introduced, nearly wiping out the native traditions. Indigenous traditions {{survive in a}} few pottery items such as comals, {{and the addition of}} indigenous design elements into mostly European motifs. Today, ceramics are still produced from traditional items such as dishes, kitchen utensils to new items such as sculptures and folk art. Despite the fame of the prior, the bulk of ceramic items produced in the country are floor and wall tiles along with bathroom fixtures. Mexico has a number of well-known artisan ceramic traditions, most of which are in the center and south of the country. Examples are the Talavera of Puebla, the <b>majolica</b> of Guanajuato, the various wares of the Guadalajara area, and barro negro of Oaxaca. A more recent addition is the production of Mata Ortiz or Pakimé wares in Chihuahua. While the number of artisans has been dropping due to competition from mass-produced items, the production of folk art and fine ware still has {{an important role in the}} Mexican economy and the production of pottery in general is still important to Mexican culture.|$|E
40|$|Tese de doutoramento, História (História da Arte), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Letras, 2014 Caldas da Rainha assistiu, em pleno século XIX, ao surgir de uma cerâmica com intenções nitidamente artísticas, num estilo marcado pela decoração com elementos da flora e da fauna aplicados em relevo, associado ao conhecimento e à emulação de correntes estéticas internacionais, inspiradas nas <b>majólicas</b> italianas e nas faianças neopalissistas do século XVI. Credita-se a Manuel Mafra (1831 - 1905), ser o introdutor desta cerâmica artística sui generis em Caldas, vindo a desenvolver uma obra notável com assinalável êxito, nacional e, sobretudo, internacional, possibilitada pelo seu génio e habilidade, pela especificidade da região em que se desenvolveu, bem como pelo apreço e apoio que recebeu da Casa Real. Não obstante ser um oleiro oriundo de um meio rural, Manuel Mafra desenvolveu um percurso profissional notável, recebeu o honroso título de Fornecedor Real e viu a sua obra guindada aos mais elevados patamares, adquirida para ornamentar os espaços dos palácios reais, Necessidades, Pena, e Vila Viçosa. A sua obra foi largamente exportada para países estrangeiros, e premiada nas Grandes Exposições Internacionais, desde 1867, na Exposição de Paris, com continuidade nos certames seguintes. A absorção de correntes estéticas internacionais por Manuel Mafra, e a sua coexistência com a tradição, marca esta produção, cuja identidade/alteridade se encontra ainda por analisar e fundamentar, quanto às suas origens e caracterização, constituindo um desafio tão difícil como irresistível. Conhecer a obra de Mafra, pressupõe a análise de outras obras cerâmicas, que embora afastadas temporalmente, convergem numa questão central, a ligação estilística entre a longínqua obra do autor francês do Renascimento, Bernard Palissy, o seu renascer na cerâmica naturalista /revivalista francesa e inglesa do século XIX, e a sua recepção e radicação em Portugal, na cerâmica caldense. Esta cerâmica, e a aceitação de que foi alvo, levantam questões fulcrais, como a análise da iconografia que a percorre, as fontes onde se inspira e, também, como reflexo do imaginário de uma sociedade, e do seu gosto. Permite desvendar, através da observação do seu gosto artístico, a mentalidade de uma elite portuguesa do século XIX, que, antes de se deleitar com as sossegadas e palpáveis paisagens das telas de Malhoa e com as naturezas vivas/mortas em louça de Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro, se deixa fascinar, adquirindo as peças românticas e perturbadoras de um ceramista como Manuel Mafra. Obra muito apreciada, mas também alvo de fortes críticas por estudiosos portugueses, como Joaquim de Vasconcelos, defensor dos valores mais intrínsecos da arte portuguesa para os produtos da indústria, e rejeitando as imitações de modelos estrangeiros e antiquados. A obra de Mafra, se por um lado explica as origens da cerâmica artística caldense, por outro, traduz e permite perceber o conflito vivido na altura entre o implantar da industrialização e as questões levantadas por movimentos e autores que, seguindo directrizes inovadoras do Arts and Crafts e Aesthetic Movement, clamam pelo estudo do desenho, uso de um bom design e a aplicação das artes às indústrias que vão prevalecer nas relações manufactura/ indústria e arte da época, e culminar em expressões de modernidade como a Arte Nova e Art Déco. Caldas da Rainha {{in the mid}} nineteenth-century saw the {{emergence}} of a distinctive ceramic ware, intentionally embodied in artistic features, a style clearly marked by decorative elements of flora and fauna applied in high-relief, associated with knowledge and emulation of foreign aesthetic trends, inspired in the Italian <b>majolicas</b> and sixteenth-century neo-Palissy faiences. Manuel Mafra (1831 - 1905) is credited introducing this sui generis style in Caldas, creating an amazing amount of wares with enormous success, both at home and more remarkably abroad. This was made possible because of his talent and skill, combined with the region’s structural peculiarities, and the esteem and support he gained from the Royal House. Though born a potter in a rural environment, Manuel Mafra undertook a remarkable professional course, was granted the honorable title of Royal Supplier, saw his production reach the highest levels of acceptance, and acquired to ornament spaces in royal palaces, such as those of Necessidades, Pena and Vila Viçosa. His production was largely exported to foreign countries, and awarded relevant prizes in The Great International Expositions, beginning in 1867 in Paris, and in the succeeding exhibitions. Manuel Mafra’s absorption of foreign aesthetic styles, coexistence with tradition, marked his production, identity and alterity which are still to be fully analysed and substantiated with regard to origins and characterisation, as difficult as irresistible a challenge it may be. Getting to know Mafra’s artwork presupposes the comparative analysis of other ceramic productions which, though far apart in time, converge into a central question, that is the stylistic relationship between the distant work authored by French Renaissance artist, Bernard Palissy, its rebirth in the naturalist/revivalist French and English ceramic in the nineteenth century, together with its acceptance and putting down roots in Portugal by embodying Caldas’ ceramic. This ceramic ware and the acceptance it received raises central question issues, such as the iconography running through it, its inspiration sources, also as the imaginary of a society and its taste, permitting through the observation of its artistic taste the revelation of the nineteenth-century Portuguese elite mentality. A society that before indulging in the quiet and discernible sceneries of Malhoa’s canvas or Rafael Bodalo Pinheiro’s works embodying moving life/still life, falls fascinated by and buys romantic and perturbing artwork authored by a ceramist like Manuel Mafra. Works highly appreciated, but also strongly criticized by Portuguese scholars, such as Joaquim de Vasconcelos a defender of intrinsic values of Portuguese art in industrial products, rejecting perceived imitations of outmoded and foreign models. Mafra’s production, if on the one hand explains the origins of Caldas’ artistic ceramic, on the other hand translates and permits the understanding of the conflict between the implementation of industrialization and the questions arisen by movements and authors pursuing innovative directives of the Arts and Crafts e Aesthetic Movement, claiming for the study of drawing, the use of good design and the application of the arts in the industries that will prevail in the relation manufacture/industry and art at the time, culminating in modernity expressions like Art Nouveau and Art Déco.

40|$|The University of Texas at San Antonio Center for Archaeological Research (UTSA-CAR) {{contracted}} with Adams Environmental, Inc. to provide archaeological services to Capital Improvement Management (CIMS) of the City of San Antonio (COSA) {{related to the}} archaeological investigation of selected areas of San Pedro Springs Park in San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas. The CAR conducted archaeological testing at this National Register Site, 41 BX 19, from early December 2013 to mid-January of 2014. The goals of archaeological investigations were to identify and investigate any proto-historic and historic archaeological deposits associated with Colonial Period occupants of the area, including evidence of the first acequia and associated dam, {{and the location of}} the first presidio and villa. In addition, CAR was tasked with the investigation of any prehistoric cultural deposits encountered. This project was performed by staff archaeologists from the CAR. It was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6727, with Dr. Steve Tomka serving as Principal Investigator (PI), and Kristi Nichols and Stephen Smith serving as Project Archaeologists. Dr. Tomka departed from UTSA shortly after the completion of fieldwork. At that time, Dr. Raymond Mauldin of CAR assumed PI responsibilities for the project. One hundred and eleven shovel tests, eleven 1 -x- 1 m test units, two 50 -x- 50 cm units, two backhoe trenches, and several auger holes were excavated during this effort. Minimal artifactual evidence of colonial occupants was noted during the archaeological investigations. Several Native American bone tempered sherds that could reflect either Late Prehistoric Leon Plain or Goliad ware were recovered. However, no Spanish <b>Majolicas</b> or lead glazed wares were uncovered, and no gunflints were identified in the lithic assemblage. Due to various utility lines and other obstructions, backhoe trenches to search for the acequia and associated dam could not be excavated. It is likely that areas proposed for investigation of the acequia and associated dam have been disturbed by aforementioned utility lines as well as earlier construction within the park. No evidence of the specific location of the first presidio or villa was located. Shovel testing and test units revealed the presence of historic and prehistoric use of the park, though mixing of historic and prehistoric material, as well as other disturbances (e. g., rodents), was common in the deposits. However, there was an increase in prehistoric material with depth as revealed in shovel testing results. Shovel testing located Feature 1, a burned rock feature that possibly was associated with a sheet midden, as well as several areas with high densities of prehistoric materials. Test excavations, based on these shovel tests, suggest that Feature 1 is a discrete feature that lies below a widespread, low-density distribution of burned rock. Shovel testing also identified a high-density cluster of lithic, bone, and burned rock. The excavation of a 1 -x- 1 m test unit (TU 4) in this area produced over 4, 000 pieces of debitage, with over 50 % of this total coming from three levels. Burned rock, a variety of tools, faunal material, and charcoal were present throughout these levels. Temporal placement of deposits relied on artifact typologies (e. g., ceramic types, lithic projectile points, lithic tool types) as well as two charcoal and four bone collagen radiocarbon dates. Artifact typologies suggest occupation as early as the Early Archaic as reflected by a possible Guadalupe tool. A series of Late Archaic Points (Castroville, Frio, Marcos, and Montell) and Late Prehistoric point forms (Edwards, Perdiz, and Scallorn) are present from several areas. In addition, a possible Middle Archaic La Jita point was recovered. The bone tempered Native American wares could date as early as AD 1250, though they could also reflect proto-historic or colonial age materials. Other ceramics primarily suggest a mid-nineteenth- to midtwentieth- century occupation. Using the midpoints of the 1 -sigma distribution, calibrated radiocarbon dates show use of San Pedro Park from as early as 100 AD (CAR 345; 1905 +/- 22 Radiocarbon Years Before Present [RCYBP]) to as recently as the early twentieth century. The more recent end of that range is a function of two late dates from two different areas of the park. The first of these is on a bison bone (CAR 344) that returned a date of 158 +/- 23 RCYBP. The second is on a bone consistent with a bison-sized animal (CAR 346) that produced a date of 155 +/- 23 RCYBP. The corrected, calibrated dates for these two samples range from AD 1670 to the early 1940 s using the 1 -sigma spread. The wide range of these dates is related to the flat calibration curve late in time. However, the most probable date range (ca. 36 % probability) for these two dates is between AD 1729 and 1779, with a roughly 48 % probability that they date prior to AD 1779. Limited testing suggests that, with a few specific exceptions, the upper 30 - 40 cm of San Pedro Park is extensively disturbed. However, though some disturbances are present, at least three areas have materials in what appears to be good context. These include material dating to the Late Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and possibly the Proto-historic or Colonial Period. Based on historic maps, previous work, and the current investigation, CAR proposes a series of management areas for San Pedro Park. If work in these management areas follows these suggestions for various limits on subsurface impacts, CAR recommends that renovation activities within the park be allowed to proceed. The Texas Historical Commission (THC), in a letter dated February 4, 2015, agreed with these recommendations. Finally, CAR provides several recommendations for public education facilities within the park. In accordance with the THC Permit specifications and the Scope of Work for this project, all field notes, analytical notes, photographs, and other project related documents, along with a copy of the final report, will be curated at the CAR. After quantification and completion of analysis, and in consultation with THC and the COSA Office of Historic Preservation, artifacts possessing little scientific value were discarded pursuant to Chapter 26. 27 (g) (2) of the Antiquities Code of Texas. Artifact classes discarded specific to this project included samples of burned rock and snail shell, all unidentifiable metal, soil samples, and recent (post- 1950) material...|$|R
25|$|Near {{the end of}} {{the colonial}} period, another member of the clergy was active in {{promoting}} the crafts as way to help those in lower social positions in Mexico. In 1803, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla settled in as the parish priest of Dolores, Guanajuato. Turning over most of his religious duties to a vicar, Hidalgo dedicated himself to commerce, intellectual pursuits and humanitarian activity. He spent much of his time studying literature, scientific works, grape cultivation, the raising of silkworms. He used the knowledge that he gained to promote economic activities for the poor and rural people in his area. He established factories to make bricks and pottery and trained indigenous people in the working of leather. He also promoted beekeeping. He was interested in promoting activities of commercial value to use the natural resources of the area to help the poor. His goal was to make the Indians and mestizos more self-reliant. However, these activities violated policies designed to protect Spanish peninsular agriculture and industry, and Hidalgo was ordered to stop them. The Spanish authority’s treatment of peasants and the lower classes would be one factor in pushing Hidalgo to begin the Mexican War of Independence with his famous Grito de Dolores. Hidalgo’s efforts founded the <b>Majolica</b> pottery industry in Guanajuato state.|$|E

2500|$|Talavera pottery of Puebla, Mexico {{is a type}} of <b>majolica</b> ceramic, {{which is}} {{distinguished}} by a milky-white glaze. [...] Authentic Talavera pottery only comes from the city of Puebla and the nearby communities of Atlixco, Cholula, and Tecali, because {{of the quality of the}} natural clay found there and a tradition of production that dates to the 16th century.|$|E
2500|$|Handcrafts in Mexico {{vary widely}} from {{materials}} used, techniques and employ and styles preferred. The most prevalent of Mexico’s crafts is ceramics/pottery. Ceramics was {{considered one of}} the highest art forms during the Aztec Empire, with [...] the knowledge of making pottery said to have come from the god Quetzalcoatl himself. Pre-Hispanic pottery was made by coiling the clay into a circle then up the sides, then scraping and molding the coiled work until the coils could no longer be detected. The Spanish introduced the potters’ wheel and new glazing techniques. <b>Majolica</b> glazed pottery was introduced by the Spanish. Puebla in particular is renowned for its variety of <b>Majolica,</b> which is called Talavera. One distinctive feature of this city is that many kitchens and buildings are decorated with intricately detailed Talavera tiles. Tiles are a subset of ceramic pottery and were used extensively in colonial-era Mexico. These tiles were first fired at a low temperature, then hand-painted with intricate designs, then fired at a high temperature to set the glaze. These are still made, but most decorative tiles used in Mexico are factory-made. Unglazed pottery is still made, but generally it is for decorative purposes only, and copies the designs of pre-Hispanic cultures.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{the pool}} {{was one of}} the highest indoor pools in the world, and its fourteenth-floor {{location}} was heralded as a grand feat of engineering. [...] Today it is commonly referred to as the Johnny Weissmuller pool, after the famous Olympic athlete and actor who trained in it. The rows of seats which remain on its western wall recall the days when swimming was a popular spectator sport. [...] Its blue Spanish <b>majolica</b> tiles and terra-cotta fountain of Neptune on its east wall remain virtually unchanged today.|$|E
2500|$|One common way to {{decorate}} the simplest of ceramic pieces in Oaxaca is called [...] "chorreada" [...] (runny). The pieces are first fired with a clear glaze. Then a second glaze with oxides for color are dabbed on and allowed to run where it may. This double glazing {{is similar to the}} production of 19th century <b>Majolica,</b> a pottery form more prominent in central Mexico. [...] The use of raised images on clay items has also been adapted to more traditional vessels, often with the image colored differently from the background.|$|E
2500|$|Tin-glazed pottery of {{different}} periods and styles is known by different names. [...] The pottery from Muslim Spain {{is known as}} Hispano-Moresque ware. The decorated tin-glaze of Renaissance Italy is called maiolica, sometimes pronounced <b>majolica</b> by English speakers. [...] When the technique was taken up in the Netherlands it became known as delftware {{as much of it}} was made in the town of Delft. [...] Dutch potters brought it to England in around 1600 and wares produced there are known as English delftware or galleyware. [...] In France it was known as faience.|$|E
2500|$|European style ware, {{especially}} glazed ware, {{produced by}} native craftsmen, began {{early in the}} colonial period but was poorly done with only two colors, green and amber. Most decorative elements were stamped on with mixed Spanish and indigenous designs. The most common forms were jugs, pitchers and bowls, all for everyday use. Over time, the production of <b>majolica</b> glazed ware, which was expensive to import from Europe, developed and regulated by the mid-17th century. The best was being produced in Puebla, although it was being also produced in Mexico City, Guadalajara, Aguascalientes and other places. These pieces were primarily had a white or cream colored background with designs painted on them {{in one or more}} colors. [...] For the rest of the colonial period, indigenous styles continued to deteriorate all over New Spain, while foreign influences from Europe, Asia and the Middle East produced changes in decorations. [...] By the time of the Mexican War of Independence, Mexican <b>majolica</b> was exported throughout the New World and drove the Spanish version from the market. However, this dominance would not last long before cheaper Delftware from England and Asian wares put pressure on the industry in the 19th century. Mexico continued to import and copy styles from France and England through the 20th century; however, there have been native innovations during the past century and a half as well.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the support}} and {{interest}} in traditional Mexican ceramics, the number of artisans is dropping. In 1994, there were just over 1.5 million ceramic artisans in the country, which dropped to 50,000 by 2006. This made craftsmen almost non-existent in some states. <b>Majolica</b> is no longer being produced in Aguascalientes {{and the number of}} workshops in Guanajuato state has been cut in half in recent years. [...] In major cities such as Mexico City and Monterrey, there is only a handful. One {{reason for this is that}} many craft products are being replaced by cheaper pewter and plastic wares. Another reason is that many from craft producing areas have left to work in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Another popular ware both to {{make and}} to adorn the houses are round suns with spiky halos with smiling or {{surprised}} faces. These are sold both painted and unpainted. The workshop of Saul Camacho makes <b>majolica</b> similar to the Talavera of Puebla and Manuel León Montes de Oca, makes copies of pre-Hispanic pieces. These pieces are valued because the artisan {{took the time to}} study the forms and cultures of the originals. Metepec also makes pottery for everyday use, generally of the natural clay color with simple geometric designs done in white slip. One of the more unusual pieces of this type are pitcher and cup set designed for the drinking of pulque. These often carry interesting slogans such as [...] "I am yours" [...] or [...] "Long Live Pulque" [...] or [...] "Let him who drains me, fill me." [...] They can also be distinguished by having animal or people heads (bull, goat, man with cigar and others) with the pulque coming out of the mouth. Many of these are made by Lázaro León.|$|E
