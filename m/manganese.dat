5|$|A more {{progressive}} extraction process involves directly reducing <b>manganese</b> ore {{in a heap}} leach. This is done by percolating natural gas through {{the bottom of the}} heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the <b>manganese</b> ore to <b>manganese</b> oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the <b>manganese</b> dioxide to form iron hydroxide and elemental <b>manganese.</b> This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the <b>manganese.</b> For further purification, the <b>manganese</b> can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.|$|E
5|$|A protein called DMT1 is {{the major}} {{transporter}} in <b>manganese</b> absorption from the intestine, and may be the major transporter of <b>manganese</b> across the blood–brain barrier. DMT1 also transports inhaled <b>manganese</b> across the nasal epithelium. The proposed mechanism for <b>manganese</b> toxicity is that dysregulation leads to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate-mediated excitoxicity, and aggregation of proteins.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{experiments}} {{have given the}} opportunity to examine the consequences of <b>manganese</b> overexposure under controlled conditions. In (non-aggressive) rats, <b>manganese</b> induces mouse-killing behavior.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{was used}} in glassmaking, <b>manganese</b> dioxide was {{available}} for experiments by alchemists, the first chemists. Ignatius Gottfried Kaim (1770) and Johann Glauber (17th century) discovered that <b>manganese</b> dioxide could be converted to permanganate, a useful laboratory reagent. By the mid-18th century, the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele used <b>manganese</b> dioxide to produce chlorine. First, hydrochloric acid, or a mixture of dilute sulfuric acid and sodium chloride was made to react with <b>manganese</b> dioxide, later hydrochloric acid from the Leblanc process was used and the <b>manganese</b> dioxide was recycled by the Weldon process. The production of chlorine and hypochlorite bleaching agents was a large consumer of <b>manganese</b> ores.|$|E
5|$|For the {{production}} of ferromanganese, the <b>manganese</b> ore is mixed with iron ore and carbon, and then reduced either in a blast furnace or in an electric arc furnace. The resulting ferromanganese has a <b>manganese</b> content of 30 to 80%. Pure <b>manganese</b> used for {{the production}} of iron-free alloys is produced by leaching <b>manganese</b> ore with sulfuric acid and a subsequent electrowinning process.|$|E
5|$|<b>Manganese</b> {{compounds}} {{have been}} used as pigments and for the coloring of ceramics and glass. The brown color of ceramic is sometimes the result of <b>manganese</b> compounds. In the glass industry, <b>manganese</b> compounds are used for two effects. Manganese(III) reacts with iron(II) to induce a strong green color in glass by forming less-colored iron(III) and slightly pink manganese(II), compensating for the residual color of the iron(III). Larger quantities of <b>manganese</b> are used to produce pink colored glass.|$|E
5|$|<b>Manganese</b> {{comprises}} about 1000ppm(0.1%) of the Earth's crust, the 12th {{most abundant}} of the crust's elements. Soil contains 7–9000ppm of <b>manganese</b> {{with an average}} of 440ppm. Seawater has only 10ppm <b>manganese</b> and the atmosphere contains 0.01µg/m3. <b>Manganese</b> occurs principally as pyrolusite (MnO2), braunite, (Mn2+Mn3+6)(SiO12), psilomelane (Ba,H2O)2Mn5O10, {{and to a lesser extent}} as rhodochrosite (MnCO3).|$|E
5|$|<b>Manganese</b> {{exposure}} in United States is {{regulated by the}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). People can be exposed to <b>manganese</b> in the workplace by breathing it in or swallowing it. OSHA has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for <b>manganese</b> {{exposure in}} the workplace as 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 3mg/m3. At levels of 500mg/m3, <b>manganese</b> is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|<b>Manganese</b> has no {{satisfactory}} substitute in {{its major}} applications in metallurgy. In minor applications, (e.g., <b>manganese</b> phosphating), zinc and sometimes vanadium are viable substitutes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Manganese</b> is a silvery-gray {{metal that}} resembles iron. It is hard and very brittle, {{difficult}} to fuse, but easy to oxidize. <b>Manganese</b> metal and its common ions are paramagnetic. <b>Manganese</b> tarnishes slowly in air and oxidizes ("rusts") like iron in water containing dissolved oxygen.|$|E
5|$|<b>Manganese</b> is mined in South Africa, Australia, China, Brazil, Gabon, Ukraine, India, Fiji and Ghana and Kazakhstan. US Import Sources (1998–2001): <b>Manganese</b> ore: Gabon, 70%; South Africa, 10%; Australia, 9%; Mexico, 5%; and other, 6%. Ferromanganese: South Africa, 47%; France, 22%; Mexico, 8%; Australia, 8%; and other, 15%. <b>Manganese</b> {{contained}} in all <b>manganese</b> imports: South Africa, 31%; Gabon, 21%; Australia, 13%; Mexico, 8%; and other, 27%.|$|E
5|$|<b>Manganese</b> {{overexposure}} is {{most frequently}} associated with manganism, a rare neurological disorder associated with excessive <b>manganese</b> ingestion or inhalation. Historically, persons {{employed in the}} production or processing of <b>manganese</b> alloys have been at risk for developing manganism; however, current health and safety regulations protect workers in developed nations. The disorder was first described in 1837 by British academic John Couper, who studied two patients who were <b>manganese</b> grinders.|$|E
5|$|<b>Manganese</b> {{phosphating}} is {{used for}} rust and corrosion prevention on steel. Ionized <b>manganese</b> is used industrially as pigments of various colors, which depend on the oxidation state of the ions. The permanganates of alkali and alkaline earth metals are powerful oxidizers. <b>Manganese</b> dioxide is used as the cathode (electron acceptor) material in zinc-carbon and alkaline batteries.|$|E
5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl <b>manganese</b> tricarbonyl (MMT) is a {{gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing <b>manganese</b> tend to form <b>manganese</b> carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or <b>manganese</b> additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the lowest price per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of <b>manganese</b> in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban <b>manganese</b> compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% <b>manganese.</b> Elevated atmospheric <b>manganese</b> concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|E
5|$|Several {{colorful}} oxides of <b>manganese,</b> {{for example}} <b>manganese</b> dioxide, are abundant in nature {{have been used}} as pigments since the Stone Age. The cave paintings in Gargas that are 30,000 to 24,000 years old contain <b>manganese</b> pigments.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} <b>manganese</b> improve the {{workability}} of steel at high temperatures by forming a high-melting sulfide and preventing {{the formation of}} a liquid iron sulfide at the grain boundaries. If the <b>manganese</b> content reaches 4%, the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature. The embrittlement decreases at higher <b>manganese</b> concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8%. Steel containing 8 to 15% of <b>manganese</b> has a high tensile strength of up to 863MPa. Steel with 12% <b>manganese</b> was discovered in 1882 by Robert Hadfield and is still known as Hadfield steel. It was used for British military steel helmets and later by the U.S. military.|$|E
5|$|The {{human body}} {{contains}} about 12mg of <b>manganese,</b> {{mostly in the}} bones. The soft tissue remainder is concentrated in the liver and kidneys. In the human brain, the <b>manganese</b> is bound to <b>manganese</b> metalloproteins, most notably glutamine synthetase in astrocytes.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of the Leclanché cell in 1866 and the subsequent improvement of the batteries containing <b>manganese</b> dioxide as cathodic depolarizer increased the demand of <b>manganese</b> dioxide. Until the development batteries with nickel-cadmium and lithium, most batteries contained <b>manganese.</b> The zinc-carbon battery and the alkaline battery normally use industrially produced <b>manganese</b> dioxide because natural occurring <b>manganese</b> dioxide contains impurities. In the 20th century, <b>manganese</b> dioxide was widely used as the cathodic for commercial disposable dry batteries of both the standard (zinc-carbon) and alkaline types.|$|E
5|$|The <b>manganese</b> {{content of}} some iron ores used in Greece led to speculations that steel {{produced}} from that ore contains additional <b>manganese,</b> making the Spartan steel exceptionally hard. Around {{the beginning of}} the 19th century, <b>manganese</b> was used in steelmaking and several patents were granted. In 1816, it was documented that iron alloyed with <b>manganese</b> was harder but not more brittle. In 1837, British academic James Couper noted an association between miners' heavy exposure to <b>manganese</b> with a form of Parkinson's disease. In 1912, United States patents were granted for protecting firearms against rust and corrosion with <b>manganese</b> phosphate electrochemical conversion coatings, and the process has seen widespread use ever since.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} <b>manganese</b> ore is pyrolusite (MnO2). Other economically important <b>manganese</b> ores usually show a close spatial {{relation to the}} iron ores. Land-based resources are large but irregularly distributed. About 80% of the known world <b>manganese</b> resources are in South Africa; other important <b>manganese</b> deposits are in Ukraine, Australia, India, China, Gabon and Brazil. According to 1978 estimate, the ocean floor has 500 billion tons of <b>manganese</b> nodules. Attempts to find economically viable methods of harvesting <b>manganese</b> nodules were abandoned in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{second largest}} {{application}} for <b>manganese</b> is in aluminum alloys. Aluminium with roughly 1.5% <b>manganese</b> has increased {{resistance to corrosion}} through grains that absorb impurities which would lead to galvanic corrosion. The corrosion-resistant aluminium alloys 3004 and 3104 (0.8 to 1.5% <b>manganese)</b> are used for most beverage cans. Before year 2000, more than 1.6 million tonnes of those alloys were used; at 1% <b>manganese,</b> this consumed 16,000 tonnes of <b>manganese.</b>|$|E
5|$|Waterborne <b>manganese</b> has {{a greater}} {{bioavailability}} than dietary <b>manganese.</b> According to results from a 2010 study, higher levels of exposure to <b>manganese</b> in drinking water are associated with increased intellectual impairment and reduced intelligence quotients in school-age children. It is hypothesized that long-term exposure to the naturally occurring <b>manganese</b> in shower water puts up to 8.7 million Americans at risk. However, data indicates that the human body can recover from certain adverse effects of overexposure to <b>manganese</b> if the exposure is stopped and the body can clear the excess.|$|E
5|$|Common {{titanium}} alloys {{are made by}} reduction. For example, cuprotitanium (rutile with copper added is reduced), ferrocarbon titanium (ilmenite reduced with coke in an electric furnace), and manganotitanium (rutile with <b>manganese</b> or <b>manganese</b> oxides) are reduced.|$|E
5|$|Historically, <b>manganese</b> {{is named}} for {{pyrolusite}} and other black minerals from the region of Magnesia in Greece, which also gave its name to magnesium and the iron ore magnetite. By the mid-18th century, Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele had used pyrolusite to produce chlorine. Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite (now known to be <b>manganese</b> dioxide) contained a new element, but {{they were unable to}} isolate it. Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of <b>manganese</b> metal in 1774, which he did by reducing the dioxide with carbon.|$|E
5|$|<b>Manganese</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Mn and atomic number 25. It is not found {{as a free}} element in nature; it is often found in minerals in combination with iron. <b>Manganese</b> is a metal with important industrial metal alloy uses, particularly in stainless steels.|$|E
5|$|<b>Manganese</b> is also {{important}} in photosynthetic oxygen evolution in chloroplasts in plants. The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) {{is a part of}} photosystem II contained in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts; it is responsible for the terminal photooxidation of water during the light reactions of photosynthesis, and has a metalloenzyme core containing four atoms of <b>manganese.</b> To fulfill this requirement, most broad-spectrum plant fertilizers contain <b>manganese.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Manganese</b> is an {{important}} element for human health, essential for development, metabolism, and the antioxidant system. Nevertheless, excessive exposure or intake {{may lead to a}} condition known as manganism, a neurodegenerative disorder that causes dopaminergic neuronal death and symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease. The classes of enzymes that have <b>manganese</b> cofactors is large and includes oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, ligases, lectins, and integrins. The reverse transcriptases of many retroviruses (though not lentiviruses such as HIV) contain <b>manganese.</b> The best-known manganese-containing polypeptides may be arginase, the diphtheria toxin, and Mn-containing superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD).|$|E
5|$|<b>Manganese</b> is {{essential}} to {{iron and steel production}} by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, deoxidizing, and alloying properties, as first recognized by the British metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet (1811 - 1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of Spiegeleisen, into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus in order to improve its malleability. Steelmaking, including its ironmaking component, has accounted for most <b>manganese</b> demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand. <b>Manganese</b> is a key component of low-cost stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|Manganese(IV) oxide {{was used}} in the {{original}} type of dry cell battery as an electron acceptor from zinc, and is the blackish material in carbon–zinc type flashlight cells. The <b>manganese</b> dioxide is reduced to the <b>manganese</b> oxide-hydroxide MnO(OH) during discharging, preventing the formation of hydrogen at the anode of the battery.|$|E
5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl <b>manganese</b> tricarbonyl {{is used as}} an {{additive}} in {{unleaded gasoline}} to boost octane rating and reduce engine knocking. The <b>manganese</b> in this unusual organometallic compound is in the +1 oxidation state.|$|E
5|$|Scheele {{and other}} chemists {{were aware that}} <b>manganese</b> dioxide {{contained}} a new element, {{but they were not}} able to isolate it. Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of <b>manganese</b> metal in 1774, by reducing the dioxide with carbon.|$|E
5|$|Steel alloys {{used for}} dive {{cylinder}} manufacture are authorised by the manufacturing standard. For example, the US standard DOT 3AA requires {{the use of}} open-hearth, basic oxygen, or electric steel of uniform quality. Approved alloys include 4130X, NE-8630, 9115, 9125, Carbon-boron and Intermediate <b>manganese,</b> with specified constituents, including <b>manganese</b> and carbon, and molybdenum, chromium, boron, nickel or zirconium.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for {{minerals}} in 2001. For <b>manganese</b> {{there was}} not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs, so needs are described as estimates for Adequate Intakes (AIs). The current AIs for <b>manganese</b> for women and men ages 19 and up are 1.8 and 2.3 mg/day, respectively. AI for pregnancy is 2.0 mg/day. AI for lactation is 2.6 μg/day. For children ages 1–18 years the AI increases with age from 1.2 to 2.2 mg/day for males, to 1.6 mg/day for females. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of <b>manganese</b> the adult UL is set at 11 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs {{are referred to as}} Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) <b>Manganese</b> deficiency is rare.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{oxidation}} states of <b>manganese</b> are +2, +3, +4, +6, and +7, though all oxidation states from −3 to +7 have been observed. Mn2+ often competes with Mg2+ in biological systems. <b>Manganese</b> compounds where <b>manganese</b> is in oxidation state +7, which are mostly {{restricted to the}} unstable oxide Mn2O7, compounds of the intensely purple permanganate anion MnO4−, and a few oxyhalides (MnO3F and MnO3Cl), are powerful oxidizing agents. Compounds with oxidation states +5 (blue) and +6 (green) are strong oxidizing agents and are vulnerable to disproportionation.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name <b>manganese</b> is complex. In ancient times, two black {{minerals}} from Magnesia (located within modern Greece) were both called magnes from their place of origin, but were thought to differ in gender. The male magnes attracted iron, and was the iron ore now known as lodestone or magnetite, and which probably gave us the term magnet. The female magnes ore did not attract iron, but was used to decolorize glass. This feminine magnes was later called magnesia, known now in modern times as pyrolusite or <b>manganese</b> dioxide. Neither this mineral nor elemental <b>manganese</b> is magnetic. In the 16th century, <b>manganese</b> dioxide was called manganesum (note the two Ns instead of one) by glassmakers, possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words, since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a magnesia negra (the black ore) from magnesia alba (a white ore, also from Magnesia, also useful in glassmaking). Michele Mercati called magnesia negra manganesa, and finally the metal isolated from it became known as <b>manganese</b> (German: Mangan). The name magnesia eventually was then used to refer only to the white magnesia alba (magnesium oxide), which provided the name magnesium for the free element when it was isolated much later.|$|E
5|$|At the USGS {{gauging station}} on Kettle Creek, the {{concentration}} of iron is 0.15 milligrams per liter, {{the concentration of}} <b>manganese</b> is 0.04 milligrams per liter, and the concentration of aluminum is 0.14 milligrams per liter. The acidity concentration is 0.64 milligrams per liter and the concentration of alkalinity is 11.36 milligrams per liter. At the mouth of Twomile Run, the concentration of iron is 5.09 milligrams per liter, the concentration of <b>manganese</b> is 6.44 milligrams per liter, and the aluminum concentration is 8.57 milligrams per liter.
