50|$|Hypocitraturia or low urinary citrate {{excretion}} (defined as {{lower than}} 320 mg/day) can cause kidney stones {{in up to}} 2/3 of cases. The protective role of citrate is linked to several mechanisms; in fact, citrate reduces urinary supersaturation of calcium salts by forming soluble complexes with calcium ions and by inhibiting crystal growth and aggregation. The therapy with potassium citrate, or <b>magnesium</b> <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate,</b> is commonly prescribed in clinical practice {{in order to increase}} urinary citrate and to reduce stone formation rates.|$|E
40|$|About 10 % of {{the people}} {{is the subject of}} an episode of kidney stones during their lifetime, about 70 % of these people {{undergoes}} relapses. About 80 % of the urinary stones contains calcium, of wich 80 % is formed of calcium oxalate, in pure form or associated with calcium phosphate. Therefore we can saythat in most cases (about 65 %) the urinary stones are composedof calcium oxalate. Use of supplements of potassium citrate and magnesium citrate can help in the prevention of kidney stones of calcium oxalate, but mostly they can be used in the days before a shockwaves lithotripsy treatment to make the stones more fragile to the effect of the shock waves.

40|$|The {{fertilizing}} {{capacity of}} pure, fresh avian semen may disappear in just half an hour, hindering its successful use in artificial insemination (AI) projects. Longer storage requires {{the use of}} infra-physiological temperatures and of semen diluents that help preserve the spermatozoa but that do not interfere with their fertilizing capacity. This study examines the effect on sperm quality of storing red-legged partridge sperm for 3 h at 5 °C with 2 different semen extenders: 1) a medium referred to as L&R- 84, composed of sodium glutamate, glucose, <b>magnesium</b> acetate, <b>potassium</b> acetate, and polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 2) Lake 7. 1 medium, composed of sodium glutamate, glucose, <b>magnesium</b> acetate, <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate,</b> and N,N-Bis(2 -hydroxyethyl) taurine (BES). Extending with L&R- 84 returned better curvilinear velocity (P < 0. 01), straight-line velocity (P < 0. 01), average path velocity (P < 0. 01), linearity (P < 0. 05), straightness (P < 0. 05), and wobble (P < 0. 05) values, while extending with the Lake 7. 1 medium was associated with higher percentages (P < 0. 001) of motile sperm. The fertility rate was higher (P < 0. 05) when birds were inseminated with L&R- 84 -extended sperm than with Lake 7. 1 -extended sperm. The mean number of penetrations of perivitelline layer samples (taken from above the germinal disc) was also higher for the L&R- 84 -extended sperm (P < 0. 05). These results show L&R- 84 can be recommended as an extender for red-legged partridge semen to be stored for at least 3 h at 5 °C...|$|R

Materials and Methods: A total of 247 patients with recurrent idiopathic hypocitraturia with or without hyperuricosuria and randomized controls were studied prospectively for 3 years. The total patients were divided into three groups. Control group 1 consisted of 61 patients (24. 7 %) who had moderate to severe hypocitraturia with or without hyper-uricosuria and were recurrent stone formers but discontinued prophylaxis because of drug intolerance within 1 month of therapy. Control group 2 constituted 53 patients (21. 5 %) who were first-time stone formers and who had mild hypocitraturia with or without hyperuricosuria and were not put on prophylactic therapy and were followed for 3. 16 ± 0. 08 years. Control group 3 constituted 133 patients (54. 8 %) who were re-current stone formers who had moderate to severe hypocitraturia with or without hy-peruricosuria and were put on prophylaxis therapy and were followed for 3. 16 ± 0. 08 years.

40|$|Effect of potassium-magnesium citrate on urinary {{biochemistry}} and crystallization of stone-forming salts {{was compared}} with that of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> at same dose of potassium in five normal subjects and five patients with calcium nephrolithiasis. Compared to the placebo phase, urinary pH rose significantly from 6. 06 +/- 0. 27 to 6. 48 +/- 0. 36 (mean +/- SD, p less than 0. 0167) during treatment with <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> (50 mEq/day for 7 days) and to 6. 68 +/- 0. 31 during therapy with potassium-magnesium citrate (containing 49 mEq K, 24. 5 mEq Mg, and 73. 5 mEq citrate per day). Urinary pH was significantly higher during potassium-magnesium <b>citrate</b> than during <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> therapy. Thus, the amount of undissociated uric acid declined from 118 +/- 61 mg/day during the placebo phase to 68 +/- 54 mg/day during <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> treatment and, more prominently, to 41 +/- 46 mg/day during potassium-magnesium citrate therapy. Urinary magnesium rose significantly from 102 +/- 25 to 146 +/- 37 mg/day during potassium-magnesium citrate therapy but not during <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> therapy. Urinary citrate rose more prominently during potassium-magnesium citrate therapy (to 1027 +/- 478 mg/day from 638 +/- 252 mg/day) than during <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> treatment (to 932 +/- 297 mg/day). Consequently, urinary saturation (activity product) of calcium oxalate declined significantly (from 1. 49 x 10 (- 8) to 1. 03 x 10 (- 8) M 2) during potassium-magnesium citrate therapy and marginally (to 1. 14 x 10 (- 8) M 2) during <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> therapy.

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{investigate}} the correlations and agreements between the solute/creatinine ratios from the 24 -hour and early morning spot urine samples for metabolic evaluation in stone-formers given the various pitfalls with the 24 -hour urinary metabolic evaluation in stone-formers. METHODS 30 urinary stone-formers {{out of an}} initial 62 recruited provided a complete 24 -hour urine and early morning spot urine samples for metabolic evaluation. Pearson correlation and Bland and Altman Test {{were used to assess}} the correlations and agreements. RESULTS Significant correlations were established between the 24 -hour urinary solute excretions and the corresponding early morning spot urine solute/creatinine ratios for calcium, <b>magnesium,</b> urate, <b>potassium,</b> oxalate, <b>citrate,</b> and the Differential Gibb's free energy value of calcium oxalate DG(CaOx) values. However, all these solute/creatinine measurements between the 24 -hour and early morning spot urine samples were judged to be not within the acceptable limits based on the estimated "limit of agreement" by the Bland and Altman Test of Agreement. Diurnal circadian rhythm and postprandial excretion surge are thought to be responsible for the disagreements. CONCLUSIONS Thus, the early morning spot urine is not suitable to be used interchangeably to replace the 24 -hour urine collection in the evaluation of urinary metabolic abnormalities in stone-formers. A good correlation does not translate to an agreement between the 2 measurements. UROLOGY 75 : 1294 - 1298, 2010. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
40|$|Citrate is an {{inhibitor}} of the crystallization of stone-forming calcium salts. Hypocitraturia, frequently {{encountered in}} patients with nephrolithiasis, is therefore an important risk factor for stone formation. <b>Potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> provides physiological and physicochemical correction and inhibits new stone formation, not only in hypocitraturic calcium nephrolithiasis but also in uric acid nephrolithiasis. Inhibition of stone recurrence has now been validated by a randomized trial. Ongoing research has disclosed additional causes of hypocitraturia (sodium excess, low intestinal alkali absorption, but not primary citrate malabsorption). Moreover, new insights on <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> action have been shown, notably that some of absorbed citrate escapes oxidation and contributes to the citraturic response, that ingestion with a meal does not sacrifice physiological or physicochemical action, that orange juice mimics but does not completely duplicate its actions, that <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> may have a beneficial bone-sparing effect, that it may reduce stone fragments following ESWL, and that danger of aluminum toxicity is not great in subjects with functioning kidneys. Finally, the research on <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> has led to two promising products, calcium citrate as an optimum calcium supplement and potassium-magnesium citrate which may be superior to <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> {{in the management of}} stone disease...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the inhibition effects of the terpenoid of Plantago major on calcium oxalate crystals in vitro and to compare the effects of Plantago major with clinically used drugs like zyloric and <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> for the treatment of urinary stone. Modified Schneider slide gel method was used for in vitro study and crystals formed were measured by Image Analyser System (Leica) after 24 h of treatment. The active compound in the methanol extract of Plantago major was isolated by bioassay - guided fractionation & isolation method. Dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) was used as the negative control and zyloric and <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> were used as positive controls. The results showed that crude methanol extract of Plantago major contained the active compound terpenoid. Terpenoid, zyloric and <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> at concentrations in the range of (100 μg/ml - 250 μg/ml) significantly inhibited the area of crystal formation in comparison to the negative control after 24 h (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} by {{a prospective}} randomized controlled study {{the efficacy of}} the association of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> and dry extract of couch grass (Agropyrum repens) (CalcoMEV®) in renal stone treatment. Materials and Methods: 50 patients with nephrolithiasis associated with one or more active metabolic alterations that constitute an indication to the use of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> were randomly divided in two equal unblinded treatment groups. A group of patients was assigned to treatment with the association of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> and couch grass (at the dose of 24 mEq of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> and 100 mg of dry extract of Agropyrum repens bis in die) and the other group to <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> (at a dose of 20 mEq ter in die). Each form of main treatment was associated, depending on the results of metabolic basal assessment, to allopurinol and/or an association of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide and/or pyridoxine. Patients of both groups were advised the same diet based on a reduced intake of sodium, foods rich in oxalate and protein of animal origin, a normalized intake of calcium and an increase in fluid intake (> 2 liters every day). Results: At the end of the 5 -month follow-up period, the group treated with the association of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> and couch grass showed a significant reduction in the total number of stones (- 1. 0 ± 0. 2 vs 0. 0 ± 0. 2 stones) and in the larger diameter of the stones (- 3. 6 ± 0. 9 mm vs 0. 0 ± 0. 8 mm), as well as a statistically significant reduction of uric acid urinary excretion (- 164. 7 ± 45. 3 vs - 38 ± 42 mg/ 24 h). No significant differences in the two groups were observed with respect to urinary citrate, oxalate and calcium urinary excretions and urinary pH. Conclusions: This prospective randomized study demonstrates the superiority of the association of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> and dry extract of couch grass, in combination with standard pharmacological and dietary treatment, in reducing the number and size of urinary stones with respect to <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> in association with the same pharmacological and dietary regimen...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Acidosis and {{transplantation}} {{are associated}} with increased risk of bone disturbances. This study aimed to assess bone morphology and metabolism in acidotic patients with a renal graft, and to ameliorate bone characteristics by restoration of acid/base homeostasis with <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate.</b> METHODS: This was a 12 -month controlled, randomized, interventional trial that included 30 renal transplant patients with metabolic acidosis (S-[HCO(3) (-) ] 24 mmol/L, or potassium chloride (control group). Iliac crest bone biopsies and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were performed at baseline and after 12 months of treatment. Bone biopsies were analyzed by in vitro micro-computed tomography and histomorphometry, including tetracycline double labeling. Serum biomarkers of bone turnover were measured at baseline and study end. Twenty-three healthy participants with normal kidney function comprised the reference group. RESULTS: Administration of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> resulted in persisting normalization of S-[HCO(3) (-) ] versus potassium chloride. At 12 months, bone surface, connectivity density, cortical thickness, and cortical porosity were better preserved with <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> than with <b>potassium</b> chloride, respectively. Serological biomarkers and bone tetracycline labeling indicate higher bone turnover with <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> versus <b>potassium</b> chloride.
