5|$|As a halogen, {{astatine}} {{tends to}} be classified as a nonmetal. It has some marked metallic properties and is sometimes instead classified as either a metalloid or (less often) as a metal. Immediately following its production in 1940, early investigators considered it a <b>metal.</b> <b>In</b> 1949 {{it was called the}} most noble (difficult to reduce) nonmetal as well as being a relatively noble (difficult to oxidize) <b>metal.</b> <b>In</b> 1950 astatine was described as a halogen and (therefore) a reactive nonmetal. In 2013, on the basis of relativistic modelling, astatine was predicted to be a monatomic metal, with a face-centred cubic crystalline structure.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the effects of the application of organic amendments on the behavior of heavy <b>metals</b> <b>in</b> contaminated farmland soils, field plot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of the addition of six different organic amendments on the activity of heavy <b>metals</b> <b>in</b> soils, concentration of heavy <b>metals</b> <b>in</b> surface water, and heavy metal uptake by rice plants. The tested six organic amendments were composted rice straw, fresh chicken manure, composted chicken manure, fresh pig manure, composted pig manure and commercial organic fertilizer. The results showed that application of all of the six organic fertilizers could obviously increase the contents of water soluble heavy <b>metals</b> <b>in</b> the soils and concentrations of heavy <b>metals</b> <b>in</b> the surface water at early stage of the experiment, as compared with the control without application of organic manure. The increase in the contents of water soluble heavy <b>metals</b> <b>in</b> the soils and concentrations of heavy <b>metals</b> <b>in</b> the field surface water were highest for fresh pig manure, followed by fresh chicken, and the lowest for commercial organic fertilizers. The contents of heavy <b>metals</b> <b>in</b> soils and the concentrations of heavy <b>metals</b> <b>in</b> field surface water decreased with the increase of the experimental time. The effects of applying organic fertilizer on the accumulation of heavy <b>metals</b> <b>in</b> rice grains was not obvious. Correlation analysis showed that the contents of water soluble heavy <b>metals</b> <b>in</b> soils, and concentrations of heavy <b>metals</b> <b>in</b> field surface water were all significantly correlated with the corresponding DOC concentration, suggesting that the increase of DOC could promote the activation of heavy <b>metals</b> <b>in</b> soils. The difference in the activity of heavy <b>metals</b> <b>in</b> soils added with different organic amendments might be due to the difference in the degree of decomposition and release DOC capacity of the added organic amendments. But the research also showed that the soil DOC decreased gradually with the increasing time of organic fertilizer application. Therefore, the activation of heavy <b>metals</b> <b>in</b> farmland soils caused by organic manure was temporary, and the accumulation of heavy <b>metals</b> <b>in</b> the grain during the late rice growth was not obvious...|$|R

40|$|The Solid Waste Association of North America (SWANA) Applied Research Foundation report {{which claims}} that heavy <b>metals</b> <b>in</b> {{municipal}} solid waste (MSW) landfill leachate do not represent a threat to cause groundwater pollution {{is based on a}} flawed approach for assessing the critical concentrations of heavy <b>metals</b> <b>in</b> MSW leachate that can be adverse to groundwater quality. This report uses the US EPA TCLP regulatory limit as a measure of the concentrations of heavy <b>metals</b> <b>in</b> MSW leachate that would not cause groundwater pollution. The TCLP regulatory limits were established to classify wastes as “hazardous ” versus “nonhazardous. ” So-called “nonhazardous ” waste components can generate leachate that is a significant threat to public health and the environment.
