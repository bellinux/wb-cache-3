5|$|At the time, some Muslim Indian leaders {{feared that}} <b>Muslims</b> <b>were</b> losing their {{religious}} identity {{to the majority}} Hindu culture. The movement was never given any name officially, but Ilyas {{used to call it}} Tahrik-i Imaan.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} Thomas Paul, Tipu {{shifted his}} hatred for the British to the Mangalorean Catholics and other South Indian Christian communities. Sita Ram Goel mentions that Tipu's {{justification for the}} conversion was that during the Portuguese domination, many <b>Muslims</b> <b>were</b> forcibly converted to Christianity. Tipu proclaimed his actions as a punishment for the conversion of Muslims to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Alerted by a witness, MalcolmX and a {{small group}} of Muslims went to the police station and demanded to see Johnson. Police {{initially}} denied that any <b>Muslims</b> <b>were</b> being held, but when the crowd grew to about five hundred, they allowed MalcolmX to speak with Johnson. Afterward, MalcolmX insisted on arranging for an ambulance to take Johnson to Harlem Hospital.|$|E
40|$|This essay aims to {{determine}} how <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> produced {{in the public domain}} in Swedish contemporary time. My study is based on three different materials; Hot mot demokrati och värdegrund – en lägesbild från Malmö investigating Islamist radicalism and extremism in Rosengård, articles on Omar Mustafa and his resignation from the Social Democratic Party and Gun Holmertz article Islamismen får allt större fäste i Hjällbo and the following debate. The method used is discourse analysis as {{the purpose of the study}} is to examine how <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> produced within the prevailing discourse. Theoretical points have been Postcolonial theory, Orientalism, Islamophobia and “us” and “them”. The results of the study confirm the results of earlier studies, namely that <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> not produced in a beneficial way. Consistently for all materials <b>is</b> how <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> produced in a homogenizing way but also that <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> not allowed to represent themselves. The stereotype of a <b>Muslim</b> <b>is</b> that he is violent and oppressive of women, and that the <b>Muslim</b> women <b>are</b> oppressed. <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> also often represented, they are not given the opportunity to speak for themselves, resulting in Muslims themselves must never speak about their own position. <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> portrayed as "the other", those who are very different from “us”...|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of Sierra Leonean <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> adherent to Sunni Islam. Significant portions of Sierra Leonean <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> Ahmadis, Shia, and Non-denominational Muslims. http://sierraleone365.com/feature-stories/ahmadiyya-movement-goes-mainstream-in-sierra-leonehttp://ahmadiyyatimes.blogspot.com/2010/03/bo-ahmadiya-muslim-secondary-school.html.|$|R
5000|$|Around 31% of all <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> of South Asian origin (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and India combined). The Indian subcontinent as a whole, therefore, {{hosts the}} largest {{population}} of Muslims in the world, Within this region, however, <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> second in numbers to Hindus, as <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> {{a majority in}} Pakistan and Bangladesh, but not India.|$|R
5|$|No {{operations}} {{are reported in}} Sicily {{for the first two}} years after the fall of Palermo. The <b>Muslims</b> <b>were</b> probably preoccupied with organizing their new province, while the Byzantines were too weak to react, and could not expect any reinforcements: the Empire faced mounting pressure in the East, where the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mun launched repeated invasions of the Byzantine borderlands and threatened to march on Constantinople itself until his sudden death in August 833.|$|E
5|$|Polarization {{of voting}} {{patterns}} based on religion {{was evident in}} the eastern provinces. Christianity-based Prosperous Peace Party (PDS) received 14.8 percent of votes in Christian-dominant North Sulawesi and 13 seats overall in the People's Representative Council. Likewise, <b>Muslims</b> <b>were</b> more likely to vote for the PKS in regions where religious conflict has been historically prevalent.|$|E
5|$|Three {{months after}} the conquest of Granada, in 1492, the Alhambra Decree ordered all Jews in Spain to be {{expelled}} or converted; this {{marked the beginning of}} intolerant policies. In 1497, Spain's western neighbor Portugal expelled its Jewish and Muslim populations, as arranged by Spain's cardinal Cisneros in exchange for a royal marriage contract. Unlike the Jews, Portuguese <b>Muslims</b> <b>were</b> allowed to relocate overland to Spain, and most did.|$|E
50|$|<b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> a small {{minority}} in Buddhist-majority Laos and constitute about 0.01% of the population. <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> visible in the capital, Vientiane, which has a mosque.|$|R
50|$|<b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> a {{majority}} in the Lakshadweep and Jammu and Kashmir states/territories of India, and in some other districts of India. However, <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> a minority in India overall.|$|R

5|$|While the <b>Muslims</b> <b>were</b> {{occupied}} at Fahl, Heraclius, {{sensing the}} opportunity, quickly sent an army under General Theodras to recapture Damascus. Shortly after Heraclius dispatched this new army, the Muslims having finished {{the business at}} Fahl, {{were on their way}} to Emesa. The Byzantine army met the Muslims half way to Emesa, at Maraj-al-Rome. During the night Theodras sent half of his army towards Damascus to launch a surprise attack on the Muslim garrison.|$|E
5|$|After Operation Save, the {{division}} remained relatively static {{for more than}} three weeks, mopping up and repelling local Partisan attacks. The <b>Muslims</b> <b>were</b> impatient to push further into Bosnia, but the reconnaissance battalion was heavily engaged on {{the division}}al western flank, attacking positions held by the Partisan 3rd Vojvodina Brigade of the 36th Vojvodina Division at Gornji Rahić on 26 March, killing 124 Partisans and capturing 14. The battalion captured several more Partisan positions in the following week. In early April, 200 Partisans of the 16th Muslim Brigade surrendered to the division. They were mostly former members of various Muslim militias who had been conscripted into the ranks of the Partisans.|$|E
5|$|As {{a medieval}} Christian author William could hardly avoid hostility towards the kingdom's Muslim neighbours, {{but as an}} educated man who lived among Muslims in the east, he was rarely polemical or {{completely}} dismissive of Islam. He did not think <b>Muslims</b> <b>were</b> pagans, but rather that they belonged to a heretical sect of Christianity and followed the teachings of a false prophet. He often praised the Muslim leaders of his own day, even if he lamented their power over the Christian kingdom; thus Muslim rulers such as Mu'in ad-Din Unur, Nur ad-Din, Shirkuh, and even Jerusalem's ultimate conqueror Saladin are presented as honourable and pious men, characteristics that William did not bestow on many of his own Christian contemporaries.|$|E
50|$|<b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> {{slightly}} {{less likely to}} vote in elections than non-Muslims {{at a rate of}} 69% compared to 77%, respectively. The most popular party among immigrants, including <b>Muslims,</b> <b>is</b> the Labour Party.|$|R
5000|$|In {{keeping with}} the sunnah of Muhammad, <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> {{encouraged}} to prepare themselves for the occasion of Eid. Below {{is a list of}} things <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> recommended to do in preparation for the Eid al-Adha festival: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Muslim</b> <b>was</b> {{calm and}} {{composed}} {{as he was}} dragged up the steps. He was reciting [...] "Allahu Akber" [...] until the last moment. Then there was an absolute silence followed by a thud {{as the head of}} <b>Muslim</b> <b>was</b> chopped and his body fell to the ground. This was on the 9th of Dhul-Hujja. Immediately after <b>Muslim</b> <b>was</b> killed, Hani ibn Urwah as well was dragged to the roof top and executed.|$|R
5|$|During the trial, the {{defendant}} Wiens appeared reserved but was noted for extreme statements. He said that <b>Muslims</b> <b>were</b> monsters {{to him and}} asked the court why they were not deported after the 9/11 attacks. He stated that German people should not mingle with foreigners and declared that he would vote for the far right National Democratic Party of Germany. The judge then requested a verbatim record, while the defence counsel tried to mediate. Wiens continued in this fashion, prompting the judge to ask whether he had ever visited a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|In Algeria, the <b>Muslims</b> <b>were</b> not {{considered}} French {{and did not}} share the same political or economic benefits. For example, the indigenous population did not own most of the settlements, farms, or businesses, although they numbered nearly nine million (versus roughly one million Pieds-Noirs) at independence. Politically, the Muslim Algerians had no representation in the French National Assembly until 1945 and wielded limited influence in local governance. To obtain citizenship, {{they were required to}} renounce their Muslim identity. Since this would constitute apostasy, only about 2,500Muslims acquired citizenship before 1930. The settlers' politically and economically dominant position worsened relations between the two groups.|$|E
5|$|In October 1242, Nablus was raided by the Knights Templar. This was the {{conclusion}} of the 1242 campaign season in which the Templars had joined forces with the Ayyubid emir of Kerak, An-Nasir Dawud, against the Mamluks. The Templars raided Nablus in revenge for a preceding massacre of Christians by their erstwhile ally An-Nasir Dawud. The attack is reported as a particularly bloody affair lasting for three days, during which the Mosque was burned and many residents of the city, Christians alongside <b>Muslims,</b> <b>were</b> killed or sold in the slave markets of Acre.|$|E
50|$|The Dogra <b>Muslim</b> <b>are</b> a <b>Muslim</b> {{community}} {{found in}} the state of Jammu and Kashmir. They <b>are</b> <b>Muslim</b> converts from the larger Hindu Dogra community. A large number of Dogra <b>Muslim</b> <b>are</b> also now {{found in the}} province of Punjab in Pakistan. They are also known as Rajahs, especially in Pakistan.|$|R
50|$|Many Macedonian <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> {{involved}} in agriculture, and also work abroad. Macedonian <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> {{well known as}} fresco-painters, wood carvers and mosaic-makers. In {{the past few decades}} large numbers of Macedonian Muslims have emigrated to Western Europe and North America.|$|R
5000|$|According to a 1900 source, the {{district}} was inhabited by 48,321 people, out of whom 34,191 were Christian Slavs, [...] 500 <b>were</b> <b>Muslim</b> Slavs, 6,150 <b>were</b> <b>Muslim</b> Turks, [...] 300 <b>were</b> <b>Muslim</b> Circassians, 6,166 <b>were</b> <b>Muslim</b> Albanians, [...] 50 were Christian Vlachs, [...] 30 were Jews, and 1,034 <b>were</b> <b>Muslim</b> and Christian Romani.|$|R
5|$|In {{the same}} period, the Sicilian Muslims also {{established}} footholds in the Italian mainland. The <b>Muslims</b> <b>were</b> asked {{to assist the}} beleaguered Duchy of Naples against Sicard of Benevento in 839, but then they sacked Brindisi and, following Sicard's murder and the outbreak of {{civil war in the}} Principality of Benevento, seized Tarentum in 840 and Bari in 847, which they made their bases. Until well into the 880s, the Muslims would launch destructive raids along the coasts of Italy and into the Adriatic Sea from their bases on the Italian mainland — most notably from the Emirate of Bari, until its destruction in 871.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{efforts at}} forcing the {{conversions}} of Spanish <b>Muslims</b> <b>were</b> started by Cardinal Cisneros, {{the archbishop of}} Toledo, who arrived in Granada {{in the autumn of}} 1499. In contrast to Granada's own archbishop Hernando de Talavera, who had friendly relations with the Muslim population and relied on a peaceful approach towards conversions, Cisneros adopted harsh and authoritarian measures. He sent uncooperative Muslims, especially noblemen, to prison where they were treated severely (including reports of torture) until they converted. Cisneros ignored warnings from his council that these methods might violate the Treaty of Granada, which guaranteed the Muslims freedom of religion. Instead, he intensified his efforts, and in December he wrote to Pope Alexander VI that he converted 3,000 Muslims in a single day.|$|E
5|$|Peter Hervik {{said that}} the cartoon {{controversy}} must {{be seen in the}} context of an increasingly politicised media environment in Denmark since the 1990s, increasingly negative coverage of Islam and the Muslim minority in Denmark, anti-Muslim rhetoric from the governing political parties, and government policies such as restrictions on immigration and the abolishment of the Board for Ethnic Equality in 2002. Hervik said these themes are often ignored in international coverage of the issue and that they render conclusions that Jyllands-Posten and the Danish government were innocent victims in a dispute over freedom of speech inaccurate. Against this background, Danish <b>Muslims</b> <b>were</b> particularly offended by the cartoons because they reinforced the idea that Danes stigmatize all Muslims as terrorists and do not respect their religious beliefs.|$|E
50|$|Demographers {{have put}} forward several factors behind high birthrates among Muslims in India. Another reason for high {{fertility}} rate among <b>Muslims</b> <b>is</b> {{they have the}} youngest median age compared to other religious groups in India. According to sociologists Roger and Patricia Jeffery, socio-economic conditions rather than religious determinism {{is the main reason}} for higher Muslim birthrates. Indian <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> poorer and less educated compared to their Hindu counterparts. Noted Indian sociologist, B.K. Prasad, argues that since India's <b>Muslim</b> population <b>is</b> more urban compared to their Hindu counterparts, infant mortality rates among <b>Muslims</b> <b>is</b> about 12% lower than those among Hindus.|$|R
5000|$|He has {{supported}} movements to let more Syrian refugees into Iraq, stating, “We <b>are</b> <b>Muslims,</b> they <b>are</b> <b>Muslims.</b> We <b>are</b> Arabs, they are Arabs, {{and we are}} happy to help them.” ...|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, Sura Al-Baqara 2:190-193 of the Quran {{requires}} that in combat <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> only allowed {{to strike back}} in self-defense against those who strike against them, but, on the other hand, once the enemies cease to attack, <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> then commanded to stop attacking.|$|R
5|$|Questions about Modi's {{relationship}} with <b>Muslims</b> <b>were</b> also raised by many Western nations {{during his tenure}} as chief minister. Modi was barred from entering the United States by the State Department, {{in accordance with the}} recommendations of the Commission on International Religious Freedom formed {{under the aegis of the}} International Religious Freedom Act, the only person denied a US visa under this law. The UK and the European Union refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK and the EU lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister he was invited to Washington.|$|E
5|$|The Naroda Patiya {{massacre}} {{took place}} on 28 February 2002 at Naroda, in Ahmedabad, India, during the 2002 Gujarat riots. 97 <b>Muslims</b> <b>were</b> killed by a mob of approximately 5,000 people, organised by the Bajrang Dal, a wing of the Vishva Hindu Parishad, {{and supported by the}} Bharatiya Janata Party which was in power in the Gujarat State Government. The massacre at Naroda occurred during the bandh (strike) called by Vishwa Hindu Parishad a day after the Godhra train burning. The riot lasted over 10 hours, during which the mob looted, stabbed, sexually assaulted, gang-raped and burnt people individually and in groups. After the conflict, a curfew was imposed in the state and army troops were called in to contain further violence.|$|E
5|$|The Umayyads were {{followed}} by the Abbasid dynasty which came to power {{with the help of}} Iranian Muslims. The persecution of Zoroastrians increased significantly under the Abbasids, temples and sacred-fire shrines were destroyed. Also during Abbasid rule, the status of Zoroastrians in Persian lands was reduced from zimmi (or dhimmi, people who were protected by the state and generally considered 'People of the Book') to 'kafirs' (non-believers). As a result, Zoroastrians were not granted the same rights and status as Jews and Christians. Iranian <b>Muslims</b> <b>were</b> welcomed to the court, but not Zoroastrians. Zoroastrians were denied access to bathhouses on the grounds that their bodies were polluted.|$|E
50|$|The Na-Asamiya <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> anthropologically and {{culturally}} {{different from the}} Assamese Muslims. The Assamese <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> medium statured, having leptorrhine nose and mesocephalic head. According to a comparative study conducted in Kamrup district in 1995, the pre-adolescent Assamese <b>Muslim</b> males <b>were</b> found to be shorter and lighter than their Na-Asamiya counterparts. The Na-Asamiyas are different from Assamese Muslims and Barak Valley Muslims in significant respects.|$|R
50|$|The state {{religion}} of Bahrain is Islam and most Bahraini citizens <b>are</b> <b>Muslim.</b> There <b>are</b> no official {{figures for the}} proportion of Shia and Sunni among the Muslims of Bahrain, but approximately 70% percent of Bahraini <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> Shia.|$|R
50|$|Pakistan {{is officially}} an Islamic country and defines who and who <b>is</b> not a <b>Muslim.</b> Under these conditions, Ahmadi <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> {{declared}} non-Muslim by {{law of the}} land and cannot practice their faith freely. They are not permitted to call their mosques as mosques, or meet with people with the Islamic greeting of Peace. Ahmadi <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> excluded from government and any other high-profile positions within Pakistan. There have been cases when the Ahmadi <b>Muslims</b> have <b>been</b> expelled from schools, colleges and Universities, for being Ahmadi Muslim. Once the entire population of Rabwah, the Pakistani headquarters of Ahmadi <b>Muslims</b> <b>was</b> charged under Anti-Ahmadiyya laws.|$|R
