[...] The frequency of the pole directly depends on the value of m. [...] The smaller the value of m, the closer the pole is to the cut-off frequency. [...] Conversely, a large value of m places the pole further away from cut-off until in the limit when m=1 the pole is at infinity and the response is the same as the k-type section. [...] If a value of m is chosen for this pole which is different from the pole of the end sections it will have the effect of broadening the band of good stopband rejection near to the cut-off frequency. [...] In this way the m-type sections serve to give good stopband rejection near to cut-off and the k-type sections give good stopband rejection far from cut-off. [...] Alternatively, m-type sections can be used {{in the body of}} the filter with different values of m if the value found in the end sections is unsuitable. [...] Here again, the mm'-type would have some advantages if used for impedance matching. [...] The mm'-type used for impedance matching places the pole at m=0.3.

50|$|It {{should be}} {{understood}} that the match of a load to the transmission line {{is different from the}} match of a source to the transmission line or the match of a source to the load seen through the transmission line. For instance, if there is a perfect match between the load impedance Zload and the source impedance Zsource=Z*load, that perfect match will remain if the source and load are connected through a transmission line with an electrical length of one half wavelength (or a multiple of one half wavelengths) using a transmission line of any characteristic impedance Z0. However the SWR will generally not be 1:1, depending only on Zload and Z0. With a different length of transmission line, the source will see a different impedance than Zload {{which may or may not}} be a good match to the source. Sometimes this is deliberate, as when a quarter-wave <b>matching</b> <b>section</b> is used to improve the match between an otherwise mismatched source and load.|$|E

The beam phase space dynamics is naturally integrated into the algorithm, instead of being treated as generic numerical parameters as in traditional schemes.

5000|$|In {{electrical}} systems involving {{transmission lines}} (such as radio and fiber optics)—where {{the length of}} the line is long compared to the wavelength of the signal (the signal changes rapidly compared to {{the time it takes to}} travel from source to load)— the impedances at each end of the line must be matched to the transmission line's characteristic impedance (...) to prevent reflections of the signal at the ends of the line. (When {{the length of the}} line is short compared to the wavelength, impedance mismatch is the basis of transmission-line impedance transformers; see previous section.) In radio-frequency (RF) systems, a common value for source and load impedances is 50 ohms. A typical RF load is a quarter-wave ground plane antenna (37 ohms with an ideal ground plane; it can be matched to 50 ohms by using a modified ground plane or a coaxial <b>matching</b> <b>section,</b> i.e., part or all the feeder of higher impedance).|$|E

40|$|Composite right-/left-handed (CRLH) {{transmission}} lines have gained {{great interest in}} the microwave community.
