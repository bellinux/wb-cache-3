40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an econometric investigation into financial markets and portfolio choice {{over the period}} 1955 - 56 to 1968 - 69. The theoretical framework adopted for the investigation draws heavily from the literature on portfolio choice surveyed in chapter 2, and in particular, from the <b>monetary</b> <b>articles</b> of James Tobin. The portfolios selected by the trading banks, the non-banking financial institutions and the non-financial private sector are successfully explained by variables representing real expected asset yields {{and the degree of}} credit rationing in the market for trading bank advances. A key variable influencing behaviour was found to be Tobin's supply price of capital, defined as that rate of return the community of wealth owners requires in order to absorb the existing stock of capital into its portfolio. Deviations of the supply price of capital from the marginal productivity of capital were found to stimulate the sort of responses expected from Tobin's articles. The many time series constructed and drawn together for this investigation are described in appendix A. Chapter 3 analyses trends in the portfolios of the three groups listed above. Theoretical considerations, data limitations and institutional details are combined in chapter 4 to produce a macroeconomic model comprising 60 equations including 27 identities. The equations of principal interest in the model are estimated by two stage least squares as described in chapter 5. Because not all equations were estimated the overall specification and properties of the model cannot be comprehensively evaluated. Particular attention is given in the estimation procedure to the balance sheet requirement, that total assets equal total liabilities at all times. Chapters 6 and 7 present, respectively, the estimation results and conclusions...|$|E

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, job losses and wage erosion in {{developed}} countries have sparked opposition to offshoring. Experts argue {{that the quality of}} any new jobs {{in developed countries}} are less than the jobs lost and offer lower pay. Economists against offshoring charge that currency manipulation by governments and their central banks causes the difference in labor cost creating an illusion of comparative advantage. Further, they point out that even more educated highly trained workers with higher-value jobs such as software engineers, accountants, radiologists, and journalists in the developed world have been displaced by highly educated and cheaper workers from India and China. On May 1, 2002, Economist and former Ambassador Ernest H. Preeg testified before the Senate committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs that China, for instance, pegs its currency to the dollar at a sub-par value in violation of Article IV of the International <b>Monetary</b> Fund <b>Articles</b> of Agreement which state that no nation shall manipulate its currency to gain a market advantage.|$|R

Despite a long and rockyhistory with financial crisis, Americans continue to look forquick fix solutions instead of preparing for long-termfinancial success. In 2007 prior to the credit crunch, theBank for International Settlements (an organization thatfosters cooperation between central banks) warned thatyears of loose monetary policies could lead to another 1930 sslump; as the regulations of free-market, greed, power,inequality, and quick fix solutions ends in a bust (Levinson, 2009). “The Fall of the House of the Lehman Brothers”(Fraser, 2008, p. 3), {{one of the oldest}} banks in the UnitedStates on Wall Street in the 1980 ’s, provides a perfectexample of how the regulation of free-market, greed, power,inequality, and quick fix solutions contaminatespartnerships and corporate businesses.

40|$|Inflation {{expectations}} play {{an important}} role in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. There is a risk that the periods of above-target CPI inflation in the past three years might cause inflation expectations to drift upwards. That might make inflation itself more persistent, via changes in price and wage-setting behaviour. And so, other things being equal, returning inflation to target would require tighter <b>monetary</b> policy. This <b>article</b> provides a framework that can be used to monitor the risk to inflation from inflation expectations. While recent developments provide few signs that the risk is materialising, the imperfect nature of data mean that the risk can be assessed only imperfectly. ...|$|R

The International <b>monetary</b> Fund held <b>Article</b> IV consultations (periodic country evaluations) in 1996, 1997, and in August 1999. After the 1999 consultations, IMF directors stressed the need for Equatorial Guinea to establish greater fiscal discipline, accountability, and more transparent management of public sector resources, especially energy sector revenue. IMF officials also have emphasized the need for economic data. In 1999, the Equato-Guinean Government began attempting to meet IMF-imposed requirements, maintaining contact with IMF and the World Bank representatives. However, the newfound oil wealth allowed the government to avoid improving fiscal discipline, transparency and accountability.|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{literature}} on optimal monetary policy uses models in which the degree of nominal price flexibility is exogenous. There are, however, good reasons to suppose that the degree of price flexibility adjusts endogenously to changes in <b>monetary</b> conditions. This <b>article</b> extends the standard new Keynesian model to incorporate an endogenous degree of price flexibility. The model shows that endogenizing the degree of price flexibility tends to shift optimal monetary policy towards complete inflation stabilization, even when shocks take the form of cost-push disturbances. This contrasts with the standard result obtained in models with exogenous price flexibility, which show that optimal monetary policy should allow some degree of inflation volatility to stabilize the welfare-relevant output gap.

This <b>article</b> puts the focus on the European Central Bank (ECB). We test the hypothesis that the ECB's change of concept in 2003 (money in the background) paved the way to follow the Fed's overly expansionary monetary policy. We also discuss if policy should be geared to financial market stability. In contrast to the Greenspan-Bernanke-Mishkin view, some modest leaning against the bubble is supported. Finally, the ECB's response to the crisis is evaluated. Cheap long-run jumbo loans and reduced security standards are potentially dangerous.
