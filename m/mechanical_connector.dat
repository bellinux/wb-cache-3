30|$|Researchers seldom {{study the}} optimum {{design of a}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>connector</b> for subsea oil-gas {{pipeline}} based upon the sealing performance. An optimal design method of a novel subsea pipeline <b>mechanical</b> <b>connector</b> is presented. By analyzing the static metal sealing mechanism, the critical condition of the sealing performance is established for this connector and the formulation method of the contact pressure on the sealing surface is created. By the method the minimum mean contact pressure of the 8.625 inch connector is calculated as 361 MPa, which is the constraint condition in the optimum design of connector. The finite element model is created in ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL) and the structure is optimized by the zero-order method, with variance of contact pressure as the objective function, and mean contact pressures and plastic strains as constraint variables. The optimization shows that variances of contact pressure on two sealing surfaces decrease by 72.41 % and 89.33 %, respectively, and mean contact pressures increase by 31.18 % and 52.84 %, respectively. The comparison of the optimal connectors and non-optimal connectors in the water pressure experiments and bending experiments shows that the sealing ability of optimized connectors {{is much higher than}} the rated pressure of 4.5 MPa, and the optimal connectors don’t leak under the bending moment of 52.2 kN·m.

ISA enables vastly different spacecraft architectures and emplacement scenarios to be achieved, including optimal launch configurations ranging from single launch and assembly to on-orbit aggregation of multiple launches at different orbital locations and times.

Recently, Space Systems Loral (SSL) led a study funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), called Dragonfly, to investigate the commercial applicability and economic advantages of ISA. In the study, it was shown that ISA enables SSL to double the capability of a commercial satellite system by taking advantage of alternate packaging approaches for the reflectors.

In this research paper, the shear buckling response of glass shear walls is assessed by means of Finite-Element (FE) simulations and analytical methods. The role of (i) linear adhesive joints, (ii) metal frames with interposed adhesive joints or (iii) point <b>mechanical</b> <b>connectors</b> on the theoretical buckling resistance of these panels is first assessed (e. g. in the form of fundamental buckling shapes and Euler’s critical loads). Analytical fitting curves of general applicability are proposed, so that classical formulations derived from shear buckling theories could be used.

This goal is achieved by means of accurate but computationally efficient FE models able to reproduce (via <b>mechanical</b> <b>connectors,</b> surface-to-surface interactions, etc.) the desired mechanical effect of restraints, as well as any possible local damage in them.

MethodsThe anastomotic device is a connector consisting of a bare-metal stent with spikes covering its outer surface, which is introduced through the prosthesis. The seal of the anastomosis is obtained by inflating a balloon anchoring the stent with the spikes in the prosthesis and in the receiving artery. This experiment was conducted in three phases: (1) A feasibility study was done on four cadaveric femoral arteries using a polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis, with measurement of the penetration of the spikes into the layers of the arterial wall. (2) Bench tests were conducted in seven automated and in seven sutured anastomoses. Anastomosis sealing was tested using a pump system (≤ 250 mm Hg) in a water-filled closed circuit. (3) The infrarenal aorta of seven pigs was replaced with a 6 - to 8 -mm diameter prosthesis, using this automated device for the proximal anastomosis. The distal anastomosis was handsewn on the aortic bifurcation. After completion angiography, animals were euthanized for macroscopic and histologic studies of the aorta, connector, and prosthesis. Explantations were done immediately (2 pigs), and at 15 (2 pigs), at 30 (2 pigs), and 42 days (1 pig). Study end points were the automated anastomosis time compared with manual suturing, leakage, mechanical strength, and patency of the anastomosis together with the histologic changes of the aortic wall {{in contact with the}} spiked stent. ResultsTests performed on four cadaveric arteries showed complete penetration of the spikes into the arterial wall layers without metal fracture. Tests of traction showed that the median force needed to rupture the automated anastomosis was 18. 3 N (interquartile range [IQR], 17. 7 - 19. 9 N), with no significant difference from the handmade anastomosis (19. 5 N; IQR, 17. 9 - 20. 2 N, P =. 33). No leakage was demonstrated in vitro with a pulsatile flow and a pressure up to 250 mm Hg. The median automated anastomosis time on pig aorta was 2. 4 minutes (IQR, 1. 4 - 3. 3 min) vs 17. 0 minutes (IQR, 15. 1 - 17. 2 minutes) for the handmade aortic anastomosis performed on the same animals (P =. 002). There was no anastomotic leak. Histology showed incorporation of the connector spikes in the aortic wall, without intimal hyperplasia or false aneurysm. ConclusionsThis preliminary study confirms the feasibility of this sutureless system, suggesting its usefulness for a faster and simpler anastomosis in hybrid arterial surgery. Clinical RelevanceAutomated anastomotic devices are used routinely in gastrointestinal and in thoracic surgery but not in vascular surgery for bypass grafting. This study reports the preliminary results of a novel <b>mechanical</b> <b>connector</b> for sutureless arterial anastomosis that was developed to facilitate the construction of the aortic anastomosis when doing laparoscopic aortic revascularization or when performing an arterial anastomosis in a small confined space through a mini-laparotomy. This experimental study found that this sutureless anastomotic device using a bare spiked stent was safe, quick and easy to use with comparable tensile strength between handsewn and automated anastomoses. Future potential clinical application for hybrid arterial procedures using this device will need more experimental work to confirm its durability...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{experimental and}} numerical seismic analyses of typical connections and wall systems used in cross-laminated (X-Lam) timber buildings. An extended experimental programme on typical X-Lam connections was performed at IVALSA Trees and Timber Institute. In addition, cyclic tests were also {{carried out on}} full-scale single and coupled X-Lam wall panels with different configurations and <b>mechanical</b> <b>connectors</b> subjected to lateral force. An advanced non-linear hysteretic spring to describe accurately the cyclic behaviour of connections was implemented in ABAQUS finite element software package as an external subroutine. The FE model with the springs calibrated on single connection tests was then used to reproduce numerically the behaviour of X-Lam wall panels, {{and the results were}} compared with the outcomes of experimental full-scale tests carried out at IVALSA. The developed model is suitable for evaluating dissipated energy and seismic vulnerability of X-Lam structures...|$|R
40|$|Needleless connectors, {{including}} the standard split septum and the luer-activated <b>mechanical</b> valve <b>connectors,</b> {{have been introduced}} into clinical practice to eliminate the risk of needlestick injuries by avoiding the use of needles when accessing the intravascular catheters. Negative and positive displacement mechanical valves {{have been associated with}} increased rates of catheter-related bloodstream infections as compared with split septum connectors. Based on available data, split septum connectors should be preferentially used instead of mechanical valves. Adequate disinfection by scrubbing the access port preferably with chlorhexidine is recommended to minimize the risk of catheter microbial contamination along with proper infection control practices. Large prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate further the possible causes and effects of different types of <b>mechanical</b> valve needleless <b>connectors</b> on bloodstream infections.

50|$|VMEbus (Versa Module Europa bus) is a {{computer}} bus standard, originally developed for the Motorola 68000 line of CPUs, but later widely used for many applications and standardized by the IEC as ANSI/IEEE 1014-1987. It is physically based on Eurocard sizes, <b>mechanicals</b> and <b>connectors</b> (DIN 41612), but uses its own signalling system, which Eurocard does not define. It was first developed in 1981 and continues to see widespread use today.|$|R
