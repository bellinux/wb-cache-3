5|$|In August 2011, {{as part of}} the European Union Training Mission Somalia (EUTM Somalia), 900 Somali {{soldiers}} {{graduated from}} the Bihanga Military Training School in the Ibanda District of Uganda. 150 personnel from the EU took part in the training process, which trained around 2,000 Somali troops per year. In May 2012, 603 Somali army personnel completed training at the facility. They were the third batch of Somali nationals to be trained there under the auspices of EUTM Somalia. In total, the EU mission had trained 3,600 Somali soldiers, before permanently transferring all of its advisory, <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> training activities to Mogadishu in December 2013.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Existing online mentorship systems {{typically}} match <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> mentees manually. Recommender {{systems can}} be used to match <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> mentees and trust and reputation mechanisms {{can be used to}} improve the decision process. This paper discusses the state-of-the-art in online mentorship systems, recommender systems, and trust and reputation mechanisms. It further proposes a five-stage process for automatic matching groups of <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> mentees in online mentorship systems...|$|R

50|$|The {{frequency}} with which peer <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> mentees meet varies according to the particular mentoring program. Some pairs may make contact once a month, while others may meet 3-4 times per month or more. It is usually advised that <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> mentees meet more often {{in the beginning of}} the relationship in order to establish a good foundation. <b>Mentors</b> <b>and</b> mentees may maintain contact through email, telephone or in-person meetings. Peer mentoring organizations may also set up social events for those participating in the program.

40|$|National Board-certified (NBC) {{teachers}} {{are recognized as}} accomplished teachers who have met the National Board 2 ̆ 7 s stringent standards. These {{teachers are}} encouraged to serve as mentors to novice teachers and veteran teachers in candidacy for National Board Certification. This study identified and compared the career <b>and</b> psychosocial <b>mentoring</b> functions that NBC teacher <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> non-NBC teacher <b>mentors</b> perceived they provided to their protÃ©gÃ©s 2 ̆ 7 at the elementary grade levels. National Board-certified protÃ©gÃ©s 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of having the functions provided were {{compared with those of}} their teacher <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> with the protÃ©gÃ©s 2 ̆ 7 of non-NBC teacher mentors. The research was conducted in a large urban school district in Florida and included 190 participants: 95 <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> their protÃ©gÃ©s 2 ̆ 7. The teacher mentors 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of having provided the mentoring functions were assessed using the Mentoring Functions Scale for the <b>Mentor,</b> <b>and</b> the protÃ©gÃ©s 2 ̆ 7 perceptions were measured with the Mentoring Functions Scale for the ProtÃ©gÃ©. Both instruments were adapted for this study from a previous mentoring scale for the protÃ©gÃ© developed by Noe (1988). Results for the study indicated no statistically significant differences between the NBC teacher <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> the non-NBC teacher mentors in their perceptions of having provided the functions. Significant differences were found between NBC teacher <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> their protÃ©gÃ©s on the exposure-and-visibility function, between non-NBC teacher <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> their protÃ©gÃ©s on the challenging assignments function, <b>and</b> between all <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> all protÃ©gÃ©s on the challenging assignments function. Implications for teacher <b>mentors,</b> administrators, <b>and</b> scholars are provided. These include developing or updating existing mentoring programs to include the career and psychosocial functions studied in this research, providing <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> protÃ©gÃ©s with information about the functions in order to assess the existence of specific functions, expanding professional development time to address functions that may have been inadequate, and possibly limiting the number of protÃ©gÃ©s with whom teacher <b>mentors</b> interact <b>and</b> guide...|$|R

25|$|The First and Second Battles of Kakarak (16 March– 12 April 2009) were fought {{near the}} village of Kakarak in the West Dorafshan {{district}} of Orūzgān Province, in southern Afghanistan. The fighting took place between Australian forces from the 1st <b>Mentoring</b> <b>and</b> Reconstruction Task Force (MRTF-1) and Taliban fighters, with the area considered {{to be one of the}} last Taliban outposts in the area. During the first action on the morning of 16 March a six-man Australian Operational <b>Mentoring</b> <b>and</b> Liaison Team (OMLT) operating with Afghan National Army (ANA) troops was contacted by a numerically superior Taliban force {{near the village}}.

40|$|This {{review of}} the {{research}} literature focuses on the interconnectedness of the roles of <b>mentor</b> teachers <b>and</b> pre-service teachers. In order to examine the interconnectedness of <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> mentees, the paper firstly delves into what <b>mentoring</b> is <b>and</b> what contextual factors influence mentoring in pre-service teacher education. It then examines the research literature on <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> mentees and the roles they undertake in a mentoring relationship. Emerging from {{the examination of the}} roles is identification of how the relationship functions with regard to the <b>mentor</b> <b>and</b> mentee who work together to achieve specific goals. The paper highlights the fact that limited research has examined <b>mentor</b> <b>and</b> mentees as interconnected partners in mentoring relationships. The paper outlines how the mentoring relationship participants can actively participate and interact. In conclusion, the paper provides a definition for mentoring that embraces essential mentoring components for pre-service teacher education contexts...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide a {{comprehensive}} and descriptive study of the Oregon Mentorship Program. The study examined literature on adult mentorship programs particularly related to education and educational administration, <b>and</b> gathered <b>mentor</b> <b>and</b> protege perceptions on the personal and professional usefulness of program activities and characteristics. The analysis of the data may provide guidance for future formal mentorship programs designed to prepare better beginning administrators in the field of education. Data were gathered utilizing a questionnaire. All participants in the program (77 <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> 79 proteges) were surveyed with an instrument designed around the follow-up study model. Statistical analyses of the data were based upon 55 <b>mentor</b> <b>and</b> 57 protege respondents. Chi square, mean, t-test, and Kendall 2 ̆ 7 s coefficient of concordance were used to determine significant differences among <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> proteges. Two qualitative methodologies of analysis, phenomenology and development of a category system for analysis which seeks convergence and divergence were also applied to the responses. Major findings of this study were grouped as perceptions, structure, logistics, participant relationships, <b>and</b> demographic. <b>Mentors</b> <b>and</b> proteges had few differences in the way they perceived the mentorship program. <b>Mentors</b> <b>and</b> proteges did not agree on the significance of same/different gender mentor/protege pairings. Age differential between <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> proteges was also not found to be a significant factor. Structurally, proteges more than mentors felt that directives and guidelines were unsatisfactory. Proteges did not agree that satisfactory year-long goals were established. Logistically, proteges were more likely to come to mentors than mentors to proteges. No significant differences existed in any of the items concerning the participant relationship category: <b>mentors</b> <b>and</b> proteges responded in similar ways to each of the questions. The study recommended future actions to enhance the Oregon Mentorship Program and made recommendations for further research into formal mentorship programs...|$|R
