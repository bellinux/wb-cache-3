5|$|Compulsory {{education}} or grunnskóli (lit. “basic school”), is {{the period of}} education which is compulsory for all. The legislation concerning compulsory education was passed in 2007, and in 1996 municipalities took over the running of compulsory education. It comprises primary and lower secondary education, which often {{takes place at the}} same institution. The law states that education is <b>mandatory</b> <b>for</b> children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 16. The school year lasts nine months, and begins between August 21 and September 1, ending between May 31 and June 10. The minimum number of school days is 170, but after a new teachers’ wage contract, this will increase to 180. Lessons take place five days a week.|$|E
5|$|Each town in {{the colony}} was {{considered}} a single church congregation; in later years, {{some of the larger}} towns split into two or three congregations. Church attendance was <b>mandatory</b> <b>for</b> all residents of the colony, while church membership was restricted to those who had converted to the faith. In Plymouth Colony, it seems that a simple profession of faith was all that was required for acceptance. This was a more liberal doctrine than some other New England congregations, such as those of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where it was common to subject those seeking formal membership to strict and detailed cross-examinations. There was no central governing body for the churches. Each individual congregation was left to determine its own standards of membership, hire its own ministers, and conduct its own business.|$|E
5|$|In large cities, a {{majority}} of working people and students eat their lunch at a corporate or school cafeteria, which normally serve complete meals as described above; it is not usual for students to bring their own lunch food. For companies that do not operate a cafeteria, it is <b>mandatory</b> <b>for</b> white-collar workers to be given lunch vouchers {{as part of their}} employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and traiteurs; however, workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three dishes of a traditional lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among blue-collar workers, eating sandwiches followed with a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets for budget prices.|$|E

5|$|Justices are {{appointed}} to {{a term that}} could potentially last for ten years. Once a new justice is chosen, he may serve {{for two years before}} being subjected to a retention election held during the first statewide election following the completion of the justice's second year in office. The justice is listed on the ballot with the option to be retained or to be rejected from the Court. If retained, the justice may serve the remainder of his ten-year term. When a term is completed, the justice must be reappointed with the same process originally used to appoint him to remain on the Court. A majority vote of both houses of the Indiana General Assembly may impeach a justice for misconduct. It is <b>mandatory</b> <b>for</b> a justice to retire at age seventy-five, even if their term is incomplete.|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{while the}} rest of Europe saw revolutionary uprisings, the Swiss drew up a {{constitution}} which provided for a federal layout, much of it inspired by the American example. This constitution provided for a central authority while leaving the cantons the right to self-government on local issues. Giving credit to those who favoured the power of the cantons (the Sonderbund Kantone), the national assembly was divided between an upper house (the Council of States, two representatives per canton) and a lower house (the National Council, with representatives elected from across the country). Referendums were made <b>mandatory</b> <b>for</b> any amendment of this constitution. This new constitution also brought a legal end to nobility in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Gerard van Swieten, whom Maria Theresa had {{recruited}} {{following the}} death of her sister, Archduchess Maria Anna, founded the Vienna General Hospital, revamped Austria's educational system and served as the Empress's personal physician. After calling in van Swieten, Maria Theresa asked him to study the problem of infant mortality in Austria. Following his recommendation, she made a decree that autopsies would be <b>mandatory</b> <b>for</b> all hospital deaths in the city of Graz, Austria's second largest city. This law – still in effect today – combined with the relatively stable population of Graz, resulted {{in one of the most}} important and complete autopsy records in the world. Maria Theresa banned the creation of new burial grounds without prior government permission, thus countering wasteful and unhygienic burial customs. Her decision to have her children inoculated after the smallpox epidemic of 1767 was responsible for changing Austrian physicians' negative view of inoculation. The empress herself inaugurated inoculation in Austria by hosting a dinner for the first sixty-five inoculated children in Schönbrunn Palace, waiting on the children herself.|$|E
