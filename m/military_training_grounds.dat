5|$|Bounded on each {{sides by}} <b>military</b> <b>training</b> <b>grounds,</b> the I-80 {{corridor}} is overflown by commercial airliners traveling west from Salt Lake City International Airport. The freeway veers north around the Cedar Mountains {{in a small}} gap {{between them and the}} Lakeside Mountains. Further east, the highway passes the Stansbury Mountains, which are located in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest. After the mountain ranges, the freeway arrives at the southern shore of the Great Salt Lake and closely follows the shore towards the western suburbs of Salt Lake City. However, the historical routes from which the route of I-80 was derived were routed further from the lake, passing through the towns of Grantsville and Tooele before crossing a bottleneck between the Oquirrh Mountains and Stansbury Island in the Great Salt Lake. These communities are now served by SR-138 and SR-36 respectively.|$|E
500|$|Parts of the 1st Panzer Division were {{relocated}} via Arras, Cambrai and Hirson to Rethel on 2 June. The {{second phase}} of the Battle of France, Fall Rot (Case Red), was about to begin and Strachwitz returned to his Panzer-Regiment 2 where he again organized the replenishment of the troops. The 1st Panzer Division flanked on the right by the 2nd Panzer Division and the XXXXI. Armeekorps (motorized) on the left, was ordered to cross the Aisne River breaching the French defences and head south. The first main objective was the Canal du Rhine au Marne which was roughly [...] away. The French defenders of the Weygand Line, named after Maxime Weygand, had built strong defences, running parallel to the Aisne and Aisne Canal. The German attack began on 5 June with Heeresgruppe B (Army Group B), under the command of Generaloberst (Colonel General) Fedor von Bock, attacking between the Channel coast and the Aisne. Heeresgruppe A (Army Group A), under Generaloberst Gerd von Rundstedt, to which the 1st Panzer Division was subordinated, was held back until 9 June. Strachwitz in the meantime had been awarded the Clasp to the Iron Cross 1st Class on 6 June for his daring [...] "solo runs". The two regiments of the 1st Panzer Division cross the Aisne on the night of 9/10 June 1940. The two regiments advanced quickly to Neuflize and Juniville, where they were engaged in combat with French tanks. The advance proceeded along La Neuveville to Bétheniville and Saint-Hilaire-le-Petit. The <b>military</b> <b>training</b> <b>grounds</b> at Mourmelon-le-Grand was captured on 12 June. The fortress Langres surrendered to Panzer-Regiment 2 on 15 June and Besançon the following day. The final objective was Belfort, which capitulated after a short resistance. This ended the Battle of France for Strachwitz's regiment. Panzer-Regiment 2 was then stationed at Doubs until 3 July 1940, it was then relocated to Saint Denis, north of Paris, from 3–8 July.|$|E
2500|$|Canada {{came to be}} at {{war when}} in 1914 King George V {{declared}} that the British Empire was at war with its German counterpart. At the time, Canada had in Ottawa a royal viceroy {{in the form of}} Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn; though well intended, the Prince donned his Field Marshal's uniform and, without ministerial advice, went to <b>military</b> <b>training</b> <b>grounds</b> and barracks to address the troops and see them off on their voyage to Europe. This was much to the chagrin of the prime minister at the time, Robert Borden, who saw the Governor General as overstepping constitutional conventions. Though Borden blamed the military secretary of the day, Edward Stanton, he also opined that Prince Arthur [...] "laboured under the handicap of his position {{as a member of the}} Royal Family and never realised his limitations as Governor General." [...] Arthur's wife, Princess Louise Margaret, Duchess of Connaught, also helped in the war effort, forming volunteer groups to make supplies for Canadian soldiers overseas; for Christmas in 1915, she sent a card and a box of maple sugar to every Canadian serving in Europe and she had a knitting machine installed at Rideau Hall, on which she made thousands of pairs of socks for soldiers. Princess Patricia, the Connaughts' daughter, became so active with the military that Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry was in 1914 named in her honour; the Princess personally chose the infantry's colours, designed its badge, and was appointed as its colonel-in-chief at the cessation of hostilities in 1918.|$|E
