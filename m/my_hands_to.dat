500|$|Rutherford's {{confrontation}} with four Watch Tower Society directors who opposed him in 1917 highlighted both the forcefulness {{of his personality}} and his determination to fight for what he believed was right. Penton claims Rutherford played [...] "hard-fisted church politics" [...] and Rogerson accuses Rutherford of using The Watchtower as a propaganda medium to attack his opposers in what was effectively a battle for his position as president. At {{the heart of his}} opponents' complaints was his [...] "autocratic" [...] behavior as he strove to [...] "exercise complete management of the Society and its affairs." [...] Penton similarly describes Rutherford's actions in his first year of presidency—including his appointment of new directors, refusal to allow the Society's accounts to be examined, and his unilateral decision to publish The Finished Mystery—as high-handed and secretive. In contrast, Rutherford claimed, [...] "It was my duty to use the power the Lord had put into <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> support the interests of the shareholders and all others interested in the Truth throughout the world ... to be unfaithful to them would be unfaithful to the Lord." [...] Macmillan, who supported Rutherford throughout the crisis, claimed the president was extremely patient and [...] "did everything that he could to help his opposers see their mistake, holding a number of meetings with them, trying to reason with them and show them how contrary their course was to the Society's charter".|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{interpreted}} {{the words of}} [...] "A man's pride shall bring him low; but he that is of a lowly spirit shall attain to honor," [...] to apply to Pharaoh and Moses, respectively. The Midrash taught that the words, [...] "A man's pride shall bring him low," [...] apply to Pharaoh, who in [...] haughtily asked, [...] "Who is the Lord that I should hearken to His voice?" [...] and so, as [...] reports, God [...] "overthrew Pharaoh and his host." [...] And the Midrash taught that the words, [...] "but he that is of a lowly spirit shall attain to honor," [...] apply to Moses, who in [...] ( [...] in the KJV), humbly asked Pharaoh, [...] "Have this glory over me; at what time shall I entreat for you [...] [...] [...] that the frogs be destroyed," [...] and was rewarded in [...] {{with the opportunity to}} say, [...] "As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread forth <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> the Lord [...] the thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail." ...|$|E

2500|$|In another article, Fitzpatrick told of {{his work}} with a student who had been [...] "horribly crippled" [...] from birth. [...] The student asked to be excused from the {{compulsory}} gymnasium work, claiming it would be [...] "utterly impossible" [...] for him to participate. The student had never walked a step, his legs were twisted out of shape, {{and he could not}} control his head and neck. Fitzpatrick denied the request and promised the young man: [...] "I will teach you to walk." [...] Fitzpatrick invented exercises to strengthen every part of the student's body, until eventually the student could walk on his own. Fitzpatrick recalled:"Day after day I taught him. [...] I showed him how to step and helped him with <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> take steps. The first two steps he took alone were followed by tears of joy. Of course, he'll never be able to walk as an able-bodied man, but he learned to discard his shuffle. ... This is but an instance of gymnasium work's benefits. If people realized the value of physical culture, we would be a splendidly developed race of men and women." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Grieve {{said the}} {{avalanche}} was initiated by a climber who dislodged a huge sheet of snow, sending {{it down on}} the nine other climbers who were swept [...] downhill. The climber avoided being swept away by digging into the mountain with his ice axe before he composed himself to alert the emergency services. The surviving climbers had begun to unearth their friends' bodies from the snow with their ice axes by the time the rescue team had arrived. Fifty-year-old Jim Coyne from Lindsayfield, East Kilbride, said he and 53-year-old David Barr from Paisley, were on the mountain when a slab of snow came away from the peak. Barr sustained the shoulder injury. Coyne told of how they were just below the summit when the avalanche occurred, describing it as [...] "massive" [...] and saying they were ... engulfed and I managed to dig my way out. As I tried to get my bearings I saw an arm sticking out of the snow. It was Davie. I dug for 10 minutes using just <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> get him free. 54-year-old Tom Richardson, an experienced climber from Sheffield in England, also had a narrow escape and subsequently alerted the emergency services.|$|E
