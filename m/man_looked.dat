500|$|The {{original}} Leigh Court was an Elizabethan mansion {{built by}} Sir George Norton. His great-great-grandson, also George Norton (born 1622), unknowingly hosted Charles II, who {{arrived at the}} house the evening of 12 September 1651, during his escape to France following the Battle of Worcester. The Nortons were friends of the Kings's travelling companion, Jane Lane. The Nortons were unaware of the King's identity during his three-day stay. While staying at Leigh Court and after being recognised by the elderly butler, who had served the King when a young Prince at Richmond, Charles deflected suspicion by asking a trooper, {{who had been in}} the King's personal guard, to describe the King's appearance and clothing at the Battle of Worcester. The <b>man</b> <b>looked</b> at Charles and said, [...] "The King was at least three inches taller than you."

500|$|Later {{reviews of}} the episode tended to see the {{installment}} in a more positive light. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their 2009 book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode fourstars out of five. They stated that the installment [...] "kicks off the seventh season with great style", becoming a [...] "rallying cry for {{the last leg of}} the race". The two enjoyed its [...] "real passion", which they felt mythology-heavy episodes usually lacked. In 2012, Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club rated the episode a [...] "B", but criticized the writing, calling it [...] "very purple prose" [...] and Carter's most [...] "overwrought script since the glory days of 'The Blessing Way'." [...] He was also critical of the [...] "absolutely atrocious" [...] make-up used to transform Duchovny into an old man. Notwithstanding his negativity towards the writing, plot, and make-up, VanDerWerff said that he truly [...] "enjoy both halves of 'The Sixth Extinction' all the same" [...] despite calling it [...] "entertainingly bad [...] ludicrously over-the-top". He complimented the scene in which The Smoking <b>Man</b> <b>looked</b> out onto the alien apocalypse, deeming it a [...] "pretty impressive TV effects accomplishment".|$|E

The next morning they travelled on to Chipping Sodbury and then to Bristol, arriving at Abbots Leigh {{on the evening of}} 12 September. They stayed at the home of Mr and Mrs George Norton, who were also Janeâ€™s friends. The Nortons were unaware of the King's identity during his three-day stay at Abbotsleigh. While staying there Charles deflected suspicion by asking a servant, {{who had been in the}} King's personal guard at the Battle of Worcester, to describe the King's appearance and clothing at the battle.

2500|$|In 1988, Santa Claus {{had three}} tiny, poorly {{maintained}} A-frame buildings painted to represent peppermint candies. American writer Mark Winegardner described Santa Claus {{at that time}} as being on its last legs. Additionally, Winegardner noted in his 1988 book Elvis Presley Boulevard: From Sea to Shining Sea, Almost, that"Styrofoam silver bells, strands of burned-out Christmas lights and faded plastic likenesses of Old Saint Nick garnished this little village. A lopsided, artificial twenty-foot tree whistled in the wind beside a broken Coke machine and an empty ice freezer. Two of the three buildings were padlocked; through their windows, encrusted with layers of sand and decade-old aerosol snow, ... I saw dusty, overturned fiberglass statuettes of elves and reindeer. Alongside the SANTA CLAUS, ARIZONA/ESTABLISHED 1937 sign was another: FOR SALE BY OWNER/$52,500/INQUIRE AT GIFTSHOP. An arrow pointed the way.""The gift shop stocked no seasonal items. Its shelves were littered with flea-market [...] at antique-shop prices. Battered paperbacks cost a buck. What little money the place generated must {{have come from the}} short-ordered grill and the soft-drinks cooler.

2500|$|On June 6, 2002, ABC's World News Tonight {{broadcast}} {{an interview}} with Johnelle Bryant, former loan officer at the U.S. Department of Agriculture in south Florida, who told about her encounter with Mohamed Atta. This encounter took place [...] "around {{the third week of}} April to the third week of May of 2000", before Atta's official entry date into the United States (see below). According to Bryant, Atta wanted to finance the purchase of a crop-duster. [...] "He wanted to finance a twin-engine, six-passenger aircraft and remove the seats," [...] Bryant told ABC's World News Tonight. He insisted that she write his name as ATTA, that he originally was from Egypt but had moved to Afghanistan, that he was an engineer and that his dream was to go to a flight school. He asked about the Pentagon and the White House. He said he wanted to visit the World Trade Center and asked Bryant about the security there. He mentioned Al Qaeda and said the organization [...] "could use memberships from Americans". He mentioned Osama bin Laden and said [...] "this man would someday be known as the world's greatest leader." [...] Bryant said [...] "the picture that came out in the newspaper, that's exactly what that <b>man</b> <b>looked</b> like." [...] Bryant contacted the authorities after recognising Atta in news reports. Law-enforcement officials said Bryant passed a lie-detector exam.|$|E

2500|$|Late in {{the first}} day, when [...] was {{finishing}} his first journey across the sky, one of the hermaphrodite twins, , stopped breathing. [...] Afraid, the people left her alone. [...] In the morning, the Coyote named First Angry and the people went to find the twin, but [...] was gone. [...] One <b>man</b> <b>looked</b> down the reed into the Third World, and there he saw [...] sitting {{by the side of}} the river combing her hair. [...] He called to his friend, and he looked and also saw her. [...] The people asked Coyote what to do. [...] He took a black rock, , and threw it into , the Black Water Lake. [...] He said that if the rock came up and floated, the spirit of the dead person would return to the Fourth World and there would be no death. [...] If the rock sank, the spirit would stay in the world below and there would be death. The rock sank, and the people knew then that the twin was dead, and First Man remembered the agreement they had made with the sun. [...] Four days later the two witnesses who had looked down on the dead twin also died. [...] The people learned that it is dangerous to look at the dead. The people were all mad at Coyote for this and gathered around to beat him. Coyote said they could beat him, but first he had something to say. [...] "I threw the rock in the water knowing that it would sink." [...] The people darkly muttered about this to one another, the whole of them deciding that Coyote really did deserve a good beating. But quick thinking Coyote finished his explanation. [...] "Without death the world would soon be overpopulated. The elders would never die and would stay stuck in their infirm bodies. There would be no room for new children. We would run out of food and shelter with so many people to feed and care for." [...] The gathered group was silent for a bit while all of them contemplated Coyote's rationale and found him to be wise and intelligent.|$|E
