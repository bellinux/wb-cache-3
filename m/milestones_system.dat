40|$|Abstract Background The early drug {{discovery}} phase in pharmaceutical {{research and development}} {{marks the beginning of}} a long, complex and costly process of bringing a new molecular entity to market. As such, it plays a critical role in helping to maintain a robust downstream clinical development pipeline. Despite its importance, however, to our knowledge there are no published in silico models to simulate the progression of discrete virtual projects through a discovery <b>milestone</b> <b>system.</b> Results Multiple variables were tested and their impact on productivity metrics examined. Simulations predict that there is an optimum number of scientists for a given {{drug discovery}} portfolio, beyond which output in the form of preclinical candidates per year will remain flat. The model further predicts that the frequency of compounds to successfully pass the candidate selection milestone as a function of time will be irregular, with projects entering preclinical development in clusters marked by periods of low apparent productivity. Conclusions The model may be useful as a tool to facilitate analysis of historical growth and achievement over time, help gauge current working group progress against future performance expectations, and provide the basis for dialogue regarding working group best practices and resource deployment strategies. </p...|$|R
50|$|<b>Milestone</b> <b>Systems</b> {{was founded}} in 1998 to build a {{software}} development company that could improve business through managing and distributing digital video data regardless of time or location. Co-founders Henrik Friborg and John Blem saw that their experience in developing IP technology for real-time data systems in the European financial sector could also {{be applied to the}} handling of video images. With that mindset the first Milestone VMS is launched in 1999. At that time, digital video technology was not in use in the security surveillance industry. The security market back then was mainly operating with proprietary analogue equipment, and the digital share of sales grew slowly at first. This gradual pace allowed Milestone to grow organically, without the need for external funding. From the beginning and throughout its maturing phases, the company has stayed independent and entirely self-funded with very healthy growth rates. To fuel the commercial development of the organization, more like-minded professionals were hired. CEO Lars Thinggaard and a sales team of account managers, top software system architects, expert support staff, marketing and technical documentation talent were included in Milestone team.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} video {{demonstration}} of an agent-based test bed application for ongoing research into multi-user, multimodal, computer-assisted meetings. The system tracks a two person scheduling meeting: one person {{standing at a}} touch sensitive whiteboard creating a Gantt chart, while another person looks on in view of a calibrated stereo camera. The stereo camera performs real-time, untethered, vision-based tracking of the onlooker’s head, torso and limb movements, which in turn are routed to a 3 D-gesture recognition agent. Using speech, 3 D deictic gesture and 2 D object de-referencing the system is able to track the onlooker’s suggestion to move a specific <b>milestone.</b> The <b>system</b> also has a speech recognition agent capable of recognizing out-ofvocabulary (OOV) words as phonetic sequences. Thus when a user at the whiteboard speaks an OOV label name for a chart constituent while also writing it, the OOV speech is combined with letter sequences hypothesized by the handwriting recognizer to yield an orthography, pronunciation and semantics for the new label. These are then learned dynamically by the system and become immediately available for future recognition...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes novel {{secret key}} {{generation}} techniques using memristor devices. The approach depends on using the initial {{profile of a}} memristor as a master key. In addition, session keys are generated using the master key and other specified parameters. In contrast to existing memristor-based security approaches, the proposed development is cost effective and power efficient since the operation can be achieved with a single device rather than a crossbar structure. An algorithm is suggested and demonstrated using physics based Matlab model. It is shown that the generated keys can have dynamic size which provides perfect security. Moreover, the proposed encryption and decryption technique using the memristor based generated keys outperforms Triple Data Encryption Standard (3 DES) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in terms of processing time. This paper is enriched by providing characterization results of a fabricated microscale Al/TiO 2 /Al memristor prototype {{in order to prove}} the concept of the proposed approach and study the impacts of process variations.

40|$|Abstract Ideally, a {{software}} project commences with requirements gathering and specification, reaches its major <b>milestone</b> with <b>system</b> implementation and delivery, and then continues, possibly indefinitely, into an {{operation and maintenance}} phase. The software system’s architecture {{is in many ways}} the linchpin of this process: {{it is supposed to be}} an effective reification of the system’s technical requirements and to be faithfully reflected in the system’s implementation. Furthermore, the architecture is meant to guide system evolution, while also being updated in the process. However, in reality developers frequently deviate from the architecture, causing architectural erosion, a phenomenon in which the initial, “as documented ” architecture of an application is (arbitrarily) modified to the point where its key properties no longer hold. Architectural recovery is a process frequently used to cope with architectural erosion whereby the current, “as implemented ” architecture of {{a software}} system is extracted from the system’s implementation. In this paper we propose a light-weight approach to architectural recovery, called Focus, which has three unique facets. First, Focus uses a system’s evolution requirements to isolate and incrementally recover only the fragment of the system’s architecture affected by the evolution. In this manner, Focu...|$|R
