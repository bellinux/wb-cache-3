5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are thought}} to be preyed upon by large owls, such as the <b>Madagascar</b> <b>owl</b> (Asio madagascariensis), and snakes like the Malagasy tree boa (Sanzinia madagascariensis). In one case, a family of fork-marked lemurs {{exhibited}} mobbing behavior when they encountered a Malagasy tree boa. Diurnal raptors, such as the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) and Madagascar cuckoo-hawk (Aviceda madagascariensis) hunt these lemurs at dusk, and the hunting behavior of the Madagascar harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) suggests it might extract them from their sleeping holes. The fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) has also been seen attacking fork-marked lemurs, and remains have been found in their scat.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{of giant}} mouse lemurs include the Madagascar buzzard, <b>Madagascar</b> <b>owl,</b> fossa, and the narrow-striped mongoose. Giant mouse lemurs {{reproduce}} once a year, with two offspring born after a 90-day gestation. Babies are initially {{left in the}} nest while the mother forages, but are later carried by mouth and parked in vegetation while she forages nearby. In captivity, giant mouse lemurs will breed year-round. Their lifespan in the wild {{is thought to be}} five to six years. Both species are listed as endangered due to habitat destruction and hunting. Like all lemurs, they are protected under CITES Appendix I, which prohibits commercial trade. Despite breeding easily, they are rarely kept in captivity. The Duke Lemur Center coordinated the captive breeding of an imported collection of the northern species, which rose from six individuals in 1982 to 62individuals by 1989, but the population fell to six by 2009 and was no longer considered a breeding population.|$|E
50|$|The Karthala {{scops owl}} was {{formerly}} {{considered to be}} a subspecies of the <b>Madagascar</b> scops <b>owl</b> Otus rutilus, but with the other Comoro Islands scops owls it is now regarded as a separate species.|$|R
50|$|The Pemba {{scops owl}} was {{formerly}} {{regarded as a}} subspecies of the <b>Madagascar</b> scops <b>owl</b> Otus rutilus sensu lato due to morphological similarities but genetic {{research has shown that}} it is closer to the clade in which the African scops owl Otus senegalensis is situated.|$|R
50|$|The red owl (Tyto soumagnei) is an owl in {{the barn}} owl family Tytonidae. It {{is also known as}} the <b>Madagascar</b> red <b>owl,</b> <b>Madagascar</b> grass-owl and Soumange's owl. It is a rare {{resident}} of Madagascar that was virtually unknown from its discovery in 1876 to its rediscovery by researchers from the World Wide Fund for Nature in 1993. It is currently listed as vulnerable because of habitat loss, but recent studies have determined it may have a wider range than believed, though further research in distribution and ecology is required. It has possibly been overlooked because of its close resemblance to the closely related barn owl.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Madagascar</b> <b>owl</b> (Asio madagascariensis), {{also known}} as the Madagascar long-eared owl, is a medium sized owl endemic to the island of Madagascar. It is {{sometimes}} considered to be conspecific with the long-eared owl (Asio otus.) ...|$|E

50|$|The large-eared tenrec {{feeds on}} insects, {{particularly}} termites which it locates by sound. It is itself preyed on by several predators including the barn owl (Tyto alba), the <b>Madagascar</b> <b>owl</b> (Asio madagascariensis), the Malagasy cat-eye snake (Madagascarophis colubrinus) and the narrow-striped mongoose (Mungotictis decemlineata).|$|E
50|$|The {{rainforest}} {{scops owl}} (Otus rutilus), {{also known as}} the Malagasy scops <b>owl</b> or <b>Madagascar</b> scops <b>owl,</b> is a species of owl in the family Strigidae. It is found in a large part of eastern Madagascar, but the exact distribution limits between it and the Torotoroka scops owl (O. madagascariensis), with which it was long considered conspecific, require further study.|$|R
50|$|The Torotoroka {{scops owl}} (Otus madagascariensis) is a taxon of owl {{in the family}} Strigidae. It is endemic to Madagascar, and was {{previously}} regarded as its own species. However, O. madagascariensis and the rainforest scops owl Otus. rutilus have now been re-lumped following Fuchs et al. (2007) as the <b>Madagascar</b> scops <b>owl</b> or Malagasy scops owl. The scientific name of the combined species {{is yet to be}} agreed, although rutilus would appear to be have priority.|$|R
50|$|Some {{bird species}} {{commonly}} seen are the hook-billed vanga, Madagascar pygmy kingfisher, crested coua, white-breasted mesite and Madagascar ibis. Raptors sighted in the reserve include the Madagascar harrier-hawk and the <b>Madagascar</b> scops <b>owl.</b> Other avafauna occurring here include red-capped coua and Coquerel's coua, and the vangas Van Dam's vanga, rufous vanga and sickle-billed vanga. Vangas are significant in Madagascar, as 15 of the 16 vanga species are endemic to Madagascar. The greater vasa parrot and Madagascar green pigeon are also indigenous. An important endangered species, the Madagascar fish eagle, {{has a number}} of breeding pairs located in the Ankarana Reserve.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Madagascar</b> <b>owl</b> is {{endemic to}} Madagascar {{where it is}} {{widespread}} {{in the west and}} centre of the island. It is generally found at elevations ranging from sea level to 1600 m, though it occasionally ranges as high as 1800 m. It inhabits a variety of woodland habitats, mainly in the drier western forests, although it appears quite adaptable, and also occurs in degraded habitats, even on the central plateau where the forest cover has been fragmented.|$|E
50|$|Like most owls, the <b>Madagascar</b> <b>owl</b> is nocturnal, {{roosting}} by day {{in dense}} foliage. It feeds mainly on small mammals, hunting {{either in the}} forest or in open areas nearby. Pellets collected from a roost site in south eastern Madagascar were examined and contained the remains of insects; frogs (Boophis); geckoes (Uroplatus), birds (broad-billed roller and Malagasy bulbul); rodents, including tufted-tailed rats (Eliurus spp);and black rat Rattus rattus); Commerson's leaf-nosed bats (Hipposideros commersoni); and dwarf lemurs (Microcebus spp).|$|E

2500|$|The park is {{habitat for}} 112 bird species, 46 reptile species, 62 species of {{amphibians}} and 48 species of mammals, including 13 species of lemurs. The ethnic groups inhabiting {{the area are}} mostly Betsimisaraka and Sihanak. The most prominent faunal species in the park are: Indri indri (babakoto), a black lemur with white patches; the <b>Madagascar</b> red <b>owl</b> (Tyto soumagnei), [...] locally known as vorondolomena; the katsatsaka (Paroedura masobe), a small gecko; the Madagascar serpent eagle (Eutriorchis astur), a threatened species; and the red-tailed newtonia (Newtonia fanovanae), a very common bird species in the park. The two most prominent endemic floral species are Marattia boivinii (kobila) and Blotella coursii (fanjana malemy).|$|R
50|$|The Torotoroka {{scops owl}}, the Mayotte scops owl Otus mayottensis, the Pemba scops owl Otus pembaensis and the {{rainforest}} scops owl Otus rutilus have all previously been lumped as one species. The taxonomy is {{in state of}} flux but recent genetic studies have placed the Pemba scops owl closer to the clade containing the African scops owl Otus sengalensis, while the Mayotte scops owl is clearly separate from the remaining two. The status of the rainforest and Torotoroka scops owls as separate species is debatable as there may be very little genetic distance between the two taxa and subsequent {{studies have suggested that}} the plumage differences between rutilus and madgascarensis are small and that their voices intergrade. If that is the case then the rainforest and Torotoroka scops owls become subspecies of the <b>Madagascar</b> scops <b>owl.</b>|$|R
500|$|The most {{significant}} predators {{of the gray}} mouse lemur are the <b>Madagascar</b> long-eared <b>owl</b> and barn owl. [...] Studies conducted in Beza Mahafaly Reserve and Kirindy Mitea National Park indicate a predation rate of around 25% (percent population taken by predators per year), the highest known for any primate species. [...] However, given the species' high reproductive potential, predation {{does not appear to}} have a drastic effect on its populations. [...] Other raptors, such as Henst's goshawk and other owls, also prey upon this species. Snakes, such as Ithycyphus miniatus (a native colubrid snake) and the Madagascar tree boa, as well as mammalian predators, such as the ring-tailed mongoose, narrow-striped mongoose, fossa, and domestic dogs are also known to prey on the gray mouse lemur. [...] Mammalian predators often discover tree holes serving as nests, and enlarge the opening so they can catch and eat the occupant. This puts strong selective pressure on the choice of nest hole opening diameter and deepness.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Madagascar</b> <b>owl</b> {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the Holarctic long-eared owl in that it sits tall and at rest shows prominent ear tufts. The plumage is mainly brown with darker streaks and bars. It has distinctive bright orange eyes. The adults are brown above, and mottled with buff, especially across the mantle. The face is plain dark buff, with a darker brown feathers around the eyes, {{on the edge of}} the facial disc, and on the ear tufts. The underparts are light brown with darker brown streaks which fade away towards the vent. The juvenile is covered in white down contrasting with a black facial disk and dark brown wings. It ranges from 40 - 50 cm in length, making it the largest of the country's owls; females are larger than males.|$|E
