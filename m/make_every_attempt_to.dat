These stars are also not like the Sun {{because they are not}} main sequence stars. From the descriptions in the novel it is assumed that they are protostars nearing their inevitable collapse. The constant phase shift of light on K-PAX and the lack of light made it necessary to evolve the ability to detect shorter wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, i.e., ultraviolet. This explains prot's need to wear his sunglasses in all but very dim conditions. In the book, when Prot is questioned as to why a K-PAXian appears human on Earth, he responds, [...] "Why is a soap bubble round?" [...] He explains that K-PAXians appear human because the humanoid form is the most efficient shape to explore the planet. The method of reproduction of the dremers (prot's species, a term used in the book), unlike human sexual intercourse, is considered extremely unpleasant, due to intense feelings of pain and horrible smells, among other unpleasant sensations. Prot is completely uninterested in flirtation. Prot can age to a thousand years, like his parents, who are in their late six-hundreds. Prot's age contributes to his knowledge base, and on Earth, prot is considered a savant, although it is never specified whether dremer intelligence is inherent or a result of K-PAXian society. Prot makes it clear that dremers <b>make</b> <b>every</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> improve and disseminate their understanding of truth. Prot ultimately communicates that sentient beings on K-PAX have such a universal awareness of life that it would seem a majority of human endeavor is benign, but he is excited for us because our race has a bright future if only we disregard our primitive misconceptions of our surroundings.|$|E
50|$|The film YMCA Baseball takes places {{after these}} events have {{occurred}} and Japan has occupied Korea as a protectorate state of Japan. The Japanese have a highly invested interest in maintaining control of Korea and <b>make</b> <b>every</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> prohibit any inkling of resistance or possibility of uprising by the Korean people as portrayed {{by the film}} although somewhat overly exuberant. Korea’s future lay uncertain and coincided with national sentiment of oppression towards the Japanese. With the Chosun dynasty ending and large western and other foreign influence there were two sentiments shared among the Korea people. Korea could either modernize or {{go back to the}} traditional ways of its historic past. Westerners and Japanese had made settlements in Korea; Missionary schools and military outposts respectively, and took full advantage of the fact Korea {{was in the midst of}} the twilight of its greatest dynasty, the Chosen. With the West to traveling and settling Asia, western culture and customs spread in turn. As the film’s title states, YMCA baseball was a part of this divergence. George Williams founded the YMCA on June 6, 1844, in London, England; YMCA is an acronym for Young Men’s Christian Association that began among evangelists. Known for its promotion of sports, it was actually also a missionary organization in conjunction with the Church and run locally and this would most likely have been encouraged even as far away as Korea. Baseball was first introduced in Korea in 1905 by Phillip L. Gillett, a missionary who introduced the sport to members of a YMCA in Seoul. Western missionaries of the YMCA colluded with the Japanese to abolish traditional Korean values and indoctrinate Korean youths to Japanese values and customs. This led many Koreans to study in Tokyo and this is represented by a few characters in the film. Indoctrination of the youth would steer Korea in the direction of modernization; Japan had been undergoing a surge of industrial production and western adoption and the West had already gone through several phases of industrialization. By subverting the youth of Korea to fall in line with more modern and foreign sentiments, in a way ensured the future relations with Korea and the inevitable outcome of this is a struggle between traditional Korean culture and values, and that of new influence. The remark about the Japanese first encountering baseball some thirty years earlier however, was accurate (1872).|$|E

40|$|In this Article, I suggest two {{different}} but related ways of reframing the public discourse on climate change. First, I propose that we move {{further in the}} direction of characterizing climate change as a public health threat and not only as an environmental threat. Second, I argue that we should stop thinking of responses to climate change in terms of the precautionary principle, which counsels action {{even in the absence of}} scientific consensus about a threat. We should speak instead in terms of a ?post-cautionary? principle for a post-cautionary world, in which some very bad effects of climate change are unavoidable and others are avoidable only if we take dramatic steps, and soon. These points are related insofar as they together create a moral imperative both to adapt to the changes we cannot prevent and to mitigate those we can.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{several examples}} of projects with potential for enhancing environmental improvement {{aside from the}} traditional growthoriented objectives. For instance, if an integrated pest management (IPM) component can be included in an irrigation project, it can bring environmental benefits other than increased agricultural production. Irrigation projects are traditionally considered as economic growth-oriented projects with increased agricultural output as the objective. With the introduction of IPM systems to an irrigation project, it can (i) increase inland fish production, (ii) bring benefits of reduced cost for agro-chemicals, (iii) improve water quality in the area, and (iv) improve nutritional status of the rural poor. These additional benefits can be complementary to the traditional benefits (i. e., increased agricultural production) of the project. This chapter focuses on the improvement of project design through the incorporation of environmental enhancement components to traditional or growth-oriented projects. For additional consideration see Box 8. I. Three Possible Scenarios Not every project/intervention, however, is always capable of bringing these kinds of positive environmental impacts. In principle there can be three types of project interventions: (i) win-win situations, (ii) trade-off situations, and (iii) worse-off situations.

Additionally important is the need to understand the experience of all involved in the process. The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to achieve a better understanding, from the perspective of the preceptor, of the experience of being the primary nurse preceptor for newly graduated nurses during their transition into clinical practice. A qualitative research design with a phenomenological method of inquiry guided by the work of Max van Manen and Patricia Munhall was used. Following Colaizzi 2 ̆ 7 s seven stages of data analysis, an overall essence, three main themes, and nine sub-themes revealed the meaning of being a primary nurse preceptor for newly graduated nurses during their transition into clinical practice, as an altruistic responsibility to the greater good of the profession. Understanding the meaning of being the primary preceptor for newly graduated nurses during their transition into clinical practice has significant implications for hospital administrators, nursing leaders, and nurses involved in staff development roles. Organizations should pay particular attention to whether preceptors are being expected to fulfill other roles, such as that of charge nurse, while they are precepting newly graduated nurses. Also important is the need for preceptors to be involved in the entire orientation process and the use of a systematic approach to match preceptors with preceptees. Preceptors should have opportunities to share their perspectives of preceptee characteristics that both contribute to and interfere with optimal transition experiences. Finally, time should be invested in the professional development of preceptors and mechanisms should be put in place to support them in their day-to-day preceptor practice...|$|E
