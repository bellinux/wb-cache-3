5|$|The Bolton Wanderers club badge {{consists}} of the initials of the club {{in the shape of}} a ball, with a red scroll and Lancashire rose underneath. The current badge is a reimagining of one designed in 1975; this was replaced in 2001 by a badge which retained the recognisable initials but controversially exchanged the scroll and rose for blue and red ribbons. The re-design has been welcomed by fans who saw the ribbons as a poor choice. The original club badge was the town crest of Bolton, a key feature of which was the Elephant and Castle motif with the town motto – Supera <b>Moras.</b> This feature has been reincorporated into more recent club shirts.|$|E
5|$|The {{methods for}} {{creating}} poetic rhythm vary across languages and between poetic traditions. Languages are {{often described as}} having timing set primarily by accents, syllables, or <b>moras,</b> depending on how rhythm is established, though a language can be influenced by multiple approaches. Japanese is a mora-timed language. Syllable-timed languages include Latin, Catalan, French, Leonese, Galician and Spanish. English, Russian and, generally, German are stress-timed languages. Varying intonation also affects how rhythm is perceived. Languages can rely on either pitch, such as in Vedic Sanskrit or Ancient Greek, or tone. Tonal languages include Chinese, Vietnamese and most Subsaharan languages.|$|E

50|$|Vowel {{length is}} nonphonemic, and changes {{according}} to the vowel's place within the word. The vowels can exhibit vowel lengths of less than a <b>mora,</b> one <b>mora,</b> or 1.5-2 <b>morae.</b> The vowel is less than one <b>mora</b> in unstressed syllables, around one <b>mora</b> in closed stressed syllables, {{and more than one}} <b>mora</b> in open stressed syllables.|$|R
50|$|According to one analysis, tones {{are carried}} on <b>morae.</b> In Luganda, a short vowel has one <b>mora</b> {{and a long}} vowel has two <b>morae.</b> A geminate or prenasalised {{consonant}} has one <b>mora.</b> A consonant + semivowel (e.g. gw or ly) also has one <b>mora.</b> A vowel followed by a prenasalised consonant has two <b>morae</b> including the one belonging to the prenasalised consonant. The initial vowel of words like ekitabo 'book' is considered to have one <b>mora,</b> even though such vowels are often pronounced long. No syllable can have more than two <b>morae.</b>|$|R
5|$|The blackmouth {{catshark}} is an active, generalist predator that feeds on both bottom-dwelling and free-swimming organisms. Its diet {{is dominated by}} decapods, krill, bony fishes (including lanternfishes, bristlemouths, dragonfishes, and <b>moras),</b> and cephalopods. The most significant prey species generally reflect what is most available in the environment, for example the shrimps Calocaris macandreae and Pasiphaea multidentata off southern France and the prawns Sergestes arcticus and Sergia robusta off the Iberian Peninsula. Juveniles consume a greater amount and variety of crustaceans than adults, including smaller types such as mysids and hyperiid amphipods. Adults favor relatively large fish prey and {{have been known to}} take other sharks and rays and smaller members of the same species. The importance of cephalopod prey across ages differs between regions. The stomachs of some {{blackmouth catshark}}s have found to contain pieces of animals too large for a single shark to overwhelm, suggesting that it may sometimes attack in groups. Scavenging has been infrequently documented, including of human refuse.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, in 1980, {{geologist}} Walter Alvarez and his father, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Luis Walter Alvarez, put forth his hypothesis {{that a large}} extraterrestrial body had struck Earth. In 1981, unaware of Penfield's discovery, University of Arizona graduate student Alan R. Hildebrand and faculty adviser William V. Boynton published a draft Earth-impact theory and sought a candidate crater. Their evidence included greenish-brown clay with surplus iridium containing shocked quartz grains and small weathered glass beads that looked to be tektites. Thick, jumbled deposits of coarse rock fragments were also present, {{thought to have been}} scoured from one place and deposited elsewhere by a megatsunami resulting from an Earth impact. Such deposits occur in many locations but seem concentrated in the Caribbean basin at the K–Pg boundary. So when Haitian professor Florentine <b>Morás</b> discovered what he thought to be evidence of an ancient volcano on Haiti, Hildebrand suggested it could be a telltale feature of a nearby impact. Tests on samples retrieved from the K–Pg boundary revealed more tektite glass, formed only in the heat of asteroid impacts and high-yield nuclear detonations.|$|E

25|$|Word {{stress is}} {{predictable}} in Hawaiian for words {{with three or}} fewer <b>moras</b> (that is, three or fewer vowels, with diphthongs and long vowels counting as two vowels). In such cases, stress {{is always on the}} penultimate mora. Longer words will also follow this pattern, but may in addition have a second stressed syllable which is not predictable. In Hawaiian, a stressed syllable is louder in volume, longer in duration and higher in pitch.|$|E

5000|$|The {{rules of}} accent {{are based on}} the concept of <b>mora.</b> In the context of Ancient Greek accent, a <b>mora</b> is a {{measurement}} of vowel length. A short vowel has one <b>mora,</b> and a long vowel has two <b>morae.</b> A diphthong usually counts as a long vowel and has two <b>morae,</b> {{but at the end of}} a word the diphthongs [...] and [...] can sometimes count as one <b>mora.</b> In most noun or verb endings they have one <b>mora,</b> but two <b>morae</b> in the optative and locative. Here are the main categories of vowels, first in Greek, then in IPA, and finally in IPA with each <b>mora</b> written as a separate vowel letter: ...|$|R
50|$|In Ancient Greek, one <b>mora</b> in a {{word was}} accented. A <b>mora</b> was accented by being {{pronounced}} at a higher pitch than other <b>morae.</b> A vowel of one <b>mora</b> could have accent or no accent; a vowel of two <b>morae</b> could have accent on its first <b>mora,</b> last <b>mora,</b> or be unaccented. These possibilities translate to two possible pitch patterns on a one-mora vowel, and three on a two-mora vowel. These pitch patterns are shown below in the International Phonetic Alphabet. High pitch is marked with an acute accent.|$|R

500|$|Archbishop of Bangalore Archdiocese Bernard <b>Moras</b> {{rejected}} the Somasekhara report, stating, [...] "It {{has failed to}} address the terms of reference of the Commission and has failed {{to do justice to}} the Christian community." [...] He demanded that the state government launch a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the attacks, also saying that [...] "we will make a representation to the government putting forth our demand. We will make a representation to the chief minister, the governor, various organisations including the Human Rights and the Central government". Bajrang Dal State convener Suryanarayana also disputed the veracity of the Somasekhara report in its statements about the Bajrang Dal involvement and former Bajrang Dal state convener Mahendra Kumar. He issued a statement saying that [...] "Bajrang Dal had no role to play in the incidents of attacks on churches and the statement given by Mr. Kumar during the attacks in 2008 were his personal views and the organisation had clarified this aspect then. However, Uday Kumar Shetty, the president of the district unit of the BJP, approved of the report, believing that the report was correct in its assertion that the Sangh Parivar were not involved in the attacks.|$|E
500|$|The Bishop of Mangalore Diocese Aloysius Paul D'Souza {{stated that}} Christians were [...] "deeply hurt" [...] over the desecration of the Holy Cross and Sacred Sacrament in the Adoration monastery.

[...] Fr. William Menezes, the public relations officer of the Mangalore Diocese, said: [...] "After consulting various leaders and based on the assurance given by Chief Minister B. S. Yeddyurappa, district in-charge Minister J. Krishna Palemar, the police and district administration, we hereby appeal to our community to stop agitation immediately to maintain peace." [...] Fr. Prashant Madtha, former principal of St. Aloysius College said in response to the attacks and resultant protests, [...] "The retaliation from the Christian community you saw was happening for the very first time in the history of the state. It was not the correct response, I condemn it, but then our youth have started imitating the enemy. There is a lot of fear. We don't know when the stones will rain on our roofs. We are even scared to talk." [...] Fr. Joseph Valiaparambil, Bishop of Belthangady, also said that Christian community of Belthangady was deeply hurt and shocked at the attacks, saying that [...] "We strongly condemn the act. We are not violent and do not believe in violence. We respect the administration and the law of the country. We respect all religions. We, the Christian minority community, need protection from kinds of anti-social, anti-religious activities". The community leaders in a press conference also appealed internationally, stating [...] "we want to bring to the notice of the world and human right commissions and authorities in Canada to use their diplomatic channels about the total collapse of law and order in Mangalore and other parts of India, and the failure of the state to protect the lives of the clergy and the minority community".|$|E

50|$|These rules can {{be derived}} from a single rule: the <b>morae</b> between the accented <b>mora</b> and the last <b>mora</b> cannot belong to {{different}} syllables. This rule is shown below by placing the IPA transcription of a word in a table. Here the accented <b>mora</b> and the final <b>mora</b> are placed in two different columns, and the middle <b>morae</b> between the two are placed in the column between them. Syllables before the accent are irrelevant to the rule.|$|R
2500|$|Stress is {{typically}} {{within the last}} four vowels of a word, with long vowels and diphthongs counting double. That is, on the last four <b>moras.</b> However, stressed <b>moras</b> are longer than unstressed <b>moras,</b> so the word {{does not have the}} precision in Māori that it does in some other languages. It falls preferentially on the first long vowel, on the first diphthong if there is no long vowel (though for some speakers never a final diphthong), and on the first syllable otherwise. [...] Compound words (such as names) may have a stressed syllable in each component word. [...] In long sentences, the final syllable before a pause may have a stress in preference to the normal stressed syllable.|$|E

2500|$|In some {{systems of}} romanization for the Japanese, the {{apostrophe}} is used between <b>moras</b> in ambiguous situations, to differentiate between, for example, na and n+a. (This {{is similar to}} the practice in Pinyin mentioned above.) ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{a common}} belief that mora enters the room through the keyhole, sits on the chest of the {{sleepers}} and tries to strangle them (hence moriti, [...] "to torture", [...] "to bother", [...] "to strangle"). To repel <b>moras,</b> children are advised {{to look at the}} window or to turn the pillow and make a sign of cross on it (prekrstiti jastuk); in the early 19th century, Vuk Karadžić mentions that people would repel <b>moras</b> by leaving a broom upside down behind the door, or putting their belt on top of their sheets, or saying an elaborate prayer poem before they go to sleep.|$|E
