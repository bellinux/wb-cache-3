"One Minute" [...] is an {{alternative}} rock song with electropop influences, and begins with Clarkson singing, [...] "You're going crazy, running on empty / You can't <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> / You try to hide it, {{but you had to}} say it / Restless all this time." [...] It is composed in the key of A major and is set in time signature of common time, with a tempo of 124 beats per minute. Clarkson's vocal range spans over an octave, from A3 to D5. Critics have observed the influence of 1980s music on the song, while Talia Kraines of BBC Music compared it to pop rock songs released by singers Ashlee Simpson and Lindsay Lohan. A reviewer for Billboard commented on the song's structure, writing that [...] "One Minute" [...] consists of [...] "rapid-fire give-and-take verses".|$|E
500|$|This hypothesis, {{although}} not perfect, perhaps best explains the evidence. Eighteen {{months prior to}} an October 1984 conference on lunar origins, Bill Hartmann, Roger Phillips, and Jeff Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists: [...] "You have eighteen months. Go back to your Apollo data, {{go back to your}} computer, do whatever you have to, but <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind.</b> Don't come to our conference unless you {{have something to say about}} the Moon's birth." [...] At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most popular. Before the conference, there were partisans of the three [...] "traditional" [...] theories, plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously, and there was a huge apathetic middle who didnâ€™t think the debate would ever be resolved. Afterward there were essentially only two groups: the giant impact camp and the agnostics.|$|E
500|$|Dodd {{contributed to}} several films in which issues facing Indigenous Australians, such as land rights and race relations, were the central subjects. These {{appearances}} included Bitter Springs (mentioned above) and The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1978), {{the first of}} two films in which he appeared alongside Jack Thompson. Dodd played the character of Tabidgi, the uncle of the lead character, Aboriginal man Jimmie Blacksmith. In the film, Jimmie Blacksmith marries a white woman named Gilda Marshall (played by Angela Punch McGregor). When they have a baby, Dodd's character, [...] "a tribal elder,... is worried about Jimmie's marriage to a white woman and has brought him a talisman to keep him safe". Pauline Kael, writing in The New Yorker, described the performances of the two black professional actors (Jack Charles and Dodd) as [...] "wonderful as sots:... Steve Dodds , who is tried for murder and simply says, 'You'd think it would take a good while to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> to kill someone and then to kill them, but take my word for it, it only takes a second'".|$|E

2500|$|Frumious: Combination of [...] "fuming" [...] and [...] "furious". In Hunting of the Snark Carroll comments, [...] "ake the {{two words}} 'fuming' and 'furious'. <b>Make</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> that you will say both words, but leave it {{unsettled}} which you will say first. Now open your mouth and speak. If your thoughts incline ever so little towards 'fuming', you will say 'fuming-furious'; if they turn, by even a hair's breadth, towards 'furious', you will say 'furious-fuming'; {{but if you have}} the rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will say 'frumious'." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{technique}} {{attributed to}} Sigmund Freud {{to help in}} making difficult decisions is to toss a coin not actually to determine the decision, but to clarify the decision-maker's feelings. He explained: [...] "I did not say you should follow blindly what the coin tells you. What I {{want you to do}} is to note what the coin indicates. Then look into your own reactions. Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? That will help you to recognize how you really feel about the matter, deep down inside. With that as a basis, you'll then be ready to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> and come to the right decision." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Jaka's Story", {{a tragic}} {{character}} study dealing with gender roles {{and the political}} suppression of art, is generally cited as the series' pinnacle of narrative achievement. Later issues of the series became highly personal and began to alienate many long-time fans, his female readers especially. Issue #186 (collected in Reads) contained a lengthy prose section that was attacked by some readers and critics for what they perceived as overt misogyny, but which Sim describes as [...] "anti-feminism". During {{this part of the}} story, the storyline consisted of a textual treatise written by Viktor Davis, a fictional [...] "reads" [...] author, interspersed with the main Cerebus storyline. [...] In Davis' material, he refers to the [...] "creative male light" [...] and the [...] "emotional female void", a reversal of the gender-based view of creation espoused by the Judge at the end of Church and State (namely, the [...] "female light" [...] being raped by the [...] "male void" [...] and shattering into the physical universe). As Sim himself says in an interview with The Comics Journal, [...] "Cerebus #1-200 [...] the completion of the story. The yin and yang. The ultra-female reading. The ultra-male reading. I'm attaching an allegory to the Big Bang. You <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> which one's the pit and which one's the top of the mountain." [...] By the end of the series, the Void is again male and identified as God, and the Light is female, now identified with YHWH. Issue #186 was followed by an even harsher essay in the back of issue #265 called [...] "Tangent", in which Sim identified a [...] "feminist/homosexualist axis" [...] that opposed traditional and rational societal values. [...] This material appeared as Sim was retreating from public life and becoming more marginalized by his peers in the industry.|$|E
