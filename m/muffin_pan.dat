5000|$|In {{the year}} of her recognition, Charming created a {{newspaper}} style seasonal menu meant to be stolen, introduced the first classy Bourbon Street [...] "go" [...] drink made with fresh ingredients, offered a 12 local draft beer flight served in a <b>muffin</b> <b>pan,</b> and glued magnets on top of bitters bottle caps to store them on a metal tray (on the ceiling) above the wells.|$|E
40|$|Research on the {{efficiency}} of silicone bakeware is limited. Manufacturers claim that silicone bakeware is nonstick, has easy product release and even heat distribution. This study attempted to replicate consumer baking conditions through a comparison of muffins baked in silicone <b>pans</b> to <b>muffins</b> baked in nonstick, anodized aluminum dark-colored metal pans (‘nonsilicone’). Using a consumer corn-muffin mix, structured baking procedures and controlled tests were performed, such as measures of the top surface browning, texture, water activity and heat transfer coefficient of the pans. The results of the tests indicated that silicone <b>muffin</b> <b>pans</b> did not produce a better product; rather, they were moister, had greater volume, with top-crust texture and color significantly less than muffins baked in nonsilicone <b>muffin</b> <b>pans...</b>|$|R
50|$|Sheet {{aluminium}} is spun or stamped into form. Due to {{the softness}} of the metal it may be alloyed with magnesium, copper, or bronze to increase its strength. Sheet aluminium is commonly used for baking sheets, pie plates, and cake or <b>muffin</b> <b>pans.</b> Deep or shallow pots may be formed from sheet aluminium.|$|R
50|$|The {{kitchen is}} {{supplied}} with dishes, cutlery, utensils, {{pots and pans}} and bake ware (including roasting pans, cookie sheets, bread <b>pans</b> and <b>muffin</b> <b>pans).</b> There is a full size propane oven, {{as well as some}} two-burner propane stoves for cooking. The hut is lit by several propane lights. Propane is supplied by the Alpine Club via a large outdoor tank.|$|R
50|$|Muffin tins and <b>muffin</b> <b>pans</b> are {{typically}} metal bakeware which has round bowl-shaped depressions into which muffin batter is poured. <b>Muffin</b> tins or <b>pans</b> can be greased with butter or cooking spray, {{to lessen the}} issue of batter sticking to the <b>pan.</b> Alternatively, <b>muffin</b> cups or cases are used. Cups or cases are usually round sheets of paper, foil, or silicone with scallop-pressed edges, giving the muffin a round cup shape. They {{are used in the}} baking of muffins to line the bottoms of muffin tins, to facilitate the easy removal of the finished muffin from the tin. The advantage to cooks is easier removal and cleanup, more precise form, and moister muffins; however, using them will prevent a crust from forming.|$|R
50|$|The {{kitchen is}} well {{supplied}} with dishes, cutlery, utensils, {{pots and pans}} and bake ware (including roasting pans, cookie sheets, coffee percolator, bread <b>pans</b> and <b>muffin</b> <b>pans).</b> There is a full size propane oven, {{as well as some}} two-burner propane stoves for cooking. Propane is supplied by the Alpine Club via a large outdoor tank. Drinking water is available from a small stream fed by Kiwetinok lake (a day hike) running through the meadow 60 m south of the hut. It is advisable to boil or treat the water before drinking it. In the winter you can dig down to the creek or melt snow for water.|$|R
5000|$|Dollar Monthly Magazine in 1864 {{states that}} muffin rings were used with griddles. First the griddle was heated and greased with pork fat.An 1861 article states {{that once the}} yeast-based dough was prepared, it was molded, allowed to sit for a while, and then placed in buttered muffin rings which {{were placed on the}} griddle. [...] Godey's Lady's Book and Magazine states that the muffins and rings were turned over with a thin tool {{resembling}} a palette knife. The American author Parloa states that <b>muffin</b> <b>pans,</b> cups or tins should be used rather than muffin rings, since at the time she was writing, muffin rings had faded in popularity.|$|R
5000|$|Packed frozen, pelmeni can {{be found}} in Russian and Ukrainian food stores, as well as {{everywhere}} Russian communities exist. Packets of frozen pelmeni are usually labeled [...] "Siberian pelmeni" [...] because of the Siberian practice of storing and transporting pelmeni in frozen form. Store-bought pelmeni are made on industrial machinery, much of which is made by Italian companies such as Arienti and Cattaneo, Ima, Ostoni, Zamboni, etc. These pelmeni usually weigh around 15 grams (½ oz) each and look like a larger version of tortellini, which is why, for industrial production, Italian pasta machines are commonly used. Pelmeni are also commonly made at home. The easiest (if somewhat laborious) way is simply to make them by hand; many cooks use specialized [...] "pelmeni makers" [...] (пельменница), which are essentially molds that resemble <b>muffin</b> <b>pans</b> or ravioli molds, allowing one to quickly make a few dozen pelmeni out of two sheets of dough and a quantity of ground meat.|$|R
5000|$|Cupcakes {{are usually}} baked in <b>muffin</b> tins. These <b>pans</b> {{are most often}} made from metal, {{with or without a}} {{non-stick}} surface, and generally have six or twelve depressions or [...] "cups". They may also be made from stoneware, silicone rubber, or other materials. A standard size cup is 3 in in diameter and holds about 4 oz, although pans for both miniature and jumbo size cupcakes exist. Specialty pans may offer many different sizes and shapes.|$|R
5000|$|The Star Tribune wrote a mixed review, criticizing it for {{utilizing}} vignettes {{while also}} encouraging viewers {{to support the}} flawed lead heroine while laughing at her unbearable dates. However they also stated that while the film did not match up to female oriented films like Bridesmaids, it was also [...] "tolerably funny" [...] and deserved a B for effort. A reviewer for Chicagoist <b>panned</b> <b>Muffin</b> Top and included it in their [...] "worst of the year" [...] list, writing [...] "Made with obvious good intentions, the indie comedy Muffin Top: A Love Story has little else going for it. Its basic plea for women to not allow their self-esteem to be damaged by unrealistic, media-enforced notions of an ideal body is a welcome message. Unfortunately, it is delivered via a frequently irritating and laugh-free feature made almost bearable by some talented cast members." ...|$|R
