5|$|Many <b>millipede</b> {{species have}} {{commensal}} relationships with mites of the orders Mesostigmata and Astigmata. Many of these mites {{are believed to}} be phoretic rather than parasitic, which means that they use the <b>millipede</b> host as a means of dispersal.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{appear in}} {{folklore}} and traditional medicine around the world. Some cultures associate <b>millipede</b> activity with coming rains. In the Yoruba culture of Nigeria, millipedes {{are used in}} pregnancy and business rituals, and crushed millipedes are used to treat fever, whitlow, and convulsion in children. In Zambia, smashed <b>millipede</b> pulp is used to treat wounds, and the Bafia people of Cameroon use <b>millipede</b> juice to treat earache. In certain Himalayan Bhotiya tribes, dry <b>millipede</b> smoke is used to treat haemorrhoids. Native people in Malaysia use <b>millipede</b> secretions in poison-tipped arrows. The secretions of Spirobolus bungii have been observed to inhibit division of human cancer cells. The only recorded usage of millipedes as food by humans comes from the Bobo people of Burkina Faso, who consume boiled, dried millipedes in tomato sauce.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 12,000 <b>millipede</b> {{species have}} been described. Estimates of the true number of species on earth range from 15,000 to as high as 80,000. Few species of <b>millipede</b> are at all widespread; they have very poor {{dispersal}} abilities, depending as they do on terrestrial locomotion and humid habitats. These factors have favoured genetic isolation and rapid speciation, producing many lineages with restricted ranges.|$|E
5|$|The living {{members of}} the Diplopoda are divided into sixteen orders in two {{subclass}}es. The basal subclass Penicillata contains a single order, Polyxenida (bristle <b>millipedes).</b> All other <b>millipedes</b> belong to the subclass Chilognatha consisting of two infraclasses: Pentazonia, containing the short-bodied pill <b>millipedes,</b> and Helminthomorpha (worm-like <b>millipedes),</b> containing {{the great majority of}} the species.|$|R
50|$|Euphoberiidae is an extinct {{family of}} archipolypodan <b>millipedes</b> {{known from the}} Upper Pennsylvanian of Europe and North America. The family {{includes}} relatively large <b>millipedes</b> measuring up to 30 cm long bearing distinctive spines and were the dominant <b>millipedes</b> of the Pennsylvanian.|$|R
5|$|<b>Millipedes</b> are preyed on by a {{wide range}} of animals, {{including}} various reptiles, amphibians, birds, mammals, and insects. Mammalian predators such as coatis and meerkats roll captured <b>millipedes</b> on the ground to deplete and rub off their defensive secretions before consuming their prey, and certain poison dart frogs are believed to incorporate the toxic compounds of <b>millipedes</b> into their own defences. Several invertebrates have specialised behaviours or structures to feed on <b>millipedes,</b> including larval glowworm beetles, Probolomyrmex ants, chlamydephorid slugs, and predaceous dung beetles of the genera Sceliages and Deltochilum. A large subfamily of assassin bugs, the Ectrichodiinae with over 600 species, has specialized in preying upon <b>millipedes.</b> Parasites of <b>millipedes</b> include nematodes, phaeomyiid flies, and acanthocephalans.|$|R
5|$|Millipedes {{have also}} {{inspired}} and played roles in scientific research. In 1963, a walking vehicle with 36 legs was designed, {{said to have}} been inspired by a study of <b>millipede</b> locomotion.|$|E
5|$|A novel {{interaction}} between millipedes and mosses {{was described in}} 2011, in which individuals of the newly discovered Psammodesmus bryophorus {{was found to have}} up to ten species living on its dorsal surface, in what may provide camouflage for the <b>millipede</b> and increased dispersal for the mosses.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{in several}} orders have keel-like {{extensions}} of the body-wall known as paranota, which can vary widely in shape, size, and texture; modifications include lobes, papillae, ridges, crests, spines and notches. Paranota may allow millipedes to wedge more securely into crevices, protect the legs, or make the <b>millipede</b> more difficult for predators to swallow.|$|E
2500|$|Pill <b>millipedes</b> can be {{distinguished}} from woodlice {{on the basis of}} having two pairs of legs per body segment instead of one pair like all isopods. Pill <b>millipedes</b> have twelve to thirteen body segments and about eighteen pairs of legs, whereas woodlice have eleven segments and only seven pairs of legs. [...] In addition, pill <b>millipedes</b> are smoother, and resemble normal <b>millipedes</b> in overall colouring and the shape of the segments.|$|R
50|$|Sphaerotheriidae is {{a family}} of giant pill <b>millipedes</b> of the class Diplopoda. <b>Millipedes</b> of this family are {{distributed}} in southern Africa.|$|R
50|$|A {{range of}} {{primates}} rub <b>millipedes</b> onto their fur and skin; <b>millipedes</b> contain benzoquinones, compounds {{known to be}} potently repellent to insects.|$|R
5|$|After Chamberlin's death, his {{collection}} of some 250,000 spider specimens was donated to the American Museum of Natural History in New York, bolstering the museum's status as the world's largest arachnid repository. Similarly, {{his collection}} of millipedes was deposited in the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., helping to make that museum the world's largest single collection of <b>millipede</b> type specimens—the individual specimens used to describe species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Millipede</b> eyes {{consist of}} several simple flat-lensed ocelli {{arranged}} in a group or patch {{on each side of}} the head. These patches are also called ocular fields or ocellaria. Many species of millipedes, including the entire order Polydesmida and cave-dwelling millipedes such as Causeyella and Trichopetalum, had ancestors that could see but have subsequently lost their eyes and are blind.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{relationships}} of <b>millipede</b> orders are still the subject of debate, the class Diplopoda {{as a whole is}} considered a monophyletic group of arthropods: all millipedes are more closely related to each other than to any other arthropods. Diplopoda is a class within of the arthropod subphylum Myriapoda, the myriapods, which includes centipedes (class Chilopoda) as well as the lesser-known pauropods (class Pauropoda) and symphylans (class Symphyla). Within myriapods, the closest relatives or sister group of millipedes has long been considered the pauropods, which also have a collum and diplosegments.|$|E
50|$|Spirostreptida is {{an order}} of long, {{cylindrical}} <b>millipedes.</b> There are approximately 1000 described species, making Spirostrepida the second largest order of <b>millipedes</b> after Polydesmida.|$|R
50|$|Motyxia is a genus of cyanide-producing <b>millipedes</b> (collectively {{known as}} Sierra {{luminous}} <b>millipedes</b> or motyxias) that are endemic {{to the southern}} Sierra Nevada, Tehachapi, and Santa Monica mountain ranges of California. Motyxias are blind and produce the poison cyanide, like {{all members of the}} Polydesmida. All species have the ability to glow brightly: some of the few known instances of bioluminescence in <b>millipedes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Polydesmida (from the Greek poly [...] "many" [...] and desmos [...] "bond") is {{the largest}} order of <b>millipedes,</b> {{containing}} approximately 3,500 species, including all the <b>millipedes</b> reported to produce hydrogen cyanide (HCN).|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 16 living orders, there are 9 extinct orders and one superfamily known only from fossils. The relationship of these to living groups and to each other is controversial. The extinct Arthropleuridea was long considered a distinct myriapod class, although work in the early 21st century established {{the group as a}} subclass of millipedes. Several living orders also appear in the fossil record. Below are two proposed arrangements of fossil <b>millipede</b> groups. Extinct groups are indicated with a dagger (†). The extinct order Zosterogrammida, a chilognath of uncertain position, is not shown.|$|E
5|$|<b>Millipede</b> bodies may be {{flattened}} or cylindrical, and {{are composed}} of numerous metemeric segments, each with an exoskeleton consisting of five chitinous plates: a single plate above (the tergite), one at each side (pleurites), and a plate on the underside (sternite) where the legs attach. In many millipedes, these plates are fused to varying degrees, sometimes forming a single cylindrical ring. The plates are typically hard, being impregnated with calcium salts. Because they lack a waxy cuticle, millipedes are susceptible to water loss and must {{spend most of their}} time in moist or humid environments.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{generally}} have little impact to human economic or social well-being, especially {{in comparison with}} insects, although locally {{they can be a}} nuisance or agricultural pest. Millipedes do not bite, and their defensive secretions are mostly harmless to humans — usually causing only minor discolouration on the skin — but the secretions of some tropical species may cause pain, itching, local erythema, edema, blisters, eczema, and occasionally cracked skin. Eye exposures to these secretions causes general irritation and potentially more severe effects such as conjunctivitis and keratitis. This is called <b>millipede</b> burn. First aid consists of flushing the area thoroughly with water; further treatment is aimed at relieving the local effects.|$|E
5000|$|Pill <b>millipedes</b> are any {{members of}} two living (and one extinct) orders of <b>millipedes,</b> often grouped {{together}} into a single superorder, Oniscomorpha. The name Oniscomorpha refers to the millipedes' resemblance to certain woodlice (Oniscidea), also called pillbugs or [...] "roly-polies". However, <b>millipedes</b> and woodlice are not closely related (belonging to the subphyla Myriapoda and Crustacea, respectively); rather, {{this is a case}} of convergent evolution.|$|R
5|$|Most <b>millipedes</b> are slow-moving detritivores, eating {{decaying}} {{leaves and}} other dead plant matter. Some eat fungi or suck plant fluids, {{and a small}} minority are predatory. <b>Millipedes</b> are generally harmless to humans, although some can become household or garden pests, especially in greenhouses where they can cause severe damage to emergent seedlings. Most <b>millipedes</b> defend themselves {{with a variety of}} chemicals secreted from pores along the body, although the tiny bristle <b>millipedes</b> are covered with tufts of detachable bristles. Reproduction in most species is carried out by modified male legs called gonopods, which transfer packets of sperm to females.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lamk) is an {{important}} staple food {{for the people of}} north-eastern Uganda. Crop yields per unit area are low partly because of biological constraints, including pests like <b>millipedes.</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} generate information on pest incidence and control strategies of <b>millipedes</b> by interviewing farmers in different districts. The respondents associated the dying of planting material with drought. However, <b>millipedes</b> also damaged planting material planted early in the rainy season. The sweet potato butterfly (Acraea acerata, Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) was present, but considered by farmers to be insignificant. Measures to control sweet potato pests, like sanitation, were hardly implemented and insecticides were not used at all. Most respondents performed piecemeal harvesting. Whenever farmers delayed the harvest, they risked severe damage of their sweet potato crops by weevils (Cylas spp., Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and <b>millipedes</b> (Diplopoda). <b>Millipedes</b> pierce and tunnel the storage roots, especially when harvesting is delayed. The farmers did not mention specific natural control agents for <b>millipedes.</b> Knowledge about pests was generally limited, so control strategies were poorly developed, understood and applied...|$|R
5|$|Some millipedes are {{considered}} household pests, including Xenobolus carnifex which can infest thatched roofs in India, and Ommatoiulus moreleti, which periodically invades homes in Australia. Other species exhibit periodical swarming behaviour, which {{can result in}} home invasions, crop damage, and train delays when the tracks become slippery with the crushed remains of hundreds of millipedes. Some millipedes can cause significant damage to crops: the spotted snake <b>millipede</b> (Blaniulus guttulatus) is a noted pest of sugar beets and other root crops, {{and as a result}} {{is one of the few}} millipedes with a common name.|$|E
5|$|The genital {{openings}} (gonopores) of {{both sexes}} are located {{on the underside of}} the third body segment (near the second pair of legs) and may be accompanied in the male by one or two penes which deposit the sperm packets onto the gonopods. In the female, the genital pores open into paired small sacs called cyphopods or vulvae, which are covered by small hood-like lids, and are used to store the sperm after copulation. The cyphopod morphology can also be used to identify species. <b>Millipede</b> sperm lack flagella, a unique trait among myriapods.|$|E
5|$|The {{head of a}} <b>millipede</b> is {{typically}} rounded above and flattened below and bears a pair of large mandibles {{in front of a}} plate-like structure called a gnathochilarium ("jaw lip"). The head contains a single pair of antennae with seven or eight segments and a group of sensory cones at the tip. Many orders also possess a pair of sensory organs known as the Tömösváry organs, shaped as small oval rings posterior and lateral {{to the base of the}} antennae. Their function is unknown, but they also occur in some centipedes, and are possibly used to measure humidity or light levels in the surrounding environment.|$|E
5|$|Among myriapods, <b>millipedes</b> have {{traditionally}} been considered most {{closely related to the}} tiny pauropods, although some molecular studies challenge this relationship. <b>Millipedes</b> can be distinguished from the somewhat similar but only distantly related centipedes (class Chilopoda), which move rapidly, are carnivorous, and have only a single pair of legs on each body segment. The scientific study of <b>millipedes</b> is known as diplopodology, and a scientist who studies them is called a diplopodologist.|$|R
50|$|Spirostreptida are {{generally}} large, long and cylindrical, with 30 to 90 body rings. Eyes {{are present in}} most. This order contains the longest <b>millipedes</b> known: the giant African <b>millipedes</b> of the genus Archispirostreptus that may exceed 30 cm.|$|R
50|$|Bristly <b>millipedes</b> {{lack the}} {{chemical}} defenses and hard exoskeleton of other <b>millipedes,</b> and instead employ a unique defense mechanism: the distinctive barbed bristles can easily detach and become {{entangled in the}} limbs and mouth-parts of predatory insects, effectively immobilizing them.|$|R
5|$|The {{legs are}} {{composed}} of seven segments, and attach {{on the underside of}} the body. The legs of an individual are generally rather similar to each other, although often longer in males than females, and males of some species may have a reduced or enlarged first pair of legs. The most conspicuous leg modifications are involved in reproduction, discussed below. Despite the common name, no <b>millipede</b> has been discovered with 1,000 legs: common species have between 34 and 400 legs, and the record is held by Illacme plenipes, with individuals possessing up to 750 legs – more than any other creature on Earth.|$|E
5|$|An insect {{survey in}} September 2009 {{recorded}} 187 beetle species, including two new to Norfolk, the rove beetle Phytosus nigriventris and the fungus beetle Leiodes ciliaris, and two very rarely {{seen in the}} county, the sap beetle Nitidula carnaria and the clown beetle Gnathoncus nanus. There were also 24 types of spider, and the five ant species included the nationally rare Myrmica specioides. The rare <b>millipede</b> Thalassisobates littoralis, a specialist of coastal shingle habitats, was found here in 1972, and a red-veined darter appeared in 2012. Tens of thousands of migrant turnip sawflies were recorded {{for a few days}} in late summer 2006, along with red-eyed damselflies. The silver Y moth also appears in large numbers in some years.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes show a {{diversity}} of mating styles and structures. In the basal order Polyxenida (bristle millipedes), mating is indirect: males deposit spermatophores onto webs they secrete with special glands, and the spermatophores are subsequently picked up by females. In all other <b>millipede</b> groups, males possess one or two pairs of modified legs called gonopods which are used to transfer sperm to the female during copulation. The location of the gonopods differs between groups: in males of the Pentazonia they are located {{at the rear of}} the body and known as telopods and may also function in grasping females, while in the Helminthomorpha – the vast majority of species – they are located on the seventh body segment. A few species are parthenogenetic, having few, if any, males.|$|E
5000|$|Arthropods are {{invertebrates}} with segmented {{bodies and}} jointed limbs. [...] The exoskeleton or cuticles consists of chitin, a polymer of glucosamine. The cuticle of many crustaceans, beetle mites, and <b>millipedes</b> (except for bristly <b>millipedes)</b> is also biomineralized with calcium carbonate.|$|R
50|$|Small mites {{are often}} {{observed}} crawling on their exoskeleton and among their legs. The <b>millipedes</b> have {{a symbiotic relationship}} with these mites, in which the mites help clean the <b>millipedes</b> exoskeleton in exchange for food {{and the protection of}} their host.|$|R
5000|$|Masses of O. moreleti on railway lines {{during their}} {{activity}} periods are reported as causing slippage of locomotives in South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia., causing train cancellations {{due to the}} disturbance of signalling equipment. Crushed <b>millipedes</b> may have caused a 2013 minor train crash in Clarkson, Western Australia. [...] <b>Millipedes</b> on the tracks appear to have affected the train's deceleration.On Adelaide suburban trains are fitted with brushes before the front wheels to clear the line of <b>millipedes.</b>|$|R
