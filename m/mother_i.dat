500|$|George and May {{had five}} {{sons and a}} daughter. Randolph Churchill claimed that George was a strict father, {{to the extent that}} his {{children}} were terrified of him, and that George had remarked to Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby: [...] "My father was frightened of his <b>mother,</b> <b>I</b> was frightened of my father, and I am damned well going {{to see to it that}} my children are frightened of me." [...] In reality, there is no direct source for the quotation and it is likely that George's parenting style was little different from that adopted by most people at the time.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before her}} death, {{when asked if}} she had been too cruel in her writing, Phillips replied, [...] "We all have our standards.

[...] She was {{similarly}} unrepentant about her subsequent expatriation, saying [...] "I wasn't a pariah because I was a drug-addicted, alcoholic, rotten person and not a good <b>mother.</b> <b>I</b> was a pariah because I hit them with a harsh, fluorescent light and rendered them as contemptible as they truly are." ...|$|E

[...] The following year, Congress passed the Former Presidents Act, offering a $25,000 yearly pension to each {{former president}}, and it is likely that Truman's financial status played a role in the law's enactment. The one other living former president at the time, Herbert Hoover, also took the pension, even though he did not need the money; reportedly, he did so to avoid embarrassing Truman.|$|E

500|$|Sergeant Boston Corbett {{crept up}} behind the barn and shot Booth in [...] "the {{back of the head}} about an inch below the spot where his [...] shot had entered the head of Mr. Lincoln", {{severing}} his spinal cord. Booth was carried out onto the steps of the barn. A soldier poured water into his mouth, which he spat out, unable to swallow. Booth told the soldier, [...] "Tell my <b>mother</b> <b>I</b> die for my country." [...] Unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face and whispered his last words as he gazed at them: [...] "Useless... useless." [...] He died on the porch of the Garrett farm two hours later. Corbett was initially arrested for disobeying orders, but was later released and was largely considered a hero by the media and the public.|$|E
500|$|From the mid-1850s, Emily's mother became {{effectively}} bedridden {{with various}} chronic illnesses {{until her death}} in 1882. Writing to a friend in summer 1858, Emily {{said that she would}} visit if she could leave [...] "home, or <b>mother.</b> <b>I</b> do not go out at all, lest father will come and miss me, or miss some little act, which I might forget, should I run away– Mother is much as usual. I Know not what to hope of her". As her mother continued to decline, Dickinson's domestic responsibilities weighed more heavily upon her and she confined herself within the Homestead. Forty years later, Lavinia stated that because their mother was chronically ill, one of the daughters had to remain always with her. Emily took this role as her own, and [...] "finding the life with her books and nature so congenial, continued to live it".|$|E

500|$|Amidst all of {{this family}} turmoil, Imlay still found time to ponder larger social issues. The utopian socialist Robert Owen came to visit Godwin {{in the summer of}} 1816 and he and Imlay {{discussed}} the plight of the working poor in Britain. She agreed with many of Owen's proposals, but not all of them. She decided, in the end, that his utopian scheme was too [...] "romantic", because it depended heavily on the goodwill of the rich to sacrifice their wealth. That same summer, George Blood—the brother of Fanny Imlay's namesake—came to meet {{her for the first time}} and told her stories of her mother. After this meeting she wrote to Mary Godwin and Shelley: [...] "I have determined never to live to be a disgrace to such a <b>mother...</b> <b>I</b> have found that if I will endeavour to overcome my faults I shall find being's [...] to love and esteem me" [...]|$|E
500|$|Gil's {{interest}} in music was precocious: [...] "When I {{was only two}} or two and a half," [...] he recalled, [...] "I told my <b>mother</b> <b>I</b> {{was going to become}} a musician or a president of my country." [...] He grew up listening to the forró music of his native northeast, and took an {{interest in}} the street performers of Salvador. Early on, he began to play the drums and the trumpet, through listening to Bob Nelson on the radio. Gil's mother was the [...] "chief supporter" [...] in his musical ambitions; she bought him an accordion and, when he was ten years old, sent him to music school in Salvador which he attended for four years. As an accordionist, Gil first played classical music, but grew more interested in the folk and popular music of Brazil. He was particularly influenced by singer and accordion player Luiz Gonzaga; he began to sing and play the accordion in an emulation of Gonzaga's recordings. Gil has noted that he grew to identify with Gonzaga [...] "because he sang about the world around , the world that [...] encountered." ...|$|E
500|$|Of Grainger the pianist, The New York Times critic Harold Schonberg {{wrote that}} his unique style was [...] {{expressed}} with [...] "amazing skill, personality and vigor". [...] The early enthusiasm which had greeted his concert appearances became muted in later years, and reviews of his performances {{during the final}} ten {{years of his life}} were often harsh. [...] However, Britten regarded Grainger's late recording of the Grieg concerto, from a live performance at Aarhus in 1957, as [...] "one of the noblest ever committed to record" [...] – despite the suppression of the disc for many years, because of the proliferation of wrong notes and other faults. [...] Brian Allison from the Grainger Museum, referring to Grainger's early displays of artistic skills, has speculated that had John Grainger's influence not been removed, [...] "Percy Aldridge Grainger may today be remembered as one of Australia's leading painters and designers, who just happened to have a latent talent as a pianist and composer". The ethnomusicologist John Blacking, while acknowledging Grainger's contribution to social and cultural aspects of music, nevertheless writes that if the continental foundation of Grainger's musical education had not been [...] "undermined by dilettantism and the disastrous influence of his <b>mother,</b> <b>I</b> am sure that his ultimate contribution to the world of music would have been much greater".|$|E

500|$|In May2007, Usher {{split with}} Patton as his manager. This {{prompted}} [...] "gossip" [...] that Usher had [...] "fired" [...] {{her because of}} his growing relationship with Foster. He denied the claims, saying, [...] "I love my <b>mother</b> ... <b>I</b> decided not to fire, not get rid of, but to give [...] the ultimate complimentto retire {{her to be a}} full-time grandmother." [...] He continued by stating that the split was a mutual decision. It was speculated that Patton's dismissal was due to his engagement with Foster; Usher dismissed these claims on Total Request Live (TRL) in May2008. In what MTV News' Shawn Adler called an [...] "angry tirade", Usher stated, [...] "My wife {{had nothing to do with}} me firing my mother — nothing like that, that's trash. I hear y'all talking crazy out there. She's a beautiful black woman. Stop. Stop talking. And I love her. Stop it." [...] The outbreak was compared to Mariah Carey's unannounced 2001 appearance on TRL, when she handed out popsicles to the show's audience and performed a [...] "striptease", while some fans noted Usher's speech as evidence that Foster was being controlling of Usher. Usher hired Benny Medina as his new manager; Medina said of Usher, [...] "The thing that excited me most is the intense commitment to his art, his incredible professionalism and the fact that I feel as though he's just hitting a stride." ...|$|E
500|$|Conger {{tracked down}} Jett and interrogated him, {{learning}} of Booth's location at the Garrett farm. Before dawn on April 26, the soldiers {{caught up with}} the fugitives, who were hiding in Garrett's tobacco barn. David Herold surrendered, but Booth refused Conger's demand to surrender, saying, [...] "I prefer to come out and fight." [...] The soldiers then set the barn on fire. As Booth moved about inside the blazing barn, Sergeant Boston Corbett shot him. According to Corbett's later account, he fired at Booth because the fugitive [...] "raised his pistol to shoot" [...] at them. Conger's report to Stanton stated that Corbett shot Booth [...] "without order, pretext or excuse," [...] and recommended that Corbett be punished for disobeying orders to take Booth alive. Booth, fatally wounded in the neck, was dragged from the barn to the porch of Garrett's farmhouse, where he died three hours later, aged 26. The bullet had pierced three vertebrae and partially severed his spinal cord, paralyzing him. In his dying moments, he reportedly whispered, [...] "Tell my <b>mother</b> <b>I</b> died for my country." [...] Asking that his hands be raised to his face so that he could see them, Booth uttered his last words, [...] "Useless, useless," [...] and died as dawn was breaking. In Booth's pockets were found a compass, a candle, pictures of five women (actresses Alice Grey, Helen Western, Effie Germon, Fannie Brown, and Booth's fiancée Lucy Hale), and his diary, where he had written of Lincoln's death, [...] "Our country owed all her troubles to him, and God simply made me the instrument of his punishment." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{enduring}} friendship {{featured in}} EastEnders {{was the one}} shared between the characters Dot Cotton and Ethel Skinner (played by Gretchen Franklin), first shown on-screen in 1985 and ending with Ethel's death in 2000, though the characters shared a backstory set prior to 1985 and were scripted as neighbours who grew old together in East London, along with Lou Beale (Anna Wing). BBC News has described Dot and Ethel as an [...] "incomparable double-act [...] Occasionally spiky and often hilarious". Dot and Ethel shared few similarities in personality. During an episode that aired in 2008, just under 8 years after Ethel died in the serial, Dot discussed the differences between them: [...] "Ethel was a free spirit, not like me. All bottled up. I remember sitting on the step of the Vic, waiting for me <b>mother.</b> <b>I</b> {{caught a glimpse of}} her through the door. Sitting on top of the piano, her legs spread, showing next week's washing and bawling out [...] "Roll Out the Barrel". Just like a navvy. She didn't seem to have a care in the world. I had enough for both of us. I loved Ethel." [...] Critic for The Guardian, Nancy Banks-Smith, discussed the characters' relationship in 2008, comparing them to the girls written about by Dylan Thomas: [...] "There was always one pretty and pert , and always one in glasses [...]" [...] Banks-Smith adds that theirs was [...] "a symbiotic relationship in which the pretty one looks even prettier by contrast and the plain one is popular by proxy. Which is not to say it is not a real and enduring friendship." ...|$|E
