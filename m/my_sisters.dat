Tzipora held Mother's hand.

25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, <b>my</b> <b>sisters</b> and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E

There was too much discipline and routine involved. I felt like it would be a challenge, to step forth and do it, to see what it was all about. It gave a sense of confidence. At the time girls just didn't join the WAVES or go into the military. But my Dad, he said, you'll be OK".|$|E

500|$|Munnerlyn {{is active}} with March of Dimes charities, a cause {{close to his}} heart as he was a {{premature}} baby himself. When asked why his name is Captain, Munnerlyn said, [...] "My momma promised my grandmomma that she could name the last child. I was the boy of the family, and she named me Captain. Her great grandfather was named Captain, so I got named after my great-great grandfather. <b>My</b> <b>sisters</b> and brothers have normal names. I got the odd name. In the beginning {{it was kind of}} rough. Kids used to tease me a little, but it fits my personality, because I feel like I'm a leader." [...] Munnerlyn majored in criminal justice while at South Carolina, where he was teammates and roommates with former Viking linebacker Jasper Brinkley. He was named the 2015 Korey Stringer Good Guy Award winner by media covering the Vikings. Munnerlyn is married to Lakisha and has two sons, Captain and Champ, and daughter, Eden. [...] Munnerlyn now serves on the board of his condominium association in alongside Charlotte based truck owner, Jeremy Thomas.|$|E
500|$|After {{seven years}} as {{director}} of the Royal Ballet, MacMillan resigned in 1977, wishing to concentrate on choreography. He was succeeded as artistic director by Norman Morrice, whose background was the more avant garde Ballet Rambert. MacMillan took up the post of principal choreographer. His fourth full-length ballet, Mayerling (1978), was a dark work, portraying the suicides of the Austrian Crown Prince Rudolf and his young mistress. Parry comments that some scenarios for his new one-act ballets featured similarly dark themes: [...] "a disturbed family in My Brother, <b>My</b> <b>Sisters,</b> a lunatic asylum in Playground; Valley of Shadows ... included scenes in a Nazi concentration camp." [...] Different Drummer (1984) was a balletic version of Georg Büchner's Woyzeck, familiar to Covent Garden audiences from Berg's 1925 opera Wozzeck: all three depict the brutal fate of the downtrodden. Even the lighter of MacMillan's ballets could have their serious side: La fin du jour (1979), to Ravel's Piano Concerto in G, depicts a way of life of the 1930s soon to be shattered by the Second World War, and is described by Crisp as [...] "a requiem for the douceur de vivre of an era".|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous {{incident}} that illustrates the Saint's humility towards nature is recounted in the [...] "Fioretti" [...] ("Little Flowers"), a collection of legends and folklore that sprang up after the Saint's death. It is said that, one day, while Francis was travelling with some companions, they happened upon {{a place in the}} road where birds filled the trees on either side. Francis told his companions to [...] "wait for me while I go to preach to <b>my</b> <b>sisters</b> the birds." [...] The birds surrounded him, intrigued by the power of his voice, and not one of them flew away. He is often portrayed with a bird, typically in his hand.|$|E
2500|$|I had polio, and I {{was totally}} paralyzed, and the {{inflammation}} {{was so great}} that I had a sensory paralysis too. I could move my eyes and my hearing was undisturbed. I got very lonesome lying in bed, unable to move anything except my eyeballs. I was quarantined on the farm with seven sisters, one brother, two parents, and a practical nurse. And how could I entertain myself? I started watching people and my environment. I soon learned that <b>my</b> <b>sisters</b> could say [...] "no" [...] when they meant [...] "yes."

2500|$|She {{was educated}} {{alongside}} her sister, Princess Elizabeth, by their Scottish governess Marion Crawford. Margaret's education was mainly supervised by her mother, {{who in the}} words of Randolph Churchill [...] "never aimed at bringing her daughters up to be more than nicely behaved young ladies". When Queen Mary insisted upon the importance of education, the Duchess of York commented, [...] "I don't know what she meant. After all I and <b>my</b> <b>sisters</b> only had governesses and we all married well—one of us very well". Margaret was resentful about her limited education, especially in later years, and aimed criticism at her mother. However, Margaret's mother told a friend that she [...] "regretted" [...] that her daughters did not go to school like other children, and the employment of a governess rather than sending the girls to school may have been done only at the insistence of King George V.|$|E

Barrett recognized the similarities between herself and the young woman, and concluded that only luck separated her from the young woman in her home; one of them {{had fallen in love with}} a [...] "good" [...] man and one with a [...] "bad" [...] one. Furthermore, from her own experiences as a slaveholder and with Jim Crow laws, Barrett also realized how spirits could be broken by degradation. Profoundly moved by her new-found bond with this [...] "fallen" [...] woman, she vowed, [...] "By the power of God that rules the Universe, I would spend my life trying to wipe out some of the inequalities that were meted out to <b>my</b> <b>sisters</b> who were so helpless to help themselves." ...|$|E

40|$|My thesis {{analyzes}} {{adopts a}} discursive approach to reconstruct and recover the life history and memory of <b>my</b> <b>sister,</b> who committed suicide {{at the age}} of 21. As opposed to looking for <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> in the pathologizing, hidden accounts of diagnostic categories, a discursive approach within communication allows me to look for her in what in visible and manifest in language. I transcribed three narratives describing <b>my</b> <b>sister’s</b> life and analyzed them in conjunction with literature and a textual analysis. The narratives are spoken transcriptions from my mother, a local chiropractor who befriended <b>my</b> <b>sister,</b> and I. The literature review focused on communication between people, identities, different perspectives, and the events that create life stories. The discourse analysis consists of a monologue of emails from <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> to <b>my</b> mother, her résumé, and an online post to a foreign exchange website. Searching for <b>My</b> <b>Sister</b> seeks to show that the identities of people are simply stories; they are stories we constantly recreate about ourselves and others.
