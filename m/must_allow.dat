5|$|In {{the sport}} of ferret-legging, {{competitors}} tie their trousers at the ankles before placing two ferrets inside and securely fastening their belts to prevent the ferrets from escaping. Each competitor then {{stands in front of}} the judges for as long as he can. Competitors cannot be drunk or drugged, nor can the ferrets be sedated. In addition, competitors are not allowed to wear underwear beneath their trousers, which <b>must</b> <b>allow</b> the ferrets free access from one leg to the other, and the ferrets must have a full set of teeth that must not have been filed or otherwise blunted. The winner is the person who lasts the longest.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the WIPO case Glynnis MacNicol of Mediaite commented that those including Glenn Beck afforded freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment <b>must</b> <b>allow</b> for an Internet environment with the same rights given to everyone. Brayton of ScienceBlogs pointed out that Beck and his lawyers never replied to Randazza's request for all parties to stipulate to the U.S. Constitution and the First Amendment in the case. Brayton observed that this was irrelevant as Beck's case was weak even when examined under the standards of the UN agency. Of Eiland-Hall's decision to turn the domain over to Beck after {{the conclusion}} of the case he commented that this was a wise strategic move. Monica Hesse of The Washington Post remarked upon {{the conclusion of}} the case that the division between what is considered libel and satire was murky, and asked whether this determination was more difficult to make on the Internet where speech can be amplified by others.|$|E
5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil {{in order to understand the}} consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he <b>must</b> <b>allow</b> human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.|$|E

25|$|In general, Canadian {{cities have}} rates of public transit use which are {{two to three}} times as high as comparably sized U.S. cities. Census data for 2006 show that 11.0% of Canadians use public transit to commute to work, {{compared}} to 4.8% of Americans. This means that transportation planners <b>must</b> <b>allow</b> for higher passenger volumes on Canadian transit systems than American ones.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, the CSU removed {{recognition}} from certain religious organizations that had policy conflicts with a state-mandated nondiscrimination policy. The new policy stated that religious clubs <b>must</b> <b>allow</b> any student eligibility to participate {{as a student}} leader regardless of beliefs. Both CRU and Intervarsity, as of Fall 2015, came to {{an agreement with the}} Chancellor that allowed them to return to campus, while allowing them to maintain their religious beliefs.|$|E

Surprisingly, very little is written about continued employment for the theatre instructor. In the present study, the terms instructor and teacher carry the same meaning.

25|$|Most Jewish {{religious}} authorities {{held that}} a husband <b>must</b> <b>allow</b> his wife to eat {{at the same table}} as him, even if he gave his wife enough money to provide for herself. By contrast, if a husband mistreated his wife, or lived in a disreputable neighbourhood, the Jewish religious authorities would permit the wife to move to another home elsewhere, and would compel the husband to finance her life there.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the power}} that would be lost, {{resistors}} are not used as ballasts for lamps of more than about two watts. Instead, a reactance is used. Losses in the ballast due to its resistance and losses in its magnetic core may be significant, {{on the order of}} 5 to 25% of the lamp input electric power. Practical lighting design calculations <b>must</b> <b>allow</b> for ballast loss in estimating the running cost of a lighting installation.|$|E

25|$|Time. A {{key factor}} in guerrilla {{strategy}} is a drawn-out, protracted conflict that wears down {{the will of the}} opposing counter-insurgent forces. Democracies are especially vulnerable to the factor of time. The counter-insurgent force <b>must</b> <b>allow</b> enough time to get the job done. Impatient demands for victory centered around short-term electoral cycles play {{into the hands of the}} guerrillas, though it is equally important to recognize when a cause is lost and the guerrillas have won.|$|E
25|$|For Hitchcock, the actors, {{like the}} props, {{were part of}} the film's setting, as he said to Truffaut:In my opinion, the chief {{requisite}} for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds. He should be willing to be utilised and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He <b>must</b> <b>allow</b> the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights.|$|E
