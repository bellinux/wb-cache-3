5|$|On Thursday, December 12, 1799, Washington {{spent several}} hours {{inspecting}} his plantation on horseback, in snow, hail, and freezing rain; that evening, he ate his supper without changing from his wet clothes. He awoke the next <b>morning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> severe sore throat and became increasingly hoarse {{as the day}} progressed, yet still rode out in the heavy snow, marking trees for cutting on the plantation. Some time around 3a.m. that Saturday, he suddenly awoke with severe difficulty breathing and almost completely unable to speak or swallow. He was {{a firm believer in}} bloodletting, which was a standard medical practice of that era, and he had used it to treat various ailments of slaves on his plantation. He ordered estate overseer Albin Rawlins to remove nearly a pint of his blood.|$|E
5|$|The {{first day}} was {{abandoned}} due to rain. Australia lost the toss and were sent in to bat on a drying pitch. The 19-year-old Lancashire spin bowler Malcolm Hilton took Bradman's wicket {{twice in the}} match, causing a media sensation. Hilton bowled Bradman with an arm ball for 11, the Australian captain's first score on tour below 80. The Australian batsmen failed to capitalise on their starts as six were dismissed between 20 and 40. Australia looked set to concede a lead {{for the first time}} on tour as the hosts reached 3/129, but Johnston (5/49) took five of the last seven wickets for 28 runs in Lancashire's only innings, which ended on the third <b>morning.</b> <b>With</b> <b>a</b> result impossible, Australia had time for batting practice. Bradman reached 43, and when Hilton came on, the Australian captain, perhaps perturbed by earlier events, attempted to hit the spinner out of the attack. After missing the first two balls, Bradman charged the third, swung and missed, fell over and was stumped. Harvey (76*) and Hamence (49*) shared an unbeaten fifth-wicket partnership of 122 after Loxton made 52.|$|E

25|$|The East Syrian Rite (also {{known as}} the Chaldean, Assyrian, or Persian Rite) has {{historically}} been used in Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia, and Malabar. The nucleus of the Daily Office is of course the recitation of the Psalter. There are only three regular hours of service (Evening, Midnight, and <b>Morning),</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rarely used Compline. When East Syrian monasteries existed (which {{is no longer the}} case) seven hours of prayer were the custom in them, and three hulali (sections) of the Psalter were recited at each service. This would accomplish the unique feat of the common recitation of the entire Psalter each day.|$|E
25|$|Airwing {{commenced}} {{its first}} scheduled service on 11 July 2012, from Notodden Airport, Tuven to Stavanger Airport, Sola. With one daily round trip, to Stavanger {{in the morning}} and to Notodden in the afternoon, the route targeted the subsea industry in Notodden and Kongsberg. The route sufficiently successful that Airwing started a second route out of Notodden, to Bergen Airport, Flesland. This route was, however, in competition with an existing airline, Bergen Air Transport. As with the Stavanger route, the Bergen route was flown out of Notodden in the <b>morning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> return in the afternoon. From 21 May 2013 Airwing extended the Stavanger service with a second leg, continuing onwards to Florø Airport and with a return in the afternoon. By 2015 the route to Bergen had been terminated.|$|E

25|$|South Africa A {{once again}} {{got a good}} start with the ball, Zondeki getting Tharanga and Ian Daniel out caught, but Lokuhettige once again defied them, as he and captain Gunawardene were batting on the third <b>morning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> slender lead of 127. Lokuhettige hit six fours and one six {{on the way to}} 51, and his 79-run {{partnership}} brought Sri Lanka out of trouble. Johan Botha eventually had him caught, but the damage had been done, and Gunawardene could also get his century as Sri Lanka A set the tourists 219 to win. South Africa A were immediately set on the back foot, losing openers Puttick and Rudolph early to have the score at five runs for two wickets, and Jayaweera then took three wickets as South Africa A struggled to 57 for 5. Jayaweera, however, was not allowed to bowl, possibly due to the light conditions, and Weerakoon went wicketless as Amla and Botha survived 41 overs and {{two and a half hours}} to draw the game. Nevertheless, the hosts won the series 10.|$|E
25|$|On July 26, Hooker was {{promoted}} to major general, to rank from May 5. During the Second Battle of Bull Run, the III Corps was sent to reinforce John Pope's Army of Virginia. Following Second Bull Run, Hooker replaced Irvin McDowell as commander of the Army of Virginia's III Corps, soon redesignated the I Corps of the Army of the Potomac. During the Maryland Campaign, Hooker led the I Corps at South Mountain and at Antietam, his corps launched the first assault of the bloodiest day in American history, driving south into the corps of Lt. Gen. Stonewall Jackson, where they fought each other to a standstill. Hooker, aggressive and inspiring to his men, left the battle early in the <b>morning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> foot wound. He asserted that the battle {{would have been a}} decisive Union victory if he had managed to stay on the field, but General McClellan's caution once again failed the Northern troops and Lee's much smaller army eluded destruction. With his patience at an end, President Lincoln replaced McClellan with Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside. Although Hooker had criticized McClellan persistently, the latter was apparently unaware of it and in early October, shortly before his termination, had recommended that Hooker receive a promotion to brigadier general in the regular army. The War Department promptly acted on this recommendation, and Hooker received his brigadier's commission to rank from September 20. This promotion ensured that he would remain a general after the war was over and not revert to the rank of captain or lieutenant colonel.|$|E

Once again bored and single in New York, he thought of moving to Miami to marry a lesbian friend to [...] "have a front and each {{would not be in}} the way of the other". However, he decided to remain in New York, where he secretly pursued gay relationships. In 1962 Milk became involved with Craig Rodwell, who was 10 years younger. Though Milk courted Rodwell ardently, waking him every <b>morning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> call and sending him notes, Milk was uncomfortable with Rodwell's involvement with the New York Mattachine Society, a gay-rights organization. When Rodwell was arrested for walking in Riis Park, and charged with inciting a riot and with indecent exposure (the law required men's swimsuits to extend from above the navel to below the thigh), he spent three days in jail. The relationship soon ended as Milk became alarmed at Rodwell's tendency to agitate the police.|$|E

500|$|Nico Rosberg {{was again}} fastest {{in the final}} {{practice}} session on Saturday <b>morning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> time of 1:21.083, edging out teammate Hamilton by 0.014 seconds.

It was not until thirty minutes into the session that the grip improved and many teams then opted to run the faster soft compound tyres. Rosberg set the fastest times early on and while Hamilton was able to close the gap gradually, he ended the session slightly slower than Rosberg. Behind the two Mercedes cars, Daniel Ricciardo was 0.118 seconds behind, followed by Vettel, another tenth of a second adrift. Reporting vibrations from his engine, Jenson Button again spent much time in the garage, ending the practice with the slowest time, more than eight seconds behind Rosberg.
