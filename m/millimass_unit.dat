40|$|AbstractElectrospray {{ionization}} (ESI) {{was performed}} on a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer for the endgroup and monomer mass determination of three poly(oxyalkylene) s in the mass range of 400 – 8000 Da. A combined use of the multiple charge states observed with ESI, leads to a threefold increase in accuracy of the endgroup and monomer determination. The improvement is attributed to the increased number of datapoints used for the regression procedure, yielding more accurate results. Endgroup masses are determined with a mass error better than 5 and 75 millimass units for the molecular weight range of 400 – 4200 and 6200 – 8000 Da, respectively. A mass error of better than 1 <b>millimass</b> <b>unit</b> was observed for all monomer mass determinations. With ESI, endgroup and monomer masses have been determined for poly(ethylene glycol) oligomers with a mass higher than 8000 Da. This is almost two times higher than observed with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization on the same instrument...|$|E
40|$|The {{beta decay}} of the {{radioactive}} {{members of the}} mass-eight and -twelve triads has been studied with a spiral-orbit spectrometer having a 1. 3 % resolution. The end point, half-life and log-ft values respectively are: for N{sup 12 }, 16. 37 {+-} 0. 06 MeV, 11. 43 {+-} 0. 05 milliseconds, and 4. 17; for B{sup 12 }, 13. 40 {+-} 0. 05 MeV, 20. 6 {+-} 0. 2 msec and 4. 11; for B{sup 8 }, 14 MeV (broad), 0. 75 {+-} 0. 02 sec, and 5. 72; and for Li{sup 8 }, 13 Mev (broad), 0. 87 {+-} 0. 01 sec, and 5. 67. The mass excesses in <b>millimass</b> <b>units</b> are: for N{sup 12 }, 22. 48 {+-} 0. 06; for B{sup 12 }, 18. 19 {+-} 0. 06; for B{sup 8 }, 27. 08 {+-} 0. 13; and for Li{sup 8 }, 24. 97 {+-} 0. 09. The shapes of the Kurie function for the mirror pairs indicate positron and electron transitions to the same levels of the daughter nuclide, with greater percentages in the positron branches relative to the ground-state transitions because of the higher energy available. The Li{sup 8 } and B{sup 8 } shapes {{are consistent with the}} shape of the alpha spectrum following the decay of the Be{sup 8 } daughter. Less than 1 % of the Li{sup 8 } transition and less than 5 % of the B{sup 8 } transition go to the Be{sup 8 } ground state. Besides the main transition to the broad 2. 9 -Mev level, a broad level near 11 Mev is probably involved. The ft values and the assumption of J = 0, 2, and 4 levels in Be{sup 8 } favor J = 3 for Li{sup 8 } and B{sup 8 }. The N{sup 12 } and B{sup 12 } spectra indicate transitions of a few percent to the 4. 43 - and 7. 65 -Mev levels in C{sup 12 }, with higher levels not excluded. For these nuclides J = 1 is favored. The agreement of the measured end points and resulting Q values with published values shows that the spiral-orbit spectrometer can be accurately calibrated with only the theory as a guide. Another evaluation of the spectrometer is that the measured shape of the B{sup 12 }. Kurie function is the same within statistics as that obtained elsewhere with a ring-focus magnetic-lens spectrometer...|$|R
