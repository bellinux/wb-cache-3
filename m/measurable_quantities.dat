This result enables the experimental determination of Avogadro's number and therefore the size of molecules. Einstein analyzed a dynamic equilibrium being established between opposing forces. The beauty of his argument is that the final result does not depend upon which forces are involved in setting up the dynamic equilibrium.|$|E

A state of the system is defined as a positive functional on A (a C-linear map φ : A → C with φ(u*u) ≥ 0 for all u ∈ A) such that φ(1) = 1. The expected value of the observable x, if the system is in state φ, is then φ(x).|$|E
25|$|In summary, gauge {{symmetry}} attains {{its full}} {{importance in the}} context of quantum mechanics. In the application of quantum mechanics to electromagnetism, i.e., quantum electrodynamics, gauge symmetry applies to both electromagnetic waves and electron waves. These two gauge symmetries are in fact intimately related. If a gauge transformation θ is applied to the electron waves, for example, then one must also apply a corresponding transformation to the potentials that describe the electromagnetic waves. Gauge symmetry is required in order to make quantum electrodynamics a renormalizable theory, i.e., one in which the calculated predictions of all physically <b>measurable</b> <b>quantities</b> are finite.|$|E
25|$|Dirac's Principles of Quantum Mechanics, {{published}} in 1930, is a landmark {{in the history}} of science. It quickly became one of the standard textbooks on the subject and is still used today. In that book, Dirac incorporated the previous work of Werner Heisenberg on matrix mechanics and of Erwin Schrödinger on wave mechanics into a single mathematical formalism that associates <b>measurable</b> <b>quantities</b> to operators acting on the Hilbert space of vectors that describe the state of a physical system. The book also introduced the delta function. Following his 1939 article, he also included the bra–ket notation in the third edition of his book, thereby contributing to its universal use nowadays.|$|E

The elements of music that comprise expression include dynamic indications, such as forte or piano, phrasing, differing qualities of timbre and articulation, color, intensity, energy and excitement. All of these devices can be incorporated by the performer. A performer aims to elicit responses of sympathetic feeling in the audience, and to excite, calm or otherwise sway the audience's physical and emotional responses. Musical {{expression is}} sometimes thought to be produced by a combination of other parameters, and sometimes described as a transcendent quality that is {{more than the sum of}} <b>measurable</b> <b>quantities</b> such as pitch or duration.|$|E
25|$|When <b>measurable</b> <b>quantities</b> involve cross products, the {{handedness}} of the {{coordinate systems}} used cannot be arbitrary. However, when physics laws are written as equations, {{it should be}} possible to make an arbitrary choice of the coordinate system (including handedness). To avoid problems, one should be careful to never write down an equation where the two sides do not behave equally under all transformations that need to be considered. For example, if one side of the equation is a cross product of two vectors, one must take into account that when the handedness of the coordinate system is not fixed a priori, the result is not a (true) vector but a pseudovector. Therefore, for consistency, the other side must also be a pseudovector.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacture}} of nuclei {{on the island}} of stability proves to be very difficult because the nuclei available as starting materials do not deliver the necessary sum of neutrons. For the synthesis of isotope298 of flerovium, one could use an isotope of plutonium and one of calcium that together have a sum of at least 298nucleons; for example, calcium-50 and plutonium-248. These and heavier nuclides are not available in <b>measurable</b> <b>quantities,</b> making production virtually impossible with current methods. The same problem exists for the other possible combinations of nuclides needed to generate elements on the island using target-projectile methods. It may be possible to generate the isotope298 of flerovium, if the multi-nucleon transfer reactions would work in low-energy collisions of actinide nuclei.|$|E

25|$|The {{speed of}} light is a {{dimensional}} quantity and so, as has been emphasized in this context by João Magueijo, it cannot be measured. <b>Measurable</b> <b>quantities</b> in physics are, without exception, dimensionless, although they are often constructed as ratios of dimensional quantities. For example, when {{the height of a}} mountain is measured, what is really measured is the ratio of its height to the length of a meter stick. The conventional SI system of units is based on seven basic dimensional quantities, namely distance, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity. These units are defined to be independent and so cannot be described in terms of each other. As an alternative to using a particular system of units, one can reduce all measurements to dimensionless quantities expressed in terms of ratios between the quantities being measured and various fundamental constants such as Newton's constant, the {{speed of light}} and Planck's constant; physicists can define at least 26 dimensionless constants which can be expressed in terms of these sorts of ratios and which are currently thought to be independent of one another. By manipulating the basic dimensional constants one can also construct the Planck time, Planck length and Planck energy which make a good system of units for expressing dimensional measurements, known as Planck units.|$|E

2500|$|The {{practice}} of refusing infinite values for <b>measurable</b> <b>quantities</b> {{does not come}} from a priori or ideological motivations, but rather from more methodological and pragmatic motivations [...] One of the needs of any physical and scientific theory is to give usable formulas that correspond to or at least approximate reality. As an example, if any object of infinite gravitational mass were to exist, any usage of the formula to calculate the gravitational force would lead to an infinite result, which would be of no benefit since the result would be always the same regardless of the position and the mass of the other object. The formula would be useful neither to compute the force between two objects of finite mass nor to compute their motions. If an infinite mass object were to exist, any object of finite mass would be attracted with infinite force (and hence acceleration) by the infinite mass object, which is not what we can observe in reality. Sometimes infinite result of a physical quantity may mean that the theory being used to compute the result may be approaching the point where it fails. This may help to indicate the limitations of a theory.|$|E

2500|$|A {{gauge theory}} {{is a type}} of theory in physics. The word gauge means a measurement, a thickness, an {{in-between}} distance, (as in railroad tracks) or a resulting number of units per certain parameter (a number of loops in an inch of fabric or a number of lead balls in a pound of ammunition.) Modern theories describe physical forces in terms of fields, e.g., the electromagnetic field, the gravitational field, and fields that describe forces between the elementary particles. A general feature of these field theories is that the fundamental fields cannot be directly measured; however, some associated quantities can be measured, such as charges, energies, and velocities. For example, as if for some reason you can not measure the diameter of lead balls but you can obtain an information of how many of them fit into a pound. In field theories, different configurations of the unobservable fields can result in identical observable quantities. A transformation from one such field configuration to another is called a gauge transformation; the lack of change in the <b>measurable</b> <b>quantities,</b> despite the field being transformed, is a property called gauge invariance. For example, if you could measure the color of lead balls and discover that when you change the color, you still fit the same number of balls in a pound, the property of [...] "color" [...] would show gauge invariance. Since any kind of invariance under a field transformation is considered a symmetry, gauge invariance is sometimes called gauge symmetry. Generally, any theory that has the property of gauge invariance is considered a gauge theory.|$|E

[Footnote D: This implication, in {{the first}} {{principle}} of the utilitarian scheme, of perfect impartiality between persons, is regarded by Mr. Herbert Spencer (in his Social Statics) as a disproof of the pretentions of utility to be a sufficient guide to right; since (he says) the principle of utility presupposes the anterior principle, that everybody has an equal right to happiness. It may be more correctly described as supposing that equal amounts of happiness are equally desirable, whether felt by the same or by different persons. This, however, is not a pre-supposition; not a premise needful to support the principle of utility, but the very principle itself; for what is the principle of utility, if it be not that 'happiness' and 'desirable' are synonymous terms?
