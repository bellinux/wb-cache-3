25|$|The album Comme si de rien n'était {{followed}} the No Promises album that had sold about 500,000 copies worldwide. This third album included 14 tracks, {{all of them}} composed by Carla Bruni, {{with the exception of}} two songs written in collaboration with French novelist Michel Houellebecq and the singer Julien Clerc, a cover of You Belong To <b>Me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> cover of a song of the Italian singer Francesco Guccini (Il vecchio e il bambino).|$|E
25|$|I set out alone, having neither fellow-traveller {{in whose}} {{companionship}} I might find cheer, nor caravan whose part I might join, but swayed by an overmastering impulse within <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> desire long-cherished in my bosom to visit these illustrious sanctuaries. So I braced my resolution to quit my dear ones, female and male, and forsook my home as birds forsake their nests. My parents being {{yet in the}} bonds of life, it weighed sorely upon me to part from them, and both they and I were afflicted with sorrow at this separation.|$|E

25|$|Astaire {{continued}} {{to act in}} the 1970s, appearing on television as the father of Robert Wagner's character, Alexander Mundy, in It Takes a Thief and in such films as The Towering Inferno (1974), in which he danced with Jennifer Jones and for which he received his only Academy Award nomination, in the category of Best Supporting Actor. He voiced the mailman narrator in the 1970s animated television specials Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town and The Easter Bunny Is Comin' to Town. Astaire also appeared in the first two That's Entertainment! documentaries, in the mid 1970s. In the second, aged seventy-six, he performed song-and-dance routines with Kelly, his last dance performances in a musical film. In the summer of 1975, he made three albums in London, Attitude Dancing, They Can't Take These Away from <b>Me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>A</b> Couple of Song and Dance Men, the last an album of duets with Bing Crosby. In 1976, Astaire played a supporting role, as a dog owner, in the cult movie The Amazing Dobermans, co-starring Barbara Eden and James Franciscus. Fred Astaire played Dr. Seamus Scully in the French film The Purple Taxi (1977).|$|E
500|$|Q is {{sometimes}} shown joining Bond in the field, taking {{with him a}} portable workshop and his staff. [...] These workshops are established in unusual locations, such as an Egyptian tomb in The Spy Who Loved <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> South American monastery in Moonraker. On three occasions, in Octopussy, Licence to Kill and Spectre, Q takes active roles in Bond's missions. For the 2006 Casino Royale reboot and the subsequent instalment, Quantum of Solace, the character of Q was, like Moneypenny, dropped, and although Bond still receives a supply of mission equipment, no technical briefing is shown on screen. The technical briefings resume, {{under the tutelage of}} Q, in Skyfall and Spectre.|$|E
500|$|Rae {{recorded}} most of The Sea in 2009 at Manchester's Limefield Studios. She co-produced {{the record}} mostly with Steve Brown and Steve Chrisanthou, {{both of whom}} had worked on her debut album. Rae pursued a sound more aggressive than on her debut. During the recording process, Rae listened to the 1973 Sly & the Family Stone record Fresh and Curtis Mayfield's There's No Place Like America Today (1975), {{as well as the}} music of Nina Simone and Leonard Cohen. A live band was used in the album's recording, which was also a departure from her debut. [...] "On the first album, it was <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> producer in a basement going though hundreds of snare drum sounds to find the right one", she recalled. [...] "With a live band, you can stretch out more and try new things out without feeling you're having to undo this meticulously built-up track".|$|E

500|$|Kepler-11c has {{a mass of}} 13.5 <b>ME</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> {{radius of}} 3.15 RE, making it over 13.5 times the mass of earth, but {{approximately}} 3.15 times its radius. Neptune, in comparison, has a radius approximately 3.9 times that of Earth. With a density of 2.3grams/cm3, Kepler-11c has a mass over double of that of pure water at 0 °C; it is also denser than all the Sun's gas giants, but less dense than any of its rocky planets. Its density is closest to the dwarf planet Pluto. [...] Due in part to its proximity to its star, the planet's equilibrium temperature is 833 K, about three times hotter than Earth's average temperature. It orbits Kepler-11 every 13.02502 days {{at a distance of}} [...]106 AU; it is Kepler-11's second-closest planet. Mercury, in comparison, orbits every 87.97 days at a distance of [...]387 AU. The orbit's inclination of Kepler-11c is 89°, and is thus almost edge-on as seen from Earth.|$|E
500|$|Kepler-11d has {{a mass of}} 6.1 <b>ME</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> {{radius of}} 3.43 RE, making it some six times more massive than Earth with nearly {{three and a half}} times the radius. With a density of [...]9grams/cm3, [...] Kepler-11d's density is less than that of water and {{comparable}} to that of the gas giant Saturn. This suggests that, unlike its sister planets Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c, which are closer to their host star, Kepler-11d has maintained a large atmosphere that is most likely composed to hydrogen and helium. Kepler-11d has an equilibrium temperature of 692 K, nearly 2.7 times the equilibrium temperature of Earth. Kepler-11d orbits at a mean distance of [...]159 AU from its host star and completes an orbit every 22.68719 days, making it the third planet from Kepler-11. In comparison, planet Mercury orbits the Sun every 87.97 days at a distance of [...]387 AU. Kepler-11d has an orbital inclination of 89.3°. Thus, Kepler-11d is almost exactly edge on with respect to Earth.|$|E
500|$|After the {{publication}} of The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, Chabon was mistakenly featured in a Newsweek article on up-and-coming gay writers (Pittsburghs protagonist has liaisons with people of both sexes). The New York Times later reported that [...] "in some ways, [...] was happy" [...] for the magazine's error, and quoted him as saying, [...] "I feel very lucky about all of that. It really opened up a new readership to <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> very loyal one." [...] In a 2002 interview, Chabon added, [...] "If Mysteries of Pittsburgh is about anything {{in terms of human}} sexuality and identity, it's that people can't be put into categories all that easily." [...] In [...] "On The Mysteries of Pittsburgh," [...] an essay he wrote for the New York Review of Books in 2005, Chabon remarked on the autobiographical events that helped inspire his first novel: [...] "I had slept with one man whom I loved, and learned to love another man so much that it would never have occurred to me to want to sleep with him." ...|$|E

500|$|Among other {{contemporary}} rock musicians, Stephen Stills was {{so taken}} with the song that he had its lyrics carved on a stone monument in his yard. Lennon also admired the track, saying of Harrison: [...] "His mind and his music are clear. There is his innate talent, he brought that sound together." [...] David Crosby, who introduced Harrison to Shankar's music in 1965, described Harrison's fusion of ideas as [...] "utterly brilliant", adding: [...] "He did it beautifully and tastefully... He did it at absolutely the highest level that he could, and I was extremely proud of him for that." [...] Writing in the [...] "100 Rock Icons" [...] issue of Classic Rock, in 2006, singer Paul Rodgers cited the track to support Harrison's standing as what the magazine called [...] "the Beatles' musical medicine man". Rodgers said: [...] "He introduced <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> generation of people worldwide to {{the wisdom of the}} East. His thought-provoking 'Within You Without You' – with sitars, tablas and deep lyrics – was something completely different, even in a world full of unique music." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the 1988 season, the Orioles again named Ripken their third-base coach. Speaking at the Annual Ripken Fan Club Banquet, {{general manager}} Roland Hemond said, [...] " [...] {{was a tough}} year for the Orioles, a tough year for <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> tough year for the Ripken family. There {{was a lot of}} trauma, and I {{respected}} them for the way they handled it. I will never forget it." [...] Brady Anderson, who would play for the Orioles from 1988 through 2001 and hit 50 home runs in 1996, credited Ripken for helping him make it with the Orioles: [...] "I'll never forget earlier in my career how Cal Sr. stayed with me, trying to help me become a better player when it might not have been the fashionable thing to do within the organization." [...] Ripken remained with the team until after the 1992 season, when he was removed from third-base coach duties as the Orioles wished to give younger coaches opportunities. The Orioles offered him the brand new position of coordinator of minor league field operations, but he declined, disappointed at being removed from third base. Ripken maintained that he was not retired, but he would never coach professionally again.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{had already}} started work on the album with Williams, and during one of her breaks from recording, her manager Guy Oseary spoke to Timberlake, {{suggesting}} that it [...] "would be cool" [...] if he recorded some songs with her. Timberlake commented [...] "'That would be awesome,' but I thought, 'That'll never happen', [...] But it's a testament to Pharrell. He had already laid the groundwork {{where she was going}} with it. She played 'Candy Shop' for <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> couple of other songs, and I thought, 'What a cool direction.' I thought she could essentially do the whole record with Pharrell if she wanted to, and I asked Tim, 'How do we fit in?' And it basically came down to how we did my record, co-producing, and just throwing Madonna in the mix." [...] The first track recorded by Madonna and Timberlake was [...] "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You". Timberlake felt that the song, which Madonna had been working on for years before the Hard Candy project, was comparable to [...] "Frozen" [...] (1998). He wanted to turn the line [...] "'The devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do" [...] into a catchy hook and make it sound like a concept.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked what}} {{led him to}} write a novel {{centered}} on two Afghan women, Hosseini responded:"I had been entertaining the idea of writing a story of Afghan women for some time after I'd finished writing The Kite Runner. That first novel was a male-dominated story. All the major characters, except perhaps for Amir's wife Soraya, were men. There was a whole facet of Afghan society which I hadn't touched on in The Kite Runner, an entire landscape that I felt was fertile with story ideas...In the spring of 2003, I went to Kabul, and I recall seeing these burqa-clad women sitting at street corners, with four, five, six children, begging for change. I remember watching them walking in pairs up the street, trailed by their children in ragged clothes, and wondering how life had brought them to that point...I spoke to many of those women in Kabul. Their life stories were truly heartbreaking...When I began writing A Thousand Splendid Suns, I found myself thinking about those resilient women over and over. Though no one woman that I met in Kabul inspired either Laila or Mariam, their voices, faces, and their incredible stories of survival were always with <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> good part of my inspiration for this novel came from their collective spirit." ...|$|E

I was a mail officer and I was replaced, I think, by a Captain, a couple of commanders and about 15 junior officers." [...] Hubbard stated on another occasion that he had been [...] "one of the first officers back from the upper battle areas" [...] and that he had [...] "sent on my own authority, four cargo ships loaded to the gunwales with machine gun ammunition, rifle ammunition and quinine up to MacArthur." [...] When [...] "Melbourne found out ... there were enough troops in the area so the danger was over, so I went home. I wrote myself some orders and reported back to the US." [...] According to the Church of Scientology, Hubbard was landed on the island of Java [...] "in the closing days of February 1942" [...] to search for [...] "stockpiled weapons and fast, shallow-draft vessels." [...] He was cut off by invading Japanese [...] "and was only able to escape the island after scrambling into a rubber raft and paddling out to meet an Australian destroyer." [...] Another Church of Scientology account describes Hubbard as [...] "Senior Officer Present Ashore in Brisbane, Australia" [...] and asserts that [...] "his duties included counter-intelligence and the organization of relief for beleaguered American forces on Bataan. It was in this latter capacity that he eventually saw action on the island of Java, and only eluded capture through a daring escape on a raft.
