However, only 30 of these do their own tweeting, more than 80 do not subscribe to other politicians and <b>many</b> <b>do</b> not follow any accounts.|$|E
5|$|Although Jesuit {{schools are}} not obliged to {{disassociate}} from Greek systems, <b>many</b> <b>do,</b> and Georgetown University officially recognizes and funds {{only one of the}} many Greek organizations on campus, Alpha Phi Omega, the national co-ed community service fraternity. Despite this, other Greek organizations exist on campus, however, none require members to live in fraternal housing. Additionally, Georgetown University students are affiliated, in some cases, with fraternities at other nearby universities and colleges.|$|E
5|$|However, some {{problems}} have been encountered with basing agencies in the eastern states. For example, Frontex, the new border agency, has had problems recruiting skilled experts because <b>many</b> <b>do</b> not {{want to live in}} the agency's host city, Warsaw, due to its relatively low wages and standard of living. In addition, plans to place the headquarters of Galileo in Prague met with opposition over security concerns that the city would not be safe enough for such a sensitive agency.|$|E

5|$|The ride {{features}} more than 24 regular characters from The Simpsons and features {{the voices of the}} regular cast members, as well as Pamela Hayden, Russi Taylor and Kelsey Grammer. Harry Shearer, however, decided not to participate in the ride, so none of his characters have vocal parts and <b>many</b> <b>do</b> not appear in the ride at all. In homage to the Back to the Future ride that it has replaced, The Simpsons Ride's queue video features a brief animated cameo from Doc Brown who is voiced by Christopher Lloyd.|$|E
5|$|Given this, it {{is unfortunate}} that the Cypria—the part of the Epic Cycle that covers the period of the Trojan War of Troilus' death—does not survive. Indeed, no {{complete}} narrative of his story remains from archaic times or the subsequent classical period (479–323 BC). Most of the literary sources from before the Hellenistic age (323–30 BC) that even referred to the character are lost or survive only in fragments or summary. The surviving ancient and medieval sources, whether literary or scholarly, contradict each other, and <b>many</b> <b>do</b> not tally with the form of the myth that scholars now believe to have existed in the archaic and classical periods.|$|E
