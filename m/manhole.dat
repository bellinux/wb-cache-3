5|$|Coronation Street aired {{a special}} live episode to {{celebrate}} the sixtieth anniversary of ITV. In the episode Callum and Kylie's sister-in-law Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien) argue inside the Platt's home. Callum attacks Sarah, overpowers her and threatens her life. Kylie walks in on the struggle and hits Callum {{over the head with}} a wrench. Her actions left Callum bloody and dead on her kitchen floor. The live episode concluded with David returning home to the fatal scene. He decides to help Kylie and Sarah to conceal Callum's murder. He wraps the body up and puts him down a <b>manhole</b> in their garage. The following episode features the trio plotting to dispose of Callum's body in a public space. An ongoing conversion of the garage in a bedroom extension poses a problem and they need to move quickly, but a series of events ruin their plans. Kylie and David are physically sick when they first try to remove the body from the <b>manhole.</b> They are later interrupted by a visit from the police who investigate Callum's abandoned car. Gail then hires Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) to cover up the <b>manhole</b> with concrete, unaware Callum is concealed inside.|$|E
5|$|Wastewater {{networks}} may sustain damage {{similar to}} water supply networks. It {{is very difficult}} to exclude ash from the sewerage system. Systems with combined storm water/sewer lines are most at risk. Ash will enter sewer lines where there is inflow/infiltration by stormwater through illegal connections (e.g., from roof downpipes), cross connections, around <b>manhole</b> covers or through holes and cracks in sewer pipes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, local artists also {{supplemented}} the figure with items such as radishes, pretzels, laurel wreaths and foaming beer steins. The symbol diversely appears in numerous places such as on <b>manhole</b> covers, beer steins and the top of the tower of the town hall. While the symbol as a man through being a monk was previously clear, its gender has become ambiguous since being designated the Kindl. One interpretation is that it is simply genderless, however in the 1920s a female inclination became apparent, and portrayals in person are to this day by young women.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the method of taking into account {{additional}} external horizontal loads acting on sewer <b>manholes</b> within mining areas, caused by the impact of horizontal strains on the subsurface soil layer. Methods: The determination of the dependencies of the changes in the cross-sections of flexible manholes' riser pipes (with different circumferential stiffness) on the values of horizontal soil strains, based on laboratory tests. Results: The results include formulas for determining the values of external horizontal loads acting on sewer <b>manholes</b> within mining areas, in particular flexible <b>manholes</b> made of thermoplastics. Practical implications: The results will be used for the assessment of conditions in which sewer <b>manholes</b> can be used within mining areas – and will be beneficial when considering the following: design, protection and assessment of resistance to horizontal strains. Originality/Value: The presented method is an original concept. It enables the determination of additional external horizontal loads acting on sewer <b>manholes</b> within mining areas, in particular the flexible <b>manholes</b> made of thermoplastics. It also enables the determination of dependencies of changes in the cross-sections of risers of flexible sewer <b>manholes</b> (with different circumferential stiffness) on the horizontal soil strains...|$|R

5|$|Myst was {{originally}} conceptualized by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller. The Millers had created fictional worlds and stories as young children, {{influenced by the}} works of authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert A. Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov. They formed a video game company together called Cyan, Inc.; their first game, called The <b>Manhole,</b> won the Software Publishers Association award in 1988 for best use of the digital medium. Cyan produced other games, aimed at children; the Millers eventually decided their next project would be made for adults.|$|E

Giselle quickly becomes lost. Meanwhile, Robert, a divorce lawyer, prepares to propose to his longtime girlfriend Nancy, much to the dismay of his daughter Morgan. Robert and Morgan encounter Giselle on their way home, and Robert begrudgingly allows Giselle to stay the night at their apartment at the insistence of Morgan, who trusts Giselle.|$|E
5|$|After {{emerging}} from a <b>manhole</b> in the showers of the guard living quarters, Riddick uses a guard uniform to blend in {{as he makes his}} way to the space port and his chance at escape. Realizing he requires a guard to get through the retinal scanner that locks the doors to the space port, Riddick decides to go after Abbott and take his eyes. He gains access to Abbott's apartment by telling him there is a delivery for him. A fire fight ensues and after that, as Abbott bleeds out on the floor, Riddick moves in for the kill but is stopped by Johns.|$|E

5|$|After {{learning}} that Hogeboom had murdered Fontaine and kidnapped Elsa, Phelps and Kelso pursue {{him into the}} Los Angeles River Tunnels as a heavy rain begins, fighting their way through corrupt policemen and thugs. The pair rescue Elsa, with Kelso killing Hogeboom to put {{him out of his}} mental anguish. With the water level rising, the group use an open <b>manhole</b> to escape, but Phelps is swept away in the current. Whilst the SRF scam is exposed, several members escape justice by making a deal with the Assistant D.A. to testify. They attend Phelps's funeral, each delivering eulogies to his memory, much to the disgust of Elsa. Biggs remarks to Kelso that Phelps was never his friend, to which Kelso agrees but responds that he was never Phelps' enemy.|$|E
5|$|Royce begins rapping in {{a prison}} cell, until he finds a poster and peels it off the wall to find a door compartment, a {{reference}} to 1994 drama film The Shawshank Redemption. He crawls through it and finds himself in the tunnel. Royce lights a flare to help navigate through the system. As Mars sings the bridge, the two rappers find {{their way out of}} the tunnels, through a <b>manhole</b> which leads them to a field where Mars sings. As the sun starts to set, couples, along with Bad Meets Evil, gather to see a large group of rising sky lanterns aglow. Beats by Dr. Dre headphones are advertised in the video and one couple gathers in front of a Chrysler 300. As the video reaches its conclusion, the setting gets dark and Mars sings the last lines.|$|E
5|$|Callum's {{presence}} causes countless {{problems for}} the Platt family. His court proceedings cause the feud to heighten to violence. He also manipulates David's sister Sarah and gets her daughter Bethany into trouble with drugs. Callum attacks Sarah for framing him for a crime. Kylie hits Callum with a tool and kills him. She, Sarah and David bury Callum in a <b>manhole</b> under their home. They pretend to know nothing about Callum's disappearance and try to continue with their lives. A car crash occurs and a large vehicle smashes into their home leading {{to the discovery of}} Callum's body. Kylie and David try to convince Sarah to keep up their pretence and deny all knowledge of his murder. Tony Stewart, who had recently died, is blamed for the murder and David helps manipulate the situation so that police also believe the theory. Kylie decides that she cannot bring her children up in the home she killed Callum. She convinces David to permanently move to Barbados to be with her sister, Becky. To celebrate Kylie goes to the pub to collect champagne. She hears an argument and decides to investigate. She is shocked to find Gemma being attacked by Clayton and decides to intervene. He reacts by stabbing Kylie and she begins to bleed uncontrollably. David rushes to her aid and an ambulance is called. She acknowledges she is dying and says her goodbyes to David and Gail. She then dies and paramedics fail to resuscitate her.|$|E

5|$|Each level {{contains}} various {{obstacles and}} enemies {{that the players}} must deal with. Players lose a segment from their snake if they are hit by an enemy, and they lose a life if their snake runs out of segments. Players can also lose a life if their snakes fall too far, the timer runs out, their snakes touch a sharp object, or if they are squashed by an object from above. Also, if they remain in some bodies of water for too long, a shark will attack. The game ends if players lose all their lives, but they have several continues {{in which they can}} restart the game from where they left off. Players can defeat enemies by hitting them with their tongues or by jumping on them. They can collect various items to help them along during gameplay, such as items that extend the length of the snakes' tongues, extra lives and continues, time bonuses, invisibility diamonds, and items that speed up or reverse the direction of the snakes. Located throughout the game are lids (in the shape of <b>manhole</b> covers) in which players can open to uncover Nibbly Pibbleys, items and extra lives, entrances to bonus levels, and sometimes enemies. Also located in the game are hidden warps which allow players to skip several levels and restart at a later point in the game.|$|E
25|$|While {{the high}} school was being built, workers {{discovered}} a huge cache of blasting powder in a <b>manhole</b> adjacent to the construction site.

25|$|<b>Manhole</b> covers in the {{sidewalks}} and streets nearby {{were made of}} bronze, to avoid unsightly rust stains from traditional iron <b>manhole</b> covers (the usual material). The interior elevator doors were also cast in bronze, and areas in the floors in suites, meeting rooms, and some public areas had removable panels and built-in tubing which allowed for the easy replacement or upgrading of electrical, telecommunications, and computer wiring. The cafeteria beneath the Dirksen Senate Office Building was doubled in size and extended beneath the Hart building, which allowed the public to use {{for the first time}} during lunch hours.|$|E

50|$|While {{the water}} quality in that area remains {{generally}} good, there is effluent from the Town of New Windsor's sewage treatment plant. In November 2003 the Riverkeeper environmental organization sued the town over discharge into the creek leaking from two <b>manholes</b> into the creek. It was settled in 2005 when the town agreed to repair the <b>manholes,</b> remediate the area and provide public access to the water.|$|R
40|$|<b>Manholes</b> {{and other}} {{underground}} structures commonly account for 25 - 30 % of infiltration {{and up to}} 70 % of inflow in sanitary sewer collection systems. These will cause sewer overflow and endanger the nearby environment. SprayWall is a spray-applied, cured-in-place method of construction and is primarily used in <b>manholes.</b> It uses urethane material that provides excellent corrosion resistance. SprayWall is structural and can withstand ground water loads on a long-term basis...|$|R
5000|$|Sewerage is the {{infrastructure}} that conveys sewage or surface runoff (stormwater, meltwater, rainwater) using sewers. It encompasses components such as receiving drains, <b>manholes,</b> pumping stations, storm overflows, and screening chambers {{of the combined}} sewer or sanitary sewer. Sewerage ends at the entry to a sewage treatment plant or {{at the point of}} discharge into the environment. It is the system of pipes, chambers, <b>manholes,</b> etc. that conveys the sewage or storm water.|$|R
