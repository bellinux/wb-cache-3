5|$|Thelephora palmata is an ectomycorrhizal species, forming mutualistic {{associations}} with conifers. Fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or in {{groups on the}} ground in both coniferous and <b>mixed</b> <b>forest</b> and grassy fields. A preference has been noted for moist ground, and locations along woodland paths. An uncommon species, fruit bodies can be difficult to see because they blend well into their surroundings.|$|E

5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Hygrocybe appalachianensis grow singly, in groups, or {{clusters}} on the ground.

5|$|Thelephora palmata (commonly {{known as}} the stinking earthfan or the fetid false coral) is a species of clavarioid fungus in the family Thelephoraceae. The fruit bodies are {{leathery}} and coral-like, with branches that are narrow at the base before widening out like a fan and splitting into numerous flattened prongs. The wedge-like tips are whitish when young, but darken as the fungus matures. The common names of the fungus refers to its pungent odor, likened to fetid garlic. A widely distributed but uncommon species, it is found in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America, where it fruits {{on the ground in}} both coniferous and <b>mixed</b> <b>forest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Biomes {{are larger}} units of {{organization}} that categorize {{regions of the}} Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation. There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include tropical rainforest, temperate broadleaf and <b>mixed</b> <b>forest,</b> temperate deciduous forest, taiga, tundra, hot desert, and polar desert. Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic microbiomes. To a microbe, {{the human body is}} a habitat and a landscape. Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in molecular genetics, which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet. The oceanic microbiome plays {{a significant role in the}} ecological biogeochemistry of the planet's oceans.|$|E
5|$|The black-throated gray warbler breeds in open {{coniferous}} and <b>mixed</b> <b>forest</b> with a brushy understory, in dry open oak forests, and in chaparral {{and other}} scrubland. It is particularly associated with pinyon pines, junipers, and oaks. It migrates {{to the south}} late in the fall, returning north in mid-spring. While migrating, it forages in any woodland or scrub it passes through. In its wintering grounds, it occurs in dry woodland and tall scrub. Though its status is not well known, {{it does not appear}} to be seriously threatened by habitat destruction or other human activities, unlike many migratory warblers. It is a fairly common bird, among the most common in some localities. Because it is common and not in rapid decline, it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of its decommissioning, US16 started its run through Michigan at the Grand Trunk Western Railroad docks in Muskegon. The SS Milwaukee Clipper {{operated}} as a car ferry across Lake Michigan, connecting Muskegon to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where US16 continued to the west. From the docks, US16 and M-46 traveled concurrently south and then east through downtown Muskegon. At Peck Street, US16 turned south along Business US31 (Bus. US31). These two highways ran concurrently out of town to the south through Muskegon Heights to Norton Shores. There, the business loop ended at US31, and US16 joined the I-196 freeway headed east. (Later, the I-96 and I-196 designations west of Grand Rapids would be flipped, but at the time leading up to US16's decommissioning in the state of Michigan, this had not yet been approved.) The I-196/US16 freeway traveled southeast of Norton Shores through woodlands in rural Muskegon County parallel to the former US16 routing through Fruitport to Nunica in Ottawa County. The freeway turned more directly east in Nunica past the eastern terminus of M-104, and continued through more <b>mixed</b> <b>forest</b> and grassland terrain to serve the communities of Coopersville and Marne.|$|E
5|$|North of Glennie, {{the highway}} passes Clear Lake as it {{continues}} through rural Alcona County. Near the West Branch of the Pine River, M-65 merges with M-72. The two trunklines run concurrently curving {{to the northwest}} past the eastern terminus of county road F-32 into Curran. North of town, they separate as M-72 turns westward and M-65 continues north, exiting the Huron National Forest. The highway jogs along the AlconaâAlpena County line and crosses the Beaver Creek in the process. The trunkline runs {{to the east of}} Beaver Lake as it runs north through <b>mixed</b> <b>forest</b> and fields toward the community of Lachine. Southeast of that town, M-65 turns eastward along M-32 for a short distance before turning north into town. North of Lachine, the highway crosses the Thunder Bay River near the community of Long Rapids. As M-65 runs through the northern portion of Alpena County, it runs through the Mackinaw State Forest. The highway passes through the community of Posen in eastern Presque Isle County. The road continues due north to its terminus at an intersection with US23; the junction is inland from Lake Huron near Big and Little Trout lakes southeast of Rogers City.|$|E
