40|$|The {{effect of}} {{magnetic}} modulation on thermodynamic properties of a graphene monolayer in {{presence of a}} constant perpendicular magnetic field is reported here. One-dimensional spatial electric or magnetic modulation lifts the degeneracy of the Landau levels and converts into bands and their band width oscillates with magnetic field leading to Weiss-type oscillation in the thermodynamic properties. The effect of magnetic modulation on thermodynamic properties of a graphene sheet is studied and then compared with electrically <b>modulated</b> graphene and <b>magnetically</b> <b>modulated</b> conventional two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG). We observe Weiss-type and de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations at low and high magnetic field, respectively.

40|$|Introduction and background] Nowadays, we are {{surrounded}} by sensors in our daily lives, in industrial processes, medical diagnosis systems, environmental monitoring, etc. The development of sensors with higher sensitivity and smaller dimensions to be integrated in miniaturized systems is then of highest importance for our society. Within {{all different kinds of}} sensors, optical sensors are advantageous because they are highly versatile, non-invasive and they can be used in aggressive conditions. In particular, sensors based on surface plasmons, known as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors, have become increasingly popular in biosensing in recent decades due to their high sensitivity and ease of use. Different SPR configurations, such as modulation techniques, have been proposed and demonstrated in order to increase their sensitivity, and attempts to obtain miniaturized SPR sensors have been carried out, the development of plasmonic interferometry sensors being a promising path. [Main results] We have compared theoretically the performance of three implementations of plasmonic sensors: the standard SPR configuration, plasmonic interferometry and <b>magnetically</b> <b>modulated</b> plasmonic (magnetoplasmonic) interferometry. Our results show that the sensitivity of plasmonic interferometers surpasses that of standard SPR methods for long enough except the micrometer-sized interferometers. Moreover, when plasmonic interferometers are <b>magnetically</b> <b>modulated,</b> the direct measurement of the induced modulation in the surface plasmon wavevector allows one to further increase the system sensitivity. [Wider implications] These results show that the development of plasmonic interferometers for sensing, either plain or <b>magnetically</b> <b>modulated,</b> is an interesting route to obtain miniaturized surface plasmon based sensors with higher sensitivity. Moreover, the extended knowledge of immobilization protocols in gold already developed for standard SPR sensors will remain applicable.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the electrical transport properties of Dirac electrons in a monolayer graphene sheet {{in the presence of}} a perpendicular magnetic field that is modulated weakly and periodically along one direction. We find that the Landau levels broaden into bands and their width oscillates as a function of the band index and the magnetic field. We determine the σ_yy component of the magnetoconductivity tensor for this system which is shown to exhibit Weiss oscillations. We also determine analytically the asymptotic expressions for σ_yy. We compare these results with recently obtained results for electrically modulated graphene as well as those for <b>magnetically</b> <b>modulated</b> conventional two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) system. We find that in the <b>magnetically</b> <b>modulated</b> graphene system cosidered in this work,Weiss oscillations in σ_yy have a reduced amplitude compared to the 2 DEG but are less damped by temperature while they have a higher amplitude than in the electrically modulated graphene system. We also find that these oscillations are out of phase by π with those of the electrically modulated system while they are in phase with those in the 2 DEG system.

The Berry phase makes this hexagonal lattice structure behave differently than other two-dimensional fermionic systems. It causes a significant valley polarization in magnetoconductivity.
