60|$|MRS. ALLONBY. Ah, <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sort of {{promissory}} note; I'm {{tired of}} meeting him.|$|E
60|$|But <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sot, a fool, and {{one that}} hath not wit enough to follow his outward {{employment}} in the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "We’ll have a jolly time," [...] said Mrs. Cluffins. [...] "I often wish <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{seafaring}} man. A {{wife does}} have more freedom, doesn’t she?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you do fish at home," [...] I said to Jone, not wishing the English gentleman {{to think}} <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> city man, who didn't know {{anything}} about sport.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, sir,' {{returned}} Mrs. Sparsit. 'It {{was once}} my {{good or ill}} fortune, {{as it may be}} - before I became a widow - to move in a very different sphere. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Powler.' ...|$|R
6000|$|MABEL. [Staring at him] How {{can you do}} it? What do you want? What's your motive? You can't {{possibly}} {{believe that}} <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> thief! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have come," [...] she answered, [...] "because of these." [...] And {{she handed}} him two letters. [...] "I have come to {{ascertain}} if they are true; if <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> doubly perjured or a basely slandered man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I were to {{tell you}} everything--" [...] she stopped and smiled. [...] "It would take too long," [...] she concluded. [...] "I married when I was thirty, and I have two children. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> scholar. And now--it's your turn," [...] she nodded at Hirst.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Longstaff, I rather fancy that {{wherever}} I may be I {{can make}} a position for myself. At any rate I shall not marry with the view of getting one. If <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> English Duke I should think myself nothing, unless I was something as Isabel Boncassen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is <b>my</b> <b>husband.</b> He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{teamster}} {{until the}} big strike came. My name is Roberts, Saxon Roberts, and <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> William Roberts." ...|$|R
5000|$|Margulies has two {{collections}} of his cartoons published ...<b>My</b> <b>Husband</b> <b>is</b> Not <b>a</b> Wimp! (1988), and Hitting Below the Beltway (1998).|$|R
60|$|Elv. You know <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> man in years; but he's my husband, and {{therefore}} I shall be silent; but his humours are more intolerable than his age: he's grown so froward, so covetous, and so jealous, {{that he has}} turned my heart quite from him; and, if I durst confess it, has forced me to cast my affections on another man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Marie--Marie Bouchet. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fishmonger, or was, {{until one}} of those crusading priests got hold of him and took him off to kill Paynims and save his soul, much against my will. Well, I promised {{him that if he}} did not return in five years I would come to look for him. So here I am, but where he may be is another matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{do you not}} know," [...] {{she said}} hesitatingly, [...] "that <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> great invalid? It is a very painful subject for all of us, but we fear that his mind {{is not what it}} used to be. He has never been the same man since that awful night in the Solent. His work is more of a hobby with him; it would not be at all {{reliable}} for reference." ...|$|E
50|$|I was 18, and it {{was three}} months after I got married. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> jockey at Saratoga, and he told my father I'd left him and run off with beatniks. I was so pissed at him for telling! As far as I was concerned, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fake {{marriage}} {{to get me out}} of the house. I'd taken all our wedding presents back and bought books and records.|$|R
50|$|<b>My</b> <b>Husband's</b> Wives <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 1924 American silent drama film {{directed}} by Maurice Elvey and starring Shirley Mason. The film {{is considered to}} be lost.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> always <b>a</b> poor man, as you know. At {{the time}} of his death he left a small sum of money only. I <b>am,</b> as <b>a</b> matter of fact, greatly inconvenienced." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure," [...] she said, [...] "that {{you will}} not find it difficult. Tell me, cannot I help you in any way? I know the Duchess very well indeed--well enough {{to take you to}} call quite informally if you please. She is a great {{supporter}} of what they call the Primrose League here. I do not understand what it is all about, but it seems that I may not join because <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Radical." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do indeed," [...] she assented. [...] "There {{are many}} ties which still bind me to Austria--ties, Count," [...] she proceeded, looking {{him in the}} face, [...] "of which I shall be mindful. Yet I am not any longer the Baroness von Haase. I am Mrs. Francis Norgate, and I have promised to obey my husband in all manner of ridiculous things. At the same time, may I add {{something}} which will, perhaps, help you to accept the position with more philosophy? <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> friend of Herr Selingman's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That I cannot say, at present. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sailor, but I {{have not}} heard from {{him for a long}} time. At Arthenay there is but small {{opportunity}} of learning what happens outside, {{and it may be that}} I shall have to travel to Havre to obtain news of him; although I am troubled greatly by the fear that his ship has been lost, or captured by the English. We have never been in Paris before, and my brother naturally wishes to stay a short time, to see the sights." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> {{associate}} in business." [...] Josephine said, [...] "and apparently desires {{to take advantage}} of that fact. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> not <b>a</b> reliable person where money is concerned. He seems to have been behaving rather badly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not understand," [...] {{she said}} tentatively. [...] "How can my actions {{influence}} those of <b>my</b> <b>husband?</b> I <b>am</b> <b>a</b> prisoner in Boulogne: he probably is {{not aware of}} that fact yet and..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "I shall break my oath. Indeed, I have already broken it. Let {{me look at}} you, <b>my</b> <b>husband.</b> It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> strange thing to own after all these years--a husband." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God, I ain't {{really his}} wife! <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fine man--Mr. Kloh--Dlorus Kloh, my name is. Mr. Kloh's got {{a fine job}} with the mill, at North Yakima. Oh, I was a fool! This gambler Pinky Parrott, he comes along with his elegant ways, and he hands me out a swell line of gab, and I ups and leaves poor Kloh, and the kid, and the nicest kid---- Say, please, could you folks take me {{wherever}} you're going? Maybe I could get a job again--used to was a good waitress, and I ain't going to wait here any longer for that lying, cheating, mean-talking----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My father {{declares}} that I have degraded his noble blood by marrying a medical man. He forbade {{my mother to}} attend the ceremony. Poor simple soul! She asked me if I loved my young doctor, and was quite satisfied when I said Yes. As for my father's objections, <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> man of high promise in his profession. In his country--I think I told you in my last letter {{that he was a}} Frenchman--a famous physician is ennobled by the State. I shall leave no stone unturned, my dear, to push my husband forward. And when he is made a Baron, we shall see what my father will say to us then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must hear it--you {{have drawn}} {{it out of}} me. Come! we'll enjoy my humiliation together. Contradict every word I said {{to you about that}} brute and blackguard, the doctor--and you will have the truth. What horrid inconsistency, isn't it? I can't help myself; I am a wretched, {{unreasonable}} creature; I don't know my own mind for two days together, and all through my husband--I am so fond of him; Harry is delightfully innocent; he's like a nice boy; he never seemed to think of Mr. Vimpany, till it was settled between them that the doctor was to come and stay here----and then he persuaded me--oh, I don't know how!--to see his friend in quite a new light. I believed him--and I believe him still--I mean I would believe him, but for you. Will you do me a favour? I wish you wouldn't look at me with those eyes that won't lie; I wish you wouldn't speak to me with that voice which finds things out. Oh, good Heavens, do you suppose I would let you think that <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> bad man, and my marriage an unhappy one? Never! If it turns my blood to sit and eat at the same table with Mr. Vimpany, I'm not cruel enough to blame the dear doctor. It's my wickedness that's to blame. We shall quarrel, if you tell me that Harry is capable of letting a rascal be his friend. I'm happy; I'm happy; I'm happy!--do you understand that? Oh, Hugh, I wish you had never come to see me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] {{the lady}} said, {{speaking}} in English, [...] "I must claim {{you as a}} countryman, for I <b>am</b> Irish. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> officer in {{the army of the}} Duke of Lorraine; he <b>was</b> killed in <b>a</b> skirmish four years ago, and a year later I married the Baron of Blenfoix, and was again widowed at the battle of Freiburg, where <b>my</b> <b>husband,</b> who had followed the fortunes of the Duke of Lorraine, his feudal lord, fell fighting by the side of General Merci. This is my daughter Norah. But I see that you are wounded," [...] she went on as Hector bowed to the young lady.|$|R
6000|$|I clasp thy knees once more, and I do hope [...] Thou hast not cheated me!... Ah, now I see [...] Thy wicked arts! Because thou knewest well [...] <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> vassal of the empire, [...] That pardon {{which it}} was not thine to give [...] Thou didst pretend to promise me. O priest, [...] Is this thy pity? Sorrow gives me back [...] My {{wandering}} reason, and I waken on [...] The brink of an abyss; and from this wretch [...] The mask that did so hide his face drops down [...] And shows it in its naked hideousness [...] Unto the light of truth.|$|R

6000|$|... "No wonder, no wonder," [...] {{said the}} other; [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> French name. <b>My</b> second <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Frenchman. A great cook, Michael,--a Frenchman. But the English {{of the name}} is flower, and {{you can call me}} Mrs. Flower. You can surely {{remember}} that, Michael." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Presty {{denied it}} positively. [...] "No, Mr. Sarrazin, I don't get {{at it in}} that way. I merely consult my {{experience}} of another official person of high rank, {{and apply it to}} the Lord President. You know that <b>my</b> first <b>husband</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Cabinet Minister?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose so," [...] she said, in low and oddly uneven tones; [...] "but {{that depends}} upon you. I'll be as honest as you <b>were.</b> I {{poisoned}} <b>my</b> <b>husband.</b> I <b>am</b> <b>a</b> self-made widow. A man cannot love a murderess. So I suppose that ends our acquaintance." ...|$|R
