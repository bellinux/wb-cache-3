25|$|Soon I found <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> {{the main}} bandstand before this {{enormous}} crowd, Laine recalled. I was really nervous, but I started singing 'Beside an Open Fireplace,' a popular {{song of the}} day. It was a sentimental tune and the lyrics choked me up. When I got done, the tears were streaming down my cheeks and the ballroom became quiet. I was very nearsighted and couldn't see the audience. I thought that the people didn't like me.|$|E

Les having used guitar on his bass tracks with Mary earlier. On all their recordings (as good as they were), I always missed that deep dark sound... Mary (bless her heart) recorded {{a few of my}} compositions (never released), but she did an excellent job as always. Mary divorced Les Paul and later married her old school friend from Monrovia, California, namely Don Hatfield, who owned a large construction company in California. He is still with us, and I see him occasionally. Doing great, but he misses Mary.|$|E

25|$|Inevitably, I {{made up my}} mind to {{read the}} scripts of a foreign country. Around that time I went to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I was at the time {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were there that I would read them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I simply wanted to hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.|$|E

500|$|By contrast, The A.V. Club Evan Rytlewski {{wrote that}} the song opens Looking 4 <b>Myself</b> <b>on</b> a [...] "discouragingly {{perfunctory}} note", though complimented Usher for not using auto-tune to alter his vocals. Idolator's Robbie Daw was ambivalent towards the track, writing that [...] "Scream" [...] contains [...] "a dance-pop formula you can hear when flipping to any pop station on the radio". Neon Limelight disproved the track as a whole for being generic, saying that the song is a disappointment compared to its previous single [...] "Climax". Melinda Newman of HitFix showed a similar opinion, also noting the track as generic.|$|E
500|$|... "Dive" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American recording artist Usher for his seventh studio album Looking 4 Myself (2012). It was written and produced by Rico Love, Jim Jonsin, Danny Morris and Frank Romano. [...] "Dive" [...] is a slow-paced R ballad with elements of pop music, with Usher making use of his falsetto range. Its lyrics use the metaphor of diving, which was interpreted by critics to discuss a commitment to a relationship. The song was announced by Usher via Twitter as the fifth single from Looking 4 <b>Myself</b> <b>on</b> August 21, 2012. It was released to urban radio on August 28, 2012.|$|E
500|$|While {{the bulk}} of the film was shot on 4:4:4 HDCAM, {{according}} to director Guggenheim, a vast array of different film formats were used: [...] "There’s 35mm and 16mm. A lot of the stuff on the farm I just shot <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> 8mm film. We used four Sony F950 HDCAMs for the presentation. We shot three different kinds of prosumer HD, both 30 and 24. There’s MiniDV, there’s 3200 black-and-white stills, there’s digital stills, some of them emailed on the day they were taken from as far off as Greenland. There was three or four different types of animation. One of the animators is from New Zealand and emailed me his work. There’s JPEG stuff." ...|$|E

500|$|In March 1984, {{the film}} began {{production}} in Los Angeles. Cameron felt that with Schwarzenegger on the set, {{the style of}} the film changed, explaining that [...] "the movie took on a larger-than-life sheen. I just found <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> the set doing things I didn't think I would do– scenes that were just purely horrific that just couldn't be, because now they were too flamboyant." [...] Most of The Terminators action scenes were filmed at night, which led to tight filming schedules before sunrise. A week before filming started, Linda Hamilton sprained her ankle, leading to a production change whereby the scenes in which Hamilton needed to run occurred as late as the filming schedule allowed. Hamilton's ankle was taped every day and she spent most of the film production in pain.|$|E
500|$|Mary Shelley lived a {{literary}} life. Her father {{encouraged her to}} learn to write by composing letters, and her favourite occupation as a child was writing stories. Unfortunately, all of Mary's juvenilia were lost when she ran off with Percy in 1814, and none of her surviving manuscripts can be definitively dated before that year. Her first published work is often {{thought to have been}} Mounseer Nongtongpaw, comic verses written for Godwin's Juvenile Library when she was ten and a half; however, the poem is attributed to another writer in the most recent authoritative collection of her works. Percy Shelley enthusiastically encouraged Mary Shelley's writing: [...] "My husband was, from the first, very anxious that I should prove myself worthy of my parentage, and enrol <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> the page of fame. He was forever inciting me to obtain literary reputation." ...|$|E
500|$|Diplo, Rico Love, Jim Jonsin, Salaam Remi and Max Martin {{were the}} first {{producers}} confirmed for Looking 4 <b>Myself</b> <b>on</b> March 2012. After Usher had attended the Coachella Music Festival, he worked with electronic music duo Empire of the Sun to produce the album's title track; he described the band's music as an [...] "incredible sound". The collaboration and the band's music inspired Usher to produce more experimental music, and to produce records with producers he normally wouldn't work with or admired. DJ and producer Diplo was one of them, and so both collaborated on the album's lead single, [...] "Climax". They discussed the concept throughout the song's development and how it relates to Usher's life, as Diplo [...] "tried to help realise these lyrics and feelings." [...] After conceiving some melody lines, they wrote the song in about an hour. Usher and Diplo worked on the song's production for two months, recording in studios in Los Angeles, New York, and Atlanta.|$|E

500|$|Aaron Ashmore plays Jimmy Olsen, Chloe's {{photographer}} boyfriend {{who works}} at the Daily Planet. Ashmore, a recurring guest in season six, became a regular cast member in season seven. He called his casting a welcome surprise: [...] "I auditioned for [...] and I put <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> tape. I hadn't heard anything, and a couple of weeks later, all of the sudden (sic), I got the call saying, 'You're going to Vancouver to start shooting Smallville.' It's a dream come true, really." [...] After three seasons on the series (two as a regular), Ashmore's character was killed off. Although Ashmore's Jimmy Olsen was murdered, he said his character was not the [...] "real" [...] Jimmy Olsen, his real name revealed to be Henry James Olsen. Jimmy's younger brother, who appears briefly in the season-eight finale, is intended to be the Jimmy who works with Clark and Lois. Ashmore returns as the younger Jimmy in the series finale.|$|E
500|$|MacFarlane {{has also}} {{appeared}} on news shows and late night television {{shows such as}} Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Late Show with David Letterman. On January 19, 2007, MacFarlane appeared on Countdown with Keith Olbermann on MSNBC to discuss Stephen Colbert's appearance on The O'Reilly Factor and Bill O'Reilly's return appearance on The Colbert Report. MacFarlane introduced the segment by saying in Stewie's voice [...] "Oh, wait Bill. Hold still, allow me to soil <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> you. Victory is mine!" [...] Three months later on March 24, 2007, MacFarlane was interviewed on Fox's Talkshow with Spike Feresten, and closed the show by singing the Frank Sinatra song [...] "You Make Me Feel So Young". He also provided Stewie's voice when he appeared as a brain tumor-induced hallucination to Seeley Booth in an episode of Bones, writing his own dialogue for the episode. On May 8, 2009, MacFarlane was a guest on Real Time with Bill Maher.|$|E
500|$|Napoleon {{embarked}} {{aboard the}} brig Épervier {{early in the}} morning of 15 July, and made his way out to the Bellerophon. As he approached, the 74-gun Superb, flying Vice-Admiral Hotham's flag, was sighted approaching. Concerned that the brig might not reach Bellerophon before the Superb arrived, and that consequently Hotham would take over and receive Napoleon himself, Maitland sent Bellerophons barge to collect the former Emperor and transfer him to the ship. At some point between 6 and 7 am, the barge pulled alongside Bellerophon and General Henri Gatien Bertrand climbed aboard, followed by Napoleon. The marines came to attention, and Napoleon walked to the quarterdeck, took his hat off to Maitland and in French announced [...] "I am come to throw <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> the protection of your Prince and your laws." [...] Maitland bowed in response. With the former emperor in custody aboard a British warship, the Napoleonic Wars were finally over. To maritime historian David Cordingly, this moment was Bellerophons [...] "crowning glory [...] six weeks after the battle of Waterloo,... Napoleon, trapped in Rochefort, surrendered to the captain of the ship that had dogged his steps for more than twenty years." ...|$|E

500|$|As [...] "Kenny", {{as he was}} {{sometimes}} known, grew, he did an increasing share of the farm work, later stating, [...] "I did my share—and it was a substantial share—in {{taking care of the}} 13acres... I do not remember that I particularly liked to get up at 3:30 in the morning." [...] Kenesaw began his off-farm career at age ten as a news delivery boy. [...] He left school at 15 after an unsuccessful attempt to master algebra; he then worked at the local general store. He left that job for a position as errand boy with the Vandalia Railroad. Landis applied for a job as a brakeman, but was laughingly dismissed as too small. He then worked for the Logansport Journal, and taught himself shorthand reporting, becoming in 1883 official court reporter for the Cass County Circuit Court. [...] Landis later wrote, [...] "I may not have been much of a judge, nor baseball official, but I do pride <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> having been a real shorthand reporter." [...] He served in that capacity until 1886. In his spare time, he became a prize-winning bicycle racer and played on and managed a baseball team. Offered a professional contract as a ballplayer, he turned it down, stating that he preferred to play for the love of the game.|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} that {{followed}} the premiere Renoir reduced the film's running time from its original 113 minutes to 100 minutes, then to 90 minutes and finally to 85 minutes. He told Margurite Renoir and Zwobada to cut the scenes that the audience had found the most upsetting. Renoir said he mostly cut his own scenes or dialogue [...] "as though I were ashamed, after this rebuff, of showing <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> the screen." [...] He later defended his own performance as being awkwardthe way Octave should have been. The reduction in length removed Octave's complexity and completely changed the character's motives {{at the end of the}} film. In the 85 minute version Octave does not intend to run away with Christine and merely lends André his coat for warmth before sending him out to the greenhouse. The omission of this plot point resulted in the misconception that the film has an alternative ending; this was first reported by Roger Manvell after he watched it at its London premiere in 1946. At one point Jean Jay told Renoir to restore the film to the 100-minute version [...] "to avoid commercial disaster", but none of the shorter versions improved its reception or attendance figures. When asked about the film's poor reception with audience members, Renoir said [...] "I thought I was gentle with them, and they thought I was laughing at them." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} a single was soon deemed a [...] "stupid idea" [...] by Cornell and dropped {{in favor of an}} EP or album. The album was {{recorded}} in only 15 days, produced by the band themselves. Gossard described the recording process as a [...] "non-pressure-filled" [...] situation, as there were no expectations or pressure coming from the record company. Eddie Vedder, who had flown up from San Diego to Seattle to audition for Ament, Gossard, and McCready to be the singer of a band initially billing themselves as Mookie Blaylock (so named for a basketball player but eventually settling on Pearl Jam), was at one of the Temple of the Dog rehearsals and ended up providing backing vocals. [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was still figuring out the vocals at practice when Vedder stepped in and filled in the blanks singing the low parts because he saw it was hard for Cornell, as Cornell later described it: [...] "He sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the way I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively." [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became Temple of the Dog's breakout single; it was also Vedder's first featured vocal on a record. On the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, Vedder stated; “That was the first time I heard <b>myself</b> <b>on</b> a real record. It could be one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever been on — or the most meaningful.” ...|$|E
