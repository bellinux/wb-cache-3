The plug has protruding pins or, in US terminology, blades (referred to as male) that fit into matching slots or holes (called female) in the sockets. A plug is defined in IEC 60050 as an accessory having pins designed to engage with the contacts of a socket-outlet, also incorporating means for the electrical connection and mechanical retention of flexible cables or cords; a plug does not contain components which modify the electrical output from the electrical input (except where a switch and/or fuse is provided {{as a means of}} disconnecting the output from input).

In this article, the term 'plug' is used in the sense defined by IEC 60050. Sockets are designed to prevent exposure of bare energised contacts. Sockets may also have protruding exposed contacts, but these are used exclusively for grounding (earthing).|$|E

50|$|A {{power strip}} (also {{known as an}} {{extension}} block, power board, power bar, plug board, trailing gang, trailing socket, plug bar, trailer lead, multi-socket, multiple socket, multiple outlet, polysocket and by many other variations) is a block of electrical sockets that attaches {{to the end of}} a flexible cable (typically with a <b>mains</b> <b>plug</b> on the other end), allowing multiple electrical devices to be powered from a single electrical socket. Power strips are often used when many electrical devices are in proximity, such as for audio, video, computer systems, appliances, power tools, and lighting. Power strips often include a circuit breaker to interrupt the electric current in case of an overload or a short circuit. Some power strips provide protection against electrical power surges. Typical housing styles may include strip, rack-mount, under-monitor and direct plug-in.|$|E

The product used nickel-cadmium batteries, lasted about 4-5 hours per charge, and could be charged roughly 1000 times before a significant loss in effectiveness.

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of bass amps in the 2010s can be powered solely by AC mains power, obtained by plugging the amp into a wall socket. Inexpensive practice amps may have the AC <b>mains</b> <b>plug</b> hardwired into the unit. Middle-priced to high-priced amplifiers typically have a removable cable and plug, as used with PC computer towers. The benefits of having a removable cable and plug {{is that if the}} cable becomes worn or damaged, a new cable can easily be replaced by a layperson. If a hardwired AC mains cable and plug becomes worn or damaged, a qualified technician or electrician will typically be required to replace the cable and plug. Most amps are designed to work for a single voltage. A small number of expensive bass amps designed for touring professionals have user-selectable voltage, which enables a bassist to play with same amp in North America and Europe. A small number of small combo amps can run on both AC mains power and battery power. This enables bassists to play outside where there is no access to power (e.g., for busking on the street). Amps that are battery powered may have a 12 volt input, enabling the unit to be connected to a car battery with alligator clips.|$|E

5000|$|A {{number of}} {{companies}} make combination preamplifier-DI units for electric bass, double bass, or for acoustic instruments which use piezoelectric pickups (e.g., a violin, acoustic guitar, mandolin, etc.). These units may be housed in a [...] "stompbox" [...] pedal format, in a small rackmount unit (often less than a full rack space), or in units designed to be clipped to a belt or attached to an instrument. These devices are often marketed as preamplifiers, even though they also contain DI box features. Preamplifiers for electric bass typically contain gain knobs, sometimes including an overdrive effect unit, equalizer knobs and, for some higher-end units, multiple channels (e.g., a [...] "clean" [...] channel and a [...] "dirty" [...] channel, with the latter containing an overdrive effect). Preamp-DI units for double bass and other acoustic instruments often omit the overdrive features, but add additional features that help to produce a good sound and tone for acoustic instruments, such as an audio compression effect, a phase inverter switch and a notch filter (the latter two features designed to help reduce unwanted audio feedback [...] "howls"). Preamp-DIs for acoustic instruments often include two channels and a simple mixer, to enable the player to use both a pickup and a condensor microphone. Some preamp-DIs provide phantom power, in case this is required to power a condenser microphone. Preamp-DI units may be battery powered, have an AC <b>mains</b> <b>plug,</b> or both.|$|E

[...] The pins of both round pin and rectangular pin plugs are arranged in a triangular fashion, the earth pin being the larger and longer pin at the apex.

Some older amps (and their re-issued versions) have a knob that controls a vibrato effect. The 1/4" [...] input jack is typically mounted {{on the front of}} the amplifier. In the simplest, least expensive amplifiers, this 1/4" [...] jack is the only jack on the amplifier. More expensive amplifiers may have a patch bay for multiple inputs and outputs, such as a pre-amp out (for sending to another guitar amplifier), an in jack to create an effects loop (when used with the pre-amp out jack), an external speaker output (for powering an additional speaker cabinet), and stereo RCA jacks or an 1/8" [...] jack, for connecting a CD player or MP3 player so that a player can practice along with recorded music.
