40|$|We {{determined}} the Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations in soil samples collected along the eight main outlet roads of Poznan. Samples were collected at distances of 1, 5, and 10 m from the roadway edges at depth intervals of 0 - 20 and 40 - 60 cm. The metal content was determined in seven grain size fractions. The highest metal concentrations {{were observed in}} the smallest fraction (< 0. 063 mm), which were up to four times higher than those in sand fractions. Soil Pb, Cu, and Zn (and {{to a lesser extent}} Ni, Cr, and Cd) all increased in relation to the geochemical background. At most sampling sites, metal concentrations decreased with increasing distance from roadway edges and increasing depth. In some locations, the accumulation of metals in soils appears to be strongly influenced by wind direction.

50|$|The {{primary reason}} {{for the use of}} {{isolated}} grounds (IG) is to provide a noise-free ground return, separate from the equipment grounding (EG) return. The EG circuit includes all of the <b>metal</b> conduit, <b>outlet</b> boxes, and <b>metal</b> enclosures that contain the wiring and must be grounded to provide a safe return path in case of fault currents. The IG provides an insulated, separate ground path for the ground reference in electronic equipment, such as computers, hospital equipment, and audio equipment. IG does not break ground loops, which can damage equipment like computers, printers, etc.. Interconnected computer equipment often benefits from single-point grounding. IG is only used with special equipment that require it. The IG is typically insulated and separate {{all the way back to}} the point of earth grounding rod outside of the building. The IG is NOT connected neutral or any other. Due to the installation of a separate, insulated conductor and the associated special outlets required, IG circuits are more expensive to install than standard power circuits.|$|R
40|$|Liquid metals {{based on}} gallium, such as {{eutectic}} gallium indium (EGaIn) and Galinstan, have been integrated as static components in microfluidic systems {{for a wide}} range of applications including soft electrodes, pumps, and stretchable electronics. However, there is also a possibility to continuously pump liquid metal into microchannels to create shape reconfigurable metallic structures. Enabling this concept necessitates a simple method to control dynamically the path the metal takes through branched microchannels with multiple outlets. This paper demonstrates a novel method for controlling the directional flow of EGaIn liquid metal in complex microfluidic networks by simply applying a low voltage to the metal. According to the polarity of the voltage applied between the inlet and an outlet, two distinct mechanisms can occur. The voltage can lower the interfacial tension of the metal via electrocapillarity to facilitate the flow of the <b>metal</b> towards <b>outlets</b> containing counter electrodes. Alternatively, the voltage can drive surface oxidation of the metal to form a mechanical impediment that redirects the movement of the metal towards alternative pathways. Thus, the method can be employed like a &# 039;valve&# 039; to direct the pathway chosen by the metal without mechanical moving parts. The paper elucidates the operating mechanisms of this valving system and demonstrates proof-of-concept control over the flow of liquid metal towards single or multiple directions simultaneously. This method provides a simple route to direct the flow of liquid metal for applications in microfluidics, optics, electronics, and microelectromechanical systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{the design}} of runner systems, ceramic foam filters are used for {{reducing}} the velocity of liquid metal {{in order to avoid}} so called “bifilm ” defect resulting from a high gating velocity (over its critical gating velocity) in aluminum gravity casting.

Furthermore, {{in order to understand the}} effect of the filters used in these systems, an aluminum sand casting experiment was conducted. The quality of the cast <b>metal</b> in the <b>outlet</b> area of the filter for these systems was investigated.

40|$|When {{evaluating}} {{the performance of}} new boosting hardware, {{it is a challenge}} to isolate the heat transfer effects inherent within measured turbine and compressor efficiencies. This work documents the construction of a lumped mass turbocharger model in the MatLab Simulink environment capable of predicting turbine and compressor <b>metal</b> and gas <b>outlet</b> temperatures based on measured or simulated inlet conditions. A production turbocharger from a representative 2. 2 L common rail diesel engine was instrumented to enable accurate gas and wall temperature measurements to be recorded under a variety of engine operating conditions. Initially steady-state testing was undertaken across the engine speed and load range in order that empirical Reynolds-Nusselt heat transfer relationships could be derived and incorporated into the model. Steady state model predictions were validated against further experimental data. Model predictions for compressor wall temperature show very good correlation with measured data (average 0. 4 % error, standard deviation 1. 27 %) and turbine housing temperatures also demonstrate good agreement (average 2. 7 % error, standard deviation 3. 58 %). The maximum compressor and turbine wall temperature errors were 2. 9 % and 8. 1 % respectively at the steady state validation test conditions. This work demonstrates that a relatively simple approach to modelling the heat transfer within turbochargers can generate accurate predictions of housing temperatures and the knock-on impact on compressor and turbine gas outlet temperatures...|$|R

40|$|A {{free water}} surface flow {{constructed}} wetland (CW) {{was designed to}} evaluate the capacity of this biological treatment system, which receives wastewater from aquaculture and upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors, to retain heavy metal. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the role of the sediment and the macrophytes Cyperus giganteus, Typha domingensis, Eichhornia crassipes, and Pontederia cordata in accumulating Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Mn, Pb, and Zn, during the dry (winter) and rainy (summer) seasons. In general, the concentrations and mass loading of heavy <b>metals</b> in the <b>outlet</b> water were lower than in the inlet water. The highest removal efficiency rates of water (mainly mass removal) occurred in the dry season. In the rainy season, the probable low oxygen level in the upper layer of sediment resulted in a release of reduced metals into the water because of organic matter mineralization and an increase in depth. This, coupled with an increase in the hydraulic loading rate (HLR), affected the efficiency removal in this season. The metals were especially immobilized as a result of the sedimentation process and could be removed weakly via macrophyte uptake, with the exception of Mn. In addition to the sediment, which is the main compartment for heavy metal retention in the CW system, the macrophytes have the advantage of being harvested. Therefore, E. crassipes and T. domingensis, which are good metal accumulators, can be recommended for the removal of heavy metals from agricultural wastewaters...|$|R
40|$|In this master thesis {{there has}} been studied {{possible}} effects from acidic, metalrich runoff on blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) in the Kaldvellfjord (Lillesand county), {{as a result of}} sulphide oxidation from deposits in the precipitation area with sulphide-containing bedrock. Blue mussels from 6 stations and two depths 1 and 5 m were investigated at different times in 2014. Al, Fe and Mn exhibited the highest concentrations during high freshwater runoffs in both water and blue mussels at 1 m depth. Also at 1 m depth, all investigated metal concentrations in water had positive correlations with runoff. For blue mussels most of the metals showed the same positive correlation pattern. The results were compared to the Norwegian pollution guidelines for metal concentrations in water and soft tissue from blue mussels. The median metal concentrations from the Kaldvellfjord showed polluted values, though the stream Stordalsbekken had periodically values within the most polluted category. Water samples from 1 m depth in the Kaldvellfjord showed significant higher concentrations than the samples from 5 m depth. The concentrations in blue mussels did not show any critical values, although higher concentrations were found in small mussels (20 - 35 mm) compared to big mussels (> 36 mm) in addition to the higher concentrations at 1 m compared to 5 m. High concentration inputs of inorganic dissolved Al from strongly acidified streams are the factor of most biological concern for this fjord, especially near the fresh water outlets. When the fjord with high pH and poor metal concentrations is supplied with metal rich freshwater with low pH, several metals will start to polymerize and precipitate. Among metals, aluminum is known to be very toxic to many gill-breathing organisms during polymerization/precipitation conditions. This may be the reason for the blue mussel mortality seen near acidic, <b>metal</b> rich stream <b>outlets</b> in the Kaldvellfjord. As polymerization/precipitation are very unstable processes, it is difficult to both measure and model the actual chemical conditions. During conditions like this, the use of different bio-monitors like blue mussels is essential for the ability to verify the actual biological effect of various pollutions in the environment. During conditions like this, biological monitoring programs will be of high importance as a background reference in an effect evaluation...|$|R
40|$|The Supercritical Carbon Dioxide (S-CO{sub 2 }) Brayton Cycle is a {{promising}} alternative to Rankine steam cycle and recuperated gas Brayton cycle energy converters {{for use with}} Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactors (SFRs), Lead-Cooled Fast Reactors (LFRs), {{as well as other}} advanced reactor concepts. The S-CO{sub 2 } Brayton Cycle offers higher plant efficiencies than Rankine or recuperated gas Brayton cycles operating at the same liquid <b>metal</b> reactor core <b>outlet</b> temperatures as well as reduced costs or size of key components especially the turbomachinery. A new Plant Dynamics Computer Code has been developed at Argonne National Laboratory for simulation of a S-CO{sub 2 } Brayton Cycle energy converter coupled to an autonomous load following liquid metal-cooled fast reactor. The Plant Dynamics code has been applied to investigate the effectiveness of a control strategy for the S-CO{sub 2 } Brayton Cycle for the STAR-LM 181 MWe (400 MWt) Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor. The strategy, which involves a combination of control mechanisms, is found to be effective for controlling the S-CO{sub 2 } Brayton Cycle over the complete operating range from 0 to 100 % load for a representative set of transient load changes. While the system dynamic analysis of control strategy performance for STARLM is carried out for a S-CO{sub 2 } Brayton Cycle energy converter incorporating an axial flow turbine and compressors, investigations of the S-CO{sub 2 } Brayton Cycle have identified benefits from the use of centrifugal compressors which offer a wider operating range, greater stability near the critical point, and potentially further cost reductions due to fewer stages than axial flow compressors. Models have been developed at Argonne for the conceptual design and performance analysis of centrifugal compressors for use in the SCO{sub 2 } Brayton Cycle. Steady state calculations demonstrate the wider operating range of centrifugal compressors versus axial compressors installed in a S-CO{sub 2 } Brayton Cycle as well as the benefits in expanding the range over which individual control mechanisms are effective for cycle control. However, a combination of mechanisms is still required for control of the S-CO{sub 2 } Brayton Cycle between 0 and 100 % load. An effort is underway to partially validate the Argonne models and codes by means of comparison with data from tests carried out using the small-scale Sandia Brayton Loop (SBL) recuperated gas closed Brayton cycle facility. The centrifugal compressor model has been compared with data from the SBL operating with nitrogen gas and good agreement is obtained between calculations and the measured data for the compressor outlet pressure versus flow rate, although it is necessary to assume values for certain model parameters which require information about the configuration or dimensions of the compressor components that is unavailable. Unfortunately, the compressor efficiency cannot be compared with experiment data {{due to the lack of}} outlet temperature data. A radial inflow turbine model has been developed to enable further comparison of calculations with data from the SBL which incorporates both a radial inflow turbine as well as a radial compressor. Preliminary calculations of pressure ratio and efficiency versus flow rate have been carried out using the radial inflow turbine model...|$|R
