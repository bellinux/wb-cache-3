5|$|Construction of the {{new stadium}} {{commenced}} on 23 April 2007, with the first sod being turned by Malmö FF chairman Bengt Madsen, Malmö Municipality chairman Ilmar Reepalu, club captain Daniel Andersson, and two former players: Daniel's brother Patrik, and their father Roy. The ground was designed by FOJAB Arkitekter, in collaboration with Berg Arkitektkontor, which also designed Friends Arena, the Swedish national stadium, which is in Solna. The <b>main</b> <b>constructor</b> for the new Malmö FF stadium was Peab. Its budget was ultimately heavily exceeded: Peab announced in 2009 that it would cost 695million kronor instead of the original 399million. The extra amount was explained as being down to miscalculations in the original budget, as well as additions made to the plans {{since the start of}} construction, which Peab reasoned made the original budget no longer entirely valid. Malmö FF announced on 12 July 2007 that they had sold the naming rights for the stadium to Swedish bank Swedbank, for a ten-year period, starting on the ground's opening. Between 2009 and 2013 the naming rights to stands inside the stadium were sold to different sponsors. At the start of the 2014 season the sponsor names of the stands were removed and the advertisement placements in front of each stand were sold to the club's largest sponsors. The graphical profile of the advertisement was also given a light blue background with white text to adhere to the club's colours. The ground's inauguration game was played several months before, on 13 April 2009, against Örgryte IS. Malmö FF won the game 3–0, and the first goal was scored by midfielder Labinot Harbuzi. All facilities related to football were completed by this time, but the office space and some exterior work was yet to be done. This was finished in late 2009. The completed building was 27 meters tall, 150 meters wide, and 215 meters in length.|$|E

The <b>main</b> <b>constructors</b> in this language are the objects. An object {{consists of a}} state, a behaviour {{and a set of}} transition rules between states. The specification is composed by three sections: definition of algebraic data types to represent the domain of object attributes, definition of classes that group objects with common features, and definition of relationships among classes. We show two possible styles for defining the behaviour of objects, in one hand we use a transition system (state oriented) and in the other hand we use an algebraic model of processes description (constraint oriented). We illustrate the paper with the specification of the dining philosophers problem, a typical example in distributed programming...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was to study the three Arctic Provinces: the Timan-Pechora Basin, the Sverdrup Basin and the Barents Sea, and make a comparison between them {{with a focus on}} the Paleozoic sediments and their potential as reservoirs based on published literature. The Upper Paleozoic carbonate reefal structures of the Timan-Pechora Basin have been proven as good reservoirs for hydrocarbon accumulation, while similar carbonate buildups of the Sverdrup Basin and the Barents Sea are still considered to be prospective. All the three provinces were at similar latitudes in Late Paleozoic time; and they included similar paleoenvironment with similar biota that were the <b>main</b> <b>constructors</b> of the carbonate buildups. However, considering the reservoir potential, another important process {{must be taken into account}} &# 150; diagenesis. Paleozoic carbonate buildups in the selected provinces experienced prolonged or repeated periods of subaerial exposure that resulted in leaching, karstification and dolomitization, which are processes that enhance the porosity. It can be concluded that the Paleozoic carbonate reefal structures are important targets for future petroleum exploration in the Arctic. </p...|$|R

40|$|Carbonate buildups and mounds are {{impressive}} biogenic structures throughout Earth history. In the recent NE Atlantic, cold-water coral (CWC) reefs form giant carbonate mounds {{of up to}} 300 [*]m of elevation. The expansion of these coral carbonate mounds is paced by climatic changes during the past 2. 7 [*]Myr. Environmental control on their development is directly linked to controls on its <b>main</b> <b>constructors,</b> the reef-building CWCs. Seawater density {{has been identified as}} one of the main controlling parameter of CWC growth in the NE Atlantic. One possibility is the formation of a pycnocline above the carbonate mounds, which is increasing the hydrodynamic regime, supporting elevated food supply, and possibly facilitating the distribution of coral larvae. The potential to reconstruct past seawater densities from stable oxygen isotopes of benthic foraminifera has been further developed: a regional equation gives reliable results for three different settings, peak interglacials (e. g., Holocene), peak glacials (e. g., Last Glacial Maximum), and intermediate setting (between the two extremes). Seawater densities are reconstructed for two different NE Atlantic CWC carbonate mounds in the Porcupine Seabight indicating that the development of carbonate mounds is predominantly found at a seawater density range between 27. 3 and 27. 7 [*]kg[*]m− 3 (σΘ notation). Comparable to recent conditions, we interpret the reconstructed density range as a pycnocline serving as boundary layer, on which currents develop, carrying nutrition and possibly coral larvae. The close correlation of CWC reef growth with reconstructed seawater densities through the Pleistocene highlights the importance of pycnoclines and intermediate water mass dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Evolution and advancements {{of human}} {{activity}} is unstoppable, still we should not forget about basic natural processes which proceed no matter how man can influence them. Water {{is one of the}} <b>main</b> <b>constructors</b> of life and is necessary for function of everything live on the planet Earth. It often is categorized among the inexhaustible resources, still there lacks enough drinkable water. It is consumption grows in recent years with fast development of cities. It is {{the most important part of}} life on Earth and with urbanization and anthropogenic interference water is negatively affected and thus it is processes in nature. Interfering with water cycle makes for higher occurrences of droughts and floods, the quality of water streams suffers. Urban areas lack the surface where water could soak into the subsoil and underground water resources shrink. Through all these influences with which we affect natural water cycles the need for water and its consumption grows in our societies. For effective use of water comes up the idea of using not only the drinkable water but waste water and other types as well. Sources can be various, rain water, reused water. The focal point of this thesis is to be the impetus of discussion concerning the use of rain water and directly cleaning and reusing the water which comes straight from our homes. Rain water fills up underground water resources and also could be used in place of potable water. Substituting the potable water in activities and industries where such a high quality water is not needed and could be easily replaced with grey water. Grey water, being the waste water that comes from our bathrooms, is easily cleaned and can be used for various necessities. Current state where the potable water is used in absolute majority of human life appears to be extremely wasteful and unecological. Use of grey water and rain water is a possibility of ecological and thrifty water management which could prevent environmental damages and save water resources for the next generations...|$|R

50|$|Bloudek {{was engaged}} as {{a pioneer of}} flight. In 1910, when in Prague, he {{presented}} his first monoplane called Racek ('Gull'). A second one named Libela ('dragonfly') followed in the next year. For some time he worked together with Igo Etrich, inventor of the Etrich Taube. Before World War I, he was employed in Trutnov, today in the Czech Republic. At that time, he became interested in skiing. After the end of World War I, Bloudek moved to his mother's home in Ljubljana, and he lived in Ljubljana until his death. There he was also busy in developing flight, and he also showed interest in improving cars. In the 1920s, he and the Ljubljana Aeroclub constructed another monoplane, named Sraka ('Magpie'), and then a two-seat aircraft, named Bloudek XV (nicknamed Lojze). He ceased his work in 1934, when a test pilot of his plane, Janez Colnar, died during an airshow in Zagreb.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the functional role of <b>main</b> benthic <b>constructor</b> organisms and reviews {{processes by which}} bioconstructions increase diversity and abundance of associated biota, and the reverse. Based on the literature, patterns of diversity of carbonate bryozoan bioconstructions, {{one of the most}} important groups performing important constructional roles, have been analysed. Diversity of bryozoan bioconstructors seems not to follow the latitudinal gradient, from tropics to increasing distance from tropics, recognised for coral bioconstructors. The only case of a high diversity bryozoan reef (Joulters Cays, Bahamas) represents a situation virtually unique in carbonate environments. Dimension and extension of bryozoan bioconstructions show their maximum in temperate environments, where seasonality or variability of environmental parameters could afford advantages for success to bryozoans. With only one exception (the bryozoan-serpulid build-ups from South Australia), diversity of biota associated with bryozoan bioconstructions is high, but comparison is not possible due to the fact that exhaustive faunal studies are rare, sometimes referring only to one taxon, and environments differing in depth range, salinity, hydrodynamics, trophic diversity, etc. are involved...|$|R

Strategies are adopted based on the intent and type of information being sought within perceived boundaries of time and accuracy required. Techniques used to implement these strategies include networking, branching/filtering, and cost-saving. The implementation of the strategies varied with experience, with novices using a more limited range of strategies and techniques than experienced constructors...|$|R

It also expounds the dominant position of duplex main body in new village construction, wherein the government is the main body which administers public power in the field of public power in new village construction, while the farmer is the main body who administers private rights in the field of non-public rights in new village construction. It generalizes and unravels the role of duplex main body of farmers and government in new village construction, and analyzes the relationship of role of duplex main body between government and farmers as follows: the government dominates over rural development, and the government, as main body, plays dominant role in the field of rural public power and construction of social environment, while the farmers are <b>main</b> participators and <b>constructors,</b> who play significant role; in construction of rural non-public power field, the farmers play the role of main body, and the government plays me role of guidance and service.

50|$|The club's {{directors}} {{now considered}} constructing {{an entirely new}} stadium in Malmö. Plans for such a ground were first mooted in 2001, but were not fully considered {{until the end of}} 2004, when the team won Allsvenskan {{for the first time since}} 1989. Malmö Municipality announced on 25 April 2005 its intention to either help the club renovate Malmö Stadion, or build a new stadium in the same area. Four days later, five different scenarios were laid out by the City of Malmö: the first proposed the construction of an entirely new, football-specific stadium to the south of Malmö Stadion, while the second suggested the demolition of Malmö Stadion, and the erection of a new ground for football and athletics on the same site. The third, fourth, and fifth ideas all proposed the building of two stadiums, one for football and one for athletics, on various local plots. The municipality chose the first option on 3 December 2005: the new football ground would be built south of Malmö Stadion, with a capacity of 20,000 to 25,000, on a 399 million kronor budget. Malmö Stadion, meanwhile, would be renovated into an athletics stadium for 50 million kronor.Construction of the new stadium commenced on 23 April 2007, with the first sod being turned by Malmö FF chairman Bengt Madsen, Malmö Municipality chairman Ilmar Reepalu, club captain Daniel Andersson, and two former players: Daniel's brother Patrik, and their father Roy.

40|$|The thesis {{addresses}} the economic impacts of construction safety in Greece. The research involved {{the development of}} a methodology for determining the overall costs of safety, namely the sum of the costs of accidents and the costs of safety management failures (with or without accident) including image cost. Hitherto, very little work has been published on the cost of accidents in practical case studies. Moreover, to the author’s belief, no research has been published that seeks to determine in real cases the costs of prevention. The methodology developed is new, transparent, and capable of being replicated and adapted to other employment sectors and to other countries. The methodology was applied to three construction projects in Greece to test the safety costing methodology and to offer some preliminary evidence on the business case for safety. The survey work took place between 1999 and 2001 and involved 27 months of costing work on site. The study focuses on the overall costs of safety that apply to the main (principal) contractor. The methodology is supported by 120 discrete cost categories, and systematic criteria for determining which costs are included (counted) in the overall cost of safety. A quality system (in compliance with ISO 9000 series) was developed to support the work and ensure accuracy of data gathering. The results of the study offer some support for the business case for safety. Though they offer good support for the economics of safety as they demonstrate need for cost effectiveness. Subject to important caveats, those projects that appeared to manage safety more cost-effectively achieved the lowest overall safety cost. Nevertheless, results are significantly lower than of other published works for two main reasons; first costs due to damages with no potential to injury were not included and second only costs to <b>main</b> <b>constructor</b> were considered. Study’s results are discussed and compared with other publish works. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
