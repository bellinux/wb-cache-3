5|$|Care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> {{to avoid}} the {{accumulation}} of amounts of plutonium which approach critical mass, particularly because plutonium's critical mass is {{only a third of}} that of uranium-235. A critical mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and gamma rays. Plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water.|$|E
5|$|However, poison {{still exists}} as a murderous entity today, {{but it is}} not as popular form of {{conducting}} murder {{as it used to be}} in past times, probably because of the wider range of ways to kill people and other factors that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> into consideration. One of the more recent deaths by poisoning was that of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 from lethal polonium-210 radiation poisoning.|$|E

5|$|Multiple {{data sets}} may be {{necessary}} for certain phasing methods. For example, MAD phasing requires that the scattering be recorded at least three (and usually four, for redundancy) wavelengths of the incoming X-ray radiation. A single crystal may degrade too much during the collection of one data set, owing to radiation damage; in such cases, data sets on multiple crystals <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken.</b>|$|E

5|$|An {{alignment}} {{is calculated}} {{by measuring the}} azimuth, the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces The azimuth is usually measured using a theodolite or a compass. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its magnetic declination <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> into account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.|$|E
5|$|At {{an archaeological}} dig in the Ecuadorian highlands, two archaeologists, Dr. Bilac and Dr. Roosevelt, {{get into an}} {{argument}} over the removal of a burial urn that contains an Amaru, or a female shaman. Roosevelt argues that the urn <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> from the site and preserved in a museum, much {{to the chagrin of}} Bilac and the tribespeople present. Later, a native shaman distributes Yaje to the local villagers and Bilac. During this ritual, a jaguar spirit kills Roosevelt in his tent.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of the different scales means that care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> when comparing large numbers between languages or countries, or when interpreting old documents in countries where the dominant scale has changed over time. For example, British English, French, and Italian historical documents can refer to either the short or long scale, depending on {{the date of the}} document, since each of the three countries has used both systems at various times in its history. Today, the United Kingdom officially uses the short scale, but France and Italy use the long scale.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was done in}} density stage stands of of spruce in nearly 15 hectare in Kapuköy suburb of Maçka Forest District that regenerated in different periods. 1. 30 m. diameter, height, age and the longest subterminal branches of the trees in four direction were established on five trees which were most closive to the 60 points that were confirmed by systematic sampling. 1. 30 m. diameter-canopy square and height-canopy square graphics were formed according to these datums. By the help of these graphics two tables were developed. One of these table was arranged according to the diameter levels with 1 cm. periods {{and the other was}} arranged according to the height levels with 0. 50 m. periods. Each table shows the covered area of each tree and the numbers of the trees that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>take</b> place in an hectare after tending, according to the diameter levels and height levels. With this research, it is suggested that in density stage spruce stands, in every 4 - 6 years, there <b>must</b> <b>be</b> tending cuttings in three times and the numbers of the trees that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>take</b> place in an hectare with a decrease from thin diameter stage to thick diameter stage <b>must</b> <b>be</b> 9188 in the stands that have 1 cm breast height and 970 in the stands that have 14 cm breast height. On the other hand it is suggested that with a decrease from low heights to high heigths the number of the trees that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>take</b> place in an hectare <b>must</b> <b>be</b> 9900 in the stands that have 1. 50 m height and 1302 in the stands that have 7. 50 m height...|$|R

5|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of electricity produced worldwide is used immediately, since storage is usually more expensive and because traditional generators can adapt to demand. However both solar power and wind power are variable renewable energy, meaning that all available output <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> whenever it is available by moving through transmission lines to {{where it can be}} used now. Since solar energy is not available at night, storing its energy is potentially an important issue particularly in off-grid and for future 100% renewable energy scenarios to have continuous electricity availability.|$|E
5|$|Black convinces Birckenbeuhl {{to confess}} {{publicly}} to the hit-and-run, {{in order to}} have his son returned. Birckenbeuhl does so, but continues to maintain his innocence in private. Charlie is not returned, however; instead, a cassette is sent to Birckenbuehl by the killer, who explains that since Birckenbeuhl took a life, one <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> from him in return. Black is able to deduce from the background noise on the tape that Charlie is being held near the local high school's swimming pool. The boy is rescued, and killer—Edward Petey—is found and arrested. However, the elder Birckenbeuhl is found hanged in his bedroom, driven to suicide by his guilt.|$|E
5|$|Donna Lee Brien {{stated that}} just as the filmmakers {{attempted}} {{to distance themselves from}} Leigh's murder, the city of Newcastle attempted to distance itself from Blackrock. A 1999 feature in The Sydney Morning Herald discussing cinematic production in Newcastle mentioned everything from Mel Gibson's 1977 debut film Summer City to a short film festival that year, but made no mention of Blackrock. Brien theorised that some of the condemnation the film received may have been due to public frustration with the legal system, as the film achieves justice for the victim, whereas no one was ever convicted of raping Leigh. Brien cited the film as an example of why sensitivity and care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> when fictionalising an actual crime.|$|E

5|$|Early {{researchers}} tasted beryllium and {{its various}} compounds for sweetness {{in order to}} verify its presence. Modern diagnostic equipment no longer necessitates this highly risky procedure and no attempt {{should be made to}} ingest this highly toxic substance. Beryllium and its compounds should be handled with great care and special precautions <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> when carrying out any activity which could result in the release of beryllium dust (lung cancer is a possible result of prolonged exposure to beryllium-laden dust). Although the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.|$|E
5|$|Glass {{can also}} be welded to metals and ceramics, {{although}} with metals the process is usually more adhesion {{to the surface of}} the metal rather than a commingling of the two materials. However, certain glasses will typically bond only to certain metals. For example, lead glass bonds readily to copper or molybdenum, but not to aluminum. Tungsten electrodes are often used in lighting but will not bond to quartz glass, so the tungsten is often wetted with molten borosilicate glass, which bonds to both tungsten and quartz. However, care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to ensure that all materials have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent cracking both when the object cools and when it is heated again. Special alloys are often used for this purpose, ensuring that the coefficients of expansion match, and sometimes thin, metallic coatings may be applied to a metal to create a good bond with the glass.|$|E
5|$|Older {{models that}} used tube power {{amplifiers}} {{used a variety}} of 6-pin connectors, while later models used a 9-pin connector. In all cases, for a single organ – Leslie configuration, the mains power, audio and control signals are all carried on the connector, and the design of the pin layouts varies between organs and speakers. Care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> when attempting to service them since an incorrectly or poorly wired cable can cause permanent damage to the organ and / or speaker, or result in electrocution. It is also possible to connect multiple Leslie speakers to a single organ, by using a power relay that provides the necessary AC current.|$|E
