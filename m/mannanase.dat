Filamentous fungi secrete enzymes {{to break down}} complex substances in the environment into smaller molecules they can use for nutrition. Investigation of the enzymes secreted by a fungus {{can lead to a}} better understanding of how it survives in a natural habitat; furthermore, new enzymes with potential for industrial applications can be revealed. In this work, the enzyme activities of fungi from koala faeces were investigated. As a result of a diet of Eucalyptus leaves, koala faeces are composed of recalcitrant plant cell wall polymers (cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin and lignin). Consequently, fungi that grow on koala faeces hold high potential as sources of enzymes for efficient degradation of plant biomass. [...] Thirty-seven fungal strains were isolated from koala faeces, identified, and screened for enzyme activities using agar plate assays; over two-thirds of the isolates secreted xylanases, endoglucanases, ligninases and proteases, and over one-third secreted amylases, <b>mannanases</b> and tannases. The enzyme activities of seven isolates were comprehensively characterised using liquid cultures, liquid enzyme assays and zymography. Two isolates, Gelasinospora cratophora A 10 and Trichoderma atroviride A 2, were high secretors of protein and heat-tolerant enzymes. The lipase(s) from Mariannaea camptospora A 11 sustained activity at cool temperatures. The xylanase(s), <b>mannanase(s),</b> endoglucanase(s) and β-glucosidase(s) of Doratomyces stemonitis C 8 displayed optimal activities under neutral to alkaline conditions. Some of the enzymes hold potential for application in the production of paper, textiles, detergents and ethanol-based biofuels. [...] Finally, the secretome of D. stemonitis C 8 was studied by gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. As the genome of D. stemonitis has not been sequenced, the secretome analysis required cross-species identification and de novo sequencing; furthermore, a new technique was developed to identify proteins directly from zymogram gels by mass spectrometry.

For this purpose T. cellulosilytica TB 100 (T) type strain was chosen for de novo genome sequencing. We have assembled the genome of T. cellulosilytica strain TB 100 (T) into 168 contigs and 19 scaffolds, with reference length of 4 327 869 bps, 3 589 putative coding sequences, 53 tRNAs, and 4 rRNAs. The analysis of the annotated genome revealed the existence of 27 putative hydrolases belonging to 14 different glycoside hydrolase (GH) families. The investigation of identified, cloned, and heterologously multiple cellulases, <b>mannanases,</b> xylanases, and amylases may result in industrial applications beside gaining useful basic research related information...|$|R

To isolate gene(s) from P. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa encoding endo-beta- 1, 4 -mannanase (<b>mannanase)</b> activity, a genomic library of Pseudomonas DNA, constructed in lambda ZAPII, was screened for mannanase-expressing clones using the dye-labelled substrate, azo-carob galactomannan. The nucleotide sequence of the pseudomonad insert from a mannanase-positive clone revealed a single open reading frame of 1257 bp encoding a protein of M(r) 46, 938. The deduced N-terminal sequence of the putative polypeptide conformed to a typical prokaryotic signal peptide. Truncated derivatives of the <b>mannanase,</b> lacking 54 and 16 residues from the N- and C-terminus respectively of the mature form of the enzyme, did not exhibit catalytic activity. Inspection of the primary structure of the <b>mannanase</b> did not reveal any obvious linker sequences or protein motifs characteristic of the non-catalytic domains located in other Pseudomonas plant cell wall hydrolases. These data indicate that the <b>mannanase</b> is non-modulator, comprising a single catalytic domain. Comparison of the <b>mannanase</b> sequence with those in the SWISSPROT database revealed greatest sequence homology with the <b>mannanase</b> from Bacillus sp. Thus the Pseudomonas enzyme belongs to glycosyl hydrolase Family 26, a family containing mannanases and endoglucanases. Analysis of the substrate specificity of the <b>mannanase</b> showed that the enzyme hydrolysed mannan and galactomannan, but displayed little activity towards other polysaccharides located in the plant cell wall. The enzyme had a pH optimum of approx. 7. 0, was resistant to proteolysis and had an M(r) of 46, 000 when expressed by Escherichia coli...|$|E

The abundance of <b>mannanase</b> waste is potential for the production of functional foods such as Manno oligosaccharides. Sago hump which is sago processing waste is very potential for growth of microorganisms because it contains lignin, cellulose, starch, minerals and vitamins {{that can be}} used as sources of carbon and energy for the growth. In this study, BLS. 11 - 01 and BLS. 11 - 02 isolates have been isolated and characterized from waste of sago hump. Locust bean gum was used as  substrate for measuring the activity of <b>mannanase.</b> Both isolates had optimum temperatures at 70 °C and 60 °C while they remain stable at temperature range of 30 °C - 90 °C. <b>Mannanase</b> from BLS. 11 - 01 and BLS. 11 - 02 had optimum pH at 6 and 7, respectively, and were also stable in wide pH range of 2 - 8. Co 2 + was a <b>mannanase</b> activator for both isolates. Cu 2 +, Zn 2 +, Ni 2 +, Ca 2 + and Fe 2 + were  <b>mannanase</b> inhibitors for two isolates. Tween 20 (0. 5 % and 1. 0 %) and NaCl (0. 5 % and 1. 0 %) were chemical reagents that could enhance the activity of BLS. 11 - 01 and BLS. 11 - 02 <b>mannanase</b> isolates.  While tween 80 (0. 5 % and 1. 0 %), urea (0. 5 % and 1. 0 %) and SDS (0. 5 % and 1. 0 %) were chemical reagents that were not effective for both isolates <b>mannanase</b> activit...|$|E

A second order polynomial equation was fitted and the optimum condition was established. The result {{showed that the}} moisture content was {{a critical factor in}} terms of its effect on <b>mannanase.</b> The optimum condition for <b>mannanase</b> production was predicted at 42. 86 % (w/v) initial moisture (31 C) temperature and 5. 5 % (w/v) inoculum size. The predicted optimal parameter were tested in the laboratory and the <b>mannanase</b> activity 45. 12 IU mL - 1 were recorded to be closed to the predicted value (44. 80 IU mL - 1). Under the optimized SSF condition (31 C, 42. 86 % moisture content (w/v) and 5. 5 % inoculum size (w/v)), the maximum <b>mannanase</b> production was to prevail about 45. 12 IU mL - 1 compare to before optimized (30 C, 50 % moisture content (w/v) and 10 % inoculum size (w/v)) was only 34. 42 IU mL - 1...|$|E

The low molecular weight enzyme was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and ion-exchange chromatography procedures. The purified β-mannanase (ManIII) {{has been identified as}} a glycoprotein (carbohydrate content 5 %) with an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa. It was active at 40 °C and pH 4. 0. It was stable for 30 min at 70 °C and has a broad pH stability (2. 0 – 12. 0). ManIII showed K m, V max, and K cat values of 17. 94 mg/ml, 93. 52 U/mg, and 28. 13 s− 1 with locust bean gum as substrate, respectively. It was inhibited by mannose with a K I of 0. 610 − 3 mg/ml. ManIII was activated by CuSO 4 and CaCl 2 (2. 5 mM). However, in presence of 2. 5 mM Co 2 +, its activity dropped to 60 % of the initial activity. Both N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences of ManIII presented no homology with <b>mannanases</b> of glycosides hydrolases.

Dodd et al. 2010, provided insight {{into the role of}} the active site residues of a GH 3 xylanase from the rumen bacterium Prevotella bryantii B 14. Particularly, their results support the hypothesis that Arg 177, Lys 214, and His 215 form a highly conserved, core set of charged amino acid residues in GH 3 enzymes, involved in the formation of linkages with the substrate. More recently, in order to get insight into the molecular basis of the substrate specificity of CpMan 5 B, a glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 5 enzyme exhibiting both β- 1, 4 -mannosidic and β- 1, 4 -glucosidic cleavage activities, Oyama et al. (2013) solved the crystal structure of the protein. The crystal structure of CpMan 5 B and the comparisons to the crystal structure of other <b>mannanases</b> (CtCel 5 C, subfamily GH 5 _ 37; TmCel 5 A, subfamily GH 5 _ 25) revealed important differences in several active site residues (Y 12, H 84, N 92, N 136, and R 196). Thirteen mutant proteins were produced, in order to evaluate the residues role in enzyme function. The R 196 A mutation eliminated all the detectable activity, indicating that this residue is essential for catalysis.|$|R
40|$|Seven {{strains of}} {{filamentous}} fungi and one yeast were isolated from flax that was dew retted in the United States. These filamentous fungi were subcultured to purity and identified, and six appear {{not to have}} been reported earlier as isolates from dew-retted flax. Five of the purified U. S. strains, two fungi isolated from flax that was dew retted in Europe, and a laboratory culture of Aspergillus sojae were tested for their ability to ret flax stems. The monocultures were evaluated for the degree of retting, fiber strength, dry weight loss, and tactile response (i. e., feel of softness) as reflected in the retted fiber. Structural modifications of representative samples of the retted flax were assessed by scanning electron microscopy. All of the filamentous fungi were able to carry out some retting, whereas the isolated yeast could not. All organisms produced pectinases when they were cultivated in shake flasks on ball-milled flax as the sole carbon source. Some fungi also produced cellulases, <b>mannanases,</b> and xylanases. Rhizomucor pusillus and Fusarium lateritium were noteworthy as retting organisms by their high level of pectinase activity, ability to attack noncellulosic cell types without attacking cellulose, capacity to penetrate the cuticular surface of the stem, and efficient fiber release from the core. The results indicated that these organisms deserve further study as potential organisms for retting of bast fibers in industrial applications...|$|R
