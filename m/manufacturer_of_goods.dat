50|$|As a catch phrase, “Buy Local” {{has become}} generic {{to the point}} of being easily manipulated. In some circles, “buy local” refers to the {{producer}} or <b>manufacturer</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b> In others, however, the term is used interchangeably with “shop local,” which refers to point-of-purchase but excludes business models that are service-oriented. In 2009, numerous national chains (also known as “big-box stores”) began advertising themselves as “buy local” options if they sold even a small amount of produce grown nearby.|$|E

50|$|In {{leaving it}} to the jury {{to decide whether the}} {{inference}} has been dispelled, regardless of the evidence against it, the negligence rule approaches the rule of strict liability. It is needlessly circuitous to make negligence the basis of recovery and impose what is in reality liability without negligence. If public policy demands that a <b>manufacturer</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> be responsible for their quality regardless of negligence there is no reason not to fix that responsibility openly. 24 Cal.2d at 463.|$|E

40|$|This case-note is {{concerned}} with a recent judgment of the ECJ, {{in which it was}} held that a jurisdiction clause, agreed in the contract concluded between the <b>manufacturer</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and the buyer thereof, cannot be relied on against a sub-buyer who brings an «action directe » for damages against the manufacturer, unless it is established that that third party has actually consented to that clause under the conditions laid down in Article 23 Regulation Brussels I. The Author, after having examined the legal basis of the «action directe» in the French legal order, critically discusses the preliminary ruling, particularly as regards the denial by the Court to refer to national law in order to assess whether the jurisdiction clause between the manufacturer and the first buyer can extend its effects vis-à-vis the subbuyer...|$|E

40|$|This action {{research}} thesis {{is about the}} predictors of sales performance within organisations, which are shifting from a <b>manufacturer</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> towards a hybrid company, supplementing their goods offerings with services, or a pure service company. The objectives of this research have been to identify the key criteria that characterise successful sales organisations or salespeople within these types of companies and what differences exist between the sales approaches and salespeople’s behaviour. This research has further aimed to explore how people in sales organisations are recruited and developed {{within the context of}} such a change initiative. The latter aim is particularly important, since this study was conducted as an {{action research}} inquiry within the context of an interim management provider, who help their clients on these topics through external support. The author has adopted pragmatism as a theoretical position to reach {{a better understanding of the}} scope of the problems. This has generated actionable knowledge relevant for sales organisations transitioning from a goods-dominant business towards a hybrid or service-dominant business. A literature review has been conducted to get a better understanding of the drivers and forces beyond servitization and sales within a business-to-business (B 2 B) context. The first research action cycle was based on the problem definition and initial literature review. Qualitative and quantitative research methods were then applied as elements of the action research process. Qualitative research was a part of cycle one and quantitative research methods were applied in cycle two. Based on the existing literature and the interviews that were conducted, the role of technical and product knowledge, as well as customer and industry knowledge was investigated. Additionally, the relevance of adapting sales approaches to varying customer demands, the role of internal collaboration as a moderating factor for sales success and the role of sales control systems, with a particular focus on reward systems, were a part of further research within cycle two. Sixteen hypotheses were developed and tested by means of an electronic survey. This survey thus identified the differences between sales organisations with an industrial background (goods-dominant) and those with a background in IT and telecommunications (hybrid or service-dominant). In regard to most of the hypotheses presented here, this study found no evidence of significant differences between Industrial and IT sales organisations. As factors that significantly influence the performance of sales organisations within hybrid and servicedominant businesses, this study has identified reward systems and, in particular, the extent to which organisations use incentive compensation as a means for motivation, as well as the extent to which salespeople are rewarded for their results. Moreover, qualitative and quantitative research provided several interesting insights for sales organisations coping with change driven by servitization. As conducted within the scope of this thesis, an action research project aims at improving a problem faced by an organisation. The assumptions made to address the underlying problem and a potential resolution did – during cycle one – not turn out as suitable, so that the initial problem could not be addressed as initially planned. Instead of personality traits, differences between Industrial and IT sales organisations were identified based on knowledge, behaviour and control. This did also address the problem and improve the situation, even if it was not initially intended in this way...|$|E
