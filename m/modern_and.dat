50|$|After Dermott's death, the two Grand Lodges {{moved slowly}} towards union. The need for unity was {{underlined}} during the Napoleonic wars, when {{the leaders of}} the Ancients, <b>Moderns,</b> <b>and</b> the Grand Lodge of Scotland acted together to prevent their lodges becoming proscribed organisations. However, the actual process of unification did not start until 1811, when the Moderns started the administrative process of returning their ritual to a form acceptable to the other British Grand Lodges. The final union was in the hands of two sons of the King, the Duke of Sussex, the Grand Master of the <b>Moderns,</b> <b>and</b> the Duke of Kent. Kent had already effected a union in Canada by simply abolishing the <b>Moderns,</b> <b>and</b> merging their lodges with those of the Ancients. The new Grand Lodge, the United Grand Lodge of England, retained the infrastructure of the <b>Moderns,</b> <b>and</b> the ritual of the Ancients.|$|R
