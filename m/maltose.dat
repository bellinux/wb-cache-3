5|$|<b>Maltose</b> {{is formed}} during the {{germination}} of certain grains, {{the most notable}} being barley, which is converted into malt, {{the source of the}} sugar's name. A molecule of <b>maltose</b> is formed by the combination of two molecules of glucose. It is less sweet than glucose, fructose or sucrose. It is formed in the body during the digestion of starch by the enzyme amylase and is itself broken down during digestion by the enzyme maltase.|$|E
5|$|It is {{considered}} that overeating {{and lack of}} muscle tone is {{the main cause of}} a beer belly, rather than beer consumption. A 2004 study, however, found a link between binge drinking and a beer belly. But with most overconsumption, it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself. Several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high glycemic index of 110, the same as maltose; however, the <b>maltose</b> in beer undergoes metabolism by yeast during fermentation so that beer consists mostly of water, hop oils and only trace amounts of sugars, including <b>maltose.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lactose, <b>maltose,</b> and sucrose are all {{compound}} sugars, disaccharides, {{with the}} general formula C12H22O11. They are formed by the combination of two monosaccharide molecules with the exclusion of a molecule of water.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} function of enzymes {{is in the}} digestive systems of animals. Enzymes such as amylases and proteases break down large molecules (starch or proteins, respectively) into smaller ones, {{so they can be}} absorbed by the intestines. Starch molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as <b>maltose</b> and eventually glucose, which can then be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food substances. In ruminants, which have herbivorous diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, cellulase, to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.|$|E
25|$|Bacteriophage Lambda binds to an E. coli cell {{by means}} of its J protein in the tail tip. The J protein interacts with the <b>maltose</b> outer {{membrane}} porin (the product of the lamB gene) of E. coli, a porin molecule, {{which is part of}} the <b>maltose</b> operon.|$|E
25|$|The {{salivary glands}} in mammals are exocrine glands, glands with ducts, that produce saliva, which is {{composed}} of several components including amylase, a digestive enzyme that breaks down starch into <b>maltose</b> and glucose. In humans and some other mammals the secretion is alpha-amylase, also known as ptyalin.|$|E
25|$|A {{mixture of}} sugars and other carbohydrates, honey is mainly {{fructose}} (about 38%) and glucose (about 32%), with remaining sugars including <b>maltose,</b> sucrose, and other complex carbohydrates. Its glycemic index ranges from 31 to 78, {{depending on the}} variety. The specific composition, color, aroma, and flavor of any batch of honey depend on the flowers foraged by bees that produced the honey.|$|E
25|$|The average {{ratio was}} 56% {{fructose}} to 44% glucose, but the ratios {{in the individual}} honeys ranged {{from a high of}} 64% fructose and 36% glucose (one type of flower honey; table 3 in reference) to a low of 50% fructose and 50% glucose (a different floral source). This NMR method was not able to quantify <b>maltose,</b> galactose, and the other minor sugars as compared to fructose and glucose.|$|E
25|$|All {{strains of}} S.cerevisiae can grow aerobically on glucose, <b>maltose,</b> and {{trehalose}} {{and fail to}} grow on lactose and cellobiose. However, growth on other sugars is variable. Galactose and fructose are shown to be {{two of the best}} fermenting sugars. The ability of yeasts to use different sugars can differ depending on whether they are grown aerobically or anaerobically. Some strains cannot grow anaerobically on sucrose and trehalose.|$|E
25|$|Lactose, a {{disaccharide}} {{composed of}} one D-galactose molecule and one D-glucose molecule, occurs naturally in mammalian milk. The systematic name for lactose is O-β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-glucopyranose. Other notable disaccharides include <b>maltose</b> (two D-glucoses linked α-1,4) and cellulobiose (two D-glucoses linked β-1,4). Disaccharides {{can be classified}} into two types: reducing and non-reducing disaccharides. If the functional group is present in bonding with another sugar unit, it is called a reducing disaccharide or biose.|$|E
25|$|Protein {{purification}} tags: Some {{expression vectors}} include proteins or peptide sequences {{that allows for}} easier purification of the expressed protein. Examples include polyhistidine-tag, glutathione-S-transferase, and <b>maltose</b> binding protein. Some of these tags may also allow for increased solubility of the target protein. The target protein is fused to the protein tag, but a protease cleavage site positioned in the polypeptide linker region between the protein and the tag allows the tag to be removed later.|$|E
25|$|The Saccharomyces (sugar mold) yeast genus {{is favored}} for {{winemaking}} (for both grapes {{as well as}} other fruit wines in addition also to being used in brewing and breadmaking) because of the generally reliable and positive attributes it can bring to the wine. These yeasts will usually readily ferment glucose, sucrose and raffinose and metabolize glucose, sucrose, raffinose, <b>maltose</b> and ethanol. However, Saccharomyces cannot ferment or utilize pentoses (such as arabinose) which is usually present in small amount in wines as residual sugars.|$|E
25|$|Added {{sugar is}} not always evident in food products. While {{expected}} in desserts, candies, and soft drinks, sugar is also added {{to a wide range}} of non-sweet items such as bread, crackers, potato chips, peanut butter, soup, salad dressing, ketchup, mayonnaise, and many other common sauces. Forms of added sugar include technically accurate, but misleading, terms such as cane juice, evaporated cane juice, corn syrup and corn syrup solids, malt syrup, rice syrup, dextrose, <b>maltose,</b> maltodextrin, molasses, treacle, and xylose.|$|E
25|$|However, TEV {{protease}} {{does have}} limitations as a biochemical tool. It {{is prone to}} deactivation by self-cleavage (autolysis), though this can be abolished through a single S219V mutation in the internal cleavage site. The protease expressed alone is also poorly soluble, however several {{attempts have been made}} to improve its solubility through directed evolution and computational design. It has also been shown that expression can be improved by fusion to <b>maltose</b> binding protein (MBP) which acts a solubility enhancing partner.|$|E
25|$|Some values, such {{as those}} for <b>maltose</b> and glucose, vary little. Others, such as {{aspartame}} and sodium saccharin, have much larger variation. Regardless of variation, the perceived intensity of substances relative to each reference substance remains consistent for taste ranking purposes. The indices table for McLaughlin & Margolskee (1994) for example, {{is essentially the same}} as that of Svrivastava & Rastogi (2003), Guyton & Hall (2006), and Joesten et al. (2007). The rankings are all the same, with any differences, where they exist, being in the values assigned from the studies from which they derive.|$|E
25|$|Fattened ducks are slaughtered, plucked, {{eviscerated}} {{and rinsed}} thoroughly with water. Air is pumped {{under the skin}} through the neck cavity to separate the skin from the fat. The duck is then soaked in boiling water {{for a short while}} before it is hung up to dry. While it is hung, the duck is glazed with a layer of <b>maltose</b> syrup, and the inside is rinsed once more with water. Having been left to stand for 24 hours, the duck is roasted in an oven until it turns shiny brown.|$|E
25|$|Mannitol is {{commonly}} produced via the hydrogenation of fructose, which is formed from either starch or sucrose (common table sugar). Although starch is a cheaper source than sucrose, {{the transformation of}} starch is much more complicated. Eventually, it yields a syrup containing about 42% fructose, 52% glucose, and 6% <b>maltose.</b> Sucrose is simply hydrolyzed into an invert sugar syrup, which contains about 50% fructose. In both cases, the syrups are chromatographically purified to contain 90–95% fructose. The fructose is then hydrogenated over a nickel catalyst into a mixture of isomers sorbitol and mannitol. Yield is typically 50%:50%, although slightly alkaline reaction conditions can slightly increase mannitol yields.|$|E
25|$|The {{digestive}} {{functions of}} saliva include moistening food {{and helping to}} create a food bolus. This lubricative function of saliva allows the food bolus to be passed easily from the mouth into the esophagus. Saliva contains the enzyme amylase, also called ptyalin, which is capable of breaking down starch into simpler sugars such as <b>maltose</b> and dextrin that can be further broken down in the small intestine. Only about 30% starch digestion {{takes place in the}} mouth cavity. Salivary glands also secrete salivary lipase (a more potent form of lipase) to begin fat digestion. Salivary lipase plays a large role in fat digestion in newborn infants as their pancreatic lipase still needs some time to develop.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} {{has been involved}} in many scientific breakthroughs and inventions. From 1925 until 1948, Sir Norman Haworth was Professor and Director of the Department of Chemistry. He was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Science and acted as Vice-Principal from 1947 until 1948. His research focused predominantly on carbohydrate chemistry in which he confirmed a number of structures of optically active sugars. By 1928, he had deduced and confirmed the structures of <b>maltose,</b> cellobiose, lactose, gentiobiose, melibiose, gentianose, raffinose, as well as the glucoside ring tautomeric structure of aldose sugars. His research helped to define the basic features of the starch, cellulose, glycogen, inulin and xylan molecules. He also contributed towards solving the problems with bacterial polysaccharides. He was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1937.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, Kluyver and van Niel {{coined the}} genus Sporobolomyces and {{classified}} {{it under the}} Basidiomycota. They recognized that the yeast phase produced by Sporobolomyces exhibited the same forcible discharge mechanism as the basidiospores of the Basidiomycota. They therefore hypothesized that the asexual ballistoconidia of Sporobolomyces are homologues with the basidiospores of the Basidiomycota. Their hypothesis however was questioned by many who did not consider the asexual nature of the ballistoconidia as a basidiomycetous trait. Its classification as a basidiomycetous yeast was further demonstrated by Nyland (1949) {{with the discovery of}} its teleomorph; the genus Sporidiobolus. The teleomorph presented basidiomycetous traits such as the presence of dikaryotic hyphae with clamp connections and the formation of resting spores known as teliospores. In the past, Sporidiobolus salmonicolor was thought to be conspecific with Sporidiobolus johnsonii; however it is now well established that they are distinct taxa. Sporidiobolus salmonicolor is distinguished from S.johnsonii by the absence in the former of assimilation of <b>maltose,</b> methyl-a-D-glucoside, cellobiose or salicin.|$|E
25|$|Cellulose {{production}} depends {{heavily on}} several {{factors such as}} the growth medium, environmental conditions, and the formation of byproducts. The fermentation medium contains carbon, nitrogen, and other macro and micro nutrients required for bacteria growth. Bacteria are most efficient when supplied with an abundant carbon source and minimal nitrogen source. Glucose and sucrose are the most commonly used carbon sources for cellulose production, while fructose, <b>maltose,</b> xylose, starch, and glycerol have been tried. Sometimes, ethanol may be used to increase cellulose production. The problem with using glucose is that gluconic acid is formed as a byproduct which decreases the pH of the culture and in turn, decreases the production of cellulose. Studies have shown that gluconic acid production can be decreased in the presence of lignosulfonate. Addition of organic acids, specifically acetic acid, also helped in a higher yield of cellulose. Studies of using molasses medium in a jar fermentor as well as added components of sugarcane molasses on certain strains of bacteria have been studied with results showing increases in cellulose production.|$|E
25|$|Dimer {{formation}} of the two ABC domains of transporters requires ATP binding. It is generally observed that the ATP bound state {{is associated with the}} most extensive interface between ABC domains, whereas the structures of nucleotide-free transporters exhibit conformations with greater separations between the ABC domains. Structures of the ATP-bound state of isolated NBDs have been reported for importers including HisP, GlcV, MJ1267, E. coli MalK (E.c.MalK), T. litoralis MalK (TlMalK), and exporters such as TAP, HlyB, MJ0796, Sav1866, and MsbA. In these transporters, ATP is bound to the ABC domain. Two molecules of ATP are positioned at the interface of the dimer, sandwiched between the Walker A motif of one subunit and the LSGGQ motif of the other. This was first observed in Rad50 and reported in structures of MJ0796, the NBD subunit of the LolD transporter from Methanococcus jannaschii and E.c.MalK of a <b>maltose</b> transporter. These structures were also consistent with results from biochemical studies revealing that ATP is in close contact with residues in the P-loop and LSGGQ motif during catalysis.|$|E
25|$|Structures of the ModBC-A and MalFGK2-E, {{which are}} in complex with their binding protein, {{correspond}} to small ABC importers. The TMDs of ModBC-A and MalFGK2-E have only six helices per subunit. The homodimer of ModBC-A is in a conformation in which the TM subunits (ModB) orient in an inverted V-shape with a cavity accessible to the cytoplasm. The ABC subunits (ModC), on the other hand, are arranged in an open, nucleotide-free conformation, in which the P-loop of one subunit faces but is detached from the LSGGQ motif of the other. The binding protein ModA is in a closed conformation with substrate bound in a cleft between its two lobes and attached to the extracellular loops of ModB, wherein the substrate is sitting directly above the closed entrance of the transporter. The MalFGK2-E structure resembles the catalytic transition state for ATP hydrolysis. It is in a closed conformation where it contains two ATP molecules, sandwiched between the Walker A and B motifs of one subunit and the LSGGQ motif of the other subunit. The <b>maltose</b> binding protein (MBP or MalE) is docked on the periplasmic side of the TM subunits (MalF and MalG) and a large, occluded cavity {{can be found at}} the interface of MalF and MalG. The arrangement of the TM helices is in a conformation that is closed toward the cytoplasm but with an opening that faces outward. The structure suggests a possibility that MBP may stimulate the ATPase activity of the transporter upon binding.|$|E
500|$|Sugar is {{the generic}} name for sweet, soluble carbohydrates, {{many of which}} are used in food. There are various types of sugar derived from {{different}} sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The [...] "table sugar" [...] or [...] "granulated sugar" [...] most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide of glucose and fructose. Sugar is used in prepared foods (e.g., cookies and cakes) and it is added to some foods and beverages (e.g., coffee and tea). In the body, sucrose is hydrolysed into the simple sugars fructose and glucose. Other disaccharides include <b>maltose</b> from malted grain, and lactose from milk. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides or polysaccharides. Some other chemical substances, such as glycerol [...] may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Diet food substitutes for sugar, include aspartame and sucralose, a chlorinated derivative of sucrose.|$|E
2500|$|Another form of amylase, β-amylase (...) (alternative names: 1,4-α-D-glucan maltohydrolase; glycogenase; saccharogen amylase) is also {{synthesized}} by bacteria, fungi, and plants. [...] Working {{from the}} non-reducing end, β-amylase catalyzes the hydrolysis {{of the second}} α-1,4 glycosidic bond, cleaving off two glucose units (<b>maltose)</b> at a time. [...] During the ripening of fruit, β-amylase breaks starch into <b>maltose,</b> resulting in the sweet flavor of ripe fruit.|$|E
2500|$|The α-amylases (...) (CAS# 9014-71-5) (alternative names: 1,4-α-D-glucan glucanohydrolase; glycogenase) are calcium metalloenzymes. [...] By acting {{at random}} {{locations}} along the starch chain, α-amylase breaks down long-chain carbohydrates, ultimately yielding maltotriose and <b>maltose</b> from amylose, or <b>maltose,</b> glucose and [...] "limit dextrin" [...] from amylopectin. [...] Because it can act {{anywhere on the}} substrate, α-amylase tends to be faster-acting than β-amylase. [...] In animals, {{it is a major}} digestive enzyme, and its optimum pH is 6.7–7.0.|$|E
2500|$|Recently, three {{different}} PET contrast agents {{have been developed}} to image bacterial infections in vivo: <b>maltose,</b> maltohexaose [...] and 2-fluorodeoxysorbitol (FDS). FDS has also the added benefit of being able to target only Enterobacteriaceae.|$|E
2500|$|In humans, dietary {{starches}} {{are composed}} of glucose units arranged in long chains called amylose, a polysaccharide. During digestion, bonds between glucose molecules are broken by salivary and pancreatic amylase, resulting in progressively smaller chains of glucose. [...] This results in simple sugars glucose and <b>maltose</b> (2 glucose molecules) that can be absorbed by the small intestine.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "malt" [...] {{refers to}} several {{products}} of the process: the grains to which this process has been applied, for example malted barley; the sugar, heavy in <b>maltose,</b> derived from such grains, such as the baker's malt used in various cereals; or a product based on malted milk, similar to a malted milkshake (i.e., [...] "malts").|$|E
2500|$|In vitro, optimal {{proliferation}} {{temperature is}} reported around 40°C in neutral or slightly acidic environments (pH [...] 6.8–7.0). The majority of strains {{are capable of}} fermentation of sugars without gas formation (most importantly, glucose and galactose; older cultures are reported to also metabolize <b>maltose</b> and starch). Bacteria produce both exo- and [...] endotoxins. [...] The role of the toxins identified {{in the process of}} melioidosis symptom development has not been fully elucidated.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the next}} step, brewers use {{a process called}} mashing to extract the sugars. Brewers warm cracked malt in temperature-modulated water, {{activating}} the enzymes, which cleave more of the malt's remaining starch into various sugars, {{the largest percentage of}} which is <b>maltose.</b> Modern beer mashing practices typically include high enough temperatures at mash-out to deactivate remaining enzymes, thus it is no longer [...] The liquid produced from this, wort, is then concentrated by using heat or a vacuum procedure to evaporate water from the mixture. The concentrated wort is called malt extract.|$|E
2500|$|Halostagnicola larsenii is a halophilic, neutrophilic, chemo-organotroph {{and uses}} oxygen as its {{terminal}} electron acceptor. H. larsenii can utilize {{a variety of}} carbohydrates such as fructose, glycerol, lactose, glucose, arabinose, acetate, ribose, starch, <b>maltose,</b> galactose, ribose, xylose, glutamate, and propionate as substrates for growth. Growth substrates were determined {{through the use of}} the isolation medium, which contained the substrate being tested along with yeast extract. [...] Additionally, H. larsenii undergoes assimilatory nitrate reduction to nitrite to ammonia. This process differs from nitrate reduction because it occurs aerobically and uses ferrodoxin as an electron donor.|$|E
2500|$|In {{parallel}} with the enormous shift (in industrialized nations) away from breastfeeding to home-made formulas, nutrition scientists continued to analyze human milk and attempted to make infant formulas that more closely matched its composition. [...] <b>Maltose</b> and dextrins were believed nutritionally important, and in 1912, the Mead Johnson Company released a milk additive called Dextri-Maltose. This formula was made available to mothers only by physicians. In 1919, milkfats were replaced with a blend of animal and vegetable fats {{as part of the}} continued drive to closer simulate human milk. This formula was called SMA for [...] "simulated milk adapted." ...|$|E
2500|$|The optimum {{temperature}} for growth of Sporobolomyces salmonicolor is between , being the highest tolerable temperature. Growth {{does not occur}} at [...] This species does not undergo fermentation. Additionally, Sporobolomyces salmonicolor shows positive urease activity and a positive staining response when stained with diazonium blue B. Diazonium blue B is a technique used to classify asexual yeasts {{as members of the}} Zygomycota, Basidiomycota or Ascomycota. The major ubiquinone present is Q-10. The cell wall of S.salmonicolor contains fucose, mannose, glucose and galactose, however xylose is absent. Colonies grow in the presence of glucose, sucrose, <b>maltose,</b> cellobiose, ,-trehalose, melezitose, D-arabinose, ethanol, glycerol, D-mannitol, D-glucitol, D-gluconate, succinate, nitrate and urease. This species does not assimilate myo-inositol or D-glucuronate, and do not form extracellular starch-like compounds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{extraction}} {{is done in}} a large kettle (usually made {{of stainless}} steel) called a mash tun. At first, the hot water dissolves the sugars (<b>maltose)</b> and enzymes (diastase) in the grist. Then the enzymes act on the starch {{left over from the}} malting stage, continuing the conversion to sugar, and producing a sugary liquid called wort. Typically, each batch of grist is mashed three times or so to extract all the fermentable sugars. [...] The first water is injected at approximately 60°C, the second portion at approximately 72°C and the third and final portion at approximately 88°C. [...] The wort from the first two water courses is drained into [...] "washback" [...] vessels for further processing, whereas the third course is retained as the first charge in the next batch.|$|E
2500|$|Malt is {{germinate}}d cereal grains {{that have been}} dried in {{a process known as}} [...] "malting". The grains are made to germinate by soaking in water, and are then halted from germinating further by drying with hot air. Malting grains develops the enzymes required for modifying the grain's starches into various types of sugar, including the monosaccharide glucose, the disaccharide <b>maltose,</b> the trisaccharide maltotriose, and higher sugars called maltodextrines. It also develops other enzymes, such as proteases, which break down the proteins in the grain into forms that can be used by yeast. Depending on when the malting process is stopped one gets a preferred starch enzyme ratio and partly converted starch into fermentable sugars. Malt also contains small amounts of other sugars, such as sucrose and fructose, which are not products of starch modification but were already in the grain. Further conversion to fermentable sugars is achieved during the mashing process.|$|E
