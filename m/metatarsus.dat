5|$|The low foot {{to lower}} leg ratio in Deinonychus is due partly to an unusually short <b>metatarsus</b> (upper foot bones). The ratio is {{actually}} larger in smaller individuals than in larger ones. Ostrom {{suggested that the}} short <b>metatarsus</b> {{may be related to}} the function of the sickle claw, and used the fact that it appears to get shorter as individuals aged as support for this. He interpreted all these features– the short second toe with enlarged claw, short <b>metatarsus,</b> etc.– as support for the use of the hind leg as an offensive weapon, where the sickle claw would strike downwards and backwards, and the leg pulled back and down at the same time, slashing and tearing at the prey. Ostrom suggested that the short <b>metatarsus</b> reduced overall stress on the leg bones during such an attack, and interpreted the unusual arrangement of muscle attachments in the Deinonychus leg as support for his idea that a different set of muscles was used in the predatory stroke than in walking or running. Therefore, Ostrom concluded that the legs of Deinonychus represented a balance between running adaptations needed for an agile predator, and stress-reducing features to compensate for its unique foot weapon.|$|E
5|$|Palaeontologists of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich {{studied the}} specimen, which {{revealed}} previously unknown {{features of the}} plumage, such as feathers on both {{the upper and lower}} legs and <b>metatarsus,</b> and the only preserved tail tip.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales of}} birds are {{composed}} of the same keratin as beaks, claws, and spurs. They are found mainly on the toes and <b>metatarsus,</b> but may be found further up on the ankle in some birds. Most bird scales do not overlap significantly, except {{in the cases of}} kingfishers and woodpeckers.|$|E
5|$|Plateosaurus shows {{a number}} of cursorial adaptations, {{including}} an erect hind limb posture, a relatively long lower leg, an elongated <b>metatarsus</b> and a digitigrade foot posture. However, in contrast to mammalian cursors, the moment arms of the limb extending muscles are short, especially in the ankle, where a distinct, moment arm-increasing tuber on the calcaneum is missing. This means that in contrast to running mammals, Plateosaurus probably did not use gaits with aerial, unsupported phases. Instead, Plateosaurus must have increased speed by using higher stride frequencies, created by rapid and powerful limb retraction. Reliance on limb retraction instead of extension is typical for non-avian dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The {{legs are}} reddish brown, or {{sometimes}} yellowish, with the femora of the anterior (first) pair being darker and enlarged, {{especially in the}} male. The anterior legs have three pairs of long spines on the ventral surface of the tibia and two pairs of spines on the <b>metatarsus.</b> The Peckhams give the following measurements for the lengths of the legs of a male specimen, starting with the anterior pair: 3.7mm, 2.2mm, 2mm, 3mm. In females, the fourth pair of legs are the longest. The pedipalp in the male has a single tibial apophysis which tapers gradually.|$|E
5|$|Coelurus {{is known}} {{from most of}} the {{skeleton}} of a single individual, including numerous vertebrae, partial pelvic and shoulder girdles, and much of the arms and legs, stored at the Peabody Museum of Natural History; however, the relative completeness of the skeleton was not known until 1980. The fossils were recovered from Reed's Quarry 13 at Como Bluff, Wyoming. Additionally, two arm bones possibly belonging to this genus are known from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Utah. It was not a large dinosaur. Its weight has been estimated at around , with a length of about 2.4meters (7.9ft) and a hip height of 0.7meters (2.3ft). From reconstructions of the skeleton, Coelurus had a relatively long neck and torso due to its long vertebrae, a long slender hindlimb due to its long <b>metatarsus,</b> and potentially a small slender skull.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Ostrom {{published}} another monograph on {{the shoulder}} of Deinonychus in which he realized that the pubis that he had described was actually a coracoid– a shoulder element. In that same year, another specimen of Deinonychus, MCZ 4371, was discovered and excavated in Montana by Steven Orzack during a Harvard University expedition headed by Farish Jenkins. This discovery added several new elements: well preserved femurs, pubes, a sacrum, and better ilia, as well as elements of the pes and <b>metatarsus.</b> Ostrom described this specimen and revised his skeletal restoration of Deinonychus. This time it showed the very long pubis, and Ostrom began to suspect that they may have even been a little retroverted like those of birds.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{a review}} of all well-preserved {{specimens}} including the then-newly discovered Thermopolis specimen concluded that two distinct species of Archaeopteryx could be supported: A. lithographica (consisting of at least the London and Solnhofen specimens), and A. siemensii (consisting of at least the Berlin, Munich, and Thermopolis specimens). The two species are distinguished primarily by large flexor tubercles on the foot claws in A. lithographica (the claws of A. siemensii specimens being relatively simple and straight). A. lithographica also had a constricted portion of the crown in some teeth and a stouter <b>metatarsus.</b> A supposed additional species, Wellnhoferia grandis (based on the Solnhofen specimen), seems to be indistinguishable from A. lithographica except in its larger size.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys gorgasi is a {{medium-sized}} oryzomyine with small ears and large feet, and {{is similar to}} the marsh rice rat in general appearance. The long and coarse fur is brownish above and ochraceous below. At the base of the tail, the upper and lower sides differ in color and at the end is a short tuft of hairs. The scales on the tail are well-developed. As in other Oryzomys, the hindfeet exhibit specializations for life in the water. The plantar (lower) surface of the <b>metatarsus</b> is naked. Two of the pads are very small. Ungual tufts, tufts of hair at the bases of the claws, are poorly developed. Interdigital webbing is present, but extends along {{less than half of the}} first phalanges.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} {{skeleton}} in Museo di Storia Naturale di Firenze, which it obtained from France in 1833, but was mislabelled as a cassowary until correctly identified by Italian zoologist Enrico Hillyer Giglioli in 1900. Several elements of this skeleton are missing, and some have been replaced with wooden copies. Its right <b>metatarsus</b> was damaged during life and had healed incorrectly. It {{was thought to be}} a male, but is now known to be a composite of two individuals. A fourth specimen was thought to be kept in the Liverpool Museum, but it may simply be a juvenile mainland emu. Apart from the King Island emu specimens brought to France, a few are also known to have been brought to mainland Australia in 1803, but their fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Accrington Stanley {{accepted}} an undisclosed bid from Wrexham in July 2005, {{which included a}} sell-on clause and a bonus if he returned to play international football. He scored on his debut in a friendly against UEFA Champions League winners Liverpool in the 4–3 defeat after he came on as a substitute. McEvilly suffered a stress fracture in a <b>metatarsus</b> bone on his right foot in the 1–1 home draw with Notts County on 11 December, although he declared himself fit to play their following game against Carlisle United, he was substituted after 45 minutes after receiving a mouth injury which had required temporary dental surgery the same evening. His foot injury was later operated on and he received further dental treatment. His return to the Wrexham team following his injury was on 9 April 2006, in their 2–1 home defeat to Shrewsbury Town when he came on as a substitute replacing Matt Crowell in the 45th minute. He made a further three appearances scoring one goal, before breaking the same bone again in mid-April sidelining him {{until the end of}} the season. During the 2005–06 season, McEvilly made a total of 23 appearances for Wrexham, scoring seven goals in League Two.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the eight}} legs of a spider {{consists}} of seven distinct parts. The part closest to and attaching the leg to the cephalothorax is the coxa; the next segment is the short trochanter that works as a hinge for the following long segment, the femur; next is the spider's knee, the patella, which acts as the hinge for the tibia; the <b>metatarsus</b> is next, and it connects the tibia to the tarsus (which may {{be thought of as}} a foot of sorts); the tarsus ends in a claw made up of either two or three points, depending on the family to which the spider belongs. Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, spiders and a few other groups still use hydraulic pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. The only extensor muscles in spider legs are located in the three hip joints (bordering the coxa and the trochanter). As a result, a spider with a punctured cephalothorax cannot extend its legs, and the legs of dead spiders curl up. Spiders can generate pressures up to eight times their resting level to extend their legs, and jumping spiders can jump up to 50 times their own length by suddenly increasing the blood pressure in the third or fourth pair of legs. Although larger spiders use hydraulics to straighten their legs, unlike smaller jumping spiders they depend on their flexor muscles to generate the propulsive force for their jumps.|$|E
5|$|The scapula (shoulder blade) {{was longer}} than the humerus (upper arm bone); its blade was slender and narrow, and {{slightly}} twisted, following the contour of the ribs. The scapula did not expand at the upper end but was very expanded at the base. The coracoid was mainly thin and plate-like. The humerus had a slender shaft, was slightly twisted along its length, and was slightly bowed. The deltopectoral crest (where the deltoid and pectoral muscles attach) was weakly developed. The ends of the ulna were expanded, and ridges extended along the shaft. The radius was more robust than the ulna, which is unusual. When seen from above, the pelvic girdle was very broad for a bipedal archosaur, and became wider towards the hind part. The broadness of the pelvic region may have accommodated a rear extension of the gut. The ilium was elongated and the ischium was long and slender. Though the pubis is not known, it was probably reduced in size like that of Homalocephale. The femur (thigh bone) was slender and inwards curved, the tibia was slender and twisted, and the fibula was slender and wide at the upper end. The <b>metatarsus</b> of the foot {{appears to have been}} narrow, and the single known ungual (claw bone) of a toe was slender and slightly curved. Though the limbs of Stegoceras are not completely known, other pachycephalosaurs show that they had five-fingered hands and four toes.|$|E
25|$|Scutella – scales {{that are}} not quite as large as scutes, such as those found on the caudal, or hind part, of the chicken <b>metatarsus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Eusauporoda {{are also}} {{hypothesized}} {{to have a}} semi-digitigrade foot posturem demonstrated by footprint evidence. Paleontologist Jeffrey Wilson explains that eusauropods differ from theropods and prosauropods that have digitigrade pes where their heel and metatarsals are lifted off of the ground. Eusauropods show asymmetry in their metatarsal shaft diameters where metatarsal I is broader than the others, suggesting that their weight was mostly assumed by their inner feet. According to Steven Salisbury and Jay Nair, basal eusauropods retain four pedal unguals but reduce their phalangeal number in their fourth digit to three units. The <b>metatarsus</b> in eusauropods {{is less than a}} quarter of their tibial length, unlike sauropod outgroups that have long hindlimbs and <b>metatarsus</b> that are almost half of their tibial length.|$|E
25|$|In {{the pelvis}} {{there was a}} little notch in the front edge of the ilium. The {{relatively}} long shaft of the ischium curved downwards. The hindlimb was elongated, largely because of a long lower leg, having 90% of the length of the thighbone. The foot was also long, especially in the <b>metatarsus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The walking legs again {{follow the}} typical {{arachnid}} plan with a coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, <b>metatarsus</b> and tarsus. The coxae surround a single sternum. In well preserved palaeocharinids {{there is a}} ring, or annulus, around the trochanter–femur joint {{which may be the}} remains of an earlier leg segment. The legs are largely unmodified, although in Anthracosironidae the forelegs are quite large and spiny, presumably to help catch prey. The legs end in three claws, two large ones and a smaller median claw.|$|E
25|$|The pedipalps {{have only}} six segments: the <b>metatarsus</b> is missing. In adult males, the tarsus of each palp is {{modified}} to carry an elaborate and often species-specific structure used for mating (variously called a palpal bulb, palpal organ or copulatory bulb). The basal segments of the pedipalps, the coxae, next to the mouth, are modified to assist with feeding, and are termed maxillae, although they are not homologous with the maxillae of mandibulate arthropods. In mesothele and mygalomorph spiders, the maxillae are only slightly modified; in araneomorph spiders, the anterior edge is often saw-like and is used in cutting up prey.|$|E
25|$|Spiders {{typically}} have eight walking legs (insects have six). They {{do not have}} antennae; the pair of appendages {{in front of the}} legs are the pedipalps (or just palps). Spiders' legs are made up of seven segments. Starting from the body end, these are the coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, <b>metatarsus</b> and tarsus. The tip of the tarsus bears claws, which vary in number and size. Spiders that spin webs {{typically have}} three claws, the middle one being small; hunting spiders typically have only two claws. Since they do not have antennae, spiders use specialised and sensitive setae on their legs to pick up scent, sounds, vibrations and air currents.|$|E
25|$|In the {{oesophagus}} tract {{about eight}} scales and some bone fragments are present. Dal Sasso & Maganuco considered {{it likely that}} these had not been swallowed as loose elements but were {{the remains of a}} meal, partly regurgitated from the stomach in the final death throes. In the stomach position itself, a cluster of small bones is visible. These include an ankle with a three millimetre wide <b>metatarsus</b> consisting of five metatarsals attached, a tail vertebra and the upper end of an ulna. If the remains represent a single prey animal, it is likely either a member of the Mesoeucrocodylia or some lepidosaurian lizard-like animal; the size indicates the last possibility. In the descending tract of the duodenum two clusters of lizard scales are present and, more below, a fish vertebra. The jejunum shows a cluster of dozens of fish vertebrae, likely having belonged to a member of the Clupeomorpha. A second cluster of vertebrae was found at the jejunum-ileum boundary. The final tract of the rectum still holds faeces in which a piece of skin is visible showing seventeen scales of a fish of the Osteoglossiformes that was nine seasons old, judging from the growth lines on the scales.|$|E
500|$|Specialized types: cancella; scutella; scutes; [...] Also defined herewith: reticulae; acrometatarsium/acrotarsium. The {{scales of}} birds are {{composed}} of keratin like their beaks and claws, and are found mainly on the toes and <b>metatarsus,</b> though they may appear further up on the ankle. They do not overlap significantly, except {{in the cases of}} kingfishers and woodpeckers. The scales and scutes of birds were originally thought to be homologous to those of reptiles and mammals; Later research, however, suggests that scales in birds re-evolved after the evolution of feathers. Bird embryos begin development with smooth skin. On the feet, the corneum, or outermost layer of this skin may keratinize, thicken and form scales. Bird scales can be organized into:i) cancella—minute scales which are really just a thickening and hardening of the skin, crisscrossed with shallow grooves;ii) scutella—scales that are not quite as large as scutes, such as those found on the caudal, or hind part, of the chicken metatarsus; and iii) scutes—the largest scales, usually on the anterior surface of the <b>metatarsus</b> and dorsal surface of the toes. The rows of scutes on the anterior of the <b>metatarsus</b> is sometimes termed an [...] "acrometatarsium" [...] or [...] "acrotarsium".Reticulae, by contrast, are small, keeled scale-like structures covering the bottoms of bird feet, but are not true scales. Evolutionary developmental studies on reticulae found that they are composed entirely of alpha-keratin (whereas, true epidermal scales {{are composed of}} a mix of alpha and beta keratin). This, along with their unique structure, has led to the suggestion that reticulae are actually feather buds that were arrested early in development.|$|E
500|$|Also, hind toe; first digit. Specialized types: {{incumbent}} and elevated. A bird's usually {{rear facing}} toe; its hind toe. When it is attached {{near the base}} of the [...] it is termed incumbent, and when projecting from a higher portion of the <b>metatarsus</b> (as in rails) it is termed elevated. The hallux is a bird's first digit, in many birds being the sole rear facing toe (including in most [...] species that have [...] feet) and is homologous to the human big toe.|$|E
500|$|The three best-known small theropods of the Morrison Formation [...] Coelurus, Ornitholestes, and Tanycolagreus [...] were {{generalized}} coelurosaurs, {{and they}} have been mistaken for each other at various times. Now that Coelurus and Ornitholestes have been more fully described, it is possible to distinguish them by various characteristics of their anatomy. For example, they had visibly different proportions: Coelurus had a longer back and neck than Ornitholestes, and longer, more slender legs and feet. Coelurus and Tanycolagreus are more similar, but differ in a variety of details. Such details include the shape of the upper arm, forearm, and thigh bones; the location of muscle attachments on the thigh bone, proportionally longer back vertebrae; and, again, the very long <b>metatarsus</b> of Coelurus.|$|E
500|$|The broad-billed parrot {{possessed a}} {{distinct}} frontal crest of feathers. Ridges on the skull {{indicate that this}} crest was firmly attached, and that the bird, unlike cockatoos, could not raise or lower it. The 1601 Gelderland sketch was examined in 2003 by Hume, who compared the ink finish with the underlying pencil sketch {{and found that the}} latter showed several additional details. The pencil sketch depicts the crest as a tuft of rounded feathers attached {{to the front of the}} head at the base of the beak, and shows long primary covert feathers, large secondary feathers, and a slightly bifurcated tail. Measurements of sub-fossils known by 1893 show that the mandible was [...] in length, [...] in width, the femur was [...] in length, the tibia was , and the <b>metatarsus</b> [...] Unlike other Mascarene parrots, the broad-billed parrot had a flattened skull.|$|E
500|$|Vulcanodons limbs were {{sturdy and}} column-like, and its forelimbs were already {{proportionally}} long, reaching 76% of hindlimb length. Its lower leg, <b>metatarsus,</b> and toes were shortened {{in comparison to}} its bipedal ancestors, but still not as short as in later sauropods. The sacrum was made out of four fused sacral vertebrae; [...] "prosauropods" [...] possessed only three sacrals. The tail vertebra bodies already showed an incipient excavation of their lateral sides, saving weight and giving them a waisted appearance when viewed from below. In later sauropods, this excavations were enlarged to form extensive perforated pockets called pleurocoels. Contrasting the many sauropod-like features of the skeleton, the pelvis was relatively primitive, reminiscent of its [...] "prosauropod" [...] ancestors. One such feature is that the brevis shelf of the ilium has a fossa, which is not found in any more derived sauropods.|$|E
500|$|Plateosaurus had {{the typical}} body {{shape of a}} herbivorous bipedal dinosaur: a small skull, a long and {{flexible}} neck composed of 10 cervical vertebrae, a stocky body, and a long, mobile tail composed of at least 40 caudal vertebrae. The arms of Plateosaurus were very short, even compared to most other [...] "prosauropods". However, they were strongly built, with hands adapted for powerful grasping. The shoulder girdle was narrow (often misaligned in skeletal mounts and drawings), with the clavicles (collar bones) touching at the body's midline, as in other basal sauropodomorphs. The hind limbs were held under the body, with slightly flexed knees and ankles, and the foot was digitigrade, meaning the animal walked on its toes. The proportionally long lower leg and <b>metatarsus</b> show that Plateosaurus could run quickly on its hind limbs. The tail of Plateosaurus was typically dinosaurian, muscular and with high mobility.|$|E
500|$|The Rodrigues parrot was {{described}} as being the largest parrot species on the island, with a big head and a long tail. Its plumage {{was described}} as being of uniform green colouration. Its skull was flat and depressed compared to those of most other parrots, but similar to the genus Ara. The skull was [...] long without the beak, [...] wide, and [...] deep. The coracoid (part of the shoulder) was [...] long, the humerus (upper-arm bone) , the ulna (lower-arm bone) , the femur (thigh-bone) , the tibia (lower-leg bone) , and the <b>metatarsus</b> (foot bone) [...] Its exact body length is unknown, but {{it may have been}} around , comparable {{to the size of a}} large cockatoo. Its tibia was 32% smaller than that of a female broad-billed parrot, yet the pectoral bones were of similar size, and proportionally its head was the largest of any Mascarene species of parrot.|$|E
500|$|Geographic {{differences}} in dire wolves were not detected until 1984, when {{a study of}} skeletal remains showed {{differences in}} a few cranio-dental features and limb proportions between specimens from California and Mexico (C.d.guildayi) and those found from {{the east of the}} Continental Divide (C.d.dirus). A comparison of limb size shows that the rear limbs of C.d.guildayi were 8% shorter than the Yukon wolf due to a significantly shorter tibia and <b>metatarsus,</b> and that the front limbs were also shorter due to their slightly shorter lower bones. With its comparatively lighter and smaller limbs and massive head, C.d.guildayi was not as well adapted for running as timber wolves and coyotes. C.d.dirus possessed significantly longer limbs than C.d.guildayi. The forelimbs were 14% longer than C.d.guildayi due to 10% longer humeri, 15% longer radii, and 15% longer metacarpals. The rear limbs were 10% longer than C.d.guildayi due to 10% longer femora and tibiae, and 15% longer metatarsals. C.d.dirus is comparable to the Yukon wolf in limb length. The largest C.d.dirus femur was found in Carroll Cave, Missouri, and measured [...]|$|E
500|$|Jack Horner and Don Lessem {{argued in}} 1993 that Tyrannosaurus {{was slow and}} {{probably}} could not run (no airborne phase in mid-stride), because its ratio of femur (thigh bone) to tibia (shin bone) length was greater than 1, as in most large theropods and like a modern elephant. Holtz (1998) noted that tyrannosaurids and some closely related groups had significantly longer distal hindlimb components (shin plus foot plus toes) relative to the femur length than most other theropods, and that tyrannosaurids and their close relatives had a tightly interlocked <b>metatarsus</b> that more effectively transmitted locomotory forces from the foot to the lower leg than in earlier theropods ("metatarsus" [...] means the foot bones, which function {{as part of the}} leg in digitigrade animals). He therefore concluded that tyrannosaurids and their close relatives were the fastest large theropods. Thomas Holtz Jr. echoed these sentiments in his 2013 lecture, stating that the giant allosaurs had shorter feet for the same body size than Tyrannosaurus, whereas Tyrannosaurus had longer, skinnier and more interlocked feet for the same body size; attributes of faster moving animals.|$|E
500|$|It {{is similar}} in size to Velociraptor, with Balaurs {{recovered}} skeletal elements suggesting an overall length of around [...] Balaur had re-evolved a functional first toe used to support its weight, which bore a large claw that could be hyperextended. It had short and stocky feet and legs, and large muscle attachment areas on the pelvis which indicate that it was adapted for strength rather than speed. [...] Csiki et al. describe this [...] "novel body plan" [...] as [...] "a dramatic example of aberrant morphology developed in island-dwelling taxa." [...] The stocky feet are exemplified by {{the length of the}} <b>metatarsus</b> being only two times its width. It is 1.5 times wider than the lower leg. Both traits are unique in the Theropoda. The skeleton of Balaur also shows extensive fusion of limb bones. Wrist bones and the metacarpals are fused into a carpometacarpus. The pelvic bones are fused. The shinbone, calf bone and the upper ankle bones have been fused into a tibiotarsus and the lower ankle bones and the metatarsals into a tarsometatarsus. The degree of fusion is typical for the Avialae, the evolutionary branch of the birds and their direct relatives.|$|E
500|$|Subfossil {{bones of}} a starling-like bird were first {{discovered}} on Rodrigues {{by the police}} magistrate George Jenner In 1866 and 1871, and by the reverend Henry Horrocks Slater in 1874. They were found in caves on the Plaine Coral, a limestone plain in south-west Rodrigues. These bones included the cranium, mandible, sternum, coracoid, humerus, metacarpus, ulna, femur, tibia, and <b>metatarsus</b> of several birds; the bones were deposited in the British Museum and the Cambridge Museum. In 1879, the bones became {{the basis of a}} scientific description of the bird by ornithologists Albert Günther and Edward Newton (the brother of Alfred). They named the bird Necropsar rodericanus; Nekros and psar are Greek for [...] "dead" [...] and [...] "starling", while rodericanus refers to the island of Rodrigues. This binomial was originally proposed by Slater in an 1874 manuscript he sent to Günther and Newton. Slater had prepared the manuscript for an 1879 publication, which was never released, but Günther and Newton quoted Slater's unpublished notes in their own 1879 article, and credited him for the name. BirdLife International credits Slater rather than Günther and Newton for the name. Günther and Newton determined that the Rodrigues starling was closely related to the hoopoe starling, and they only kept it in a separate genus due to what they termed [...] "present ornithological practice". Due to the strongly built bill, they considered the new species likely the same as the bird mentioned in Tafforet's account.|$|E
500|$|The Rodrigues rail was a flightless rail {{with bright}} grey plumage, perhaps flecked with white. Its beak and legs were red, {{and it had}} a red, naked area (or wattle) around its eyes. Its exact size is unknown, but it was {{about the size of a}} chicken, and {{somewhat}} smaller than the related red rail. Subfossil remains exhibit a large variation in size, which may reflect sexual dimorphism. The cranium of the Rodrigues rail was slightly elongate, convex in every direction, and was [...] long and [...] wide. The cranium had a narrow, long frontal region, [...] at its least width. The beak varied greatly in size and shape; some specimens had short and almost straight beaks, and others had much longer beaks (up to one third longer) that were prominently curved. It is unknown whether this was related to the overall size of an individual bird or to sexual dimorphism. The culmen of the beak was almost straight above the nostril, and the nasal bone was slightly longer than the cranium. The beak was up to [...] long, the lower jaw up to [...] long, and [...] at its greatest depth. The scapula (shoulder blade) was [...] long, the humerus ranged from , and the ulna from [...] The pelvis was large and strongly built in proportion to the size of the bird, was [...] long, [...] wide at the front, and [...] wide at the back.

500|$|In 2011, Denver Fowler {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} a new {{method by which}} Deinonychus and other dromaeosaurs may have captured and restrained prey. This model, known as the [...] "raptor prey restraint" [...] (RPR) model of predation, proposes that Deinonychus killed its prey in a manner very similar to extant accipitrid birds of prey: by leaping onto its quarry, pinning it under its body weight, and gripping it tightly with the large, sickle-shaped claws. Like accipitrids, the dromaeosaur would then begin to feed on the animal while still alive, until it eventually died from blood loss and organ failure. This proposal is based primarily on comparisons between the morphology and proportions of the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs to several groups of extant birds of prey with known predatory behaviors. Fowler found that the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs most closely resemble those of eagles and hawks, {{especially in terms of}} having an enlarged second claw and a similar range of grasping motion. However, the short <b>metatarsus</b> and foot strength would have been more similar to that of owls. The RPR method of predation would be consistent with other aspects of Deinonychuss anatomy, such as their unusual jaw and arm morphology. The arms were likely covered in long feathers, and may have been used as flapping stabilizers for balance while atop a struggling prey animal, along with the stiff counterbalancing tail. Its jaws, thought to have had a comparatively weak bite force, might be used for saw motion bites, like the modern Komodo dragon which also has a weak bite force, to finish off its prey if its kicks were not powerful enough.|$|E

These predatory adaptations working together may also have implications for the origin of flapping in paravians.|$|E
500|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{behavior}} of Balaur. Because of the lack of skull material, it is impossible to determine by the shape of the teeth whether Balaur was a carnivore or a herbivore. The original description assumed it was carnivorous because it had been found that it was closely related to Velociraptor. Csiki speculated in 2010 that it may {{have been one of the}} apex predators in its limited island ecosystem, because of larger theropods not even the teeth have ever been found in Romania. He also believed that it likely used its double sickle claws for slashing prey, and that the atrophied state of its hands indicates that it probably did not use them to hunt. One of the original discoverers indicated that it [...] "was probably more of a kickboxer than a sprinter" [...] compared to Velociraptor, and was probably able to hunt larger animals than itself. However, more recent studies by Denver Fowler and others have shown that the foot anatomy of paravians like Balaur indicate that they used their large claws to grip and pin prey to the ground while flapping with their proto-wings to stay on top of their victim. Once it was worn out, they might have proceeded to feast while it was still alive as some modern birds of prey still do. Due to the shape of the claws, they would not have been effective in slashing attacks. The very short, fused <b>metatarsus</b> of Balaur and enlarged first claw, strange even by dromaeosaur standards, are thought to be consistent with these newer studies, lending further support to the idea that Balaur was a predator.|$|E
500|$|Deinocheirus and Therizinosaurus {{possessed the}} longest forelimbs known for any bipedal dinosaurs. The holotype forelimbs measure [...] long — the humerus (upper arm bone) is , the ulna , {{and the hand}} is [...] — {{including}} the [...] long recurved claws. Each scapulocoracoid of the shoulder girdle has a length of [...] Each half of the paired [...] measure [...] The shoulder-blade was long and narrow, and the deltopectoralis crest was pronounced and triangular. The upper arm (humerus) was relatively slender, and only slightly longer than the hand. The ulna and radius (lower arm bones) were elongate and not firmly connected {{to each other in}} a syndesmosis. The metacarpus was long compared to the fingers. The three fingers were about equal in length, the first being the stoutest and the second the longest. Various rough areas and impressions on the forelimbs indicate the presence of powerful muscles. Most articular surfaces of the arm bones were deeply furrowed, indicating that the animal had thick pads of cartilage between the joints. Though the arms of Deinocheirus were large, the ratio between them and the shoulder girdle was less than that of the smaller ornithomimosaur Ornithomimus. The arm bones of Deinocheirus were similar in proportions to those of the small theropod Compsognathus. The wishbone (furcula), an element not known from any other ornithomimosaurs, was U-shaped. The hindlimbs were relatively short, and the thigh bone (femur) was longer than the shin bone (tibia), as is common for large animals. The <b>metatarsus</b> was short and not arctometatarsalian, as in most other theropods. The claw bones of the feet were blunt and broad-tipped instead of tapered, unlike other theropods, but resembled the unguals of large ornithischian dinosaurs. The proportions of the toe bones resembled those of tyrannosaurs, due to the large weight they had to bear.|$|E
