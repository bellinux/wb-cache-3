6000|$|About {{four in the}} {{afternoon}} I sent for the corps commanders and directed the dispositions {{to be made of}} their troops. Sherman was to remain in Jackson until he destroyed that place as a railroad centre, and manufacturing city of military supplies. He did the work most effectually. Sherman and I went together into a manufactory which had not ceased work on account of the battle nor for the entrance of Yankee troops. Our presence did not seem {{to attract the attention of}} either the manager or the operatives, most of whom were girls. We looked on for a while to see the tent cloth which they were <b>making</b> <b>roll</b> out of the looms, with [...] "C. S. A." [...] woven in each bolt. There was an immense amount of cotton, in bales, stacked outside. Finally I told Sherman I thought they had done work enough. The operatives were told they could leave and take with them what cloth they could carry. In a few minutes cotton and factory were in a blaze. The proprietor visited Washington while I was President to get his pay for this property, claiming that it was private. He asked me to give him a statement of the fact that his property had been destroyed by National troops, so that he might use it with Congress where he was pressing, or proposed to press, his claim. I declined.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{the first}} mass {{production}} car with {{front to rear}} mechanical interconnected suspension was the 1948 Citroën 2CV. The suspension of the 2CV was extremely soft—the longitudinal link was making pitch softer instead of <b>making</b> <b>roll</b> stiffer. It relied on extreme antidive and antisquat geometries to compensate for that. This redunded into a softer axle crossing stiffness that anti-roll bars would have otherwise compromised. The leading arm / trailing arm swinging arm, fore-aft linked suspension system together with inboard front brakes had a much smaller unsprung weight than existing coil spring or leaf designs. The interconnection transmitted some of the force deflecting a front wheel up over a bump, to push the rear wheel down on the same side. When the rear wheel met that bump a moment later, it did the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear. The 2CV had a design brief {{to be able to}} be driven at speed over a ploughed field. It originally featured friction dampers and tuned mass dampers. Later models had tuned mass dampers at the front with telescopic dampers/shock absorbers front and rear.|$|E

Combat against an Ancient One varies, but typically involves <b>making</b> <b>rolls</b> to remove tokens from it, while the Ancient One lowers their stats each turn or takes certain tokens from them. Investigators who lose all of that token type are immediately devoured and removed from the game. If the Ancient One is defeated, the players win; otherwise, the game is over and they have lost.|$|R

50|$|A cigar is {{in essence}} {{a bundle of}} rolled cured tobacco leaves.The rolling process {{can be done by}} hand, {{creating}} a more expensive luxury item, or in a factory. The factory method produces more uniform shapes and is much less expensive.Demand for cigars was high during the 18th and 19th century. The demand created a specialized workforce, first in Cuba and South America. In the mid to late 1800’s more workers in the United States were taught in the art of cigar <b>making.</b> <b>Rolling</b> a cigar is a skilled labor; it can take up to one year for an apprentice to master the art and become proficient in rolling a cigar.|$|R

This allows you to choose to fail in your main attempt, but in an ultimately beneficial way, or conversely succeed in your main intent, but with disastrous consequences.|$|R
