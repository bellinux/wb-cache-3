5|$|Although the {{rebellion}} did not itself achieve lasting success, {{it is commonly}} cited as a watershed <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> Nyasaland history. The rebellion had lasting effects on the British system of administration in Nyasaland and some reform was enacted in its aftermath. After World War II, the growing Malawian nationalist movement reignited interest in the Chilembwe revolt, and after the independence of Malawi in 1964 it became celebrated as a key <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> the nation's history. Chilembwe's memory, which remains prominent in the collective national consciousness, has often been invoked in symbolism and rhetoric by Malawian politicians. Today, the uprising is celebrated annually and Chilembwe himself is considered a national hero.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Moment-based {{procedures}} {{are commonly used}} in computer vision, image analysis, or pattern recognition. Basic shape features such as size, position, orientation, or elongation are estimated by moments of order ≤ 2. Shape invariants are defined by higher order <b>moments.</b> <b>In</b> contrast to a theory of <b>moments</b> <b>in</b> continuous mathematics, shape <b>moments</b> <b>in</b> imaging have to be estimated from digitized data. Infinitely many different shapes in Euclidean space are represented by an identical digital shape. There is an inherent loss of information, impacting moment estimation. This paper discusses accuracy limitations <b>in</b> <b>moment</b> reconstruction <b>in</b> dependency of order of reconstructed moments and applied resolution of digital pictures. We consider moments of arbitrary order, which is not assumed to be bounded by a constant...|$|R

5|$|Modern historians {{describe}} the Royal Question {{as an important}} <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> Belgian recovery after World War II. The opposition between Leopoldists and anti-Leopoldists led to the re-establishment of Socialist and Catholic political parties from before the war. The Question was also an important <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> the Belgian linguistic conflict. It also {{put an end to}} the federalisation of Belgian institutions which might exacerbate the regional tensions exposed by the Royal Question. In addition, the perceived failure of the PSC–CVP to realise Flemish demands for the return of Leopold helped to strengthen support for the Flemish nationalist Volksunie party after 1954. In Wallonia, the legacy of trade union and socialist political mobilisation during the general strike paved the way for a left-wing revival of the Walloon Movement.|$|E
