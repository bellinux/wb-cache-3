The first chapters are devoted to the explanation of basic terms, the geological description {{of the region and}} the history of earthquakes in the region. The historical development of <b>macroseismic</b> <b>scales</b> and {{a detailed description of the}} EMS- 98, used for the evaluation of the 2008 earthquake swarm data, are contained in the following chapters. The main part of the present work deals with the manual macroseismic evaluation of the swarm followed by a description of the program for the automatic evaluation of data. The program results were found to agree with the manual evaluation. In the next part there is a detailed description of a program for drawing isoseismal lines.

April 24 and 1846, August 14) which have a good historical documentation. Nevertheless, it is difficult to obtain the data required by the scales.

40|$|Earthquake Environmental Effects (EEEs) are any {{phenomena}} {{generated in}} the natural environment by a seismic event. An earthquake intensity scale (INQUA scale) based on EEEs was presented in MICHETTI et alii (2004). The use of this new scale, combined and integrated with traditional <b>macroseismic</b> <b>scales,</b> is recommended for many reasons including: i) the EEE sizes are the only reliable tool for the intensity estimates of strong earthquakes (I≥X) as they do not suffer from saturation; ii) they are independent from cultural and technological aspects {{and so they are}} able to give homogeneous earthquake intensity assessments at global scale; iii) they provide the most long-term picture of seismicity (recent, historical and paleo earthquakes). The ongoing worldwide testing of the INQUA’s EEE intensity scale is based on standardized data formats and procedures, to reduce subjectivity. The archive developed to store information regarding EEEs and corresponding intensities is based on three spatial levels: site, locality, and total affected area. Two case studies (historical and recent) from different geotectonic environments are used here to show the power of the EEE scale, able, depending on completeness of dataset, to provide a detailed spatial distribution of intensity, or, with the limited data available for old earthquakes, at least an intensity for the epicentral area. Though the EEE intensity scale itself {{does not take into account}} damage distribution, the comprehensive earthquake study requires analysis of all observed effects on environment and constructions. The use of both traditional <b>macroseismic</b> and EEE <b>scales</b> can ensure the most complete image of the earthquake; the INQUA scale is not intended to replace previous <b>macroseismic</b> <b>scales,</b> but rather to integrate them. The project is in progress and open issues listed in the conclusions still can be solved based on further application of the scale to case studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{perception}} of an earthquake {{depends on whether}} the observer is located on a lower or upper floor within a building. <b>Macroseismic</b> <b>scales</b> propose only a qualitative description of the varying effects felt that are dependent on the floor the observer is on.

The questionnaires pertain to buildings no more than 10 stories high and are derived from municipalities experiencing a Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg (MCS) intensity {{less than or equal}} to VII with the majority being III and IV. We find that the intensity variation caused by the increased shaking on upper floors can be quantified. The upper floor intensity increases by 0. 4 MCS compared with ground and underground levels. After correcting for an average floor-dependence factor, we find a further building height effect evident in short buildings that are probably exposed to less intense shaking. This effect displays a variation with the hypocentral distance reaching an MCS intensity of - 0. 3 at distances on the order of 200 km...|$|R

40|$|A {{major problem}} in {{assessing}} macroseismic intensity from historical records {{is the lack of}} a standardized procedure for processing documentary sources and supplying unequivocal intensity estimates. In fact, most <b>macroseismic,</b> <b>scales</b> do not include detailed descriptions of procedures for intensity assessment and many divergent interpretations of intensity values arc obtained by different operators. In order to disclose these problems an experiment was made in Italy in 1994, in the framework of GNDT "Seismicity" Working Group. A set of selected documents concerning origil 1 al descriptions of effects produced by earthquakes which had occurred in Italy from 15 th to 20 th century, was supplied to a number of independent researchers. Each of them was invited to assess on this basis the intensity values and to explain his intellectual path by describing it in detail. This documentation was finally collected and, during a meeting devoted to this topic, the researchers involved were invited to discuss their personal experiences. The discussion indicated that the discrepancies between the estimate obtained by the different authors from the same documentary source are, in many cases, greater than 1 degree. This implies that the effect of personal choices may {{play an important role in}} intensity assessment and makes intensity estimates performed by the different authors less comparable. At present no definitive conclusions about these problems can be drawn but the topics focused during the meeting may represent a useful basis for a wider discussion to define a standardized procedure for thc assessment of intensity from documentary data...|$|R
40|$|The Mw 5. 7 {{earthquake}} that occurred on 12 May 1802 {{is the only}} one with Mw ≥ 5. 5 located west of Lake Garda in the central-northern part of the Po Plain, Northern Italy, and the strongest event located in the seismic zone 907 of the ZS 9 seismogenic zonation of Italy. Current parametric earthquake catalogs locate the event not far from important cities (e. g., Milan) and to sites where nuclear power plants were to be built in the 1980 s or could be built in a near future. Although the earthquake parameters seemed sufficiently well constrained, a detailed investigation of documentary sources was performed, in repositories storing the documents of the Napoleonic departments to which the area affected by the earthquake belonged at that time. In the surviving archival series, we found the officers’ correspondence on all the administrative aspects raised by the earthquake. The newly collected records allowed the authors to significantly increase the number of macroseismic intensity data, including new observations in the most damaged area. The results have been then interpreted in terms of both Mercalli–Cancani–Sieberg and EMS 98 <b>macroseismic</b> <b>scales.</b> The earthquake parameters were derived applying two different methods in order to get two independent estimates.

40|$|Intensity {{attenuation}} and its variation as {{a function}} of the distance and earthquake size is still a critical issue in evaluating seismic hazard. We present a method that allows us to incorporate additional information from the historical earthquake felt reports in the probability estimation of local intensity attenuation. The approach is based on two ideas: a) standard intensity versus epicentral distance relationships constitute an unnecessary filter between observations and estimates; and b) the intensity decay process is affected by many, scarcely known elements (the physical parameters of the source, propagation path effects, building vulnerability, the semi-qualitative character of <b>macroseismic</b> <b>scales,</b> etc.). Hence intensity decay should be treated as a random variable as is the macroseismic intensity. We assume here that decay, defined on the set { 0, 1, [...] ., I 0 }, follows a binomial distribution with parameters (I 0, p); p depends on the distance from the epicenter and is related to the probability of null decay at that distance. According to the Bayesian approach this p parameter is, in turn, a Beta random variable. The observations related to earthquakes with their epicenter outside the area concerned, but belonging to homogeneous zones, are used as prior knowledge of the phenomenon, while the data points of events inside the area are used to update the estimates through the posterior means of the quantities involved. Our methodology is described in detail in an application to the Umbria-Marche area in Central Italy. The data sets examined are the macroseismic intensity database DOM 4. 1 and the zonation ZS. 4, both compiled by the Italian Group for Defence against Earthquakes (GNDT).

This complex work of research and organisation has been conducted according to two main perspectives: the historical and the geological point of view. As regards the historical point of view, {{on the one hand}} the elements of complexity have been highlighted relative to data which, particularly before the seventeenth century, had been produced within cognitive and cultural contexts which are now extremely remote and beyond naturalistic logic. On the other hand, from the seventeenth century, the growing attention of the cultural élite of the era towards environmental phenomena (now being seen within a naturalistic perspective), favoured the gradual enhancement of the corpus of information, also as regards the quality of the data. 2053 effects of earthquakes on the environment are listed in the CFTI 3, classified into five categories which are in turn divided into other descriptive typologies. Many examples are also provided with the purpose of outlining the specific problems concerning the available data. As regards the geological point of view, the effects described in historical sources may be divided into two categories: the effects related to shaking, and the effects which may be due directly to the seismogenic source, generally with less territorial impact but of considerable scientific interest.

50|$|An {{engineering}} consultant, {{using the}} 1990 Bishop's Castle earthquake specifications as a model, {{has estimated that}} the slightly weaker 2002 Dudley earthquake measuring 4.8 on the Richter scale would have caused structural damage of an order costing less than 5% {{of the cost of}} the complete reconstruction of an entire property to repair, to 1% of buildings situated in towns in the vicinity of the epicentre. While some indication of the typical percentage of homes damaged to a similarly minor extent by a slightly stronger earthquake measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale may be extrapolated from this estimation, a representative of the British Geological Survey has stated that 'numerous' but fewer than 20% of properties in Shrewsbury suffered the partial or total loss of their chimneys or damage of equivalent gravity (see below). Reliable, exact figures of the percentage of buildings damaged close to the epicentre of the 1990 Bishop's Castle earthquake are not readily available, but the aforesaid sources taken together appear clearly to indicate that between 1% and 20% of properties in towns near the epicentre suffered damage of European <b>Macroseismic</b> <b>Scale</b> Grade 7 severity.|$|E

Aftershocks occurred until 5 March.Striking in the early afternoon, the earthquake caused hundreds of casualties and destroyed numerous buildings. In Udine, the castle and the cathedral were severely damaged. In Carinthia, the town of Villach and numerous surrounding villages were largely destroyed by a major landslide followed by a flood of the Gail River. Even in Rome the earthquake allegedly took a toll: considerable damage was sustained by the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore; in the Torre delle Milizie, an upper floor crumbled, and the structure assumed the slight tilt it retains today. The sixth-century basilica of Santi Apostoli was so utterly ruined that it was left in an abandoned state for a generation.|$|E

The wide diffusion of Internet and the citizen collaboration (crowdsourcing) allow documentation of information on seismic effects and production of a macroseismic field with low costs and almost in real time. Transformation from qualitative information (as given by ques- tionnaires) to numerical quantification is a crucial issue. In the traditional evaluation of intensity, experts used to work through a complex comparison of effects basically driven by personal expe- rience. The major problem with this approach concerns the dif- ficulty in verifing and reproducing the evaluation process {{due to the lack}} of a detailed explanation of the employed workflow and to the large variability of possible cases. On the other hand, an automatic method for the estimation of macroseismic intensities needs to be completely well defined and specified in order to be reproducible and verifiable. For these reasons, this paper presents a comprehensive explanation of our intensity assessment method. A useful automatic method for intensity assessment should be computationally fast and strictly follow the <b>macroseismic</b> <b>scales.</b> To meet these requirements in 2010, we proposed a method that firstly quantified the effects using additive scores associated with each answer of the questionnaire item and then determined an intensity estimate for each questionnaire (Sbarra et al., 2010). After a trial period and having collected more than 500, 000 questionnaires, we were able to thoroughly test the method. As a result of this testing, we describe here a new improved method that takes into account further factors, such as the situation and the location of the observer (Sbarra et al., 2012, 2014), to obtain a more accurate estimate of the macroseismic intensity degree at the municipality level. In this paper, we show some applications of our method with reference to the Mercalli–Cancani–Sieberg (MCS) scale, because this scale has long been used with Italian earthquakes and allows easy comparison between these intensities and other traditional ones...|$|R

The observed and computed peak acceleration values, at nearby sites, agree well...|$|R
50|$|Starting {{from the}} earlier years of the human history {{generally}} to evaluate {{the intensity of the}} earthquakes is used to observe them according their effects to the environment (destruction, damages)But generally, in these comparison there were many subjective factors based on the human feelings.The strength of the earthquakes is changing according to its distance. In the 19th century there were attempts to classify earthquakes according to their damages to our lives, geological environment etc. At the end of that century there was widely spread the Rossi- Forel (RF) earthquake intensity scale. In these scale the earthquakes intensity is divided to ten points.In 1902 in Italy by the Juzeppe Merkali has been adopted the scale of 12 points. In 1931 the American scientists Q. Vud. And F. Nyumen and in 1956 the Richter has made a few changes in that scale. And now this scale is called modified Merkalli and Richter scale (MMI)From the 1964 the in Europe and in Ex Soviet Union where Azerbaijan was one of the members has been accepted the 12 unit European MSK Scale. The name of the scale was composed from the capital letter of its founders. S.V. Medvedev (USSR) V. SHponkhoyer, (GDR) and Karnik. (Chekoslovakia) There is an additional 12 points European <b>Macroseismic</b> (EMS) <b>scale</b> except MMI And MSK scales. And also there is a scale of Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) with 7 unit scale is existing.|$|R

The open-source software SELENA, which is a joint development of NORSAR (Norway) and the University of Alicante (Spain), is undergoing a constant development. One of the more recent features being included is the possibility to address topographic amplification of seismic ground motion. Additionally, SELENA has been adapted by including various methods for the analytical computation of structural damage and loss. SELENA now offers complete flexibility in the use of different types of fragility curves based on various ground motion intensity parameters (e. g. PGA, Sa, Sd), which has been suggested by many recently released guidelines (e. g. FEMA P- 58, GEM-ASV, SYNER-G, HAZUS- MH). Besides, under the framework of the ongoing Horizon 2020 LIQUEFACT project, SELENA is extended in order to allow the consideration of liquefaction-induced ground displacements and respective structural damage. In general, software tools for ELE are particularly useful in two different settings, i. e., for disaster management and (re) insurance purposes. Both sectors pose very different demands on ELE studies: while the (re) insurance sector is foremost interested in the direct and indirect economic losses caused by an earthquake to its insured physical assets, those institutions (often governmental and non- governmental organizations) in charge of disaster emergency management and response are more interested in reliable estimates on human losses and the potential short- and long-term social consequences. Being aware about these peculiar differences between software tools for disaster management and insurance applications, NORSAR/UA thereby offers two in its core similar software tools, i. e., the open-source software SELENA and the proprietary software PML (Probable Maximum Loss) which is actively used by the insurance association in Chile (South America) since 2011. The present research has been benefited from funding of NORSAR and the Univ. Alicante through research contracts (NORSAR 1 - 14 A, NORSAR 1 - 08 I), the funding of the Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad (CGL 2016 - 77688 -R) and the Generalitat Valenciana (BEST/ 2012 / 173 and AICO/ 2016 / 098). The development and implementation of the liquefaction risk assessment methodology is done under the LIQUEFACT project funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement (No. 700748) ...|$|R
