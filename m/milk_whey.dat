2500|$|The daily {{beverages}} included <b>milk,</b> <b>whey,</b> buttermilk {{and various}} herb infusions. The most popular alcoholic beverages were beer and mead; however in the 16th century upper classes began to import Hungarian and Silesian wines. Mead was so widespread {{that in the}} 13th century Prince Leszek I the White explained to the Pope that Polish knights could not participate in a crusade as there was no mead in the Holy Land. Also, vodka became popular, possibly among the lower classes first. There is written evidence suggesting that vodka originated in Poland. The word [...] "vodka" [...] was recorded {{for the first time}} ever in 1405 in Akta Grodzkie, the court documents from the Palatinate of Sandomierz in Poland. At that time, the word wódka (vodka) referred to chemical compounds such as medicines and cosmetic cleansers, while the popular beverage was called gorzałka [...] (from the Old Polish gorzeć).|$|E
2500|$|Manufacturers {{state that}} the {{composition}} of infant formula {{is designed to be}} roughly based on a human mother's milk at approximately one to three months postpartum; however, there are significant differences in the nutrient content of these products. [...] The most commonly used infant formulas contain purified cow's <b>milk</b> <b>whey</b> and casein as a protein source, a blend of vegetable oils as a fat source, lactose as a carbohydrate source, a vitamin-mineral mix, and other ingredients depending on the manufacturer. In addition, there are infant formulas using soybean as a protein source in place of cow's milk (mostly in the United States and Great Britain) and formulas using protein hydrolysed into its component amino acids for infants who are allergic to other proteins. An upswing in breastfeeding in many countries has been accompanied by a deferment in the average age of introduction of baby foods (including cow's milk), resulting in both increased breastfeeding and increased use of infant formula between the ages of 3- and 12-months.|$|E

40|$|In this study, high {{pressure}} (HP) -induced denaturation of alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-la) and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) in dairy systems was examined. in both <b>milk</b> and <b>whey,</b> beta-lg was less baroresistant than alpha-la; both proteins were considerably {{more resistant to}} HP-induced denaturation in <b>whey</b> than in <b>milk.</b> HP-induced denaturation of alpha-la and beta-lg increased with increasing proportion of milk in mixtures of <b>milk</b> and <b>whey.</b> Addition of a sulphydryl-oxidising agent, KlO(3), to <b>milk</b> or <b>whey</b> increased HP-induced denaturation of beta-lg, but reduced the denaturation of alpha-la. Denaturation of both alpha-la and beta-lg was prevented by adding a sulphydrylblocking agent, N-ethylmaleimide, to <b>milk</b> or <b>whey</b> prior to HIP treatment, highlighting the crucial role of sulphydryl-clisulphide interchange reactions in HP-induced denaturation of alpha-la and beta-lg. Removal of colloidal calcium phosphate from milk also reduced HP-induced denaturation of alpha-lg and beta-lg significantly. The higher level of HP-induced denaturation of alpha-la and beta-lg in <b>milk</b> than in <b>whey</b> {{may be the result}} of the abscence of the casein micelles and colloidal calcium phosphate from whey, which facilitate HP-induced denaturation of a-la and beta-lg in milk...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Kjeldahl {{method and}} four classic {{spectrophotometric}} methods (Biuret, Lowry, Bradford and Markwell) {{were applied to}} evaluate the protein content of samples of UHT whole milk deliberately adulterated with melamine, ammonium sulphate or urea, {{which can be used}} to defraud <b>milk</b> protein and <b>whey</b> contents. Compared with the Kjeldahl method, the response of the spectrophotometric methods was unaffected by the addition of the nitrogen compounds to <b>milk</b> or <b>whey.</b> The methods of Bradford and Markwell were most robust and did not exhibit interference subject to composition. However, the simultaneous interpretation of results obtained using these methods with those obtained using the Kjeldahl method indicated the addition of nitrogen-rich compounds to <b>milk</b> and/or <b>whey.</b> Therefore, this work suggests a combination of results of Kjeldahl and spectrophotometric methods should be used to screen for milk adulteration by these compounds...|$|R

40|$|Grapevine powdery mildew, {{caused by}} the fungus Erysiphe (Uncinula) necator, is a major disease {{affecting}} grape yield and quality worldwide. In conventional vineyards, the disease is controlled mainly by regular applications of sulfur and synthetic fungicides and, in organic agriculture, by sulfur and botanical and mineral oils. Research has identified <b>milk</b> and <b>whey</b> as potential replacements for synthetic fungicides and sulfur in the control of powdery mildew. Electron spin resonance and scanning electron microscopy were used to investigate the possible mode or modes of action of <b>milk</b> and <b>whey</b> in the control of powdery mildew. Electron spin resonance experiments showed that various components of milk produced oxygen radicals in natural light, which {{may have contributed to}} the reduction of severity of powdery mildew on treated leaves. <b>Milk</b> and <b>whey</b> caused the hyphae of E. necator to collapse and damaged conidia within 24 h of treatment. Hydrogen peroxide, applied as a source of free radicals, also caused collapse of the hyphae of E. necator but did not damage conidia, and appeared to stimulate germination. Lactoferrin (an antimicrobial component of milk) ruptured conidia, but damage to hyphae was not evident until 48 h after treatment. The results support the hypothesis that free radical production and the action of lactoferrin are associated with the control of powdery mildew by milk...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} of bulk starter fermentation strategy for {{production of a}} cost-effective and GRAS source of β-galactosidase from a starter culture strain Lactobacillus bulgaricus was investigated. Three different media were selected and the strain, L. bulgaricus DSM 20081 was cultivated in these media under pH-controlled condition (pH = 5. 6) at 43 °C. The media were: bulk starter medium based on skim <b>milk</b> + <b>whey,</b> bulk starter medium based on <b>whey,</b> and skim <b>milk.</b> Growth and β-lactic acid production parameters were estimated from experimental data with the Garcia and Luedeking-Piret models, respectively. β-galactosidase production kinetics was also simulated using models based on biomass concentration and lactic acid production. Growth in the bulk starter medium based on skim <b>milk</b> + <b>whey</b> resulted in {{a higher rate of}} lactic acid production (7. 35 ± 0. 23   mg lactic acid ml - 1 media h - 1) and β-galactosidase activity (800. 1 ± 0. 7 nmol ONP ml - 1 media) compared to the other two media (P < 0. 01). Simulation of β- galactosidase production based on rate of lactic acid production resulted in very good agreement with experimental data for all three tested media.
