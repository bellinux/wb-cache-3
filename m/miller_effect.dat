For example, when used as an active load in a differential amplifier, I1 ≈ −I2, making the output impedance of the mirror approximately R22 -R21 ≈ 2 β rORE /(rπ + 2RE) compared to only rO without feedback (that is with RE = 0 Ω) [...] At the same time, the impedance on the reference side of the mirror is approximately [...] R11−R12 ≈ , only a moderate value, but still larger than rE with no feedback.

2500|$|The dual-gate MOSFET has a tetrode configuration, {{where both}} gates control the current in the device. It is {{commonly}} used for small-signal devices in radio frequency applications where biasing the drain-side gate at constant potential reduces the gain loss caused by <b>Miller</b> <b>effect,</b> replacing two separate transistors in cascode configuration. Other common uses in RF circuits include gain control and mixing (frequency conversion). The [...] "tetrode" [...] description, though accurate, does not replicate the vacuum-tube tetrode. Vacuum-tube tetrodes, using a screen grid, exhibit much lower grid-plate capacitance and much higher output impedance and voltage gains than triode vacuum tubes. These improvements are commonly {{an order of magnitude}} (10 times) or considerably more. Tetrode transistors (whether bipolar junction or field-effect) do not exhibit improvements of such a great degree.|$|E
2500|$|To {{combat the}} {{stability}} problems and limited voltage gain {{due to the}} <b>Miller</b> <b>effect,</b> the physicist Walter H. Schottky invented the tetrode tube in 1919. He showed that {{the addition of a}} second grid, located between the control grid and the plate (anode), known as the screen grid, could solve these problems. ("Screen" [...] in this case refers to electrical [...] "screening" [...] or shielding, not physical construction: all [...] "grid" [...] electrodes in between the cathode and plate are [...] "screens" [...] of some sort rather than solid electrodes since they must allow for the passage of electrons directly from the cathode to the plate). A positive voltage slightly lower than the plate (anode) voltage was applied to it, and was bypassed (for high frequencies) to ground with a capacitor. This arrangement decoupled the anode and the control grid, essentially eliminating the Miller capacitance and its associated problems. Consequently, higher voltage gains from a single tube became possible, reducing the number of tubes required in many circuits. This two-grid tube is called a tetrode, meaning four active electrodes, and was common by 1926.|$|E

50|$|Efficiency is {{increased}} {{by having the}} same effective compression ratio and a larger expansion ratio. This allows more work to be extracted from the expanding gases as they are expanded to almost atmospheric pressure. In an ordinary spark ignition engine {{at the end of}} the expansion stroke of a wide open throttle cycle, the gases are at around five atmospheres when the exhaust valve opens. Because the stroke is limited to that of the compression, still some work could be extracted from the gas.

40|$|Abstract—To {{address the}} cost and {{universality}} of ultra-low-power (ULP) radios for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, a sub-GHz multi-ISM-band (433 / 860 / 915 / 960 MHz) ZigBee receiver is developed. It features a gain-boosted N-path switched-capacitor (SC) network embedded into a function-reuse RF front-end, of-fering concurrent RF (common-mode) and BB (differential-mode) amplification, LO-defined RF filtering, and input impedance matching with zero external components. Interestingly, not only the BB power and area are nullified, but also the loading effect between the RF and BB blocks is averted, resulting in better noise figure (NF). Unlike the existing N-path filtering, the described gain-boosted topology offers: 1) double RF filtering at both input and output of the RF front-end; 2) size reduction of the phys-ical capacitors thanks to the <b>Miller</b> multiplication <b>effect,</b> and 3) LO-power saving by decoupling the mixer’s on-resistance to the ultimate stopband rejection. Together with a low-voltage LC-VCO with extensively-distributed negative-gain cells for current-reuse with the BB filters, the receiver achieves 8. 1 ± 0. 6 dB NF, 50 ± 2 dB gain and – 20. 5 ± 1. 5 dBm out-of-band IIP 3 at 1. 15 ± 0. 05 mW power at 0. 5 V over the four ISM bands.
