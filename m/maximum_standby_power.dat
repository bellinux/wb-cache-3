In recent years, the California Energy Commission’s California code of regulations, Title 20 has been revised {{to regulate the}} <b>maximum</b> allowable <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> for a portable electric spa based on the spa volume. The goal of this regulation is to require improvements to the lowest performing models, for which simple and cost effective improvements are readily available, without eliminating average or better performing products. In this research, the <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> of twenty seven portable electric spas was measured and compared to the Title 20 requirement. These tests resulted in nine of the twenty seven spas not meeting the allowable <b>standby</b> <b>power.</b> Analysis demonstrates that simple and inexpensive improvements to these nine spas would likely cause the spas to pass the Title 20 requirement.

40|$|High {{growth in}} the uptake of {{electrical}} appliances is accounting for {{a significant increase in}} electricity consumption globally. In some developed countries, standby energy alone may account for about 10 % of residential electricity use. The <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> for many appliances used in Australia is still well above the national goal of 1 W or less. In this paper, field measurements taken of <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> and operating power for a range of electrical appliances are presented.

40|$|<b>Standby</b> <b>power,</b> {{as defined}} in this paper, is the {{electricity}} consumed by end-use electrical equipment when it is switched off or not performing its main function. <b>Standby</b> <b>power</b> consumption represents an increasing fraction of energy use in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries; the rapid penetration of new and digital technology is likely to accelerate the growth of <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> use. <b>Standby</b> <b>power</b> is currently estimated to account for about 3 to 10 percent of home and office electricity use.

40|$|Abstract—Standby power {{frequently}} {{dominates the}} power bud-get of battery-operated ultralow power sensor nodes. Reducing <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> {{is therefore a}} key challenge for further power reduction. Applying known circuit techniques for <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> reduction is challenging since <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> of state-of-the-art sensor node systems {{is now on the}} order of nanowatts or less. Hence, the overhead of any leakage reduction technique quickly overshadows any gains. This brief proposes an efficient implemen-tation method for super cutoff CMOS that exploits the unique conditions of power gating to enable a highly efficient charge pump design. The proposed techniques are applied to logic blocks and memory devices. For a very low initial <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> value of tens of picowatts, <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> reduction of up to 19. 3 × and 29 % is achieved for logic blocks and memory, respectively.

40|$|Standby Power" {{refers to}} a product or {{appliance}} that is connected to a power source but does not produce any sound or picture, transmit or receive information or is waiting to be switched "on" by a direct or indirect signal from the consumer. This includes the "off" mode, even {{where there is no}} remote control. <b>Standby</b> <b>Power</b> is currently a global problem in the developed world and is estimated to be responsible for 1. 5 % of total electricity consumption. It contributes 0. 6 % (68 million tons) of CO 2 emissions from the electricity sector. At the present time, <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> is a relatively new concept with very few statistics available on the <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> consumption in New Zealand. To date New Zealand has not considered <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> to be important. While almost all first world countries are introducing legislation and making active movements toward reducing <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> in new appliances, New Zealand has yet to take action. There is a growing awareness of <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> in New Zealand that has gained some media coverage. However from this study it is clear that although 89 % of surveyed consumers had heard of <b>standby</b> <b>power,</b> the general consumer was unaware {{of the extent to which}} <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> is emitted through appliances and the amount of power and money it consumes nationally per year. In the midst of a power crisis (at the time of writing, June, 2003), New Zealand has the capability to reduce power consumption by 10 %, by turning all appliances off onto standby. Unfortunately, the lack of consumer education in regard to the extent of wastage in <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> in the average New Zealand household inhibits this saving from being made. The possible future directions for New Zealand as a result of this study are as follows. - Legislation needs to be put into place in New Zealand to encourage manufacturers to reduce <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> consumption of new appliances. This will help to bring New Zealand manufacturers up to standard with places like the USA, Europe, Australia, Japan and China, who are already taking active steps to reduce <b>standby</b> <b>power.</b> Legislation in other countries has shown that mandatory legislation is hard to police. A campaign educating the consumer on energy labelling and the cost of <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> teamed with a voluntary manufacturers' scheme to lower <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> consumption (using the worldwide energy star label) would be potentially effective. Previous studies have called for a worldwide standardised <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> labelling scheme. This scheme is seen as being necessary as many New Zealand products are being manufactured overseas. The following changes need to take place to take an active approach to reducing <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> wastage: - Research into the standby consumption of the commercial and industrial sectors within New Zealand. - Improvements in energy labelling. Consumer education and awareness campaign with regard to energy labelling, needs to take place on a public arena. Energy labels need to be simplified so the average New Zealander can understand the energy emitted through <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> on market appliances and the amount that <b>standby</b> <b>power</b> costs both on a nation wide scale and to the individual consumer...|$|R
