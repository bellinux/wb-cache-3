DealCenter, LLC was established January 2008 though the online <b>meeting</b> <b>planner</b> has been designed and in use by Jaymie Scotto & Associates as an event planning product since 2005, pre-dating today’s social networking communities. The DealCenter platform is an easy and user-friendly way to see who else is attending or exhibiting an event, to search the list of attendees by relevant information (such as company name, product offering or area served etc.) and then to create one-on-one meetings that will be held on-site at the event. The DealCenter system is traditionally rolled out months before the show date, so attendees can pre-plan their meetings and attend the event with a scheduled timetable of targeted prospect, customer or partner meetings.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{two types}} of {{organizations}} were examined in order to identify the IT adaptation in meetings and convention industry. First, Convention and Visitor Bureaus (CVBs) were studied as an important information brokers and disseminators in the meetings and convention industry. Second, <b>meeting</b> <b>planners</b> were examined as an intermediary between convention attendees and convention suppliers. This study consists of two major parts. The first part is a comparison of CVBs and <b>meeting</b> <b>planners</b> in term of the preference and perception of advertising and communication channels. The second part is to integrate existing theories of technology and organizational IT adaptation in order to examine the proposed framework that describes the influential factors for the Internet usage in the workplace. The {{purpose of the study was}} to examine the relationships between IT adaptation, and organizational characteristics, and compare the perception of advertising and communication channels between CVBs and <b>meeting</b> <b>planners</b> in order to figure out the more comprehensive picture of their marketing communication activities. By employing an on-line survey method, the study proved that findings have met the purpose of study. The results clearly revealed that there are clear channel discrepancy between CVBs and <b>meeting</b> <b>planners</b> in term of preference, attitude, and usage of communication and advertising channels. It was also observed that <b>meeting</b> <b>planners</b> clearly have positive attitude toward the Internet as a communication and marketing tool in the workplace. In regard to the model development, individual factors and organizational factors were considered in order to explain organizational IT adaptation model which is rooted in TAM in IT field. Based on the integration of these two existing factors and one concept (TAM), a model was proposed to describe the interrelationships among the constructs in terms of how each constructs influence intention to use the Internet in the workplace. The result showed that the direction and overall model fit appear to be stable though each direct effect different between the two model. Moreover, the result of confirmatory factor analysis revealed that each variable under the latent construct well support the proposed model. Except job experience, the result illustrated that all constructs are positively related to attitude and intention to use the Internet in the workplace. The strong positive relationship between attitudes and intention was also consistent with the previous IT researches. In all, this study provided more comprehensive marketing and communication channel usage, and an extensive organizational IT adaptation considering the relationship between CVBs and <b>meeting</b> <b>planners.</b> As a result, some valuable marketing insights and recommendations were also provided. ...|$|R
40|$|While {{previous}} research has {{recognized the importance of}} the relationship between <b>meeting</b> <b>planners</b> (MPs) and hotels to the MICE (Meeting, Incentive, Convention and Exhibition) industry, these studies have been primarily conducted in the context of negotiation that highlights the negative aspect of the relationship. Rather than relying on transaction-based exchanges, the present research took a relationship-based exchange approach to examine the relationship from an inter-organizational collaboration perspective. In-depth semi-structured personal interviews were conducted to examine the relationships between MPs and hotels. Collaboration patterns between <b>meeting</b> <b>planners</b> and hotels were identified in three mechanisms: governance, communication and learning. In addition, behavioral manifestations of the three mechanisms by each organization were also explored. Theoretical and managerial implications of the study were also discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Justified {{purpose of}} the topic: Research on crisis {{management}} in the meetings industry only focused {{on the process of}} crisis preparedness and the perception of <b>meeting</b> <b>planners</b> towards crises, with little research carried out on the strategies adopted to manage crisis within the meetings industry. Objective: This paper explores crisis management perceptions and practices by meetings professionals from two perspectives: origins of crisis and crisis management strategies. Methodology: The study adopted an exploratory perspective through interviewing 11 Turkish <b>meeting</b> <b>planners</b> who were asked to revisit past crisis experiences through the critical incident technique. Results: Meetings were shown to be highly prone to smaller scale, operational crisis in particular. Therefore, according to <b>meeting</b> <b>planners,</b> crises are more about service failures than major disruptive events that question the organization’s existence as per the traditional definition of crisis. Crises are classified using a matrix that considers the source of the crisis (internal/external) and the degree of control (controllable/non-controllable). <b>Meeting</b> <b>planners</b> tend to attribute crises events to others than themselves and perceive them as mostly uncontrollable, related third party suppliers (including venues/hotels) and clients. Crisis management strategies employed {{in each of the four}} phases of crisis prevention/preparation, coping, recovery, and learning) were carried out at an individual level, with little formalization at the organizational level evident. Negative perceptions about the need for formalization were reflected in the rejection of developing crisis management plans. Originality: This paper contributes to the literature by demonstrating that crisis management frameworks can be employed to examine crises that are essentially service failures. As a consequence, the distinction between the notions of service failure and crisis may be artificial rather than real. Therefore, researchers planning studies on crises-service failure should consider looking at both literatures in order to integrate both bodies of knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Grid {{cells in}} the entorhinal cortex encode the {{position}} of an animal in its environment using spatially periodic tuning curves of varying periodicity. Recent experiments established that these cells are functionally organized in discrete modules with uniform grid spacing. Here we develop a theory for efficient coding of position, which {{takes into account the}} temporal statistics of the animal's motion. The theory predicts a sharp decrease of module population sizes with grid spacing, in agreement with the trends seen in the experimental data. We identify a simple scheme for readout of the grid cell code by neural circuitry, that can match in accuracy the optimal Bayesian decoder of the spikes. This readout scheme requires persistence over varying timescales, ranging from ~ 1 ms to ~ 1 s, depending on the grid cell module. Our results suggest that the brain employs an efficient representation of position which takes advantage of the spatiotemporal statistics of the encoded variable, in similarity to the principles that govern early sensory coding.

40|$|This study {{outlines}} the communication methods used by meeting planners and suppliers when working together. The study researched communication methods currently being used {{and how the}} communication {{has changed in the}} past five years. The communication methods were broken down into several categories including time, solicitation and relationship development. The study surveyed 240 meeting planners that were all members of Meeting Professionals International. The planners surveyed were selected at random with criteria that included planning meetings in the mountain region. A survey was also submitted to 50 suppliers that were all members of Destination Colorado, an organization comprised of sale people that work in the resort areas of Colorado. The surveys asked questions about the amount of time each professional has to perform his or her job, the best methods of communication with one another, and the value of relationships in the industry. The results indicated that both planners and suppliers have less time to perform their duties than they did five years ago. The most desired method of solicitation for a <b>meeting</b> <b>planner</b> is a personal sales call while the telephone and email have been the best methods for suppliers.

40|$|Spike timing {{dependent}} plasticity (STDP) {{is believed}} {{to play an important}} role in shaping the structure of neural circuits. Here we show that STDP generates effective interactions between synapses of different neurons, which were neglected in previous theoretical treatments, and can be described as a sum over contributions from structural motifs. These interactions can have a pivotal influence on the connectivity patterns that emerge under the influence of STDP. In particular, we consider two highly ordered forms of structure: wide synfire chains, in which groups of neurons project to each other sequentially, and self connected assemblies. We show that high order synaptic interactions can enable the formation of both structures, depending on the form of the STDP function and the time course of synaptic currents. Furthermore, within a certain regime of biophysical parameters, emergence of the ordered connectivity occurs robustly and autonomously in a stochastic network of spiking neurons, without a need to expose the neural network to structured inputs during learning.
