50|$|In {{the above}} example, T's {{children}} are a valid <b>measuring</b> <b>life.</b> T's children are a class, so the class must be closed {{at the time}} of the instrument for T’s children to be valid measuring lives. Here, the class that consists of T's children would be closed {{at the time of}} the instrument as it is impossible for T to have any children after T dies and after the applicable period of gestation. The class that consists of T's grandchildren is not a valid <b>measuring</b> <b>life</b> as T's children are free to reproduce after T dies, meaning the class is not closed {{at the time of the}} instrument.

50|$|Now that we {{know our}} valid {{measuring}} lives, we can see which interests in Blackacre are valid. Obviously, the life estate to T's children is valid as they are the measuring lives. The life estate to T's grandchildren is also valid. Why? Because all of T's grandchildren must be born within 21 years of a <b>measuring</b> <b>life.</b> T's children are our measuring lives, all of T's grandchildren must be born before the last of T's children dies (or, at least be in the womb, which counts as being alive for rule against perpetuities purposes), meaning their interest would vest within 21 years of a <b>measuring</b> <b>life.</b> T's great-grandchildren's interest is invalidated by the rule. Why? Because T's grandchildren are free to reproduce after all of T's children have died. It is possible that one of T's grandchildren could have a child more than 21 years after T's last child dies, meaning the interest might not vest within 21 years of a life in being and thus the gift is to that extent void under the rule.|$|E

The method of determining the charitable deduction is complicated, and is generally stated in Treas. Regs. § 1.664-4(e)(3) and (4). Various factors are taken into consideration, including the adjusted payout rate, the value of the remainder interest, the age of the <b>measuring</b> <b>life</b> (the annuitant), the term of the CRUT, the date of trust creation, and federal interest rates.|$|E

It also arises where the grantor chooses to make the <b>measuring</b> <b>life</b> that of someone other than the life tenant's life. A life {{estate pur autre vie}} is most commonly created in one of two circumstances.|$|E

5000|$|Some states {{follow the}} [...] "wait-and-see approach," [...] or [...] "second look doctrine," [...] and/or apply the [...] "cy pres doctrine."

50|$|Why? The rules {{states that}} any {{interest}} must vest, if at all, within 21 {{years of a}} life in being {{at the time of}} the instrument. The instrument here is a will, so the time of the instrument is T's death, not when the will was drafted. Next, we need to find every possible person, whether named in the instrument or not, who could, regardless how remote the possibility, affect the instrument. T's children, grandchildren etc. are our possible measuring lives because they control who will take Blackacre. For a <b>measuring</b> <b>life</b> to be valid, it must be a life in being {{at the time of the}} interest. For a class, such as children or grandchildren, to be valid measuring lives, it must be a closed class, meaning it must be impossible, not merely highly unlikely, for another class member to come into existence after the time of the instrument.|$|E
5000|$|A {{land owner}} of an estate cannot give a [...] "greater interest" [...] in the estate than he or she owns. That is, a life estate owner cannot give {{complete}} and indefinite ownership (fee simple) to another person because the life tenant's ownership in the property ends when {{the person who is}} the <b>measuring</b> <b>life</b> dies. For instance, if Ashley conveyed to Bob for the life of Bob, and Bob conveys a life estate to another person, Charlie, for Charlie's life embedded life estate, then Charlie's life estate interest would last only until Charlie or Bob dies. Charlie's life interest or pur autre vie interest (interest for the life of another, whichever has applied) and most often the remaining rights of ownership in the property (the 'reversionary interest') devolve to the persons {{under the terms of the}} will/rules of intestacy/declaration of trust/trust deed (UK) or will/rules of intestacy/'grant or deed of life interest' (or similar) (U.S.) in remainder or revert to the original grantee, depending on terms of Ashley. Such a life estate in the U.S. can also be conveyed for the life of the grantor, such as [...] "A conveys X to B until A dies" [...] and in the UK by trust transferring upon trust or assigning rather than conveying X.|$|E

5000|$|The rule {{is often}} stated as follows: “No {{interest}} is good unless it must vest, if at all, {{not later than}} twenty-one years {{after the death of}} some life in being at the creation of the interest.” [...] For the purposes of the rule, a life is [...] "in being" [...] at conception. Although most discussions and analysis relating to the rule revolve around wills and trusts, the rule applies to any future dispositions of property, including options. When a part of a grant or will violates the rule, only that portion of the grant or devise is removed. All other parts that do not violate the rule are still valid. The perpetuities period under the common law rule is not a fixed term of years. By its terms, the rule limits the period to at the latest 21 years after the death of the last identifiable individual living at the time the interest was created ("life in being"). This [...] "measuring" [...] life (often incorrectly called the [...] "validating" [...] life) need not have been a purchaser or taker in the conveyance or devise.

Any one of the [...] "measuring" [...] lives that vindicates the conveyance by resolving all contingencies will be called a [...] "validating" [...] life.

40|$|Aging is a {{degenerative}} process {{characterized by}} a progressive deterioration of cellular components and organelles resulting in mortality. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans {{has emerged as a}} principal model used to study the biology of aging. Because virtually every biological subsystem undergoes functional decline with increasing age, life span is the primary endpoint of interest when considering total rate of aging. In nematodes, life span is typically defined as the number of days an animal remains responsive to external stimuli. Nematodes can be propagated either in liquid media or on solid media in plates, and techniques have been developed for <b>measuring</b> <b>life</b> span under both conditions. Here we present a generalized protocol for <b>measuring</b> <b>life</b> span of nematodes maintained on solid nematode growth media and fed a diet of UV-killed bacteria. These procedures can easily be adapted to assay life span under various common conditions, including a diet consisting of live bacteria, dietary restriction, and RNA interference. Protocol Part 1 : Prepare nematode growth media (NGM) plates This section describes the preparation of the solid NGM plates for use in the life span experiment. A basic life span experiment requires two types of plates: standard NGM plates, which contain no additives, and Amp/FUDR plates, which have both ampicillin (Amp) and fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR) added to the NGM. Ampicillin is used to prevent foreign bacterial contamination. FUDR inhibits cell division, reduces egg production, and prevents eggs from hatching. The use of FUDR for longevity analysis does not affect adult life span and removes the need to transfer worm...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an axiomatic framework for <b>measuring</b> <b>life</b> time poverty over multiple periods. For an individual, {{we argue that}} lifetime poverty is influenced by both the snapshot poverty of each period and the poverty level of the "permanent" lifetime consumption; it is also influenced by how poverty spells are distributed over the life time. Two obvious candidates for aggregation are to aggregate over time and then across individuals, or vice versa. For a society, we consider a path-independence requirement to make these two approaches of aggregation consistent. We axiomatically characterize classes of lifetime poverty indices and derive dominance conditions of poverty orderings for both individual and societal lifetime poverty measurements. Lifetime poverty, snapshot poverty, chronic poverty, poverty measurement. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the psychometric properties of}} the Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ) using an Australian adolescent sample (n = 135).

A convenience sample of 135 high school students aged 12 – 18 years (M = 15. 18 years, SD = 1. 42) completed the questionnaire.
