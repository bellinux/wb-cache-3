40|$|The {{simultaneous}} perturbation of an orthogonal frequency-division <b>multiplexing</b> <b>receiver</b> by {{phase noise}} plus a residual frequency offset (due to synchronization errors) is modeled {{here as a}} combined phase impairment, whose effect is evaluated analytically for {{the case of a}} frequency-selective fading channel. A nonpilot-aided (decision-directed) scheme is proposed, which compensates for the common (over all the subcarriers) phase-impairment effect. By representing the resulting intercarrier interference as an uncorrelated, unequal-variance process in the frequency domain, maximum-likelihood (ML) and approximate ML estimators of the complex-vector and phase-only types are derived and analytically evaluated. The present schemes are also compared with other current methods based on individual phase trackers, one per subcarrier. Finally, two suggestions are introduced for increasing the robustness of the algorithms to tentative-decision errors.

Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2012. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 52 - 55. This {{thesis is}} about design, simulation {{and testing of}} an underwater acoustic modem using OFDM. The thesis work combines a theoretical part, {{whose objective is to}} understand the appropriate techniques to deal with the characteristics of the targeted channel, simulations and a practical part regarding the system deployment and experimental tests. There has been a great growing interest in transmitting real-time data and video. Unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) for military and scientific applications have become important. Building distributed and scalable underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSN) that will bring significant advantages and benefits to underwater applications, such as ocean observation for scientific exploration, commercial exploitation, coastline protection and target detection in military events has been in the scope of researchers. Based on these, designing a concrete system with high data rate will benefit many underwater acoustic (UWA) applications. The existing systems in literature use single carrier transmission and rely on linear or non-linear equalization techniques to suppress inter-symbol interference (ISI), however this requires complex equalizers and results in low data rates. Therefore we concentrate on multicarrier modulation. In this thesis ZP-OFDM (Zero Padded-Orthogonal Frequency Division <b>Multiplexing)</b> <b>receiver</b> is built, where CFO (Carrier Frequency Offset) compensation, pilot-tone based channel estimation, and data demodulation are carried out on the basis of each OFDM block. The implemented OFDM system has been developed in MATLAB. MATLAB scripts generate a data burst that contained OFDM blocks, and then they are transmitted to the hardware from a laptop by using a Data Acquisition (DAQ) Card. At {{the other side of the}} system, the receiver laptop gets the data by using a DAQ Card. As the data is received, MATLAB scripts are demodulated and data is detected. Simulations aim to provide correct implementation of all the algorithms by coupling the generated OFDM signal to a channel using Bellhop underwater channel model and noise addition algorithm, that artificially introduces some of the real channel effects into the signal. The method is tested in a shallow-water experiment at Bilkent Lake. Over a bandwidth of 12 kHz, the data rate is 13. 92 kb/s with QPSK modulation, when the number of subcarriers was 1024. Bit-error-rate (BER) is less than 9 x 10 − 2 without any coding. Yüksel, Mine MerveM. S...|$|E
40|$|The {{constant}} {{growth of}} bandwidth requirements in optical communication networks has prompted the evolution from conventional on-off-keying (OOK) transmission techniques to coherent, polarization multiplexed schemes. The higher spectral efficiency afforded by this approach enables per channel data rates of 100 – 400 Gbps over existing fiber infrastructure. Both the transmitters and receivers benefit from monolithic integration, as it reduces costs and offers rugged performance. A block diagram {{of a coherent}} polarization <b>multiplex</b> <b>receiver</b> is shown in Fig. 1 (a) and basically consists of: i) polarization splitters ii) high performance 90 º hybrids and iii) high speed photodiodes. A first monolithically integrated coherent receiver was presented in [1], which, however, required external polarization management. Integration of the polarization managing elements, such as polarization splitters or polarization rotators, is challenging as they exhibit stringing fabrication tolerances. Here, we will review some recent advances in integrated polarization management. Furthermore, we discuss the design of tunable, fabrication tolerant polarization splitters based on Mach-Zehnder structures as shown in Fig. 1 (b) [2], {{carried out in the}} EU-FP 7 Mirthe project.

The appropriate value of the correlation coefficient is selected by ensuring a close match between the bit error rate results achieved on the proposed correlated channel and those on the measured indoor channel. The authors also experimentally confirm that the performance substantially degrades {{in the presence of}} high values of spatial correlation for a range of spatial <b>multiplexing</b> <b>receivers,</b> and quantify the relationship between this degradation and the value of the spatial correlation coefficient.

40|$|The {{complexities}} of common equalizer schemes are analytically analyzed {{in this paper}} in terms of complex multiplications per bit. Based on this approach we compare the complexity of mode-division multiplexed digital signal processing algorithms with different numbers of multiplexed modes in terms of modal dispersion and distance. It is found that training symbol based equalizers have significantly lower complexity compared to blind approaches for long-haul transmission. Among the training symbol based schemes, OFDM requires the lowest complexity for crosstalk compensation in a mode-division <b>multiplexed</b> <b>receiver.</b> The main challenge for training symbol based schemes is the additional overhead required to compensate modal crosstalk, which increases the data rate. In order to achieve 2000 km transmission, the effective modal dispersion must therefore be below 6 ps/km when the OFDM specific overhead is limited to 10 %. It is concluded that for few mode transmission systems the reduction of modal delay is crucial to enable long-haul performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—While many {{techniques}} {{exist for}} local spectrum sensing {{of a primary}} user, each represents a computationally demanding task to secondary user receivers. In software-defined radio, computational complexity lengthens {{the time for a}} cognitive radio to recognize changes in the transmission environment. This complexity is even more significant for spatially <b>multiplexed</b> <b>receivers,</b> e. g., in SIMO and MIMO, where the spatio-temporal data sets grow in size with the number of antennae. Limits on power and space for the processor hardware further constrain SDR performance. In this report, we discuss improvements in spatio-temporal twice whitening (STTW) for real-time local spectrum sensing by demonstrating a form of STTW well suited for MIMO environments. We implement STTW on the Coherent Logix hx 3100 processor, a multicore processor intended for low-power, high-throughput software-defined signal processing.

30|$|We {{adopt the}} concept of channel diagonalization to time-frequency signal {{expansions}} obtained by DFT filter banks. As a generalization of the frequency domain channel representation used by conventional orthogonal frequency-division <b>multiplexing</b> <b>receivers,</b> the time-frequency domain channel diagonalization {{can be applied to}} time-variant channels and aperiodic signals. An inherent error in the case of doubly dispersive channels can be limited by choosing adequate windows underlying the filter banks. We derive a formula for the mean-squared sample error in the case of wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) channels, which serves as objective function in the window optimization. Furthermore, an enhanced scheme for the parameterization of tight Gabor frames enables us to constrain the window in order to define paraunitary filter banks. We show that the design of windows optimized for WSSUS channels with known statistical properties can be formulated as a convex optimization problem. The performance of the resulting windows is investigated under different channel conditions, for different oversampling factors, and compared against the performance of alternative windows. Finally, a generic matched filter receiver incorporating the proposed channel diagonalization is discussed which may be essential for future reconfigurable radio systems.|$|R

40|$|Despite great potential, non-^ 1 H {{magnetic}} resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI/MRS) studies have not been adopted into standard clinical use. This is largely because the signals generated by non- 1 ^H nuclei have limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to the nuclei?s lower Larmor frequency and lower relative abundance. Exploiting the increased SNR provided by array coils is a natural direction to turn in addressing this; however, it is highly unusual for scanners to be equipped with multi-channel, multi-nuclear receivers due to cost and complexity. This leads to a ?chicken or the egg? conundrum where scanners are not equipped with second-nuclei receivers {{because of the lack}} of any current widespread clinical adoption of second-nuclei studies, but studies are rare because there are not readily available receivers. The application of frequency domain multiplexing (FDM) to MRI has been investigated as a low cost alternative to expensive multi-channel receivers, and has been applied to non-^ 1 H nuclei.

Once acquisition is over, the circuit switches to a decision-directed mode to perform fine frequency tracking for reliable data demodulation. The algorithm performance is analyzed in terms of width of the lock-in frequency range and of lock-in probability in the acquisition mode, and of mean-square frequency estimation error in the tracking mode.
