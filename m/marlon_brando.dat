5|$|The Wachowskis asked Joe Pantoliano {{to watch}} John Huston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and {{to focus on}} Humphrey Bogart's {{character}} in order to prepare the paranoia of Caesar. Gershon's influences for her role were James Dean, <b>Marlon</b> <b>Brando</b> and Clint Eastwood. Both Gershon and Tilly were nervous about filming the sex scenes and prepared by drinking tequila.|$|E
5|$|The film {{received}} seven Golden Raspberry nominations and won six. The only category {{the film}} lost was Worst Supporting Actor for Burt Reynolds, which went to <b>Marlon</b> <b>Brando</b> for The Island of Dr. Moreau.

5|$|In 1953 Gielgud {{made his}} first Hollywood film, the sole {{classical}} actor in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's Julius Caesar, playing Cassius. <b>Marlon</b> <b>Brando</b> (Mark Antony) was in awe of him, and James Mason (Brutus) was disheartened at Gielgud's seemingly effortless skill. Gielgud, for his part, felt he learned much about film technique from Mason. Gielgud enjoyed his four-month stay in California, not least, as Morley comments, for the relaxed attitude there to homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Coppola began {{development}} of a film based {{on the life of}} Tucker, originally with <b>Marlon</b> <b>Brando</b> in the lead role. Starting in 1976, Coppola planned Tucker to be both a musical and an experimental film with music and lyrics written by Leonard Bernstein, Betty Comden and Adolph Green. The project eventually collapsed when Coppola's American Zoetrope experienced financial problems. Tucker was revived in 1986 when Coppola's friend, George Lucas, joined as a producer.|$|E

5|$|<b>Marlon</b> <b>Brando</b> as Jor-El: Superman's {{biological}} father on Krypton. He has {{a theory about}} the planet exploding, yet the Council refuses to listen. He dies as the planet explodes but successfully sends his infant son to Earth {{as a means to}} help the innocent. Brando sued the Salkinds and Warner Bros. for $50million because he felt cheated out of his share of the box office profits. This stopped Brando's footage from being used in Richard Lester's version of Superman II.|$|E
5|$|Gary {{uses the}} novel {{as a vehicle to}} {{denounce}} both racism and the activists supporting African-American rights, including his own ex-wife and <b>Marlon</b> <b>Brando.</b> He also examines whether human responses to situations, including racism, are learned social behavior and whether they can be unlearned. In 1981, it was adapted into the controversial film of the same name, in which director Samuel Fuller made various changes to the novel's story to focus more on the dog and present a more pessimistic ending than the original novel. The film's American release after negative press from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) led to concerns of boycotts.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{producer}} Ilya Salkind {{convinced his}} father Alexander {{to buy the}} rights to Superman. They hired Mario Puzo to pen a two-film script, and negotiated with Steven Spielberg to direct, though Alexander Salkind rejected him as Jaws went over budget. <b>Marlon</b> <b>Brando</b> and Gene Hackman signed on to play Jor-El and Lex Luthor respectively, and Guy Hamilton was hired to direct. However, Brando was faced with an obscenity lawsuit in Italy over Last Tango in Paris, and Hamilton was unable to shoot in England as he had violated his tax payments. The Salkinds hired Richard Donner to direct the film. Donner hired Tom Mankiewicz to polish the script, giving it a serious feel with Christ-like overtones.|$|E

5|$|Laurence Olivier, {{who died}} in 1989, posthumously appears as the villain and mad {{scientist}} Dr. Totenkopf. His likeness was produced using digitally manipulated archival BBC footage of the actor and thus adding one more film to his repertoire. A similar move was made two years later in Superman Returns (2006) with <b>Marlon</b> <b>Brando.</b> Avnet cultivated a calculated release for the movie by first moving its release date from the summer (it was supposed to open a week before Spider-Man 2 (2004)) to September, then courting the Internet press and finally making an appearance at the San Diego Comic Con with key cast members {{in an attempt to}} generate some advance buzz.|$|E
5|$|Several {{actors were}} offered {{the role of}} Judah Ben-Hur before it was {{accepted}} by Charlton Heston. Burt Lancaster stated he turned down the role because he found the script boring and belittling to Christianity. Paul Newman turned it down because he said he didn't have the legs to wear a tunic. <b>Marlon</b> <b>Brando,</b> Rock Hudson, Geoffrey Horne, and Leslie Nielsen were also offered the role, as {{were a number of}} muscular, handsome Italian actors (many of whom did not speak English). Kirk Douglas was interested in the role, but was turned down in favor of Heston, who was formally cast on January 22, 1958. His salary was $250,000 for 30 weeks, a prorated salary for any time over 30 weeks, and travel expenses for his family.|$|E
5|$|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) {{originally}} {{announced a}} remake of the 1925 silent film Ben-Hur in December 1952, ostensibly {{as a way to}} spend its Italian assets. Stewart Granger and Robert Taylor were reported to be in the running for the lead. Nine months later, MGM announced it would make the film in CinemaScope, with shooting beginning in 1954. In November 1953, MGM announced it had assigned producer Sam Zimbalist to the picture and hired screenwriter Karl Tunberg to write it. Sidney Franklin was scheduled to direct, with <b>Marlon</b> <b>Brando</b> intended for the lead. In September 1955, Zimbalist, who continued to claim that Tunberg's script was complete, announced that a $7 million, six-to-seven month production would begin in April 1956 in either Israel or Egypt in MGM's new 65mm widescreen process, MGM Camera 65. MGM, however, suspended production in early 1956, following Franklin's resignation.|$|E

5|$|Kubrick {{was raised}} in the Bronx, New York City, and {{attended}} William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945. Although he only received average grades, Kubrick displayed a keen interest in literature, photography, and film from a young age, and taught himself all aspects of film production and directing after graduating from high school. After working as a photographer for Look magazine in the late 1940s and early 1950s, he began making short films on a shoestring budget, and made his first major Hollywood film, The Killing, for United Artists in 1956. This was followed by two collaborations with Kirk Douglas, the war picture Paths of Glory (1957) and the historical epic Spartacus (1960). His reputation as a filmmaker in Hollywood grew, and he was approached by <b>Marlon</b> <b>Brando</b> to film what would become One-Eyed Jacks (1961), though Brando eventually decided to direct it himself.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{publication}} of his memoirs, Chaplin began work on A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), a romantic comedy based on a script he had written for Paulette Goddard in the 1930s. Set on an ocean liner, it starred <b>Marlon</b> <b>Brando</b> as an American ambassador and Sophia Loren as a stowaway found in his cabin. The film differed from Chaplin's earlier productions in several aspects. It was his first to use Technicolor and the widescreen format, while he concentrated on directing and appeared on-screen only in a cameo role as a seasick steward. He also signed a deal with Universal Pictures and appointed his assistant, Jerome Epstein, as the producer. Chaplin was paid $600,000 director's fee as well {{as a percentage of the}} gross receipts. A Countess from Hong Kong premiered in January 1967, to unfavourable reviews, and was a box-office failure. Chaplin was deeply hurt by the negative reaction to the film, which turned out to be his last.|$|E
5|$|Steiger {{made his}} stage debut in a {{production}} of Curse you, Jack Dalton! (1946) at the Civic Repertory Theatre of Newark. Subsequent to this, he received an invitation {{from one of his}} teachers, Daniel Mann, to attend the Actors Studio, established by Elia Kazan in October 1947. It was here, along with <b>Marlon</b> <b>Brando,</b> Karl Malden and Eli Wallach, that he studied method acting, which became deeply engrained in him. Lacking matinée idol looks, much like Malden and Wallach, he began pursuing a career as a character actor rather than as a leading man. Steiger's stage work continued in 1950, with a minor role as a townperson in a stage production of An Enemy of the People at the Music Box Theatre. His first major role on Broadway came in Clifford Odets's production of Night Music (1951), where he played A. L. Rosenberger. The play was held at the ANTA Playhouse. The following year, he played a telegraphist in the play Seagulls Over Sorrento, performed at the John Golden Theatre beginning on September 11, 1952.|$|E
