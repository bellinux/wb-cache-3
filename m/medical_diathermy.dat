5000|$|О терапевтичском применении коротких волн (On the Therapeutic Use of Short Waves). With M.A. Borodina, V.M. Linchenko, and M.M. Orlov. Sevastopol: Sechenov Institute, 1936. This {{book was}} in fact the first {{fundamental}} guide on the use of short waves in <b>medical</b> <b>diathermy</b> [...] and received very positive reviews in several academic journals,.|$|E
50|$|KALW's {{original}} transmitter was {{a modified}} GE <b>medical</b> <b>diathermy</b> machine. While the original transmitter {{had not been}} used since the switch to the modern FM band in the late 1940s, it was still located at John O'Connell Technical High School until the school was demolished in the mid-1990s. The station's current transmitter tower is on Twin Peaks.|$|E
50|$|Shigeru Nakajima at Japan Radio Company (JRC) saw a {{commercial}} potential {{of these devices}} and began the further development and subsequent very profitable production of magnetrons for the <b>medical</b> dielectric heating (<b>diathermy)</b> market. The only military interest in magnetrons was shown by Yoji Ito at the Naval Technical Research Institute (NTRI).|$|R
50|$|Shigeru Nakajima, {{a younger}} brother of Yoji Ito and a {{scientist}} at the Japan Radio Company (JRC), was also investigating magnetrons, primarily for the <b>medical</b> dielectric heating (<b>diathermy)</b> market. An alliance was made between NTRI and JRC for further magnetron development. In early 1939, led by Yoji Ito they built a 10-cm (3-GHz), stable-frequency Mandarin-type magnetron (No. M3) that, with water cooling, could produce 500-W power.|$|R
5000|$|The {{exploitation}} of high-frequency radio waves for heating substances {{was made possible}} by the development of vacuum tube radio transmitters around 1920. By 1930 the application of short waves to heat human tissue had developed into the <b>medical</b> therapy of <b>diathermy.</b> At the 1933 Chicago World's Fair, Westinghouse demonstrated the cooking of foods between two metal plates attached to a 10 kW, 60 MHz shortwave transmitter. [...] The Westinghouse team, led by I. F. Mouromtseff, found that foods like steaks and potatoes could be cooked in minutes.|$|R
5000|$|Efforts {{to block}} the Knickebein {{headache}} were codenamed [...] "Aspirin". Initially, modified <b>medical</b> <b>diathermy</b> sets transmitted interference, but later, on nights where raids were expected, local radio transmitters broadcast an extra [...] "dot signal" [...] at low power. The German practice of turning on the beams long before the bombers reached the target area aided the British efforts. Avro Ansons fitted with receivers would be flown {{around the country in}} an attempt to capture the beams' location; a successful capture would then be reported to nearby broadcasters.|$|E
50|$|The industrial, {{scientific}} and medical (ISM) radio bands are radio bands (portions {{of the radio}} spectrum) reserved internationally {{for the use of}} radio frequency (RF) energy for industrial, {{scientific and}} medical purposes other than telecommunications. Examples of applications in these bands include radio-frequency process heating, microwave ovens, and <b>medical</b> <b>diathermy</b> machines. The powerful emissions of these devices can create electromagnetic interference and disrupt radio communication using the same frequency, so these devices were limited to certain bands of frequencies. In general, communications equipment operating in these bands must tolerate any interference generated by ISM applications, and users have no regulatory protection from ISM device operation.|$|E
50|$|Microwaves {{travel by}} line-of-sight; unlike lower {{frequency}} radio waves {{they do not}} diffract around hills, follow the earth's surface as ground waves, or reflect from the ionosphere, so terrestrial microwave communication links are limited by the visual horizon to about 40 miles (64 km). At {{the high end of}} the band they are absorbed by gases in the atmosphere, limiting practical communication distances to around a kilometer. Microwaves are extremely widely used in modern technology. They are used for point-to-point communication links, wireless networks, microwave radio relay networks, radar, satellite and spacecraft communication, <b>medical</b> <b>diathermy</b> and cancer treatment, remote sensing, radio astronomy, particle accelerators, spectroscopy, industrial heating, collision avoidance systems, garage door openers and keyless entry systems, and for cooking food in microwave ovens.|$|E
50|$|The S band is a {{designation}} by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for {{a part of}} {{the microwave}} band of the electromagnetic spectrum covering frequencies from 2 to 4 gigahertz (GHz). Thus it crosses the conventional boundary between the UHF and SHF bands at 3.0 GHz. The S band is used by weather radar, surface ship radar, and some communications satellites, especially those used by NASA to communicate with the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. The 10 cm radar short-band ranges roughly from 1.55 to 5.2 GHz. The S band also contains the 2.4-2.483 GHz ISM band, widely used for low power unlicensed microwave devices such as cordless phones, wireless headphones (Bluetooth), wireless networking (WiFi), garage door openers, keyless vehicle locks, baby monitors as well as for <b>medical</b> <b>diathermy</b> machines and microwave ovens (typically at 2.495GHz).|$|E
40|$|The {{occupational}} {{environment is}} one domain in which humans {{are exposed to}} RF radiation. Many occupational circumstances entail regular or occasional exposure to RF radiation from fixed or mobile sources. A wide variety of workers are involved, including military and security personnel using walkie-talkie devices, radar operators, radio and television antenna mainte-nance and repair workers, welders performing dielectric (high-frequency) welding and sealing of plastics, workers using RF radiation for drying or testing operations, and physiotherapists employing <b>medical</b> <b>diathermy</b> equipment. Only {{a limited number of}} studies have assessed the risk of cancer in relation to either measure...|$|E
40|$|The case {{histories}} of two individuals exposed to thermal radiation emitted from an electric oven and range were presented. In one patient, earlier exposure to <b>medical</b> <b>diathermy</b> {{appears to have}} initiated delayed or late-appearing, capsular cataracts. Instead of the anticipated slow progression, the cataractogenesis was accelerated following recent, repeated exposure to the intense, infrared radiation. In the other patient, exposed solely to infrared radiation, a chorioretinal lesion indistinguishable from the type characteristically secondary to repeated, thermal radiation was observed. More recently, the earliest sign of thermal radiation cataractogenesis, capsular opacification, has become evident. The widespread availability of radiant energy sources such as diathermy machines, microwave ovens, and electric ovens and ranges makes it imperative to examine carefully any possible hazards that may result from their use. With this in mind, radiant energy {{should be considered in}} the differential diagnosis of cataractogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Fine {{control of}} {{microwave}} power radiation in medical and scientific applications is a challenging task. Since a commercial Continuous Wave (CW) magnetron {{is the most}} inexpensive microwave device available today on the market, it becomes the best candidate for a microwave power generator used in <b>medical</b> <b>diathermy</b> and hyperthermia treatments or high efficiency chemical reactions using microwave reactors as well. This article presents a new method for driving a CW magnetron with short pulses, using a modified commercial Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) inverter, software driven by a custom embedded system. The microwave power generator designed with this method can be programmed for output microwave pulses down to 1 % of the magnetron's power and allows microwave low frequency pulse modulation {{in the range of}} human brain electrical activity, intended for medical applications. Microwave output power continuous control is also possible with the magnetron running in the oscillating area, using a dual frequency Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), where the low frequency PWM pulse is modulating a higher resonant frequency required by the ZVS inverter's transformer. The method presented allows a continuous control of both power and energy (duty-cycle) at the inverter's output...|$|E
