40|$|Exposure of {{previously}} isolated anoestrous ewes to a ram induces an almost instantaneous rise in luteinising hormone (LH) pulse frequency. This physiological response, a phenomenon coined 'the ram effect' is commonly sufficient {{to override the}} seasonal suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and induce a synchronous first ovulation. The objective of the first series of experiments in this thesis {{was to develop a}} nonpharmacological method of oestrus synchronisation, using socio-sexual cues, for natural mating of mule ewes during the breeding season. Initially two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of short-term fence line and vasectomised ram exposure repeated every 17 days on three occasions during the transition into the breeding season. Ewes repeatedly exposed to the ram had a significantly compacted mating period compared to ewes maintained in isolation from rams prior to mating. This compaction persisted through to lambing with no significant negative effect on litter size. Artificially inseminated ewes synchronised using the above method of ram synchronisation had higher conception rates than progestagen synchronised ewes. The second objective was to compare the efficacy of different durations and frequencies of ram exposures as methods of oestrus synchronisation. Ewes maintained continuously with rams over the pre-mating period had a more compacted mating and lambing period than ewes exposed intermittently to rams. <b>Maiden</b> <b>ewes</b> typically show a poorer level of reproductive competence than adult <b>ewes.</b> Similarly <b>maiden</b> <b>ewes</b> induced to ovulate using the ram effect have been found to have a lower ovulatory response. The next objective of this thesis was to determine if pre-exposure to the ram during anoestrus or the breeding season would modulate the hormonal and behavioural responses of <b>maiden</b> <b>ewes</b> when re-introduced to rams during the breeding season or anoestrus. There was no major effect of prior experience of the ram on any parameters of the LH response to ram introduction. However ewes with prior ram experience did have more positive interactions with the rams and demonstrated more ram seeking behaviour. Incorporation of socio-sexual cues with artificial methods of reproductive control has to date been restricted to ram exposure post progestagen sponge withdrawal. Therefore the final objective of this thesis was to investigate the effect of ram exposure towards the end of a progestagen synchronisation protocol on ewe fertility. There {{was no significant difference in}} conception rates between ram exposed and control ewes, however ram exposed ewes had a significant depression in mean litter size due to a greater number of ewes having single lambs. The studies in this thesis show a robust and repeatable endocrine response to ram introduction in mule ewes exposed to the ram during the transition between anoestrus and the breeding season. The potency of the socio-sexual cues from the ram permits modification of the distribution of oestrus within randomly cycling ewes. The findings in this thesis highlight the potential for application and development of pre-mating strategies using socio-sexual cues within seasonal breeds of sheep.

40|$|In the Netherlands, {{separate}} {{activities of}} FSH and ICSH in the pituitary, morphological changes in ovaries and vaginal smears {{were examined in}} Texel ewes during the oestrus cycle. Both FSH and ICSH content of the pituitary decreased very sharply in late dioestrus. Immediately after ovulation, FSH content increased again but ICSH not {{before the end of}} luteinisation. Times of oestrus in Dorper sheep, (a non-wool mutton breed) and in the Merino (with good quality wool) were determined during grazing on mixed Karroo veld in South Africa. The relation between age or Reece type and oestrus was studied in the Dorper. <b>Maiden</b> <b>ewes</b> had a limited breeding season. Mature ewes, especially those of intermediate fleece type, exhibited oestrus throughout the year. Merino sheep had a limited breeding season as judged by oestrus and by ovarian morphology. The difference in length of breeding season between Dorper and Merino sheep seemed to be of great practical importance...|$|R

The aim {{was to investigate the}} effects of BW and BCS at mating, age group, and breed on reproductive traits. 1759 Merino, Composite Merino/Coopworth (M/Coop), Composite East Friesian/Romney (EF/Rom), and Composite Coopworth/East Friesian/Texel (Coop/EF/Tex) <b>ewes</b> of <b>maiden</b> (7 mo) and mature (18 to 30 mo) age groups were evaluated. Body weight and BCS of ewes were recorded before rams were introduced to the breeding mob. Ultrasound scanning 90 d after ram removal was carried out. Results demonstrated that ewes that conceived were consistently of greater BW and BCS than barren ewes. The average BW of non-pregnant, single, and multiple-bearing ewes were 41. 3, 43. 7, and 54. 6 kg respectively, while their corresponding BCS were 2. 77, 2. 80, and 2. 85. However, highly signicant (P < 0. 0001) breed, age group, and ock variations were observed: 7 mo-old <b>maiden</b> <b>ewes</b> had a significantly lower conception rate than 18 mo-old ewes at the same BW at breeding.

40|$|Dorper (DO) is a meat-specialized hair {{composite}} breed, intensively {{selected for}} growth rates, carcass quality, unselective grazing. The {{aim of the}} current comparative study was to evaluate the adaptability and performance of DO breed under Hungarian and Romanian rearing conditions. DO breed was introduced into Hungary to Debrecen University in 2008. Under Hungarian rearing conditions the DO breed maintained its non-seasonal reproduction and reproductive precocity, with <b>maiden</b> <b>ewes</b> being put to ram starting the age of 9 months. Lamb crops of 2 weaned per year are common under proper management and feeding conditions. In Romania DO breed was introduced starting 2007, with the heard-book and genetic improvement plan of the breed being established in 2009. Under Romanian farming conditions the DO rams are usually used as terminal sires which are crossed with indigenous Turcana and Tsigai breeds, being preferred by the farmers to sire the crossbreds {{because of the high}} growth rates and non-selective grazing of the crossbreds. Fertility of DO ewes and survival rates of the DO sired lambs until weaning were not affected when compared to native Turcana breed. It was concluded that DO breed has adapted and performs extremely well under both Hungarian and Romanian rearing conditions. </p...|$|R
40|$|The study {{describes}} two trials on {{artificial insemination}} in Romney ewes. Trial 1 {{was conducted to}} examine the anatomical site in the reproductive tract of the inseminating needle after transcervical insemination, and to evaluate {{the effect of the}} needle in causing cervical tissue damage based on the microscopic assessment of cervical slides. Trial 2 was undertaken to compare the effect of intrauterine, cervical or transcervical methods of insemination with fresh semen on fertility. Two hundred and five mixed-aged ewes (3 - 8 years old) were hormonally treated with CIDR-G for 12 days and these were removed after this period. Forty-eight hours later, to monitor the onset of oestrus, they were joined with 10 harnessed vasectomised rams. Oestrous detection was undertaken twice daily, at 1. 00 am and 1. 00 pm. Most ewes were synchronised in oestrus over 2 days after CIDR withdrawal but there was an extended period of 'second' oestrus when the inseminations were conducted. In Trial 1, transcervical insemination with Indian ink was performed in 29 ewes at the second oestrus, and then they were euthanased with Sodium Pentobarbitone. Position of the inseminating needle in situ was determined at dissection. The genital tract was removed and the uterus opened to determine whether Indian ink had penetrated. The cervix was then split into three similar sized portions, fixed in Bouins solution, and sections histologically processed and stained for slides. The slides were microscopically examined by two evaluators to determine damage scores. In trial 2, semen samples (concentration at least 3 x 109 spermatozoa ml- 1, motility minimal 4) were collected per artificial vagina from 5 Romney rams, pooled and freshly diluted with UHT-milk to 8 x 108 spermatozoa ml- 1. One hundred and seventy-five cyclic ewes were randomly assigned to either of three AI techniques (intrauterine, cervical and transcervical), and were inseminated with freshly diluted semen at a mean interval of 6. 1 0. 26 h after second oestrus was detected. In slaughtered ewes, penetration of the modified needle through the lumen of the cervix and even into the uterus occurred more that with the unmodified needle (90 % vs 68 %; 0. 05 <P< 0. 1). Both types of needle used caused damage in the genital tract, and even caused rupture through the wall of the cervix. This was less frequent with the modified needle and therefore it was used for transcervical insemination in Trial 2. The predicted location of the needle in the tract and its actual location were highly correlated. In Trial 2, the overall mean for the conception rate to AI was 82 %, but no differences were noted between methods of inseminations. With lambing rate, transcervical inseminations gave the best results, but there were no differences in the litter size between methods. For transcervical insemination depth of penetration of the needle had an effect on conception rate and lambing rate (P< 0. 05) and thus the method should aim to place the semen well into and even through the cervix. The results for transcervical insemination were not affected by the interval from oestrous detection to insemination, or the age of the ewes or whether the inseminations were conducted in the morning or afternoon. The technique was more difficult to accomplish in <b>maiden</b> than older <b>ewes.</b> It was concluded that while transcervical insemination with freshly diluted semen gave a satisfactory result, it is not always suitable for <b>maiden</b> <b>ewes</b> and others, where difficulty is encountered in penetrating through the cervix. Further work to evaluate the technique with larger numbers of ewes is required...|$|R
40|$|Smithburn (1949) {{reported}} that humoral immunity to Rift Valley fever (R. V. F.), transmitted from an immune ewe to her twin lambs, persisted {{for about five}} months and was not affected by weaning. He postulated {{that this might be}} of practical value in protecting young lambs during the period of maximum susceptibility to Rift Valley Fever virus. In the Republic of South Africa, arthropod-borne diseases of sheep such as Rift Valley fever, Wesselsbron disease and bluetongue occur seasonally during the late summer and autumn, and almost invariably disappear soon after the first frosts of winter. Bearing this in mind, practical use is made of transmitted passive immunity to protect the lambs. Autumn lambing is advocated, and farmers are advised to immunise all their sheep during the spring, first with a polyvalent bluetongue vaccine and later with a combined Rift Valley fever-Wesselsbron vaccine. On account of the abortifacient and embryotropic properties of the neuroadapted Rift Valley fever and Wesselsbron disease viruses which form the basis of the live attenuated virus vaccine, prophylactic immunisation is restricted to non-pregnant animals. At present, for the preparation of the Rift Valley fever vaccine, Smithburn's neurotropic attenuated strain of virus at the 102 nd mouse intracerebral passage level is used. Mulligan (1937) prepared a similar type of vaccine from a neurotropic strain of virus at the 92 nd mouse passage level. He {{reported that}} “the vaccine proved safe for lambs six weeks old and produced a good immunity. Tested in the field, on a large number of pregnant ewes and newly born lambs, this vaccine was found to be unsafe for the newly born lambs and to cause abortion in some of the pregnant ewes. Vaccination of pregnant ewes, moreover, did not appear to result in the transfer of the immune bodies through the colostrum to the lamb although, in this connection, it must be stated that lambing had started at the time vaccination was practised and the interval between inoculation and the birth of a lamb was never more than a few days. It became apparent, however, that the vaccine, while it might be of service in protecting <b>maiden</b> <b>ewes,</b> was not suitable for controlling an outbreak in pregnant ewes and very young lambs. " Kaschula (1953) using Smithburn's neurotropic virus at the 86 th passage level reported abortions among pregnant ewes and the death of lambs shortly after birth under field conditions in South Africa. The investigations reported in this communication were undertaken initially to determine the effect of the strain of Rift Valley fever virus incorporated in the vaccine on pregnant ewes and day-old lambs. During the course of the investigations valuable information was obtained on the nature and duration of transmitted immunity in lambs and the immune response of day-old lambs to the neurotropic strain of Rift Valley fever virus.

40|$|An {{option to}} {{increase}} the productivity of saline land is to graze sheep on salt-tolerant plants, which, during the summer/autumn period, can contain 20 % to 25 % of their dry matter as salt. This study assessed the impact of coping with high dietary salt loads on the reproductive performance of grazing ewes. From the time of artificial insemination until parturition, 2 -year-old <b>maiden</b> Merino <b>ewes</b> were fed either a high-salt diet (NaCl 13 % of dry matter) or control diet (NaCl 0. 5 % of dry matter). Pregnancy rates, lamb birth weights, milk composition and the plasma concentrations of hormones related to salt and water balance, and energy metabolism were measured. Leptin and insulin concentrations were lower (1. 4 ± 0. 09 v. 1. 5 ± 0. 12 ng/ml; (P < 0. 05) and 7. 2 ± 0. 55 v. 8. 2 ± 0. 83 ng/ml; P < 0. 02) in response to high-salt ingestion as was aldosterone concentration (27 ± 2. 7 v. 49 ± 5. 4 pg/ml; P < 0. 05), presumably to achieve salt and water homeostasis. Arginine vasopressin concentration was not significantly affected by the diets, but plasma concentration of T 3 differed during gestation (P < 0. 02), resulting in lower concentrations in the high-salt group in the first third of gestation (1. 2 ± 0. 18 v. 1. 3 ± 0. 14 pmol/ml) and higher concentrations in the final third of gestation (0. 8 ± 0. 16 v. 0. 6 ± 0. 06 pmol/ml). T 4 concentration was lower in ewes ingesting high salt for the first two-thirds of pregnancy (162 ± 8. 6 v. 212 ± 13 ng/ml; P < 0. 001). No substantial effects of high salt ingestion on pregnancy rates, lamb birth weights or milk composition were detected. S. N. Digby, D. G. Masters, D. Blache, M. A. Blackberry, P. I. Hynd and D. K.

40|$|Much {{research}} {{has gone into}} developing a sustainable management tool for haemonchosis, namely the FAMACHA© system, which has been validated by numerous studies worldwide. However, the financial implications on production of implementing this system have not been fully investigated in sheep previously. A trial was conducted on a farm comprising a flock of approximately 300 Mutton Merinos on which the FAMACHA© system was in use. Seventy five <b>maiden</b> and multiparous <b>ewes</b> were randomly allocated to the following three trial groups: (i) FAMACHA© in which ewes judged to be incategories 4 or 5 were dosed with levamisole HCl 2, 5 % (Nemasol NF, Intervet); (ii) Conventionally dosed in which all ewes were dosed every six weeks with levamisole HCl 2, 5 % (Nemasol NF, Intervet); (iii) Suppressively dosed in which all ewes were injected every six weeks with moxydectin 1 % m/v (Cydectin, Bayer AH). There {{were no significant differences}} in body weight gains, FAMACHA© and body condition scores amongst the three treatment regimens for ewes that did not conceive. For those that became pregnant during the trial there was a significant difference when analysed by calendar date but not when analysed by reproductive stage. There were also no significant differences between trial groups in lamb birth weight and, after slow growers had been sold, the average daily gain of the lambs born to ewes in the trial. The cost of anthelmintics was considerably lower for the FAMACHA© group. In conclusion there {{were no significant differences in}} selected production parameters when using the FAMACHA© system as opposed to other methods of anthelmintic use in a Mutton Merino flock in a semi-intensive farming system and that the gestation status should be taken into account when measuring these parameters in future studies.

40|$|Dois experimentos foram realizados na fazenda da Universidade de Western Australia, em Perth, Austrália, com o objetivo de estudar o temperamento de ovelhas Merino em resposta ao efeito macho. No primeiro, foram utilizadas 30 fêmeas (15 calmas e 15 nervosas), tendo como parâmetro de avaliação as prováveis mudanças no perfil de secreção de LH (Hormônio Luteinizante). Um outro grupo de 30 ovelhas, eqüitativamente distribuído de acordo com o temperamento (15 calmas e 15 nervosas) foi estudado para se avaliar a resposta ao efeito macho, através da análise do perfil de produção de progesterona. Os resultados mostraram que as ovelhas calmas exibiram uma maior resposta ao efeito macho (P 0, 05) quanto à distribuição dos estros semanais identificados pelos carneiros com marcadores, nem com relação ao porcentual de prenhez detectada por ultra-sonografia (P> 0, 05). O terceiro experimento foi executado no campo {{experimental}} da Embrapa Tabuleiros Costeiros, em Sergipe. Foram utilizadas ovelhas Santa Inês de três diferentes categorias, pós-parto (G 1), ovelhas jovens (G 2) e solteiras (G 3) que foram expostas ao efeito macho com o uso de rufiões, durante 45 dias. As fêmeas no pós-parto apresentaram uma resposta ao efeito macho próxima daquela observada em ovelhas no anestro estacional, concentrando o primeiro estro entre o 17 e o 25 dia após a exposição aos rufiões. Enquanto as ovelhas jovens e ovelhas solteiras exibiram uma distribuição do primeiro estro aleatória e concentrada nos primeiros 18 dias após a introdução dos machos. Esses resultados confirmam a eficiência do efeito macho em fêmeas em anestro, assim como indicam que animais de temperamento calmo apresentaram uma maior resposta a esta bioestimulação. Two {{experiments were}} carried out at the farm of University of Western Australia, in Perth, Australia, {{with the objective of}} studying the temperament of Merino ewes in response to male effect. In the first one, 30 females were utilized (15 calm and 15 nervous), having as probable parameters of evaluation the changes in the secretion profile of LH. Another group of 30 ewes was also equally distributed according to the temperament (15 calms and 15 nervous) and was studied to evaluate the response to male effect through the analysis of the profile of progesterone production. The results showed that calm ewes exhibited a higher response to male effect (P 0, 05) related to weekly estrus distribution identified by the rams (P> 0, 05) neither in relation to the percentage of pregnancy detected by real time ultrasound (P> 0, 05). The experiment was done in the experimental farm of Embrapa Tabuleiros Costeiros, in Sergipe State. Santa Inês ewes were utilized from three different categories: post-partum (G 1), maiden (G 2) and single ewes (G 3) which were exposed to male effect through the use of teasers for 45 days. Post-partum females showed a response to male effect similar to that observed in ewes during the season anoestrus, with the concentration of first estrus between Day 17 and 25 after teasers exhibition. On the other hand, <b>maiden</b> and single <b>ewes</b> presented a random estrus distribution concentrated in the first 18 days after the introduction of males.
