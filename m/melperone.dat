Olanzapine also had the highest affinity of any second-generation antipsychotic towards the P-glycoprotein in one in vitro study. P-glycoprotein transports a myriad of drugs across a numerous of different biological membranes (found in numerous body systems) including the blood-brain barrier (a semi-permeable membrane which filters the contents of blood prior to it reaching the brain); P-GP inhibition could mean that less brain exposure to olanzapine results from this interaction with the P-glycoprotein. A relatively large quantity of commonly encountered foods and medications inhibit P-GP, and it is fairly common for pharmaceuticals to be either substrates of P-GP, or to inhibit its action; both substrates and inhibitors of P-GP effectively increase the permeability of the blood brain barrier to P-GP substrates and subsequently increase the central activity of the substrate while reducing the local effects on the GI tract. The mediation of olanzapine in {{the central nervous system}} by P-GP means that any other substance or drug which interacts with P-GP increases the risk for toxic accumulations of both olanzapine and the other drug.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Clozapine is the {{treatment}} of choice in refractory schizophrenia, but a substantial proportion of patients experience inadequate response or tolerate the drug poorly. <b>Melperone</b> has been suggested as a possible alternative in such patients. This case series examines the efficacy of <b>melperone</b> in refractory schizophrenia. Method: All patients prescribed <b>melperone</b> at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust were identified using a pharmacy database. The main outcome {{was to determine the}} proportion of patients discharged on <b>melperone.</b> Results: Three of 21 patients were discharged on <b>melperone.</b> The primary reason for dis-continuation was lack of efficacy. Conclusion: <b>Melperone</b> may be an option in a very few patients with refractory schizophrenia, but it should not be considered as an alternative to clozapine...|$|E

40|$|In vitro {{preparations}} of rabbit heart {{were made}} from which measurements of effective refractory period (ERP), atrio-Hisian (A-H) and His-Purkinje (H-P) conduction times could be obtained, analogous to electrophysiological measurements customarily carried out in vivo. Intracellular potentials also were recorded from the sino-atrial (SA) node, atrium, bundle of His, preterminal Purkinje fibres and papillary muscles. The effects {{of a range of}} concentrations of three new antiarrhythmic drugs, <b>melperone,</b> cibenzoline and alinidine were compared, the lower concentrations studied corresponding to clinical levels. At low concentrations the effects of <b>melperone,</b> inducing bradycardia and lengthening ERP, could be attributed to prolongation of action potential duration (APD) in the sinus node and atrial and ventricular tissues. The slope of slow diastolic depolarization was not altered, nor was there any change in A-H or H-P conduction time, or in maximum rate of depolarization (MRD). At higher concentrations <b>melperone</b> had a substantial class 1 action, but there was no negative inotropic effect, or other evidence of restriction of slow inward current. Cibenzoline was primarily a class 1 agent but also lengthened APD to some extent in the SA node and in atrial and ventricular muscle, but not in Purkinje fibres. APD thus became more uniform along the ventricular conducting pathway. Cibenzoline also depressed contractions and increased A-H conduction time, implying restriction of slow inward current. The bradycardia could thus be attributed to a slowing of both depolarization and repolarization in the SA node, without any change in slope of the slow diastolic depolarization.

40|$|Abstract Introduction There {{are limited}} {{treatment}} options {{for people with}} schizophrenia with cytochrome P 450 2 D 6 ultrarapid metabolizer status who {{do not respond to}} amisulpride. Furthermore, the literature does not provide evidence-based guidelines for this particular constellation. Case presentation We report the case of a 50 -year-old Caucasian female patient with schizophrenia and cytochrome P 450 2 D 6 ultrarapid metabolizer status who experienced an insufficient antipsychotic effect with amisulpride. She was successfully treated with melperone-augmented haloperidol. Conclusion This report yields melperone-augmented haloperidol as a possible pharmacological strategy in the described situation. In addition, our observations support the available evidence for the potential of <b>melperone</b> to act as an inhibitor of cytochrome P 450 2 D 6. </p...|$|E
40|$|Serotonin and α 1 {{adrenergic}} receptor antagonism {{may contribute to}} atypical antipsychotic drug effects. Clozapine (2. 5 mg/kg) drug discrimination in C 57 BL/ 6 mice may selectively screen atypical antipsychotic drugs. Previous data show that the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone but not the typical antipsychotic haloperidol fully substitutes for clozapine. The present study demonstrated that the atypical antipsychotics quetiapine, sertindole, zotepine, iloperidone, <b>melperone</b> fully substituted for clozapine but aripiprazole did not. The typical antipsychotics fluphenazine and perphenazine failed to fully substitute for clozapine but chlorpromazine and thioridazine fully substituted for clozapine. This model does not differentiate between atypical and typical antipsychotic drugs {{but it may be}} useful in the detection of antipsychotics with potent serotonin and α 1 {{adrenergic receptor}} antagonist actions...|$|E
40|$|Reperfusion-induced arrhythmias were {{elicited}} in the pentobarbitone-anaesthetized rat by occlusion of {{the left}} main coronary artery and subsequent release. These arrhythmias were rapid in onset, occurring within 20 s after release of the ligature, and were of short duration (1 - 2 min). Their severity was dependent upon {{the duration of the}} preceding occlusion. A 5 or 15 min occlusion period produced the most severe arrhythmias on release, the incidence of ventricular fibrillation being 56 and 50 % respectively. Evidence that reperfusion had occurred was provided by fluorescein dye distribution and intramyocardial temperature studies. The severity of reperfusion arrhythmias and mortality was unaffected by bilateral vagotomy, beta-adrenoceptor blockade by atenolol (2 mg kg- 1 i. v.) or a combination of the two. The incidence of reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation was significantly reduced by Org 6001 (which blocks the fast inward sodium current), <b>melperone</b> (which acutely prolongs the cardiac action potential duration) and bepridil (which blocks both fast and slow inward currents). It was unaffected by nitroglycerine and the calcium antagonists verapamil, prenylamine and nifedipine. We have shown that reperfusion-induced cardiac arrhythmias can be consistently elicited in the anaesthetized rat and that they are particularly susceptible to drugs that can block the fast inward sodium current...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive {{impairments}} {{are considered}} to largely affect functional outcome in patients with schizophrenia, other psychotic illnesses, or mood disorders. Specifically, there is {{much attention to the}} role of psychotropic compounds acting on serotonin (5 -HT) receptors in ameliorating cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. It is noteworthy that atypical antipsychotic drugs, e. g. clozapine, <b>melperone,</b> risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, perospirone, blonanserin, and lurasidone, have variable affinities for these receptors. Among the 5 -HT receptor subtypes, the 5 -HT 1 A receptor is attracting particular interests as a potential target for enhancing cognition, based on preclinical and clinical evidence. The neural network underlying the ability of 5 -HT 1 A agonists to treat cognitive impairments of schizophrenia likely includes dopamine, glutamate, and GABA neurons. A novel strategy for cognitive enhancement in psychosis may be benefitted by focusing on energy metabolism in the brain. In this context, lactate plays a major role, and has been shown to protect neurons against oxidative and other stressors. In particular, our data indicate chronic treatment with tandospirone, a partial 5 -HT 1 A agonist, recover stress-induced lactate production in the prefrontal cortex of a rat model of schizophrenia. Recent advances of electrophysiological measures, e. g. event-related potentials, and their imaging have provided insights into facilitative effects on cognition of some atypical antipsychotic drugs acting directly or indirectly on 5 -HT 1 A receptors. These findings are expected to promote the development of novel therapeutics for the improvement of functional outcome in people with schizophrenia...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-two {{neuroleptic}} {{drugs were}} studied for {{interaction with the}} behavior induced by intravenous injection of apomorphine in rats. All compounds dose-dependently shortened {{the duration of the}} apomorphine-induced agitation and—with the exception of clozapine—shortened the onset of the de-arousal grooming that typically occurs immediately after the agitation phase has been terminated. Progressively higher doses were required to antagonize higher levels of apomorphine at earlier time intervals after the intravenous injection. The compounds also decreased palpebral opening, and most of them suppressed grooming behavior at higher doses. Compounds differed considerably in dose increments required for: 1) suppression of grooming, from 0. 33 for clozapine to. 600 for remoxipride, raclopride, and droperidol; 2) blockade of agitation at 5 minutes after apomorphine, from 2. 6 for pimozide to 165 for chlorprothixene and 254 for remoxipride; 3) mild decrease of palpebral opening, from 0. 21 for sertindole to 191 for remoxipride; and 4) pronounced de-crease of palpebral opening, from 10 for <b>melperone</b> to. 820 for raclopride. Only four compounds were able to advance grooming to 15 minutes postapomorphine, but again dose increments varied considerably: droperidol (3. 4), pimozide (9. 1), raclopride (42), and remoxipride (383). Based on these results obtained in a single animal model, compounds were differentiated in terms of behavioral specificity, incisiveness (the power to counteract the effects of progressively higher apomorphine concentra-tions), and sedative side-effect liability. Possible explanations for the observed differences and clinical relevance are discussed...|$|E
