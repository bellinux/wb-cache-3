50|$|In the 1970s, a new {{approach}} to wireline logging was introduced in the form of logging while drilling (LWD). This technique provides similar well information to conventional wireline logging but instead of sensors being lowered into the well at the end of wireline cable, the sensors are integrated into the drill string and the measurements are made in real-time, whilst the well is being drilled. This allows drilling engineers and geologists to quickly obtain information such as porosity, resistivity, hole direction and weight-on-bit and they can use this information to make immediate decisions {{about the future of the}} well and the direction of drilling. In LWD, measured data is transmitted to the surface in real time via pressure pulses in the well's <b>mud</b> <b>fluid</b> column. This mud telemetry method provides a bandwidth of less than 10 bits per second, although, as drilling through rock is a fairly slow process, data compression techniques mean that this is an ample bandwidth for real-time delivery of information. A higher sample rate of data is recorded into memory and retrieved when the drillstring is withdrawn at bit changes. High-definition downhole and subsurface information is available through networked or wired drillpipe that deliver memory quality data in real time.|$|E

Chemical constituents (cations, anions, trace elements, organic carbon, humic acid, and stable isotopes) in both <b>fluids</b> and <b>mud</b> were analyzed {{to investigate the}} geochemical processes and spatial variability among the mud volcanoes under consideration. Analytical results suggested that the anoxic <b>mud</b> volcanic <b>fluids</b> are highly saline, implying connate water as the probable source. The isotopic signature indicated that δ 18 O-rich fluids {{may be associated with}} silicate and carbonate mineral released through water-rock interaction, along with dehydration of clay minerals.

Volcanic <b>mud</b> and <b>fluids</b> are rich in organic matter (in terms of organic carbon), and the presence of humic acid in mud has implications for the binding of arsenic. Functional groups of humic acid also showed variable sources of organic matter among the mud volcanoes being examined.

30|$|Lost {{circulation}} {{has been}} a serious problem while drilling {{that may lead to}} heavy financial costs in the form of lost rig time and lost <b>mud</b> <b>fluid.</b> In severe cases, it can lead to well blowout with serious environmental hazards and safety consequences. Despite extensive advances {{in the last couple of}} decades, lost circulation materials used today still have disadvantages such as damaging production zones, failing to seal large fractures or plugging drilling tools. Here, we propose a new class of smart expandable lost circulation material (LCM) to remotely control the expanding force and functionality of the injected LCM. Our smart LCM is made out of shape memory polymers that become activated by formation’s natural heat. Once activated, these particles can effectively seal fractures’ width without damaging pores in the production zone or plugging drilling tools. The activation temperature of the proposed LCM can be adjusted based on the formation’s temperature. We conducted a series of experiments to measure the sealing efficiency of these smart LCMs as a proof of concept study. Various slot disk sizes were used to mimic different size fractures in the formation. The API RP 13 B- 1 and 13 B- 2 have been followed as standard testing methods to evaluate this product.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fluid</b> <b>mud</b> is {{a highly}} {{concentrated}} suspension of fine-grained cohesive sediment, which often occurs in estuarine turbidity maximum zones (ETMZs) throughout the world. As an interface between the sea and inland, the estuarine zone {{is considered to be}} an ideal location for trade and thus ports are constructed in the estuarine zone. The occurrence of <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> is problematic as it might restrain navigability. Besides, cohesive sediments like mud particles are known to be the main carrier of pollutants as they specifically absorb contaminants from the water. Thus the management of estuarine and harbour <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> is a matter of considerable importance in the practice of hydraulic and environmental engineering. Current <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> models which are being used as a tool for making predictions require substantial site-specific validation to observations, and often give disappointing results due to an insufficient knowledge of underlying biogeochemical and physical mechanisms governing <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> dynamics. Detailed in situ measurements of <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> with high temporal and spatial resolution remain lacking due to laborious and costly measuring campaigns. In this study <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> dynamics in ETMZs were investigated by application of a numerical model and based on data of two field measurement campaigns. The numerical modelling study had been based on data from an early field survey in the Weser estuary. The entrainment of <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> deposited in dune troughs was studied in a series of scenario simulations and the suitability of entrainment formulae implemented in the model has been examined. The numerical model has been shown to simulate the entrainment of <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> layer from the dune troughs at peak tidal currents and reformation at slack waters, which were observed in early field surveys. It was concluded that a further development of the numerical <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> model cannot be independent of field measurements. In order to gain more insights into associated processes of <b>fluid</b> <b>mud,</b> two field campaigns have been conducted. Based on data of the first measurement campaign which was conducted in a stable ETMZ of the German Ems estuary, a new method to rapidly examine position, strength and dynamics of the <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> lutocline is introduced. With high temporal and spatial resolution the intratidal variability of the <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> lutocline characteristics and its dependency on forcing hydrodynamics are demonstrated. The lutocline appeared to undergo a cyclical evolution governed by several processes like entrainment, hindered settling and dewatering under the tidal forcing. In the second campaign which was conducted in an oscillatory ETMZ being recovering in the German Ems estuary, quantitative measures of a mobile <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> layer and its lutocline stability were explored based on observed calibrated gradient Richardson numbers. The calibrated gradient Richardson numbers have shown a stabilization and formation of the lutocline which is existent for several hours over high slack water. A new method to derive backscatter gradient Richardson numbers has been introduced, which does not require any calibration of backscatter gradients to suspended sediment concentration (SSC) gradients. The backscatter gradient Richardson numbers {{have been found to be}} also able to measure the <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> lutocline stability. A snapshot of reformation of <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> layer was captured in the ETMZ being recovering. These two field campaigns have both shown a strong tidal asymmetry with significant flood dominance and much longer high slack water than low slack water, which can be considered as a major cause of the formation of ETMZ in the Ems estuary. The hindered settling which played a crucial role in the increase of strength of lutocline as the field measurements revealed, could be implemented in future model developments.

40|$|A {{reliable}} static formation {{temperature is}} valuable in determining casing depths, establishing geothermal gradients, analyzing logs and estimating fluid potential for geothermal reservoirs. The conventional drilling <b>mud</b> <b>fluid</b> systems associated with geothermal well drilling distort the static formation temperature near the wellbore because the circulating mud temperature is normally {{much less than}} the static formation temperature. As a result, a wellbore temperature recorded during drilling operations does not reflect the static formation condition. The use of a Horner-type temperature buildup plot, similar to the conventional pressure buildup method, has been suggested for estimating static formation temperature. The method has proven satisfactory in a number of oil and gas field cases. Recently, Dowdle and Cobb investigated the conditions under which the Horner temperature plot can be used to yield representative static formation temperatures. They concluded that the method is reliable if both the wellbore temperature gradient changes very slowly and the mud circulation time is short. However, in geothermal operations, temperature gradients are usually more extreme and longer circulation times are required to cool the wellbore sufficiently for logging. Therefore, the method has proved to be less reliable. As an alternative solution, dimensionless Horner temperature type curves have been developed for determining reliable static formation temperatures under normal geothermal drilling conditions in the Imperial Valley, California.

40|$|International audienceThe {{fracture}} porosity is estimated especially through the log data (density, neutron porosity and transit time) and {{the characteristics of}} the <b>mud</b> (<b>fluid</b> density, transit time of the saturating fluid). If one of these parameters is lacking, the estimation of the natural {{fracture porosity}} using log data becomes impossible. The problem found in the study area of the Hassi Messaoud oil field is that the transit time is missing in many wells, which makes the calculations of the natural fracture porosity difficult. A methodology is proposed in this paper to estimate this parameter by means of fuzzy ranking and artificial neural network (ANN) using four conventional log data (deep resistivity, density, neutron porosity and gamma ray) from well# 1 and well# 2 in Hassi Messaoud oil field. Fuzzy ranking is used to rank the log data input with the degree of influence at the desired output of the ANN, the results obtained confirm that all data used by ANN are important and we cannot neglect any one.

40|$|Cohesive sediments {{transport}} {{has been}} systematically studied {{for more than}} a century from field studies, laboratory experiments, and mathematical models. During the past decades, the accumulation of flocculated cohesive sediments and the formation of weakly consolidated mud deposits, including fluid mud, gained increased attention. Despite extensive research efforts, the governing processes of fluid mud formation are far from being fully understood. The primary objective of this study is to investigate tide-driven dynamics of fluid mud in estuaries. State of the art hydroacoustic subbottom (SES) and current velocity profilers (ADCP) are used, to measure fluid mud dynamics on appropriate temporal and spatial scales. Connected fields of research are to be taken into account, such as bedload transport and the influence of subaqueous dunes on the turbulent flow field. Technical aspects are considered, in particular the detection of suspended cohesive sediments. Measurements are conducted in the Ems and the Weser estuary, located along the North Sea coast of Germany. Other study sites in the North Sea are the Jade Bay in Germany and the Grådyb tidal inlet in Denmark. Not only the combined deployment of different hydroacoustic profiling devices but also the combined processing of collected data allows fluid mud dynamics to be studied in great detail. Combined processing is implemented in a software tool, programmed in MATLABTM. The software facilitates the acoustic backscatter calibration with respect to suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and thus joins information on hydrodynamic, near-bed density stratification and SSC in the water column. A large data set is collected in the Weser estuary and analysed regarding tide-driven dynamics of fluid <b>mud.</b> <b>Fluid</b> mud does not appear in the suggested form of a contiguous layer, but is deposited in depressions, in troughs of subaqueous dunes, as well as in the form of mud drapes during slack water. Entrainment is controlled by local production of turbulence, which is, in turn, influenced by local morphology. Fluid mud deposits in dune troughs are rapidly entrained, induced by strong turbulent stresses which are generated at the dune crest and advected in direction of the lutocline, i. e. the density gradient between fluid mud and the water column. Mobile mud layers are significantly resistant to entrainment and partly survive half a tidal cycle. Continuous feeding by slack water deposition induces a positive feedback of increasing concentrations and increased damping of turbulence, which inevitably leads to the formation of erosion-resistant estuarine mud deposits. A new method for the detection of density stratification is introduced, based on the backscatter gradient of acoustic current profiles. Furthermore, the gradient Richardson stability criterion is also expressed in terms of the backscatter gradient and proved to be applicable in order to assess lutocline stability under intricate hydrodynamic conditions in the Ems estuary. In the heavily engineered Ems estuary, weir closure during flood slack water and the subsequent release of captured water masses induce the flushing of the estuary and catastrophic downstream advection of fluid mud. By the time the estuary returns to flood-dominated conditions, fluid mud is rapidly advected upstream and re-established in the upper part of the estuary. In the Grådyb tidal inlet channel bedload transport in presence of large dunes is determined on the basis of highly accurate multibeam measurements. Bathymetrical changes are converted into bedload transport rates, which are not predicted by classical bedload transport formulae due to variations in grain-size composition of the mobilised sediment. Results from this study are applied to the Weser estuary to infer that lee-side deposition occurs simultaneously to the entrainment of fluid mud in dune troughs. An instrumental study conducted in the Jade Bay concerning suspended sediment dynamics reveals that suspended sediment is transported in form of turbidity clouds. Thereby, acoustic methods underestimate SSC when large aggregates are present. Several floc populations coexist in the water column, covering a wide range of sizes from a few microns to millimetre size...|$|E

The findings will also help to understand the interaction between the newly applied in situ detection technique and the behaviour of <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> suspensions which has to be investigated further...|$|R
40|$|The maximum {{turbidity}} zone (MTZ) of the Gironde Estuary is a site {{of important}} mineralization of particulate organic nitrogen. Moreover, this MTZ is characterized by intense cycles of settling and resuspension of anoxic <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> at both tidal and neap-spring time-scales. In the upper layer of the <b>fluid</b> <b>mud,</b> which was deposited at tidal slack and eroded during each ebb and flood, a denitrification rate of up to 65 µmol l - 1 h - 1 was measured during the transient period of settling. High concentrations of NO - 2 (up to 13 µM), and N 2 O (up to 1500 nM) were observed in this layer at tidal slack, either due to an incomplete nitrification at low oxygen concentrations or to high denitrification activity. This suggests that deposition and erosion of the upper <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> at the tidal time-scale could be {{an important source of}} N 2 O for the estuarine overlying waters. The deepest layer of the <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> was more turbid, NO 3 - depleted and remained stable throughout tidal cycles, during several days. In this layer, ammonification was responsible for an increase of NH + 4. Most probable number (MPN) counts of ammonium oxidizing bacteria in turbid water and <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> revealed that they were closely associated with particles, whereas potential nitrification rates were rather constant (10 - 14 µmol l - 1 h - 1) irrespective of the suspended matter concentrations. In the MTZ of the Gironde, nitrogen behaves like in activated sludge reactors, with oxic/anoxic oscillations occurring at the tidal time scale. Nitrification takes place in the oxic water column and denitrification in the anoxic <b>fluid</b> <b>mud.</b> However at the whole estuarine scale the loss of particulate nitrogen and the gain of total dissolved inorganic nitrogen are in the same order of magnitude, which suggests that the net loss of nitrogen from the system is rather limited. This seems {{due to the fact that}} high denitrification rates are limited both in time (tidal slacks) and space (upper layers of <b>fluid</b> <b>mud).</b> However, our study emphasises the importance of settling/erosion transition periods on the nitrogen dynamics in estuarine maximum turbidity zones...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop greater understanding of the dynamics of <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> and its role in the transport and deposition of sediment on the continental margin. In particular, we seek greater understanding of the processes that influence the formation and maintenance of <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> in energetic environments. OBJECTIVES The research is a process-based study that addresses three primary objectives: •	 Determine controlling factors in the formation and destruction of <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> under a sheared flow •	 Verify Richardson number dependence for suppression of turbulence and carrying capacity of a high-concentration suspension •	 Evaluate effects of mixed grain size on high-concentration suspensions APPROACH To evaluate the controls on fluid-mud formation and the influence of sediment-induced stratification on flow, in situ measurements of vertical gradients of velocity, suspended-sediment concentration, and fluid density throughout the water column, including the fluid-mud layer are necessary. In addition to these parameters, the thickness of the <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> layer through accelerating and decelerating flows must be measured. The Peticodiac River located in the Upper Bay of Fundy was selected as the study site. The Peticodiac Estuary is a macro-tidal environment that has been modified by the construction of a causeway in the...|$|R

40|$|A 3 -D {{model has}} been {{developed}} for the muddy Jiaojiang Estuary and adjoining coastal waters, and verified against field observations. To simulate fluid-mud formation, the model uses a fine resolution grid near the bottom and involves coupling processes between hydrodynamics and <b>fluid</b> <b>mud</b> such as the sediment-induced buoyancy, increasing turbulent kinetic energy sink and kinematic viscosity, mixing by internal waves riding on the lutocline, and non-Newtonian properties of <b>fluid</b> <b>mud.</b> The effective hydrodynamic drag was reduced {{in the presence of}} <b>fluid</b> <b>mud.</b> It is shown that the estuary is infilled by tidal pumping and that longitudinal and transversal gradients of suspended sediment concentration, salinity, and currents control the formation of mud banks. Thus a 3 -D model is necessary to estimate the fate of mud, although the model results are very sensitive to details of the parameterization of the hydrodynamics-mud feedback processes...|$|R
