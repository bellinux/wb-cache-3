40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{discusses}} {{the implementation of}} monetary policy in New Zealand and its flow-on effects on the 90 -day bank bill rate over the 1999 - 2005 period. The effects of external factors are considered as well. Our findings indicate that the maturity spectrum ratio exerted {{a positive effect on}} the 90 -day rate while the <b>allotment</b> <b>ratio</b> did not. This interest rate had a tendency to revert to the level set by its Australian counterpart. No such link exists between the NZ 90 -day rate and the US 90 -day rate. Neither the maturity spectrum nor the <b>allotment</b> <b>ratio</b> contributed to the volatility of the New Zealand 90 -day rate...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} effects of the SNB's operating procedure on the adjustment speed and the volatility of Swiss franc Libor of different maturities. More precisely it presents econometric estimates of the effect of the two characteristics of the repo auctions on the conditional mean and variance of the Libor using daily data from January 2000 to September 2003. The results obtained indicate that the total <b>allotment</b> <b>ratio</b> and the share of the allotment to one-day repos on total allotment have no influence on the adjustment speed of the Libor to the center of the target range. However, the <b>allotment</b> <b>ratio</b> has a clear and highly significant negative influence on the volatility of short-term rates.

In both of these rural areas, the <b>minimum</b> <b>allotment</b> condition is 5000  m 2.

5|$|In 1961 a {{residents}} progress {{association was}} formed. A prime goal was {{the building of}} a reservoir—supplied from the river—on Armidale hill overlooking the town. To defray costs and gain council acceptance, {{a large part of the}} work was performed by volunteers. This scheme began supplying the town on 17 February 1961. Up to the 1970s, Carrick's growth was limited by the lack of town sewerage—which restricted the <b>minimum</b> <b>allotment</b> size—and reluctance of landowner's to subdivide property. A 1977 planning study found that the land structure allowed most of the town to be served by a gravity fed system and recommended construction. As of 2008 the majority of the town was connected to reticulated water and sewerage.|$|R
50|$|During the 1880s Brisbane {{had grown}} spectacularly. The {{population}} {{more than doubled}} to over 90,000 in 1891, primarily due to immigration. This stimulated building activity, municipal organisation, provision of amenities and services, and cultural and leisure outlets. The number of inhabited dwellings almost doubled between 1881 and 1891, from 5,814 to 10,321. Aided by the requirement of the Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885, which enforced a <b>minimum</b> <b>allotment</b> size, this population increase caused Brisbane to overshoot its boundaries, growing {{along the lines of}} transport (railway, road, tram and omnibus routes which were dictated by the hilly topography of the area) until the town coalesced with its fringe settlements transforming them into suburbs.|$|R

40|$|In a three-stage game {{in which}} banks can obtain {{liquidity}} through open market operations, interbank transactions or standing facilities we compare the equilibrium outcomes of fixed and variable rate tenders in the primary market. We focus on bidding behavior, induced <b>allotment</b> <b>ratios,</b> functioning of the secondary market and resorting to standing facilities, under several scenarios, among which collateral shortage and credit rationing. It is shown that overbidding is inherent to the fixed rate auction, but can be very mitigated under a variable rate procedure. Due {{to the existence of}} a finite number of equilibria, variable rate tenders allow keeping the informational content of quantity bids, as opposed to fixed rate tenders. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} a comprehensive {{analysis on the}} characteristics of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and listing day stock return performance of Mainland Chinese (Mainland) firms and Hong Kong SAR(HK) firms, both listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) from 1993 to 1997. The results indicate some significant differences in IPO returns and performance forecasts between Mainland and HK firms. However, the over-subscription <b>ratios,</b> the <b>allotment</b> <b>ratios</b> between small and large investors, and the intra-day price patterns on the listing day for both Mainland and HK firms are similar. These findings indicate that the HK firms are more under-priced than the Mainland firms. In addition, Mainland firms report a more optimistic earnings and dividend yield estimates than the HK firms. Finally, small investors receive similar percentages of shares from IPO underwriters for both Mainland and HK issues. School of Accounting and Financ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{two measures}} of <b>allotment</b> <b>ratios</b> for small investors {{to examine the}} strategic share allocation strategy of IPO underwriters in Hong Kong. Employing a sample of 267 IPOs from 1993 to 1997 and statistical analyses including two-sample comparisons and regression models, we find evidence that underwriters use non-discretionary allocation of IPOs to favor small investors in Hong Kong. The results support our argument that in an IPO market where investment bankers {{do not have a}} trusting relationship with large investors and an effective mechanism to monitor block traders' selling, IPO underwriters explicitly allocate relatively more shares of better (more-underpriced) IPOs to a larger number of small (loyal) investors. The result may be driven by the regulatory concern on protecting the interest of small investors in Hong Kong. Hence, our evidence suggests that the IPO share allocation strategy is very different between Hong Kong and US. IPO Strategic allocation Underpricings...|$|R

Compared with {{developed}} capital markets, Korean IPO {{markets are}} operating under relatively stronger financial regulations of public authorities. Policy-makers have {{the incentive to}} set the IPO offer price lower, so that the stock price after listing remains higher than the offer price. We have examined the negative effect of IPO underpricing by examining the stock price behavior of IPO shares after listing. If excessive underpricing of an IPO share offers investors the opportunity of realizing short-term gains, then it {{would serve as a}} mechanism for preventing from maintaining a stable share price after listing. The main results of this study are as follows. First, around 48 % of IPO firms have their share prices below their offer prices in a month after listing, even though their average initial return is 33 %. Second, the <b>allotment</b> <b>ratio</b> of IPO shares does not have any relationship with the share price in a month: it has the strong relationship only with the initial return. Third, the high volatility of IPO shares is mainly due to the price fluctuation in the initial trading. Fourth, firms wth excessive initial returns are more likely to suffer from price declines in a month after listing. Theses findings support the view that the excessive underpricing of IPO shares can work as a mechanism for preventing from maintaining a stable share price after listing. ? ??? ????? ????? ???? ?????(HY- 2014 -G) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{a shared}} server infrastructure, a {{scheduler}} controls how quantities of resources are shared {{over time in}} a fair manner across multiple, competing consumers. It should support wide (parallel) requests for variable-sized pool of resources, provide assurance of <b>minimum</b> resource <b>allotment</b> on demand, and give predictable assignments to plan their resource usage (e. g., advance reservations). Our approach integrates a fair queuing algorithm with a calendar scheduler. We present Winks, a proportional share allocation policy that addresses the needs of shared server environments. It extends start-time fair queuing to supports wide requests with backfill, advance reservations, dynamic cluster sizing, dynamic request sizing, and intraflow request prioritization. We show that it preserves fairness properties across queue transformations and calendar operations needed to implement these extensions. The analysis and experimental results show that Winks enforces shares effectively, even when wide requests would otherwise prevent a flow from making progress. While the algorithm {{is presented in the}} context of a virtual computing system, it is also applicable as a full-featured job scheduler. 1...|$|R
