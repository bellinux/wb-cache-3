5|$|Acute <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemia</b> is a {{relatively}} rare cancer. There are approximately 10,500 new cases {{each year in the}} United States, and the incidence rate has remained stable from 1995 through 2005. AML accounts for 1.2% of all cancer deaths in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Recent discoveries have {{identified}} key molecular {{events in the}} pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), caused by chromosomal rearrangements of the transcription factor RAR (resulting in a fusion protein with the product of other cellular genes, such as PML). Oligomerization of RAR, through a self-association domain present in PML, imposes an altered interaction with transcriptional co-regulators (NCoR/SMRT). NCoR/SMRT are responsible for recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs), which is required for transcriptional repression of PML-RAR target genes, and for the transforming potential of the fusion protein. Oligomerization and altered recruitment of HDACs are also responsible for transformation by the fusion protein AML 1 -ETO, extending these mechanisms {{to other forms of}} acute <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemias</b> (AMLs) and suggesting that HDAC is a common target for <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemias.</b> Strikingly, AML 1 -ETO expression blocks retinoic acid (RA) signaling in hematopoietic cells, suggesting that interference with the RA pathway (genetically altered in APL) by HDAC recruitment may be a common theme in AMLs. Treatment of APLs with RA, and of other AMLs with RA plus HDAC inhibitors (HDACi), results in myeloid differentiation. Thus, activation of the RA signaling pathway and inhibition of HDAC activity might represent a general strategy for the differentiation treatment of <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemias...</b>|$|R
5|$|Three of the {{observers}} eventually died of {{conditions that are}} known to be promoted by radiation: Graves of a heart attack 20 years later at age 55; Cieslicki of acute <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemia</b> 19 years later at age 42; and Young of aplastic anemia and bacterial infection of the heart lining 27 years later at age 83. Although some of those deaths were probably latent stochastic (random) effects of the accident, {{it is not possible to}} draw any definitive conclusions from such a small sample set.|$|E
5|$|Base J (beta-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil), a {{modified}} form of uracil, {{is also found}} in several organisms: the flagellates Diplonema and Euglena, and all the kinetoplastid genera. Biosynthesis of J occurs in two steps: in the first step, a specific thymidine in DNA is converted into hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine; in the second, HOMedU is glycosylated to form J. Proteins that bind specifically to this base have been identified. These proteins appear to be distant relatives of the Tet1 oncogene that is involved in the pathogenesis of acute <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemia.</b> J appears to act as a termination signal for RNA polymerase II.|$|E
5|$|The disease-modifying {{treatments}} {{have several}} adverse effects. One {{of the most}} common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with subcutaneous injections and 33% with intramuscular injections). Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop. Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes. More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons, systolic dysfunction (12%), infertility, and acute <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemia</b> (0.8%) from mitoxantrone, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring with natalizumab (occurring in 1 in 600 people treated).|$|E

40|$|AbstractCas-Br-M {{murine leukemia}} virus (MuLV) is a slow-transforming {{retrovirus}} that potently induces leukemias in mice and therefore is well suited for retroviral insertional mutagenesis. We used Cas-Br-M MuLV in NIH/Swiss mice {{to establish a new}} panel of mainly <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemias.</b> All tumors found in leukemic animals were classified by gross pathology, morphology, and immunophenotype, as well as the incidence of known common virus integration sites (VISs) in MuLV-induced myeloid malignancies (i. e., Evi 1, Evi 11 /Cb 2, Evi 12, Fli 1, and c-Myb). Interestingly, male mice were more susceptible than females to the induction of leukemia by Cas-Br-M MuLV. Seventy-four of the Cas-Br-M MuLV-inoculated mice developed a severe splenomegaly, sometimes in association with a thymoma. Although most of the immunophenotyped Cas-Br-M MuLV tumors were of myeloid origin (58 %), numerous T-cell leukemias (21 %) and mixed myeloid/T-cell leukemias (21 %) were found. The <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemias</b> and <b>myeloid</b> compartment of the mixed leukemias were further characterized by immunophenotyping with stem cell-, myeloid-, and erythroid-specific antibodies. The known Cas-Br-M MuLV common VISs (Evi 1, Evi 11 /Cb 2, and Evi 12) were demonstrated in 19 %, 12 %, and 20 % of the cases, respectively, whereas no Fli 1 and c-Myb rearrangements were found. Integrations into Evi 1 were restricted to <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemias,</b> whereas those in Evi 11 /Cb 2 and Evi 12 were identified in myeloid as well as T-lymphoid leukemias. This panel of well characterized Cas-Br-M MuLV-induced hematopoietic tumors may be useful for the isolation and characterization of new proto-oncogenes involved in <b>myeloid</b> or T-cell <b>leukemias...</b>|$|R

25|$|The exact {{cause of}} leukemia is unknown. Different kinds of leukemia are {{believed}} to have different causes. Both inherited and environmental (non-inherited) factors {{are believed to}} be involved. Risk factors include smoking, ionizing radiation, some chemicals (such as benzene), prior chemotherapy, and Down syndrome. People with a family history of leukemia are also at higher risk. There are four main types of leukemia — acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemia</b> (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemia</b> (CML) — {{as well as a number}} of less common types.

PI 3 K-mutant mice have hemato-logic defects and are predisposed to co-lon cancer. On {{the basis of these}} data, PIK 3 CG was evaluated as a candidate myeloid tumor suppressor gene (TSG). PIK 3 CG was mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization adjacent and telomeric to a commonly deleted segment defined previously in <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemias</b> with breakpoints within 7 q 22. PIK 3 CG con-tains 10 exons and spans approximately 37 kilobases of genomic DNA. Forty leuke-mias with monosomy 7 or a del(7 q) were screened for PIK 3 CG mutations. Two pa-tients had missense variations affecting residue 859 in the N-terminal catalytic domain of the protein.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{provides}} immunobiochemical and molecular {{data on the}} differentiation-linked expression of the bcl- 2 proto-oncogene in normal and neoplastic myeloid cells. Using a recently developed monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to the bcl- 2 molecule, staining of normal bone marrow myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes, but neither monocytes nor most polymorphonuclear cells, was demonstrated. By two-color flow cytometric analysis, bcl- 2 was evidenced in CD 33 + and CD 33 +/CD 34 + myeloid cells {{as well as in}} the more primitive CD 33 -/CD 34 + population. The leukemic cell lines HL- 60, KG 1, GM- 1, and K 562 were bcl- 2 positive together with 11 of 14 acute <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemias</b> (AML) and three of three chronic <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemias</b> (CML) in blast crises; six of seven CML were negative. Among myelodysplastic cases, augmentation of the bcl- 2 positive myeloblastic compartment was found in refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) and in transformation (RAEB-t). Western blots of <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemias</b> and control lymphocytes extracts evidenced an anti-bcl- 2 immunoreactive band of the expected size (26 Kd). Moreover, the HL- 60 and KG 1 cell lines, both positive for the bcl- 2 protein, exhibited the appropriate size bcl- 2 mRNA (7. 5 Kb). These findings clearly indicate that the bcl- 2 gene is operative in myeloid cells and that the anti-bcl- 2 MoAb identifies its product and not a cross-reactive epitope. Induction of HL- 60 differentiation toward the monocytic and granulocytic pathways was accompanied by a marked decrease in bcl- 2 mRNA and protein levels; bivariate flow cytometric analysis showed that the fraction becoming bcl- 2 negative was in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle. These data establish that the bcl- 2 proto-oncogene is expressed on myeloid cells and their progenitors and is regulated in a differentiation-linked manner...|$|R

40|$|P 75 /AIRM 1 is a {{recently}} identified surface molecule {{that belongs to}} the sialoadhesin family and displays homology with the myeloid cell antigen CD 33. In lymphoid cells, p 75 /AIRM 1 is confined to natural killer cells and mediates inhibition of their cytolytic activity. In this study, we show that p 75 /AIRM 1 is also expressed by cells of the myelomonocytic cell lineage, in which it appears at a later stage as compared with CD 33. In vitro proliferation and differentiation of cord blood-derived CD 34 + cells (induced by stem cell factor and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor) were consistently inhibited {{by the addition of}} anti-p 75 /AIRM 1 mAb. Engagement of CD 33 led to inhibition in some experiments. A sharp decrease of cell proliferation/survival was detected in all three p 75 /AIRM 1 + chronic <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemias</b> analyzed when cultured in the presence of either anti-p 75 /AIRM 1 or anti-CD 33 mAbs. Thus, the present study suggests that p 75 /AIRM 1 and CD 33 may play a regulatory role in normal myelopoiesis and may be viewed as suitable target molecules to counteract the proliferation/survival of chronic <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemias...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recently, the President&#x 2019;s Cancer Panel [2008 - 2009] {{protested that}} {{preventive}} {{action is not}} taken when uncertainty exists about potential harm from a chemical, because the US regulatory approach demands that a hazard be incontrovertibly demonstrated. It is now incontrovertible that formaldehyde increases risks for leukemias. Evidence is also strong that formaldehyde causes some types of DNA damage in humans that are known to require repairs mediated by BRCA 1 / 2 containing pathways. Homologous recombination repairs require BRCA 1 / 2, Fanconi and ATM proteins in these pathways. Biallelic BRCA 2 mutations interfere with these repairs and are clearly associated with <b>leukemias,</b> especially <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemias.</b> Fanconi anemia homozygotes have very high risks for acute <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukemias.</b> Disabling BRCA 1 / 2 related DNA repair processes prevents repair of formaldehyde related DNA damage in laboratory cells. DNA-protein cross links result in the accumulation of DNA double strand breaks in homologous recombination-deficient but not homologous recombination -proficient cells. ATM heterozygotes have increased risks for some leukemias that {{have been linked to}} formaldehyde in normal individuals. Weaker evidence suggests increased risk for rare nasopharyngeal or sinonasal cancers in heterozygous BRCA 1 / 2 mutation carriers and in ATM mutation carriers. |$|R
