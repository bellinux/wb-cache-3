5|$|Tolls {{cannot be}} levied on the ferry without {{changing}} the 1885 Act of Parliament. However, {{it is possible}} that the service <b>may</b> <b>eventually</b> be tolled in conjunction with other projects such as the Gallions Reach Crossing, which is likely to be tolled.|$|E
5|$|A {{result of}} {{dysplasia}} is usually further investigated, such as {{by taking a}} cone biopsy, which may also remove the cancerous lesion. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is a possible result of the biopsy, and represents dysplastic changes that <b>may</b> <b>eventually</b> progress to invasive cancer. Most cases of cervical cancer are detected in this way, without having caused any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include vaginal bleeding, discharge, or discomfort.|$|E

5|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} is reversible in {{the early}} stages by use of break periods on lower pressures of oxygen, but it <b>may</b> <b>eventually</b> result in irreversible lung injury if allowed to progress to severe damage. One or two days of exposure without oxygen breaks are needed to cause such damage.|$|E
5|$|Even where a {{concurrent}} use registration is issued, the parties <b>may</b> <b>eventually</b> {{come to an}} agreement under which one party will surrender its registration. In some instances, a party will simply happen to cease using the mark in favor of a new brand name, and the registration will lapse. In other cases, the larger company will eventually acquire the smaller.|$|E
5|$|S.thiersii may be {{gathered}} inadvertently and {{thought to be}} edible {{due to the fact}} that it grows on lawns among grasses. This is in contrast to Amanita species which grow around trees and are thus usually seen in forests. It can be distinguished from other white fungi growing in grassland by its fluffy cap, though the white veil fragments <b>may</b> <b>eventually</b> get washed away by rain.|$|E

50|$|Taribavirin is {{as active}} against {{influenza}} as ribavirin in animal models, with slightly less toxicity, so it <b>may</b> also <b>eventually</b> replace ribavirin as an anti-influenza agent.|$|R
50|$|As voting day draws closer, <b>Mays</b> <b>eventually</b> learns {{the reason}} why he {{was chosen as the}} party candidate, fires some disloyal {{campaign}} operatives (although they reconciled with him afterwards), and chooses his brother as his running mate. He later has a debate with his opponent in which he manages to win the crowd over by speaking truth about the American life. Finally, Mays ends up winning the election and the presidency. The film ends with a shot of Mount Rushmore with Mays Gilliam's head added, complete with bling.|$|R
5|$|The Training and Development Centres {{service clients}} with more {{challenging}} behaviours, {{or have a}} greater degree of special needs that require continuous professional help. Extensive training is provided through a multi-disciplinary team to modify behaviours and improve independent living skills so that some <b>may</b> <b>eventually</b> be transferred to sheltered workshops or even prepared for open employment.|$|E
5|$|The marls was colonized by pioneer species, then {{shrubs and}} trees, {{corresponding}} to a primary succession. Without human intervention, a climax community would be reached. This dynamic <b>may</b> <b>eventually</b> {{lead to the}} disappearance of related open environments, particularly heritage species. However woodlands can also {{play an important role}} in creating habitat for many species. The management plan is therefore to maintain patch dynamics.|$|E
5|$|The {{player has}} a number of lives upon {{starting}} the game, and should they die a gravestone will appear at their location and stay in place as long as the player has lives left. Health can be replenished by collecting food scattered throughout the castle, however it will constantly drop the more the player moves, thus the player <b>may</b> <b>eventually</b> lose a life from starvation if they have not escaped the castle in time.|$|E
50|$|Under current plans, Ben-Gurion and Sde Dov {{airports}} <b>may</b> both <b>eventually</b> {{close and}} {{be replaced by}} a new international airport built on an artificial island off the shore of Rishon LeZion.|$|R
50|$|The American Institute of the City of New York was {{chartered}} on 2 <b>May</b> 1829. <b>Eventually,</b> the American Institute was {{merged with}} the New York Academy of Sciences (NYAS) in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The {{line has}} been {{virtually}} out-of-service since the mid-1990s. It <b>may</b> be <b>eventually</b> turned into a combined rail/trail/tourist rr operation, if current negotiations between local governmental bodies and GVT can be finalized.|$|R
5|$|The small inner moons {{constantly}} perturb each other. The {{system is}} chaotic and apparently unstable. Simulations {{show that the}} moons may perturb each other into crossing orbits, which <b>may</b> <b>eventually</b> result in collisions between the moons. Desdemona may collide with either Cressida or Juliet within the next 100million years.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{approaches}} to treating Chagas disease: antiparasitic treatment, {{to kill the}} parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms and signs of the infection. Management uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the parasympathetic nervous system. Autonomic disease imparted by Chagas <b>may</b> <b>eventually</b> result in megaesophagus, megacolon and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that explain why Chagas targets the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system and spares the sympathetic autonomic nervous system remain poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|Two main {{surgical}} procedures {{exist in the}} treatment of IIH: optic nerve sheath decompression and fenestration and shunting. Surgery would normally only be offered if medical therapy is either unsuccessful or not tolerated. The choice between these two procedures depends on the predominant problem in IIH. Neither procedure is perfect: both may cause significant complications, and both <b>may</b> <b>eventually</b> fail in controlling the symptoms. There are no randomized controlled trials to guide the decision as to which procedure is best.|$|E
50|$|Ã‰liane fell on <b>May,</b> 1st. <b>Eventually,</b> Dien Bien Phu {{surrendered}} on May 7, 1954, though Sassi's emergency column found rare Dien Bien Phu {{survivors who}} had escaped through the jungle, approximatively 150.|$|R
50|$|The College's long-held {{tradition}} of <b>May</b> Day <b>eventually</b> transitioned to <b>May</b> Court, {{a time to}} recognize seniors selected by their classmates for an honor court which occurred each year during graduation festivities.|$|R
5000|$|The Beaumont title descends to [...] "heirs of the body", {{while the}} Dukedom of Norfolk descends to [...] "heirs male". The titles <b>may</b> {{therefore}} <b>eventually</b> separate again, or the barony may go into abeyance.|$|R
5|$|A {{commonly}} studied {{variation of}} the problem involves networks of interior-disjoint smooth curves, with junctions where three {{or more of the}} curves meet. When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is well-defined for the short term. However, it <b>may</b> <b>eventually</b> reach a singular state with four or more curves meeting at a junction, and there may be {{more than one way to}} continue the flow past such a singularity.|$|E
5|$|During the Gallipoli Campaign, Burgess, now a major, {{commanded}} the 9th (Tasmanian) Battery. However, the guns of his battery were not landed until early May 1915. He {{and his men}} took over the guns of 7th Battery, allowing its personnel some rest. On 5 May, while reporting the location of Turkish artillery positions to his commander, Colonel Charles Rosenthal, he was wounded by shelling. His injuries required hospital treatment but {{he returned to the}} front on 17 <b>May.</b> <b>Eventually</b> poor health led to his evacuation from Gallipoli in October 1915. For his services during the campaign, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Promoted to lieutenant colonel in March 1916 and given command of the 3rd Australian Field Artillery Brigade, he served on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{regarding}} neuroprotective and specially regenerative treatments, such as {{stem cell}} therapy, while their research is considered of high importance {{at the moment}} they are only a promise of future therapeutic approaches. Likewise, there are not any effective treatments for the progressive variants of the disease. Many of the newest drugs {{as well as those}} under development are probably going to be evaluated as therapies for PPMS or SPMS, and their improved effectiveness when compared with previously existing drugs <b>may</b> <b>eventually</b> lead to a positive result in these groups of patients.|$|E

5|$|In October 2013, NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{announced plans}} to revisit the idea to expand the playoffs to 14 teams, with the increased revenue gained from the two additional postseason games being used to offset plans to shorten the preseason. The two extra Wild Card games could also be scheduled on the weekend, creating triple-headers on both Saturday and Sunday. Goodell then suggested that they might instead be played on Friday and/or Monday, which <b>may</b> <b>eventually</b> cause scheduling conflicts with games of the new College Football Playoff.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the criticism that NPC behavior had been too simplistic in Morrowind, Bethesda developed the Radiant A.I. system for Oblivion. NPCs were designed to make choices, rather than complete scripted routines, to achieve predetermined goals. The manner in which goals such as eating, sleeping, reading, and speaking to others are fulfilled is dependent upon the environment, the choices of other NPCs, and programmed personality values. For example, an NPC whose goal is to find food <b>may</b> <b>eventually</b> resort to stealing from others, if they are given the opportunity {{and if it is}} in their character. These development mechanics allowed Bethesda to create NPCs who could engage in complex activities.|$|E
5|$|L. ahuacaense was {{the fourth}} species of the genus Lagidium to be described, after L.peruanum, L.viscacia, and L.wolffsohni of the central and {{southern}} Andes, although more species <b>may</b> <b>eventually</b> be recognized within L.peruanum and L.viscacia, and L.wolffsohni is poorly differentiated from L.viscacia. Together with the plains viscacha (Lagostomus maximus) and the chinchillas (Chinchilla), Lagidium forms the rodent family Chinchillidae. Within Lagidium, L.ahuacaense differs by at least 7.9% from all other species in DNA sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. A cladistic analysis placed the Ecuadorian species as the sister group to all other Lagidium species, but support for this placement was not strong. Morphometric analysis also confirmed the Ecuadorian population is different from other Lagidium species.|$|E
