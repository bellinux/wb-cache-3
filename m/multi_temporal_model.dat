The development of High Density Scanner (HDS) for the generation of Digital Terrain Model (DTM) has made great progresses in objects measuring, reaching high resolutions and completeness in models reconstruction. Nowadays it is an essential tool {{that can be used}} to detect, to better classify and to monitor Terrestrial Surface Displacement (TSD). When studying terrestrial surface displacement, it becomes important to utilize quantitative techniques to develop metric <b>multi</b> <b>temporal</b> 3 D <b>models</b> of the TSD and its surroundings. Malaysia is one of the country that facing a lot of TSD event every year especially in the rainy season. Several surveying methodologies are used to investigate the activity of existing TSD: point based (Total Station, GPS) and area based techniques (Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing). The advent of affordable High Density Scanner has opened up a new opportunity in rapid TSD modeling. HDS technology is a surveying method conceived more than ten years ago that in a short time can supply DSM (Digital Surface Model) and good quality DTM as a result of elaborations with specific filtering and interpolation algorithms; only recently has this technique shown growth in development and applications. The objective of this paper is to find the applicability of High Density Scanner (HDS) for Terrestrial Surface Displacement (TSD) studies.

40|$|Event {{processing}} systems have wide applications ranging from monitoring RSS feeds to managing events from RFID readers, and there exists much work {{on them in}} the literature. Many competing <b>temporal</b> <b>models</b> for event systems have been proposed, with no consensus on which approach is best. In this paper we determine the important properties for such <b>temporal</b> <b>models.</b> Our approach is to define a very general <b>temporal</b> <b>model</b> capable of representing time {{in all of the}} major event systems. We introduce axioms motivated by the time stamp ordering relation and the semantics of the successor operator, which is present in all event systems. Only two of our axioms are controversial; the remaining axioms are satisfied by all event systems. We consider the <b>temporal</b> <b>models</b> obtained using our full set of axioms, and the models that result when {{one or the other of}} our controversial axioms is weakened.

40|$|Abstract. Time {{modeling}} is {{a crucial}} feature in many application domains. However, temporal information often is not crisp, but is uncertain, subjective and vague.

Hence, existing approaches for <b>temporal</b> <b>modeling</b> based on crisp representation of time {{cannot be applied to}} these advanced modeling tasks. To overcome these difficulties, in this paper we present fuzzy interval-based <b>temporal</b> <b>model</b> capable of representing imprecise temporal knowledge. Our approach naturally subsumes existing crisp <b>temporal</b> <b>models,</b> i. e. crisp temporal relationships are intuitively represented in our system.
