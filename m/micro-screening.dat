40|$|The {{successful}} {{application of}} crop processing on pull-type forage harvesters requires engineering analysis and experimentation {{in areas such}} as roll design, particle aerodynamic, vibration, power measurement and crop physical characterization. The first step of this research project was to design, build and evaluate two processing rolls integrated in an experimental pull-type forage harvester. With a 12. 7 mm theoretical length of cut setting, the processing rolls were used to treat alfalfa at a 1 mm clearance between the rolls. Samples analyzed at an animal research centre showed that processing increased the effective ruminal degradability of corn by 3 % but did not improve the degradability of alfalfa. The presence of processing rolls in the forage harvester increased friction. The air inlet area had to be increased to improve particle flow and obtain maximum air outlet speed. The presence of crop processing rolls required an increase in blower speed of 10 to 20 % to maintain the throwing capacity. Critical speeds were analyzed by the Transfer Matrix Component Mode Syntheses (TMCMS) method and three classical approaches using analytical models to predict deflections in the shaft. Experiments showed that the TMCMS method was very reliable and predicted the critical speed with an error of about 4 % compared to 8 % or higher for classical methods. Modal analysis also proved to be a simple and practical way to measure critical speed. A laboratory setup was built to investigate various mechanical adjustments: roll clearances of 4 and 6 mm for corn, and 1 and 3 mm for grass; eight peripheral speed ratios between 1. 08 and 1. 93; two levels of throughput (9 and 18 t fresh crop/h). Optimal adjustment will ultimately depend on animal response to various levels of crop breakage. A hydrodynamic model of chopped forage processed between rolls was developed to determine crop properties using an experimental database and subsequently predict the power requirement {{as a function of the}} configuration. Forage specific area was estimated using an experimental <b>micro-screening</b> method. A program was developed to calculate mechanical stresses within each roll of the crop processor as a function of working conditions and steel properties. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|Microbiological {{screening}} of antimicrobial residues in eggs needs special attention {{because of the}} high level of naturally occurring inhibitors contained in eggs which often lead to false positive results. However, it was discovered that heating egg samples at 800 C for 10 minutes inactivated the inhibitors. The new bacteriological screening test for antimicrobial residues in eggs which was developed during this study, contains viable spores of Geobacillus stearothermophilus which are sensitive to antimicrobial residues including beta-lactams, tetracycline’s and macrolides. The new test method was validated based on the comparison with a reference method, namely the Kundrat <b>micro-screening</b> four-plate test, 1 and published literature of another standard reference method, the Premi®Test. A preliminary trial was conducted on 36 hens that were given therapeutic oral doses of overthe- counter antimicrobials daily for seven days with one of eleven antimicrobials based on the manufacturer’s recommendations. Eggs were collected from the hens during and after treatment and tested for {{the presence or absence of}} antimicrobial residues. Several performance criteria and minimum detection concentrations were estimated and discussed. Some agreements and differences were found between the new and the reference tests with the new test being more sensitive to beta-lactams, tetracyclines and macrolides than the Kundrat and Premi®Test on the average. The use of florfenicol and norfloxacin in laying hens is banned and therefore there are no maximum residue limits (MRL) or published Premi®Test values. For meat, the MRL is 100 mg/kg. It was therefore concluded that the new screening test could be used for routine {{screening of}} antimicrobial residues in eggs. A two seasonal survey was also conducted to determine the prevalence of antimicrobial residues in commercial chicken eggs in Tshwane area of Gauteng Province, South Africa. Although the season did not impact statistically on the antibiotic residues found in the eggs; eggs sold at the roadside (informal businesses), certain egg brands, and those sold at lower prices were found to be more likely to contain antibiotic residues than those obtained from formal outlets and at higher prices.

40|$|A novel {{emulsification}} {{technique has}} been developed for high throughput production of uniform emulsion droplets using high porosity oscillating stainless steel wire woven <b>micro-screen.</b> Different surfactants were investigated including dispersed/continuous bi-surfactant systems using Span 80 /SDS and Span 80 /Tween 20. The effects of oscillation amplitude and frequency {{as well as the}} dispersed phase flux on emulsion average droplet size and uniformity were investigated. It was found that the droplet average size decreased with increasing the surface sheer stress. The emulsion droplet uniformity determined using the coefficient of variation (CV) changed with oscillations such that there was an optimal oscillating frequency for each amplitude where the CV was smallest. Furthermore, it was also found that both droplet size and uniformity were influenced by the content of surfactants and that the effect of process conditions was stronger for Span 80 /SDS system than for Span 80 /Tween 20 system. The experimental data were fitted satisfactorily using shear stress function with R 2 value of 0. 97. Inserts were used to narrow the width of the continuous phase container and to build geometric channels. The flat surface inserts, the wavy surface inserts and the inserts with baffles have been studied. The results show that the droplet size decreased and the size distribution was widened. In the respect of monodispersion, the continuous phase channels with various geometries have detrimental influences in the oscillatory <b>micro-screen</b> emulsification system...|$|R

The company's patented EnhancedView technology uses a unique optoelectronic device based on a semi-reflective diopter with a mathematically calculated curve enabling the reflection of a virtual collimated image directly into the wearer's field of view. The use of EnhancedView technology, coupled with an OLED <b>micro-screen</b> provides a 40 ° x 30 ° (H x V) field of vision with a resolution of 800 x 600 pixels or more. This is equivalent to viewing a floating screen of 90 cm diagonal at a distance of one meter. It is the result of an intensive collaborative development work with the Institut d'Optique and the University of Paris-Sud over several years.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{was aimed at}} developing a technology to combine the production of useful microfungi with the treatment of wastewater from food processing. A recycle bioreactor equipped with a <b>micro-screen</b> was developed as a wastewater treatment system on a laboratory scale to contain a Rhizopus culture and maintain its dominance under non-aseptic conditions. Competitive growth of bacteria was observed, but this was minimised by manipulation of the solids retention time and the hydraulic retention time. Removal of about 90 % of the waste organic material (as BOD) from the wastewater was achieved simultaneously. Since essentially all fungi are retained behind the 100 mum aperture screen, the solids retention time could be controlled by the rate of harvesting. The hydraulic retention time was employed to control the bacterial growth as the bacteria were washed through the screen at a short HRT. A steady state model was developed to determine these two parameters. This model predicts the effluent quality. Experimental work is still needed to determine the growth characteristics of the selected fungal species under optimum conditions (pH and temperature) ...|$|R
40|$|Agro-industries are a life-line for {{sustainable}} future of human kind. However, the wastewater generated by agro-industries poses {{direct threat to}} the same sustainable future by polluting the freshwater sources when discharged into those freshwater sources. Thus, we need both advanced treatment technologies to treat those wastewater streams generated and better reuse practices for the treated effluents. Reverse osmosis (RO) {{is one of the}} advanced treatments to treat dissolved solids that are present in agricultural wastewater streams. But, RO is very sensitive to suspended solids (SS) present in the wastewater streams. Those SS can foul the RO membrane and make it ineffective in producing treated effluent at desired rates. Therefore, suitable pre-treatment scheme is necessary to treat the agro-wastewater streams before passing through RO. This study focuses on the qualitative and quantitative ranking of the available conventional and modern pre-treatment technologies as pre-treatment for RO. This study considers wastewater that has been treated through a secondary treatment system for example activated sludge process as the target water that needs pre-treatment. Based on qualitative ranking of conventional pre-treatment options, the Lime clarification/Granular Media filtration (GMF) option is ranked as the best; whereas finescreens/ <b>micro-screens</b> option ranked as the least preferred option based on the scores they attained in treating the water quality parameters that are considered essential. Based on the quantitative ranking, the low pressure membrane technology such as ultra-filtration (UF) stood first and microfiltration (MF) stood last...|$|R
5000|$|Sykes {{was elected}} a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1997. His {{nominations}} reads [...] Richard Sykes is distinguished {{both as an}} experimental scientist and as {{a major force in}} the British pharmaceutical industry. He has, in his own right, made important experimental contributions to microbiology, of which the best known are his work on B-lactamases, and the discovery of the first monocyclic B-lactam antibiotic, aztreonam. The latter was not an accidental finding or simply the outcome of routine screening. Sykes was personally responsible for the development of imaginative new <b>micro-screens</b> of much greater sensitivity than those in use in the antibiotic industry at the time, and these ultra-sensitive screens enabled him to detect compounds present in trace amounts that were not detectable by standard methods. Aztreonam proved to be a major advance in the treatment of gram-negative infections. In 1986 Sykes rejoined Glaxo where he is now Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive of Glaxo Holdings plc. His influence within Glaxo and the pharmaceutical industry generally has been marked by a firm conviction of the overriding importance of good fundamental science, and this has found expression not only in the massive development of Glaxo R and D, but also in the vigorous interaction of the company with the university sector in the United Kingdom. He also makes a significant positive contribution to national science policy. The case for the election of Richard Sykes as a general candidate is very strong.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Northeastern U. S. has {{the ideal}} {{location}} and {{unique opportunity to}} be a leader in cold water marine finfish aquaculture. However, problems and regulations on environmental issues, mandatory stocking of 100 % native North American salmon, and disease have impacted economic viability of the U. S. salmon industry. In response to these problems, the USDA ARS developed the National Cold Water Marine Aquaculture Center (NCWMAC) in Franklin, Maine. The NCWMAC is adjacent to the University of Maine Center for Cooperative Aquaculture Research on the shore of Taunton Bay and shares essential infrastructure to maximize efficiency. Facilities are used to conduct research on Atlantic salmon and other cold water marine finfish species. The initial research focus for the Franklin location is to develop a comprehensive Atlantic salmon breeding program from native North American fish stocks leading to the development and release of genetically improved salmon to commercial producers. The Franklin location has unique ground water resources to supply freshwater, brackish water, salt water or filtered seawater to fish culture tanks. Research facilities include office space, primary and secondary hygiene rooms, and research tank bays for culturing 200 + Atlantic salmon families with incubation, parr, smolt, on-grow, and broodstock tanks. Tank sizes are 0. 14 m 3 for parr, 9 m 3 for smolts, and 36, 46 and 90 m 3 for subadults and broodfish. Culture tanks are equipped with recirculating systems utilizing biological (fluidized sand) filtration, carbon dioxide stripping, supplemental oxygenation and ozonation, and ultraviolet sterilization. Water from the research facility discharges into a wastewater treatment building and passes through <b>micro-screen</b> drum filtration, an inclined traveling belt screen to exclude all eggs or fish from the discharge, and UV irradiation to disinfect the water. The facility was completed in June 2007, and all water used in the facility has been from groundwater sources. Mean facility discharge has been approximately 0. 50 m 3 /min (130 gpm). The facility was designed for stocking densities of 20 – 47 kg/m 3 and a maximum biomass of 26, 000 kg. The maximum system density obtained from June 2007 through January 2008 has approached 40 kg/m 3, maximum facility biomass was 11, 021 kg, water exchange rates have typically been 2 – 3 % of the recirculating system flow rate, and tank temperatures have ranged from a high of 15. 4 °C in July to a low of 6. 6 °C in January 2008 without supplemental heating or cooling...|$|R
