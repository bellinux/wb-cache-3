40|$|AbstractA {{boundary}} value problem {{in the case of}} the second order axi-symmetric Young–Laplace differential equation (some of whose solutions describe the static <b>meniscus</b> <b>free</b> surface, i. e. the static liquid bridge free surface between the shaper and the crystal, occurring in single crystal rod growth) is analyzed. The analysis concerns the dependence of the solution of an initial value problem of the equation on a parameter p (the controllable part of the pressure difference Δp across the free surface). Inequalities are established for p which are necessary or sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution which represents a stable and convex free surface of a static meniscus. The analysis is numerically illustrated for the static menisci occurring in the NdYAG laser single crystal rod growth from the melt by edge-defined film-fed growth (E. F. G.) technique.

40|$|A {{new method}} for the direct {{molecular}} mass determination from sedimentation velocity experiments is presented. It {{is based on}} a nonlinear least squares fitting procedure of the concentration profiles and simultaneous estimation of the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients using approximate solutions of the Lamm equation. A computer program, LAMM, was written by using five different model functions derived by Fujita (1962, 1975) to describe the sedimentation of macromolecules during centrifugation. To compare the usefulness of these equations for the analysis of hydrodynamic results, the approach was tested on data sets of Claverie simulations as well as experimental curves of some proteins. A modification for one of the model functions is suggested, leading to more reliable sedimentation and diffusion coefficients estimated by the fitting procedure. The method seems useful for the rapid molecular mass determination of proteins larger than 10 kDa. One of the equations of the Archibald type is also suitable for compounds of low molecular mass, probably less than 10 kDa, because this model function requires neither the plateau region nor a <b>meniscus</b> <b>free</b> of solute...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In the <b>casting</b> technology, defect <b>free</b> <b>casting</b> {{had been}} the primary goal since the {{inception}} of the technology. However in the present casting arena, emphasis on the precise and defect <b>free</b> <b>casting</b> has got greatly increased due to energy saving, environmental and economy considerations apart from the stringent product quality standard requirements. In order to achieve this level, computer simulation is inevitably necessary. FEM based simulation software is used to find solidification related defects specially shrinkage porosity very precisely. In the present work ANSYS, an FEM based versatile software has been used for hot spots identification in a two feeder system. The feeders have been designed and optimized. ANSYS has been used for transient thermal analysis and then optimization process has been performed. Path of two feeder optimization for steel sand casting on ANSYS have been searched. Conductive and convective heat transfer has been taken in to consideration. The whole process is performed using traditional modulus approach also. The results are compared. The comparison reveals that ANSYS optimizer provides better results for casting having two feeders. It saves material and energy thus resulting into economy and environmental benefits too. Hence it may be recommended as superior over modulus approach for two feeder system in sand casting...|$|R

40|$|During {{crystal growth}} in the {{vertical}} Bridgman process, both the melt and the growing crystal are {{in contact with the}} ampoule wall. The different thermal coefficients of expansion of the crystal and the ampoule wall can lead to stresses, crystal defects, and not rarely to cracks and/or polycrystalline {{growth in the}} crystal. The detached Bridgman process is characterized {{by the fact that the}} melt <b>meniscus</b> <b>frees</b> itself from the ampoule wall and the crystal can be grown without wall contact with the ampoule. After the effect of detachment was observed due to the reduced force of gravity during the early experiments under microgravity conditions, in the past few years the Bridgman process likewise has been successfully used to grow at least partially detached under 1 g-condition. If the requirements for detaching the melt meniscus from the ampoule wall are not fulfilled by the material-specific parameters (like e. g. wetting behavior between ampoule and melt and the growth angle of the crystal), detachment can be obtained also by the imposition of suitable pressure ratios in the growth ampoule. In the context of this paper, the growth of germanium by the detached and vertical Bridgman processes in pyrolytic boron nitride crucibles will be reported, Typical gap widths between ampoule wall and detached grown crystals are approximately 10 - 50 microns. Compared to the crystals grown with wall contact, a reduction of the etch pit density of approximately two orders of magnitude could be obtained by growing with the detached process...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{meniscus}} deformation and flow in an isothermal liquid bridge maintained between two circular rods, when one rod {{is subject to}} axial monochromatic vibrations. It concerns a fundamental aspect {{of the problem of}} crystal growth from melt by the floating-zone technique which is often considered in weightlessness conditions. In the absence of vibrations the bridge is cylindrical; but due to vibration the mean shape of the meniscus is no more cylindrical and the meniscus oscillates around this mean shape. Two models are developed. First, we take into account the pulsating deformations of the <b>meniscus</b> (<b>free</b> surface), but we assume that the mean shape of meniscus remains cylindrical (i. e., we neglect the influence of vibration on this mean shape). For this simple case, a solution of the problem for the pulsating meniscus deformations and the pulsating velocity field is found in explicit form. For the mean flow, the problem is solved numerically by a finite-difference method. The calculations demonstrate the contribution of two basic mechanisms of mean flow generation due to vibrations, related to the generation of mean vorticity in the viscous boundary layer near the rigid boundaries and surface-wave propagation at a free surface. The intensity of the mean flow induced by surface waves is found to be sharply increasing when the vibration frequency approaches the resonance values that are determined from the explicit form of the solution of pulsation problem. In the second model, we take into account both pulsating and mean deformations of the meniscus. The governing equations for the potential of pulsating velocity and mean velocity, and for the pressure, are solved by using a finite-difference method and a boundary-fitted curvilinear coordinate system fitting the free surface...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Significant {{amount of}} cast iron {{are being used to}} {{fabricate}} components such as engine blocks, cylinder heads etc., in response to consumer demands for the increase in performance with excellent cast ability and machinability, the use {{of cast iron}} has grown dramatically from the past. Production of cast iron castings is a complex process which involves many parameters that affect the quality of castings. In this study, a new approach is attempted to produce sound FG 260 grey iron castings by computer simulation through experimental validation in a cast iron foundry. The entire casting process is simulated by means of finite element simulation software and then the results are compared with shop floor trials. A simple rectangular plate casting of dimension 200 x 100 x 15 mm is produced with different combinations of riser dimensions. The aim is to increase the yield as well as to reduce defects that occur in the cast iron castings due to design parameters for which a cylindrical riser of hemispherical bottom with h/d= 1. 3 is considered for analysis. Solidification simulation is made with ANSYS software to compute solidification time and optimal riser combinations to obtain defect free castings in the shop floor. The experimental results revealed that the simulation performed using ANSYS holds good to produce defect <b>free</b> <b>cast</b> iron castings in the foundry...|$|R
