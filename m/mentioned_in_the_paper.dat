Colladon, of Geneva, {{considered}} {{that the difference}} {{might be due to}} the use of insufficient quantities of common electricity in all the experiments before made on this head; and in a memoir read to the Academie des Sciences in 1826[A], describes experiments, in which, by the use of a battery, points, and a delicate galvanometer, he succeeded in obtaining deflections, and thus establishing identity in that respect. MM. Arago, Ampère, and Savary, are <b>mentioned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> as having witnessed a successful repetition of the experiments. But as no other one has come forward in confirmation, MM. Arago, Ampère, and Savary, not having themselves published (that I am aware of) their admission of the results, and as some {{have not been able to}} obtain them, M. Colladon's conclusions have been occasionally doubted or denied; and an important point with me was to establish their accuracy, or remove them entirely from the body of received experimental research. I am happy to say that my results fully confirm those by M. Colladon, and I should have had no occasion to describe them, but that they are essential as proofs of the accuracy of the final and general conclusions I am enabled to draw respecting the magnetic and chemical action of electricity (360. 366. 367. 377. &c.).|$|E

5000|$|Although Fibonacci heaps {{look very}} efficient, {{they have the}} {{following}} two drawbacks (as <b>mentioned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> [...] "The Pairing Heap: A new form of Self Adjusting Heap"): [...] "They are complicated {{when it comes to}} coding them. Also they are not as efficient in practice when compared with the theoretically less efficient forms of heaps, since in their simplest version they require storage and manipulation of four pointers per node, compared to the two or three pointers per node needed for other structures [...] ". These other structures are referred to Binary heap, Binomial heap, Pairing Heap, Brodal Heap and Rank Pairing Heap.|$|E
5000|$|The string {{verification}} {{work over}} a slow communication channel shows a powerful computing application where the methods is inherently based on calculating the hash function.

It is also {{interesting to note that the}} superposition of the first D(N) [...] 2N integer numbers can be produced with only 2N operations, which the authors call [...] "Achilles ankle operation" [...] in the paper.|$|E

Sulzberger agreed with her argument and the paper started using the term Ms. as stated in an editor's note published on June 20, 1986, citing the fact that the term had [...] "become a part of the language" [...] in its decision to change its policy. She remained involved with the Morris County, New Jersey chapter of the National Organization for Women until her death.|$|E

50|$|In the {{juvenile}} mandible of Lufengpithecus, the superior {{part of the}} anterior surface and the vertical implantation of the anterior teeth are {{a lot like the}} adults of the same species. Additionally, {{the juvenile}} and the adult species have these features in common with early Homo species and early great apes. The superior transverse torus is more prominent and developed in the adult species whereas the juvenile (PA869) has a less developed superior transverse torus. In the juvenile and the adult species the lateral prominences are separated into two branches which are only similar in a single orangutan species (based off the species discussed in the paper) and not related to humans. In the juvenile there are double mental foramina on the corpora whereas the adult species and every other species <b>mentioned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> have single mental foramina. Results indicates that the corpus of juvenile mandible of Lufengpithecus possessed the basic structural framework of the adult mandible of same species and other species such as Sivapithecus, Australopithecus, early Homo, but possess a different framework from modern humans.|$|E
50|$|Snowball {{sampling}} is a recruitment {{method that}} employs research into participants' social networks to access specific populations. According to research <b>mentioned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> written by Kath Browne, using social networks to research is accessible. In this research, Kath Browne used social networks to research non-heterosexual women. Snowball sampling {{is often used}} because the population under investigation is hard to approachable either due to low numbers of potential participants or {{the sensitivity of the}} topic. The author indicated the recruitment technique of snowball sampling, which uses interpersonal relations and connections within people.Due to the use of social networks and interpersonal relations, snowball sampling forms how individuals act and interact in focus groups, couple interviews and interviews. As a result, snowball sampling not only results in the recruitment of particular samples, use of this technique produces participants'accounts of their lives. To help mitigate these risks, it is important to not rely on any one single method of sampling to gather data about a target sector. In order to most accurately obtain information, a company must do everything it possibly can to ensure that the sampling is controlled. Also, it is imperative that the correct personnel is used to execute the actual sampling, because one missed opportunity could skew the results.|$|E
