5|$|At {{that time}} there was dispute {{regarding}} the difference between rational numbers and irrational numbers {{and there was no}} consistency {{in the way in which}} decimal fractions were represented. In 1586, Simon Stevin published a small pamphlet called De Thiende ("the tenth") which historians credit as being the basis of modern notation for decimal fractions. Stevin felt that this innovation was so significant that he declared the universal introduction of decimal coinage, <b>measures,</b> <b>and</b> weights to be merely a question of time.|$|E

Then, the communication protocol and hardware structure of the multi-computer communication system based on wireless transmission were mainly studied. And software design technology of multi-parameter <b>measure</b> <b>and</b> control system was studied in succession. Finally, the five-parameter-combined environment testing was carried out. The experimental results show that the <b>measure</b> <b>and</b> control tasks of the combined environment testing can be well finished by the multi-parameter <b>measure</b> <b>and</b> control system...|$|R
