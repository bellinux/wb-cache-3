The cover photo also shows a <b>metal</b> <b>bracket</b> on the side of Tittle's helmet which served to protect his face by preventing the helmet from caving in. The 1954 cover was the first of four Sports Illustrated covers he graced during his career.|$|E
25|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 20 October 1919 an accident occurred on the man engine at the Levant Mine, St Just, Cornwall. More than 100 miners were on the engine being drawn to the surface when a <b>metal</b> <b>bracket</b> {{at the top of}} the rod broke. The heavy timbers crashed down the shaft, carrying the side platforms with them, and 31 men died. The man engine was not replaced and the lowest levels of the mine were abandoned.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} full-length full-height PCI card (also {{known as}} full-size) is specified as {{a length of}} 312mm (12.283inches) and a height of 107mm (4.2inches). However, most modern PCI cards are half-length or smaller (see below) and many modern PC cases cannot accommodate {{the length of a}} full-size card. Note, this length is the length of the printed circuit board; it does not include the angled short leg of the <b>metal</b> <b>bracket</b> (which does affect e.g. packaging dimensions). Some high power PCI products have active cooling systems that extend past the nominal dimensions. Likewise, some may take up more than one slot space: these are referred to as double-wide or triple-wide cards, accordingly.|$|E
30|$|Thus, {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} shear strength of <b>metal</b> <b>brackets</b> attached with different dental composites and enamel roughness after debonding and finishing. The null hypotheses were that the shear strength of <b>metal</b> <b>brackets</b> would not differ among groups of teeth treated with different dental composites (1), and that the surface roughness of enamel after debonding and finishing would not differ between groups nor between the treated and sound enamel not subjected to bonding of the <b>metal</b> <b>brackets</b> (2).|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{find out}} effect of <b>metal</b> <b>brackets</b> on the {{epithelial}} {{cells of the}} buccal mucosa as compared to normal mucosa without any brackets. Patients and Methods: Oral mucosal smears were obtained for patients visited for orthodontic treatment using a cytobrush. The study group consisted of P 1 : patients with no brackets, P 2 : 60 days after placement of <b>metal</b> <b>brackets,</b> P 3 : 30 days after removal of brackets. 30 individuals of both sexes who are undergoing fixed appliance theropy with bonded brackets were selected. With the use of exfoliative cytology, morphometric and morphologic changes in buccal mucosa cells adjacent to these brackets were determined and were compared at three points. Results: A decrease in nuclear area {{and an increase in}} cytoplasmic area occurred in the buccal mucosa cells adjacent to the brackets at P 2. At P 3, this altered morphometry persisted only in cells adjacent to the <b>metal</b> <b>brackets,</b> although to a lesser degree than at P 2. A greater decrease in nuclear area was noted in cells adjacent to the <b>metal</b> <b>brackets</b> than in those for patients P 1. At all time points, smears of cells appeared normal or normal with some inflammatory changes. Conclusion: Placement of <b>metal</b> <b>brackets</b> in the buccal cavity induces cellular alterations. These alterations do not suggest malignancy...|$|R

2500|$|Reyat {{would later}} testify that he {{travelled}} by ferry from Duncan to Vancouver that morning {{to work on}} his brother's truck. Phone records show someone called from his residence in Duncan to Johal's number at 10:50am and 4:00pm later that day. Reyat was seen in the company of another East Indian man at the Auto Marine Electric store in Burnaby, near Parmar's house, between 10:00am and 11:30am. He bought two 12 volt batteries similar to the one used in the explosive device tested in the woods, and they were to fit into a special <b>metal</b> <b>bracket</b> he had brought with him. Constable Clark-Marlowe later believed there was [...] "ample time for Inderjit Singh Reyat to obtain the batteries at the Auto Marine Electric limited store in Burnaby, incorporate the batteries in the assembly of an explosive device and then have the device transported in a suitcase to the Vancouver airport".|$|E

With this system, {{there is}} a metal or plastic {{hemisphere}} mounted {{on the end of}} the downrod; this hemisphere rests in a ceiling-mounted <b>metal</b> <b>bracket</b> and allows the fan to move freely (which is very useful on vaulted ceilings). Some companies have come up with slight modifications of this design.|$|E
30|$|A large {{artifact}} {{was observed}} {{over the entire}} oral region around orthodontic appliances, altering regional visibility. The velopharyngeal height was measured as significantly longer {{in the presence of}} <b>metal</b> <b>brackets.</b> The maximum artifact size due to a metallic bracket was >[*] 8  cm. Our results show that even if it is possible to obtain the measurements of palate length, nasion to sella, and nasion to basion in individuals wearing <b>metal</b> <b>brackets</b> for molars, the measurements might be affected due to the presence of artifacts.|$|R

30|$|Significant {{differences}} in the shear strength after of <b>metal</b> <b>brackets</b> were found among different dental composites (1) and in the surface roughness between the areas of sound enamel and the areas that were finished after debonding of <b>metal</b> <b>brackets</b> (2). The low shrinkage composites achieved low but acceptable SBS results. Evaluation of the surface roughness of enamel after finishing showed no advantages or disadvantages {{to any of the}} bonding materials tested using the methods employed in this study. However, other factors, such as the application of force, biofilm retention, micro leakage, and light reflection should be tested in future studies of low shrinkage composites.|$|R

40|$|Background: Different {{in-vitro}} {{studies have}} reported various results regarding shear bond strength (SBS) of orthodontic brackets when SEP technique is compared to conventional system. This in-vivo {{study was designed to}} compare the effect of conventional acid-etching and self-etching primer adhesive (SEP) systems on SBS and debonding characteristics of metal and ceramic orthodontic brackets. Material and Methods: 120 intact first maxillary and mandibular premolars of 30 orthodontic patients were selected and bonded with <b>metal</b> and ceramic <b>brackets</b> using conventional acid-etch or self-etch primer system. The bonded brackets were incorporated into the wire during the study period to simulate the real orthodontic treatment condition. The teeth were extracted and debonded after 30 days. The SBS, debonding characteristics and adhesive remnant indices (ARI) were determined in all groups. Results: The mean SBS of <b>metal</b> <b>brackets</b> was 10. 63 ± 1. 42 MPa in conventional and 9. 38 ± 1. 53 MPa in SEP system, (P = 0. 004). No statistically significant difference was noted between conventional and SEP systems in ceramic brackets. The frequency of 1, 2 and 3 ARI scores and debonding within the adhesive were the most common among all groups. No statistically significant difference was observed regarding ARI or failure mode of debonded speci mens in different brackets or bonding systems. Conclusions: The SBS of <b>metal</b> <b>brackets</b> bonded using conventional system was significantly higher than SEP system, although the SBS of SEP system was clinically acceptable. No significant difference was found between conventional and SEP systems used with ceramic brackets. Total SBS of <b>metal</b> <b>brackets</b> was significantly higher than ceramic brackets. Due to adequate SBS of SEP system in bonding the <b>metal</b> <b>brackets,</b> it can be used as an alternative for conventional system...|$|R
50|$|Bookends {{can be an}} {{important}} consideration in home decor. Some bookends are made of bronze, marble, wood and even large geodes. Elaborate and decorative bookends are not uncommon. In libraries, simple <b>metal</b> <b>brackets</b> are often used to support the end of a row of books.|$|R
30|$|Sixteen healthy {{young adults}} (nine males, seven females; average age, 27  years) with normal {{occlusion}} were recruited. Four types of customized maxillary and mandibular plates were prepared by incorporating {{one of the}} following into the plate: (a) nothing, (b) a fixed canine-to-canine retainer, (c) <b>metal</b> <b>brackets</b> for the anterior and molar teeth, or (d) clear brackets for the anterior teeth and <b>metal</b> <b>brackets</b> for molars. A 3 -T MRI movie, in segmented cine mode, was generated for each plate condition while participants pronounced a vowel-consonant-vowel syllable (/asa/). The size of the artifact due to the metallic brackets was measured. The face size and orthodontically important anatomical structures, such as the velum, the hard palate, and the laryngeal ventricle, were also measured.|$|R
5000|$|Traditional metal wired braces are {{stainless-steel}} and {{are sometimes}} used {{in combination with}} titanium. Traditional metal braces {{are the most common}} type of braces. These braces have a <b>metal</b> <b>bracket</b> with elastic (rubber band) ties holding the wire onto the metal brackets. The second-most common type of braces are self-ligating braces that do not require elastic ties. Instead, the wire goes through the bracket. Often with this type of braces, treatment time is reduced, there is less pain on the teeth, and fewer adjustments are required than with traditional braces.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} full-length full-height PCI card (also {{known as}} full-size) is specified as {{a length of}} 312 mm (12.283 inches) and a height of 107 mm (4.2 inches). However, most modern PCI cards are half-length or smaller (see below) and many modern PC cases cannot accommodate {{the length of a}} full-size card. Note, this length is the length of the printed circuit board; it does not include the angled short leg of the <b>metal</b> <b>bracket</b> (which does affect e.g. packaging dimensions). Some high power PCI products have active cooling systems that extend past the nominal dimensions. Likewise, some may take up more than one slot space: these are referred to as double-wide or triple-wide cards, accordingly.|$|E
50|$|The {{front fairing}} of the VF1000R was {{split into two}} pieces. These both {{attached}} to a <b>metal</b> <b>bracket</b> which ran {{around the perimeter of}} the engine. The lower fairing was held on primarily by the use of 6 quarter-turn, race type fasteners (3 per side) with the aid of 4 traditional bolts (2 per side). The bolts which held the lower fairing on at the connection to the upper fairing also went through holes in the upper fairing in order to ensure proper panel gaps and alignment. On models from 1985 and later, the lower fairing also featured spring-loaded vent doors which could be opened and closed in order to cool the engine and rider during high temperature conditions.|$|E
30|$|The {{course of}} active {{orthodontic}} treatment ranged between 10 and 12 [*]months. Only elastic ligatures were used. The patients were controlled every 4 [*]weeks. Brackets with bond failures and brackets with tie-wing fractures were replaced with <b>metal</b> <b>brackets.</b> Patients were informed about this procedure {{before the beginning}} of treatment.|$|R

50|$|For most Tandy 1000 models (other {{than the}} compact EX and HX) {{that did not}} come already {{equipped}} with a hard drive, Tandy offered hard disk options {{in the form of}} hardcards that were installed in one of the computer's expansion slots and consisted of a controller and drive (typically a 3.5-inch MFM or RLL unit with a Western Digital controller) mounted together on a <b>metal</b> <b>bracket.</b> Although this arrangement provided a neat physical coupling between the controller and the disk, single-sector internal transfers and dependence on the speed of the host machine to transfer data to memory meant that a trial-and-error approach was still needed to set the disk interleave correctly to ensure optimum transfer rates. Even then, transfer rates could be as low as 40 KB/s for 8088 and 8086 machines.|$|E
50|$|Fire-tube boilers {{sometimes}} have water-tubes as well, {{to increase the}} heating surface. A Cornish boiler may have several water-tubes across {{the diameter of the}} flue (this is common in steam launches). A locomotive boiler with a wide firebox may have arch tubes or thermic syphons. As firebox technology developed, it was found that placing a baffle of firebricks (heat-resistant bricks) inside the firebox to direct the flow of hot flue gasses up into the top of the firebox before it flowed into the fire tubes increased efficiency by equalizing the heat between upper and lower fire tubes. To hold these in place, a <b>metal</b> <b>bracket</b> was used, but to prevent these brackets from burning and eroding away they were built as water tubes, with cool water {{from the bottom of the}} boiler moving upwards by convection as it heated, and carrying the heat away before the metal reached its failure temperature.|$|E
50|$|The same {{materials}} and similar details continue {{around to the}} south elevation. The employees entrance is located {{near the center of}} the first floor. The eight-story block of the south elevation features a wide, vertical band of windows near its west end and a punched four-story window opening which constitutes nearly two-thirds of the elevation's wall surface. The windows are divided horizontally by metal spandrels and mullions. The top floor of the eight-story block is fully glazed and sheltered under a projecting metal canopy. A four-story <b>metal</b> <b>bracket</b> appears to support the cantilevered canopy. The 16-story tower is set back from the plane of the eight-story block, allowing for the open-air rooftop terrace. The tower's elevation consists of a limestone center shaft flanked by glass and steel curtain walls. The limestone wall surface has punched window openings of horizontal bands and small squares. The curtain walls are divided horizontally by projecting fins at the floor plates and intermediate window mullions. The vaulted metal roof crowns the tower.|$|E
