50|$|Hounding Whip, {{the media}} catches him drunk after he spontaneously drives {{to the home}} of his ex-wife and son, both of whom resent him. He stays with Charlie until the NTSB hearing, vowing not to drink. The night before the hearing, Charlie and Hugh move Whip to a guarded hotel room with no alcohol. Although his minibar is empty, he finds the door to an {{adjacent}} room unlocked and raids its minibar instead. Charlie and Hugh discover Whip the next morning, passed out drunk and bleeding from his forehead. With less than an hour to go until the NTSB hearing, Harling is called to revive Whip with cocaine. Lead NTSB investigator Ellen <b>Block</b> (<b>Melissa</b> Leo) explains that a damaged elevator assembly jackscrew due for replacement was the primary cause of the crash, having finally failed and forced the elevator into a fixed forward position. Ellen commends Whip for his intervention, noting that in a simulated environment no other pilot was able to perform as diligently as he did. Ellen asks Whip if he had consumed any alcohol or drugs in the three {{days leading up to the}} crash, which Whip denies doing.|$|R
40|$|Several {{natural or}} {{synthetic}} chemicals have been indicated as potential thyroid disruptors. The development of in vitro assays has been recommended to comprehensively assess the potential thyroid disrupting activity of a substance or a complex mixture. In this study, 12 substances suspected for acting as thyroid disruptors were tested {{for their ability}} to inhibit TSH-stimulated cAMP production in vitro. Those substances producing an inhibition were further studied to establish the level at which they interfere with this step of thyroid cell function. Using Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) transfected with the recombinant human TSH receptor, a dose-dependent inhibition of TSH-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was produced by 1, 1 -bis-(4 -chlorphenyl) - 2, 2, 2 -trichloroethan (DDT), Aroclor 1254 and Melissa Officinalis. All three substances also inhibited the cAMP production stimulated by TSH receptor antibody. Melissa Officinalis produced a significant inhibition of TSH binding to its receptor and of antibody binding to TSH, while no significant changes were produced by Aroclor 1254 or DDT in these assays. These data suggest that principles contained in <b>Melissa</b> Officinalis may <b>block</b> the binding of TSH to its receptor by acting both on the hormone and the receptor itself, while DDT and Aroclor 1254 affect cAMP production mainly at post-receptor step. In conclusion, we have developed a set of in vitro assays that allow investigation into the effect of thyroid disruptors on the TSH-mediated activation of the cAMP cascade. These assays may be useful to identify the mechanism of action of thyroid disruptors, coming beside and supporting animal studies or epidemiological surveys...|$|R

5000|$|The {{incident}} prompted editorials from a {{range of}} journalists including <b>Melissa</b> <b>Block</b> of NPR's All Things Considered, Zachary Hunchar of Technorati, and CNN's Eatocracy. Journalist Ivor Tossell opined that this may be the first major Facebook-based internet vigilantism where many participants used their real names instead of remaining anonymous. He noted that Griggs resembled a cartoonish [...] "pantomime villain", and her passive-aggressive attitude, and not the infringement itself, caused the response. TechRepublic offered tips to avoid having one's online work used without credit. One author compared the incident to the 2008 sourcing dispute that led to the demise of The Bulletin, a small Texas alternative weekly. [...] Glenn Fleishman wrote that [...] "regardless of the provenance of the email, it was scary to watch the net awake as one." ...|$|E

5000|$|On 22 June 2009, {{when news}} came that New York Times {{reporter}} David Rohde had escaped from his Taliban captors, few {{knew he had}} even been kidnapped, because for the seven months he and two Afghan colleagues were in the Taliban's hands, The Times kept that information under wraps. Out {{of concern for the}} reporter's safety, The Times asked other major news organizations to do the same; NPR was among dozens of news outlets that did not report on the kidnapping at the urging of Rohde's colleagues. Kelly McBride, who teaches ethics to journalists at the Poynter Institute, says she was [...] "really astounded" [...] by the media blackout. [...] "I find it a little disturbing, because it makes me wonder what else 40 international news organizations have agreed not to tell the public," [...] she tells NPR's <b>Melissa</b> <b>Block.</b> McBride says the blackout could hurt the credibility of news organizations. [...] "I don't think we do ourselves any favors long term for our credibility when we have a total news blackout on something that's clearly of interest to the public," [...] she says.|$|E
5000|$|Fried's fifth book, titled Appetite for America: How Visionary Businessman Fred Harvey Built a Railroad Hospitality Empire That Civilized the Wild West, was {{published}} in March 2010. The product of five years of cross-country research, {{the book is the}} first-ever full-length biography of restaurant and hotel mogul Fred Harvey, his innovative family business, the Harvey Girls, the Santa Fe railway, and the America they helped create. The book draws on newly discovered datebooks and letters of Fred Harvey and his son, Ford (who actually ran the company much longer than his father), which had been in family hands for decades. In support of the book, Fried embarked upon a train tour along the old Santa Fe route from Chicago to Los Angeles, visiting many of the classic mid- and southwestern cities where Harvey establishments thrived from the late 19th century well into the 20th. He was also interviewed by <b>Melissa</b> <b>Block</b> of NPR's All Things Considered, and the book won accolades from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal upon its release — the second of which complimented Fried's [...] "crisp prose and delightful detail" [...] and praised the book as [...] "sweeping social history populated with memorable characters." [...] The Wall Street Journal also named the book one of its Ten Best of the Year for 2010. It earned the same honor from The Philadelphia Inquirer, was named one of the ten best business books by Amazon.com and won the Athenaeum of Philadelphia Literary Award, a prize given to Philadelphia-area writers since 1949, for non-fiction.|$|E
40|$|There is an {{enormous}} amount of worthy coverage of the earthquake. If you have suggestions for other recommended reading, please post a comment. 1. Some of the best coverage in the United States is coming from NPR, who had <b>Melissa</b> <b>Block</b> and Robert Siegel in Sichuan to cover other stories {{at the time of the}} quake. At NPR, you can see photos, listen to and read the coverage of rural areas, and even hear <b>Melissa</b> <b>Block,</b> who was mid-interview when the earthquake struck, narrating what she saw from the street. 2. Rebecca MacKinnon posted a short piece with links to a variety of websites posting information from people in Sichuan. 3. Peter Hessler’s moving essay in The New Yorker includes notes and updates from his former students (some of whom he has written about in both his books). 4. The continuation of the torch relay’s domestic legs following the earthquake has touched off debate and anger in China. This AFP report gives more detail. 5. Melinda Liu’s oddly prescient mention of the 1976 earthquake in an article on the crisis in Myanmar raises questions about the relationship between (badly-managed) natural disasters and regime change...|$|E
40|$|<b>Melissa</b> <b>Block</b> and Terry Gross, {{students}} in Professor Ira Glass’ class on Pledge Drive Fundraising, separately took extra {{time on a}} test with a 70 minute deadline. Honor Council decided that Melissa and Professor Glass had effectively worked out education, accountability and restoration on their own, but that Terry Gross’ case {{needed to go to}} trial to achieve those goals. There were a number of conflicts and disagreements during the trial process, including who the confronting party was, how to keep the trial restorative and not punitive, an initial resolution academically separating Terry from Haverford which was later removed, and the rights of juries and faculties with respect to one another. In the end the finalized resolutions and the trial process left the jury and Terry Gross feeling as though the proper education, accountability, and restoration were back on track, though Professor Glass was left with some frustrations with the trial process...|$|E
40|$|A year ago, we were {{glued to}} our {{televisions}} and computers, {{like so many}} others in China and around the world, watching a tragedy unfold in Sichuan. The news we saw from the earthquake zone was bleak and heartbreaking. Several news sites have run memorials, one-year on, and we’ve selected a few of those in the reader below. We also point you to some of the coverage we ran atChina Beat in the days that followed. 1. One of the things Kathryn Edgerton-Tarpley stressed in a piece for China Beat last May was that Chinese volunteerism was not a brand-new phenomenon, instead linking to a strain in the late Qing. The volunteer spirit that has emerged in response to the earthquake, however, has continued to draw attention, as inthis piece at the Christian Science Monitor. 2. China has officially expressed its “gratitude” for international aid, a situation many were tracking a year ago. 3. Richard Kraus noted the historical resonances of the efforts to preserve “Grandpa” Wen’s calligraphy in Sichuan. Wen Jiabao’s written words have continued {{to be a source of}} interest, as shown by this piece about Wen sending handwritten notes to earthquake survivors. 4. The Chinese Red Cross has continued to be an important source of aid to survivors, as discussed in this piece from the Telegraph. In a two-part piece last year, Caroline Reeves wrote about the history of the Chinese Red Cross (part 1,part 2). 5. Some of you may remember that NPR reporters <b>Melissa</b> <b>Block</b> and Robert Siegel were coincidentally in Sichuan when the earthquake struck. NPR has been providing in-depth one-year coverage of the earthquake, including this piece on the sensitive topic of children who died in their classrooms. In a piece last spring, Peter Hessler relayed correspondence with his former students—about whom he wrote in River Town—immediately after the earthquake, many discussing the events at their local schools. We ran a few other pieces at CB one year ago that readers may continue to find interesting (if you didn’t read them the first time around) : Susan Brownell’s consideration of the Tangshan earthquake and the Montreal Olympics, Steve Smith’s investigation of the role rumor played in the Sichuan earthquake, and Don Sutton’s piece on the mourning rituals after the earthquake...|$|E
