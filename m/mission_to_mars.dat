40|$|To improve how we {{envision}} knowledge, we must {{improve our}} ability to see knowledge in everyday life. That is, visualization is concerned not only with displaying facts and theories, but also with finding ways to express and relate tacit understanding. Such knowledge, although {{often referred to as}} "common," is not necessarily shared and may be distributed socially in choreographies for working togetherin the manner that a chef and a maitre dhôtel, who obviously possess very different skills, coordinate their work. Furthermore, non-verbal concepts cannot in principle be inventoried. Reifying practical knowledge is not a process of converting the implicit into the explicit, but pointing to what we know, showing its manifestations in our everyday life. To this end, I illustrate the study and reification of practical knowledge by examining the activities of a scientific expedition in the Canadian Arctica group of scientists preparing for a <b>mission</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mar...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{perceived}} {{direction of}} “up” {{is determined by}} gravity, visual information, and an internal estimate of body orientation (Mittelstaedt, 1983; Dyde et al., 2006). Is the gravity level found on other worlds sufficient to maintain gravity’s contribution to this perception? Difficulties in stability reported anecdotally by astronauts on the lunar surface (NASA 1972) suggest that the moon’s gravity may not be, despite this value being far above the threshold for detecting linear acceleration. Knowing how much gravity is needed to provide a reliable orientation cue is required for training and preparing astronauts for future <b>missions</b> <b>to</b> the moon, <b>mars</b> and beyond...|$|R
5|$|For {{missions}} beyond low Earth orbit (BLEO), NASA {{has been}} directed to develop the Space Launch System (SLS), a Saturn-V class rocket, and the two to six person, beyond low Earth orbit spacecraft, Orion. In February 2010, President Barack Obama's administration proposed eliminating public funds for the Constellation program and shifting greater responsibility of servicing the ISS to private companies. During {{a speech at the}} Kennedy Space Center on April 15, 2010, Obama proposed a new heavy-lift vehicle (HLV) to replace the formerly planned Ares V. In his speech, Obama called for a manned mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025, and a manned <b>mission</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mars</b> orbit by the mid-2030s. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 was passed by Congress and signed into law on October 11, 2010. The act officially canceled the Constellation program.|$|E
5|$|The first {{sequel to}} Species, Species II was {{released}} theatrically in April 1998. The film depicts astronauts on a <b>mission</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mars</b> {{being attacked by}} the aliens from Species, and the events that ensue upon their return to Earth. There, Dr. Baker {{has been working on}} Eve, a more docile clone of Sil. Madsen and Helgenberger reprised their roles, while Henstridge played Eve. Species II was received by critics worse than the first film, garnering a 9% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, and Madsen denounced it as a terrible film. The film's director, Peter Medak, attributed the failure of the film to not picking up the infected rat ending of the original film. Navarro later authored the novelization for Species II which followed the film's original screenplay with added scenes.|$|E

Final Destination placed at No. 3 in the United States box office on its opening weekend, behind {{biography}} film Erin Brockovich and the science fiction film <b>Mission</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mars.</b> The film remained at No. 3 during the second weekend, before dropping to No. 7 on its third weekend. Final Destination continuously dropped across subsequent weekends until it fell from the top-10 list on its eighth weekend. The film lasted in theaters for 22 weekends, its last screening airing in 105 theaters and grossing $52,675, placing at No. 56. Final Destination grossed $53,331,147 in the United States and Canada on its total screening, and earned $59,549,147 in other territories, earning an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally..

40|$|The {{benefits}} of nuclear thermal propulsion are numerous and {{relevant to the}} current NASA mission goals involving but not limited <b>to</b> the crewed <b>missions</b> <b>to</b> <b>mars</b> and the moon. They do however also present new and unique challenges to the design and logistics of launching/operating spacecraft. One of these challenges, relevant to this discussion, is the significant mass of the shielding which is required to ensure an acceptable radiation environment for the spacecraft and crew. Efforts to reduce shielding mass are difficult to accomplish from material and geometric design points of the shield itself, however by increasing {{the distance between the}} nuclear engines and {{the main body of the}} spacecraft the required mass of the shielding is lessened considerably. The mass can be reduced significantly per unit length, though any additional mass added by the structure to create this distance serves to offset those savings, thus the design of a lightweight structure is ideal. The challenges of designing the truss are bounded by several limiting factors including; the loading conditions, the capabilities of the launch vehicle, and achieving the ideal truss length when factoring for the overall mass reduced. Determining the overall set of mass values for a truss of varying length is difficult since to maintain an optimally designed truss the geometry of the truss or its members must change. Thus the relation between truss mass and length for these loading scenarios is not linear, and instead has relation determined by the truss design. In order to establish a mass versus length trend for various truss designs to compare with the mass saved from the shield versus length, optimization software was used to find optimal geometric properties that still met the design requirements at established lengths. By solving for optimal designs at various lengths, mass trends could be determined. The initial design findings show a clear benefit to extending the engines as far from the main structure of the spacecraft as the launch vehicle's payload volume would allow when comparing mass savings verse the additional structure...|$|R
40|$|Paleolimnology {{provides}} information on the past chemical, physical and biological nature of water bodies. In polar regions, where global climatic changes can be exacerbated compared with lower latitudes, the science has become important for reconstructing past changes and in so doing, predicting possible effects of future changes. Owing to the association of life with water bodies, particularly stable water bodies sustained over many millennia, paleolake regions {{on the surface of}} Mars are of exobiological importance.

40|$|The human {{exploration}} of multiple space destinations (e. g Cis-lunar, NEAs), {{in view of}} the final challenge of sending astronauts to Mars, represents a current and consistent study domain especially in terms of its possible scenarios and mission architectures assessments, as proved by the numerous on- going activities on this topic, overall the Global Exploration Roadmap work. After proposing a flexible path scenario, a detailed characterization of a Design Reference <b>Missions</b> (DRM) <b>to</b> one of the intermediate destinations represents a necessity in order to evaluate the feasibility and affordability of human space exploration missions, specifically in terms of enabling technological capabilities. A human expedition to a NEA, milestone also of the GER ‘Asteroid Next' scenario, is considered the mission that would offer a large suite of benefits in terms of scientific return, operational experience and familiarity on human deep space missions, test of technologies and assessment of human factors for future long-duration expeditions (including planetary bodies), evaluation of In- Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) and, more specifically, opportunity to test asteroid collision avoidance techniques. In the proposed paper a DRM of a human expedition to a NEA is characterized in terms of strategy, missions, architectures, space system elements and technologies. Several options have been considered at the different levels of the reference mission design, and trade-offs among them have been carried out. Within the paper the different traded options, as well as the final results, for the most relevant and crucial aspects of the mission (e. g. ΔV, Mission Duration, Crew, Operations [...] .) are reported, in order to justify and support the major study choices. Once the space system elements have been identified, an overview of the critical technological areas, sub-areas and the specific enabling key technologies that, at the status of the art, require deeper studies, developments and assessments, is illustrated. The proposed DRM to a NEA would represent a milestone in human space exploration, the result of a detailed and justified process of scenario and strategies evaluation, and the starting point for the characterization of the elements subsystems and the required technologies developments. The final goal is to perform multiple destinations deep space human exploration missions in the next few decades, achieving the globally shared mission objectives and incrementally prepare the path towards the first human <b>mission</b> <b>to</b> <b>Mar...</b>|$|R

40|$|Plans for interplanetary manned space {{missions}} imply significant risks {{arising from}} human's {{exposure to the}} hostile space environment. Thus the design of reliable protection systems against the ionising cosmic radiation becomes {{one of the most}} relevant issues. In this paper the composition and magnitude of the atmospheric radiation on the planetary surface and for typical interplanetary transfer configurations have been analyzed. The investigation based on prior NASA and ESA mission results, using a manned <b>mission</b> <b>to</b> planet <b>mars</b> as a case study. According to this, the time-dependent character of the consistency of cosmic radiation has been taken into account, which is justified by the interdependence of the radiation magnitude to the solar cycle. With regard to this paper it implies even solar particle events. The results have been compared to the protective character of different materials potentially usable as a habitat's structural shell and for interplanetary spacecrafts. The investigation aimed on particle energy degradation rates and reduction of secondary particle production. In this regard the physical process of absorbing effectiveness against particle radiation has been examined by analytical calculation and given scientific results, depending on thickness and molecular composition of the materials. The most suitable materials have been used for shield design proposals using different configurations, evaluating the use of aluminium, water tanks and polyethylene bricks...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the program}} to {{investigate}} a "Gasdynamic fusion propulsion system for space exploration" {{is to develop a}} fusion propulsion system for a manned <b>mission</b> <b>to</b> the planet <b>mars.</b> A study using Deuterium and Tritium atoms are currently in progress. When these atoms under-go fusion, the resulting neutrons and alpha particles are emitted in random directions (isotropically). The probable direction of emission is equal for all directions, thus resulting in wasted energy, massive shielding and cooling requirements, and serious problems with the physics of achieving fusion. If the nuclear magnetic spin moments of the deuterium and tritium nuclei could be precisely aligned at the moment of fusion, the stream of emitted neutrons could be directed out the rear of the spacecraft for thrust and the alpha particles directed forward into an electromagnet ot produce electricity to continue operating the fusion engine. The following supporting topics are discussed: nuclear magnetic moments and spin precession in magnetic field, nuclear spin quantum mechanics, kinematics of nuclear reactions, and angular distribution of particles...|$|R
