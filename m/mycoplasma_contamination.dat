50|$|Mycoplama {{species are}} {{commonly}} found in labs as contaminants. Beginning in 1956 through the early 2000s, various organizations including Johns Hopkins, US Food and Drug Administration and the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ) in Germany, among others, have reported varying degrees of <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>contamination</b> ranging from 15%-70% of cell cultures. Mycoplasma contaminations are problematic because they are difficult to prevent and negatively impact host cell growth. Contamination is common due to their small physical size, lack of cell wall, and pleomorphism. Pleomorphism is defined as an organism's ability to modify their shape and size {{as a response to}} changes in their environment. Pleomorphism in Mycoplasma species allows bypassing of typical membrane filtration systems. As previous stated, their lack of a cell wall prevents the use of antibiotics to inhibit unwanted cell growth on cultured media. In addition to culture contamination, Mycoplasma contaminating cell cultures can {{have a negative effect on}} host cell growth by stealing nutrients from host cells. M. orale has been found to inhibit host cell growth by outcompeting the host cell for arginine. It is important to prevent contamination of Mycoplasma for reliable and accurate laboratory research results.|$|E

More specific consequences on cell metabolism are poorly known. Results Here we report the lack of significant consequence of a heavy contamination by the frequently encountered mycoplasma strain, M. hyorhinis, on the determination of respiratory chain activities, but the potential interference when assaying citrate synthase. Contamination by M. hyorhinis was detected by fluorescent imaging and further quantified by the determination of the mycoplasma-specific phosphate acetyltransferase activity. Noticeably, this latter activity was not found equally distributed in various mycoplasma types, being exceptionally high in M. hyorhinis. Conclusion While we observed a trend for respiration reduction in heavily contaminated cells, no significant and specific targeting of any respiratory chain components could be identified. This suggested a potential interference with cell metabolism rather than direct interaction with respiratory chain components. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cell {{cultures}} {{have become an}} indispensable tool in Alzheimer's disease research for studying amyloid-β (Aβ) metabolism. It is estimated that up to 35 % of cell cultures in current use are infected with various mycoplasma species. In contrast with common bacterial and fungal infections, contaminations of cell cultures with mycoplasmas represent a challenging issue in terms of detectability and prevention. Mycoplasmas are the smallest and simplest self-replicating bacteria {{and the consequences of}} an infection for the host cells are variable, ranging from no apparent effect to induction of apoptosis. Findings Here we present evidence that mycoplasmas from a cell culture contamination are able to efficiently and rapidly degrade extracellular Aβ. As a result, we observed no accumulation of Aβ in the conditioned medium of mycoplasma-positive cells stably transfected with the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP). Importantly, eradication of the mycoplasma contaminant – identified as M. hyorhinis – by treatments with a quinolone-based antibiotic, restored extracellular Aβ accumulation in the APP-transfected cells. Conclusion These data show that mycoplasmas degrade Aβ and thus may represent a significant source of variability when comparing extracellular Aβ levels in different cell lines. On the basis of these results, we recommend assessment of <b>mycoplasma</b> <b>contaminations</b> prior to extracellular Aβ level measurements in cultured cells. </p...|$|R

40|$|Mycoplasmas are a {{group of}} {{bacteria}} which lack a cell wall; {{many of them are}} pathogenic for people, animals, insects and plants. Some mycoplasma spe-cies also contaminate cell cultures used for isola-tion and propagation of viruses (Tang et al., 2000). Frequencies of such contaminations generally vary between 5 and 87 % (Rawadi and Dussurget, 1995; Garner et al., 2000). Since cell lines are used for cul-ture of animal viruses, their contaminations represent a serious problem in virology. They may produce un-reliable experimental results with consequent poten-tial risk during production of biological preparations. Natural hosts of contaminating mycoplasma species are particularly humans and various animal species. Primary sources of <b>contamination</b> with <b>Mycoplasma</b> orale, M. fermentans, and M. hominis in the labora-tories are infected people who handle cell cultures and suspensions of viruses. Sources of M. arginini, M. bovis, Acholeplasma laidlawii, and M. hyorhinis are usually animal donors of tissues and biological constituents used for cell culture, e. g. calf serum and trypsin (Razin and Tully, 1995).

40|$|Sensing of {{pathogens}} by innate {{immune cells}} {{is essential for}} the initiation of appropriate immune responses. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are highly sensitive for various structurally and evolutionary conserved molecules derived from microbes have a prominent role in this process. TLR engagement results in the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, which induces the expression of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. The exquisite sensitivity of TLR signalling can be exploited for the detection of bacteria and microbial contaminants in tissue cultures and in protein preparations. Here we describe a cellular reporter system for the detection of TLR ligands in biological samples. The well-characterized human monocytic THP- 1 cell line was chosen as host for an NF-ᴋB-inducible enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter gene. We studied the sensitivity of the resultant reporter cells for a variety of microbial components and observed a strong reactivity towards TLR 1 / 2 and TLR 2 / 6 ligands. Mycoplasma lipoproteins are potent TLR 2 / 6 agonists and we demonstrate that our reporter cells can be used as reliable and robust detection system for <b>mycoplasma</b> <b>contaminations</b> in cell cultures. In addition, a TLR 4 -sensitive subline of our reporters was engineered, and probed with recombinant proteins expressed in different host systems. Bacterially expressed but not mammalian expressed proteins induced strong reporter activity. We also tested proteins expressed in an E. coli strain engineered to lack TLR 4 agonists. Such preparations also induced reporter activation in THP- 1 cells highlighting the importance of testing recombinant protein preparations for microbial contaminations beyond endotoxins. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of monocytic reporter cells for high-throughput screening for microbial contaminations in diverse biological samples, including tissue culture supernatants and recombinant protein preparations.

40|$|Abstract Background During {{the routine}} {{laboratory}} cultivation of Lawsonia intracellularis, <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>contamination</b> {{has been a}} frequent problem. When <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>contamination</b> occurs in laboratories that study L. intracellularis, the cultures must be discarded for 4 reasons: 1) Mycoplasma is inevitably concentrated along with L. intracellularis during the passage of L. intracellularis; 2) Mycoplasma inhibits the growth of L. intracellularis; and 3) {{it is impossible to}} selectively eliminate Mycoplasma in L. intracellularis cultures. In this study, we observed the contamination of Mycoplasma species during L. intracellularis cultivation among multiple laboratories. Results The presence of a Mycoplasma infection in the L. intracellularis cultures was verified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and a sequence analysis of the partial 16 S rRNA and 23 S rRNA genes was performed. A PCR-based assay using genus-specific universal primers revealed that 29 (85. 3 %) of the 34 cultures were contaminated with Mycoplasma, including 26 with M. hyorhinis (89. 2 %), 2 with M. orale (6. 9 %), and 1 with M. fermentans (3. 4 %). The <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>contamination</b> was not the result of infection with material of pig origin. McCoy cells, which are required for the cultivation of L. intracellularis, were also ruled out as the source of the <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>contamination.</b> Conclusions In this study, M. hyorhinis was identified as the most common mollicute that contaminated L. intracellularis cultures. Whether L. intracellularis enhances the biological properties of Mycoplasma to promote infection in McCoy cells is not known. Because the McCoy cell line stocks that were used simultaneously were all negative for Mycoplasma, and the same worker handled both the McCoy cells to maintain the bacteria and the L. intracellularis cultures, {{it is possible that the}} L. intracellularis cultures are more vulnerable to <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>contamination.</b> Taken together, these results suggest that continuous cultures of L. intracellularis must be tested for <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>contamination</b> at regular intervals.

40|$|<b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>contamination</b> of cell {{cultures}} is a pervasive, often undiagnosed {{and ignored}} problem in many laboratories {{that can result}} in reduced cell proliferation and changes in gene expression. Unless contamination is specifically suspected, it is often undetected in two dimensional (2 D) cultures and the resulting effects of <b>mycoplasma</b> <b>contamination</b> are rarely appreciated {{and can lead to}} incorrect conclusions. Three dimensional (3 D) tissue cultures are increasingly utilized to explore tissue development and phenotype. However, 3 D cultures are more complex than 2 D cell cultures and require a more controlled cellular environment in order to generate structures necessary to mimic in vivo responses and are often maintained for longer time periods. Changes to the microenvironment are assumed to have a more extreme effect upon the success of 3 D tissue cultures than 2 D cell cultures, but the effects of mycoplasma have not been studied. To test this hypothesis, we grew 2 D cell cultures and 3 D tissues from pig kidney epithelial cells (LLC-PK 1) that were contaminated with mycoplasma and the same stock of cells after mycoplasma removal. We did not observe an effect of <b>mycoplasma</b> <b>contamination</b> on proliferation in 2 D monolayer cell culture. However, cyst formation in 3 D tissues was altered, with effects upon the number, size and structure of cysts formed.

40|$|Introduction: Mycoplasma species often {{contaminate}} cell {{cultures and}} other cell-derived biological substances, leading to detrimental {{effects on the}} host that include changes in growth, morphology, metabolism and protein synthesis. In cell cultures, mycoplasma are extracellular parasites, usually attached to the external surface of a cell membrane. Many researchers use a mixture of penicillin and streptomycin in the cell culture to prevent contamination. Material and methods: We prepared cell cultures of lymphocytes from peripheral blood of 12 subjects and used micronucleus, assay which is the standard method, for detection of micronuclei in binuclear lymphocytes. Results: Use of standard antibiotics does not protect cell cultures against <b>mycoplasma</b> <b>contamination.</b> Penicillin has no effect on mycoplasma since mycoplasma lack cell wall. Streptomycin inhibits about half the mycoplasma strains but is ineffective against others. In fact, mycoplasma is generally resistant to most antibiotic mixtures commonly used in cell culture. We didn’t find any <b>mycoplasma</b> <b>contamination</b> in the cell culture where penicillin-streptomycin mixture was absent, but confirmed infection in the culture containing mixture of antibiotics. Conclusion: Antibiotics and mixture of antibiotics like penicillin-streptomycin mixture does not protect the cell culture against <b>mycoplasma</b> <b>contamination.</b> Hence, contamination can spread rapidly to other cell lines through aerosol droplet dispersion...|$|E

Methods: This study was done from October 2013 to May 2014, in Human Rabies Vaccine Laboratory, Pasteur Institute Production and Research Complex, Tehran, Iran. Different dilutions of ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin were used in sequential passages for treatment of infected Vero cell line. Based on lowest passages of the cell line, antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin was done. Amelioration of the infection and removal of <b>mycoplasma</b> <b>contamination</b> was confirmed in each step by PCR method. The technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution, TOPSIS method, was used to suggest the most efficient concentration of ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin.

Cross-contamination of mouse and human cells, XMRV infection and cell function-related genes and proteins were also evaluated. Methods: PCR and DNA sequencing were used to confirm Mycoplasma hyorhinis (M. hyorhinis) contamination in human hepatocyte C 3 A cells. Five BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with 0. 5 ml paraffin oil 1 week before injection of the cells. The mice were then intraperitoneally injected with C 3 A hepatocytes (5. 0 × 106 /ml) contaminated with M. hyorhinis (6. 2 ± 2. 2 × 108 CFU/ml). Ascites were collected for monoclonal cell screening on the 14 th day after injection of contaminated cells. Elimination of mycoplasma from cells was determined by PCR and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Human–mouse cell and XMRV contamination were also detected by PCR. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR and western blotting were used to compare the expression of genes and proteins among treated cells, non-treated infected cells, and uninfected cells. Results: Fourteen days after injection with cells, 4 of the 5 mice had ascites. Hepatocyte colonies extracted from the ascites of four mice were all mycoplasma-free. There was no cell cross-contamination or XMRV infection in treated cell cultures. Elimination of Mycoplasma resulted in partial or complete recovery in the expression of ALB, TF, and CYP 3 A 4 genes as well as proteins. Proliferation of the treated cells was not significantly affected by this management. Conclusion: The method of elimination of <b>Mycoplasma</b> <b>contamination</b> in this study was validated and reproducible. Success was achieved in four of five cases examined. Compared to the previous studies, the duration of intraperitoneal passage in this study was significantly shorter...|$|E
