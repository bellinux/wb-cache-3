40|$|AbstractThe myelin {{proteolipid protein}} gene was {{characterized}} in jimpy mice {{to identify the}} specific mutation that produces dysmyelination, oligodendrocyte cell death, and death of the animal by 30 days of age. Exon 5 and flanking intron segments were isolated from jimpy proteolipid protein genomic clones and sequenced. A single nucleotide difference was noted between the normal and jimpy proteolipid protein genes: the conversion of an AG/GT to a GG/GT in the splice acceptor signal preceding exon 5, which apparently destroys the splice signal. Thus, exon 5 of the mouse myelin proteolipid protein gene is skipped during the processing of <b>mRNA,</b> <b>producing</b> a shortened proteolipid protein mRNA...|$|E
40|$|RNA editing post-transcriptionally modifies several mRNAs {{from the}} maxicircle of kinetoplastid parasites by {{addition}} and removal of uridine residues. We report here that maxicircle CR 5 transcripts of Trypanosoma brucei are edited in two domains separated by an eight nucleotide sequence that remains unedited. The large 5 ' domain is edited to a consensus sequence while the smaller 3 ' domain is edited to multiple final sequences. In all, 205 - 217 Us are inserted and 13 - 16 encoded uridines are deleted from the CR 5 <b>mRNA,</b> <b>producing</b> a mature transcript 75 - 80 % {{larger than the}} unedited transcript. The edited RNAs predict small, highly hydrophobic proteins. The carboxy terminal 15 - 30 % of these predicted proteins have multiple different amino acid sequences {{as a result of}} the variable edited 3 ' mRNA sequence, but these fall into two families of sequence. Limited amino acid sequence and hydrophobicity profile similarities suggest that the protein encoded by edited CR 5 mRNA may be a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase...|$|E
40|$|Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type I is the mildest form of {{heritable}} bone fragility {{resulting from}} mutations within the COL 1 A 1 gene. We studied fibroblasts established {{from a child}} with OI type I and demonstrated underproduction of alpha 1 (I) collagen chains and alpha 1 (I) mRNA. Indirect RNase protection suggested two species of alpha 1 (I) mRNA, {{one of which was}} not collinear with fully spliced alpha 1 (I) mRNA. The noncollinear population was confined to the nuclear compartment of the cell, and contained the entire sequence of intron 26 and a G [...] >A transition in the first position of the intron donor site. The G [...] >A transition was also identified in the genomic DNA. The retained intron contained an in-frame stop codon and introduced an out-of-frame insertion within the collagen <b>mRNA</b> <b>producing</b> stop codons downstream of the insertion. These changes probably account for the failure of the mutant RNA to appear in the cytoplasm. Unlike other splice site mutations within collagen mRNA that resulted in exon skipping and a truncated but inframe RNA transcript, this mutation did not result in production of a defective collagen pro alpha 1 (I) chain. Instead, the mild nature of the disease in this case reflects failure to process the defective mRNA and thus the absence of a protein product from the mutant allele...|$|E

40|$|Biochemical {{examination}} of the Rev-dependent expression of gag <b>mRNAs</b> <b>produced</b> from gag-Rev-responsive element (RRE) expression plasmids showed a large discrepancy between the level of cytoplasmic gag <b>mRNA</b> and the <b>produced</b> Gag protein. Significant levels of the <b>mRNA</b> <b>produced</b> {{in the absence of}} Rev were localized in the cytoplasm, while very low levels of Gag protein were produced. In the presence of Rev, the levels of mRNA increased by 4 - to 16 -fold, while the Gag protein production increased by 800 -fold. These findings indicated that in addition to promoting nucleus-to-cytoplasm transport, Rev increased the utilization of cytoplasmic viral mRNA. Poly(A) selection and in vitro translation of cytoplasmic gag mRNA verified that the <b>mRNA</b> <b>produced</b> in the absence of Rev was functional. To analyze the translational defect in the absence of Rev, we examined the association of the cytoplasmic gag mRNA with ribosomes. gag <b>mRNA</b> <b>produced</b> in the absence of Rev was excluded from polysomes, while gag <b>mRNA</b> <b>produced</b> in the presence of Rev was associated with polysomes and produced Gag protein. These observations showed that the presence of Rev was required for efficient loading of gag mRNA onto polysomes. This effect required the presence of the RRE on the mRNA. Analysis of <b>mRNAs</b> <b>produced</b> from a rev-minus proviral clone confirmed that the presence of Rev promoted polysomal loading of both gag/pol and vpu/env mRNAs. The localization of gag mRNA was also examined by in situ hybridization. This analysis showed that in the presence of Rev, most of the gag mRNA was found in the cytoplasm, while in the absence of Rev, most of the gag mRNA was found in the nucleus and in the region surrounding the nucleus. These results suggest that a substantial fraction of the gag mRNA is retained in distinct cytoplasmic compartments in the absence and presence of Rev. These findings indicate that the presence of Rev is required along the entire mRNA transport and utilization pathway for the stabilization, correct localization, and efficient translation of RRE-containing mRNAs...|$|R

UVB radiation {{is responsible for}} the majority of human skin cancers. In response to UVB-induced DNA damage, keratinocytes activate cell cycle checkpoints that arrest cell cycle progression and prevent replication of damaged DNA, allowing time for DNA repair. We report here that UVB radiation is a potent inducer of C/EBP � in human and mouse keratinocytes, as well as in mouse skin in vivo. UVB irradiation of keratinocytes resulted in the transcriptional up-regulation of C/EBP � <b>mRNA,</b> <b>producing</b> a> 70 -fold increase in C/EBP � protein levels. N-Methyl-N�-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, etoposide, and bleomycin also induced C/EBP�. UVB-induced C/EBP� was accompanied by an increase in p 53 protein and caffeine, an inhibitor of ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated kinase, and ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated and Rad 3 -related kinase inhibited UVB-induced increases in both C/EBP � and p 53. UVB irradiation of p 53 -null or mutant p 53 -containing keratinocytes failed to induce C/EBP�. UVB irradiation of C/EBP � knockdown keratinocytes displayed a greatly diminished DNA damage G 1 checkpoint, and this was associated with increased sensitivity to UVB-induced apoptosis. Our results uncover a novel role for C/EBP � as a p 53 -regulated DNA damage-inducible gene that has a critical function in the DNA damage G 1 checkpoint response in keratinocytes...|$|E
40|$|Although several plant microRNAs (miRNAs) {{have been}} shown {{to play a role in}} plant development, no {{phenotype}} has yet been associated with a reduction or loss of expression of any plant miRNA. Arabidopsis thaliana miR 164 was predicted to target five NAM/ATAF/CUC (NAC) domain–encoding mRNAs, including NAC 1, which transduces auxin signals for lateral root emergence. Here, we show that miR 164 guides the cleavage of endogenous and transgenic NAC 1 <b>mRNA,</b> <b>producing</b> 3 ′-specific fragments. Cleavage was blocked by NAC 1 mutations that disrupt base pairing with miR 164. Compared with wild-type plants, Arabidopsis mir 164 a and mir 164 b mutant plants expressed less miR 164 and more NAC 1 mRNA and produced more lateral roots. These mutant phenotypes can be complemented by expression of the appropriate MIR 164 a and MIR 164 b genomic sequences. By contrast, inducible expression of miR 164 in wild-type plants led to decreased NAC 1 mRNA levels and reduced lateral root emergence. Auxin induction of miR 164 was mirrored by an increase in the NAC 1 mRNA 3 ′ fragment, which was not observed in the auxin-insensitive mutants auxin resistant 1 (axr 1 - 12), axr 2 - 1, and transport inhibitor response 1. Moreover, the cleavage-resistant form of NAC 1 mRNA was unaffected by auxin treatment. Our results indicate that auxin induction of miR 164 provides a homeostatic mechanism to clear NAC 1 mRNA to downregulate auxin signals...|$|E

We performed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on blood samples from patients diagnosed with thyroid disease using two different RT-PCR sensitivities. Additionally, tissue specificity of TG mRNA-expression was determined using RNA extracts from 27 different human tissues. The lower limit of detection was 50 – 100 TG <b>mRNA</b> <b>producing</b> cells/ml blood using a ‘normal’ RT-PCR sensitivity and 10 – 20 cells/ml blood using a ‘high’ sensitivity. With the normal sensitivity TG mRNA was detected in 9 / 13 patients with thyroid cancer and metastasis, 63 / 137 patients {{with a history of}} thyroid cancer and no metastasis, 21 / 85 with non-malignant thyroid disease and 9 / 50 controls. With the high sensitivity TG mRNA was detected in 11 / 13 patients with thyroid cancer and metastasis, 111 / 137 patients with a history of thyroid cancer and no metastasis, 61 / 85 with non-malignant thyroid disease and 41 / 50 controls. Interestingly, using the normal RT-PCR sensitivity TG mRNA transcripts are specific for thyroid tissue and detectable in the peripheral blood of controls and patients with thyroid disease, which correlates with a diagnosis of metastasized thyroid cancer. However, with a high RT-PCR sensitivity, TG mRNA expression was found not to be specific for thyroid tissue and was not correlated with a diagnosis of thyroid cancer in patients. As a consequence, to date TG mRNA detected by RT-PCR in the peripheral blood cannot be recommended as a tumour marker superior to TG serum-level. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} {{changes in the}} amount and {{distribution}} of types I and III collagen mRNA and protein were investigated in the rat heart after induction of a left ventricular myocardial infarction (MI). Sham operated rats served as controls. The animals were sacrificed at different time intervals after operation. Northern blotting of cardiac RNA and hybridization with cDNA probes for types I and III procollagen revealed a 5 - to 15 -fold increase in the infarcted left ventricle. Type III procollagen mRNA levels were already increased at day 2 after MI, whereas type I procollagen mRNA followed this response at day 4 after MI. This increase was sustained for at least 21 days in the infarcted left ventricle for type III procollagen mRNA, whereas type 1 procollagen mRNA levels were still elevated at 90 days after MI. In the noninfarcted right ventricle a 5 - to 7 -fold increase was observed for both type I and type III procollagen mRNA levels, but only at day 4 after MI. In the non-infarcted septum a transient increase was observed for type I procollagen mRNA from day 7 - 21 (4 - to 5 -fold increase) and a decline to sham levels thereafter. In the septum type III procollagen mRNA levels were only elevated at 7 days after MI (4 - to 5 -fold increase) compared with sham operated controls. In situ hybridization with the same types I and III procollagen probes showed procollagen mRNA-producing cells in the infarcted area around necrotic cardiomyocytes, and in the interstitial cells in the non-infarcted part of the myocardium. No labeling was detected above cardiomyocytes. Combined in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed that the collagen <b>mRNA</b> <b>producing</b> cells have a myofibroblast-like phenotype in the infarcted myocardium and are fibroblasts in the noninfarcted septum and right ventricle. The increase in types I and III procollagen mRNA in both infarcted and non-infarcted myocardium was followed by an increased collagen deposition, measured by computerized morphometry on sirius red-stained tissue sections {{as well as by}} the hydroxyproline assay. In the non-infarcted septum and right ventricle the collagen-positive area was maximal at day 14 (3 - to 5 -fold increase compared with sham operated controls) and slightly declined at day 21.

40|$|Oral {{lichen planus}} (OLP) is a chronic {{inflammatory}} disease of unknown etiology. In lesions, T lymphocytes constitute the major infiltrating cell type. The present {{series of studies}} focussed on studying phenotypic, distributional and functional aspects of T cells in lesions and in blood in OLP patients, {{by virtue of the}} central role of these cells in mediating inflammatory reactions. The expression of T cell receptor V-families was assessed in biopsies. The frequency and distribution of mRNA positive cells for IFN-g, IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 10, TNF-a and TGF-b were assessed in OLP infiltrates, in situ. The number of IFN-g producing cells and the level of secretion of this cytokine was determined in blood mononuclear cells, from patients and from matched controls. Finally, the in vivo capacity of T lymphocytes to elicit delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions in skin was compared in OLP and in matched controls. Of the eleven T cell receptor V-families investigated, the Vb 3 and the Va 2 families were represented on approximately 24 % of the infiltrating cells in OLP. By contrast, in control sections from C. albicans infiltrates, the two V-families were found in only 0 - 7 % {{of the total number of}} infiltrating cells, corresponding with levels detected for each V-family in healthy blood donors. The remaining V-families were each expressed in low frequency. The restricted V-family expression in OLP lesions was interpreted as potentially being initiated by superantigens. The number of cytokine <b>mRNA</b> <b>producing</b> cells in lesions was estimated to 1 % (IFN-g) or range between 1 - 2 % (IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 10, TNF-a and TGF-b), respectively. The mRNA positive cells were distributed in association with the basement membrane, in a majority of the biopsies, suggesting that interaction with antigen-presenting cells occurs in this region. The low frequency of cytokine mRNA positive cells also suggests that the disease is maintained by few antigen-specific T lymphocytes. Similar numbers of IFN-g producing cells in blood was found in patients and controls, in response to mitogen (phytohaemagglutinin), Candida albicans antigen or when cells were left unstimulated. The levels of IFN-g that were secreted in supernatants were equivalent in patients and matched controls, for the respective antigens. Delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to the recall antigens mumps, tuberculin and streptokinase/streptodornase were reduced in oral lichen planus patients compared with matched controls. By contrast, the reponse to C. albicans was similar in patients and controls. This finding suggests that memory T cell responses to infrequently encountered antigens, represented by mumps, tuberculin and streptokinase/streptodornase may be qualitatively and/or quantitatively reduced in OLP. Memory responses to frequently recognized antigens or antigens that are part of the ubiquitous flora, such as C. albicans, may instead remain unaltered...|$|E

Magoh binds avidly and directly to Y 14 and TAP, but not to other known components of the complex, and is found in Y 14 -containing mRNPs in vivo.

D. Perkins, J. Gregonis, S. Borge, and S. A. Rice, J. Virol. 77 : 9872 - 9884, 2003). We began this study by asking whether ICP 27 homologs from other herpesviruses can also mediate this activity. Although the homologs from varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) were inactive, the homolog from bovine herpesvirus 4 (BHV- 4), termed HORF 1 / 2, was a very efficient transactivator. Surprisingly, most of the <b>mRNA</b> <b>produced</b> via HORF 1 / 2 transactivation was 225 nucleotides shorter than expected due to the removal of a previously undescribed intron from the gC transcript. We found that the gC <b>mRNA</b> <b>produced</b> {{in the absence of}} transactivation was also mostly spliced. In contrast, gC <b>mRNA</b> <b>produced</b> by ICP 27 transactivation was predominantly unspliced. Based on these results, we conclude that ICP 27 has two distinct effects on the transfected gC gene: it (i) stimulates mRNA accumulation and (ii) promotes the retention of an intron. Interestingly, the spliced transcript encodes a variant of gC that lacks its transmembrane domain and is secreted from transfected cells. As the gC splicing signals are conserved among several HSV- 1 strains, we investigated whether the variant gC is expressed during viral infection. We report here that both the spliced transcript and its encoded protein are readily detected in Vero cells infected with three different laboratory strains of wild-type HSV- 1. Moreover, the variant gC is efficiently secreted from infected cells. We have designated this alternate form of the protein as gCsec.
