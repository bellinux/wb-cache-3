40|$|Abstract: The {{evolution}} of multi-scale plasma turbulence including resistive MHD and <b>micro-instability</b> is studied {{based on a}} 5 -field gyrofluid simulation aiming to understand complex nonlinear interaction and turbulent transport. Here we report two new findings on the zonal flow (ZF) characteristics: (1) A robust oscillatory ZF with finite frequency is created in slab geometry {{for the first time}} due to the multi-scale interaction so that the ion heat transport is not efficiently suppressed. It is identified that the finite frequency ZF results from a magnetic island seesaw pivoted around the singular layer due to a net oscillatory electromagnetic torque, which is sustained by <b>micro-instability</b> through multi-scale interaction. These results imply probable relaxation of locking mode and degeneration of the favorable role of ITG ZFs in transport suppression in tokamak plasmas. (2) On the other hand, a global ZF eigenmode is found in Hasegawa-Mima(HM) model due to the radial spectral effect of ZFs, in which all components have the same enhanced growth rate. It is found that the global ZF eigenmode originates from successive cross coupling between ZFs and turbulent sidebands. ...|$|E

However, these two instabilities often occur simultaneously, with the overlap of the dynamics on {{a broad range of}} spatial scales. It is thus vital to incorporate these instabilities consistently by a proper multi-scale modeling. Furthermore, there has been an overwhelming evidence that the overall transport of heat and particles is significantly influenced by intermittency (or bursty events) caused by coherent structures. A crucial question in plasma confinement is thus the prediction of the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the transport due to these structures and of their formation.

40|$|Fermi {{acceleration}} {{can develop}} efficiently at relativistic collisionless shock waves provided the upstream (unshocked) plasma is weakly magnetized. At low magnetization, the large {{size of the}} shock precursor indeed provides enough time for electromagnetic <b>micro-instabilities</b> to grow and such <b>micro-instabilities</b> generate small scale turbulence that in turn provides the scattering required. The present paper extends our previous analysis {{on the development of}} these <b>micro-instabilities</b> to account for the finite angular dispersion of the beam of reflected and accelerated particles and to account for the expected heating of the upstream electrons in the shock precursor. We show that the oblique two stream instability may operate down to values of the shock Lorentz factor gamma_{sh}~ 10 as long as the electrons of the upstream plasma remain cold, while the filamentation instability is strongly inhibited in this limit; however, as electrons get heated to relativistic temperatures, the situation becomes opposite and the two stream instability becomes inhibited while the filamentation mode becomes efficient, even at moderate values of the shock Lorentz factor. The peak wavelength of these instabilities migrates from the inertial electron scale towards the proton inertial scale as the background electrons get progressively heated during the crossing of the shock precursor. We also discuss the role of current driven instabilities upstream of the shock. In particular, we show that the returning/accelerated particles give rise to a transverse current through their rotation in the background magnetic field. We find that the compensating current in the background plasma can lead to a Buneman instability which provides an efficient source of electron heating.

We find that a good core confinement due to strong stabilization of the micro-turbulence driven transport can be expected in the hybrid plasmas due to the stabilizing effect of the fast ion pressure that is more effective at the low magnetic shear of the hybrid discharges.

To verify how exactly the fluctuation power is transferred to small-wavelength waves by wave-wave interactions (Bernstein and cyclotron modes), a higher-order statistical analysis is needed such as bispectral or bicoherence analysis for three-wave couplings. In the present study, a Maxwellian distribution is used for the initial velocity distribution of protons, and the evolution of wave spectra is associated with not instability but nonlinear wave coupling.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the prevailing}} breach mechanisms of fluvial dikes. Piping in the dike foundation and slope failure {{as a consequence}} of seepage flow through a dike core (<b>micro-instability)</b> were identified as two of the dominant breach mechanisms for historically-grown dikes along with overtopping and slope macro-instability. For the former two mechanisms the physically-based and empirical process descriptions were reviewed and led to the formulation of the reliability functions. Evaluation of these functions in the Monte Carlo framework for the time dependent load {{led to the development of}} fragility functions. These functions indicate the probability of failure of a dike section upon loading and can be computed for each spatially discretised dike section. The probability of breaching is conditioned by the uncertainty in geometrical and geotechnical dike parameters. This uncertainty is explicitly taken into account during computation of the fragility functions in a Monte Carlo simulation. Sensitivity analysis was carried out in order to identify the sensitive geotechnical parameters influencing the distribution of failure probability. The identification of sensitive parameters indicates the priorities in geotechnical measurement campaigns aimed at the assessment of dike stability.

40|$|The {{problem of}} lateral {{instability}} of a viscoelastic in-plane loaded structure is considered {{in terms of}} thermorheolgically simple materials. As {{an example of a}} generally in-plane loaded structure, we examine the simple column under axial load: Both cyclic loading is considered (with constant or in-phase variable temperature excursions) as well as the case of constant load in the presence of thermal gradients through the thickness of the structure. The latter case involves a continuous movement of the neutral axis from the center to the colder side and then back to the center. In both cases, temperature has a very strong effect on the instability evolution, and under in-phase thermal cycling the critical loads are reduced compared to those at constant temperatures. The primary effect of thermal gradients beyond that of thermally-induced rate accelerations is occasioned by the generation of an "initial imperfection" or "structural bowing.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{multiscale}} continuum {{model is}} proposed {{to study the}} effect of grain size on the macroscopic dissipative response of shape memory alloy polycrystals during isothermal thermoelastic phase transition. In the simplest one-dimensional (1 D) heterogeneous structural hierarchy, a series of non-local and non-convex double-well continuum elements are employed to model the <b>micro-instability</b> and the macroscopic stress hysteresis of the material under uniaxial quasi-static stretching. Three characteristic length scales (specimen size L, grain size l and intrinsic material length g) of a bulk polycrystal are imbedded in the 1 D chain model and their important roles in the macroscopic dissipation are quantified. It is shown that the specific energy dissipation or {{the width of the}} stress hysteresis is governed by two non-dimensional ratios, N(=L/l) and l¯=(l/g). For a given specimen of size L, the hysteresis decreases rapidly at either very large or small values of l. In particular, it vanishes when the grain size is reduced to the nano-scale where the grain size and the interface thickness become comparable. The above results of the 1 D model are reproduced in a two-dimensional (2 D) non-local numerical experiment on the energy dissipation during multiple domain evolution in heterogeneous strips. The predictions of the two models agree well qualitatively with the recent experimental observations of the stress hysteresis in nano-grained superelastic NiTi polycrystals...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of internal transport barriers (ITBs) is investigated in MAST spherical tokamak plasmas. The {{relative importance of}} equilibrium flow shear and magnetic shear in their formation and evolution is investigated using data from high-resolution kinetic- and q-profile diagnostics. In L-mode plasmas, with co-current directed NBI heating, ITBs in the momentum and ion thermal channels form in the negative shear region just inside qmin. In the ITB region the anomalous ion thermal transport is suppressed, with ion thermal transport close to the neo-classical level, although the electron transport remains anomalous. Linear stability analysis with the gyro-kinetic code GS 2 shows that all electrostatic <b>micro-instabilities</b> are stable in the negative magnetic shear region in the core, both with and without flow shear. Outside the ITB, {{in the region of}} positive magnetic shear and relatively weak flow shear, electrostatic <b>micro-instabilities</b> become unstable over a wide range of wave numbers. Flow shear reduces the linear growth rates of low-k modes but suppression of ITG modes is incomplete, which is consistent with the observed anomalous ion transport in this region; however, flow shear has little impact on growth rates of high-k, electron-scale modes. With counter-NBI ITBs of greater radial extent form outside qmin due to the broader profile of E × B flow shear produced by the greater prompt fast-ion loss torque. © 2011 IAEA, Vienna...|$|R

40|$|Comprehensive flood risk {{assessment}} studies should quantify the global uncertainty in flood hazard estimation, for instance by mapping inundation extents {{together with their}} confidence intervals. This appears of particular importance in case of flood hazard assessments along dike-protected reaches where the possibility of occurrence of dike failures may considerably enhance the uncertainty. We present a methodology to derive probabilistic flood maps in dike-protected flood prone areas, where several sources of uncertainty are taken into account. In particular, this paper focuses on a 50 km reach of River Po (Italy) and three major sources of uncertainty in hydraulic modelling and flood mapping: uncertainties in the (i) upstream and (ii) downstream boundary conditions, and (iii) uncertainties in dike failures. Uncertainties {{in the definition of}} upstream boundary conditions (i. e. design-hydrographs) are assessed by applying different bivariate copula families to model the frequency regime of flood peaks and volumes. Uncertainties in the definition of downstream boundary conditions are characterised by associating the rating-curve used as downstream boundary condition with confidence intervals which reflect discharge measurements errors and interpolation errors. The effects of uncertainties in boundary conditions and randomness of dike failures are assessed by means of the Inundation Hazard Assessment Model (IHAM), a recently proposed hybrid probabilistic-deterministic model that considers three different failure mechanisms: overtopping, piping and <b>micro-instability</b> due to seepage.

Considering a density stratification transverse to the magnetic field, this paper aims at studying the possible occurrence of gradient-induced plasma <b>micro-instabilities</b> under typical conditions of coronal holes. Taking into account the WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation, we perform a Fourier plane waves analysis using the collisionless multi-fluid model.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} effect of a {{simulated}} tackling task on shoulder joint position sense (JPS) in rugby players. The study also aimed to assess if differences in JPS occurred between mid range and end of range JPS, and if the tackling task had angle-specific effects on these values. Design: Repeated measures. Setting: University human performance laboratory. Participants: Twenty-two asymptomatic professional rugby union players. Main outcome measures: JPS was assessed using two criterion angles in the 901 shoulder abduction position (451 and 801 external rotation) prior to and following a simulated tackling task. Results: Prior to the tackling task JPS (absolute error scores) was worse at the 451 than 801 criterion angle (po 0. 05). Following the tackling task absolute error scores were significantly increased at the 801 angle (po 0. 001), with no significant change at the 451 angle (p 40. 05), and no significant difference was present for error scores between angles (p ¼ 0. 74). Conclusions: This study found JPS to be significantly reduced following a fatiguing task. But this change was only true for the end of range position, with JPS in the mid range not changing. If the mechanoreceptors are unable to accurately report shoulder position in the outer range (stretch) position due to repetitive tackling, then there is a potential for the anterior structures to become stressed before any compensatory muscle contraction can take place.

In order to describe the evolution of these discharges, it is necessary to improve the prediction of electron thermal transport. This can be accomplished by utilizing a model for transport driven by MTMs in whole device predictive modeling codes. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop the dispersion relation that governs the MTM driven transport. A unified fluid/kinetic approach is used in the development of a nonlinear dispersion relation for MTMs. The derivation includes the effects of electrostatic and magnetic fluctuations, arbitrary electron-ion collisionality, electron temperature and density gradients, magnetic curvature, and the effects associated with the parallel propagation vector. An iterative nonlinear approach is used to calculate the distribution function employed in obtaining the nonlinear parallel current and the nonlinear dispersion relation. The third order nonlinear effects in magnetic fluctuations are included, and the influence of third order effects on a multi-wave system is considered. An envelope equation for the nonlinear microtearing modes in the collision dominant limit is introduced in order to obtain the saturation level. In the limit that the mode amplitude does not vary along the field line, slab geometry, and strong collisionality, the fluid dispersion relation for nonlinear microtearing modes is found to agree with the kinetic dispersion relation. Published by AIP Publishing. [[URL] I. INTRODUCTION Micro-instabilities can result in turbulence that influences energy confinement in tokamak discharges. One such <b>micro-instability</b> is the microtearing mode (MTM), a tearing-parity mode centered on high-order rational surfaces. Microtearing instability can provide a significant contribution to the electron thermal transport in low-aspect ratio tokamaks. 1 – 5 The MTMs lead to a tearing and subsequent reconnection of the magnetic field. MTMs are shortwavelength ion scale (low kh) electromagnetic instabilities that are driven by electron temperature gradients. 6 – 8 It was proposed that when the magnetic field has a component in the same direction as the electron temperature gradient, a current is driven in the direction of the magnetic field line, which can destabilize MTMs. These modes propagate in the electron diamagnetic drift direction and depend on the electron ion collisionality. 9, 10 Consequently, transport driven by MTM instabilities depends on both the electron ion collision frequency and the electron temperature gradient.

40|$|Magnetic {{reconnection}} is simulated {{with the}} help of covariant transport equations for the electro-magnetic field. They include an induction equation for the magnetic as well as the electric field. The transporting flow is a four-vector field (W 4). The space components of this four-vector field are of stagnation flow type and the time-component vanishes at the reconnection site. The numerical method and necessary special numerical treatment at the line along which reconnection occurs is described in detail. The way in which the timecomponent (W 0) of the transporting flow approaches zero at the reconnection line controls the type of non-ideal dynamics. Different profiles resulting in various current density distributions are studied. In reality the non-idealness necessary for reconnection may result from current-dependent <b>micro-instabilities</b> and therefore a current-dependent profile of W 0 is included. 1 Introduction Magnetic reconnection is known to be an important feature [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Interaction of an {{accretion}} disk with {{the magnetic field}} of a neutron star produces large electromotive forces, which drive large conduction currents in the disk-magnetosphere-star circuit. Here we argue that such large conduction currents will cause microscopic and macroscopic instabilities in the magnetosphere. If the minimum plasma density in the magnetosphere is relatively low is less than or aproximately 10 (exp 9) /cu cm, current-driven <b>micro-instabilities</b> may cause relativistic double layers to form, producing voltage differences in excess of 10 (exp 12) V and accelerating charged particles to very high energies. If instead the plasma density is higher (is greater than or approximately = 10 (exp 9) /cu cm, twisting of the stellar magnetic field is likely to cause magnetic field reconnection. This reconnection will be relativistic, accelerating plasma in the magnetosphere to relativistic speeds and {{a small fraction of}} particles to very high energies. Interaction of these high-energy particles with X-rays, gamma-rays, and accreting plasma may produce detectable high-energy radiation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{we show that}} in some {{parameter}} range in gyrokinetic simulations, {{it is possible to}} apply a control method to stimulate the appearance of zonal flows while minimizing the duration of the control process and the impact on plasma parameters. For this purpose, a gyrokinetic code considering only trapped particles is used. The starting point of our work is a situation where zonal flows transiently appear after the nonlinear phase of saturation of TEM (Trapped Electron Modes) or TIM (Trapped Ion Modes) <b>micro-instabilities.</b> These are observed to be strongly reduced in a later phase, permitting streamers to govern the plasma behavior in the steady-state. By intervening during this latter state (after this transient growth and decay of zonal flow), i. e. by increasing the ion/electron temperature ratio for a short time, it is found to be possible to bifurcate to a new steady-state, in which zonal flows are strongly present and are maintained indefinitely, thereby allowing a significant reduction in radial heat fluxes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper tackles the {{delicate}} {{choice of the}} initial distribution function in full-f gyrokinetic codes such as GYSELA 5 D, aiming at predicting the turbulent transport level in low collisional tokamak plasmas. It is found, both analytically and numerically, that a Maxwellian distribution function with constant profiles on magnetic flux surfaces leads to the fast generation of a large scale electric field. Such a field opposes the up–down charge separation governed by the inhomogeneity of the equilibrium magnetic field. If large enough, the shearing rate induced by the resulting poloidal E Â B velocity could efficiently reduce the plasma <b>micro-instabilities</b> which account {{for the development of}} the turbulence. Starting in the ab initio code GYSELA 5 D from an equilibrium distribution function depending on motion invariants only is shown to cure such a problem. In this case, charge separation is counterbalanced by parallel flow, and the standard fluid force balance is recovered...|$|R
