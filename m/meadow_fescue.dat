2500|$|Lolines are {{produced}} by several grass–endophyte symbioses involving epichloae species, often along with other bioactive metabolites including ergot alkaloids and indole diterpenoids, and the unusual pyrrolopyrazine alkaloid, peramine, which is not found in other biological communities or organisms. The lolines {{are produced}} at levels, however, that can exceed 10mg/g grass tissue (ranging from 2–20,000µg/g), exceeding the concentrations of the other endophyte alkaloids by >1000-fold. Lolines produced in the grasses Lolium pratense (syn. Festuca pratensis, <b>meadow</b> <b>fescue)</b> and tall fescue infected by [...] N. uncinatum and N. coenophialum (see Fig. 3), respectively, exhibit variable concentrations in grass tissues. Higher loline concentrations (100–1000µg/g) {{are present in the}} seeds and in younger leaf tissues, and the lolines display seasonal changes in concentration levels throughout the plant. The periodical appearance of tissues with high loline concentrations, such as flowering stems and seeds, contributes to this seasonal variation. Loline concentrations often increase in grass tissues regrown after defoliation and clipping of plants, suggesting an inducible defense response mechanism, involving both symbiotic partners. However, this increase appears to be due to higher loline levels in younger leaves compared to older leaves, but loline increases resembling inducible plant defenses have also been reported. Variation of loline concentration with the developmental stage of specific grass tissues suggests regulation of in planta loline distributions, providing greater protection of newly grown or embryonic tissues against attacks by insects. Surprisingly, exogenous application of the plant signaling compound, methyl jasmonate—which commonly signals predation by insects—decreases expression of the genes for the lolines. The factors that control loline production vary also among endophyte-infected grass tissues: whereas plant-supplied amino acids that are loline precursors limit accumulation of lolines in many grass tissues, their production in tissues that bear external mycelial growth for fungal reproduction (stromata) is regulated by the expression of loline genes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Mutualism {{is often}} {{conditional}} and the associations vary from antagonism to mutualism along environmental conditions and genotypes of interacting species. I studied antagonism-mutualism continuum hypothesis of symbiosis experimentally using two different Epichloë/Neotyphodium endophytes and their host grasses, agricultural <b>meadow</b> <b>fescues</b> and natural fine fescue, as study systems. These systemic fungal endophytes live asymptomatically within aerial tissues of grasses, and are vertically {{transmitted to the}} next grass generation via seeds. Thus, asexual endophyte strains are dependent on the growth, survival and reproduction of their hosts. Epichloë/Neotyphodium endophytes are considered plant mutualists, because they improve {{the resistance of the}} host against various stresses, e. g. herbivores. In addition to experimental approach, I examined prevalence and genetic structure of Epichloë festucae in natural grass populations. Finally, current knowledge concerning grass endophytes was reviewed and the effects of variable environment and genetic background on the ecology and the evolution of grass-endophyte symbiosis were discussed. The endophyte improved the performance of the agronomic <b>meadow</b> <b>fescues,</b> but the beneficial effects were dependent on the grass cultivar and the growth environment. The endophyte-infected (E+) <b>meadow</b> <b>fescues</b> were more susceptible to the pathogenic snow molds and they suffered increased winter damage compared to the endophyte-free (E-) plants. Many natural Festuca rubra and F. ovina populations were either endophyte-free or had low infection frequency. The highest infection frequencies were found in subarctic areas where the infection incidence differed between habitats. Twenty out of the 25 E. festucae genotypes detected were carrying multiple alleles in microsatellite loci indicating multiple infections or vegetative hybridization of the fungus. A dominant genotype (63. 5 % of all isolates) occurred in all populations suggesting that this fungus is mainly asexual. E+ F. ovina seedlings performed worse than endophyte-free E- seedlings. In F. rubra, the river bank originated E+ seedlings allocated fewer, but longer and heavier tillers than the other seedlings indicating possible improved performance of the endophyte infected grasses in harsh river bank conditions. In short, I detected both positive and negative effects of endophyte infection on grasses varying along species, environment and genotypic background of study subjects. The results support the antagonism-mutualism continuum hypothesis...|$|R

Other important grass susceptible hosts include smooth brome {{which can be found}} in pastures, as well as quack grass that is found in the environment and considered a weed in many agricultural crops. Lesions typically appear on both upper and lower leaf surfaces, and initially are tan to brown specks. Eventually, the tan to brown specks expand to larger irregular, oval, lens-shaped, ellipse, tan blotches with a yellow ring around them. The yellow ring {{is often referred to as}} a halo, yellow discoloration as chlorosis, and browning/death of leaf tissue as necrosis. The development of a dark brown to black spot in the center the lesion is characteristic of the disease. If warmer temperatures and moist conditions persist, spores known as conidia will move up plant as secondary inoculum and can also infect head/spikes. Symptoms on the head are indistinct, but can cause brownish glumes, and grains can have a reddish appearance similar to the pathogen Fusarium.|$|R
50|$|Discharge of {{effluent}} {{from these}} treatment plants {{and disposal of}} sludge on land is the primary route of environmental exposure to triclocarban. Research shows that triclocarban and triclosan have been detected in sewage effluents and sludge (biosolids) due to their incomplete removal during wastewater treatment.

The volume of triclocarban reentering the environment in sewage sludge after initial successful capture from wastewater is s 127,000 ± 194,000 kg/yr. This is equivalent to a 4.8 - 48.2% of its total U.S consumption volume. Crops shown to take up antimicrobials from soil include barley, <b>meadow</b> <b>fescue,</b> carrots and pinto beans.

50|$|The tall fescue-endophyte {{symbiosis}} confers {{a competitive}} advantage to the plant. Endophyte-infected tall fescue compared to endophyte-free tall fescue deters herbivory by insects and mammals, bestows drought resistance, and disease resistance. In return for shelter, seed transmission, and nutrients the endophyte produces secondary metabolites. These metabolites, namely alkaloids, are responsible for increased plant fitness. Alkaloids in endophytic tall fescue include 1-aminopyrrolizidines (lolines), ergot alkaloids (clavines, lysergic acids, and derivative alkaloids), and the pyrrolopyrazine, peramine.The lolines are the most abundant alkaloids, with concentrations 1000 {{higher than those of}} ergot alkaloids. Endophyte-free grasses do not produce lolines, and, as shown for the closely related endophyte commonly occurring in <b>meadow</b> <b>fescue,</b> Neotyphodium uncinatum, the endophyte can produce lolines in axenic laboratory culture. However, although N. coenophialum possesses all the genes for loline biosynthesis, it does not produce lolines in culture. So in the tall fescue symbiosis, only the interaction of the host and endophyte produces the lolines. Lolines have been shown to deter insect herbivory, and may cause various other responses in higher organisms. Despite their lower concentrations, ergot alkaloids appear to significantly affect animal growth. Ergots cause changes in normal homeostatic mechanisms in animals that result in toxicity manifested through reduced weight gains, elevated core temperatures, restricted blood flow, reduced milk production and reproductive problems. Peramine, like the ergot alkaloids, is found in much lower concentrations in the host compared with loline alkaloids. Its activity {{has been shown to be}} primarily insecticidal, and has not been linked to toxicity in mammals or other herbivores.|$|E
50|$|Lolines are {{produced}} by several grass-endophyte symbioses involving epichloae species, often along with other bioactive metabolites including ergot alkaloids and indole diterpenoids, and the unusual pyrrolopyrazine alkaloid, peramine, which is not found in other biological communities or organisms. The lolines {{are produced}} at levels, however, that can exceed 10 mg/g grass tissue (ranging from 2-20,000 µg/g), exceeding the concentrations of the other endophyte alkaloids by >1000-fold. Lolines produced in the grasses Lolium pratense (syn. Festuca pratensis, <b>meadow</b> <b>fescue)</b> and tall fescue infected by N. uncinatum and N. coenophialum (see Fig. 3), respectively, exhibit variable concentrations in grass tissues. Higher loline concentrations (100-1000 µg/g) {{are present in the}} seeds and in younger leaf tissues, and the lolines display seasonal changes in concentration levels throughout the plant. The periodical appearance of tissues with high loline concentrations, such as flowering stems and seeds, contributes to this seasonal variation. Loline concentrations often increase in grass tissues regrown after defoliation and clipping of plants, suggesting an inducible defense response mechanism, involving both symbiotic partners. However, this increase appears to be due to higher loline levels in younger leaves compared to older leaves, but loline increases resembling inducible plant defenses have also been reported. Variation of loline concentration with the developmental stage of specific grass tissues suggests regulation of in planta loline distributions, providing greater protection of newly grown or embryonic tissues against attacks by insects. Surprisingly, exogenous application of the plant signaling compound, methyl jasmonate—which commonly signals predation by insects—decreases expression of the genes for the lolines. The factors that control loline production vary also among endophyte-infected grass tissues: whereas plant-supplied amino acids that are loline precursors limit accumulation of lolines in many grass tissues, their production in tissues that bear external mycelial growth for fungal reproduction (stromata) is regulated by the expression of loline genes.|$|E

The studies focused on differences in seed germination, winter survival and plant growth between endophyte-infected and uninfected plants, as well as effects of nitrogen fertilization on loline alkaloid production. Knowledge about optimal seed storage conditions and uniform germination behavior can generate economic profit in seed production and for farmers. <b>Meadow</b> <b>fescue</b> seed that started to germinate early had higher frequency of viable endophytes than seed starting germination later, and heavy seed had higher germination rate and germination frequency than lighter seed.

In spring, timothy started growth earlier, had higher LAR (+ 57 %) produced more leaves (+ 83 %) with higher LERgross(+ 58 %), higher LSR (+ 61 %), higher LERnet (+ 54 %) and produced larger tillers (+ 193 % in leaf area) than <b>meadow</b> <b>fescue.</b> In autumn timothy still had a higher LAR (+ 80 %), produced more leaves (+ 60 %) with higher LERgross (+ 36 %), but had also a higher LSR (+ 77 %) and thus similar LERnet (0 %) to <b>meadow</b> <b>fescue.</b> Timothy tillers were only slightly larger than <b>meadow</b> <b>fescue</b> tillers (+ 20 % in leaf area). The consequences of these findings on competition in mixed swards and implications for grazing theories are discussed. vo...|$|E
40|$|Spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Polkka) and <b>meadow</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca pratensis Hudson cv. Kalevi) cwere {{grown in}} ambient and {{elevated}} (700 µl l - 1) carbon dioxide concentration both at present ambient temperatures and at temperatures 3 °C higher than at present simulating a future climate. The CO 2 concentrations were elevated in large (3 m in diameter) open top chambers and the temperatures in a greenhouse {{built over the}} experimental field. The photosynthetic rate of both wheat and <b>meadow</b> <b>fescue</b> was 31 37 %higher in elevated carbon dioxide (eCO 2) than in ambient CO 2 (aCO 2) throughout the growing season. The enhancement in wheat photosynthesis in eCO 2 declined 10 13 days before yellow ripeness,at which point the rate of photosynthesis in both CO 2 treatments declined. The stomatal conductance of wheat and <b>meadow</b> <b>fescue</b> was 2336 % lower in eCO 2 than in aCO 2. The amount and activity of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) in wheat were lower under conditions of eCO 2,except at elevated temperatures in 1993 {{when there was a}} clear yield increase. There was no clear change in the amount and activity of Rubisco in <b>meadow</b> <b>fescue</b> under eCO 2 at either elevated or ambient temperature. This suggests that adaptation to elevated CO 2 at biochemical level occurs only when there is insufficient sink for photosynthetic products. While the sink size of wheat can be increased only by introducing new,more productive genotypes,the sink size of <b>meadow</b> <b>fescue</b> can be regulated by fitting the cutting schedule to growth. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Meadow</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca pratensis Huds.) {{is grown}} widely in the Nordic {{countries}} in forage grass mixtures. Locally adapted cultivars are preferred for establishment of mixed swards. <b>Meadow</b> <b>fescue</b> seed yield {{is determined by}} seed weight, the number of panicle bearing tillers, size of panicles {{and the number of}} fertile florets. We aimed to determine the differences in components of seed yield in two different <b>meadow</b> <b>fescue</b> cultivars differing in forage quality; Kalevi, released in 1979, and Fure, released in 1999. Biomass accumulation was monitored, numbers of fertile and sterile florets, and seeds were counted, and the forage quality was analysed. Seed quality was also analysed. Fure was leafier and accumulated more vegetative biomass than Kalevi. Kalevi had significantly more panicles than Fure, although Fure compensated for the lower number of panicles with increased panicle size. There were no differences in number of sterile and aborted florets between cultivars. Based on the results it seems that these two <b>meadow</b> <b>fescue</b> cultivars have a completely different strategy in seed production even though the final seed yield was not markedly different. It is apparent that meadow fescues have good ability to compensate among the components of seed yield. Long-term field experiments should be conducted to investigate the interactions between plant stand ecology, seed production and cultivation technology. ...|$|E

Analysis of upper, intermediate and lower panicle branches from generative shots has showed {{their influence on}} determining of yield and quality of seed. Lower and intermediate panicle branches have showed higher importance in seed yield determining than upper branches in both species. Influence of panicle branches position on 1000 seed weight has been more variable in <b>meadow</b> <b>fescue</b> (CV(%) = 8, 41), while in tall fescue variability for germination energy and total germination have been larger (CV(%) = 11, 05 and 2, 26 respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|Post-defoliation {{carbohydrate}} stores, leaf {{area and}} the number of active meristems are important factors affecting the subsequent regrowth of grasses. Defoliation height affects the magnitude of all these factors. Timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and <b>meadow</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca pratensis Huds.) are the two most common pasture species in Finland, but little is known about their response to defoliation height. In this study the effect of three defoliation heights, 3, 6 and 9 cm, on the regrowth rates of timothy and <b>meadow</b> <b>fescue</b> in both the generative (JuneJuly) and vegetative (August) phases of growth were examined in two one-year experiment in year 2000 and 2001. In addition, the main postdefoliation parameters were measured and their contributions to regrowth were studied. In JuneJuly 2000 the regrowth rates, kg dry matter ha- 1 d- 1, of both species increased linearly by 19 % by increasing the cutting height from 3 to 9 cm. In August 2000 the regrowth rates increased by 27 % and the cumulative regrowth dry matter yield increased by 29 %. In 2001 the defoliation height had no effect on the regrowth rates but the cumulative regrowth yield increased by 10 % by increasing the cutting height. <b>Meadow</b> <b>fescue</b> produced 821 % higher cumulative regrowth yields than timothy. In the reproductive phase, the regrowth rate of timothy is dependent on the population density of vegetative tillers but for <b>meadow</b> <b>fescue</b> population density did not have such importance. In vegetative phase there was no single factor essential for regrowth rates of either of the species. ...|$|E
