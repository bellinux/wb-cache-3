25|$|Regarding the {{traditional}} pull approach to inventory control, {{a number of}} techniques have been developed {{based on the work}} of Ford W. Harris (1913), which came to be known as the economic order quantity (EOQ) model. This model marks the beginning of inventory theory, which includes the Wagner-Within procedure, the newsvendor <b>model,</b> <b>base</b> stock model and the Fixed Time Period model. These models usually involve the calculation of cycle stocks and buffer stocks, the latter usually modeled as a function of demand variability. The economic production quantity (EPQ) differs from the EOQ model only in that it assumes a constant fill rate for the part being produced, instead of the instantaneous refilling of the EOQ model.|$|E

5000|$|For minimum {{aerodynamic}} interference a sting {{should be}} {{as long as possible}} and have as small a diameter as possible, within the structural safety limits. Critical length of a sting (beyond which its influence on the flow around the model is small) is mostly dependent on Reynolds number. If the flow at the rear end of a model (<b>model</b> <b>base)</b> is laminar, the critical sting length can be as much as 12-15 base diameters. If the flow at <b>model</b> <b>base</b> is turbulent, critical sting length reduces to 3-5 <b>model</b> <b>base</b> diameters. Source [...] also suggests a sting diameter of no more than about 30% of <b>model</b> <b>base</b> diameter. However, this may not be possible in wind tunnels with high dynamic pressures because large aerodynamic loads would cause unacceptably large deflections and/or stresses in the sting.

The car was positioned as an economical luxury entry, with the LS model equipped with 8 way power seat, 15 inch alloy wheels, 4 wheel disc brakes, air conditioning, cruise control, and CD player. The LT version added traction control, ABS, and sunroof, all also optional for the LS <b>model.</b> <b>Base</b> price was $24,710 (Canadian dollars) for the LS and $27,400 (Canadian dollars) for the LT.

50|$|Model {{circuits}} were energized {{at relatively}} low voltages {{to allow for}} safe measurement with adequate precision. The <b>model</b> <b>base</b> quantities varied by manufacturer and date of design; as amplified indicating instruments became more common, lower base quantities were feasible. Model voltages and currents started off around 200 volts and 0.5 amperes in the MIT analyzer, which still allowed directly driven (but especially sensitive) instruments {{to be used to}} measure model parameters. The later machines used as little as 50 volts and 50 mA, used with amplified indicating instruments. By use of the per-unit system, model quantities could be readily transformed into the actual system quantities of voltage, current, power or impedance. A watt measured in the model might correspond to hundreds of kilowatts or megawatts in the modeled system. One hundred volts measured on the model might correspond to one per-unit, which could represent, say, 230,000 volts on a transmission line or 11,000 volts in a distribution system. Typically, results accurate to around 2% of measurement could be obtained. Model components were single-phase devices, but using the symmetrical components method, unbalanced three-phase systems could be studied as well.|$|E

The feedback connection between the hidden nodes and the context nodes belongs to the state feedback in the internal system, which has formed specific dynamic memory performance.
