Levees were constructed along the river in most urban areas, and Portland built concrete walls to protect its downtown sector. In the following decades, many large dams were built on Cascade Range tributaries of the Willamette. The Army Corps of Engineers operates 13 such dams, which affect flows from about 40percent of the basin. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> not have fish ladders.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{electrical}} impulses of AF occur {{at a high}} rate, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> not result in a heart beat. A heart beat results when an electrical impulse from the atria passes through the atrioventricular (AV) node to the ventricles and causes them to contract. During AF, {{if all of the}} impulses from the atria passed through the AV node, there would be severe ventricular tachycardia, resulting in a severe reduction of cardiac output. This dangerous situation is prevented by the AV node since its limited conduction velocity reduces the rate at which impulses reach the ventricles during AF.|$|E

He stressed the practical inability of software programmers to allow for the fact that leap seconds make time appear to go backwards, particularly when <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> not even know that leap seconds exist. The possibility of leap seconds being a hazard to navigation was presented, as well as the observed effects on commerce.|$|E
25|$|Vectors play an {{important}} role in physics: the velocity and acceleration of a moving object and the forces acting on it can all be described with vectors. Many other physical quantities can be usefully thought of as vectors. Although <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> not represent distances (except, for example, position or displacement), their magnitude and direction can still be represented by the length and direction of an arrow. The mathematical representation of a physical vector depends on the coordinate system used to describe it. Other vector-like objects that describe physical quantities and transform in a similar way under changes of the coordinate system include pseudovectors and tensors.|$|E

2500|$|Some men {{who have}} sex with other men will not relate to the term [...] "gay" [...] or homosexual, and do not regard sex with other men as sexual activity, a term they reserve for sexual {{relations}} with women. This is particularly true among individuals from non-Western cultures. Nevertheless, it is common in the US. Terms such as MSM or [...] "same gender loving" [...] are often used in place of the word gay. Men in Africa and Latin America engage in sexual relationships with other men while still referring to themselves as [...] "heterosexual", which is known as being on the [...] "down-low". The same is true of men who engage in homosexual activities in the military, gender-segregated schools and universities, or prison; <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> not consider themselves gay but still engage sexually with members of their own sex in order to fulfill their desires, exercise power, gain favors, or for other reasons.|$|E
2500|$|However, many {{adherents of}} the {{approach}} reject {{the use of the}} word secular as obfuscating and confusing, and consider that the term secular humanism has been [...] "demonized by the religious right... All too often secular humanism is reduced to a sterile outlook consisting of little more than secularism slightly broadened by academic ethics. This kind of 'hyphenated humanism' easily becomes more about the adjective than its referent". Adherents of this view, including the International Humanist and Ethical Union and the American Humanist Association, consider that the unmodified but capitalised word Humanism should be used. The endorsement by the IHEU of the capitalization of the word Humanism, and the dropping of any adjective such as secular, is quite recent. The American Humanist Association began to adopt this view in 1973, and the IHEU formally endorsed the position in 1989. In 2002 the IHEU General Assembly unanimously adopted the Amsterdam Declaration, which represents the official defining statement of World Humanism for Humanists. This declaration makes exclusive use of capitalized Humanist and Humanism, which is consistent with IHEU's general practice and recommendations for promoting a unified Humanist identity. To further promote Humanist identity, these words are also free of any adjectives, as recommended by prominent members of IHEU. Such usage is not universal among IHEU member organizations, though <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> observe these conventions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{result of}} these changes was that the lyrics on the album {{moved away from the}} overtly {{political}} lyrics of the early Scritti Politti EPs towards those that explored linguistics as a means of expressing personal politics and deconstructing the traditional love song. As Gartside explained, [...] "The problematic of language is present on the LP as an essential filter to each of the songs, dealing as <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> with love and sexuality". He described [...] "The 'Sweetest Girl'" [...] as [...] "the tendency for things to fall apart in the light of political awareness", or as he put it more directly in another interview, [...] "It's got {{a lot to do with}} the promise and the myth and the cliché of the sweetest girl", or how the male idealised vision of the perfect girl was a myth, hence the inverted commas around the song's title (a subject and a grammatical trick he would later return to on the 1986 hit single [...] "The Word 'Girl'"). The song also alludes to [...] "the sickest group in all the world", which Gartside would later admit referred to the former bandmates and collaborators he had jettisoned from the early squat-punk collective days of Scritti Politti: [...] "We were a sick group for some time. I used to read and write a lot, which was the only thing I did apart from being debauched... we were always pretty poorly".|$|E
