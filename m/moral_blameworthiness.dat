The case involved a constitutional challenge by the appellant against the Public Prosecutor for charging him with a capital offence when another accused person involved in the same drug trafficking incident was not. While the Court said that the Public Prosecutor was required to compare like with like when deciding what charge to levy on accused persons, the present case differed from the factual situation in Ong Ah Chuan. In that case, the Privy Council was examining the constitutionality of a criminal offence, and held that an offence does not violate Article 12(1) so long as provides [...] "equal punitive treatment for similar legal guilt".

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationship between procrastination, delay, <b>blameworthiness,</b> and <b>moral</b> responsibility. Undergraduate students (N = 240) were provided two scenarios in which the reason for inaction (procrastination, delay), the target (self, other), and the outcome (positive, negative) were manipulated, and students were asked to rate the <b>moral</b> responsibility and <b>blameworthiness</b> of the agent. Results indicated that individuals who procrastinated were seen as more morally responsible and blameworthy than those who otherwise experienced delay. More specifically, after a negative outcome, procrastination was associated with more moral responsibility, whereas delay was associated with less moral responsibility. After a positive outcome, individuals perceived procrastination as deserving of less moral responsibility, and delays as associated with more moral responsibility. Finally, a three-way interaction showed that participants rated procrastination that resulted in failure as deserving of responsibility when engaged in by others as opposed to oneself...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{a number}} of authors have {{suggested}} that the epistemic condition on <b>moral</b> responsibility makes <b>blameworthiness</b> much less common than we ordinarily suppose, and much harder to identify. This paper argues that such epistemically based responsibility skepticism is mistaken. Section 2 sketches a general account of moral responsibility, building on the Strawsonian idea that blame and credit relates to the agent’s quality of will. Section 3 explains how this account deals with central cases that motivate epistemic skepticism and how it avoids some objections to quality of will accounts recently raised by Gideon Rosen. But an intuitive worry brought out by these objections remains. Section 4 spells out this remaining worry and argues that, like traditional metaphysical responsibility skepticism, it has its source in a non-standard explanatory perspective on action, suggesting that strategies for explaining away the intuitive pull of traditional skepticism are applicable in this case too...|$|R

40|$|Prior to {{evolutionary}} biology, ethics, as {{a theoretical}} discipline, was essentially confined to philosophy, where it aimed to analyse {{the content of}} morality and what it required of humans. Albeit, in The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871), Charles Darwin redefined morality to be an innate biological trait, which {{is inherent in the}} human biological constitution, thereby opening the way for the ‘biologicization’ of ethics. However, the Darwinian approach projected mere elaborate descriptions of the underlying biological mechanisms of moral behaviour as ethics, thereby sidelining the core normative concerns of traditional ethics. In reducing morality to a mere biological instinct—a spontaneous outburst that requires little human striving—it logically voided the notions of <b>moral</b> culpability, <b>blameworthiness,</b> and approbation. Moreover, the biological approach consigned habit and the intellect to the primordial past, suggesting that these faculties are of secondary importance in the moral behaviour of subsequent human generations. This resulted in a ‘closed habituation’ model, which is also logically inadequate for dealing with the notions of human freedom and moral responsibility. This paper is an attempt to resolve these shortfalls, using Aristotle’s theory of moral habituation as bench mark. The paper proposed a broad theoretical model which reincorporated the sidelined concerns of traditional ethics and, therefore, demonstrated that traditional moral philosophy could not be rendered obsolete by the incursion of biology into ethics, as contemporary evolutionary theorists of ethics have claimed.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{implicit}} theories of morality, or the conceptions regarding {{the patterns of}} stability, continuity and change in moral dispositions, both in lay and academic discourses. The controversies surrounding these conceptions and the fragmentation of the models and perspectives in metaethics and moral psychology endangers the pursuit of adequate operationalizations of morally relevant constructs. The current debate between situationists, who deny that character is an useful concept for understanding human behavior, which is better explained by contextual factors (Doris 1998; Harman 1998) and dispositionists, who advocate the cross-situational stability of traits, is also present in the lay discourse, through the existence of competing commonsense ontological assumptions regarding the mutability or alterability of moral features, namely the implicit theories perspective (Chiu, Dweck, Tong, 2 ̆ 6 Fu 1997). These personal theories are primary suspects in the affective and cognitive reactions to transgressions: the type of attended information in formulating evaluative judgments, the calibration of <b>moral</b> responsibility and <b>blameworthiness,</b> the assignment of retribution or reparatory recommendations to transgressors.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops a}} Kantian quality of will account of <b>moral</b> <b>blameworthiness.</b> Part I {{starts with a}} discussion of the Reinhold/Sidgwick Objection. According to this objection, anyone who accepts the Kantian conception of autonomy is forced to draw the absurd conclusion that no one is ever morally blameworthy for anything. I show that this objection depends on the implicit premise that freedom is a necessary condition for <b>moral</b> <b>blameworthiness.</b> While rejecting the standard Kantian replies to the objection, I proceed to investigate which sort of freedom is necessary for blameworthiness. Part II focuses on the problem of free will. On what I call the Traditional View, agents are morally blameworthy for an action only if that action is transcendentally free. After showing that Kantian attempts to reconcile this sort of freedom with causal determinism rely on implausible and ad hoc metaphysical assumptions, I investigate which principles might support the Traditional View. The natural candidates are the Principle of Alternate Possibilities (PAP) and the principle Ought Implies Can (OIC). While demonstrating that Kant rejects PAP, I argue that Kant’s version of OIC does not support the Traditional View. The view can thus be rejected. Part III then develops a Kantian quality of will account of excuses and exemptions. This account explains why physical constraint, unintentional bodily movement, ignorance and coercion often provide an excuse and why schizophrenic patients suffering from psychotic episodes are often exempted from moral responsibility. If the proposed account is correct, the Reinhold/Sidgwick Objection does not take hold...|$|E
40|$|Scientifically valid {{instruments}} {{are being used}} {{for the first time}} to assess an individual’s risk of violence in criminal sentencing and in the civil commitment of mental patients and sexual predators. Risk factors on these instruments pertain to what the person is (e. g., gender), what the person has (e. g., personality disorder), what the person has done (e. g., past violence), and what has been done to the person (e. g., past victimization). In this Article, I argue that in criminal law, with its emphasis on blameworthiness for actions taken, the admissibility of scientifically valid risk factors is properly constrained to those that simultaneously index <b>moral</b> <b>blameworthiness,</b> i. e., to the defendant’s prior criminal conduct. In contrast, the civil commitment of people with mental disorder—a determination in which <b>moral</b> <b>blameworthiness</b> plays no part—should not constrain the admissibility of violence risk factors, except for those subject to strict Equal Protection scrutiny. Finally, in the commitment of sexually violent predators, courts should keep evidentiary issues about the admissibility of violence risk factors apart from substantive questions about the constitutionality of the statutes that trigger risk assessment. If commitment as a sexually violent predator is properly categorized as civil commitment, the admissibility of violence risk factors in implementing such commitments should parallel the admissibility of violence risk factors in the civil commitment of mental patients. Disagreement with the substantive merits of sexually violent predator statutes does not justify depriving decision makers of the only kind of scientific evidence—empirically-validated actuarial violence risk assessment—that can effectuate their statutory goals...|$|E

The responsible corporate officer doctrine is flawed because under the doctrine it is irrelevant that the executive did not intend for the misconduct to occur. It is not a defense that the executive delegated responsibility in good faith. Nor is it a defense that the executive is not knowledgeable about or {{did not participate in}} the misconduct. The only potential defense is impossibility, but it has never been used successfully. Even if those shortcomings in the responsible corporate officer doctrine were overlooked {{due to the fact that}} it is a misdemeanor charge, the piling on of long periods of exclusion significantly raises the stakes for the executives. Part II of this Article sets forth the foundation for and justification of the responsible corporate officer doctrine. It also scrutinizes the shortcomings of the responsible corporate officer doctrine. Part III of this Article examines the collateral consequences of conviction as a responsible corporate officer. It uses the exclusion of Purdue Pharma executives as a case study to examine the justification for and problems with excluding executives who had no knowledge of wrongdoing. It {{argues that the}} collateral consequence of conviction - exclusion - is more devastating than the criminal sentence that an executive would face upon conviction. Part IV argues that a conviction as a responsible corporate officer does not demonstrate that the executive is morally blameworthy for the actions of subordinates.

40|$|The {{criminal}} law declines to punish merely for bad attitudes {{that are not}} properly manifested in action. One might try to explain this on practical grounds, but these attempts do not justify the law’s commitment to never punishing unmanifested mental states in worlds relevantly similar to ours. Instead, a principled explanation is needed. A more promising explanation thus is that one cannot be criminally culpable merely for unmanifested bad attitudes. However, the leading theory of criminal culpability has trouble making good on this claim. This is the theory that an action is criminally culpable {{to the extent that}} it manifests insufficient regard for legally protected interests. The trouble is that this theory’s defenders have not adequately explained what it is for an action to manifest insufficient regard. In this paper, I aim to provide the required account of manifestation, thereby rendering the insufficient regard theory more defensible. This, in turn, allows the view to explain the broad range of doctrines that treat unmanifested mental states as irrelevant. The resulting theory of criminal culpability is both descriptively plausible and normatively attractive. Moreover, it highlights the continuity between criminal culpability and <b>moral</b> <b>blameworthiness</b> by showing how the former functions as a stripped-down analogue of the latter...|$|E
40|$|It {{is easy to}} {{understand}} the apparent appeal of strict liability to policymakers and legal reformers seeking to reduce crime: if the criminal law can do away with its traditional culpability requirement, it can increase the likelihood of conviction and punishment of those who engage in prohibited conduct or bring about prohibited harm or evil. And such an increase in punishment rate can enhance the crime-control effectiveness of a system built upon general deterrence or incapacitation of the dangerous. Similar arguments support the use of criminal liability for regulatory offenses. Greater punishment rates suggest greater compliance. But this analysis fails to appreciate the crime-control costs of strict liability. By explicitly providing for punishment in the absence of <b>moral</b> <b>blameworthiness,</b> the law undermines its moral credibility with the community and thereby provokes subversion and resistance instead of the cooperation and acquiescence it needs for effective crime control. More importantly, the system 2 ̆ 7 s lost moral credibility undermines the law’s ability to harness the powerful forces of stigmatization, social influence, and internalized norms.

40|$|Criminal {{and civil}} law differ greatly {{in their use}} of the element of intent. The {{purposes}} of intent in each legal system are tailored to effectuate very different goals. The Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent decision in Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S. A., 131 S. Ct. 2060 (2011), however, imported a criminal concept of intent [...] willful blindness [...] into the statute for patent infringement, a civil offense. This importation of a criminal law concept of intent into the patent statute is novel and calls for examination. This Article compares the purposes behind intent in criminal law with the purposes behind intent in patent law to demonstrate that this importation does not achieve the policy goals of the patent regime. Criminal law jurisprudence requires an intent element for three reasons: to ascribe a level of <b>moral</b> <b>blameworthiness</b> to an act, to separate criminal from civil liability, and to shield otherwise innocently acting defendants from criminal punishment. Patent infringement actions, by contrast, lack an intent element because they almost exclusively seek to remedy economic harms. The importation of criminal concepts of knowledge into the patent infringement statute may therefore lead to unwanted consequences, particularly, higher-than-warranted burdens of proof for patent holders. To this end, equating criminal mental states to civil ones risks treating patent infringement as criminal conduct. This Article concludes by proposing that courts should examine the purposes of mental state requirements on a statute-by-statute basis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the major constitutional {{decisions of the}} Supreme Court of Canada in the 2008 calendar year. The Court handed down a total of 74 judgments in 2008, just 12 (or 16 per cent) of which were constitutional cases. Ten of these were Charter cases, while the other two dealt with federalism issues. A full 7 of the 10 Charter claims succeeded, while one federalism claim was successful. In the most significant section 15 judgment since the Law decision almost a decade earlier, R. v. Kapp brought some much-needed clarification and simplification to equality law. Meanwhile, the Court also released two judgments {{on the law of}} search and seizure with respect to sniffer dogs, R. v. Kang-Brown and R. v. M. (A.). Three constitutional decisions engaged the issue of Canada’s role internationally; most significantly, Canada (Justice) v.

40|$|The {{practical}} {{disappearance of}} the jury trial ranks among the most widely examined topics in American criminal justice. But, by focusing on trial scarcity, scholars have managed to tell {{only part of the}} story. The unexplored first-order question is whether juries even do their work well. And {{the answer to that question}} turns on the kinds of work jury members are typically required to do. Once upon a time, trials turned upon practical reasoning and general <b>moral</b> <b>blameworthiness.</b> Modern trials have come to focus upon legal reasoning and technical guilt accuracy. In turn, the jury has evolved from a flexible body to a rule-bound institution. But, of course, even as trials have changed, laypeople’s capacities have stayed largely the same. Laypeople remain more skilled at the art of equitable evaluation than the science of legal analysis. It does not follow, however, that the criminal justice system should revert to equitable trial practices. The modern trial is professional and legalistic for good reason. The rule of law commands that criminal convictions be products of precisely drawn criminal codes and formal processes. Nevertheless, there are other procedural stages—arrest, charge, bail, bargain, and sentence—where equitable discretion is more appropriate. These are the stages at which criminal justice should concentrate lay efforts. In this Symposium Essay, I describe the historical and constitutional trends that have entrenched popular participation in all the wrong places. And I propose redirecting jury practice from criminal trials to other adjudicatory sites. Finally, I make the case that my reforms are consistent with (and perhaps even integral to) the legality principle, properly considered...|$|E
40|$|In this {{perspective}} piece, the author attacks {{the notion of}} 2 ̆ 2 moral involuntariness 2 ̆ 2 in the Supreme Court of Canada 2 ̆ 7 s judgment in R. v. Ruzic. He asserts that the voluntarist account of criminal liability is purely descriptive. Through the embrace of a mechanistic understanding of human agency, it forestalls judgment and veils the normative foundation of criminal law. The author asserts {{the need for a}} more normative approach, one which seeks to evaluate the <b>moral</b> <b>blameworthiness</b> of an act. In the case of duress, the author suggests that {{it is not enough to}} simply state that a person 2 ̆ 7 s will is constrained because he or she is acting under the influence of emotion. An evaluative account of emotions would suggest that emotions involve thought on the part of the actor, and that emotions can be mistaken. Therefore, the moral bases of emotions can and should be evaluated. The law could have considerable conservative inertia under a legal regime which allowed certain attitudes to go unexamined. For instance, the sources of a particular 2 ̆ 2 emotional 2 ̆ 2 reaction might be rooted in a subordinating, retrograde vision of society that placed a low value on certain classes of persons. Hence, the voluntarist account may allow morally suspect social norms and their regressive effects to persist in the criminal law. Through these and other lines of inquiry, the author leads us to question some of the underpinnings of criminal law thinking, and calls for the reintroduction of meaningful and open judgment into the law of criminal defences...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} dual-process risk {{perception}} model that integrates cognitive and emotional {{as well as}} consequentialist and deontological components by distinguishing between two modes of evaluative processing: (a) a consequentialist evaluation that focuses on potential consequences and (b) a deontological evaluation that focuses on moral values. Each of these two modes is assumed to trigger specific cognitive evaluations, specific emotions, and specific behavioral tendencies concerning a perceived risk. We conducted an experiment (N = 270) that tested whether the relative dominance of the two evaluative modes {{would depend on the}} causal structure of the environmental risk being evaluated and on the social role of the evaluator. Three types of causal structure were varied by providing scenario information: (a) anthropogenic risks that endanger only nature, (b) naturally caused risks with potential harmful consequences for humans, and (c) anthropogenic risks that may harm humans. Participants evaluated each scenario from the perspective of one of three social roles: mayor, expecting parent, and environmental activist. For each scenario, participants specified their focus and evaluated the event’s morality and perceived risk, the intensity of specific emotions, and their preferences for prospective behaviors. Results showed that the consequentialist evaluation was generally stronger than the deontological evaluation and was less affected by the experimental manipulations. The deontological evaluation was substantially affected by the risk’s causal structure. It was stronger for anthropogenic than for natural causation; risks caused by humans were associated with greater perceived <b>moral</b> <b>blameworthiness,</b> more intense morality-based emotions (e. g. outrage), and a stronger tendency to perform agent-related behaviors (e. g. aggression) than naturally occurring risks. The effect of the social role was less pronounced than that of the causal structure. Furthermore, the effect of an evaluative focus on behavior was fully mediated by emotions for deontological evaluations and partially mediated for consequentialist evaluations. The implications for environmental risk perception and communication are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} I provide and defend a {{solution}} to the problem of moral luck. The problem of moral luck is that there is a set of three theses about luck and <b>moral</b> <b>blameworthiness</b> each of which is at least prima facie plausible, but that, it seems, cannot all be true. The theses are that (1) one cannot be blamed for what happens beyond one’s control, (2) that which is due to luck is beyond one’s control, and (3) we rightly blame each other for events that are due to luck. I suggest that the response which distinguishes between degree and scope of blameworthiness is promising. The main objection that one might level against this approach is that it seems to lead to the absurd conclusion that we, in the actual world, are as blameworthy as the person we could have been and who performs all sorts of heinous acts in a far away possible world. For, we in the actual world and our counterpart in a far away possible world are both such that we would perform certain heinous acts in particular circumstances. I argue that this objection can be met, namely by paying attention to the nature of luck. By using the insights into the nature of luck that have been gained by epistemologists, we can solve the problem of luck as it has been formulated by ethicists. For, epistemologists have argued that some event is due to luck only if it fails to occur in a substantial number of nearby possible worlds. I defend this account of luck and argue that the problem of moral luck can be solved if we pay attention to the nature of luck. I, therefore, call my solution to the problem of moral luck a modal solution...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{explores the}} rise of 2 ̆ 2 {{machines}} 2 ̆ 2 in criminal adjudication. Human witnesses now often give way to gadgets and interpretive software, juries 2 ̆ 7 complex judgments about <b>moral</b> <b>blameworthiness</b> give way to mechanical proxies for criminality, and judges 2 ̆ 7 complex judgments give way to sentencing guidelines and actuarial instruments. Although mechanization holds much promise for enhancing objectivity and accuracy in criminal justice, that promise remains unrealized because of the uneven, unsystematic manner in which mechanized justice has been developed and deployed. The current landscape of mechanized proof, liability, and punishment suffers from predictable but underscrutinized automation pathologies: hidden subjectivities and errors in 2 ̆ 2 black box 2 ̆ 2 processes; distorted decision making through oversimplified-and often dramatically inaccurate-proxies for blameworthiness; the compromise of values protected by human safety valves, such as dignity, equity, and mercy; and even too little mechanization where machines might be a powerful debiasing tool but where little political incentive exists for their development or deployment. For example, the state promotes the objectivity of interpretive DNA software that typically renders match statistics more inculpatory, but lionizes the subjective human judgment of its fingerprint and toolmark analysts, whose grandiose claims of identity might be diluted by such software. Likewise, the state attacks the polygraph as an unreliable lie detector at trial, where results are typically offered only by defendants, but routinely wields them in probation revocation hearings, capitalizing in that context on their cultural status as 2 ̆ 2 truth machines. 2 ̆ 2 The Article ultimately proposes a systems approach 2 ̆ 2 trial by cyborg 2 ̆ 2 -that safeguards against automation pathologies while interrogating conspicuous absences in mechanization through 2 ̆ 2 equitable surveillance 2 ̆ 2 and other means...|$|E
40|$|Canadian law {{has long}} {{recognized}} that because youth have limited capacities and greater vulnerability, {{they should be}} afforded a special status {{in the criminal justice}} system. Since the Youth Criminal Justice Act (“YCJA”) came into force in 2003, the Supreme Court has favoured a “pro-youth” interpretation of the Act, restricting the use of custody for young offenders and protecting their legal rights. The 2008 decision of the Supreme Court in R. v. B. (D.) significantly extended this protective approach, recognizing that the principle of the “diminished moral blameworthiness” of youth {{in the criminal justice system}} has not only a statutory basis, but also a constitutional foundation. Writing for a five-member majority of the Court, Abella J. ruled that provisions of the YCJA that impose an obligation on a youth found guilty of a very serious offence to justify not imposing an adult sentence are unconstitutional. The majority also took a more expansive view of section 7 of the Charter, finding that the social and psychological stresses associated with identifying publicity are engaged if a youth is named in media reports, and ruled unconstitutional a provision of the YCJA requiring a youth found guilty of one of the most serious offences and receiving a youth sentence to justify a ban on the publication of identifying information. Significantly, the Court was unanimous in accepting that the diminished <b>moral</b> <b>blameworthiness</b> of youth is a principle of fundamental justice, though it was sharply divided in the application of this newly recognized principle. R. v. B. (D.) is the most important judgment of the Court regarding youth offending in the history of Canada, and will both affect judicial approaches to youth justice issues and constrain possible legislative reforms that might make the youth system more “adult-like”. The decision also suggests that a narrow majority of the Court is prepared to take a relatively broad approach to section 7 of the Charter...|$|E
40|$|Emeseh, Engobo, 'Corporate Responsibility for Crime: Thinking {{outside the}} Box' I University of Botswana Law Journal (2005) 28 - 49 RAE 2008 Since the 19 th century when {{corporations}} were first made {{the subject of}} criminal law, {{there has been a}} ongoing controversy regarding the theoretical basis of this. The crux of this debate is whether criminal liability can exist without <b>moral</b> <b>blameworthiness,</b> or put another way, whether corporations not being human or natural person can be held responsible for a crime which ostensibly connotes fault or moral wrongdoing. In spite of this however, there is increasing use of criminal sanctions to regulate corporate behavior. Public opinion is also increasing in favor of criminalizing corporate wrongs. This has been more so {{in the latter part of}} the 20 th century, when the power and influence wielded by corporations and the harm they can cause has been highlighted in several high profile incidents involving corporations. It is therefore unlikely that corporate criminal liability will go away in the near future if at all. Against this background, this paper, after reviewing the current debate and developments in corporate criminal liability theory, argues that although there are apparent theoretical problems in the current methods of attribution of criminal liability to corporations, this is more to do it limiting such thinking within the confines of existing criminal law theory, Criminal law theories applicable to natural persons obviously have constraints when applied to a non natural person. Nevertheless, law, just as the society it servers, is dynamic and therefore criminal law theories have to adapt to the realities of the modern world. Corporate criminal liability is here to stay for the foreseeable future and therefore what is needed is perhaps a pragmatic approach which seeks to make its application more effective. In this regard, there are already attempts to develop alternative models for attributing liability to corporations. These are far from perfect theories at this stage. Nevertheless, they are pragmatic in their approach and a worthwhile focus of academic attention. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|It is {{a commonplace}} {{to hold that}} faultless {{mistakes}} of fact justify [...] or, at least, excuse [...] an agent's actions. Less prominent, however, is the view that faultless mistakes about morality similarly come to bear on our attributions of <b>moral</b> <b>blameworthiness.</b> My aim in this dissertation is to defend what I call the symmetry thesis: faultless mistakes of morality excuse just as do faultless mistakes of fact. Opposition to this thesis, I think, falls out of an incorrect understanding {{of the way in}} which faultless mistakes of fact come to bear on our attributions of moral responsibility. Accordingly, much of the dissertation is composed of an analysis of the excusing force of faultless mistakes of fact. Chapter 1 argues that faultless mistakes of fact are appropriately deemed excused, not justified, by morality and the law. Chapter 2 develops a challenge to what I call the traditional analysis of the excusing force of mistakes. This view holds that an agent's faultless mistake is excusing if, and only if, the mistake undermines, displaces, or, as they say in the criminal law, "negatives" the agent's subjective culpability. I suggest that concerns about voluntariness, not subjective culpability, are in order. Chapter 3 develops an account of voluntariness. I argue that an agent's actions are voluntary enough for an attribution of responsibility only if he did what he is accused of doing because this is something he was willing to do (in the fashion in which it was done) [...] only if, that is, what he did conforms to his will. Chapter 4 then applies this account of the excusing force of faultless mistakes of fact to cases of faultless mistakes of morality. I conclude that an agent is morally blameworthy for his actions only if he believes that what he is doing is wrong, it is true that what he is doing is wrong, and his reasons for so believing properly identify the features of his actions that make them wrong...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The “bloedige hand” {{principle}} {{stipulates that}} no person who causes {{the death of}} another person, intentionally or negligently, may inherit from the deceased. The legal position of the beneficiary who intentionally killed the testator is certain - he or she cannot inherit from the former. However, it is fairly uncertain how the “bloedige hand” principle is applied {{in cases where the}} testator’s death was negligently caused by his or her beneficiary. In some cases of negligence, for example a motorcar accident, the community does not view the action of the perpetrator as blameworthy. <b>Moral</b> <b>blameworthiness</b> is used as an indication of whether the “bloedige hand” principle should be applied or not. No law case exists where courts applied the “bloedige hand” principle in situations where the death of a testator was negligently caused by the driving of a motorcar. There are a number of writers who are of the opinion that the principle should be relaxed to put motorcar accidents out of the ambit of the “bloedige hand” principle. The uncertainty surrounding the application of the “bloedige hand” principle in the case of negligence has a potential effect on estate planning, because the benefits one would have received as beneficiary would be lost if the testator was negligently killed by such beneficiary. The testator should therefore make provision in his or her will for cases where he or she is negligently killed by one or more of his or her beneficiaries. The aim of this dissertation is to discuss the principles relevant to the “bloedige hand” principle in the case of negligence and to identify the potential impact of the principle on estate planning, and then to advance mechanisms which can be used by the testator to keep estate planning in place {{if he or she is}} negligently killed by one or more of his or her beneficiaries.
