5000|$|In {{his book}} Perspectives on initiation, Guénon clarifies the signification {{given by the}} ancient Greeks to the {{classical}} names of lesser and greater mysteries: [...] "they are not different [...] "types" [...] of initiations, but stages or degrees of a same initiation".Lesser mysteries lead to the [...] "perfection of the human state", in other words to [...] "something traditionally designated by {{the restoration of the}} [...] "primordial state", a state that Dante, in the Divine comedy, relates symbolically to the [...] "terrestrial paradise". On another hand, [...] "greater mysteries" [...] refer properly to [...] "the realization of supra-human states"; they correspond to the Hindu doctrine of [...] "delivrance" [...] (Moksha) and to what Islamic esoterism calls the [...] "realization of the Universal Man": in that latter tradition, [...] "lesser" [...] and [...] "greater" [...] mysteries correspond exactly to the signification of the terms [...] "el-insân el-qadîm" [...] and [...] "el-insan el-kâmil". These two phases are related to an interpretation of the symbolism of the cross with the notions of [...] "horizontal" [...] and [...] "vertical" [...] realization. They also correspond respectively to what is traditionally designated in western hermeticism by the terms royal initiation and sacerdotal initiation:Pure metaphysical knowledge relates consequently to [...] "greater mysteries", and the knowledge of traditional sciences to the [...] "lesser mysteries". From an historical perspective, the [...] "lesser mysteries" [...] being merely a preparation to the [...] "greater mysteries" ... ultimately one has to go back beyond the very origin of humanity, and this is why a question such as an [...] "historical" [...] origin of initiation appears to be devoid of the least signification.The traditional sciences whose knowledge provides restoration of [...] "primordial state" [...] are known under the name of cosmological sciences: among them, one can quote alchemy, astrology, the science of letters, and more generally what is referred under the name Hermeticism. In the West, the Brothers of the Ross-Cross were beings that had effectively achieved the completion of lesser mysteries, and Rosicrucian initiation inspired by them was a particular form linked to Christian Hermeticism. René Guénon writes moreover that this Rosicrucian initiation is lost today and is completely unrelated to the various modern organizations bearing that name Rosicrucian, as they belong to modern fallacies falling under the general denomination of pseudo-initiation given by Guénon to them - <b>more</b> <b>on</b> this <b>later.</b> <b>That</b> word 'Hermeticism' indicates a tradition of Egyptian origin, afterward clothed in a Hellenized form, and in the Middle Ages transmitted in this form both to the Islamic and Christian worlds, and, to the second in great part by the intermediary to the first (something which relates to the relationship that Rosicrucianism had at its origin with Islamic esoterism), as is proven, writes René Guénon, by the numerous Arabic or Arabized terms adopted by the European Hermeticists, beginning with the word 'alchemy' itself (al-kimya). 'Hermeticism' designates a doctrine related to Hermes [...] "insofar as the latter was considered by the Greeks to be identical with the Egyptian Toth". Hermeticism cannot be regarded as constituting a traditional doctrine complete in itself, [...] "for here we are dealing with knowledge that is not of a metaphysical order, but is only cosmological". Hence, Hermeticism was later incorporated into Islamic esoterism where it was rooted into a purely metaphysical doctrine, as it is shown for instance with Mohyddin Ibn Arabi who is both designated as the Seal of Saints and The Master of Red Sulfur, that latter designation referring to a very high degree of the initiatic hierarchy.|$|R

Heisenberg noticed, however that if he tried to use the same schema to multiply two variables, such as momentum, p, and displacement, q, then [...] "a significant difficulty arises." [...] It turns out that multiplying a matrix of p by a matrix of q gives a different result from multiplying a matrix of q by a matrix of p.

40|$|There is no adequate, broadly based, yet {{thorough}} textbook in planetary science. One suspects {{several reasons}} for this: the field is changing rapidly and texts are threatened by obsolescence, the field is so broad and interdisciplinary that no person or {{small group of people}} could hope to do it justice, the appropriate authors are too busy doing science or NASA committee work, or maybe it is simply a thankless task (certainly not a lucrative one, given the small scientific community involved). In these circumstances, John Lewis and Ron Prinn should be highly commended for their scholarly attempt to summarize part of the spectrum of disciplines involved in planetary science. Their new text may be a very personal (some would say idiosyncratic) view of planetary atmospheres, and has an overwhelmingly chemical perspective, but it is without peer.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a puzzle about justification and withholding. The puzzle arises {{in a special}} case where experts advise us to not withhold judgment. My main thesis is simply that the puzzle is genuinely a puzzle, and so leads us to rethink some common assumptions in epistemology, specifically assumptions {{about the nature of}} justification and doxastic attitudes. Section 1 introduces the common assumptions. Section 2 presents the puzzle case. Section 3 assesses the puzzle case. Section 4 explains the choice we’re faced with. Sections 5 and 6 consider and reject some proposed solutions, and in the process refine and clarify the choice we’re faced with. Section 7 considers and rejects a miscellany of different proposed solutions. 1. Common assumptions The puzzle I will present arises in acute form if we accept three common views in epistemology. (In the end, it seems to arise if we accept only two of these, and arguably arises if we accept only one of them; <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>later,</b> in sections 5 and 6.)

40|$|My {{wife and}} I visited Brazil in December and January this past year, {{spending}} the Christmas and New Year’s holidays there. Since {{my wife is}} Brazilian, I have taken an interest in exploring Brazilian culture and history. This interest, {{and the fact that}} we were in Brazil for a month, prompted me to take a couple of days to visit various libraries and see how things are done there. I visited three basic types of libraries in the capital district of Brasilia. The Universidade de Brasilia, Biblioteca Central (the University of Brasilia Central Library), two different types of public libraries, and the government libraries of the Senado Federal (Senate) and the Camara dos Deputados (House of Deputies). I could not visit the National Library of Brazil, because it remained in Rio de Janeiro when the new capital was built in the 1960 s. There has been some discussion of moving it to Brasilia, but to this day, that has not happened. I would still like to visit there anyway, but Rio was covered on our previous trip, and I don’t know when I will get there again. My main objective was to visit each of these places, talk with the librarians, and discover what things are the same and what things are different from what we do here in the States. What I discovered is that, although there are many differences, there are also many things that seem very familiar or are just virtually the same as here. While talking with the librarians, through my wife who graciously translated, I asked several questions both out of general interest and in the areas I am most familiar. Of the three types of libraries, those in the government and academic libraries were the most willing to talk with me; whereas, those in the public libraries seemed more interested in getting rid of me. <b>More</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>later...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. First, a brief {{historical}} {{trace of}} the developments in confirmation theory leading up to Goodman’s infamous “grue ” paradox is presented. Then, Goodman’s argument is analyzed from both Hempelian and Bayesian perspectives. A guiding analogy is drawn between certain arguments against classical deductive logic, and Goodman’s “grue ” argument against classical inductive logic. The upshot of this analogy is that the “New Riddle ” is not as vexing as many commentators have claimed (especially, from a Bayesian inductive-logical point of view). Specifically, the analogy reveals an intimate connection between Goodman’s problem, and the “problem of old evidence”. Several other novel aspects of Goodman’s argument are also discussed (mainly, from a Bayesian perspective). 1. Prehistory: Nicod & Hempel In order to fully understand Goodman’s “New Riddle, ” {{it is useful to}} place it in its proper historical context. As we will see shortly, one of Goodman’s central aims (with his “New Riddle”) was to uncover an interesting problem that plagues Hempel’s [17] theory of confirmation. And, Hempel’s theory was inspired by some of Nicod’s [25] earlier, inchoate remarks about instantial confirmation, such as: Consider the formula or the law: A entails B. How can a particular proposition, [i. e. ] a fact, affect its probability? If this fact consists of the presence of B in a case of A, it is favourable to the law [...] . on the contrary, if it consists of the absence of B in a case of A, it is unfavourable to this law. By “is (un) favorable to, ” Nicod meant “raises (lowers) the inductive probability of”. In other words, Nicod is describing a probabilistic relevance conception of confirmation, according to which it is postulated (roughly) that positive instances are probability-raisers of universal generalizations. Here, Nicod has in mind Keynesian [21] inductive probability (<b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>later).</b> While Nicod is not very clear on the logical details of his probability-raising account of instantial confirmation (stay tuned for both Hempelian and Bayesian precisifications/reconstructions of Nicod’s remarks), three aspects of Nicod’s conception of confirmation are apparent: • Instantial confirmation is a relation between singular and general propositions/statements (or, if you will, between “facts ” and “laws”) ...|$|E
