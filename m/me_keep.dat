2500|$|In November 1927, after {{receiving}} news that Adolph Joffe had committed suicide, he assigned Ukrainian campaigning to Voja Vujović, {{and returned to}} Moscow. Following {{the defeat of the}} Left Opposition in November–December 1927, Rakovsky was ousted from the Comintern, the Central Committee, and eventually from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He was exiled, first to Astrakhan, Saratov, and then to Barnaul. Shortly before the decision, he commented to his visitor, French writer Pierre Naville: [...] "The French expelled me from Paris for having signed a declaration of the opposition.

2500|$|The 1983 {{short film}} Mickey's Christmas Carol marked the {{theatrical}} debut {{of the late}} Wayne Allwine as Mickey Mouse, who {{was the voice of}} Mickey until his death in 2009.

2500|$|Salvation by works—Seventh-day Adventists do {{not believe}} in {{salvation}} by works. Adventist doctrine states that salvation is by faith alone, but they note that faith without works is dead as we find in James 2. In the Gospel of John (John 14:15), Jesus said [...] "If you love <b>me,</b> <b>keep</b> my commandments." [...] Only those who have been born-again and walk in the Spirit (Romans 8:4) could ever love Jesus. Adventists point out that under the New Covenant (as listed in Hebrews chapter 8) the saints receive the Law of God written on the heart and mind, so for the saints keeping His commands is [...] "not burdensome" [...] (1John 5:3). Adventists insist that Christ's command to [...] "keep My Commandments" [...] was not given as a means of salvation, rather, keeping his commands is the fruit of a changed life. As Christ states in John 15 obedience is the result of love. In the Adventist view of sanctification, works of obedience come about as a result of love that is born of faith in the Savior.|$|E
