5|$|The General Society of <b>Mayflower</b> Descendants, or The <b>Mayflower</b> Society, is a genealogical {{organization}} {{of individuals who}} have documented their descents from {{one or more of}} the 102 passengers who arrived on the <b>Mayflower</b> in 1620. The Society, founded at Plymouth in 1897, claims that tens of millions of Americans descend from these passengers, and it offers research services to people seeking to document such descents.|$|E

6000|$|It soon was {{a matter}} of gossip in Spencervale that Chris Stewart was leaving <b>Mayflowers</b> at the beech hollow for the music teacher every other day. Chris himself denied it, but he was not believed. Firstly, there were no <b>Mayflowers</b> in Spencervale; secondly, Chris had to go to Carmody every other day to haul milk to the butter factory, and <b>Mayflowers</b> grew in Carmody, and, thirdly, the Stewarts always had a romantic streak in them. Was not that enough circumstantial {{evidence}} for anybody? ...|$|R

5|$|Alexander {{was born}} about 1626 and died July 6, 1702. He {{was buried in}} Myles Standish Burying Ground in Duxbury, Massachusetts. Alexander married Sarah Alden by about 1660 and had eight children. She died before June 13, 1688. Her father was <b>Mayflower</b> {{passenger}} John Alden. He then married Desire (Doty) (Sherman) Holmes by 1689 and had three children. She died in Marshfield on January 22, 1731. Her father was <b>Mayflower</b> passenger Edward Doty.|$|E

5|$|During the winter, the <b>Mayflower</b> colonists {{suffered}} {{greatly from}} lack of shelter, diseases such as scurvy, and general conditions onboard ship. Many of the able-bodied men were too infirm to work; 45 out of 102 pilgrims died and were buried on Cole's Hill. Thus, only seven residences (of a planned nineteen) and four common houses were constructed during the first winter. By the end of January, enough of the settlement had been built to begin unloading provisions from the <b>Mayflower.</b> In mid-February, after several tense encounters with local Native Americans, the male residents of the settlement organized themselves into military orders; Myles Standish was designated as the commanding officer. By {{the end of the}} month, five cannons had been defensively positioned on Fort Hill. John Carver was elected governor to replace Governor Martin.|$|E
50|$|Two months prior, {{during the}} <b>Mayflower's</b> grand opening party, Jenna and Ryan spiked Eleanor's drink with drugs.

6000|$|... "The other evening Susan {{happened}} {{to say that}} the <b>mayflowers</b> were out in Rainbow Valley. I chanced to be looking at mother when Susan spoke. Her face changed and she gave a queer little choked cry. Most of the time mother is so spunky and gay you would never guess what she feels inside; but now and then some little thing is too much for her and we see under the surface. 'Mayflowers!' she said. 'Jem brought me <b>mayflowers</b> last year!' and she got up and went out of the room. I would have rushed off to Rainbow Valley and brought her an armful of <b>mayflowers,</b> but I knew that wasn't what she wanted. And after Walter got home last night he slipped away to the valley and brought mother home all the <b>mayflowers</b> he could find. Nobody had said a word to him about it--he just remembered himself that Jem used to bring mother the first <b>mayflowers</b> and so he brought them in Jem's place. It shows how tender and thoughtful he is. And yet there are people who send him cruel letters! ...|$|R

5|$|Plymouth Colony did {{not have}} a royal charter authorizing it to form a government, yet some means of {{governance}} was needed. The <b>Mayflower</b> Compact was the colony's first governing document, signed by the 41 able-bodied Separatists aboard the <b>Mayflower</b> upon their arrival in Provincetown Harbor on November 21, 1620. Formal laws were not codified until 1636. The colony's laws were based on a hybrid of English common law and religious law as laid out in the Bible. The colonial authorities were deeply influenced by Calvinist theology, and were convinced that democracy was the form of government mandated by God.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Mayflower</b> first {{anchored}} in {{what became the}} harbor of Provincetown, Massachusetts on November 11, 1620. The ship was headed for {{the mouth of the}} Hudson River near Manhattan, which was part of the Colony of Virginia at the time, but it eventually reached New England.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{so sorry}} for {{people who live in}} lands where there are no Mayflowers," [...] said Anne. [...] "Diana says perhaps they have {{something}} better, but there couldn't be anything better than <b>Mayflowers,</b> could there, Marilla? And Diana says if they don't know what they are like they don't miss them. But I think that is the saddest thing of all. I think it would be TRAGIC, Marilla, not to know what <b>Mayflowers</b> are like and NOT to miss them. Do you know what I think <b>Mayflowers</b> are, Marilla? I think they must be the souls of the flowers that died last summer and this is their heaven. But we had a splendid time today, Marilla. We had our lunch down in a big mossy hollow by an old well--such a ROMANTIC spot. Charlie Sloane dared Arty Gillis to jump over it, and Arty did because he wouldn't take a dare. Nobody would in school. It is very FASHIONABLE to dare. Mr. Phillips gave all the <b>Mayflowers</b> he found to Prissy Andrews and I heard him to say 'sweets to the sweet.' He got that out of a book, I know; but it shows he has some imagination. I was offered some <b>Mayflowers</b> too, but I rejected them with scorn. I can't tell you the person's name because I have vowed never to let it cross my lips. We made wreaths of the <b>Mayflowers</b> and put them on our hats; and when the time came to go home we marched in procession down the road, two by two, with our bouquets and wreaths, singing 'My Home on the Hill.' Oh, it was so thrilling, Marilla. All Mr. Silas Sloane's folks rushed out to see us and everybody we met on the road stopped and stared after us. We made a real sensation." ...|$|R

Said I had a bundle, and winked at the bunch of <b>Mayflowers.</b> We had such a jolly talk that I let the car carry me a block by and had to get out at Gloucester and run back to Exeter. I rang, and, when the maid came to the door, there I stood with nothing but the <b>Mayflowers</b> in my hand." ...|$|R

5|$|From early January 1941 until {{shortly after}} FDR's fourth inauguration in 1945, she {{lived at the}} White House. During her time there, Hickok's nominal address was at the <b>Mayflower</b> Hotel in DC, where she met most people. Also during this time, she formed an intense {{friendship}} with Marion Janet Harron, a United States Tax Court judge who was ten years younger than she and almost {{the only person to}} visit her at the White House.|$|E
5|$|On April 27, 2014, {{three years}} and two days after this tornado, a violent EF4 tornado touched down west of Ferndale and moved along almost the same path as this tornado, causing 16 {{fatalities}} and many injuries. However, it affected more of <b>Mayflower</b> than this tornado did and caused greater damage all along the path, especially in Vilonia, before lifting near El Paso.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Hotel {{was built}} between 1882 and 1887. It had seven floors, 500 rooms {{and a large}} ballroom which has largely survived intact from its {{original}} design.

5|$|The {{ship was}} built in Brixham, England in 1956, and sailed to Plymouth across the Atlantic Ocean in 1957 by famous mariner Alan Villiers. The ship is still seaworthy, and {{routinely}} takes voyages around Plymouth Harbor. In the year 2007, the <b>Mayflower</b> II celebrated the 50th anniversary of its arrival in Plymouth.|$|E
5|$|Using the {{financing}} {{secured from the}} Merchant Adventurers, the Colonists bought provisions and obtained passage on two ships: the <b>Mayflower</b> and the Speedwell. They had intended to leave early in 1620, but they were delayed several months due to difficulties {{in dealing with the}} Merchant Adventurers, including several changes in plans for the voyage and in financing. The congregation and the other colonists finally boarded the Speedwell in July 1620 in the Dutch port of Delfshaven.|$|E
5|$|A regular {{international}} ferry {{service provided}} by Brittany Ferries operates from Millbay taking cars and foot passengers directly to France (Roscoff) and Spain (Santander) {{on the three}} ferries, MV Armorique, MV Bretagne and MV Pont-Aven. The Cremyll Ferry is a passenger ferry between Stonehouse and the Cornish hamlet of Cremyll, which {{is believed to have}} operated continuously since 1204. There is also a pedestrian ferry from the <b>Mayflower</b> Steps to Mount Batten, and an alternative to using the Tamar Bridge via the Torpoint Ferry (vehicle and pedestrian) across the River Tamar.|$|E
60|$|Spencervale {{people were}} wont to say regretfully {{that there were}} no <b>Mayflowers</b> in Spencervale; the Spencervale young fry, when they wanted <b>Mayflowers,</b> thought they had to go over to the barrens at Avonlea, six miles away, for them. Old Lady Lloyd knew better. In her many long, solitary rambles, she had {{discovered}} a little clearing far back in the woods--a southward-sloping, sandy hill on a tract of woodland belonging to a man who lived in town--which in spring was starred over with the pink and white of arbutus.|$|R
60|$|Captain Jim {{came along}} another evening to bring Anne some <b>mayflowers.</b> The garden {{was full of}} the moist, scented air of a {{maritime}} spring evening. There was a milk-white mist {{on the edge of}} the sea, with a young moon kissing it, and a silver gladness of stars over the Glen. The bell of the church across the harbor was ringing dreamily sweet. The mellow chime drifted through the dusk to mingle with the soft spring-moan of the sea. Captain Jim's <b>mayflowers</b> added the last completing touch to the charm of the night.|$|R
60|$|Her eyes brightened {{when she}} saw the <b>mayflowers</b> he carried. She came and took them from him, and her hands touched his, sending a little thrill of joy through him.|$|R
