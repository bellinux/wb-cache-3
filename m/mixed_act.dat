40|$|The {{analysis}} of 2 ̆ 7 mixed acts 2 ̆ 7 in Nicomachean Ethics III, 1 has led scholars to attribute {{a theory of}} 2 ̆ 7 dirty hands 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 impossible oughts 2 ̆ 7 to Aristotle. Michael Stocker argues that Aristotle recognizes particular acts that are simultaneously 2 ̆ 7 right, even obligatory 2 ̆ 7, but nevertheless 2 ̆ 7 wrong, shameful and the like 2 ̆ 7. And Martha Nussbaum commends Aristotle for not sympathizing 2 ̆ 7 with those who, in politics or in private affairs, would so shrink from blame and from unacceptable action {{that they would be}} unable to take a necessary decision for the best 2 ̆ 7. In this paper I reexamine Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s {{analysis of}} putatively 2 ̆ 7 mixed acts 2 ̆ 7 in Nicomachean Ethics III, 1, maintaining that Aristotle denies that there are acts that are (i) voluntary under the circumstances, (ii) right, all things considered, under the circumstances, but nevertheless (iii) shameful or wrong for moral or prudential reasons under the circumstances. The paper defends this interpretation with reference to Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s discussion of shame in EN IV, 9 and Rhetoric II, 6, as well as his overall meta-ethical commitment to a position I call 2 ̆ 7 mitigated circumstantial relativism 2 ̆ 7. By focusing on Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s analysis of putatively 2 ̆ 7 mixed acts 2 ̆ 7, we come closer to a true appreciation of Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s ethical theory, even though 2 ̆ 7 <b>mixed</b> <b>act</b> 2 ̆ 7 is not, I argue, a category in Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s considered ontology of action...|$|E

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of EN III, 1, and particularly {{of the notion}} of “voluntariness” and “involuntariness” is often distorted by the inappropriate overlap of questions deriving from modern moral philosophy. Firstly, this paper presents the scholarly debate on the topics frequently connected with the Aristotelian concepts of eJkousion/ajkousion (determinism/indeterminism, <b>mixed</b> <b>acts</b> and dirty hands theory, <b>mixed</b> <b>acts</b> vs. instrumental acts, role of circumstances, etc.). The next step is the analysis of the relevant passages of EN through a close examination {{of the relationship between the}} notions of “choice” and “voluntariness”: what is crucial for the voluntariness of an action is the individuation of the efficient cause. On this basis it is possible to clarify the role and the significance of <b>mixed</b> <b>acts</b> and of other kinds of actions described by Aristotle. Finally, the topics previously displayed are re-examined in order to shed some light on the distortions arising from the adoption of inadequate lens in interpreting ancient texts...|$|R
