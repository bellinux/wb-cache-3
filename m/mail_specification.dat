50|$|A {{media type}} (also MIME type and content type) is a two-part {{identifier}} for file formats and format contents transmitted on the Internet. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) {{is the official}} authority for the standardization and publication of these classifications. Media types were originally defined in Request for Comments 2045 in November 1996 {{as a part of}} MIME (Multipurpose Internet <b>Mail</b> Extensions) <b>specification,</b> for denoting type of email message content and attachments; hence the name MIME type. Media types are also used by other internet protocols such as HTTP and document file formats such as HTML, for similar purpose.|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the process of specifying a question-answering help facility {{in the context of}} UNIX <b>mail.</b> The <b>specification</b> was bosed upon experimental expert-user facilitative dialogues. These dialogues were analyzed using a classification scheme developed for the purpose. The scheme provides a meta-language for describing patterns of intent and rhetorical structure in dialogue. Using the scheme as a tool, comman patterns in expert-user dialogue emerged, providing insights into both tutoring strategy and the linguistic forms required to generate help output. These were refined to form a set of frames consisting of stereotypical patterns of rhetorical predicates to answer different types of ques-tions which could be adapted to the needs of a particular user. The significance of the system developed from this specification is discussed...|$|R

This document describes a method for compressing the headers of IPX datagrams (CIPX). With this method, {{it is possible to}} significantly improve performance over lower speed wide area network (WAN) media. For normal IPX packet traffic, CIPX can provide a compression ratio of approximately 2 : 1 including both IPX header and data. This method can be used on various type of WAN media, including those supporting PPP and X. 25. This memo ia a product of the Point-to-Point Protocol Extensions (PPPEXT) Working Group of the IETF.

40|$|The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) {{is pleased}} {{to respond to the}} NTIA’s request for {{comments}} on “the upcoming expiration of the Joint Project Agreement (JPA) with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) ” [1]. Our response consists of two key points. First, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is the Standards Development Organization (SDO) responsible for the specification and development of the DNS, TCP/IP, and many other Internet protocols, including major applications protocols such as those for electronic <b>mail.</b> IETF <b>specifications</b> define the formats used by these protocols, such as URLs, URIs, IRIs, AS numbers, and IPv 4 and IPv 6 addresses. In turn the IETF, as the SDO who develops and maintains exactly those protocols for which ICANN has an administrative, security, and stability mandate (as defined by its bylaws and referred to by the JPA [2]), is responsible for taking a proactive role to ensure that critical identifier types meet the stability expectations of both the Internet technical community and the community of users (and other entities) who depend on the Internet. Although the IETF and ICANN operate independently in the Internet environment, the IETF maintains a liaison to the ICANN Board to aid that specific body, and ICANN in general, in understanding the perspectives of the Internet’s development, technical, operational, and user communities. We believe that th...|$|R

While IMAP 4 supports a number of strong authentication mechanisms as described in RFC 1731, it lacks any mechanism that neither passes cleartext, reusable passwords across the network nor requires either a significant security infrastructure or that the mail server update a mail-system-wide user authentication file on each <b>mail</b> access. This <b>specification</b> provides a simple challenge-response authentication protocol that is suitable for use with IMAP 4. Since it utilizes Keyed-MD 5 digests and does not require that the secret be stored in the clear on the server, it may also constitute an improvement on APOP for POP 3 use as specified in RFC 1734. 1...|$|R

The <b>mailing</b> list command <b>specification</b> header fields are a set of structured fields {{to be added to}} email messages sent by email distribution lists. Each field typically contains a URL (usually mailto [RFC 2368]) locating the relevant information or performing the command directly. The three core header fields described in this document are List-Help, List-Subscribe, and List-Unsubscribe. There are three other header fields described here which, although not as widely applicable, will have utility for a sufficient number of mailing lists to justify their formalization here. These are List-Post, List-Owner and List-Archive. By including these header fields, list servers can make it possible for mail clients to provide automated tools for users to perform list functions. This could {{take the form of a}} menu item, push button, or other user interface element.
