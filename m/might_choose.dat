5|$|The French {{government}} {{claimed that}} it had not anticipated that such a massive number would leave; it believed that perhaps 300,000 <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> to depart temporarily and that a large portion would return to Algeria. The administration had set aside funds for absorption of those it called repatriates to partly reimburse them for property losses. The administration avoided acknowledging the true numbers of refugees in order to avoid upsetting its Algeria policies. Consequently, few plans were made for their return, and, psychologically at least, many of the Pieds-Noirs were alienated from both Algeria and France.|$|E
5|$|In June 1873, around 30 {{members of}} the Assiniboine First Nation {{were killed in the}} Cypress Hills Massacre, {{creating}} a national furore. In response, Macdonald used a Privy Council order to enact the new legislation, formally creating the North-West Mounted Police with the intention of mobilising the force and deploying it early the next year. A report then arrived from Alexander Morris, the Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories, blaming the massacre on the activities of whiskey traders at Fort Whoop-Up; Morris predicted that if action was not taken immediately, there would be a major uprising by the First Nations across the region, into which the United States <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> to intervene. Macdonald was not entirely convinced by the governor's analysis, but nonetheless he agreed to recruit 150 men and send them west to Lower Fort Garry before winter weather blocked the route.|$|E
5|$|Sumptuary laws {{regulated}} {{the food}} that one consumed and the clothes that one wore according to status and social class. Clothing was made of hemp or cotton cloths, restricted to a colour standard of black and white. Trousers were the acceptable attire for peasants, soldiers, artisans, and merchants, although wealthy merchants <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> to wear more ornate clothing and male blouses that came down below the waist. Acceptable apparel for scholar-officials was rigidly defined by social ranking system. However, {{as time went on}} this rule of rank-graded apparel for officials was not as strictly enforced. Each official was able to display his awarded status by wearing different-coloured traditional silken robes that hung to the ground around his feet, specific types of headgear, and even specific styles of girdles that displayed his graded-rank of officialdom.|$|E

5000|$|An electoral {{district}} (also {{known as a}} constituency, legislative district, riding, ward, division, electoral area, or electorate) is a territorial subdivision for electing members to a legislative body. Generally, only voters (constituents) who reside within the district are permitted to vote in an election held there. From a single district, a single member or multiple members <b>might</b> be <b>chosen.</b> Members <b>might</b> be <b>chosen</b> by a [...] first-past-the-post system or a proportional representative system, or another voting method entirely. Members <b>might</b> be <b>chosen</b> through a direct election under universal suffrage, an indirect election, or another form of suffrage.|$|R
5|$|The Sejm's great {{achievement}} was {{the adoption of}} the Constitution of May 3, 1791, often described as Europe's first modern written national constitution, and the world's second, after the United States Constitution. The Polish Constitution was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the federative Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and its system of Golden Liberties. The Constitution introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom. The Constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the liberum veto, which at one time had placed a sejm at the mercy of any deputy who <b>might</b> <b>choose,</b> or be bribed by an interest or foreign power, to undo all the legislation that had been passed by that sejm. The May 3rd Constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy fostered by some of the country's reactionary magnates, with a more egalitarian and democratic constitutional monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 63 BC, Hybrida went to Etruria {{to assist}} the praetor, Quintus Metellus Celer, in {{preventing}} Catiline escaping through the Alps and into Gaul. Catiline, hoping that Hybrida <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> to help him, choose to engage him and his consular army rather than the forces under the praetor. Hybrida, however, had given command of the army to his legate, Marcus Petreius, having either suffered a bout of gout or pretending to have. Catiline put up his final resistance in Pistoria, Etruria with an army of 3000 men. Here, Petreius and his soldiers massacred the entire army, killed and beheaded Catiline, and then sent his head to Rome. Hybrida, having adhered to the agreement that he had with Cicero and the Senate, was granted the governorship of Macedonia {{at the end of}} his consulship.|$|E

25|$|Expectancy {{theory has}} been shown to have greater {{validity}} in research in within-subject designs rather than between-subjects designs.

25|$|The fully {{transparent}} {{nature of}} existing ETFs means that an actively managed ETF {{is at risk}} from arbitrage activities by market participants who <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> to front run its trades as daily reports of the ETF's holdings reveals its manager's trading strategy. The initial actively managed equity ETFs addressed this problem by trading only weekly or monthly. Actively managed debt ETFs, which are less susceptible to front-running, trade their holdings more frequently.|$|E
25|$|Heap {{leaching}} is an {{extraction process}} by which chemicals (usually sulfuric acid) are used to extract the economic element from ore which has been mined and placed in piles on the surface. Heap leaching is generally economically feasible only for oxide ore deposits. Oxidation of sulfide deposits occurs during the geological process called weathering. Therefore, oxide ore deposits are typically found close to the surface. If {{there are no other}} economic elements within the ore a mine <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> to extract the uranium using a leaching agent, usually a low molar sulfuric acid.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{responses}} to the uncertainties of global warming is to adopt a strategy of sequential decision making. This strategy recognizes that decisions on global warming need to be made with incomplete information, and that decisions in the near term will have potentially long-term impacts. Governments <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> to use risk management as part of their policy response to global warming. For instance, a risk-based approach can be applied to climate impacts which are difficult to quantify in economic terms, e.g., the impacts of global warming on indigenous peoples.|$|E
25|$|Mouthpiece {{selection}} {{is a highly}} personal decision. Thus, a symphonic trombonist might prefer a mouthpiece with a deeper cup and sharper inner rim shape {{in order to produce}} a rich symphonic tone quality, while a jazz trombonist <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> a shallower cup for brighter tone and easier production of higher notes. Further, for certain compositions, these choices between two such performers could easily be reversed. Some mouthpiece makers now offer mouthpieces that feature removable rims and cups allowing players to further customize and adjust their mouthpiece to their preference.|$|E

40|$|Responsibility demands {{treating}} {{all patients}} in need. The United Declaration of Human Rights claims that individuals {{have the right}} to establish a family (Berg B. 1995). Even though this may seem quite obvious to fertile people, the infertile have to recur to reproductive technologies in order to achieve their complete well-being. We will look at the social, ethical, religious and scientific implications of these new techniques. To begin with, we will analyse some of the social approaches to reproductive technologies. We must not forget that these are treatments that are usually very invasive for women (injections of powerful hormones, surgical procedures, childbirth …). It would then be very interesting to know what women as a gender, including feminists, think of these procedures. One of the most recent advances in assisted reproduction is one that particularly worries feminists. It is the recent possibility of sex selection (through PGD-Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis). On one side, some feminists, like Christine Overall, claim that “sex preferences in the lived experience of close human relationships are not necessarily sexist”. Some feminists see these new possibilities of sex selection as a possible strategy to be used against patriarchy: they <b>might</b> <b>chose</b> to have daughters to oppose male dominance, they <b>might</b> <b>chose</b> boys to raise them in a non-sexist way … However, it is true that in many countries, the desire for boys is particularly notorious, as is the desire for firstborn males.
