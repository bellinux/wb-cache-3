500|$|The Giants {{were founded}} in 1925 by Tim Mara, a {{bookmaker}} (legal in 1925), businessman, and promoter, with {{an investment of}} US$500 after a meeting with league president Joseph Carr, and Harry March. Carr {{was sent to the}} east coast to find someone to put a team in a major city there to help the struggling league. Carr contacted Billy Gibson who was the manager of heavyweight boxer Gene Tunney and knew of Mara from Mara's interest in investing in Tunney. Mara decided to spend the $500 on the Giants as opposed to Tunney in a spur of the moment decision, and started the team with the statement, [...] "an exclusive franchise for anything in New York is worth $500." [...] His son Wellington later said that his father felt that even an empty store in the city was worth that price. Mara purchased the team, despite never having watched a single pro game, saying to the sellers at the time, [...] "Just tell <b>me</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> Now that I have a franchise, what do I do with it." [...] To differentiate themselves from the baseball team of the same name, they took the name [...] "New York Football Giants", which they still use as their legal corporate name.|$|E

I issue that challenge, I issue it to you, I issue it to the Palestinian Authority, I issue it to Noam Chomsky to Edward Said, every word in my book is accurate and you can't just simply say it's false without documenting it. Tell <b>me</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> in the book now that is false? ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{left the}} boat in September 1920. Without a job. Without a future, really. I accidentally met a boy who told me about an {{agricultural}} high school Choctaw County Agricultural High School. I went down and within 10 minutes of getting off the train I'd registered. The old superintendent didn't ask <b>me</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> about my education. He didn't know if I could read or write. Said {{you look like a}} big stout boy. You look like you'd make a good football player. So I was admitted as a football player. I went to that school for four years [...] reasonably basic preparation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I have none!" [...] he declared. [...] "You {{should know}} that--you, Mademoiselle. Life for <b>me</b> means <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> only!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'm not {{speaking}}," [...] {{his wife}} returned, [...] "of {{what she has}} told <b>me.</b> That's <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> I'm speaking of what I know by myself. That's another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{got your}} letter. It was long enough, in all conscience; and, {{long as it}} was, it didn't tell <b>me</b> the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I wanted to know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me," [...] I said; [...] "tell <b>me</b> but <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> of a thousand. Whom {{would you}} seek, did a {{traveller}} direct you, and a boat were at your need?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly. It is what I should {{insist on}} doing myself. I could not {{stay in his}} house under other circumstances. But you too must promise <b>me</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> Emily." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But promise <b>me</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> Do {{you tell}} Mr. Frank what I say--or rather, I'll warrant, if I knew the truth, {{he has said}} the very same thing himself already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{would wish}} you well through it; but I {{believe you are}} eager for the battle. Only let <b>me</b> say <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> Theodora--be forbearing, or you will be {{fostering}} the enemy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mackellar," [...] said he, with a {{wonderful}} return to his old manner and appearance, [...] "you may {{say what you will}} of <b>me,</b> but <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I never was--I was never selfish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All your throuble, sir?" [...] queried the Major; [...] "you mane all my throuble--well, {{and your}} money. And {{a heap of}} throuble that confounded farm has cost <b>me,</b> with <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One moment, Mademoiselle," [...] he said, [...] "before you go {{will you}} tell <b>me</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> at least; was it M. de St. Genis himself who accused me of treachery?" ...|$|E
6000|$|There was no answer, and Sewell stood up. [...] "We don't {{know what}} has happened, boys. Perhaps we never shall; {{but it seems to}} <b>me</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> is certain--it wasn't murder." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Tell <b>me</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> I've often {{wanted to}} know, {{and now you}} speak of it I'll venture to ask. Did you care about me when you read Keats to me last summer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl {{gave her}} a fierce hug; she {{straightened}} herself up, and dashed the water from her eyes. [...] "Well, then," [...] she said, [...] "I'll see. But promise <b>me</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> mother." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't hurry <b>me.</b> For <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> I suppose I've {{gone too}} far in my {{knowledge}} of women. I've gone beyond the capability of being bamboozled. I see {{too much of the}} ropes and props that do sustain the pasteboard rosetree." ...|$|R
