40|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} how local land and natural {{resource}} <b>management</b> <b>organisations</b> in Scotland help to build community resilience. This paper identifies the resilience theory to be interrelated with vulnerability and adaptive capacity. Three communities with land and natural resource <b>management</b> <b>organisations</b> were examined for their adaptive capacity which was explored through the social capitals framework. This paper finds that three communities in Scotland with land natural resource <b>management</b> <b>organisations</b> exhibit higher levels of social capital than UK/Scotland social capital levels as a whole. This paper also finds that local land and natural resource <b>management</b> <b>organisations</b> are addressing community risks and vulnerabilities through their aims, projects and goals. The Scottish Government and the larger international development field has emphasised the importance of building strong, resilient and supportive communities. Understanding where resilience comes from, {{and how it is}} built, is important in moving forward on these goals. The results of this study show that land and natural resource <b>management</b> <b>organisations</b> in Scotland are actively helping build more resilient communities...|$|R

40|$|Malaysian {{government}} has implemented various incentives {{to encourage the}} MNCs to set up their plant and operations in Malaysia. The expansion programmes of these MNCs in Malaysia {{have resulted in a}} heavy inflow of foreign workers from third world and developing countries. As a result of that, it has created a great opportunity for hostel <b>management</b> <b>organisations</b> to serve the market. Based on observation, managing the lodging and accommodation for foreign workers appeared to be the most troublesome to the hostel <b>management</b> <b>organisations.</b> This is because the foreign workers employed were from different culture and background which requires special knowledge and skills in hostel management. Besides that most of the hostel <b>management</b> <b>organisations</b> do not own a hostel building for hostel business operations. This has created an additional problem to the hostel <b>management</b> <b>organisations.</b> As a result, it generates enough interest for it to be investigated further. For this purpose, two objectives have been formulated for this study. The first objective is to identify the problems faced by the hostel <b>management</b> <b>organisations</b> when they do not own a purpose-built building for hostel operation. The second objective is to identify the problems faced by the Management Corporation in managing the building facilities when {{a large portion of the}} multi-storey building is used as hostel. Research population for this study are segmented into three different groups, namely hostel <b>management</b> <b>organisation,</b> hostel occupants and Management Corporation. Data collected for this study were analysed using Frequency Analysis and Likert Scaling. Findings of this study conclude that hostel <b>management</b> <b>organisations</b> do have problems when operating in a non-purpose built building for hostels. Similarly, Management Corporation also faces several problems when portions of units in their complex are being used as hostels. This study also highlights the advantages and disadvantages of using apartment as hostel for foreign workers which appeared to be a good reference for other apartments in Johor Bahr...|$|R
