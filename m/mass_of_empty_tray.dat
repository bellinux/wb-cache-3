40|$|Human {{chromosomes}} are {{riddled with}} sequence elements that {{have in our}} evolutionary past reproduced and "jumped" to new locations. Long Interspersed Nuclear Element 1 (L 1) is the only human autonomous retrotransposon thought to be currently active. L 1 retrotransposition has significantly shaped our genome via insertional mutagenesis, sequence transduction, pseudogene formation, and ectopic recombination. However, L 1 retrotransposition dynamics are little understood in the germline since de novo insertions occur infrequently (one event genome-wide per 16 [...] 500 haploid genomes). Also, a lack of germline cell cultures requires techniques that can directly access de novo retrotransposition in sperm DNA.;Hybridisation enrichment was used to capture rare L 1 containing DNA from an aliquot of multiplex amplified DNA. Enrichment was achieved by the binding of biotinylated oligonucleotides (bio-oligos) to L 1 sequences and their physical retrieval using streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. Using bio-oligos on total sperm DNA would be futile due to L 1 comprising âˆ¼ 17 % by <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> the genome. The search area was therefore limited to genomic sections (âˆ¼ 5 kb) devoid of matches to the bio-oligo sequences. PCR had to be extremely efficient as a de novo insertion would appear once {{in a pool of}} sperm DNA. Multiplex PCR could amplify full length L 1 insertions into âˆ¼ 5 kb target sites to levels of recoverable by hybridisation enrichment from single molecules, despite the presence <b>of</b> overwhelming <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> target sites.;After screening âˆ¼ 600 microg of sperm DNA, I propose a rate (within previous estimates) of < 3 insertions in 290 haploid genomes. This low rate of insertion may not be inconsistent with ongoing L 1 proliferation. Rather the data supports the idea that L 1 s may retrotranspose rarely during embryogenesis before germline differentiation. Such "jackpot" insertions colonise numerous gametes, and thus have a greater chance of being inherited, even if this only occurs in very few individuals...|$|R

This Article seeks to bring theoretic and programmatic coherence to the idea of an American OS, in hopes of generating an enduring and endurable version of it. The Article first identifies three political traditions that amount to our self-understandings as a people. An enduring American OS must resonate with those traditions. The Article then synthesizes a unified self-understanding from the three traditions - a coherent set of constitutive ideals that contour what the Article calls an Efficient Equal-Opportunity Republic (EEOR). The EEOR is the template for an endurable American OS. The Article then fleshes out the bare bones of the EEOR.

It does so second by deriving a 2 ̆ 2 Method 2 ̆ 2 of financially engineered ownership-spreading that gives full expression both to the aforementioned core values and to the psychological and legal constraints. The Article concludes with a preview of its sequel, which catalogues and critically examines past OS programs and proposals under the aspect of the theory worked out in the present Article, and elaborates a coherent set of forward-looking ownership-promoting programs informed by the lessons that emerge from that critical encounter...|$|R

The <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> the stage transfer hardware such as initiators and safe-and-arm devices are very small by comparison and can be considered negligible.

Thus, the maximum seismic design force, i.e., the most unfavorable condition is obtained in corresponding of the maximum possible liquid fill height in the sphere, that is when the fluid mass tends to behave like an impulsive mass and sloshing effects become negligible.|$|R
