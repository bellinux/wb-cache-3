40|$|In {{the last}} decade the {{interest}} for liquefied natural gas (LNG) is growing. A tendency is to produce and transport LNG on large floating vessels. One important choice in designing such a vessel is the liquefaction process. Several processes have been developed in recent years, ranging from <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerants</b> processes, <b>cascade</b> processes and expander processes. Using knowledge and experience from onshore LNG liquefaction plants, the different processes can be rated to the relevance for offshore operations. Little quantitative information {{is available in the}} open literature and therefore a large number of questions remain open. TNO, a Dutch contract research, technology development and consultancy organization, has started an investigation of the rationale with respect to offshore functionalities like small footprint, efficiency, flexibility and robustness, safety, availability, and sensitivity to ship motions. The most promising candidates are the nitrogen expander processes for small capacities and the single or dual <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> processes. The latter two processes are more sensitive to ship motions, mainly due to the type of heat exchanger (spiral wound heat exchanger). Tilting the spiral wound heat exchanger lead to a significant maldistribution of the cooling liquid on the shell side...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{examined}} the energy optimal operation of representative natural gas liquefaction cycle processes such as propane precooled <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> (C 3 MR) process, dual <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> (DMR) process, and modified single <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> (MSMR) process. Steady-state optimality analysis in dynamic simulation environment was conducted to explore the operational behavior of each cycle. From this analysis, a steady-state optimality map that describes the relation between cost function and decision variable is obtained. By exploring this map a promising optimizing variable is discovered which further {{can be used to}} develop an energy optimizing control structure for the liquefaction process. Despite the same basic working principles, the operational behavior of the three cycles is dissimilar. The DMR has the narrowest optimal operation range while in the MSMR cycle the optimum value of cost function spans in relatively wide range of decision variable. The feasible operation of C 3 MR and DMR is bounded by the suction temperature of <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> compressor while in the MSMR cycle this constraint is inactive. Based on the steady-state optimality analysis the temperature difference between the warm-end inlet and outlet MR streams (TD) were proposed to be a promising optimizing variable for the C 3 MR and DMR process while for the MSMR process the optimizing variable is the flow rate ratio of heavy and light <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> (HK/LK ratio) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{optimization}} of a <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> liquefaction {{process is}} a challenge because of its non-linear characteristics with stringent multiple process constraints. This study proposes a novel hybrid approach for the optimization of a newly developed, modified single <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> process of natural gas liquefaction targeted for offshore applications. This contribution focuses on interpreting the geometric pattern of a plot of the temperature difference between the hot and cold composite curves in a cryogenic heat exchanger to understand the profound effects of the flow rates of the individual refrigerant components and the operating pressure on the liquefaction efficiency. From this, an effective method to generate a proper initial approach temperature profile was developed to ensure robust convergence of the main optimization step. An enhanced coordinate descent methodology was implemented in the main optimization procedure to accelerate the optimization of the modified single <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> liquefaction process. The proposed knowledge-inspired hybrid optimization approach showed a robust convergence on determining the optimal design condition. The total energy requirement for natural gas liquefaction cycle was reduced by 21. 9 % compared to the base case. The proposed methodology can be extended directly to solve optimization problems for other <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> based natural gas liquefaction processes...|$|R
40|$|As the {{worldwide}} energy consumption continues to grow, {{natural gas and}} especially LNG are expected to keep contributing significantly with this growth. More than 95 % of the installed LNG facilities use a precooling cycle as {{the first stage of}} the liquefaction process. In this work, a technical comparison between different precooling cycles for LNG processes is carried out through computational simulations using Aspen HYSYS&# 174;. The aim is to provide future project developments with a clear idea of the technical advantages/disadvantages involved in the selection of the process for the precooling cycle in LNG processes. The precooling circuit is treated as a stand-alone cycle first and then implemented in an entire liquefaction process; the propane precooled <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> (C 3 MR) and the mixed fluid cascade (MFC&# 174;) processes are used for this purpose. The parameters studied are essentially coefficient of performance (&# 946;), heat exchanger UA value, compressor power, suction volumetric flow and pressure ratio. Two cases, cold (6 &# 176;C) and warm (25 &# 176;C) climate conditions are considered for each study. A three stage propane precooled process was found to be the most energetically efficient among the studied cases, even better than a two stage <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> process (C 2 /C 3) for both climate conditions; however, the performance in terms of energy consumption is not the only parameter taken into account and therefore a selection chart is provided. Under warm climate conditions a propane precooling circuit showed to be the most recommended process. For cold climates, however, a two stage <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> cycle reaching ca. - 50 &# 176;C is the preferred alternative, since in this case the low ambient temperature gives the propane precooled process a low share in the entire process. Other cases, such as a single stage <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> cycle and a <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> including n-Butane are taken into account. Based on the obtained results, a new, highly efficient configuration for natural gas liquefaction has been suggested, it is to be implemented in relatively warm climate conditions. It consists of a MFC&# 174; process with modifications in the liquefaction cycle and a propane precooling instead of the <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> circuit; no previous reference in the open literature was found for such arrangement. </p...|$|R
40|$|The gas {{expander}} processes {{have attracted}} growing interest for FLNG facilities due to utilization of non-flammable fluids i. e. nitrogen as refrigerant and simplicity in configuration and operation. New {{developments of the}} processes show that the efficiency is getting closer to the established <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> or <b>cascade</b> processes. The objective of this thesis is to do a fair and consistent comparison between three proposed expander process schemes for FLNG i. e. the MODEC/APCI process, the LINDE/SBM process and the CB&I/Randall with ?Niche? process. Each process was evaluated on the same basis for capacity, air temperature, cooling water temperature, heat exchanger sizing and component efficiencies. The DMR process was also used as the baseline. The analysis was primarily done using HYSYS and ASPEN-plus simulation programs {{in combination with the}} literature study. In general all the expander-based processes evaluated clearly have a disadvantage in term of process efficiency and capacity when they are compared to the DMR process. The primary difference concerns the power generation where one additional gas turbine is necessary for the expander-based process {{in order to get the}} intended capacity of 3 MTPA LNG production. However, the expander-based processes are excellent in safety and simpler in operation, which may offset this drawback particularly for FLNG operation. The Niche process, particularly the one with the precooling system, has the highest process efficiency among the expander processes. The evaluation reveals that in general we need higher complexity to achieve higher process efficiency. The MODEC/APCI process has the largest number of equipment units, and is considered as the most complex process and the heaviest one. The opposite of the MODEC/APCI process, the Linde/SBM is the simplest one, but it has the lowest process efficiency. The MODEC/APCI occupy more space due to the use of Coil Wound Heat Exchanger (CWHE), which is considered to be less compact than Plate Fin Heat Exchanger (PFHE), larger piping system due to low pressure and vacuum operation, and the higher need for cooling water giving a larger and more complex utility system. The Niche process may have smaller footprint due to smaller size of the pipes and utilization of compact PFHE. The use of CWHE in the MODEC/APCI is safer because it provides double containment. This is an advantage that offset the drawback in footprint aspect. In contrary, the Niche process is the lowest in term of safety among the expander-based processes due to the use of PFHE, which provides only single containment, and hydrocarbon as refrigerant even though only in gas phase. Each process has unique advantages over the others, and there are some trade-offs and compromises among efficiency, simplicity and safety. The process selection will therefore depend on the specifics of a particular FLNG project. </p...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to model a single <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> process for offshore natural gas liquefaction using ASPEN HYSYS as a simulation tools. The liquefaction process employed in this part {{is a result of}} modification of previous case done by C. W. Remeljeja and A. F. A. Hoadley (2004). This work is divided into two sections. First is to model the PRICO LNG process that published result. Second is to improve the model by adding the mixer in the <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> stream after the separator. It allows two different phase of gas and liquid of <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> to <b>mix</b> together before entering the LNG Heat Exchanger (cold box). The mixer also helps to maintain a constant flow rate of the stream to the cold box. The results are obtained after the system is converged. When modeling the PRICO process in Aspen Hysys,certain variables such as temperature and pressure at the streams entering and leaving the cold box cannot be changed directly. This will cause temperature cross and change of <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> phase in the respected stream. As a result,by doing structural modification on the basic PRICO process specifically in case 3,the load duty of the compressor can be lowered significantly. After three different structural modifications discussed in this paper, the compressor duty to liquefy the natural gas can be reduced down to 82300. 46 kW when compared to the base case. As a conclusion,structural modification in case 3 is the best model when compare case 1 and case 2 because it operates in lowest compressor duty. For the future improvement,a different structure modification can be done using case 3 as a base model,for example replacing the valve with a multiphase expander to generate electricity in this LNG liquefaction process...|$|R

40|$|Export of Marcellus Shale Gas The Marcellus Shale {{natural gas}} field that spans from West Virginia to New York is leading the recent surge in {{domestic}} energy production. Long an importer of natural gas, the United States will {{soon be able to}} export natural gas.

40|$|In J-T cryocoolers {{operating}} with <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerants</b> (nitrogen-hydrocarbons), the recuperative heat exchange takes place under two-phase conditions. Simultaneous boiling {{of the low}} pressure stream and condensation of the high pressure stream results in higher heat transfer coefficients.

In this work, a one-dimensional transient algorithm is developed for the simulation of the two-phase heat transfer in the recuperative heat exchanger of a <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> J-T cryocooler. Modified correlation is used for flow boiling of the high pressure fluid while different condensation correlations are employed with and without the correction for the low pressure fluid. Simulations are carried out for different mixture compositions and numerical predictions are compared with the experimental data. The overall heat transfer is predicted reasonably well and the qualitative trends of the temperature profiles are also captured by the developed numerical model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|While it is cost {{effective}} to liquefy natural gas for storage, transport, and use, roughly 10 to 15 {{percent of the}} gas gets consumed during the process. The optimal process contains four stages of propane refrigeration and two stages of ethylene refrigeration.

Efficiency can be tied to the pure component cascade processes which minimize the overall source to sink temperature difference associated with refrigerant condensing.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to perform a technical-exergetic analysis of a large-scale hydrogen liquefaction system. The system boundary of the technical analysis is isolated to the precooling {{part of the overall}} process, which gives potential for extensive Case Study Analysis and benchmark possibilities of present conventional systems. From a hydrogen precooling point of view, the predictions for long- and mid- term development options for a large-scale liquefaction scenario (50 - 200 tpd), tends towards <b>Mixed</b> <b>Refrigerant</b> and Nitrogen Cycles, both in combination of simple, high-efficiency chillers in the upper temperature region. Four different Case Study Models has been simulated in Aspen HYSYS, optimized and re-modified with emphasis on the net exergy destruction within the entire process model, the overall exergy efficiency defined by the system boundary and specific energy consumption of the isolated system. The two baseline models has been adapted from the Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) industry, where the utilization rate of <b>Mixed</b> <b>Refrigerants</b> has a high level of experience. The two precooling processes are the Single <b>Mixed</b> <b>Refrigerant</b> (PRICO) process and the <b>Cascade</b> <b>Mixed</b> <b>Refrigerant</b> process. The precooling systems are simulated both in combination with and without integration of R 290 -Chillers (propane) and with additional cooling of a generic nelium stream as cryogenic working fluid. Recent concepts of complete liquefac- tion systems, propose to perform heat integration of the cryogenic fluid into the precooling process, in favour of heat transfer minimization. Hence, a process with integrated cryogenic working fluids creates a better framework model, easier to adapt into a bigger system for future work. Each of the Case Study models were optimized by employment of simulation iterations i, where the best performing simulation from each Case Study Model was benchmarked with a conventional Liquid Nitrogen Precooling process.

Current systems utilize multiple compressors leading to high energy consumption. Equipment operating costs contribute significantly to the total operating costs of biotechnology companies and therefore motivate {{the development of more}} efficient alternatives for low temperature refrigeration. This paper describes a single compressor R- 23 /R- 134 a <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> cycle that has been designed to extract a load of 0. 256 kW (873. 5 Btu/hr) from a conditioned space at - 80 °C (- 112 °F). The designed system compresses a mixture of the gaseous refrigerants to a high pressure and then condenses the R- 134 a in a water-cooled separator while the R- 23 remains in vapor phase. The stream of liquid R- 134 a is expanded to the suction pressure and is used to condense the R- 23 that remains in vapor phase, operating much like an inter-stage heat exchanger in a cascade cycle. The condensed stream of R- 23 then expands to the suction pressure and enters a low-temperature evaporator, where it absorbs energy from the load. A model of the cycle is developed based upon first and second law principles of thermodynamics and used to refine the design of a <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> test apparatus.

The objective of the Master thesis work was to analyze {{of the interaction between}} the WMR condenser and the DMR system, focusing on evaluation of the consequences for varying operating parameters and a realistic degree of differential condensation. The evaluations were performed by developing flow sheet models in Hysys in collaboration with HTRI program and literature references. The materials used as design basis for simulation were based on data from Statoil. Based on the simulation results, differential condensation model in Hysys would give a realistic number of about less than 3 % uncondensed vapor (mole fraction) at the outlet of WMR condenser, which may result in higher temperature at design pressure 46. 45 bar or lower pressure at design temperature 22 oC at the outlet of WMR condenser. As a consequence, the specific work would be slightly increased, which means the power efficiency of DMR process would be decreased. This 3 % of uncondensed vapor due to differential condensation could be reduced and eliminated by one of these alternatives: increasing the condensing pressure from 46. 95 bar to 47. 95 bar, reducing 15 % flow rate of WMR, feed NG and CMR, reducing methane fraction from WMR composition and lowering sub-cooling temperature by utilizing lower cooling water inlet temperature, if it is available.

40|$|The {{comparison}} of the marine refrigerating machine work and their ele-ments on the ozone-saving <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerants</b> R 410 A, R 407 C and ozone-depleting R 22 is {{made on the basis}} of the exergic analysis. The parameters of the marine refrigerating machine work such as specific refrigerating capacity, exergy, exergy losses in the refrigerating machine units, exergic coefficient of efficiency are calculated. The graphics of these parameters dependence on the boiling-point and condensation are made. It is stated that the use of the refrigerants R 407 C and R 410 A as an alternative of R 22 leads to the increase of the exergy losses in all refrigerating machine units...|$|R
40|$|Spiral wound heat {{exchangers}} with horizontal tube configurations are used {{extensively in the}} chemical, refrigeration, petroleum and food industry, and are core components in many natural gas liquefaction plants. For improved understanding of these {{heat exchangers}}, it is of vital importance to predict the liquid flow characteristics between the pipes. In this work, the flow between horizontal tube configurations with different dimensions relevant for LNG heat exchangers was experimentally characterized. N-pentane and methanol were used as test liquids in the experiments. N-pentane has similar properties to LNG and typical <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerants</b> of LNG processes.

40|$|AbstractSINTEF Energy Research {{have for}} several years worked with a plant concept for small scale LNG {{production}} {{in the range from}} 5 to 20 tonnes per day. This process, called Mini-LNG, is based on <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> and standard refrigeration components such as oil lubricated screw compressor and plate heat exchangers. The design has emphasized low costs and high robustness. In this master thesis, written in cooperation with SINTEF, production of LNG at a rate from 20 to 100 tonnes per day has been reviewed. The feed could be for instance associated gas. Focus has been put on evaluating existing processes, both <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> and nitrogen expansion. Four criteria have been highlighted as increasingly important namely; operation and reliability, specific power consumption, cost and complexity and production rate. In order to evaluate the thermodynamic efficiency, the most interesting processes were simulated in the program PRO/II. Initial values were gathered from a literature survey. An exergy analysis was made to quantify the losses is each component. The assumptions were feed gas at 40 bar at a Norwegian climate with sea water temperature of 15 &# 176;C. It is not accounted for pressure drop losses in the heat exchangers and other equipment. This is due to uncertainly of two-phase pressure drop modeling and the thought of the simulations only to be considered as a benchmark. A novel LNG process has been proposed, based on the concept of SINTEF Mini-LNG, but with improved efficiency. The novel process includes a phase separator, two turbo compressors and several brazed plate heat exchangers. Through simulations it was calculated that is has lower specific power consumption than existing small scale LNG processes evaluated in this report. The exergy efficiency is over 40 percent, which is considered to be relatively high. At the given conditions this corresponds to specific power consumption slightly above 325 kWh/tonne. As the process is based on simulations, only further work can state if it can be realized. Uncertainty is linked with the size of the plate heat exchangers which may not be available, but perhaps can be tailor-made. The easiest <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> process, PRICO, was calculated to have an exergy efficiency of 37 percent vs. 27 percent for the most advanced nitrogen dual expansion process, cLNG. Instability and maldistribution of <b>mixed</b> <b>refrigerant</b> in multichannel heat exchangers is a problem that can obstruct normal operation and reduce the plant efficiency. So called Ledinegg-instability is a problem that leads to uneven distribution of refrigerant in the channels due to several possible flow solutions. This is visualized as an N-shaped curve when plotting pressure drop versus mass flow. Simulation in Aspen Plate+ and S-Plate gave no clear answer to whether this may appear in the plate heat exchangers for the novel process. More work must be done in validating the models used for simulation. The complete evaporation progress has been compared with that of PRICO. The novel process was briefly evaluated for use for liquefaction of associated gas offshore. More work must be done to clarify the area footprint and plant components. It is unlikely to build such as plant on an FPSO unless it is included in a retrofit design. A more probable alternative is to place a plant on small floaters adjacent to existing FPSOs for oil and LPG production. An economic feasibility study must also be made in order to evaluate costs and income for operation after plateau production. </p...|$|R
