5|$|On {{the night}} 12 November, the three ships met and formed into line; {{the attack was}} {{scheduled}} to begin {{on the morning of}} 14 November with a bombardment from the warships. The crews of Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser were to form a landing party to seize the harbor. The flotilla arrived {{on the morning of the}} 13th. The following morning, the landing party of some 700 officers and men was landed on the <b>main</b> <b>pier</b> in the harbor. The Chinese were caught completely by surprise, and the Germans secured their objectives within two hours; Diederichs convinced the Chinese commander, General Chang, to withdraw from Kiaochou. The Imperial flag was raised in the town and Prinzess Wilhelm fired a 21-gun salute. The landing party remained in Kiaochou to garrison the port, and several 3.7cm guns were removed from the ships to provide artillery to the force.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} February 28, 2005, in Palos Verdes, beginning with Elizabeth's ruined wedding day. The crew {{spent the first}} shooting days at Walt Disney Studios in Los Angeles, including the interiors of the Black Pearl and the Edinburgh Trader which Elizabeth stows away on, before moving to St. Vincent to shoot the scenes in Port Royal and Tortuga. Sets from the previous film were reused, having survived three hurricanes, although the <b>main</b> <b>pier</b> had to be rebuilt as it had collapsed in November. The crew had four tall ships at their disposal to populate the backgrounds, which were painted differently on each side for economy. One of the ships used was the replica of HMS Bounty used in the 1962 film adaptation of Mutiny on the Bounty.|$|E
25|$|During the 2010 earthquake, the Port-au-Prince port {{suffered}} widespread damage, impeding {{aid to the}} victims. The <b>main</b> <b>pier</b> {{caved in}} and fell into the water. One of the main cranes also collapsed in the water. Port access roads were severely damaged as well.|$|E

50|$|After {{a partial}} failure {{in one of}} the piers during September, 1920, caused by poor cement, the {{presence}} of humus in the aggregate and the low temperature of the air and water, special measures were resorted to in placing concrete in <b>main</b> <b>piers.</b>|$|R
25|$|The south <b>main</b> <b>pier</b> (the {{one that}} {{required}} reinforcement before completion) withstood the ship strike without significant damage. It {{was the second}} pier {{to the south of}} it that was destroyed, a secondary pier that was not designed to withstand a large ship strike.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{opening of the}} central and <b>main</b> <b>pier</b> {{of what is now}} the South Terminal, with 11 aircraft stands, was on 9 June 1958. Gatwick was one of the world's first airports with an enclosed pier-based terminal, which allowed passengers to walk under cover to waiting areas near the aircraft (with only a short walk outdoors). Another feature of Gatwick's new air terminal was its modular design, permitting subsequent, phased expansion.|$|E
25|$|The present bridge {{replaced}} a steel {{cantilever bridge}} of the same name. The original two-lane bridge built by the Virginia Bridge Company was opened to traffic on September 6, 1954, with a similar structure built parallel and {{to the west of}} it in 1969 to make it a four-lane bridge and bring it to Interstate Highway standards. Opening of the newer span was delayed until 1971 for reinforcing of the south <b>main</b> <b>pier,</b> which had cracked due to insufficient supporting pile depth. The second span was used for all southbound traffic, while the original span was converted to carry northbound traffic.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the William Jolly Bridge was {{intended}} to reflect the city's importance and its civic pride. Constructed of concrete encased steel, the bridge has a monument-like quality, with grotesques and representations of oversized coursing on the <b>main</b> <b>piers</b> and voussoirs on the arched ribs.|$|R
5000|$|The Victoria and Alfred Basins: These {{were the}} <b>main</b> <b>piers</b> of the {{original}} Cape Town harbour, but now house the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront. However, these basins are still used by smaller commercial vessels such as fishing and pleasure boats and also by smaller passenger cruise ships.|$|R
2500|$|It is a {{multi-span}} balanced {{cantilever bridge}} with a post-tensioned concrete box girder structure. Most of the curved bridge is [...] above {{water with a}} [...] navigation span for ship traffic. The bridge rests on 62 piers, of which the 44 <b>main</b> <b>piers</b> are [...] apart. The bridge is [...] wide.|$|R
500|$|The <b>main</b> <b>pier</b> was {{originally}} [...] long, {{and it is}} [...] wide with a cantilever construction. However the low water jetty was damaged in a storm in 1903, rebuilt in 1909 and finally dismantled in 1923 meaning that the pier is now [...] long, Due to architectural features such as abutments {{at either end of}} the pier, the pier resembles a bridge more than other pleasure piers. Fifteen groups of piles support a continuous lattice girder, each set comprising four piles screwed into the river bed at an angle with an X-brace between each adjacent pair. The fitting of screw blades to iron piles, as opposed to the then accepted wooden pile, created a deeper and far more resilient base support. This was one of the innovations brought by Eugenius Birch which have enabled many of the piers he designed to survive. There were problems with oscillations in the structure when bands marched on the pier, both on the opening day and again in 1886. As a result, further horizontal cross braces were added to the piles, and a law was passed banning marching on the pier. The gothic toll house and pierhead buildings were designed by local architect Hans Price.|$|E
2500|$|Vasikkasaari [...] {{was used}} as a fuel and {{ammunition}} depot of Krepost Sveaborg. The island is located in Kruunuvuorenselkä where the inner anchorage of the fortress was, between Suomenlinna, Santahamina and Laajasalo. Three large fuel oil tanks served the naval base and two smaller diesel tanks provided fuel for the mine company (later battalion) ships of the fortress. A pumping station powered by steam engine was connected to the tanks. Eight storage magazines housed weapons, ammunition, mines and torpedoes with a narrow gauge railway built on the island connecting them to the <b>main</b> <b>pier.</b> At {{the start of the war}} a 57mm quick fire battery was located on the island, replaced by a 75mm anti-aircraft battery in spring 1915. The anti-aircraft battery was relocated in summer 1916. A 90cm searchlight was also located on the island.|$|E
2500|$|The works {{covered a}} [...] site {{to the south}} of the Northern Outfall Sewer, between Woolwich Manor Way and the Thames. The company had {{considered}} several sites for the works. The site to the west of Barking Creek was selected as it was possible to build deep water piers in the Thames, enabling direct unloading from steam colliers bringing coal from mines in the North-East of England. There were two piers, for importing coal and exporting by-products. In the 1930s an annual average of a million tons of coal mainly from Durham was unloaded at the <b>main</b> <b>pier,</b> with a further 750,000 tons transhipped to barges for other works. The GLCC had a fleet of seventeen coastal colliers ranging from 1,200 to 2,841 gross register tons, and also chartered larger ships as needed. At this time the plant had a coal storage capacity of 250,000 tons.|$|E
50|$|Saint John Harbour Bridge was {{designed}} and built as a hollow box, haunched girder structure. It carries four lanes traffic across 3 spans, measuring 125 m, 250 m, and 125 m. Contracts for the four <b>main</b> <b>piers</b> were signed in September 1965 and the crossing opened on August 17, 1968 {{as part of the}} ambitious Saint John Throughway project.|$|R
50|$|The {{port area}} has three <b>main</b> <b>piers,</b> {{one of which}} is able to handle medium to large sized {{container}} and passenger craft while the others deal with the smaller passenger and dive boats that serve the islands of Ko Pha Ngan, Ko Samui, and Ko Tao, and the mainland ports at Surat Thani and Chumphon, the latter connecting with bus service to Bangkok.|$|R

He received a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering from Oregon State University in 1936. He was Student Body President at OSU during his Senior Year and served in the Reserve Officers Training Corps.|$|R
6000|$|... § IV. When this shaft, {{brought from}} roof to ground, is {{subordinate}} to the <b>main</b> <b>pier,</b> and either is carried down the face of it, or forms no {{large part of the}} group, the principle is Romanesque or Gothic, b, Fig. XXXVI. When it becomes a bold central shaft, and the <b>main</b> <b>pier</b> splits into two minor shafts on its sides, the principle is Classical or Palladian, c, Fig. XXXVI. Which latter arrangement becomes absurd or unsatisfactory in proportion to the sufficiency of the main shaft to carry the roof without the help of the minor shafts or arch, which in many instances of Palladian work look as if they might be removed without danger to the building.|$|E

50|$|The {{airside area}} will be {{accessible}} only to ticketed and screened passengers. Securitas Germany will staff the 35 screening stations. BER is equipped with 25 jet bridges, with another 85 aircraft stands on the apron. The boarding and arrival areas are divided into three piers with the <b>main</b> <b>pier</b> at 715 m long and {{the north and south}} piers at 350 m each. The <b>main</b> <b>pier</b> contains 16 jet-bridges; all but one have two levels, thus separating arriving and departing passengers. Level 1 is intended for Schengen passengers (gates A01-A20, B01-B20), while Level 2 (gates C01-C19, D01-D17) is for non-Schengen passengers. Eight of the gates can accommodate wide-body aircraft and one gate has been designed to accommodate the Airbus A380, the largest commercial airliner currently in use. The apron has sufficient space to allow installation of a dual jetway allowing a quick boarding and disembarking process. A mezzanine (Level Z) at gates A21-22 and B21 allows for additional pre-boarding security checks for high-risk flights to the United States and Israel. Air Berlin, Lufthansa and Air France/KLM will operate airport lounges in the <b>main</b> <b>pier,</b> which will also be open for passengers of the respective alliance partners.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a regular}} ship {{navigation}} through the lake, mouth of Ili River and Kapchagay Reservoir. The <b>main</b> <b>piers</b> are Burylbaytal and Burlitobe. The ships are relatively light due to the limiting depth {{in some parts of}} the lake; they are used mainly for catching fish and transporting fish and construction materials. The total length of the waterway is 978 km, and the navigation period is 210 days/year.|$|R

The span of the arches varies slightly, as each was {{constructed}} independently to provide flexibility to protect against subsidence. Each level has a differing number of arches: ...|$|R
5000|$|It was {{the first}} iron truss bridge {{to be built in}} New South Wales, and was {{designed}} by William Bennett, Engineer and Commissioner for Roads [...] and constructed by Francis Bell. [...] The trusses were assembled from iron work imported from England and the cast-iron cylinders for the <b>main</b> <b>piers</b> were cast at the Fitzroy Iron Works at Mittagong. The pin-jointed Warren truss section is the second-oldest metal truss bridge in Australia.|$|R

60|$|But {{the moment}} that the {{conditions}} of weight are comprehended, both truth and feeling require that the conditions of support should be also comprehended. Nothing can be worse, either as judged by the taste or the conscience, than affectedly inadequate supports--suspensions in air, and other such tricks and vanities. Mr. Hope wisely reprehends, for this reason, {{the arrangement of the}} <b>main</b> <b>piers</b> of St. Sophia at Constantinople. King's College Chapel, Cambridge, is a piece of architectural juggling, if possible still more to be condemned, because less sublime.|$|R
50|$|Total {{length of}} the steel bridge is 1,526.4 meters, of which 1,134,7 meters is over the river bed. The height of the <b>main</b> {{supporting}} <b>piers</b> is 18 meters.|$|R
50|$|The south <b>main</b> <b>pier</b> (the {{one that}} {{required}} reinforcement before completion) withstood the ship strike without significant damage. It {{was the second}} pier {{to the south of}} it that was destroyed, a secondary pier that was not designed to withstand a large ship strike.|$|E
50|$|The {{town has}} a general store about a 10-minute {{walk from the}} <b>main</b> <b>pier.</b> The pier {{is known for its}} fishing and there are many scenic walking tracks along the beach and through the bushland. There is also bird {{watching}} available with many exotic and local species.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a small}} {{hospital}} on Phi Phi Island for emergencies. Its main purpose is to stabilize emergencies and evacuate to a Phuket hospital. It is between the Phi Phi Cabana Hotel and the Ton Sai Towers, about a 5-7 minute walk from the <b>main</b> <b>pier.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of steel trusses and timber trusses {{in the same}} bridge {{is considered to be}} justified by the high price of bridge steel and concrete work at the time of construction, it being cheaper to build all approach spans of timber and to make provision for possible renewal with steel and concrete when the life of the timber has reached its limit. For this reason the <b>main</b> <b>piers</b> were designed to support 200-ft. steel flanking spans at some future time, each to replace the present 121-ft. and 70-ft. spans.|$|R
50|$|In {{planning}} the nave, {{a system of}} supports was adopted not unlike that {{to be seen in}} most Gothic cathedrals, where huge, yet narrow, buttresses are projected at intervals, and stiffened by transverse walls, arcading and vaulting. Unlike in a Gothic cathedral, at Westminster they are limited to the interior. The <b>main</b> <b>piers</b> and transverse arches that support the domes divide the nave into three bays, each about 395 m2. The domes rest on the arches at a height of 27 m from the floor, the total internal height being 34 m.|$|R
50|$|The new bridge {{provides}} 185 ft {{of vertical}} navigational clearance for oceangoing vessels. Its horizontal clearance is 1023 ft, with both <b>main</b> <b>piers</b> {{located on the}} north and south banks of the Savannah River. With a main span of 1100 ft and a total length of 1.9 mi, the new Talmadge Memorial carries four lanes of traffic. The north end of the bridge ends on Hutchinson Island, an island situated between the Savannah River and the Back River. A separate, older, two-lane bridge spans Back River, connecting Hutchinson Island with Jasper County, South Carolina.|$|R
