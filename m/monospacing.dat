40|$|Parts of {{computer}} programs are reproduced in this MS using a TYPEWRITER-like monospaced typeface. It {{is important that}} these be set using <b>monospacing,</b> and that the indentation and interword spacing in these blocks be reproduced as given. Also, {{we have made a}} careful distinction between the ad-jective &quot;Cray &quot; (always with first letter capitalized) a. nd the computer designa-tion &quot;CRAY &quot; (always all upper case). We have followed exactly the usage recom-mended by Cray Research Inc. and the text should be set following this usage...|$|E
50|$|It is a <b>monospaced</b> variant. 3 widths {{have been}} produced. All fonts use hanging <b>monospaced</b> figures.|$|R
50|$|<b>Monospace</b> is a <b>monospaced</b> Unicode font, {{developed}} by George Williams. It {{is based on}} the typeface Courier.|$|R
50|$|It is a <b>monospaced</b> variant. Each weight only {{includes}} roman and italic. All fonts use hanging <b>monospaced</b> figures.|$|R
25|$|<b>Monospaced</b> typefaces {{function}} {{better for}} some purposes because their glyphs {{line up in}} neat, regular columns. No glyph is given any more weight than another. Most manually operated typewriters use <b>monospaced</b> fonts. So do text-only computer displays and third- and fourth-generation game console graphics processors, which treat the screen as a uniform grid of character cells. Most computer programs which have a text-based interface (terminal emulators, for example) use only <b>monospaced</b> fonts (or add additional spacing to proportional fonts to fit them in <b>monospaced</b> cells) in their configuration. <b>Monospaced</b> fonts are commonly used by computer programmers for displaying and editing source code so that certain characters (for example parentheses used to group arithmetic expressions) are easy to see. <b>Monospaced</b> fonts may also {{make it easier to}} perform optical character recognition.|$|R
50|$|The {{failure of}} a {{proportional}} font to reproduce the desired boxes above motivates <b>monospaced</b> fonts' use in the creation and viewing of ASCII and ANSI art. Some poetry composed <b>monospaced</b> on typewriters or computers also depends on the vertical alignment of character columns. E. E. Cummings' poetry is often set in <b>monospaced</b> type for this reason. Some classic video games (e.g. Nethack) and those imitating their style (e.g. Dwarf Fortress) use a <b>monospaced</b> grid of characters to render their state for the player.|$|R
50|$|Inconsolata is an {{open-source}} font {{created by}} Raph Levien and released under the SIL Open Font License. It is a humanist <b>monospaced</b> font designed for source code listing, terminal emulators, and similar uses. It {{was influenced by}} the proprietary Consolas <b>monospaced</b> font, designed by Lucas de Groot, the proportional Avenir and IBM's classic <b>monospaced</b> Letter Gothic.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Monospaced</b> fonts {{that mimic}} {{the look of}} a {{typewriter}} have the same width for all characters. Some of these fonts have em and en dashes that more or less fill the <b>monospaced</b> width they have available. For example, the sequence [...] "hyphen, en dash, em dash, minus" [...] shows as [...] "" [...] in a <b>monospace</b> font.|$|R
50|$|It is a <b>monospaced</b> variant with ragged strokes. It {{included}} fonts {{in regular}} and bold weights in the widest TheSansMono width, with complementary italic fonts. It uses hanging <b>monospaced</b> figures.|$|R
50|$|The <b>monospace</b> version, used in terminals, was {{initially}} planned to ship with Ubuntu 11.04. However it was delayed and instead shipped with Ubuntu 11.10 as the default system <b>monospace</b> font.|$|R
50|$|GenEi Gothic M (源暎ゴシックM): Based on Gen Shin Gothic <b>Monospace.</b> In {{addition}} to common change, modified versions half-width glyphs from Gen Shin Gothic <b>Monospace</b> is used, outline format {{was changed to}} TrueType.|$|R
5000|$|ASCII art usually {{requires}} a <b>monospaced</b> font for proper viewing, {{with the exception}} of Shift JIS art which takes advantage of the proportional characters in the MS PGothic font. In a web page, the [...] , [...] or [...] HTML tags most commonly specify <b>monospaced</b> fonts. In LaTeX, the verbatim environment or the Teletype font family (e.g., \texttt{...} or {\ttfamily ...}) uses <b>monospaced</b> fonts (in TeX, use {\tt ...}).|$|R
25|$|<b>Monospaced</b> fonts are typefaces {{in which}} every glyph is the same width (as opposed to variable-width fonts, where the w and m are wider than most letters, and the i is narrower). The first <b>monospaced</b> typefaces were {{designed}} for typewriters, which could only move the same distance forward with each letter typed. Their use continued with early computers, which could only display a single font. Although modern computers can display any desired typeface, <b>monospaced</b> fonts are still important for computer programming, terminal emulation, and for laying out tabulated data in plain text documents; {{they may also be}} particularly legible at small sizes due to all characters being quite wide. Examples of <b>monospaced</b> typefaces are Courier, Prestige Elite, Fixedsys, and Monaco. Most <b>monospaced</b> fonts are sans-serif or slab-serif as these designs are easiest to read printed small or display on low-resolution screens, though many exceptions exist.|$|R
5000|$|Fixedsys is {{a family}} of raster <b>monospaced</b> fonts. The name means fixed system, because its glyphs are <b>monospace</b> or fixed-width (although bolded {{characters}} are wider than non-bolded, unlike other <b>monospace</b> fonts such as Courier). It is the oldest font in Windows, and was the system font in Windows 1.0 and 2.0, where it was simply named [...] "System". For Windows 3.x, the system font was changed to a proportional sans-serif font named System, but Fixedsys remained the default font in Notepad.|$|R
25|$|A {{proportional}} typeface contains glyphs {{of varying}} widths, while a <b>monospaced</b> (non-proportional or fixed-width) typeface uses a single standard width for all glyphs in the font. Duospaced fonts {{are similar to}} <b>monospaced</b> fonts, but characters can also be two character widths instead of a single character width.|$|R
50|$|Gen Shin Gothic (源真ゴシック (げんしんゴシック))/Gen Shin Gothic P (源真ゴシックP)/Gen Shin Gothic <b>Monospace</b> (源真ゴシック等幅): It is {{a version}} of Source Han Sans in TrueType outline, {{addition}} of proportional kana (Gen Shin Gothic P) and half-width (Gen Shin Gothic <b>Monospace)</b> kana fonts, removal of Chinese and Korean-specific phonetic symbols.|$|R
50|$|Classic family {{includes}} all 8 font weights, with roman, italic, small caps roman, small caps italic, expert, expert italic in each weight. It includes hanging proportional, hanging <b>monospaced,</b> lining proportional, lining <b>monospaced</b> figures; and additional f-ligatures. Expert fonts include arrows, swashes, fraction figures, alternate styles, mathematic symbols, ornaments.|$|R
50|$|Most ASCII art {{is created}} using a <b>monospaced</b> font, where all {{characters}} are identical in width (Courier {{is a popular}} <b>monospaced</b> font). Early computers in use when ASCII art came into vogue had <b>monospaced</b> fonts for screen and printer displays. Today most of the more commonly used fonts in word processors, web browsers and other programs are proportional fonts, such as Helvetica or Times Roman, where different widths are used for different characters. ASCII art drawn for a fixed width font will usually appear distorted, or even unrecognizable when displayed in a proportional font.|$|R
50|$|Figures: <b>monospaced</b> numerals; {{diagonal}} serif on the 1; closed 4.|$|R
50|$|In June, 2014, Bigelow & Holmes {{released}} four weights: Light, Normal, Bold, and Black, {{in three}} styles: Roman, Italic, and Oblique. B&H also released Narrow versions of those twelve weight/styles, plus four Lucida Grande <b>Monospaced</b> fonts in Regular, Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic styles, with narrow {{versions of the}} four <b>monospaced</b> weight/styles.|$|R
50|$|Multiple {{art forms}} have {{developed}} within computers' and typewriters' <b>monospaced</b> typographic settings {{in which the}} nth character of every line align vertically with each other. (Such a group of characters is sometimes called a column.) A proportional and <b>monospaced</b> font's reproduction of an element of ANSI art, line drawing, is illustrated below.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a family}} {{supporting}} Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, CJK ideographic, Japanese kanam, Korean Hangul syllables, Thai characters. The family includes 5 fonts in 1 (medium) width, with 4 proportional an 1 <b>monospaced</b> fonts. The proportional fonts are in 4 weights (bold, medium, regular, light), while the <b>monospace</b> font is in medium weight.|$|R
5000|$|Even though {{computers}} can now display {{a wide variety}} of fonts, the majority of IDEs and software text editors employ a <b>monospaced</b> font as the default typeface. This increases the readability of source code, which is often heavily reliant on distinctions involving individual symbols, and makes differences between letters more unambiguous in situations like password entry boxes where typing mistakes are unacceptable. [...] <b>Monospaced</b> fonts are also used in terminal emulation and for laying out tabulated data in plain text documents. In technical manuals and resources for programming languages, a <b>monospaced</b> font is often used to distinguish code from natural-language text.|$|R
50|$|<b>Monospaced</b> fonts are {{customary}} on typewriters and for {{typesetting computer}} code.|$|R

25|$|In the {{publishing}} industry, {{it was once}} the case that editors read manuscripts in <b>monospaced</b> fonts (typically Courier) for ease of editing and word count estimates, and it was considered discourteous to submit a manuscript in a proportional font. This has become less universal in recent years, such that authors need to check with editors as to their preference, though <b>monospaced</b> fonts are still the norm.|$|R
