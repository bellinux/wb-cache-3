2500|$|This {{code was}} invented in 1880 by Sir William Watson Rutherford (1853–1927). [...] At the time, the British Post Office did not allow digits or ciphers in telegrams, but they did allow Latin words. [...] This method also allowed moves for two games to be {{transmitted}} at the same time. [...] In this method, the legal moves in the position were counted using a system until the move being made was reached. This was done for both games. [...] The <b>move</b> <b>number</b> of the first game was multiplied by 60 and added to the <b>move</b> <b>number</b> of the second game. [...] Leading zeros were added as necessary to give a four-digit number. [...] The first two digits would be 00 through 39, which corresponded to a table of 40 Latin roots. [...] The third digit corresponded {{to a list of}} 10 Latin prefixes and the last digit corresponded to a list of 10 Latin suffixes. [...] The resulting word was transmitted.|$|E

2500|$|Some special {{methods of}} {{notation}} {{were used for}} transmitting moves by telegraph or radio, usually using Morse Code. [...] The Uedemann code and Gringmuth notation worked by using a two-letter label for each square and transmitting four letters – two letters for the origin square followed by two letters for the destination square. [...] Castling is shown as a king move. [...] Squares are designated from White's side of the board, files {{from left to right}} and ranks from nearest to farthest. [...] The Rutherford code first converted the move into a number and then converted the <b>move</b> <b>number</b> into a composite Latin word. [...] It could also transmit moves of two games at the same time.|$|E
50|$|Progressive chess, like {{orthodox}} chess, is notated with algebraic notation. However, the numbering {{of moves}} is handled slightly differently. Rather than one White and one Black move being given under each <b>move</b> <b>number</b> (leading to notation in orthodox chess like 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6), each turn by each player is given its own <b>move</b> <b>number</b> (leading to notation in progressive chess like 1.e4 2.e5 Nf6 3.Bc4 Qh5 Qxf7#). In this way, the <b>move</b> <b>number</b> {{is equal to}} the number of moves in a series available to a player on that turn.|$|E

50|$|The movetext {{describes}} the actual moves of the game. This includes <b>move</b> <b>number</b> indicators (numbers followed by either one or three periods; one {{if the next}} move is White's move, three if the next move is Black's move) and movetext Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN).|$|E
5000|$|When {{listing the}} moves of a game, first the <b>move</b> <b>number</b> is written, then the move by White {{followed}} by the move by Black. If there's no appropriate White move to use (e.g., if the moves are interrupted by commentary) then an ellipsis ... is used in its place.|$|E

5000|$|The {{position}} of the bit change in the Gray code solution gives {{the size of the}} disk moved at each step: 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, ... a sequence also known as the ruler function, or one more than the power of 2 within the <b>move</b> <b>number.</b> In the Wolfram Language, [...] gives moves for the 8-disk puzzle.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike western notation, {{numbering}} Japanese game records is not obligatory. Although players' <b>moves</b> often aren't <b>numbered,</b> shogi <b>moves</b> {{are always}} counted per player's move. This is commonly seen in checkmate problems where a 3-move ３手 checkmate problem {{would mean a}} move sequence of black-white-black. This is unlike western chess which counts each pair of moves as one move. (In western notation for shogi, the <b>move</b> <b>numbering</b> tends to follow western chess notation conventions.) ...|$|R

5000|$|There are {{a number}} of {{variations}} on SPGs. The problem may carry a stipulation similar to [...] "Find a game with 8.b7-b8=N mate", which simply means a game must be constructed starting from the initial position and ending on the given <b>move</b> <b>number</b> with the given move. Or it may be a one-sided proof game, in which only white makes moves (this is the SPG analogue to the seriesmover in other types of chess problems). An alternative rule-set may also be specified (such as circe chess or losing chess), or a fairy piece may be substituted for an orthodox piece.|$|E
50|$|Like in most {{tactical}} RPGs, {{each character}} {{has a certain}} <b>move</b> <b>number</b> and can attack at a certain distance. Most party members can only attack at close range, unless {{he or she has}} a long-range skill. Each character can also equip three accessories and use items. The game features some normal status problems (sleep, paralysis, etc.) like in most console RPGs, but has some original ones too, such as frog and philanthropy. Each enemy also has an element (thunder, wind, earth, fire, water, dark, holy) and a weakness to the opposite element. Each element has its own set of spells, which can be used to take advantage of such weaknesses.|$|E
