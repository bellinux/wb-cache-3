5|$|The Drexler–Smalley {{debate on}} <b>molecular</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> {{was a public}} dispute between K. Eric Drexler, the {{originator}} of the conceptual basis of <b>molecular</b> <b>nanotechnology,</b> and Richard Smalley, a recipient of the 1996 Nobel prize in Chemistry for {{the discovery of the}} nanomaterial buckminsterfullerene. The dispute was about the feasibility of constructing molecular assemblers, which are molecular machines which could robotically assemble molecular materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules. The concept of molecular assemblers was central to Drexler's conception of <b>molecular</b> <b>nanotechnology,</b> but Smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from ever being possible. The two also traded accusations that the other's conception of nanotechnology was harmful to public perception of the field and threatened continued public support for nanotechnology research.|$|E
25|$|While {{conventional}} chemistry uses inexact processes obtaining inexact results, {{and biology}} exploits inexact processes to obtain definitive results, <b>molecular</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> would employ original definitive processes to obtain definitive results. The desire in <b>molecular</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> {{would be to}} balance molecular reactions in positionally-controlled locations and orientations to obtain desired chemical reactions, and then to build systems by further assembling the products of these reactions.|$|E

25|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>nanotechnology,</b> {{sometimes}} called molecular manufacturing, describes engineered nanosystems (nanoscale machines) {{operating on the}} molecular scale. <b>Molecular</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> is especially associated with the molecular assembler, a machine that can produce a desired structure or device atom-by-atom using the principles of mechanosynthesis.

25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, the field {{garnered}} increased scientific, political, and commercial attention {{that led to}} both controversy and progress. Controversies emerged regarding the definitions and potential implications of nanotechnologies, exemplified by the Royal Society's report on nanotechnology. Challenges were raised regarding the feasibility of applications envisioned by advocates of <b>molecular</b> <b>nanotechnology,</b> which culminated in a public debate between Drexler and Smalley in 2001 and 2003.|$|E
25|$|Nanotechnology (or <b>molecular</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> {{to refer}} more {{specifically}} to the goals discussed here) will let us continue the historical trends in manufacturing {{right up to the}} fundamental limits imposed by physical law. It will let us make remarkably powerful molecular computers. It will let us make materials over fifty times lighter than steel or aluminium alloy but with the same strength. We'll be able to make jets, rockets, cars or even chairs that, by today's standards, would be remarkably light, strong, and inexpensive. Molecular surgical tools, guided by molecular computers and injected into the blood stream could find and destroy cancer cells or invading bacteria, unclog arteries, or provide oxygen when the circulation is impaired.|$|E
500|$|Drexler's {{vision of}} nanotechnology, now called <b>{{molecular}}</b> <b>nanotechnology,</b> {{is based on}} the concept of the molecular assembler, a molecular machine which would manufacture molecules and molecular devices atom-by-atom. Drexler drew a distinction between wet nanotechnology based on biological systems, and [...] "second-generation" [...] dry nanotechnology which would be based on mechanosynthesis, positional control of molecules through principles more related to mechanical engineering. Drexler and his followers have focused almost exclusively on the latter form of <b>molecular</b> <b>nanotechnology,</b> but Drexler has stated that both are valid pathways to creating molecular machine systems.|$|E

500|$|The debate's {{focus on}} the public {{perception}} of nanotechnology has also received commentary. Political blogger Glenn Reynolds stated that [...] "the business community is afraid that advanced nanotechnology just seems too, well, spooky—and worse, that discussions of potentially spooky implications will lead to public fears that might get into the way of bringing products to market." [...] Lawrence Lessig criticized the scientific establishment, represented by Smalley, for arguing that [...] "if so-called dangerous nanotech can be relegated to summer sci-fi movies and forgotten after Labor Day, then serious work can continue, supported by billion-dollar funding and uninhibited by the idiocy that buries, for example, stem cell research." [...] Kurzweil wrote that Smalley's approach to reassuring the public would backfire because it denied both the benefits and risks of <b>molecular</b> <b>nanotechnology.</b>|$|E
500|$|K. Eric Drexler is {{generally}} considered to have written the first scholarly paper {{on the topic of}} nanotechnology, and was a key figure in popularizing these concepts through several publications and advocacy work. [...] Trained as an engineer, Drexler was inspired by a then-obscure 1959 talk by physicist Richard Feynman called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, which posited that it should be physically possible to manipulate individual atoms using top-down engineering methodologies. Drexler was also inspired by recent advances in molecular biology such as recombinant DNA technology. In a 1981 publication in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, considered to be the first journal article on nanotechnology, he argued that biological systems such as the ribosome were already capable of building molecules atom-by-atom, and that artificial machines with this capability could also be constructed. Drexler went on to publish two books on nanotechnology: Engines of Creation in 1986, which was intended for the public, and the technical work Nanosystems in 1992. He also co-founded the Foresight Institute, a public interest group devoted to increasing public awareness and information about <b>molecular</b> <b>nanotechnology.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Some {{feel that}} <b>molecular</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> would have {{daunting}} risks. It conceivably could enable cheaper and more destructive conventional weapons. [...] Also, <b>molecular</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> might permit {{weapons of mass}} destruction that could self-replicate, as viruses and cancer cells do when attacking the human body. Commentators generally agree that, in the event <b>molecular</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> were developed, its self-replication should be permitted only under very controlled or [...] "inherently safe" [...] conditions.|$|E
