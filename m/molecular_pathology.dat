5|$|During the 1990s, the {{identification}} of newly discovered genes and new techniques for DNA sequencing led to {{the appearance of a}} distinct field of molecular and genomic laboratory medicine; in 1995, the Association for <b>Molecular</b> <b>Pathology</b> (AMP) was formed to give it structure. In 1999, the AMP co-founded The Journal of Medical Diagnostics. Informa Healthcare launched Expert Reviews in Medical Diagnostics in 2001. From 2002 onwards, the HapMap Project aggregated information on the one-letter genetic differences that recur in the human populationthe single nucleotide polymorphismsand their relationship with disease. In 2012, molecular diagnostic techniques for Thalassemia use genetic hybridization tests to identify the specific single nucleotide polymorphism causing an individual's disease.|$|E

Myriad's business model of exclusively offering the diagnostic test led from Myriad being a startup in 1994 to being a publicly traded company with 1200 employees and about $500M in annual revenue in 2012; it also led to controversy over high prices and the inability to get second opinions from other diagnostic labs, which in turn led to the landmark Association for <b>Molecular</b> <b>Pathology</b> v.

While heterogeneity of such magnitude would appear to represent a major impediment to the development of therapeutics, mutation-independent approaches to therapy are being developed to effectively by-pass such diversity in genetic aetiology. The implications of such technologies in terms of therapeutic intervention in RP, and indeed other genetically heterogeneous conditions, will be addressed...|$|R

25|$|In {{more severe}} cases of type 1 vWD, genetic changes are common within the vWF gene and are highly penetrant. In milder cases of type 1 vWD, a complex {{spectrum}} of <b>molecular</b> <b>pathology</b> may exist {{in addition to}} polymorphisms of the vWF gene alone. The individual's ABO blood group can influence presentation and pathology of vWD. Those individuals with blood group O have a lower mean level than individuals with other blood groups. Unless ABO group–specific vWF:antigen reference ranges are used, normal group O individuals can be diagnosed as type I vWD, and some individuals of blood group AB {{with a genetic defect}} of vWF may have the diagnosis overlooked because vWF levels are elevated due to blood group.|$|E

25|$|While most {{molecular}} epidemiology studies are still using conventional disease diagnosis and classification systems, {{it is increasingly}} recognized that disease evolution represents inherently heterogeneous processes differing from person to person. Conceptually, each individual has a unique disease process {{different from any other}} individual (“the unique disease principle”), considering uniqueness of the exposome (a totality of endogenous and exogenous / environmental exposures) and its unique influence on molecular pathologic process in each individual. Studies {{to examine the relationship between}} an exposure and molecular pathologic signature of disease (particularly cancer) became increasingly common throughout the 2000s. However, the use of <b>molecular</b> <b>pathology</b> in epidemiology posed unique challenges including lack of research guidelines and standardized statistical methodologies, and paucity of interdisciplinary experts and training programs. Furthermore, the concept of disease heterogeneity appears to conflict with the long-standing premise in epidemiology that individuals with the same disease name have similar etiologies and disease processes. To resolve these issues and advance population health science in the era of molecular precision medicine, “molecular pathology” and “epidemiology” was integrated to create a new interdisciplinary field of “molecular pathological epidemiology” (MPE), defined as “epidemiology of <b>molecular</b> <b>pathology</b> and heterogeneity of disease”. In MPE, investigators analyze the relationships between; (A) environmental, dietary, lifestyle and genetic factors; (B) alterations in cellular or extracellular molecules; and (C) evolution and progression of disease. A better understanding of heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis will further contribute to elucidate etiologies of disease. The MPE approach can be applied to not only neoplastic diseases but also non-neoplastic diseases. The concept and paradigm of MPE have become widespread in the 2010s.|$|E

30|$|Furthermore, {{multispectral}} optical imaging is a {{step forward}} towards implementation in the clinic of the recently introduced concept of <b>molecular</b> fluorescence <b>pathology,</b> as a cost-effective, time-efficient and sensitive technique, complementary to conventional IHC. Direct fluorescence imaging of the VHHs conjugated to NIR fluorophores already present in the tumour tissue would require no further costly lab processing, but only sectioning of the tissue blocks and subsequent imaging. This <b>molecular</b> fluorescent <b>pathology</b> would, however, strongly depend on the imaging target and probably be restricted to cell surface markers that are accessible to VHHs.|$|R
30|$|Different from HGPS-MSCs, HGPS-ECs did not display any premature {{senescence}} phenotypes, {{consistent with}} previous observations in HGPS-iPSC-derived ECs (Zhang et al., 2011). Similarly, WS-ECs did not show aging defects, either. These {{results indicate that the}} senescence-associated defects caused by LMNA mutation or WRN deficiency are cell-type-specific (Fig.  10). However, further analyses show that these cells were not otherwise normal; HGPS-ECs and WS-ECs were more apoptotic at baseline than WT-ECs. Moreover, WS-ECs, but not HGPS-ECs, exhibited a more pronounced response to inflammatory factor TNF-α, again indicating different <b>molecular</b> <b>pathologies</b> between the two progeroid syndromes.|$|R

Myriad Genetics (No. 12-398), the US Supreme Court unanimously ruled that, [...] "A naturally occurring DNA segment {{is a product of}} nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated," [...] invalidating Myriad's patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. However, the Court also held that manipulation of a gene to create something not found in nature could still be eligible for patent protection. [...] The Federal Court of Australia came to the opposite conclusion, upholding the validity of an Australian Myriad Genetics patent over the BRCA1 gene in February 2013, but this decision is being appealed and the appeal will include consideration of the US Supreme Court ruling.|$|E
500|$|A patent {{application}} for the isolated BRCA1 gene and cancer-cancer promoting mutations, {{as well as}} methods to diagnose the likelihood of getting breast cancer, was filed by the University of Utah, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and Myriad Genetics in 1994; [...] over the next year, Myriad, in collaboration with other investigators, isolated and sequenced the BRCA2 gene and identified relevant mutations, and the first BRCA2 patent was filed in the U.S. by Myriad and the other institutions in 1995. [...] Myriad is the exclusive licensee of these patents and has enforced them in the US against clinical diagnostic labs. [...] This business model led from Myriad being a startup in 1994 to being a publicly traded company with 1200 employees and about $500M in annual revenue in 2012; it also led to controversy over high prices and the inability to get second opinions from other diagnostic labs, which in turn led to the landmark Association for <b>Molecular</b> <b>Pathology</b> v.
