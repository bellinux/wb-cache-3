The importance of having timely and reliable information on the <b>B.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>P.</b> statistics in a small and open economy receives even more weight by the prospect of joining the EU and remaining two years in the ERM 2 (European Exchange Rate Mechanism 2). The paper describes a project of implementing a direct reporting system for the <b>B.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>P.</b> items: commercial credits, foreign direct investments and accounts abroad. The decision-making process was supported by a simulation technique also focusing on the possibilities to develop similar systems for other items of the <b>B.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>P.</b> The results encourage us to employ high technologies which also demands a significantly higher level of knowledge. Compared to the current data sources, some doubts remain as to whether the quality of the reported data meets the requirements...|$|R

It is inherently a multi-faceted concept that cannot be easily defined; any chosen definition is likely to change over time as new aspects gain importance following the evolving users 2 ̆ 019 needs. The {{purpose of this paper}} is threefold; (1) to present a number of quantitative quality indicators, (2) to apply them to measure the quality of balance of payments (<b>b.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>p.)</b> data at the euro area level, and (3) to identify various aspects of data quality that may be enhanced, together with their interrelations with other quality dimensions. The indicators used are compatible with the IMF Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF), as defined for <b>b.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>p.</b> statistics, focusing mainly on revisions and consistency. The results obtained from such quantitative indicators may help compilers to set priorities in order to improve the quality of the euro area data still further in dimensions such as accuracy, reliability and serviceability. Additionally, this assessment may help users to understand better the quality of the data, to anticipate the possible size and direction of the forthcoming revisions, and to evaluate the impact of using different datasets in their analysis...|$|R

Bacteriotherapy with the concept of using good bacterial strains to replace the pathogenic ones emerged as a fascinating field due to the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate if a particular combination of probiotics (Lactobacillus Reuteri DSM 17938 and Lactobaciullus Reuteri ATCC PTA 5289) is useful in treating gingivitis in diabetic patients. Eighty adult patients with diagnosis of controlled diabetes type II and gingivitis were enrolled for this study and randomized in two groups. Only oral hygiene instructions were given. Bacteriotherapy (Lactobacillus Reuteri) was administered to test group. Outcome measures were presence of Plaque (P.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to assess {{during the winter}} feeding period the effects of replacing grass silage (G) with whole-crop barley silage (B) or whole-crop oat silage (O) on suckler cow and calf performance. Forty-eight Hereford cows with an initial live weight of 741 kg (S. D. 78. 5) were selected for the experiment. The diet was either G, <b>B</b> or <b>O</b> as a sole feed. The aim was to offer the cows {{the same amount of}} energy in all diets. Therefore, the energy content of the silages was evaluated prior to the experiment by measuring the in vitro organic matter digestibility which resulted in 11. 7 MJ metabolizable energy (ME) /kg dry matter (DM) for G and 9. 9 MJ ME/kg DM for <b>B</b> and <b>O.</b> During the experiment, the digestibility of the silages was measured by both in vitro and in vivo methods. The ME values of G, <b>B</b> and <b>O</b> evaluated by the in vivo method were 11. 2, 10. 5 and 9. 5 MJ/kg DM, respectively. The DM intake on diets G, <b>B</b> and <b>O</b> averaged 9. 2, 10. 5 and 10. 3 kg which resulted in ME intakes of 102, 109 and 97 MJ ME/d, respectively. The type of roughage affected the in vivo apparent protein digestibility co-efficients which for G, <b>B</b> and <b>O</b> were 0. 841, 0. 698 and 0. 498, respectively (G versus B, P < 0. 05; G versus <b>O</b> and <b>B</b> versus <b>O,</b> <b>P</b> < 0. 01). The initial cow body condition score (BCS) averaged 3. 2 (S. D. 0. 23). Pre-grazing the change of BCS and the live weight gain (LWG) for G, <b>B</b> and <b>O</b> cows was on average 0. 23, 0. 09 and - 0. 39 (G versus <b>O</b> and <b>B</b> versus <b>O,</b> <b>P</b> < 0. 001) and - 20, - 9 and - 56 kg (G versus <b>O,</b> <b>P</b> < 0. 05; <b>B</b> versus <b>O,</b> <b>P</b> < 0. 01), respectively. All calves were born before the grazing season and milk and grass were the sole feeds at pasture. The pre-weaning calf LWG was not affected by the diets averaging 1357 g/d. The daily milk yield on diets G, <b>B</b> and <b>O</b> averaged 11. 4, 10. 3 and 9. 5 kg (G versus <b>O,</b> <b>P</b> < 0. 05), respectively. Forty-two out of 48 cows entered the mating period of which all were observed to be pregnant. The interval from calving to conception averaged 89 days. <b>B</b> and <b>O</b> proved to be suitable winter feeds for mature suckler cows in cold winter circumstances. Especially O had a lower energy and protein content than G but fulfilled the energy and protein demands of mature, pregnant beef cows in good body condition. v 2005 o...|$|R

The discarded oil was purified with a brine solution and bleached with H 2 O 2. Purified bleached discarded palm oil (<b>P.</b> <b>B.</b> D. <b>P.</b> <b>O.)</b> was mixed with two materials commonly used in toilet soap manufacturing, i. e., inedible tallow (I.

The data revealed that using <b>P.</b> <b>B.</b> D. <b>P.</b> <b>O.</b> up to 30 % as a substitute for I.

The soap samples containing more than 30 % <b>P.</b> <b>B.</b> D. <b>P.</b> <b>O.</b> as a substitute for I. T. gave bad quality. After the storage of soap samples for 6 months at room temperature, significant improvements in the physical properties of the soap samples at different ratios were found. It could be recommended that discarded palm oil from chip frying factories can be used after purification and bleaching in place of inedible tallow up to 30 % to produce a fine toilet soap.
