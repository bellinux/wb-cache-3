25|$|The P.A.B.C. {{initiative}} (Public Art Building Communities), {{has allowed}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> {{bridge between the}} community, the Restaurant Mama Ayesha’s, the arts {{and all the people}} who have made this mural a reality. This could not be done without the support of all the community and the help of the DC Commission and the Restaurant and all the entities who funded the project. I hope that this mural will become a teaching tool of the History of the Presidents for schools, children and the public in general. This is a gift to the City of Washington DC to celebrate this historical moment in American History and will remain open to the public to see for generations to come. This is fulfilling the idea that mural art is available for the public and for the masses.|$|E
500|$|As the Chili Peppers' {{contract}} with EMI {{came to an}} end, they began {{looking for a new}} record company to release their next album. The group reached a consensus to go with Sony BMG/Epic, with the proviso that they buy out their last album from EMI. Even though the label promised it would take only a few days, the process stretched out into several months. Although a deal had been made with Sony/Epic, Mo Ostin of Warner Bros. Records called Kiedis to congratulate him on the successful deal, and complimented the rival record label. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "The coolest, most real person we had met during all these negotiations had just personally called to encourage <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> great record for a rival company. That was the kind of guy I'd want to be working for." [...] The group pursued the idea, and eventually dropped the {{contract with}} Sony in favor of a deal with Warner Bros. Ostin called an old friend at EMI, who immediately allowed for the label transfer.|$|E
500|$|... "In the Dark" [...] {{was written}} by Dev {{alongside}} The Cataracs, a group that consists of Niles Hollowell-Dhar and David Singer-Vine, who also produced the track. Dev described the song as [...] "very flavorful" [...] and [...] "hot". In an interview with music blog Idolator, she talked in-depth about the conception of the song, stating, [...] "The idea behind 'In The Dark' was for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> sexy song. I'm a grown woman now. I've been working with The Cataracs {{for the past three}} years and I met them when I was kind of young and from a small town. I was like, dammit, I'm gonna make a sexy song! So that's what I did." [...] She explained that she wanted the song to be [...] "tasteful, yet sexual" [...] and described it as [...] "very sexy, but very musical at the same time". She said, [...] "The songs I had before, even though they were explicit to an extent, they were just fun. It was time when we just wanted to make that sort of record, and we did. It's probably one of the sexier songs on the record, but I think it needed that!" [...] "In the Dark" [...] was recorded during a session in January 2011; it was one of the first songs to be recorded for Dev's debut album and it was eventually also recorded by Demi Lovato. It was later mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Studios in Los Angeles, California and mastered by Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound in New York City.|$|E

The governor refused to see or listen to him, even after Bouazizi was quoted as saying, [...] "If you don't see me, I'll burn myself." [...] Bouazizi then acquired a can of gasoline from a nearby gas station {{and returned to the}} governor's office.

2500|$|In 2011, an Adelaide woman {{contacted}} biological anthropologist Maciej Henneberg {{about an}} identification card of an H. C. Reynolds {{that she had}} found in her father's possessions. The card, a document issued in the United States to foreign seamen during World War I, was given to Henneberg in October 2011 for comparison of the ID photograph {{to that of the}} Somerton man. While Henneberg found anatomical similarities in features such as the nose, lips and eyes, he believed they were not as reliable as the close similarity of the ear. The ear shapes shared by both men were a [...] "very good" [...] match, although Henneberg also found what he called a [...] "unique identifier;" [...] a mole on the cheek that was the same shape and in the same position in both photographs."Together with the similarity of the ear characteristics, this mole, in a forensic case, would allow <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> rare statement positively identifying the Somerton man." ...|$|E

2500|$|Like It Like That is {{an album}} of {{original}} soul music influenced by Sebastian's previous album, The Memphis Album, which was a covers album of Memphis soul songs recorded with members of The MGs including Steve Cropper in Memphis in 2007. Sebastian and Cropper remained friends, and Sebastian made several songwriting trips to Nashville in mid-2008, staying with the Croppers on these trips. Sebastian {{said in an interview}} with The Age in October 2009, [...] "The most comfortable I've ever felt in the studio was during The Memphis Album. And the success of that prompted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> record like this one." [...] Five of the songs on Like It Like That were co-written with the album's producer David Ryan Harris, four were written entirely by Sebastian himself, and three were co-written with other writers. He later said, [...] "I wrote the music on this album based on how I feel when I listen to the Otis Reddings and the Wilson Picketts of the world. I'll put that music on and it always just lifts me and makes me feel great." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sebastian cites {{a number}} of musicians as his musical influences, {{including}} Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder, Chicago, and Boyz II Men. His music has crossed many genres, including pop, R, funk, smokey soul, gospel, jazz, pop rock, Memphis soul covers, '60s soul/pop and electro R. He has also stated an interest in recording dance and Bollywood albums. While Sebastian's first three albums showed elements of soul, it was The Memphis Album which consolidated {{his reputation as a}} soul musician. Reviewers almost unanimously agreed he had captured the spirit and essence of the Memphis soul classics. It was the critical and public reception for The Memphis Album which gave Sebastian the confidence to stay with the soul genre for his fifth album Like It Like That. In an interview with The Age he said he was told early in his career, [...] "If you self-indulge and just do what you're into, you're going to corner your market. Soul music isn't big here." [...] but [...] "the most comfortable I've ever felt in the studio was during The Memphis Album. And the success of that prompted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> record like this one.
