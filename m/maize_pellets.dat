40|$|One {{hundred and}} {{fourteen}} animal feedstuffs and eighty poultry feed mixts. commonly used for animal and poultry nutrition in Karnataka, India, were analyzed for Fusarium contamination. The total counts of fusaria in animal feeds and poultry feed mixts. revealed a {{high incidence of}} F. verticillioides, being isolated from all pos. samples. Most contaminated samples were <b>maize</b> <b>pellets</b> (71. 4 %), cotton seed (66. 6 %), maize powder (60 %) and fine wheat bran (50 %), resp., while no Fusarium species was isolated from Bengal gram husk and wheat flakes. All the Fusarium species were identified by the PCR method using genus specific ITS and group specific FUM 1 primers. Of the 374 Fusarium isolates tested with ITS set of primers, all fusaria scored pos., whereas only 244 (65 %) isolates tested pos. with the FUM 1 set of primers. The specificity of the primers provides the basis for a simple, accurate and precise detection of Fusarium species that represents fumonisin producers, which are a considerable risk for animal, poultry and human health.

40|$|The aim {{of present}} study was to {{determine}} the species incidence of genus Fusarium in animal and poultry feed mixtures and to know the extent of potential risk of feed contamination by Fusarium mycotoxins. One hundred and seven different animal feed samples and (71) poultry-feed mixtures were collected from Karnataka (India) during April 2004 to April 2005. All samples were analyzed for the incidence of Fusarium species on PDA, DCPA and MGA 2. 5 media. A total frequency of the Fusarium species isolated was determined to be 50 % and their counts ranged from 9. 5 x 10 1 to 4. 4 x 10 5 CFU g - 1 of poultry feed and 5. 728 x 10 1 to 2. 088 x 10 5 CFU g - 1 of animal feed sample. Of the total number of Fusarium isolates (330) from animal and poultry feedstuffs, F. verticillioides recorded 89. 09 %, followed by F. pallidoroseum (6. 66 %), F. oxysporum (3. 63 %) and F. solani (0. 6 %). The results of this study showed a high incidence of F. verticillioides in poultry feed mixtures while animal feeds especially cotton seeds, fine wheat bran and <b>maize</b> <b>pellets</b> showed high incidence of F. verticillioides. Bengal gram husk, coarse horse gram powder, groundnut seed cake, sunflower seed cake and wheat flakes showed very low incidence of F. verticillioides. The study not only reveals a high incidence of the potentially toxigenic F. verticillioides, in the local feeds of Karnataka region but also represents the possibility of occurrence of fusarial mycotoxins, especially fumonisins...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Transgenic maize, which {{produces}} the nontoxic B subunit of the Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin (LT-B) in seed, {{has proven to}} be an effective oral immunogen in mice. Currently, there is considerable concern over accidental consumption of transgenic maize expressing LT-B by humans and domestic animals. We have yet to define nonimmunogenic levels of transgenic LT-B when ingested. OBJECTIVES: Our goal in {{this study was to determine}} the highest dose of LT-B orally administered in mice that does not result in a measurable immune response. We defined an immune response as specific serum or mucosal IgG or IgA significantly greater than background after three feedings (0. 0002 – 20 µg) or a priming response induced by the intermittent feeding. METHODS: We fed transgenic <b>maize</b> <b>pellets</b> on days 0, 7, 21, and 49 and collected serum and fecal samples weekly. Serum was analyzed for LT-B–specific IgG and IgA, and feces was analyzed for LT-B–specific IgA. RESULTS: We observed a dose-dependent anti-LT-B antibody response with high specific antibody concentrations in groups fed high doses (0. 2, 2, 20 µg) of LT-B maize. Mice fed 0. 02 µg LT-B demonstrated immune priming in 62. 5 % of the animals. Mice that were fed ≤ 0. 002 µg LT-B showed no increase in specific antibody nor did they demonstrate immune priming, indicating that 0. 002 µg LT-B was the highest nonimmunogenic dose tested. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that LT-B derived from transgenic maize is immunogenic at nanogram levels when orally administered to mice.

40|$|Sixteen {{lactating}} Girgentana goats {{were used}} to evaluate the effect of polymorphism at αs 1 -casein locus on milk fatty acids composition. Animals, homogeneous for milk production, days of lactation and body weight, were divided into two groups: eight homozygous for strong allele (AA group) and eight homozygous for weak allele (FF group). The experimental diet, identical for the two groups, consisted of alfalfa hay (1. 5 kg), whole barley, whole <b>maize,</b> <b>pelleted</b> sunflower and whole faba bean (0. 5 kg each). In spite of identical selected diets, also in terms of fatty acids, milk fatty acid composition resulted different between the two groups. In particular, except for C 8 : 0, short and medium chain fatty acids and odd chain fatty acids resulted in higher percentage in the AA group. Taking in account that the difference reported in our experiment concerns above all de novo synthesized fatty acids, our results seem to confirm the hypothesis that polymorphism at αs 1 -casein locus can influence milk fatty acid composition in goats...|$|R
40|$|The {{transfer}} of ingested α-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA) determines the nutritional quality of milk, but the factors determining this transfer are unclear. The present experiment investigated {{the influence of}} roughage to concentrate proportions {{and the effect of}} concentrate types on milk fat composition. Respectively, six lactating dairy cows were fed one of three isoenergetic (5 · 4 ± 0 · 05 MJ net energy for lactation/kg dry matter; DM) and isonitrogenous (215 ± 3 · 5 g crude protein/kg DM) diets, consisting of ryegrass hay only (33 g fatty acids/kg DM; ALA-rich, no concentrate), maize (straw, whole <b>maize</b> <b>pellets</b> and gluten; 36 g fatty acids/kg DM; LA-rich; 560 g concentrate/kg DM), or barley (straw and grain plus soybean meal; 19 g fatty acids/kg DM; LA-rich; 540 g concentrate/kg DM). The fatty acid composition of feeds and resulting milk fat were determined by gas chromatography. The ALA concentration in milk fat was highest (P< 0 · 001) with the hay-diet, but the proportionate {{transfer of}} ALA from diet to milk was lower (P< 0 · 001) than with the maize- or barley-diets. The LA concentration in milk fat was highest with the maize-diet (P< 0 · 05, compared with hay) but relative transfer rate was lower (P= 0 · 01). The transfer rates of ALA and LA were reciprocal to the intake of individual fatty acids which thus contributed more to milk fat composition than did roughage to concentrate proportions. The amount of trans- 11 18 : 1 in milk fat was lowest with the barley-diet (P< 0 · 001) and depended on the sum of ALA and LA consumed. The milk fat concentration of cis- 9, trans- 11 18 : 2 (rumenic acid) was more effectively promoted by increasing dietary LA (maize) than ALA (hay). Amounts of 18 : 0 secreted in milk were four (maize) to seven (hay) times higher than the amounts ingested. This was suggestive of a partial inhibition of biohydrogenation in the maize-diet, possibly caused by the high dietary LA leve...|$|E

40|$|The {{fermentation}} {{properties of}} the following feeds: pelleted barley (PB), toasted and pelleted barley (TPB), <b>pelleted</b> <b>maize</b> (PM) and toasted and <b>pelleted</b> <b>maize</b> (TPM) were studied using an in vitro gas production (GP) technique. Each feed sample (0. 5 g) was incubated (3 replications), with rumen fluid collected from 3 grazing lactating dairy cows. The kinetics of GP were automatically recorded for 72 h. The amounts of DM disappeared (DMd) and the volatile fatty acid yields (VFA) were measured. On barley, compared to simple pelleting, toasting significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced DMd (87. 5 vs. 86. 2 %), the asymptotic GP (A, 388 vs. 367 ml/g DMd) and slightly increased the time of maximum GP rate (TRmax, 2. 89 vs. 3. 15 h). On maize toasting did not affect DMd and A, but significantly reduced T 1 / 2 (9. 71 vs. 8. 57; P< 0. 05) and TRmax (5. 04 vs. 4. 49, P< 0. 05). Toasting significantly reduced the VFA yields both of barley and maize. These results, in agreement with previous in sacco and in vivo observations, suggest that toasting might {{reduce the amount of}} potential fermentable substrate of barley, whereas it might increase the rate of fermentation of maize...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{processed}} cereal grain supplementation on volatile fatty acid (VFA) production rates of grazing, lactating Holstein-Friesian cows were measured in a 5 x 5 Latin square experiment. The experimental treatments were as follows: control (only grazing, no supplement addition, NS), pelleted barley (PB), <b>pelleted</b> <b>maize</b> (PM), toasted and subsequently pelleted barley (TPB), and toasted and subsequently <b>pelleted</b> <b>maize</b> (TPM) as supplements. An isotope dilution technique using stable isotope of carbon (13 C) as an internal marker was employed for {{the estimation of}} VFA production. At {{the beginning of a}} 3 -hour long allowed grazing time, 100 mg of 99 % enriched 13 C 2 Na-acetate were introduced in the rumen and repeated after grazing with 50 mg isotope, after which the cows were starved for 6 hours until evening milking. During grazing disappearance rate (kdis) and production rate (kprod) of acetate, propionate and butyrate were significantly higher (P≤ 0. 05) in supplemented than in NS cows. Moreover the effec t of barley grain and pelleting treatment was higher than the effect of maize grain and toasting. During starvation significantly higher (P≤ 0. 05) kdis and kprod of VFAs were observed in PM and TPM treatments. Total VFA production for the experimental period (grazing + starvation) were 49. 5, 78. 7, 69. 9, 88. 5, 80. 8 mol/day for NS, PB, TPB, PM and TPM, respectively. The higher VFA productions measured in supplemented animals emphasis the extensive digestion that occurs in the rumen after feeding processed grains. In methodological terms, 13 C 2 Na-acetate labelling appears to be a useful means for examining the VFA acetate production in ruminants...|$|R
40|$|Three rumen-cannulated, {{lactating}} Holstein-Friesian cows grazed in {{a controlled}} experimental pasture and supplemented daily with concentrates were used to measure effects of different heat treatment of cereal grains (pelleted barley, toasted barley, <b>pelleted</b> <b>maize,</b> toasted maize) on in situ degradability of protein and starch and to estimate of the possible rumen synchrony after feeding processed cereal grains {{as a supplement to}} perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne). Pressure toasting treatment increased (P 0. 05) in situ protein degradability of the cereal grains. Undegraded intake protein increased (P> 0. 05) after pressure toasting from 36. 4 to 52. 5 % for barley and from 50. 3 to 58. 2 % for maize, respectively. Undegraded intake starch increased (P> 0. 05) from 14. 9 to 16. 7 % after toasting barley and decreased from 36. 1 to 31. 3 % for toasted maize, respectively. Pressure toasting reduced washable fractions of each cereal grains for both constituents. The fractional rate of degradation of starch increased in maize, but decreased in barley.

40|$|Ruminant {{husbandry}} {{constitutes the}} most important source of anthropogenic methane (CH 4). In addition to enteric (animal-derived) CH 4, excreta are another source of CH 4, especially when stored anaerobically. Increasing the proportion of dietary concentrate is often considered as the primary CH 4 mitigation option. However, {{it is unclear whether}} this is still valid when diets to be compared are energy-balanced. In addition, non-structural carbohydrates and side effects on nitrogen (N) emissions may be important. In this experiment, diet types representing either forage-only or mixed diets were examined for their effects on CH 4 and N emissions from animals and their slurries in 18 lactating cows. Apart from a hay-only diet, treatments included two mixed diets consisting of <b>maize</b> stover, <b>pelleted</b> whole <b>maize</b> plants and gluten or barley straw and grain and soy bean meal. The diets were balanced in crude protein and net energy for lactation. After adaptation, data and samples were collected for 8 days including a 2 -day CH 4 measurement in respiratory chambers. Faeces and urine, combined proportionately according to excretion, were used to determine slurry-derived CH 4 and N emissions. Slurry was stored for 15 weeks at either 14 °C or 27 °C, and temperatures were classified as ‘cool' and ‘warm', respectively. The low-starch hay-only diet had high organic matter and fibre digestibility and proved to be equally effective on the cows' performance as mixed diets. The enteric CH 4 formation remained unaffected by the diet except when related to digested fibre. In this case emission was lowest with the hay-only diet (61 v. 88 to 101 g CH 4 /kg digested NDF). Feeding the hay diet resulted in the highest slurry-CH 4 production after 7 weeks of storage at 14 °C and 27 °C, and after 15 weeks at 14 °C. CH 4 emissions were, in general, about 10 -fold higher at 27 °C compared with 14 °C but only after 15 weeks of storage. Urinary N losses were highest with the barley diet and lowest with the maize diet. There was a trend towards similar differences in N losses from the slurry of these cows (significant at 14 °C). However, contrary to CH 4, slurry-N emissions seemed to be temperature-independent. In conclusion, energetically balanced diets proved to be widely equivalent in their emission potential when combining animal and their slurry, this even at a clearly differing forage : concentrate ratio. The variation in CH 4 emission from slurry stored shortly or at cold temperature for 15 weeks was of low importance as such conditions did not support methanogenesis in slurry anywa...|$|R
