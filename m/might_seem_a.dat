500|$|Many {{commentators}} {{have suggested that}} Sappho's use of Helen as an example in this poem is intended as a rejection of masculine in favour of feminine values. [...] For instance, John J. Winkler argues that the poem sets Sappho's definition of beauty against a masculine ideal of military power. [...] However, G. O. Hutchinson notes that, though the definition of beauty Sappho attacks <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> characteristically male one, the definition she replaces it with is generally applicable, rather than being solely relevant to women.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{multiplayer}} {{was praised}} by reviewers, especially {{in comparison to}} the single-player [...] "Story Mode". The multiplayer element was noted for appealing to a diverse demographic for its party game qualities and being an [...] "'everybody' title". Conversely, [...] "Story mode" [...] was criticised for exacerbating issues relating to pace, which was already remarked as having [...] "snail's pace". Additionally, the Artificial Intelligence involved was bemoaned for contributing an imbalance in the game, with the random availability of quality items giving players an unfair advantage. The [...] "reversal of fortune" [...] space, which initiates a minigame by which the victor would receive another player's stars or coins, was criticised for similar reasons, as it potentially penalises players who do well in the game. The minigames were mainly met with a positive reaction, with critics praising their simplicity. The grouping feature in the minigames were also welcomed for contributing a new dynamic of gameplay, although Bramwell commented that [...] "It <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> little odd to gang up with your competitors in some cases".|$|E
500|$|The {{sequencing}} of the record's track list was done strategically, starting with songs that lyrically depict societal injustices {{and ending with}} those that explore love, relationships and sexuality. This decision also factored into the album's artwork and marketing, giving it an overt black and white militant imagery. Jam explained that [...] "he idea of putting 'Rhythm Nation', 'Living in the World' and 'The Knowledge' as the first three songs on the record really set the tone {{as to what the}} record was. Then to have the segue after that where she says, 'Get the point? Good. Let's dance...' and then go into 'Miss You Much', that was purposely done." [...] He also stated that the safer marketing strategy for the project would have been [...] "a beautiful colored picture of Janet on the cover" [...] with Escapade as its title, starting the track listing with [...] "Miss You Much", [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)" [...] and [...] "Escapade", and ending it with [...] "Livin' in a World (They Didn't Make)", [...] "The Knowledge" [...] and [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] but noted that despite being the same collection of songs, the alternate sequencing and imagery would not have had the same impact. Of its lyrical themes, Kate Kelly stated the album [...] "reveals a social conscience speaking of getting an education, avoiding drugs, and feeding the homeless. All this <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> little heavy for dance music or pop radio, but Jackson fuses her concepts with driving dance energy that hits the hearts of those hitting the dance-floor." [...] Andrew Barker of Variety described it as [...] "a quasi-concept album whose opening three songs directly addressed crime, the crack epidemic, racism, homelessness and youth illiteracy — not exactly a recipe for a party. And yet the record was somehow even more successful than Control, generating a then-record seven top 5 singles." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Brunschvig, {{although}} the total abolition of slavery <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> reprehensible innovation {{and contrary to}} the Qur'an {{and the practice of}} early Muslims, the realities of the modern world caused a [...] "discernible evolution in the thought of many educated Muslims {{before the end of the}} 19th century." [...] These Muslims argued that Islam on the whole has [...] "bestowed an exceptionally favourable lot on the victims of slavery" [...] and that the [...] institution of slavery is linked to the particular economic and social stage in which Islam originated. According to the influential thesis of Ameer Ali, Islam only tolerated slavery through temporary necessity and that its complete abolition was not possible at the time of Muhammad.|$|E

2500|$|David Fricke of Rolling Stone complimented the band's [...] "bright, wired bounce and the shell-game shuffle of funk beats, snappy Jamaican {{rhythms and}} mosh-pit, shout-it-out choruses in Nowell's writing," [...] deeming it [...] "the stuff {{of a band}} with great promise and the {{confidence}} {{to make good on}} it. If only that were still possible." [...] RJ Smith of Spin praised Nowell's songwriting craft, writing, [...] "It <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> daring experiment if it hadn't so effortlessly sprung from a Long Beach surf scene that featured acoustic jams on the beach that naturally flowed from Wailers to Descendents classics [...] Sublime succeeds not just on vibe but on songcraft." [...] Nisid Hajari of Entertainment Weekly called the album a [...] "respectable testament" [...] to Nowell's memory, ultimately noting that the record [...] "coheres more on an intellectual rather than emotional level, its sound too diffuse to be dramatic." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the record an A-, commenting, [...] "Junkies who retain enough soul to create music at all are generally driven to put their brilliance and stupidity in your face. Nowell is altogether more loving, unassuming, good-humored, and down-to-earth — or so he pretends, which when you're good is all it takes." ...|$|E
2500|$|He was succeeded as viceroy by García Sarmiento de Sotomayor, 2nd Count of Salvatierra on November 23, 1642, but {{continued}} to hold the post of visitador. Having a bishop serve as viceroy was not the usual pattern of appointment, but the extraordinary circumstances that prompted to crown to precipitously remove the previous viceroy meant that Palafox was a useful, if temporary, replacement until the crown appointed his successor. [...] The high tension between the new viceroy, Salvatierra, and bishop and visitador general Palafox was not unprecedented however. [...] In 1624 the viceroy the marquis of Gelves had ordered the expulsion of the archbishop from the viceroyalty, in clear terms the civil authority challenging the ecclesiastical. [...] That earlier conflict had resulted in a huge riot in the main plaza of Mexico City and the ouster of the viceroy himself. The conflict between Salvatierra and Palafox, who was then acting as visitador, flared over what <b>might</b> <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> trivial matter, {{whether or not the}} viceroy could sit on a cushion when seated with the Audiencia. [...] Palafox said no, since it distinguished the viceroy from the high court judges. However, the practice had been standard with earlier viceroys. Where the performance of power and its prerogatives was important not as minor traditions but as the theater of power, such a conflict was seated in deeper issues.|$|E
