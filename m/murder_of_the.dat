5|$|The {{novel is}} a {{combination}} of fact and fiction. Blending together these two elements is important in any historical novel, but especially in The Feast of the Goat because Vargas Llosa chose to narrate an actual event through the minds of both real and fictional characters. Some characters are fictional, and those that are non-fictional still have fictionalized aspects in the book. The general details of the assassination are true, and the assassins are all real people. While they lie in wait for the Dictator to arrive, they recount actual crimes of the regime, such as the <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mirabal sisters. However, other details are invented by Vargas Llosa, such as Amadito's <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brother of the woman he loved.|$|E

5|$|After {{the initial}} {{success of the}} Shakespeare Gallery, many wanted to take credit. Henry Fuseli long claimed that his planned Shakespeare ceiling (in {{imitation}} of the Sistine Chapel ceiling) had given Boydell {{the idea for the}} gallery. James Northcote claimed that his Death of Wat Tyler and <b>Murder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Princes in the Tower had motivated Boydell to start the project. However, according to Winifred Friedman, who has researched the Boydell Gallery, it was probably Joshua Reynolds's Royal Academy lectures on the superiority of history painting that influenced Boydell the most.|$|E

Guiteau might have had neurosyphilis, a disease that causes physiological mental impairment. He was executed on June 30, 1882.|$|E
5|$|Halotus (c. 20–30 ADc. 70–80 AD) was {{a servant}} to the Roman Emperor Claudius, the fourth {{member of the}} Julio-Claudian dynasty. He served Claudius as a taster and as a chief steward; {{it was because of}} his occupation, which entailed close contact with Claudius, that he is and was a suspect in the <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter by poison. Along with Agrippina the Younger, the wife of Claudius, Halotus was {{considered}} one of the most likely to have committed the murder, although speculation by ancient historians suggest that he may have been working under orders of Agrippina.|$|E

5|$|In 1320, {{following}} the death of Michael IX Palaiologos (eldest son of Andronikos II and co-emperor from 1295 on), his son Andronikos III was crowned as co-emperor by Andronikos II. Although initially popular with his grandfather, the younger Andronikos and his entourage of young nobles, to which Syrgiannes belonged, had by that time caused the elder emperor's displeasure by their extravagance. Their excesses culminated in the mistaken-identity <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young emperor's younger brother, Manuel; enraged, the elder Andronikos annulled his grandson's titles, and a deep personal rift was opened between the two.|$|E

During Mary's and Darnley's difficult marriage, Darnley secretly allied himself with the rebels and conspired in the <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen's private secretary, David Rizzio, just three months before James's birth.|$|E

The {{surviving}} population (estimated at 2,897 to 5,600) was then killed en masse in the gas chambers.

5|$|Rumours {{began to}} {{circulate}} among the Hopleys' servants, suggesting that Hopley's wife {{had spent the}} night prior to the body's discovery cleaning up evidence of her husband's <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boy. Reginald's older brother, Reverend John Henry Cancellor, Jr. (1834–1900), arrived in Eastbourne from Send, Surrey, on 25April. He noticed discrepancies in the reports of his brother's death and requested an autopsy. Hopley asked prominent physician Sir Charles Locock, an acquaintance of the Cancellor family and an obstetrician to the Queen, to examine the body and verify death by natural causes; Locock believed that Hopley was responsible for the death.|$|E

The protracted negotiations resulted in the payment of the arrears of Byzantine tribute, the promise that Constantine VII would marry one of Simeon's daughters, and, most importantly, Simeon's official recognition as Emperor of the Bulgarians by Patriarch Nicholas in the Blachernae Palace.|$|E
