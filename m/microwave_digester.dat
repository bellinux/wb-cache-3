40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} is {{a well-known}} technique for the recovery of energy from waste activated sludge. To increase the biodegradability of the sludge and to enhance the digestion efficiency, pretreatment methods are of great importance. In this study, ultrasound and microwave pre-treatment were compared, {{through the use of}} three pilot scale semi-continuous digesters with a solids retention time of 20 days. During the experiment, one reactor was fed with untreated sludge (blank), one with ultrasound pre-treated sludge and one with microwave pre-treated sludge (both treated with a specific energy of 2100 kJ/kg sludge). (Organic) dry matter, COD, carbohydrates and proteins were analysed during digestion. The solubilisation of the organic material was the most effective by the ultrasound pre-treatment. The biogas production, which {{is the result of a}} change in sludge composition, is the highest in the <b>microwave</b> pre-treated <b>digester.</b> This results in an increased biogas production of 27 % (i. e. 0. 105 L/g ODS, blank 0. 085 L/g ODS), compared to a 23 % (i. e. 0. 108 L/g ODS) increase by the ultrasound pre-treated digester.

40|$|Background. In {{spite of}} the {{availability}} of substitutes for lead and cadmium compounds in paints, manufacturers continue to produce paints with high levels of these metals. As the population continues to grow and there is a continued shift from oil-based to water-based paints, the sales and use of these paints will increase the exposure of humans and the environment to these metals. Objectives. We measured the levels of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) in 174 paint samples marketed in Lagos and Ibadan, Nigeria. Paint samples from different manufacturers registered with and without Standards Organization of Nigeria (SON) were considered. Methods. Samples were acid digested using a <b>microwave</b> <b>digester</b> and the levels of the elements were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Discussion. The levels of Cd and Pb (dry weight) in all samples ranged from 98 – 1999 μg/g and 170 – 3231 μg/g, respectively. All the samples were above the permissible limits of 90 ppm of the US Consumer Product Safety Commission and 100 ppm limit of the European Union (EU) for Pb and Cd in paint. Conclusions. We concluded that water-based paints marketed in Nigeria still contain substantial amounts of lead and cadmium which are detrimental to human health and the entire ecosystem. These metals are among the EU priority metals due to the increased risk of occupational exposure to humans and vulnerable groups such as children. Competing Interests.

40|$|Abstract Background Geophagy or earth-eating {{is common}} amongst some Bangladeshi women, {{especially}} those who are pregnant, both in Bangladesh and in the United Kingdom. A {{large proportion of the}} population in Bangladesh is already exposed to high concentrations of arsenic (As) and other toxic elements from drinking contaminated groundwater. Additional exposure to As and other toxic elements from non-food sources has not been adequately addressed and here we present the first study to monitor As levels in baked clay (known as sikor). Methods Sikor samples originating from Bangladesh were digested using a <b>microwave</b> <b>digester</b> and analysed for their As, Pb, Cd, Mn, Fe and Zn levels using ICP-MS. Detailed As speciation analysis was performed using HPLC-ICP-MS. Results Of particular concern were the levels of As (3. 8 - 13. 1 mg kg - 1), Cd (0. 09 - 0. 4 mg kg - 1) and Pb (21 - 26. 7 mg kg - 1) present in the sikor samples and their possible impact on human health. Speciation analysis revealed that sikor samples contained mainly inorganic As. Modest consumption of 50 g of sikor is equivalent to ingesting 370 μg of As and 1235 μg of Pb per day, based on median concentration values. This level of sikor consumption exceeds the permitted maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI) of inorganic As by almost 2 -fold. Conclusion We conclude that sikor can be a significant source of As, Cd and Pb exposure for the Bangladeshi population consuming large quantities of this material. Of particular concern in this regard is geophagy practiced by pregnant women concurrently exposed to As contaminated drinking water. Future studies needs to evaluate the bioavailability of As and other elements from sikor and their impact on human health. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Lebanese {{coast is}} {{subjected}} to a strong urban, touristic and industrial pressure. The wastewater of the littoral zone eventually reaches the sea without undergoing, in general, any pretreatment. This precarious situation escalates with the absence of laws that address the "food security" and “environmental” aspects throughout the Lebanese coast or the non-applicationof the existing ones. The fisheries sector inparticular, suffered the consequences. Indeed, in Lebanon, the consumer’s interest for fish is growing. For them the sea products in particularly fish are considered as a healthy food, or even as a luxury food. The sea food restaurants lining the coast {{are among the most}} expensive and the most prestigious in the country. But consumer confidence has been eroded by media reports evoking the maritime pollution in the country. It is in this context that we chose to study the metal pollution of two species of fish (Diplodus sargus and Siganus rivulatus) in a region particularly affected by pollution which run from Tabarja to the north of Beirut and end at Ouzaï located at the south of the capital. The captured fishes was completely grounded, lyophilized and mineralized. The mineralization was conducted in a <b>microwave</b> <b>digester.</b> After that, the six trace elements were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy: Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn. The obtained results are in general, consistent within international studies : the fish accumulation for the metal contaminants (with exception of Hg) is low. The recorded values are less or equal than the maximum limits in food set by international bodies. Considering the season factor, we note a seasonal fluctuation in the concentration of the studied metals. By comparing the metal level for the three sites, we note that the Ouzaï site is in general, the most polluted one...|$|E

Objectives of work presented here include establishing the toxicity of a variety of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to Daphnia magna neonates, assessing the applicability of a commonly used bioassay for testing AgNPs, and determining the advantages and disadvantages of multiple characterization techniques for AgNPs in simple aquatic systems. Daphnia magna were exposed to a silver nitrate solution and AgNPs suspensions including commercially available AgNPs (uncoated and coated), and laboratory-synthesized AgNPs (coated with coffee or citrate). The nanoparticle suspensions were analyzed for silver concentration (microwave acid digestions), size (dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy), shape (electron microscopy), surface charge (zeta potentiometer), and chemical speciation (X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction). Toxicities of filtered (100 nm) versus unfiltered suspensions were compared. Additionally, effects from addition of food were examined. Stock suspensions were prepared by adding AgNPs to moderately hard reconstituted water, which were then diluted and used straight or after filtration with 100 -nm filters.

40|$|The {{north of}} Africa is {{currently}} experiencing {{a great deal}} of economic development, which often, as confirmed by many examples, brings about the risk of pollution by toxic chemicals. The Nador Lagoon, the subject of several environmental studies, is located on the northern coast of Morocco. This lagoon is a great point of interest for the natural environment and for the increasing anthropogenic pressure due to adjacent businesses. This work aims to obtain further information about the status of contamination of this lagoon through analysis of sediment cores taken in June 2009. Chemical analyses were carried out of persistent organic compounds (POPs), in particular Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), as well as the elements of interest for the determination of inorganic contamination. This study addressed four sediment cores taken {{in some of the most}} interesting places of the lagoon. For measuring the lagoon sediment chronology the radionuclides 210 Pb and 137 Cs have been used. These also show the possible perturbation of sediments during the years. The sediment dating allowed us to choose the best cores for organic and inorganic chemical analysis. The organic contamination was detected mostly in one sediment core, taking into account the most important samples along the core; for the other three cores only the upper sediment samples have been analyzed. The inorganic contamination was detected in two complete cores. The experimental part concerning the organic compounds involved automatic systems for extraction and purification; the determination was carried out by HRGC-LRMS. The elemental analysis was carried out using analytical protocols already developed in the laboratory: digestion with acids by means of a <b>microwave</b> <b>digester,</b> sample dilution, and then ICP-MS has been used for the analysis. In addition, we used multivariate statistical approaches to develop the results of the analyses and obtain more information about the samples correlation and the origin of the pollution.
