After a stop over night and an exploration of the miniature-grand volcanic scene, we pulled on across the canyon and took the grade where the cicadas simmered audibly in the noon sunshine among the hillside manzanitas. Then, higher, came the big cattle-dotted upland pastures, and the rocky summit. And here on the summit, abruptly, we caught a vision, or what seemed a mirage. The ocean we had left long days before, yet far down and away shimmered a blue sea, framed on the farther shore by rugged mountains, on the near shore by fat and rolling farm lands.

2500|$|In January 1945 the Soviets began {{a series}} of offensives in its drive to Berlin. The Lower Silesian Offensive and Upper Silesian Offensives and the vital Vistula-Oder Offensive was {{designed}} to bring the Red Army to the eastern border of Germany. The Soviets began their offensive early, to take the pressure off the Western Allies in the Ardennes. For the Fw 190s units, the initial stages were to prove tactically successful. The Soviets were forced to start offensive action under severe weather conditions. Airfields were reduced to <b>mud-baths</b> owing to heavy rains, and open country became impassable owing after use by large numbers of vehicles. The Red Air Force suffered more losses to accidents than combat. The Soviet armour was forced to use the few hard-surface roads to continue their advance. These routes were easily detected by German Schlachtgeschwader. The Germans, by contrast, had hard surface runways in German territory and large hangars for aircraft. On 26 January 800 vehicles, 14 tanks and 40 artillery pieces were claimed among the crammed highways. After two weeks, the offensive slowed. Fw 190 units in particular exacted a heavy toll of Soviet infantry; attacking in waves of seven to nine, unchallenged. Overall, the Germans claimed 2,000 vehicles and 51 tanks in the first three days of February. However, this came at a cost of 107 aircraft in nearly 3,000 attacks. The largest concentration of German air forces since 1940 was amassed against the Soviets, which saw the Germans gain air supremacy briefly, contributing to saving Berlin from capture sooner. The rapid construction of concrete runways allowed the Soviets to win back [...] "aerial superiority". On 14 or 16 February 1945 [...] Otto Kittel became the most successful Luftwaffe ace to be killed in action; Kittel had achieved 267 victories on the Eastern Front, all but 39 in the Fw 190.|$|R

But now at this early age, he quits the paternal roof; goes forth into looser, louder, more exciting society; and becomes initiated in those dissipations, those vices, which a certain class of philosophers have asserted to be a natural preparative for entering on active life; a kind of <b>mud-bath,</b> in which the youth is, as it were, necessitated to steep, and, we suppose, cleanse himself, before the real toga of Manhood can be laid on him. We shall not dispute much with this class of philosophers; we hope they are mistaken; for Sin and Remorse so easily beset us at all stages of life, and are always such indifferent company, that it seems hard we should, at any stage, be forced and fated not only to meet, but to yield to them; and even serve for a term in their leprous armada. We hope it is not so. Clear we are, at all events, it cannot be the training one receives in this service, but only our determining to desert from it, that fits for true manly Action. We become men, not after we have been dissipated, and disappointed in the chase of false pleasure; but after we have ascertained, in any way, what impassable barriers hem us in through this life; how mad it is to hope for contentment to our infinite soul from the gifts of this extremely finite world! that a man must be sufficient for himself; and that [...] "for suffering and enduring there is no remedy but striving and doing." [...] Manhood begins when we have in any way made truce with Necessity; begins, at all events, when we have surrendered to Necessity, as the most part only do; but begins joyfully and hopefully only when we have reconciled ourselves to Necessity; and thus, in reality, triumphed over it, and felt that in Necessity we are free. Surely, such lessons as this last, which, in one shape or other, is the grand lesson for every mortal man, are better learned from the lips of a devout mother, in the looks and actions of a devout father, while the heart is yet soft and pliant, than in collision with the sharp adamant of Fate, attracting us to shipwreck us, when the heart is grown hard, and may be broken before it will become contrite!

5000|$|Days after {{returning}} to England, as the First Division's joint top-scorer (level on 28 goals with Southampton's Ron Davies) Best was presented with the FWA Footballer of the Year award, becoming the youngest ever recipient of the award. Facing United in the European Cup Final at Wembley were Benfica; whilst his teammates rested, Best found [...] "a novel way to relax" [...] before the big game by sleeping with [...] "a particular young lady called Sue". The game went into extra-time, and just three minutes into extra-time Best went on a mazy run and beat goalkeeper José Henrique with a dummy, before rolling {{the ball into the}} net; two further goals from Brian Kidd and Bobby Charlton settled the tie at 4-1. The victory was not only the pinnacle of Best's career, but arguably Manchester United's greatest achievement, considering the Munich air disaster had wiped out most of the Busby Babes just ten years previously. Best also won the Ballon d'Or in 1968 after receiving more votes than Bobby Charlton, Dragan Džajić and Franz Beckenbauer. This meant that he had won the three major honours in club football at the age of just 22 (the league title, European Cup, and European Player of the Year award). After this, his steady decline began. [...] "It seems impossible to hurt him. All manner of men have tried to intimidate him. Best merely glides along, riding tackles and brushing giants aside like leaves." [...] — Joe Mercer, Manchester City manager, 1969. The 'holy trinity' of Best, Law and Charlton remained effective as ever in the 1968-69 campaign. However the club's new recruits were not up to scratch, as United dropped to 11th in the league before Busby announced his retirement. Best later said that [...] "I increasingly had the feeling that I was carrying the team at times on the pitch." [...] He scored 22 goals in 55 games, though only he and Denis Law scored more than six league goals. In the Intercontinental Cup, fans and players alike looked forward to seeing United take on Argentine opposition Estudiantes de La Plata over the course of two legs. However Best said [...] "no one tackled harder or dirtier than this Argentinian team" [...] as a 1-0 defeat at the Estadio Camilo Cichero was followed by a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford. In the home tie, Best was kicked and spat on by José Hugo Medina, and both players were sent off after Best reacted with a punch. Despite their poor league form, United managed to reach the semi-finals of the European Cup (they had a relatively easy run in getting past the Republic of Ireland's Waterford United, Belgium's Anderlecht, and Austria's Rapid Wien) where they were knocked out 2-1 on aggregate by A.C. Milan following a 2-0 defeat at the San Siro; Milan goalkeeper Fabio Cudicini was the hero after keeping United to only one goal at Old Trafford. [...] "It's been a joke on the circuit ever since. You know, I'm {{on one side of the}} street, George Best is on the other. He nods to me and I dive under a bus." [...] — Northampton goalkeeper Kim Book laughs about the jibes he has faced since being fooled by Best's feint in the 1970 FA Cup game against Manchester United. United improved slightly under new boss Wilf McGuinness, but still only managed an eighth-place finish in the 1969-70 season.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} effects of both {{balneotherapy}} and <b>mud-bath</b> therapy treatments in patients affected by primary fibromyalgia (FM) using rheumatological, psychiatric, biochemical and proteomic approaches. METHODS: Forty-one FM patients (39 females, 2 males), who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria received a 2 -week thermal therapy programme consisting of therapy once daily for 6 days/week. Twenty-one patients received <b>mud-bath</b> treatment, while the other twenty balneotherapy. Pain, symptoms, and quality of life were assessed. Oxytocin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ATP and serotonin transporter levels during therapy were assayed. Comparative whole saliva (WS) proteomic analysis was performed using a combination of two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 DE) and mass spectrometry techniques. RESULTS: We observed a reduction in pain, FIQ values and improvement of SF 36 in both groups of patients treated with <b>mud-bath</b> or balneotherapy. The improvement of the outcome measures occurred with different timing and duration in the two spa treatments. A significant decrease in BDNF concentrations was observed either after balneotherapy or <b>mud-bath</b> therapy when assayed after twelve weeks, while no significant change in oxytocin levels, ATP levels and serotonin transporter were detected. Significant differences were observed for phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM 1) and zinc alpha- 2 -glycoprotein 1 (AZGP 1) protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the thermal treatment might have a beneficial effect on the specific symptoms of the disease.

40|$|Background: Balneotherapy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used non-pharmacological approaches for osteoarthritis (OA). Recent data indicate that some biomarkers could be useful to predict OA progression and to assess therapeutic response. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of <b>mud-bath</b> therapy on serum biomarkers in patients with knee OA. Methods: The study group comprised 103 patients with primary symptomatic bilateral knee OA who were randomly assigned to receive a cycle of <b>mud-bath</b> therapy over a period of 2 weeks or to continue their standard therapy alone. Clinical and biochemical parameters were assessed at baseline and after 2 weeks. Clinical assessments included global pain score on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index (WOMAC) subscores for knee OA. Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), C-terminal crosslinked telopeptide type II collagen (CTX-II), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) serum levels were assessed by ELISA. Results: At the end of <b>mud-bath</b> therapy we observed a statistically significant improvement in VAS and WOMAC subscores. Serum levels of COMP, MPO and hsCRP did not show any significant modification in either group, while a significant increase (P < 0. 001) in CTX-II serum levels was observed in the <b>mud-bath</b> group after the treatment. Conclusions: A cycle of <b>mud-bath</b> therapy added to the usual treatment had a beneficial effect on pain and function in patients with knee OA.

Ten days after FCA injection, the rats were randomized in 3 groups of 10 each: {{the first one was}} submitted to a cycle of <b>mud-bath</b> applications, the second one was treated with indomethacin, the third one received only saline per os (control group). The paw volume, measured by plethysmometry, and the serum levels of TNFalpha and IL- 1 beta were considered as evaluation parameters. RESULTS: FCA injection caused a progressive enhancement of paw volume and a rapid increase of TNFalpha and IL- 1 beta serum levels. After the randomization, <b>mud-bath</b> applications reduced inflammation {{and at the end of}} the treatment the paw volume and the TNFa and IL- 1 beta serum levels were significantly tapered in comparison to the controls (p < 0. 01).

40|$|Fibromyalgia (FM) is {{a chronic}} non-inflammatory {{musculoskeletal}} disorder {{characterized by a}} variety of symptoms related to pain. A wide range of other unspecific symptoms may characterize the disease including fatigue, sleep disturbances, mood disorders, morning stiffness, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction (e. g., memory problems, concentration difficulties, diminished mental clarity), irritable bowel and bladder syndrome, sexual dysfunction and sicca symptoms. In the last decade, many attempts have been carried out for the research of specific biomarkers in FM, but, at present, there are no specific markers, the diagnosis is basically clinical. The complexity of the disease means that there isn’t a therapeutic treatment standards and this is demonstrated by the fact that pharmacological treatments are often applied in combination with non-pharmacological treatments. Among non-pharmacological interventions the most used there is the spa therapy, which includes hydrotherapy, balneotherapy, physiotherapy, mud-pack therapy and exercise. In the present work, to study the effects of both balneotherapy and <b>mud-bath</b> therapy treatments in patients affected by FM, we used rheumatological, psychiatric, biochemical and proteomic approach. Forty-one FM patients (39 F, 2 M), who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria received 2 -week thermal therapy program comprising therapy once daily for 6 days/week. Twenty-one patients received <b>mud-bath</b> treatment, while the other twenty balneotherapy. Pain, symptoms, and quality of life were assessed.

This study was conducted to assess the efficacy of <b>mud-bath</b> therapy with mineral water from the Sillene Spring at Italy's Chianciano Spa in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. Patients (n = 61) were divided into two groups. Group A underwent three cycles of mud-based spa therapy over a year's time, whereas group B did not. Clinical conditions, visual analogue scale pain ratings, and Lequesne indexes of the two groups were compared. We also compared these same parameters in the patients of the two groups that were following the therapy with drugs and in the patients of the group A before and after spa treatment. The percentage of patients with no symptoms or mild symptoms was higher in group A than in group B. Within group A, this percentage was higher after treatment than before spa therapy. Even in the comparison between the patients of the two groups that were following the therapy with drug, the results was that in group A the percentage of patients with no symptoms or mild symptoms was higher than in group B. Statistical analyses based on various tests revealed that almost all these differences were highly significant. No adverse effects were observed in any of the patients in group A.

Groups: intact (int) on chippings; (con) arthritis on chippings; (san 38) arthritis on hot sand; (mu 38) arthritis on hot mud; (mu 21) arthritis on mild mud. Bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm 2) {{was measured by}} dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and femurs were tested biomechanically. Bone markers osteocalcin (OC), PINP and CTX were analysed in bone. Results: BMD of right femur decreased vs. left in san 38 (p = 0. 030) and mu 38 (p = 0. 047). Fracture load of right/left femur (N) decreased in experimental groups, significantly in san 38 (p = 0. 05). Fracture threshold of neck decreased in right vs. left in experimental groups, but significantly in san 38 (p = 0. 05). OC decreased in mu 38 vs. con (1. 84 ± 0. 14 / 2. 62 ± 0. 23). PINP decreased in int vs. san 38 (p = 0. 005) and mu 21 (p < 0. 001). CTX decreased in int vs. mu 38 (p = 0. 006) and mu 21 (p = 0. 005). Conclusion: The hot bath appears indifferent in relation to osteoporosis, while cold <b>mud-bath</b> shows good effect on bone metabolism. The cold mud-baths help to reduce arthritic inflammation and pain and thereby lead to higher mobility with positive consequence on bone...|$|E
40|$|Adipocytokines, {{including}} adiponectin, resistin, and visfatin {{may play}} an important role in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis (OA). Spa therapy is one of the most commonly used non-pharmacological approaches for OA, but its mechanisms of action are not completely known. The aim of the present study was to assess whether a cycle of <b>mud-bath</b> therapy (MBT) influences the serum levels of adiponectin, resistin, and visfatin in patients with knee OA. As part of a prospective randomized, single blind-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of MBT in knee OA, we included in this study 95 outpatients. One group (n = 49) received a cycle of MBT at the spa center of Chianciano Terme (Italy) in addition to the usual treatment, and one group (control group; n = 46) continued their regular care routine alone. Patients were assessed at basal time and at the end of the study (15  days) for clinical and biochemical parameters. Clinical assessments included spontaneous pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) score and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities index (WOMAC) subscores for knee OA evaluated as total pain score (W-TPS), total stiffness score (W-TSS), and total physical function score (W-TPFS). Adiponectin, resistin and visfatin serum levels were assessed by enzyme immunoassay methods. At the end of the <b>mud-bath</b> therapy, serum adiponectin levels showed a significant decrease (p < 0. 001), while no significant modifications were found in the control group at day 15. Serum resistin showed a significant decrease (p < 0. 0001) in the MBT group at the end of the study and a significant increase in the control patients (p < 0. 001). No significant modifications of visfatin were found in MBT. Furthermore, we tested the relationships between demographic and clinical parameters and adipocytokine concentrations measured in the MBT group at basal and at the end of the study. In conclusion, the present study shows that a cycle of MBT can modify serum levels of adiponectin and resistin but not the circulating levels of visfatin. In view of the recent evidences about the involvement of adiponectin and resistin in the pathogenesis and progression of OA, the decrease of these adipokines after <b>mud-bath</b> therapy may play a protective role in the course of the disease. However, it remains to be clarified which of the mechanisms of action of MBT may have determined the changes in serum levels of adiponectin and resistin that we observed...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess bone mineral density (BMD) in women on long-term <b>mud-bath</b> therapy (MBT) for osteoarthritis in a Salus per Aquam (SPA) environment. Two hundred and fifty female patients were randomly enrolled in this study in the SPA center of Sardara (Cagliari, Italy) where they were treated with a combination of daily full body mudpacks and bicarbonate-alkaline mineral water baths at cycles of 2 weeks/year. BMD was evaluated by means of calcaneus ultrasonometry (Sahara Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA, USA) and results analyzed according to duration of treatment and clinical variables. In the group of patients undergoing MBT for more than 10 years (group A) and for 3 to 10 years (group B) a reduced frequency of osteopenia and osteoporosis was detected (35. 8 % and 7. 6 % group A; 38. 4 % and 8. 5 % group B, respectively) compared to controls (group C) (48. 9 % and 23. 4 %, P The {{objective of}} this study was to assess bone mineral density (BMD) in women on long-term <b>mud-bath</b> therapy (MBT) for osteoarthritis in a Salus per Aquam (SPA) environment.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Despite the {{efficacy}} of TNF inhibitors, most patients with psoriatic arthritis maintain a residual synovial inflammation. The main aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effects of <b>mud-bath</b> therapy on clinical picture of PsA patients treated with TNF inhibitors. The secondary outcome was to assess synovial inflammation in hand joints detected by contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Other aims were to verify the risk of arthritis flare and to evaluate the effects of spa treatment on functional ability and on quality of life. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with psoriatic arthritis, treated in the last 6 months with TNF inhibitors, were enrolled. After 1 : 1 randomisation, 18 patients (group A) underwent <b>mud-bath</b> therapy (12 mudpacks and 12 thermal baths), maintaining treatment with TNF inhibitors; 18 patients (group B) continued pharmacological therapy alone. CRP, PASI, DAS 28, swollen and tender joint count, VAS pain, HAQ and SF- 36 were evaluated at baseline (T 0) and after 45 days (T 1). Synovial inflammation detected by contrast-enhanced ultrasound, analysed by a software system, was also assessed. RESULTS: A significant improvement in PASI (P< 0. 005), DAS 28 (P< 0. 05), swollen joint count and tender joint count (P< 0. 001), and HAQ (P< 0. 001) between T 0 and T 1 was observed in group A. No patient underwent a flare-up of arthritis. Ultrasound videos demonstrated a significant appearance delay (P< 0. 05) and faster washout (P< 0. 02) of contrast dye in group A patients with respect to group B. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a decrease of residual synovial inflammation and a beneficial clinical effect of spa therapy in psoriatic arthritis patients treated with TNF inhibitors...|$|E
