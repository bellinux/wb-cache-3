5|$|Semantic {{challenges}} to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued {{that to be}} commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, atheists and agnostics could not be moral; he saw this as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the theory on modal grounds by arguing that, even if God's command and morality correlate in this world, they <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> so in other possible worlds. In addition, the Euthyphro dilemma, first proposed by Plato (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject to the whims of God, or challenge his omnipotence. Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral autonomy and religious pluralism, although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{condition}} of the cricket ball is crucial to the amount of movement through the air a bowler can produce, the laws governing what players may and <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> to the ball are specific and rigorously enforced. The umpires will inspect the ball frequently during a match. If the ball is out of shape due to normal wear and tear due to batting and ball hitting the pitch, a ball of similar usage rate and condition will be replaced (ie a ball of about 30-overs old will be replaced by a ball about the same 'age').|$|E
25|$|Under content codes {{issued by}} the Media Development Authority, {{political}} advertising is not permitted on radio or television. Instead the Authority arranges for pre-recorded party political broadcasts {{to be made on}} radio and TV, one on the day after nomination day and the other on the eve of polling day. Only political parties fielding at least six candidates at an election are eligible to make a broadcast; independent candidates <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> so. Party political broadcasts must be delivered by candidates, and each broadcast must consist of a single script {{in each of the four}} official languages of Singapore: Malay, Mandarin, Tamil and English. The duration of the permitted broadcast depends on the number of candidates each party is fielding, and ranges from two and a half minutes for a party fielding six or seven candidates, to 12 minutes for one fielding between 80 and 87 candidates. The number of candidates fielded also determines the order of broadcasts, with the broadcast of the party fielding the smallest number of candidates on first and that of the party fielding the largest number last.|$|E
25|$|At {{times when}} a death {{sentence}} is affirmed on direct review, supplemental methods to attack the judgment, though less familiar than a typical appeal, do remain. These supplemental remedies are considered collateral review, that is, an avenue for upsetting judgments that have become otherwise final. Where the prisoner received his death sentence in a state-level trial, as is usually the case, {{the first step in}} collateral review is state collateral review, which is often called state habeas corpus. (If the case is a federal death penalty case, it proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus.) Although all states have some type of collateral review, the process varies widely from state to state. Generally, the purpose of these collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his sentence on grounds that could not have been raised reasonably at trial or on direct review. Most often, these are claims, such as ineffective assistance of counsel, which requires the court to consider new evidence outside the original trial record, something courts <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> in an ordinary appeal. State collateral review, though an important step in that it helps define the scope of subsequent review through federal habeas corpus, is rarely successful in and of itself. Only around 6 percent of death sentences are overturned on state collateral review.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{research}} suggests that some employees perform OCBs to influence how they are viewed within the organization. While these behaviors are not formally {{part of the job}} description, performing them can influence performance appraisals. Researchers have advanced the view that employees engage in OCBs as a form of [...] "impression management," [...] a term coined by Erving Goffman. Goffman defined impression management as [...] "the way in which the individual ... presents himself and his activity to others, the ways in which he guides and controls the impression they form of him, and the kinds of things he may and <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> while sustaining his performance before them. Some researchers have hypothesized that OCBs are not performed out of good will, positive affect, etc., but instead as a way of being noticed by others, including supervisors.|$|E
2500|$|In engineering, {{the term}} {{convective}} heat transfer {{is used to}} describe the combined effects of conduction and fluid flow. From the thermodynamic point of view, heat flows into a fluid by diffusion to increase its energy, the fluid then transfers (advects) this increased internal energy (not heat) from one location to another, and this is then followed by a second thermal interaction which transfers heat to a second body or system, again by diffusion. This entire process is often regarded as an additional mechanism of heat transfer, although technically, [...] "heat transfer" [...] and thus heating and cooling occurs only on either end of such a conductive flow, but not as a result of flow. Thus, conduction can be said to [...] "transfer" [...] heat only as a net result of the process, but <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> so at every time within the complicated convective process.|$|E
