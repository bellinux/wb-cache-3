Finance and banking industry began to pay great attention to risk management, especially after the events that led to the collapse of this industry since last few decades. Meanwhile, Islamic banking and finance industry requires the expertise along with the rapid development and the global environment continues to move. The risk of Islamic banks appears as in conventional banks minus interest. But unique is that the risks in Islamic banks related to the structure of assets and liabilities that exist in Islamic banks. In the asset side, Islamic banks filled by berbada financial instruments with conventional banks. He did not know the interest despite the instrument that gives a definite advantage. While the liabilitasya side, Islamic banks charged by financial instruments that require customers to share the results with customers considering only invest his wealth in the form of money. Contracts made in mobilizing both sides provide important implications for the risk profile faced by Islamic banks. Islamic Bank will face six types of risk (IFSB - version of Islamic Financial Services Board -), namely : Credit Risk (credit risk), Equity Investment Risk (risk of equity investment), Market Risk (market risk), Liquidity Risk (liquidity risk), rate of Return risk (risk rate of return), operational Risk (operational risk). Meanwhile, according to Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 5 / 8 of 2003 on the Application of Risk Management for Banks, banks will face at least eight types of risk, namely : 1) Credit Risk; 2) Market Risk; 3) Liquidity Risk; 4) Operational Risk; 5) Legal Risk; 6) Reputation Risk; 7) Strategic Risk; and 8) Risk Compliance.

40|$|In {{the recent}} debate on {{political}} legitimacy, {{we have seen}} the emergence of a revisionist camp, advocating the idea of ‘legitimacy without political obligation,’ as opposed to the traditional view that political obligation is necessary for state legitimacy. The revisionist idea of legitimacy is appealing because if it stands, the widespread skepticism about the existence of political obligation will not lead us to conclude that the state is illegitimate. Unfortunately, existing conceptions of ‘legitimacy without political obligation’ are subject to serious objections. In this article, I propose a new conception of ‘legitimacy without political obligation,’ and defend it against various objections that the revisionist idea of legitimacy is either conceptually or morally mistaken.

A general effort is to process a large number of training examples and hence describe the problem accurately. Current approaches are based on the assumption that non-face patterns can be easily obtained contrary to faces. While the faces remain in the training the whole time, the easy non-face patterns are stepwise replaced with more difficult ones. In the case when a large number of faces is at disposal, such conventional techniques are not able to process the whole positive training set effectively. The main contribution of this thesis is the improvement of the Waldboost algorithm [12] by which the positive training patterns are treated in a similar way as non-face patterns, called symmetric bootstrap.

40|$|Even if his {{analysis}} {{is not a}} blind, one-sided lauding of commerce, Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations (WN) is often presented as a book that praises commercial societies. For Smith, commerce increases material prosperity and allows for freer institutions and more moral customs. By focusing {{on the role of}} distance in The Theory of Moral Sentiments (TMS), this article proposes that TMS could also be read as a book praising com-mercial societies because commerce may bring about the environment that best facilitates moral development. Commerce breaks the boundaries of small and closed communities. Commercial societies allow for, and are based on, interactions among strangers. And the continuous exposure to strangers can facilitate the moralizing process. In TMS, Smith tells us that humankind is naturally biased by its self-love. Smith also tells us that each individual naturally desires the approbation of others. A person receives approbation when another individual reacts similarly or feels the same as he or she does. The closer one person is to another, the easier it is to share the same feel-ings and the less effort one has to exert to develop command over his passions.

40|$|We {{construct}} {{a model of}} simultaneous change and persistence in institutions. The model consists of landowning elites and workers, and the key economic decision concerns the form of economic institutions regulating the transaction of labor (e. g., competitive markets versus labor repression). The main idea is that equilibrium economic institutions {{are a result of}} the exercise of de jure and de facto political power. A change in political institutions, for example a move from nondemocracy to democracy, alters the distribution of de jure political power, but the elite can intensify their investments in de facto political power, such as lobbying or the use of paramilitary forces, to partially or fully offset their loss of de jure power. In the baseline model, equilibrium changes in political institutions have no effect on the (stochastic) equilibrium distribution of economic institutions, leading to a particular form of persistence in equilibrium institutions, which we refer to as invariance. When the model is enriched to allow for limits on the exercise of de facto power by the elite in democracy or for costs of changing economic institutions, the equilibrium {{takes the form of a}} Markov regime-switching process with state dependence. Finally, when we allow for the possibility that changing political institutions is <b>more</b> <b>difficul...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{symbolic}} representation of gray value variations is studied, especially {{with respect to}} the gradient of the image function. The goal is to relate the results of this analysis to the structure of the picture, which is determined by the physics of the image generation process. The operators for the detection of gray value transitions are the first derivatives of two-dimensional Gaussians with different widths whose positive and negative parts are separately normalized to plus 1 and minus 1, respectively. Candidates for contour points are the maximal magnitudes of the gray value gradient for different scales {{in the direction of the}} gradient. Based on the output of such a bank of gradient filters, a procedure is proposed in order to select automatically a suitable scale and with that the size of the right convolution kernel. In this way, the application of poorly adapted filters, which make the exact localization of gray value corners or T-, X-, and Y-junctions <b>more</b> <b>difficul</b> t, can be avoided. For images of real scenes, possible gaps at such junctions are discussed, and possibilities for the closure of some of these gaps are demonstrated if the extrema of the magnitude of the grav value gradient are used. Closed chains of contour points define regions whose gray values can be reconstructed approximately from the attributes of contour points. Results of the segmentation are shown for various pictures of real scenes...|$|E
40|$|Background: Amongst the {{techniques}} to assess olfactory functions, discrimination and cued identification are those most prone {{to the influence}} of odour short-term memory (STM). Discrimination task requires participants to detect the odd one out of three presented odourants. As re-smelling is not permitted, an un-intended STM load may generate, even though the task purports to assess discrimination ability. Analogously, cued identification task requires participants to smell an odour, and then select a label from three or four alternatives. As the interval between smelling and reading each label increases this too imposes a STM load, even though the task aims to measure identification ability. New method: We tested whether modifying task design to reduce STM load improve performance on these tests. We examined five age-groups of participants (Adolescents, Young adults, Middle-aged, Elderly, very Elderly), some of whom should be more prone to the effects of STM load than others, on standard and modified tests of discrimination and identification. Results: We found that using a technique to reduce STM load improved performance, especially for the very Elderly and Adolescent groups. Comparison with existing methods: Sources of error are now prevented. Conclusions: Findings indicate that STM load can adversely affect performance in groups vulnerable from memory impairment (i. e., very Elderly) and in those who may still be acquiring memory-based representations of familiar odours (i. e., Adolescents). It may be that adults in general would be even more sensitive to the effects of olfactory STM load reduction, if the odour-related task was <b>more</b> <b>difficul...</b>|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{surprising}} things in algebraic geometry {{is the fact that}} algebraic varieties over the complex numbers benefit from a collection of metric properties which strongly influence their topological and geometric shapes. The existence of a K&quot;ahler metric leads to all sorts of Hodge theoretical restrictions on the homotopy types of algebraic varieties. On the other hand, a sparse collection of examples shows that the remaining liberty is nontrivially large. Paradoxically, with all of this information, the research field remains as wide open as it was many decades ago, because the gap between the known restrictions, and the known examples of what can occur, only seems to grow wider and wider the more closely we look at it. In spite of the differential-geometric nature of the questions and methods, the origins of the situation are very algebraic. We look at subvarieties of projective space over the complex numbers. The main over-arching problem in algebraic geometry is to understand the classification of algebro-geometric objects. The topology of the usual complex-valued points of a variety plays an important role, because the topological type is a locally constant function on any classifying space. Thus the partitioning of the classification problem according to topological type provides a coarse, and more calculable, alternative to the partition by connected components. Furthermore, the topology of a variety strongly influences its geometric properties. A sociological observation is that the quest for understanding the topology of algebraic varieties has led to a rich set of techniques which found applications elsewhere, even in physics. Perhaps a word about the choice of ground field is appropriate. One could also look at the shapes of the real points of real algebraic varieties. However, by Weierstrass approximation, pretty much anything can arise if you let the degree get big enough. Thus the classical question in this case is &quot;which shapes can occur for a given degree? &quot; This is so much <b>more</b> <b>difficul...</b>|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, {{the public sector}} has been {{involved}} in a series of reforms aimed at improving public services’ efficiency and effectiveness; the objective was to provide better services to meet public needs, in a context in which the available resources are even more scarce and insufficient. Small municipalities have greater difficulties in guaranteeing suitable levels of efficiency {{in the use of the}} resources and effectiveness in providing services. To solve this problem different policies with the objective to provide services in a shared way have been designed and implemented. The cooperation between municipalities becomes an effective strategy in searching for a greater efficiency of the administrative activity. The research studies the case of the Unions of municipalities in Italy. The Italian legislation in the last few years obliged municipalities with a population less than 5. 000 inhabitants to provide services jointly and the Union of Municipalities are one of the main ways to deliver shared services. However, they did not achieve the desired objectives and are still lagging behind. This research aims at understanding how the Unions of Municipalities actually work, what are the main problems and what are the possibilities for their future development. The research has been carried out through a qualitative and quantitative methodology. In the first phase a normative and documental analysis and two focus group, that have involved politicians and technicians of Sardinian Unions of municipalities, have been done. The analysis of the results of the first phase allowed to individualize the relevant variables that have been analyzed in the second phase through a structured questionnaire administered to the Presidents, the Secretaries and the General Managers of all the Unions of municipalities in Italy. The results of the descriptive analyses show what are the motivations that lead to the choice to set up a Union, what problems and benefits have been found and what are the principal causes of resistance. Moreover, the correlations between different variable have been analyzed. The research tried to investigate whether the variables studied influence shared services management. The main problem seems to be the difficulty of the politicians in giving up the control of the resources and their autonomy. Moreover, the law is not clear and it is continuously changing; it makes the providing of shared services even <b>more</b> <b>difficul...</b>|$|E
