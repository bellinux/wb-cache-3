5|$|A {{supporter}} of the Franco-Polish Military Alliance and the Polish-Romanian Alliance (part of the Little Entente), Piłsudski was disappointed by the French and British policy of appeasement evident in those countries' signing of the Locarno Treaties. Piłsudski therefore aimed also to <b>maintain</b> <b>good</b> relations with the Soviet Union and Germany; hence Poland signed non-aggression pacts with both its powerful neighbors: the 1932 Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. The two treaties were meant to strengthen Poland's position {{in the eyes of}} its allies and neighbors.|$|E
5|$|As he {{prepared}} {{to run for president}} in 2000, Vice President Al Gore attempted to <b>maintain</b> <b>good</b> relations with the Jackson family, hoping to discourage Jackson's father from running for president against him.

In 1998, Gore campaigned for and advised Jackson, and {{went out of his way}} to instruct aides to create a vice presidential event in Jackson's district to boost Jackson.|$|E

Both Foraker and Hanna supported Harding for state Senate in 1899; he gained the Republican nomination and was easily elected to a two-year term.|$|E
5|$|Horses require routine {{hoof care}} from a farrier, {{as well as}} vaccinations to protect against various diseases, and dental {{examinations}} from a veterinarian or a specialized equine dentist. If horses are kept inside in a barn, they require regular daily exercise for their physical health and mental well-being. When turned outside, they require well-maintained, sturdy fences to be safely contained. Regular grooming {{is also helpful to}} help the horse <b>maintain</b> <b>good</b> health of the hair coat and underlying skin.|$|E
5|$|Politically, Belgian {{politics}} {{had been}} dominated {{in the interwar period}} by the Catholic Party, usually in coalition with the Belgian Labour Party (POB-BWP) or the Liberal Party. The 1930s {{also saw the}} rise in popularity of Fascist parties within Belgium; most notably Rex which peaked at the 1936 election with 11% of the vote. From the early 1930s, Belgian foreign and domestic policy had been dominated by the policy of neutrality; leaving international treaties and alliances and attempting to <b>maintain</b> <b>good</b> diplomatic relations with both Britain, France and Germany.|$|E

5|$|Since the Confederacy was founded, {{among other}} things, on states' rights, one {{important}} factor in Davis's choice of cabinet members was representation from the various states. He depended partly upon recommendations from congressmen and other prominent people. This helped <b>maintain</b> <b>good</b> relations between the executive and legislative branches. This also led to complaints as more states joined the Confederacy, however, because there were more states than cabinet positions.|$|E

5|$|With {{the failure}} of the Marburg Colloquy and the split of the Confederation, Zwingli set his goal on an {{alliance}} with Philip of Hesse. He kept up a lively correspondence with Philip. Bern refused to participate, but after a long process, Zurich, Basel, and Strasbourg signed a mutual defence treaty with Philip in November 1530. Zwingli also personally negotiated with France's diplomatic representative, but the two sides were too far apart. France wanted to <b>maintain</b> <b>good</b> relations with the Five States.

5|$|A bicycle kick's {{successful}} performance generally requires great {{skill and}} athleticism. The performer needs to <b>maintain</b> <b>good</b> form when executing the move, and must simultaneously exhibit exceptional {{accuracy and precision}} when striking the ball. Sports historian Richard Witzig recommends that footballers attempt executing a bicycle kick with a focused and determined state of mind. Due to the action's complexity, a successfully executed bicycle kick is notable and, according to sports journalist Elliott Turner, prone to awe audiences. Brazilian forward Pelé, one of the sport's renowned players, also considers the manoeuvre difficult and recalled having scored from it {{only a few times}} out of his 1,283 career goals.|$|E
5|$|After Arghun's death, he was {{followed}} {{in rapid succession}} by two brief and fairly ineffective leaders, one of whom only held power for a few months. Stability was restored when Arghun's son Ghazan took power in 1295, though to secure cooperation from other influential Mongols, he made a public conversion to Islam {{when he took the}} throne, marking a major turning point in the state religion of the Ilkhanate. Despite being an official Muslim, however, Ghazan remained tolerant of multiple religions, and worked to <b>maintain</b> <b>good</b> relations with his Christian vassal states such as Cilician Armenia and Georgia.|$|E

The letter reminded Serbia of its commitment to respect the Great Powers' decision regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina, and to <b>maintain</b> <b>good</b> neighborly relations with Austria-Hungary. The letter contained specific demands aimed at preventing the publication of propaganda advocating the violent destruction of Austria-Hungary, removing the people behind this propaganda from the Serbian Military, arresting the people on Serbian soil {{who were involved in the}} assassination plot and preventing the clandestine shipment of arms and explosives from Serbia to Austria-Hungary.|$|E

5|$|Throughout 1849 and 1850, they contended with Narciso López, the Venezuelan radical who led {{repeated}} filibustering expeditions in {{an attempt}} to conquer the island of Cuba. The annexation of Cuba was the object of fascination among many in the South, who saw in Cuba a potential new slave state, and López had several prominent Southern supporters. López made generous offers to American military leaders to support him, but Taylor and Clayton saw the enterprise as illegal. They issued a blockade, and later, authorized a mass arrest of López and his fellows, although the group would eventually be acquitted. They also confronted Spain, which had arrested several Americans on the charge of piracy, but the Spaniards eventually surrendered them to <b>maintain</b> <b>good</b> relations with the U.S.|$|E
5|$|In {{training}} his men, al-Qassam {{stressed that}} maintaining good character was of paramount importance. As such, fighters should {{provide for the}} needy, aid people with illness, <b>maintain</b> <b>good</b> ties {{with their families and}} pray regularly to God. These virtues, he claimed, were prerequisites to being disciplined and fearless fighters. The moral component of al-Qassam's teachings were especially geared towards the young men of Haifa's labor slums who lived away from their families and who were exposed to activities considered immoral in Islam. He viewed marriage as key to preventing the moral corruption of young men and managed to financially aid his more destitute supporters with their wedding expenses. He encouraged his men to grow beards as a sign of their commitment to jihad and to carry a Qur'an with them wherever they went. Although many of his followers had been illiterate, he taught them how to read and write using the Qur'an as their basis for learning. Al-Qassam also asked his fighters to engage in the spiritual exercises practiced by the Qadiriyya Sufi order and to recite Sufi chants before battle.|$|E
5|$|Swaminarayan strived to <b>maintain</b> <b>good</b> {{relationships}} {{with people of}} other religions, sometimes meeting prominent leaders. His followers cut across religious boundaries, including people of Muslim and Parsi backgrounds. Swaminarayan's personal attendants included Khoja Muslims. In Kathiawad, many Muslims wore kanthi necklaces given by Swaminarayan. He also {{had a meeting with}} Reginald Heber, Lord Bishop of Calcutta and a leader of Christians in India at the time. Bishop Heber mentions in his account of the meeting that about two hundred disciples of Swaminarayan accompanied him as his bodyguards mounted on horses and carrying Matchlocks and swords. Bishop Heber himself had about a hundred horse guards accompanying him (fifty horses and fifty muskets) and mentioned that it was humiliating for him to see two religious leaders meeting at the head of two small armies, his being the smaller contingent. As a result of the meeting, both leaders gained mutual respect for one another.|$|E

5|$|The Seditionista raid on Ojo de Agua had a vast {{impact on}} American {{military}} {{strategy in the}} area. The severity of the raid led the commanding American general in the region, General Frederick Funston, to reinforce the Texas–Mexico border region with troops and to contact Washington with demands that he be allowed to give no quarter to any Mexican raiders who attacked the United States in the future. Although Washington denied General Funston his request, the raids did {{come to an end}} when Washington finally gave diplomatic recognition to the Mexican government under Carranza. Wishing to <b>maintain</b> <b>good</b> relations with the American government, Carranza ordered the Seditionista commanders to cease their raiding activities. Without support from the Mexican federal government the Plan of San Diego movement fell apart and there were no further Mexican invasions of the United States until the Villistas raids began in 1916.|$|E
5|$|Initially other {{villages in}} the area, chiefly Mattau, Soulang and Bakloan, also professed their desire {{to live in peace}} with the Dutch. The villages saw that it was in their {{interest}} to <b>maintain</b> <b>good</b> relations with the newcomers, but this belief was weakened by a series of incidents between 1625 and 1629. The earliest of these was a Dutch attack on Chinese pirates in the bay of Wancan, not far from Mattau, in 1625. The pirates were able to drive off the Dutch soldiers, causing the Dutch to lose face among the Formosan villages. Encouraged by this Dutch failure, warriors from Mattau raided Sinkan, believing the Dutch too weak to defend their Formosan friends. At this point, the Dutch returned to Wancan and this time were able to rout the pirates, restoring their reputation. Mattau was then forced by the colonials to return the property stolen from Sinkan and make reparations in the form of two pigs. The peace was short-lived, however, because in November 1626 the villagers of Sinkan attacked Mattau and Bakloan, before going to the Dutch to ask for protection from retribution. Although the Dutch were able to force Sinkan's enemies to back down in this case, in later incidents they proved incapable of fully protecting their Formosan allies.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{arrived at}} Ubon Air Base in the Ubon Ratchathani Province of eastern Thailand on 1June 1962 and flew its first operational patrol four days later. Facilities at Ubon were initially spartan, and the pilots and ground crew lived in tents. Construction of permanent accommodation began {{under the supervision}} of No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron in September 1962, however, and facilities were later further improved. Despite Malaysia's policy of neutrality in regards the conflict in Southeast Asia, No.79 Squadron operated as a detachment of the RAAF force (No.78 Wing) based at Butterworth throughout its time in Thailand. Aircraft and personnel were regularly transferred between Butterworth and Ubon, and most pilots' nominally six-month-long tours of duty in Thailand were broken into several shorter periods during which they and their aircraft were illegally rotated between the two bases. In March 1963 the Defence Committee, which was the highest decision-making body of the Department of Defence, recommended to Cabinet that No.79 Squadron be withdrawn from Thailand {{on the grounds that the}} British and New Zealand contingents had left the country. The Cabinet's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee decided against this on 28March as it was believed that maintaining the squadron at Ubon helped <b>maintain</b> <b>good</b> relationships with Thailand and the United States. The Thai Government was discreetly asked if it would prefer a different form of assistance, however.|$|E
