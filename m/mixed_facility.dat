40|$|This study aims to {{find the}} {{knowledge}} for planning nursing home in consideration of behavior and using space patterns of Alzheimer and cerebro vascular- type of dementia who are living in nursing homes. We researched dementia’s behavior during the daytime in nursing homes take care of dementia only (special facility) and other together (<b>mixed</b> <b>facility).</b> As a result, both types were spending on nothing so long, to say quiet action. The level between activity and inactivity with living act divides into both types, and is relation to the independence of mobility. Moreover, the level between primary- need and secondary- need divides into small groups, and is relation to the disorder level of interest and friendship in intellectual abilities. As using space patterns, in the special facility, Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s action area extends wide to a hall and around it. In contrast, cerebro vascular- type’s limits within a hall and semi- hall. In the <b>mixed</b> <b>facility,</b> both types have a limited area in their bedrooms. In concluding, it is important in planning nursing home that both types don’t live together in same space. It is necessary that a hall is prepared for Alzheimer and a semi- hall for cerebro vascular- type in addition to own bedroom as living base...|$|E
40|$|Single Event Upset (SEU) {{measurements}} {{were performed on}} the ESA SEU Monitor using mono-energetic GeV-energy hadron beams available in the North Experimental Area at CERN. A 400 GeV proton beam in the H 4 IRRAD test area and a 120 GeV mixed pion and proton beam at the CERN-EU high Energy Reference Field facility (CERF) were used for this purpose. The resulting cross section values are presented and discussed as well {{as compared to the}} several hundred MeV case (typical for standard test facilities) from a physical interaction perspective with the intention of providing a more general understanding of the behavior. Moreover, the implications of the cross section dependence with energy above the several hundred MeV range are analyzed for different environments. In addition, analogous measurements are proposed for Single Event Latchup (SEL), motivated by discussed simulation results. Finally, a brief introduction of the future CHARM (CERN High-energy AcceleratoR <b>Mixed</b> <b>facility)</b> test installation is included...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} route choice behavior of cyclists in the City of Toronto using {{data collected from}} a smartphone application deployed to {{a large number of}} cyclists in the City. A total 4, 556 cyclists registered for this study and logged over 30, 000 commuting trips and 9, 600 recreational trips over a study period of 9 months. The routes of individual cycling trips were estimated by a map-matching algorithm using second-by-second GPS readings of each trip and Toronto’s cycling road network. Personal information such as age, gender and residence, work or school place was collected from the participants on a voluntary basis. The collected cycling trip data were used to estimate path-size logit route choice models – variant of multinomial logit model for both commuting and recreational trips with various modeling options and combinations of candidate factors. The estimations of the models were evaluated using various performance measures and statistical tests, resulting in findings and conclusions on the optimal modeling structure, the factors that had statistical significant effects on cyclists’ routing decisions and the magnitude of these effects. The modeling results revealed the critical importance of cycling facilities such as bicycle lanes, multiuse pathways and trails on cyclists’ route choice decisions. It was shown that directness as measured by travel distance is the most important factor considered by commuting cyclists in making their route choices. It was also found that cyclists prefer cycling along major streets than local streets and do not mind traveling along transit routes. Furthermore, they tend to choose routes with more bicycle facilities especially dedicated off-street facilities. Comparing to recreational trips, the routes chosen for commuting were in general closer to the routes of minimum distance and energy consumption. In contrast, for recreational trips, cyclists were less concerned about the directness or the degree of challenges of the routes. For these trips, cyclists appeared to place safety at a higher priority instead of time as they showed a higher preference to dedicated bike facilities such as bike lanes and off-street bike paths than on-street <b>mixed</b> <b>facility.</b> Weather and personal attributes were not found to be statistical significant in affecting cyclists’ route choices. These along with other findings from this thesis research have provided valuable information for Toronto’s ongoing effort on bicycle network planning. The results could also be used to enhance route-finding tools available to cyclists for improved cycling experience...|$|E

30|$|The largest {{earthquake}} (M[*]=[*] 2.9) {{occurred at}} 11 : 40 on July 21 (Japan Standard Time in this paper; JST[*]=[*]UTC[*]+[*] 9). A {{few hours after}} the earthquake, one of the SPWs named no. 52 (500  m in depth) started to emit significant amounts of steam and became uncontrollable. Normally, the SPWs in Owakudani are controlled by water injection to the <b>mixing</b> <b>facilities</b> above the well mouth. The blowout condition is thus defined as a status in which available water and the <b>mixing</b> <b>facility</b> are not enough to condensate the steam. At the same time, steam from SPW no. 39 (413  m deep) intensified to nearly blowout condition and proximal hot springs shown in Fig.  2 began steaming vigorously (Tsujiuchi et al. 2003). From SPW no. 52, volcanic gases such as H 2 S, SO 2 and HCl were released and the steam temperature, measured on September 21, 2001, was 163.3  °C (Ohba et al. 2008). On July 22, four deep low-frequency events (DLFs), which is considered to indicate migration of magma or magmatic fluid, were observed.|$|R
