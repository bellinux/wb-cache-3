5|$|In 1990 Northern Irish poet Paul Muldoon {{published}} his long poem Madoc: a Mystery, inspired by Southey's {{work and the}} events surrounding it. Muldoon's work takes as its premise the idea that Southey and Coleridge actually came to America to found their ideal state, and offers a multi-layered poetic exploration of what <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b> It won the 1992 Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize.|$|E
5|$|Beauregard's {{decision}} {{was one of}} the most controversial of the Civil War. Numerous veterans and historians have wondered what <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> if the assault had gone forward into the night. Beauregard believed that the battle was essentially won and his men could finish off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult and Grant's defensive line was heavy with massed artillery and supported by gunboats in the river. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell's Army of the Ohio began arriving that afternoon, and he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the {{political}} division is unknown. It <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> {{at the beginning of}} Peribsen's rule or shortly before. Because Peribsen chose the deity Seth as his new throne patron, Egyptologists are of the view that Peribsen was a chieftain from Thinis or a prince of the Thinite royal house. This theory is based on Seth being a deity of Thinite origin, which would explain Peribsen's choice: his name changing may have been nothing more than smart political (and religious) propaganda. Peribsen is thought to have gained the Thinite throne and ruled only Upper Egypt, whilst other rulers held the Memphite throne and ruled Lower Egypt.|$|E

5|$|Linda Schuyler had co-created The Kids of Degrassi Street in 1979 with Kit Hood, and Yan Moore was {{a writer}} on that series. As the {{children}} grew up, the Degrassi franchise developed into Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High. In 1999 two episodes of Jonovision, a CBC Television talk show aimed at teenagers, reunited some of the cast members from the series. At the same time, Schuyler and Moore were developing a new television drama. When the Jonovision reunion episode proved to be popular, Schuyler and Moore wondered about reuniting the characters, too. As the months passed, they began thinking about what <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> to the characters of Degrassi High and realized that the character Emma Nelson, born {{at the end of}} Degrassi Junior Highs second season, would soon be entering junior high school. Stephen Stohn, Schuyler's husband suggested Degrassi: The Next Generation as the name for the new sequel series, borrowing the concept from , of which he was a fan.|$|E
5|$|Toivonen's crash {{remains a}} mystery because it had no close witnesses. Although it was caught on tape by a spectator further down the stage, {{it proved to be}} {{impossible}} to determine the cause of the crash from the footage. No race marshalls were close to the scene to notice the black smoke and no-one at the race finish knew about the crash. Toivonen's team only started to fear something <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> after he failed to arrive from the stage on schedule. The next rally crew through the stage then mentioned they had seen some black smoke. By the time the emergency vehicles arrived on the crash scene, they could only put down the flames, which had been fanned by breezes. Lancia engineers and technicians could not determine the cause of the crash because the remains of the car were so charred.|$|E
25|$|Both Bouazizi's {{mother and}} the {{eyewitness}} who spoke with Asharq Al-Awsat stated that Hamdi's aides had kicked and beaten him after confiscating his fruit cart. Faida Hamdi states it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> and Asharq Al-Awsat denies it did.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the many}} {{writings}} of Henana very {{little has been}} preserved, and the Church of the East hasrejected him. But in order to refute him, Babai the Great clarified the Christology of the Church of the East, which otherwise <b>might</b> not <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|R
50|$|Very {{little of}} his poetic work has {{stood the test}} of time and is {{considered}} of value today. However, if it wasn't for bards of his generation keeping the tradition of Cynghanedd alive through those dark and unproductive days, strict meter <b>might</b> <b>have</b> fallen out of use and the revival of a golden age of cynghanedd in the 20th century <b>might</b> not <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|R

25|$|Miguel Hermoso's La luz prodigiosa (The End of a Mystery) is a Spanish film {{based on}} Fernando Macías' novel {{with the same}} name, which {{examines}} what <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> if García Lorca had survived his execution {{at the outset of}} the Spanish Civil War.|$|E
25|$|Sandra Lerner's {{sequel to}} Pride and Prejudice, Second Impressions, {{develops}} {{the story and}} imagined what <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> to the original novel's characters.

25|$|There was no autopsy held on Dan or Steve, {{and there}} have been many stories about what <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b> The {{arrangement}} of their bodies in the hotel suggests they may have killed themselves. This was the story that was used in the first Kelly film, The Story of the Kelly Gang in 1906, and in the 2003 Ned Kelly movie.|$|E

40|$|Some {{problems}} {{occurred during}} the SPEAR 3 magnet production at IHEP, China. It {{was very hard to}} find resolution from existing knowledge of those problems. It was possible that similar problems <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happen</b> in building accelerator magnet in other institutes before, but they were not addressed in public papers. These problems were discussed and solved by engineers from both SLAC and IHEP after conducting certain experiments. Traditionally, the magnet design and measurement data have been always well documented and addressed in papers, but the production experiences have not been recorded adequately. It is the goal of this paper to record the problems and their resolutions during SPEAR 3 magnet production at IHEP China, which will certainly benefit future magnet projects...|$|R
60|$|Oh! what <b>might</b> not <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> {{before we}} could get there! I thought I was used enough to suspense, I who had heard the rattle of the musketry {{in more than one}} battle, but I should have been wild had not that best of women held my hands and soothed me and helped me to say my prayers.|$|R
25|$|Although {{controversy}} continues {{regarding what}} <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> if Lucas {{had been more}} aggressive from the start, most commentators agree that the initial plan for Anzio was flawed. They question whether the initial landing of just over two infantry divisions, with no supporting armour, {{had the strength to}} achieve the objectives: of cutting Route 6 and then holding off the inevitable counterattacks that would come, as Kesselring redeployed his forces.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, a new 20-month {{contract}} was signed. Section 2(b) was preserved. Workers received a 7-cent an hour pay increase, 4.25 {{cents an hour}} lower than the Kaiser Steel settlement and far lower than anything McDonald had demanded. For the first time, however, the union won an automatic cost-of-living wage adjustment and greatly improved pension and health benefits. McDonald trumpeted the settlement as a great victory, compared to what <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ian Chappell... made {{it clear}} more than once that he {{regarded}} the control of his side on the field as the concern solely of the umpires. Poor wretched men! I wonder what Ian thought <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> if either Tom Brooks or Robin Bailhache had applied the full sanction of Law 46, and had banned either Lillee or Thomson on that emotion-charged Sunday afternoon. How many beer-cans might have bespattered the field, and angry spectators invaded the playing area? As it was the umpires contented themselves with friendly warnings afterwards described as 'unofficial'. In the circumstances {{it was hard to}} blame them.|$|E

25|$|Mark O'Flynn's play titled Eleanor and Eve speculates what <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> had Australian writers Eve Langley and Eleanor Dark met. While both {{lived in}} the Katoomba area at the same time, Dark from 1934 and Langley from the early 1960s to 1974, there is no {{evidence}} that they ever met. The play was first performed in 2002 at Varuna, Eleanor Dark's home which is now a writers' centre, with the audience moving between rooms as the play progressed. In 2003, it was performed in a more traditional space at the Railway St. Theatre in Penrith, New South Wales.|$|E
25|$|Regarding Sophoniba, {{her story}} {{provides}} {{a perspective on}} the rivalry between the two kings, Syphax of Masaesyli (west Numidia) and Masinissa of Massyli (east Numidia). Her story also sheds light {{on the relationship between}} Carthage and the Berbers, with particular reference to Rome. Livy (59 BC–AD 17), the Roman historian, presents a rather detailed portrait of these circumstances, especially events following the defeat of her husband Syphax. Such details may shed light on the personality of Masinissa, or at least on the world in which he lived. Yet ancient historians were not unfamiliar with propaganda and their readers expected them to recreate scenes, giving memorable, probable versions of what <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E
25|$|Around {{the same}} time, police in Staffordshire {{claimed that the}} {{disappearance}} of the girls was linked to an abduction in the county the previous year, when a six-year-old girl had survived an attack by an abductor who was still at large and whose green Ford Mondeo was identified as having number-plates which had been stolen in Peterborough. The same man was also believed to have followed a 12-year-old girl in the same area, when his car was fitted with number-plates which had been stolen in Nottinghamshire. The same vehicle had since been spotted in Glatton, also in Cambridgeshire. This information was included in an appeal on Crimewatch, but did not shed any light on what <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> to the two missing girls.|$|E

25|$|On May 27, 2006, a 20-year-old male park {{employee}} from Birdseye, Indiana {{died after}} being pinned under the lawn mower he was using. The {{man was a}} supervisor for the park's grounds department. The employee was working alone, mowing an area with some inclines outside {{the east side of}} the park when the incident occurred, though the park refused to speculate on exactly what <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened.</b> The man was found by another employee, who was then able to help lift the lawn mower off the victim with the help of other employees. Park emergency medical technicians and Spencer County EMS summoned a medical helicopter from St. Mary's Hospital and Medical Center in Evansville, Indiana, but the employee was pronounced dead before it arrived.|$|E
25|$|When Harry {{arrives at}} the Burrow in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Molly finds out about Fred and George's {{experimentation}} with dangerous sweets they were manufacturing and tells them off before leaving for the Quidditch World Cup; however, after the Dark Mark appears over the sky at the World Cup campsite, Molly is upset for yelling at Fred and George, worried that something <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> to them after she treated them so horribly. Towards the climax of that book, Molly and Bill arrive at Hogwarts to see the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament, acting as family guests to Harry. After the return of Voldemort, Dumbledore asks Molly and Bill to join the Order and fight in the impending Second War. Molly comforts Harry and, {{for the first time}} in his life, he has someone to be there for him, like a mother.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} notable periods of Malta's history is the temple period, {{starting}} around 3600 BC. The Ġgantija Temple in Gozo {{is one of the}} oldest free-standing buildings in the world. The name of the complex stems from the Maltese word ġgant, which reflects the magnitude of the temple's size. Many of the temples are in the form of five semicircular rooms connected at the centre. It has been suggested that these might have represented the head, arms and legs of a deity, since one of the commonest kinds of statue found in these temples is a fat woman — a symbol of fertility. The Temple period lasted until about 2500 BC, at which point the civilization that raised these huge monoliths seems to have disappeared. There is much speculation about what <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> and whether they were completely wiped out or assimilated.|$|E
