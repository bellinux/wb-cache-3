40|$|Stroke is {{a common}} cause of life-long {{disability}} in surviving patients. Despite improvements in neurologic deficits, stroke survivors remain with important limitations on participating in social activities, on reintegrating into family, community and working life which could trigger psychological problems and a decreased quality of life (QoL). An important issue in post-stroke rehabilitation is improvement of patient’s quality of life. Introduction: The assessment of the Quality of Life could be {{an indicator of the}} effectiveness of the post–stroke rehabilitation. One simple instrument for assessment of Qol is the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS), created by John Flanagan, which has been adapted for use in chronic illness groups, a higher score indicating higher quality of life. An important instrument for improving QoL of stroke patients is combined rehabilitation therapy in a balneoclimacteric resort or in a rehabilitation hospital. This study aimed to monitor the efficacy of these natural therapeutic factors, used in conjunction with classical neurorehabilitation methods in post-stroke patients Material and method: We performed a prospective longitudinal analysis in 50 post-stroke patients which performed rehabilitation treatment: the first group of 20 patients performed only kinesitheraly, massages, occupational therapy during 15 days at Rehabilitation Hospital Cluj, and the second group of 30 patients performed the same treatment during 15 days, in association with with carbonated mineral water baths and walking at Tușnad Spa Complex SA treatment facility in Băile Tușnad. Quality of Life of both group of patients was assessed using the QOL Scale. Results: Both groups showed statistically significant improvements in the QoL as shown by comparing the mean score before and after treatment by the paired T test, with a p value of < 0, 05 in both groups. Conclusion: Rehabilitation treatment improve the qualty of life in stroke survivors.

40|$|Introduction. Stroke {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of {{morbidity}} and mortality worldwide. Hypotonic carbonated mineral waters in Băile Tușnad are used for their peripheral and cerebral vasodilator effects in the prophylaxis, therapy and rehabilitation of cardiovascular patients. Objectives. The aim of the clinical study was to assess the efficacy of natural therapeutic factors in Băile Tușnad for continuing the rehabilitation of post-stroke patients in a spa and climatic resort for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Methods. The study included 30 patients with a history of stroke, aged between 56 and 89 years, with a mean age of 69 years, at the Facility Treatment of the Tușnad Spa Complex SA, in the period April-December 2014. The clinical study was a prospective longitudinal analysis. Of all 30 patients, 50 % had ischemic stroke, 43 % transient cerebral ischemic attack, and 7 % hemorrhagic stroke. Hemiparesis was the most frequent clinical sign, followed by coordination, balance and gait disorders. Patients attended rehabilitation treatment consisting of kinesiotherapy, carbonated mineral water baths for 15 minutes, aerotherapy for 30 minutes daily, <b>massotherapy,</b> performed daily for 16 days. Each patient was clinically assessed before and after treatment based on the TINETTI Balance Scale, the 10 -m walk test, the Motor Assessment Scale, the BARTHEL Index, adverse reactions. Results. At the end of treatment, an improvement in the walking speed, a statistically significant improvement in the quality of gait were observed, p < 0. 05. Statistically significant results p< 0. 05 were also obtained for balance. On the Motor Assessment Scale, by comparing the means before and after treatment with the paired T test, a statistically significant value p< 0. 05 was obtained. When evaluating the patients’ performance for 10 activities of daily living depending on the need for external assistance, using the Barthel Index, the value of p < 0. 05 was statistically significant. There were no side reactions to the treatment applied. Conclusions. Natural therapeutic factors, i. e., carbonated mineral water baths and aerotherapy, along with kinesiotherapy, indicated for rehabilitation treatment in post-stroke patients, influenced the clinical and functional picture, determining a significant improvement of the quality of gait, balance, and an increase in the autonomy of these patients. Continuing the rehabilitation treatment, in the absence of contraindications, in spa and climatic resorts, is extremely important and necessary for post-stroke patients...|$|E
40|$|Aim of research. An {{assessment}} of the CNS state, neuropsychological indicators and influence of the modern methods of physical rehabilitation on the dynamics of vegetative adaptive and compensatory brain systems in patients with effects of an early organic lesion of nervous system. Materials and methods of research. There were examined and treated 20 children 7 - 11 years old. An {{assessment of}} vegetative homeostasis was carried out using cardiointervalography (CIG), neuropsychic functions and deficiency of statomotor development – the method of Luriya neuropsychological testing. The children of the first group (10 persons) underwent massage and therapeutic physical training with {{special attention to the}} dynamic stereotype in complex with generally developmental, breathing, special passive and active, static and dynamic exercises, postisometric relaxation, <b>massotherapy.</b> The patients of the second group (10 persons) underwent traditional therapeutic physical training and massage. Results of research. It was observed an inhibition of the humoral control of heart rate in examined children {{and at the same time}} an activation of sympathetic system. As a result it was detected an increase of the stress index of compensatory reactions of organism (stress index SI — 124 un. at the norm 65, 0 ud.). Neuropsychological features of these patients indicated the presence of the left hemispheric and less right hemispheric deficiency, dysfunction of subcortical and stem structures. The use of the complex methodology of rehabilitation with special attention to the dynamic stereotype and manual therapy according to the aspects of genesis of myofascial dysfunction favored an optimization of the stress of compensatory mechanisms of organism (SI — 51, 0 un.). In the second group it was observed a stable activity of sympathetic regulation of the heart rate compared with indicators before treatment and an insignificant decrease of the stress index of vegetative balance (SI — 74, 0 un.). The more significant dynamics of the state of the high integrative functions and indicators of visual and auditory gnosis was also attained in the first group of treatment. Conclusions. The use of schemes of treatment according to the state of organization of the motor functions, aspects of genesis of myofascial dysfunction with special attention to vegetative regulation favor an increase of the level of high cortical functions and ensure the regulative influence of central structures on motility and regulation of the heart rate. </p...|$|E
