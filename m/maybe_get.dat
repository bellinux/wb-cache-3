500|$|In a 2012 interview, Glenn {{said that}} the purpose of his flight was [...] "to make {{measurements}} and do research on me at the age of 77... comparing the results on me in space with the younger [...] and <b>maybe</b> <b>get</b> [...] on the immune system or protein turnover or vestibular functions and other things—heart changes". Glenn also said that after reading a study on aerospace medicine, he was intrigued at how the physiological changes experienced by the human body in space (such as loss of bone and muscle mass and blood plasma) were {{similar to those of the}} human body as it ages. He regretted that NASA did not continue its research on aging by sending additional elderly people into space. After STS-95 returned safely, its crew received a ticker-tape parade. On October 15, 1998, NASA Road 1 (the main route to the Johnson Space Center) was temporarily renamed John Glenn Parkway for several months. In 2001, Glenn strenuously opposed sending Dennis Tito, the world's first space tourist, to the International Space Station because Tito's trip had no scientific purpose.|$|E
500|$|He {{made his}} first {{appearance}} for York following his return a day after making his final appearance for Barrow, coming on as a 61st-minute substitute for Liam Shepherd in a 2–2 draw at home to Crawley on 23 November 2008. Brodie scored York's equaliser in the following match away to Salisbury City on 29 November 2008 with a goal in the 83rd minute, which finished as a 1–1 draw in Martin Foyle's first match as manager. After picking up a yellow card against Salisbury, his fifth of the season for York, he was handed a one-match suspension which saw him miss the match against Grays Athletic. He scored with a 25-yard shot on his return away to Histon on 9 December 2008, which finished as a 1–1 draw. He scored twice against Northwich in the FA Trophy first round as York progressed with a 2–0 away victory, Foyle rating Brodie's first as the [...] "goal of the season". Foyle also stated his desire for Brodie to stay at York, after continued reports of interest from Barrow. Barrow joint-manager David Bayliss said he was unlikely to table a bid for Brodie in January 2009, claiming [...] "If we had {{a hell of a}} lot of money we could <b>maybe</b> <b>get</b> him away but we haven't". Foyle responded by saying he had no intention of selling Brodie.|$|E
500|$|Fearnet critic Alyse Wax wrote [...] "This episode made {{my brain}} hurt. [...] And I {{mean that in}} the nicest way possible. They were {{throwing}} a lot of weird shit at us. It was great because I feel like we are finally getting answers, like we will finally get some closure, and just <b>maybe</b> <b>get</b> rid of the Red universe stiffs. This episode was so ridiculously dense I am sure I missed some of the deeper scientific facts. I got the gist of it, though, and frankly, I much prefer these jam-packed episodes. I like when the puzzle pieces start falling into place. It's calming." [...] SFScope's Sarah Stegall believed the episode [...] "start out interestingly enough", but unlike other reviewers, she was very critical of the First People mythology, stating [...] "This is where my disbelief not only stopped being suspended, it {{got up and walked}} out of the room... I still don't like the premise of the evolution of an entire hominid species that left not one single solitary fossil behind. It's more like fantasy than science fiction." [...] Stegall praised Torv's acting as she plays [...] "two people very subtly, very convincingly", and concluded her review by commenting she will continue to watch the series because she trusts the writers will [...] "supply us with plausible answers from time to time", but is [...] "losing some respect for it".|$|E

500|$|The show, {{entitled}} Keeping Up With the Kardashians, premiered on October 14, 2007. The reality series {{centers around}} {{the members of the}} Kardashian-Jenner blended family, focusing on the sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khloé. Most episodes have very similar structure: the family [...] "show off their privileged lifestyle and <b>maybe</b> <b>get</b> into one or two minor family squabbles before ultimately wrapping things up with a monologue that reinforces the importance of family," [...] as noted by Caroline Siede of Quartz. Harriet Ryan and Adam Tschorn of the Los Angeles Times described the reality series as a: [...] "Hollywood version of The Brady Bunch -- the harmless high jinks of a loving blended family against a backdrop of wealth and famous connections". Kim Kardashian described the beginning of filming the show, [...] "When we first started , we came together as a family and said, 'If we're going to do this reality show, we're going to be 100 percent who we really are.'". She further commented on the show's authenticity by saying that the network [...] "has never once put anything out there that we haven't approved of or accepted". The series was renewed for a second season one month after its premiere due to high ratings. Seacrest described the show's success: [...] "At the heart of the seriesdespite the catfights and endless sarcasmis a family that truly loves and supports one another [...] The familiar dynamics of this family make them one Hollywood bunch that is sure to entertain." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Dunbar {{became known}} in the 1930s and 1940s as [...] "the hub of Los Angeles black culture," [...] and [...] "the heart of Saturday night Los Angeles." [...] In its heyday, it was known as [...] "a West Coast mixture of the Waldorf-Astoria and the Cotton Club." [...] The Los Angeles Herald-Examiner {{described}} the Dunbar this way:”It was once the most glorious place on 'the Avenue.' [...] At the Dunbar Hotel … you could dance {{to the sounds of}} Cab Calloway, laugh till your stomach hurt with Redd Foxx and maybe, just <b>maybe,</b> <b>get</b> a room near Billie Holiday or Duke Ellington.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Murray {{wanted to}} work on a Comics Code-approved series in order to reach a broader audience. He said, [...] "I wanted a way to at least tell a part of the story to the kids and <b>maybe</b> <b>get</b> other people to talk about it as well." [...] However, because of the Code, {{he was not able to}} address things like drug use or include swearing. Hama and Murray wanted to ignore {{politics}} and focus on the war from the average foot soldier's point of view. Murray said that the comic was [...] "a pretty accurate view of the way the average soldier looked at the war. It was outside ordinary experience. The world was elsewhere." [...] Murray decided to do the comic book in real-time so that one issue equaled one month to convey the concept of short-time.|$|E
2500|$|Williams stated {{his love}} for Toronto and {{mentioned}} the possibility of returning to the Canadian game during his professional career. [...] "I was thinking it wouldn't be bad to come back up here and kind of follow the same steps as Pinner – play here a couple years and <b>maybe</b> <b>get</b> a chance to coach up here", Williams said. [...] "Because I really like Toronto, I really like this organization … you can live here, you know? You {{feel like you have}} a life. I come to work, I go home, play with my kid, walk to the store. It's really nice. I get to teach. It's wonderful here." [...] In another interview, he expressed further desire to remain in the CFL, [...] "If I came back here, you can put me anywhere", he says. [...] "Up here, I can play offense, defense, special teams. I can do everything. I can block, play tight end, running back, receiver— even play the line. The NFL is so structured— 'You do this.' Here I can do so much." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the most}} {{dramatic}} segments along the route occur in this area as the train clings precariously to the mountainsides – particularly Groundhog Mountain and Mount Cheadle. One place in particular is known as Little Hells Gate (Port d'Enfer), an area featuring treacherous rapids on the river similar to those in Hells Gate farther south on the Fraser River. Passengers will note railway slide fences {{on one side of the}} train. These wire fences protect the tracks and train from falling debris. When a wire breaks or is compromised, it sends a signal to stop or proceed at a much slower speed. As it is, the train creeps along at a cautious pace – [...] – along this stretch. It is not difficult to see why. On the other side of the train are views to the North Thompson River down below as well as toward the often-snow-covered mountains in the distance. One of the prettiest sights in this area is of Pyramid Falls, which cascades [...] down the side of Mount Cheadle. The train slows down enough for passengers to get close-up looks and <b>maybe</b> <b>get</b> a nice picture or two. The Cariboo Mountains and Slide Mountain are to the west. Malton Range is to the east. The train crosses the Canoe River over a [...] bridge shortly before arriving Valemount. It was also south of Valemount and north of the Canoe River where the Canoe River crash occurred on November 21, 1950. Memorials can be seen from the train. The icefields of the Albreda Glacier should be visible for several miles.|$|E

If I'm in a position where we are looking to gain good points, and it's an unnecessary risk to make a manoeuvre, then I won't be doing that. It's always important to be fast, but it's not necessarily the fastest car that wins.

2500|$|Björkman and Ullyett's loss to Fyrstenberg and Matkowski {{marked the}} last career match of the Swede Jonas Björkman, who had {{announced}} his retirement {{at the end of}} the year, after a seventeen-year career, started in 1991, at the Swedish Open in Båstad. In singles, Björkman won six career titles, and went as high as the 4th place in the rankings, in 1997, reaching two Grand Slam semifinals at the 1997 US Open (lost to Rusedski), and at the 2006 Wimbledon Championships (lost to Federer). A former World No. 1 in doubles, Björkman won fifty-four career doubles titles, including nine Grand Slam crowns (runner-up at six more). [...] He was one of four active doubles players at the time of the Masters Cup to have completed a career Grand Slam (with Bob and Mike Bryan, and Daniel Nestor), and two year-end championships titles, in 1994 and 2006. Björkman, who mainly partnered during his career with Jan Apell, Nicklas Kulti, Todd Woodbridge, Max Mirnyi and Kevin Ullyett, also finished runner-up at two mixed doubles Grand Slam finals at Wimbledon, with Anna Kournikova in 1999, and Alicia Molik in 2007, and was part of the Sweden Davis Cup team for their last three championships in 1994, 1997 and 1998. Upon retirement, as a ceremony was taking place for him, following his loss to Fyrstenberg and Matkowski, Björkman declared: [...] "We were hoping to <b>maybe</b> <b>get</b> through [...] I still think it's great to end my career in the biggest event of the year. But you can't get everything. I've been mentally prepared for this because I'm mentally very ready to retire. [...] I've been very fortunate to be able to play for so long.
