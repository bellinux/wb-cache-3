40|$|Abstract: Purpose: Treatment of <b>Mallet</b> <b>fingers</b> or {{fractures}} {{remains a}} controversial topic. No evident preference can be distilled from {{the reports of}} the clinical results obtained by conservative treatment with splints and internal fixation. If op-erative treatment is indicated, several techniques can be used. However, each technique has disadvantages like the risk of comminution of the fragment, the risk of infection and necrosis, a demanding operative technique and-or the necessity of removing the metallic devices. This can be avoided {{by the use of}} biodegradable devices. The purpose of this feasibility study was to evaluate the outcome of internal fixation of a Mallet fracture with a biodegradable device, the Meniscus Ar-row. Methods: We treated nine consecutive patients with a Mallet fracture by fixation of the fragment with a biodegradable Meniscus Arrow, at this moment the smallest device available, with an average operation time of 14 minutes. Results: Postoperatively, no complications were found. All patients were satisfied by the results after surgery, with a re-stored range of motion in the distal interphalangeal joint as previously and good alignment with full consolidation of all fractures at radiological evaluation. Conclusions: The operative treatment of bony <b>mallet</b> <b>fingers</b> with the Meniscus Arrow is a fast procedure without com-plications in our prospective series of nine patients and without the need of a second operation to remove the implant...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mallet</b> <b>fingers</b> with an {{avulsion}} {{fracture of}} the distal phalanx or rupture {{of the terminal}} tendon of the extensor mechanism {{is known as a}} common injury, while mallet thumb is very rare.

5000|$|Patients {{that present}} with <b>mallet</b> <b>finger</b> will have pain at the DIP joint, {{and will be}} unable to extend the joint.

Surgical treatment is used when the <b>mallet</b> <b>finger</b> presents as an open injury or if the bony mallet involves more than 30% of the articular surface of the joint.

Methods: Forty-seven patients were operated on between April 2004 and February 2012. The average follow-up period was 19. 6 (range: 8 to 44) months. Results: According to the Crawford criteria, the results were excellent in 32 patients (69 %), good in 12 patients (26 %) and fair in 3 patients (6 %). The mean range of motion was from 3 ° (extensor lag) (range: 0 and deg; to 15 and deg;) to 71 ° (range: 60 and deg; to 80 and deg;) flexion. As complications, five patients developed mild degenerative changes, three had pin tract infections, one had temporary nail ridging, and three had skin sloughing.

Treatment usually involves splint immobilisation of the distal interphalangeal joint or operative treatment {{if there is a}} fracture fragment of more than one third of the articular surface or a palmar subluxation of the distal phalanx. We examined 25 out of 49 consecutive patients treated with the Ishiguro extension block technique in our department to assess the long-term clinical and radiological results. Of the 49 patients with median age of 35 (range 14 - 74) years, 15 men and 10 women met for a three-year follow up. Scored by Crawford classification we had one excellent, two good, 14 fair and seven poor results.

5000|$|Once {{a patient}} has been struck with <b>mallet</b> <b>finger,</b> ice {{should be applied}} {{immediately}} and the patient’s arm should be elevated above the heart {{in order to reduce}} blood circulation to the fingers. This is because this reduces inflammation, which causes further damage. The patient should be seen by a doctor within a week after the injury. Treatment options include surgery or putting the finger in a Mallet splint for 6 to 8 weeks or extension block k-wire for 4 weeks. The splint allows the tendon to return to normal length, if the finger is bent during these weeks the healing process must start all over again. Surgery is used to reattach the tendon and is usually performed within a week of the injury.|$|E

40|$|In adults, <b>mallet</b> <b>finger</b> is a {{traumatic}} zone I lesion of the extensor tendon with either tendon rupture or bony avulsion {{at the base}} of the distal phalanx. High-energy mechanisms of injury generally occur in young men, whereas lower energy mechanisms are observed in elderly women. The mechanism of injury is an axial load applied to a straight digit tip, which is then followed by passive extreme distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ) hyperextension or hyperflexion. <b>Mallet</b> <b>finger</b> is diagnosed clinically, but an X-ray should always be performed. Tubiana's classification takes into account the size of the bony articular fragment and DIPJ subluxation. We propose to stage subluxated fractures as stage III if the subluxation is reducible with a splint and as stage IV if not. Left untreated, <b>mallet</b> <b>finger</b> becomes chronic and leads to a swan-neck deformity and DIPJ osteoarthritis. The goal of treatment is to restore active DIPJ extension. The results of a six- to eight-week conservative course of treatment with a DIPJ splint in slight hyperextension for tendon lesions or straight for bony avulsions depends on patient compliance. Surgical treatments vary in terms of the approach, the reduction technique, and the means of fixation. The risks involved are stiffness, septic arthritis, and osteoarthritis.

40|$|Introduction: It is {{commonly}} thought that Salter–Harris type I or II appears in mallet fingers in childhood, with S–H type III appearing in adolescence. Presentation of case: We present {{a case of}} bony <b>mallet</b> <b>finger</b> in childhood.

Open reduction and fixation were performed and bone union was achieved without complications. Discussion: Bony <b>mallet</b> <b>finger</b> in childhood manifests as S–H types I, II, and III in typical cases. However, it depends on narrowing of the epiphysis {{and the strength of}} the axial forces on the tip of the distal phalanx. In the case of epiphysis narrowing and only small forces affecting the region, an avulsion fracture without injury to the epiphyseal plate will occur in rare cases.

40|$|An old, but {{hitherto}} unpublished, {{method for}} surgical correction of chronic <b>mallet</b> <b>finger</b> {{was carried out}} in 42 patients. In the abbrevatio operation, the elongated tendon is transected and resutured, after which the developing fibrous scar tissue usually causes adequate shrinkage for correcting the drop-deformity. The D. I. P. joint is transfixed with a K wire in slight hyperextension for six weeks. Forty patients were studied. The result was excellent in 16 patients (40 %), good in 20 %, fair in 17. 5 % and poor in 22. 5 %. On average, the extension defect was decreased from 38. 2 % to 11. 8 %. The method is a suitable alternative in patients with annoying chronic <b>mallet</b> <b>finger</b> who refuse arthrodesis or further conservative treatment. Journal of Hand Surgery (British Volume, 1989) 14 B: 347 - 349 <b>Mallet</b> <b>finger,</b> due to laceration or disruption of the distal attachment of the extensor tendon, is a common but minor disability. In most cases, simple splintage of the D. I. P. joint alone will correct the deformity. The cure rate is, however, rather variable, ranging from 38 % (Warren et al., 1988) to 72 % (Abouna et al., 1968). An outstanding cure rate of 92 % has been achieved by Olsen (1981). The failures occur after one to two months; the risk factors are a delay of more than four weeks in seeking treatment, an extension defect more than 50 ”, short thick fingers, a patient aged more than 60 and, of course carelessness of the patient in regard to the splint and its correct position (Abouna et al., 1968). Early conservative treatment of the acute <b>mallet</b> <b>finger</b> and close control of the splintage is therefore important to avoid chronic <b>mallet</b> <b>finger.</b> Further treatment may be indicated if the mallet deformity becomes functionally, cosmetically or symptomatically unacceptable to the patient.

40|$|Since the <b>mallet</b> <b>finger</b> that {{is treated}} with {{isolated}} splinting of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint {{can be moved}} freely proximal to the DIP joint, we sought to determine whether such motion might cause a tendon gap that could explain the extensor lag that often follows treatment. Experiments were performed on 32 cadaveric fingers with open <b>mallet</b> <b>finger</b> lesions, immobilizing either the DIP joint alone or both the DIP and PIP joints, while repeatedly flexing and extending the more proximal finger and wrist joints. For each experiment, {{the gap in the}} extensor tendon was measured. Joint motion proximal to the DIP joint and retraction of the intrinsics did not cause a tendon gap in a finger with a mallet lesion, supporting the convention that only the DIP joint needs to be immobilized.

Objective Our paper had several research Objectives: presentation of the existing Results of surgical and nonsurgical treatment of <b>mallet</b> <b>finger</b> deformities and comparison of our findings and other authors’ Results. Method: The study was retro-prospective, and analyzed 62 patients treated in the Clinical Center of Serbia in Belgrade (at the Institute of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology, and the Emergency Center) in the period 1998 to 2003. The follow up of these patients lasted at least 8 months (from 8. 3 months to 71. 7 months). An average follow up was 28. 7 months.

40|$|<b>Mallet</b> <b>finger</b> is the {{deformity}} {{caused by}} a tear of the extensor expansion from its attachment {{to the base of}} the terminal phalanx.

40|$|Introduction <b>Mallet</b> <b>finger</b> is {{a common}} injury {{involving}} either an extensor tendon rupture at its insertion or an avulsion fracture involving the insertion of the terminal extensor tendon. It is usually caused by a forceful blow {{to the tip of}} the finger causing sudden flexion or a hyperextension injury. Fracture at the dorsal aspect of the base of the distal phalanx is commonly associated with palmar subluxation of the distal phalanx. Most <b>mallet</b> <b>finger</b> injuries are recommended to be treated with immobilization of the distal interphalangeal joint in extension by splints. However, surgical fixation is still indicated in certain conditions such as open injuries, avulsion fracture involving at least one third of the articular surface with or without palmar subluxation of the distal phalanx and also failed splinting treatment. This study was designed to identify the strongest peak load resistance among four <b>mallet</b> <b>finger</b> fracture fixation methods, namely Kirschner wire fixation, pull-out wire fixation, tension-band wire fixation and the JuggerKnot? (Biomet) soft anchor fixation and to assess the role of the JuggerKnot? technique in <b>mallet</b> <b>finger</b> fixation. Materials and method Four different fixation techniques were assigned among twenty-four specimens (all fingers, no thumbs) from six cadaveric human hands in a randomized block fashion. Only one technique was performed on each finger. A downward load was applied to flex the distal phalanx and the maximum loading force was recorded. The load was tested at 30 degrees, 45 degrees and 60 degrees of flexion of the distal interphalangeal joint. Two separate data sets were performed for each finger before and after the osteotomy and fixation. The data underwent Shapiro-Wilk normality testing before analysis. The values of the mean peak load of the four groups were compared using the one-way analysis of variance test in SPSS version 19. 0. Result All data points passed the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality. The mean peak load of the tension-band wiring group was 67. 8 N at 60 degrees of flexion which was significantly higher than the other three groups (p= 0. 008). The JuggerKnot? fixation had mean peak loads of 13. 35 N (30 °), 22. 51 N (45 °) and 32. 96 N (60 °) which were all above the required load for mobilization. No complications of implant failure or fragmentation of the dorsal fragment was noted. Discussion The tension-band wire fixation was the strongest fixation method among the four. However it was cumbersome and it had the most soft tissue trauma among the four. No major difficulty was encountered during the testing. No fragmentation of the dorsal fragment was encountered during the procedures. The JuggerKnot? soft anchor fixation was a simple and easy technique and did not require trans-articular Kirschner wire fixation for protection. It could reduce and immobilize a grossly displaced dorsal fragment easily and allowed for safe immediate mobilization of the joint after operation as indicated by the peak load results. This fixation technique was a viable option for treating <b>mallet</b> <b>finger</b> injuries with a dorsal bony fragment size at least one-third of the articular surface with or without palmar subluxation of the distal phalanx. published_or_final_versionOrthopaedics and TraumatologyMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|E

This case describes how a <b>mallet</b> <b>finger</b> deformity was sustained by a consultant obstetrician whilst attempting to deliver a fetus with shoulder dystocia. Although this is a rare type of injury, it had significant impact on the consultant’s ability to provide clinical care for some time. Disruptions in service provision have direct financial consequences to the healthcare system. This case report highlights the importance of reporting these injuries at the workplace...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Mallet</b> <b>finger</b> is {{a common}} injury. The aim of this review is to give an {{overview}} of the different treatment options of mallet injuries and their indications, outcomes, and potential complications. Methods: A literature-based study was conducted using the PubMed database comprising world literature from January of 1980 until January of 2010. The following search terms were used: "mallet" and "finger. " Results: There are many variations in the design of splints; there are, however, only a few studies that compare the type of splints with one another. Splinting appears to be effective in uncomplicated and complicated cases. Equal results have been reported for early and delayed splinting therapy. To internally fixate a <b>mallet</b> <b>finger,</b> many different techniques have been reported; however, none of these studies examined their comparisons in a controlled setting. In chronic mallet injuries, a tenodermodesis followed by splinting or a tenotomy of the central slip is usually performed. If pain and impairment persist despite previous surgical corrective attempts, an arthrodesis of the distal interphalangeal joint should be performed. Conclusions: Uncomplicated cases of mallet injuries are best treated by splinting therapy; cases that do not react to splinting therapy are best treated by surgical interventions. Controversy remains about whether mallet injuries with a larger dislocated bone fragment are best treated by surgery or by external splinting. (Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 126 : 1624, 2010. ...|$|E
