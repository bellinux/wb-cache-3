5000|$|Blood {{carbon dioxide}} (PaCO2) levels {{generally}} vary inversely with <b>minute</b> volume. For example, {{a person with}} increased <b>minute</b> volume (e.g. due to hyperventilation) should demonstrate a lower blood carbon dioxide level. The healthy human body will alter <b>minute</b> volume {{in an attempt to}} maintain physiologic homeostasis. A normal <b>minute</b> volume while resting is about 5-8 liters per <b>minute</b> in humans. <b>Minute</b> volume generally decreases when at rest, and increases with exercise. For example, during light activities <b>minute</b> volume may be around 12 litres. Riding a bicycle increases <b>minute</b> ventilation by a factor of 2 to 4 depending on the level of exercise involved. <b>Minute</b> ventilation during moderate exercise may be between 40 and 60 litres per <b>minute.</b>|$|R
