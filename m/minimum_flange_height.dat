40|$|Chain-die forming is a {{promising}} manufacturing {{technology that is}} emerging {{as an alternative to}} roll forming and stamping in fabricating advanced high-strength steel (AHSS) products. The maximum edge longitudinal membrane strain (MELMS) and the springback are regarded as the crucial indicators for evaluating the quality of fabricated AHSS products. As Chain-die forming is a newly developed sheet metal fabricating method, the evaluations and predictions {{of the effects of the}} independent product parameters on MELMS and springback are of high interest. This paper selects three important quantitative product parameters (tensile strength, <b>flange</b> <b>height,</b> and thickness) to investigate experimentally the effects of different product parameters on the quality of Chain-die-formed U-profile AHSS products. Experimental verification on a new group of experimental samples using the established mathematical expressions is also performed successfully. This study shows that response surface methodology with Box-Behnken design can be efficiently applied for evaluating and predicting the MELMS and springback of Chain-die-formed AHSS products. It is found that the most influential parameter which determines the severity of the MELMS is the linear effect of <b>flange</b> <b>height.</b> This study also indicates that the springback is largely determined by the linear effect of tensile strength. The findings are expected to help designers and researchers to identify the formability range and predict the quality of Chain-die-formed AHSS products in advance of the quality control and fabrication stages...|$|R
40|$|To {{prevent the}} {{occurrence}} of wrinkling in the shrink flanging of ultra-high strength steel sheets, a gradually contacting punch was developed. Compressive stress around the convex corner of the sheet in shrink flanging was reduced by gradually bending the edge from the center {{to the outside of}} the sheet using the gradually contacting punch. Compressive strain around the convex corner edge decreased as the contact angle of the punch increased. Although a small camber occurred on the upper surface of the flanged sheet using the conventional flat bottom punch, the camber was large using the gradually contacting punch because of the gradual bending. The limiting <b>flange</b> <b>height</b> of the flanged sheet without wrinkling showed an increase of 26 % for the 980 MPa grade ultra-high strength steel sheet...|$|R
40|$|Current {{maintenance}} criteria of railway wheel geometries consider mainly <b>flange</b> thickness, <b>flange</b> <b>height,</b> <b>flange</b> gradient, {{and depth of}} tread wear. These geometrical quantities are relatively simple to evaluate, but do not fully describe neither the worn profile nor its influence on subsequent deterioration of wheel and rail. With increased use of automatic wheel profile measurements {{there is a potential}} to plan maintenance from measures that provide a more elaborate description of the wheel profile and its operational capabilities. To this end, the paper first outlines a procedure to parametrise worn wheel profiles. This procedure is linked to multibody simulations of a curve negotiating freight wagon to identify parameters of the worn wheel profile with the largest influence on rolling contact fatigue (RCF) and wear. To limit the number of parameter combinations, nearly orthogonal and space filling Latin hypercube sampling is employed. Regression analysis is then utilised to derive simple relationships (meta-models) between geometry parameters and deterioration measures. The derived meta-models of RCF and wear deterioration are shown to produce good agreement to results from fully fledged multibody simulations. The end result is identified geometrical quantities that provide an improved categorisation of the deteriorated wheel tread geometry for improved maintenance decisions...|$|R

It was found that a <b>minimum</b> <b>flange</b> of 2 wavelengths in the directions perpendicular to the broad dimension of the waveguide is required to insure agreement of the conductance to within 2 $ and the susceptance to within 5 $ of the calculated values. It was found that in the direction perpendicular to the narrow dimension of the waveguide, a flange of total width of 0. 9 x was still large enough to insure this same agreement, even though the aperture width was slightly over 0. 8 x.

40|$|Self-piercing {{riveting}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} joining methods for construction of aluminium body structures in the automotive industry. In order to optimise vehicle mass it is desirable to use <b>minimum</b> <b>flange</b> widths, which has implications with respect to the rivet to sheet edge distance and consequently joint quality and strength. The influence of the rivet to sheet edge distance, referred as edge distance, on the quality and strength of self-piercing riveted joints was evaluated using standard aluminium alloy AA 5754 through two groups of samples. For Group 1; the edge distance changed by varying rivet pitch, whilst the samples’ width was kept constant. For Group 2; the different edge distances were obtained by changing sample width, whilst the rivet pitch remained the same. The results showed that the edge distance affects joint quality by altering distortion levels and tearing resistance. The increase in edge distance led to an increase in both lap-shear and coach-peel strength; whilst rivet pitch and specimen width play a minor role in the strength trend. An optimum edge distance and a minimum edge distance with considerations on joint quality and strength are recommended...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} shows a {{development}} {{and analysis of}} 2 -D axisymmetric CFD model of flanged diffuser that {{was used as a}} casing for developed small wind turbines to increase the generated power. The 2 -D CFD diffuser model grids are developed by GAMBIT, while the flow field analysis has been carried out using commercial software FLUENT. This study focuses on the effect of flange’s angles as a varied parameter on velocity at diffuser entrance. All models have the same dimensions in diffuser length, entrance diameter, exit diameter and <b>flange</b> <b>height</b> but differ in flange angle. Flange angles of these tested models vary from − 25 ° to + 25 °, where flange angles were measured to vertical axis. Present model verification indicates a good agreement between present numerical work and previous published experimental work. The numerical simulation shows the created vortices behind flange that cause pressure drop which increases mass flow rate through the diffuser. The results indicate also that the right flange angle at 15 ° is the optimum angle that accelerates flow at diffuser entrance. The increase of velocity at this optimum flange angles is higher than the case of normal angle, where the expected increase in the generated power by wind turbine can reach 5 % more compared with normal flange...|$|R

MATERIAL AND METHODS CT- or DVT-scans of 43 patients (mean age 62 ± 8 years) with an edentulous maxilla were analyzed with the NobelGuide software.

Anatomical and prosthetic landmarks, including the cervical crown point (C-Point), the acrylic flange border (F-Point), and the implant-platform buccal-end (I-Point) were defined in each middle section to determine four measuring parameters: (1) acrylic <b>flange</b> <b>height</b> (FLHeight), (2) mucosal coverage (MucCov), (3) crown-Implant distance (CID) and (4) buccal prosthesis profile (ProsthProfile).

40|$|The railway is an {{important}} mode of transport, due to its environmental friendliness, high safety level, and low energy consumption, among other reasons. Railways provide a sustainable means of transporting {{a large amount of}} freight and passengers, in a cost-effective and comfortable way. The railway system has a large number of stakeholders and a small improvement in the system will give many advantages, including financial savings and an increase in the quality of service. The Swedish railway network is old and there has been almost no expansion of the network during the past few decades. There is currently a demand for more track capacity and there are no more tracks availably at the network; therefore, the existing network is expected to deliver more capacity. The railway operators are the largest cause of train delays and wheel failures are one major contributor of the delays caused by operators. The infrastructure manager is the second largest owner of train delays, and a large contributor of their train delays is switches and crossings (S&Cs). This thesis shows proposals for how condition monitoring technology can be used more efficiently for both the infrastructure and the rolling stock to increase the reliability of their critical items by decreasing train delay. Firstly, the condition of the wheel-rail interface is important, in that a bad wheel influences the rail and vice versa. The monitoring of rail profiles is already in use, but the monitoring of wheel profiles is still in the development phase. This thesis shows the performance of a wheel profile measurement system (WPMS) for an extreme climate, and a case study of performance measures such as the accuracy and reliability of the system is presented. An additional topic dealt with is how the information from the WPMS can be combined with that from the wheel defect detectors to find early indications of wheels with bad behaviour. Secondly, the S&C is an essential component of a railway system in that it increases the flexibility by diverting traffic, but S&Cs need adequate support to work properly. A camera-monitoring method for S&Cs is presented which increases the inspection frequency and decreases the human activities on the track and the train delay. In conclusion, this thesis shows that the WPMS investigated works well {{with a high level of}} performance concerning measurement accuracy and reliability in an extreme climate, and that there is still some potential for improving the system. The combination of the WPMS and wheel defect detectors shows that wheels with a high <b>flange</b> <b>height</b> have a higher probability of ending up as wheels suffering from failures. A new maintenance limit for the <b>flange</b> <b>height</b> can reduce the number of wheel defects on the track. Camera-monitoring of the S&C will increase the availability and reliability of this item and even reduce the time on the track required for the maintenance action “check” through fewer inspections and maintenance actions. These proposed monitoring techniques can improve the railway system reliability by reducing the consequential train delay times, by decreasing the number of failures of wheels and S&Cs.

40|$|AbstractShrouding (diffuser augmented) {{horizontal}} axis micro-wind turbine {{has been shown}} to be an effective way to potentially improve the performance of micro wind turbine for applications in built environments. It is well understood that the degree of the performance enhancement depends on several factors including the diffuser shape and geometries, blade airfoils, and the wind condition at the mounting site. The effect of diffuser shape and geometries is reported in this paper. Performance of diffuser with three different geometrical features namely: straight diffuser, nozzle-diffuser combination, and diffuser-brim (brimmed diffuser) combination have been investigated. This paper aims to compare the performance of bare and diffuser augmented turbine; and investigate the effect of the diffuser geometrical parameters: diffuser lengths (L/D= 0. 63 to 1. 5) and <b>flange</b> <b>heights</b> (H/D= 0 to 0. 2). Tests confirmed that placing the micro turbine model inside a shroud can substantially improve its performance. The diffuser only shroud improves the performance by 60 % compared to the bare turbine and the nozzle-diffuser enhancement of 63 % is slightly better than diffuser only. The improvement with brimmed diffuser also shows substantial performance enhancement. Increasing the diffuser length (L/D) does not affect the optimum Cp of the wind turbine but shifts the performance curve and the optimum Cp to higher tip-speed-ratio, λ. But adding brim (flange) at the exit plane of the diffuser increase the performance, Cp as well as reduce the cut in speed and shift optimum λ to higher value. The finding from this work demonstrates that shrouding micro wind turbine not only improves its performance but also points out how diffuser geometrical features (L/D) and/or (H/D) can be used to design a turbine with performance curve to suit the location...|$|R

The structural attributes considered include various general conditions encountered in practical metal building design: unequal brace spacing, unequal brace stiffness, nonprismatic member geometry, variable axial load or bending moment along the member length, cross-section double or single symmetry, combined bending and axial load, combined torsional and lateral bracing from girts/purlins with or without diagonal braces from these components to the inside <b>flanges,</b> load <b>height,</b> cross-section distortion, and non-rigid end boundary conditions.

40|$|The railway is an {{important}} mode of transport, due to its environmental friendliness, high safety level, and low energy consumption combined with a high transport capacity, among other factors. The Swedish railway network is old, there has been almost no expansion of the network {{during the past few}} decades, and more traffic is expected. Therefore, there is currently a demand for more track capacity and, in the short term, the existing network is expected to deliver the increased capacity. The railway operators in the network have a large impact on train delays, and wheel failures are one large contributor of delays. Delays destroy capacity and, therefore, capacityconsuming failures, such as abnormal wheels, need to be minimised. This can be achieved by using appropriate condition monitoring for the wheels on the track to find potential capacity consumers before failures happen. Therefore, the condition of the wheel-rail interface is important, since the state of the wheel influences that of the rail and vice versa. The monitoring of rail profiles is already being performed, but the monitoring of wheel profiles is still in the development phase. This thesis treats the applications and performance assessment of a wheel profile measurement system (WPMS), and presents case studies focusing on its system and measurement performance. The proposed applications concern how the information from the WPMS can be integrated with information from other data sources and with physical models to obtain a true current picture of the wheel behaviour. The thesis investigates the measurement performance of the WPMS by using a paired T-test and a number of quality measures, e. g. the reproducibility and repeatability, the precision-to-tolerance ratio and the signal-to-noise ratio. In conclusion, this thesis shows that the WPMS works well with an expected level of reliability in a harsh climate with respect to its measurement and system performance. By combining other data with the data from the WPMS, potentially abnormal wheels can be found in an early stage if the proposed new maintenance limit for the wheel parameter of the <b>flange</b> <b>height</b> is implemented. Furthermore, through adding a physical model to the process, the real contact condition of the actual wheel-rail interface can be evaluated and measurement deviations can be found. However, the wheel parameters, as well as the entire profile, need a high measurement quality with little variation, which seems to be an issue with respect to the measurement performance when advanced calculations are to be done. Therefore, a new approach for evaluating measurement performance has been developed using established statistical tools and quality measures with predefined acceptance limits; with the help of this approach, one can differentiate between the variation in the measurements originating in the different measurement units and the variation originating in the wheels. This new approach can be applied to judge the measurement performance of wheel profile condition-monitoring systems, and can also be implemented for other condition-monitoring systems to evaluate their measurement performance. Finally, this approach promotes the development of a condition-based maintenance policy by providing more reliable information for maintenance decision makers...|$|R

A qualitative ana 1 ysis was made of the fatigue behavior of individual thin web girder panels with initial lateral web deflections.

To support {{the axial force}} on the flanged section of the die, some corresponding support is needed on {{the interior of the}} ring as well. Going ahead with a consolidated research line, stress and strain states of shelf (or “shouldered”) dies, with fixed filling height, have been numerically analyzed by FEM. After previous study of two-diameter shrink-fitting surface, connected by a transversal ring, the effects of a conical shrink-fitting surface have been investigated. Also in this case, to assess stress distribution and strain pattern, on the nucleus and on the ring, no analytical calculation method is available, whereas the usual empirical approach sometimes leads to disappointing and expensive operating failures. The shelf geometry depends on part shape and compression ratio on the inner of the nucleus, but may be variable on the common surface nucleus/ring.

40|$|A recent {{trend in}} bridge {{construction}} {{has been the}} optimization of the cost-to-performance ratio. The {{most effective way to}} optimize the cost-to-performance ratio is to maximize the efficiency of the superstructure. Currently, many bridge engineers and designers favor two- or three- girder plate superstructures, due to their cost advantages. However, research on the performance enhancements of the I-type girder in two- or three- girder plate bridges is lacking. One of the most important performance improvement technologies for the I-type girder is the “preflex” method. In the preflex method, the specimen is inverted during the construction process to apply prestressed cambering to the specimen by using self-weight. However, a problem with the preflex construction method is difficulty with inverting the girder/plate system during the concrete curing process. Therefore, a new inverting system called Turn-Over (TO) wheel was proposed. Using TO wheels, wider variations to the I-type girder design can be achieved. Using this TO construction method, various cross sectional designs of girder plate systems can be considered due to its easiness in inverting the girder/plate system. In this study, the location of concrete confinement sections between the steel I-beams and concrete plates was varied in an I-girder cross-sectional design. Design parameters included effective <b>height,</b> <b>flange</b> thickness, flange width, confining concrete section width, etc. From this study, the optimum cross-sectional design of the I-girder/concrete plate system was achieved. Then, a single 20 m TO girder/plate system and two 20 m TO girder bridges were constructed and tested to evaluate their performance. From the test, failure behavior, load carrying capacity, crack pattern, etc., are obtained. The results are discussed in detail in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Structural steel design {{standards}} recognize lateral torsional buckling {{as a failure}} mode governing the capacity of long span unsupported beams with wide flange cross-sections. Standard solutions start with the closed form solution of the Vlasov thin-walled beam theory for {{the case of a}} simply supported beam under uniform moments, and modify the solution to accommodate various moment distributions through moment gradient expressions. The Vlasov theory solution {{is based on the assumption}} that cross-sectional distortional effects have a negligible effect on the predicted elastic critical moment. The present study systematically examines the validity of the Vlasov assumption related to cross-section distortion through a parametric study. A series of elastic shell finite element eigen-value buckling analyses is conducted on simply supported beams subject to uniform moments, linear moments and mid span point loads as well as cantilevers subject to top flange loading acting at the tip. Cross-sectional dimensions are selected to represent structural steel cross-section geometries used in practice. Particular attention is paid to model end connection details commonly used in practice involving moment connections with two pairs of stiffeners, simply supported ends with a pair of transverse stiffeners, simply supported ends with cleat angle details, and built in fixation at cantilever roots. The critical moments obtained from the FEA are compared to those based on conventional critical moment equations in various Standards and published solutions. The effects of web slenderness, <b>flange</b> slenderness, web <b>height</b> to <b>flange</b> width ratio, and span to height ratios on the critical moment ratio are systematically quantified.
