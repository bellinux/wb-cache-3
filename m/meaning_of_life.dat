5|$|The abrupt {{cutting off}} of God's voice before he reveals the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> was {{intended}} to be cut off by a voiceover promotion for whatever Fox program aired after The Simpsons. However, Fox did not pick up on this and so God's voice was instead cut off by the show's credits.|$|E
5|$|Creationists {{argue against}} {{evolution}} {{on the grounds}} that it cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as abiogenesis, the Big Bang, or the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> In such instances, evolution is being redefined to refer to the entire history of the universe, and it is argued that if one aspect of the universe is seemingly inexplicable, the entire body of scientific theories must be baseless. At this point, objections leave the arena of evolutionary biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{outcomes of}} a quantitative psychotechnological {{research on the}} process of one's comprehension <b>of</b> his/her own <b>life.</b> It focuses on the reflective mechanisms <b>of</b> realizing <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> thus further developing research on <b>meaning</b> formations <b>of</b> personality within the culturalactivity approach. For these purposes a method of solving the task <b>of</b> finding the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> a dream was used in the study, which is in fact an operationalization of the method of productive amplification of consciousness. Rather than examining the already formed contents <b>of</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> available for introspective descriptions, this method allows the exploration of the constructive activity of consciousness through which these <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> are formed. The main outcome is the reconstruction and empirical model of reflective activity carried out by the individual in the process <b>of</b> comprehending <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and his/her life situatio...|$|R

5|$|Marge, Reverend Lovejoy and Ned attempt {{without success}} to bring Homer {{back to the}} congregation. One Sunday morning, while {{everybody}} else is at church, Homer falls {{asleep on the couch}} smoking a cigar, which ignites some magazines and ultimately sets the whole house ablaze. Homer wakes up but quickly succumbs to the thick smoke and faints. Apu, chief of Springfield's volunteer fire department, rushes to the Simpson house with other firefighters including Krusty the Clown, Chief Wiggum, and Barney. Meanwhile, Ned runs into the burning house to rescue Homer and pulls him out just as the firefighters arrive. After the fire is out, Homer declares that God was delivering vengeance. Reverend Lovejoy counters that God was working through the hearts of Homer's friends, despite their different faiths. Homer agrees to give church another try and the next Sunday is there, albeit snoring loudly through the service. Appearing in his dreams again, God consoles Homer on the failure of his religion. He starts to tell Homer the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> but is cut off by the ending credits.|$|E

40|$|National audienceQuality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> nursing {{caregivers}} {{who work}} in the ICU {{has been the focus of}} several studies in recent decades. This study aimed to identify the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> given by nursing caregivers working in ICUs for adults. This was a descriptive exploratory study with a qualitative approach. There were five central themes that gave direction to the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> quality of life: QOL as biopsychosociospiritual welfare; time for family and social life; QOL related to leisure; professional achievement as a source of QOL; and financial stability. The findings suggest that the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is subjective, because it depends on the importance of the factors that nursing caregivers attaches to their life, such as those related to personal needs, resources and training materials for their job performance and professional achievement, as well as being valued by means of economic stability...|$|R
