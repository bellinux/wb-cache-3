5|$|The British fleet was {{anchored}} off The Rock on 10December 1796 when a storm blew up. Culloden {{was obliged}} {{to get under way}} when her anchors failed to hold, narrowly missing Pearl Rock in the process, and at 21:00, Gibraltar was forced to cut her cable. As she was attempting to get clear of Cabrita Point at 22:00, her fore topmast snapped and her foresail, mainsail, main topmast staysail, and <b>mizzen</b> <b>staysail</b> tore. Having already lost her main topsail, she became difficult to handle and struck the sandbank several times before being blown across it. By midnight Gibraltar was out of danger and able to ride out the storm, and the next day at noon she anchored in Tangier Bay. The damage incurred during the storm necessitated her being sent to Plymouth in January 1797. During the repairs, which took until April and cost £12,818, a large piece of rock was removed from her hull. Gibraltar returned to the Mediterranean in July 1797 under Captain William Hancock Kelly.|$|E
2500|$|She was rigged as a barque (the fore- and mainmasts being square rig and the {{mizzen mast}} {{carrying}} a fore-aft sail) {{and the total}} maximum sail area was 12,296 square feet (1142 square metres). Following {{the practice of the}} most modern sailing ships of the time, the windjammers, she carried split topsails {{to reduce the size of}} the deck crew needed to handle them. The ship was rigged to carry several large staysails and the funnel was hinged at the base so it could be laid on the deck when the large <b>mizzen</b> <b>staysail</b> was rigged once at sea. The Discovery was marginally faster under sail than she was under engine - her record for distance travelled in 24 hours is 223 nautical miles (358km), equivalent to 9.2 knots (10.5mph, 17km/h)> ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, I will tell; {{but first}} let’s taste the grog. Hem! it’s {{the right kind}} of stuff, I must say, that you keep in this country; but then you’re so close aboard the West Indies, you make but a small run of it. By the Lord Harry, woman, if Garnsey only lay somewhere between Cape Hatteras and the bite of Logann, but you’d see rum cheap! As to the seas, they runs more in uppers in the Bay of Biscay, unless it may be in a sow-wester, when they tumble about quite handsomely; thof it’s not in the narrow sea that you are to look for a swell; just go off the Western Islands, in a {{westerly}} blow, keeping the land on your larboard hand, with the ship’s head to the south’ard, and bring to, under a close-reefed topsail; or, mayhap, a reefed foresail, with a fore-topmast-staysail and <b>mizzen</b> <b>staysail</b> to keep her up to the sea, if she will bear it; and ay there for the matter of two watches, {{if you want to see}} mountains. Why, good woman, I’ve been off there in the Boadishey frigate, when you could see nothing but some such matter as a piece of sky, mayhap, as big as the main sail; and then again, there was a hole under your lee-quarter big enough to hold the whole British navy.” ...|$|E
50|$|On large rigs, staysails {{other than}} {{headsails}} are named {{according to the}} mast and mast section on which they are hoisted. Thus, the staysail hoisted on a stay that runs forward and downwards {{from the top of}} the mizzen topgallant mast is the <b>mizzen</b> topgallant <b>staysail.</b> If two staysails are hoisted to different points on this mast, they would be the <b>mizzen</b> upper topgallant <b>staysail</b> and the <b>mizzen</b> lower topgallant <b>staysail.</b>|$|R
50|$|The staysails {{between the}} masts are named from the sail {{immediately}} below the highest attachment {{point of the}} stay holding up the <b>staysail.</b> Thus, the <b>mizzen</b> topgallant <b>staysail</b> can be found dangling from the stay leading from above the mizzen (third) mast's topgallant sail to some place (usually two sails down) on the second (main) mast.|$|R
50|$|Staysails may {{be carried}} between any other mast {{and the one}} {{in front of it}} or from the {{foremast}} to the bowsprit. They are named after the mast from which they are hoisted, so for example a staysail hoisted {{to the top of the}} mizzen topgallant on a stay running to the top of the main topmast would be called the <b>mizzen</b> topgallant <b>staysail.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s and 1960s {{ocean racing}} yawls were {{developed}} {{to take advantage of}} a handicapping rule that did not penalize them for flying a <b>mizzen</b> <b>staysail,</b> which on long ocean races, often downwind, were a great advantage. A good example of this was Olin Stephens' Finisterre.|$|E
5000|$|Originally {{built in}} 1912, the former Admiralty steam pinnace was bought in 1929 for £40 (equivalent to £ today) by Charles and Sylvia Lightoller. The hull was {{recovered}} from the mud at Conyer Creek east of the River Medway and was fitted with two masts and ketch-rigged with jib, mainsail, mizzen and <b>mizzen</b> <b>staysail.</b> Because Sylvia was Australian, they named their converted yacht Sundowner, an Australian term for a tramp or hobo. Originally 52 feet long, she was extended to 58 feet, and fitted with [...] Parsons petrol-paraffin 4-stroke engine driving a single propeller, giving her {{a top speed of}} 8 kn.|$|E

50|$|The Thistle {{seems to}} have no longer had her main topmast by 1919, as the {{mainmast}} was demoted to become the mizzen, and the ship adopted what was effectively a ketch sailplan, with a jib in the bows, a tall square-rigged foremast carrying a mainsail and topsail, and two fore-and-aft sails on the shorter <b>mizzen,</b> a <b>staysail</b> and a trysail spanker. Subsequently, she adopted a reduced rig of just three sails - her jib, one square sail on the foremast, and a single fore-and-aft sail on the mizzen.|$|R
5000|$|It is in {{this book}} that the drawing of a sailing ship of this era {{is added to the}} print copies. [...] "Far more {{confusing}} to newcomers may be some of the nautical and scientific dialogue the characters exchange. O'Brian's publishers have equipped the book with a drawing of the Surprise, numbering 21 sails, from the flying jib to the <b>mizzen</b> topgallant <b>staysail.</b> But that hardly prepares the unwary for Captain Aubrey and his crew's discussions of recondite items like cross-catharpins, dumb-chalders, side-trees, heel-pieces, side-fishes, cheeks, front-fish and cant-pieces." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{northern}} Europe {{and among}} long distance cruisers, the ketch is often preferred to a sloop, since the additional sail allows a better balance, {{and a smaller}} more easily handled mainsail. An advantage of the ketch is when sudden increases in wind strength require a rapid reefing: the mainsail can be dropped, reducing sail and leaving a balanced sail-plan with jib and mizzen set. The ketch rig also allows sailing only on the mizzen and jib, without introducing excessive lee helm, and in an emergency can be quite well steered without use of the rudder. When running before the wind or reaching across the wind, a ketch may set extra sails such as a spinnaker on the main mast, and a spinnaker or <b>mizzen</b> <b>staysail</b> on the mizzen mast. Another advantage of a ketch is at anchor, where the mizzen sail {{may be used to}} hold the boat steady in the wind; this reduces roll in an otherwise uncomfortable anchorage.|$|E
