500|$|With a {{past as a}} musician, I {{remember}} sometimes {{feeling like}} the audience was against <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> on stage [...] Even if that wasn't noticeable in any way, I still {{felt as if they}} all disliked me, or at least, misunderstood me, deep inside. That paranoia was kind of firmly rooted inside of me—the fear of being the wrong artist in front of the wrong audience. Thus, the idea for 'She's Madonna' deals with that.|$|E
2500|$|From 7 July, {{sessions}} ran intermittently {{through to}} late August. Shankar later told Rolling Stone magazine {{that he wrote}} [...] "Mangalam" [...] at this time: [...] "'Mangalam' came to <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> walking in Friar Park, George's place, where we were recording. I {{was looking at the}} trees and the sky, and feeling very elated all of a sudden, wishing everything should be good for everyone, and it just came to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{with the}} onset of the Great Depression, the {{painting}} came {{to be seen as a}} depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit. Wood assisted this transition by renouncing his Bohemian youth in Paris and grouping himself with populist Midwestern painters, such as John Steuart Curry and Thomas Hart Benton, who revolted against the dominance of East Coast art circles. Wood was quoted in this period as stating, [...] "All the good ideas I've ever had came to <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> milking a cow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Lady Constantine, don't {{be angry}} with me! Will you do this,--watch the star for <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> gone? If you are {{prepared}} to do it effectually, I will go.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{struggled}} against {{him as she}} answered: [...] "I don't know--Yes, I do know--it ain't right for me--for you to say these things to <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> Mart Haney's wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah;--that I do not know. But you <b>are</b> harsh to <b>me,</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{longing to}} be kind to you. Can you not see {{that this has been}} all forced upon me,--partly by yourself?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Frank Tyson met {{his wife}} Ursula Miels (born in 1936) in Melbourne on the 1954–55 tour, and they married in a Melbourne church on 22 November 1957 with much publicity. They had three children, Philip (a non-Typhoon medium paced bowler), Sara and Anna, and eight grandchildren. He retired from first class cricket in 1960 and emigrated to Australia as a ten pound pom, as his hero Harold Larwood had done ten years earlier. [...] "It had struck <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> over there {{that it was a}} {{wonderful}} country to bring up a family, with the open spaces, the climate and the job opportunities". He became a schoolmaster at Carey Baptist Grammar School in Melbourne, teaching English, French and History, later becoming a housemaster and the head of languages.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{his victory}} over Molina, Khan {{returned}} to the UK, for a fight against 33 year old Julio Díaz (40-7-1, 29 KOs) on 27 April 2013 in a 143lbs 'catch-weight' bout. The fight {{took place at the}} Motorpoint Arena in Sheffield. Khan was able to control some of the fight and managed to survive a fourth-round knockdown from Diaz. Khan managed to hold on throughout the fight to go onto win the fight by a fairly close unanimous decision. The scorecards; Phil Edwards 114–113 – Steve Gray 115–113 – Terry O'Connor 115–112. In the aftermath, Khan praised Díaz, He caught <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> off balance, and I couldn't get my stance back. I went down. I kept moving to recompose myself. That's what happens. There are little things to work on when we go back in the gym." [...] Khan stated the fight could be his last in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|At the D8 conference {{hosted by}} [...] on June 2, 2010, host Kara Swisher told Zuckerberg {{she knew he}} was not happy with The Social Network being based on him, to which he replied, [...] "I just wished that nobody made a movie of <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> still alive." [...] Zuckerberg stated to Oprah Winfrey that the drama and partying of the film is mostly fiction, {{explaining}} [...] "this is my life, so I know it's not so dramatic," [...] and that he spent most of the past six years focusing, working hard, and coding Facebook. Speaking to an audience at Stanford University, Zuckerberg stated that the film portrayed his motivations for creating Facebook inaccurately; instead of an effort to [...] "get girls", he says he created the site because he enjoys [...] "building things". However, he added that the film accurately depicted his real-life wardrobe, saying, [...] "It's interesting the stuff that they focused on getting right – like every single shirt and fleece they had in that movie is actually a shirt or fleece that I own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{got it in}} New Dublin," [...] I replied, [...] "and I want it {{to amuse}} and occupy <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> at home. <b>I</b> haven't {{anything}} else to do, except things that take me away from you." ...|$|R
5000|$|He imbibed the {{universal}} religion. He saw God and went beyond, {{that is how}} he could say [...] "I do not repeat the name of god, nor do I prayer, but God is does all this in <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> at peace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, do paint <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> asleep," [...] said Gertrude to Felix, smiling. And {{she closed}} her eyes a little. It had by this time become a matter of almost {{exciting}} anxiety to Charlotte what Gertrude would say or would do next.|$|R
2500|$|... 21 April, Faisal {{left for}} the East. Before he left, on 17 April Clemenceau sent a draft letter, in which the French {{government}} declared that they recognized [...] "the right of Syria to independence {{in the form of}} a federation of autonomous governments in agreement with the traditions and wishes of the populations", and claimed that Faisal had recognized [...] "that France is the Power qualified to render Syria the assistance of various advisors necessary to introduce order and realise the progress demanded by the Syrian populations" [...] and on 20 April, Faisal assured Clemenceau that he had been [...] "Deeply impressed by the disinterested friendliness of your statements to <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in Paris, and must thank you for having been the first to suggest the dispatch of the inter-allied Commission, which is to leave shortly for the East to ascertain the wishes of the local peoples as to the future organisation of their country. I am sure that the people of Syria will know how to show you their gratitude." ...|$|E
2500|$|A movie {{based on}} Zuckerberg and the {{founding}} years of Facebook, The Social Network {{was released on}} October 1, 2010, and stars Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg. After Zuckerberg was told about the film, he responded, [...] "I just wished that nobody made a movie of <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> still alive." [...] Also, after the film's script was leaked on the Internet and {{it was apparent that}} the film would not portray Zuckerberg in a wholly positive light, he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a [...] "good guy". The film is based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich, which the book's publicist once described as [...] "big juicy fun" [...] rather than [...] "reportage". The film's screenwriter Aaron Sorkin told New York magazine, [...] "I don't want my fidelity to be the truth; I want it to be storytelling", adding, [...] "What is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy's sake, and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good?" ...|$|E
60|$|No person {{came to my}} room, {{and nothing}} {{happened}} to interrupt <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> reading Mr. Philip Dunboyne's letters.|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph," [...] said Aunt Cynthia. [...] "Well, I won't entice {{you into}} telling any more fibs. And I didn't drive out here to-day {{in all this}} wind to talk sense into you {{concerning}} Max. I'm going to Halifax for two months and I {{want you to take}} charge of Fatima for <b>me,</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> away." ...|$|R
5000|$|Living {{funerals}} {{can also}} be seen as egocentric because the person having the funeral might use it as an opportunity to brag, since listing accomplishments during one's life is often a popular thing to do during this ceremony. However, Mizunoe Takiko, who had a living funeral on television, said that the purpose of her funeral was “to express appreciation to all those who have <b>been</b> dear to <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> still alive.” ...|$|R
60|$|I {{hope that}} no society will <b>be</b> named for <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> still alive, for I might {{at some time}} or other do {{something}} which would cause its members to regret having done me that honor. After I shall have joined the dead I shall follow the customs of those people and be guilty of no conduct that can wound any friend; but until that time shall come <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> a doubtful quantity {{like the rest of}} our race.|$|R
60|$|Watching her opportunity, Fanny Mere came to <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> alone, {{carrying}} a thick letter in her hand. She held it before {{me with the}} address uppermost.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I was {{thinking}} what a pity {{it was you}} did not tell <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> still on land, and then I would have brought my heart with me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't black up!" [...] roared William Philander. [...] "It's all a horrid joke {{somebody}} has played on <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> asleep! You don't want me, do you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Gons. I cannot go 'till I behold you happy:-- --Here, Rodorick, receive her on thy knees; Use {{her with}} that respect, which thou would'st pay Thy {{guardian}} angel, {{if he could}} be seen. --Do not provoke my anger by refusing.-- I'll watch thy least offence to her; each word, Nay, every sullen look;-- And, as the devils, who are damned to torments, Yet have the guilty souls their slaves to punish; So, under <b>me,</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> wretched, thou Shalt be tormented.-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Haven't I {{already told}} you that I have thought of every thing? When I get to London I shall apply to some of my mother's old friends--friends of hers in the {{time when she was}} a musician. Every body tells me I have a voice--if I had only {{cultivated}} it. I will cultivate it! I can live, and live respectably, as a concert singer. I have saved money enough to support <b>me,</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> learning--and my mother's friends will help me, for her sake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, let's {{get through}} with it," [...] he said. [...] "God bless you, my little boy! you have saved {{a man from}} {{committing}} a crime this night. Bessie shall pray for {{you as soon as}} I get home and give her her orders. I shall never burglarize another house--at least not until the June magazines are out. It'll be your little sister's turn then to run in on <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> abstracting the U. S. 4 per cent. from the tea urn and buy me off with her coral necklace and a falsetto kiss." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I right," [...] I began, [...] "in supposing {{that you}} dreamed {{of me in}} Shetland, as you once before dreamed of <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at my house in Perthshire?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{knew the}} poor lad {{was to be}} maimed in some manner. The same {{blinding}} rush of rage which had come upon <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the cabin, overpowered all sense of danger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Country styles," [...] {{returned}} Cissy, with a supercilious air. [...] "No! Besides, Markham's {{head clerk}} is gettin' too presumptuous. Just guess! He asked <b>me,</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> buyin' something, if I enjoyed the dance last Monday!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} you must not draw away from me. I shall want to feel that you are quite close to <b>me.</b> Mamma, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at Allington, Major Grantly came there." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{might be}} {{thought that this}} was a poor way to {{accumulate}} a princely fortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> one of those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge <b>me,</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have <b>been</b> surprised had <b>I</b> <b>been</b> offered the 200th, considering <b>I</b> <b>was</b> of a broad-shouldered make.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{all these}} are {{replaced}} by Caxton with a final colophon reading: [...] "I pray you all gentlemen and gentlewomen that readeth this book of Arthur and his knights, {{from the beginning to}} the ending, pray for <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> alive, that God send me good deliverance and when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> dead, <b>I</b> pray you all pray for my soul. For this book was ended the ninth year of the reign of King Edward the Fourth by Sir Thomas Maleore, knight, as Jesu help him for his great might, as he is the servant of Jesu both day and night." ...|$|R
60|$|An idiot hope {{struck me}} that they might think {{something}} had insulted <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> writing the cheque and that I had changed my mind. I made a wretched attempt {{to look like a}} man with a fearfully quick temper.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{they came}} up here to hunt, I hope {{they are not going}} to settle down {{anywhere}} near Cedar Lodge," [...] remarked Gif. [...] "I'd hate to have those fellows saddled on <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to have some fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{was nothing}} left to suggest. Young and inexperienced as she was, how (I asked) had she {{contrived}} to think of all this? She answered, simply [...] "I'm sure I don't know; my thoughts came to <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> looking at Philip." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What could a man gain by {{stealing}} a girl? If it was Mr. Mershone, does he imagine I could ever forget Arthur? Or cease to love him? Or that Arthur would forget <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> away? Perhaps it's Diana, {{and she wants}} to get rid of me so she can coax Arthur back to her side. But that's nonsense; isn't it, Madame Cerise? No girl--not even Diana Von Taer--would dare to act in such a high-handed manner toward her rival. Did you ever hear of Miss Von Taer? She's quite a society belle. Have you ever seen her, Madame Cerise?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to <b>be</b> near <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{speaking}} to Horace," [...] she said. [...] "It will give me courage if I can feel that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> speaking {{to you as well}} as to him. I can count on your sympathy--and sympathy is so precious to me now! Am I asking too much, if I ask you to leave the door unclosed when {{you go back to the}} dining-room? Think of the dreadful trial--to him as well as to me! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> only a woman; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid <b>I</b> may sink under it, if I have no friend near me. And I have no friend but you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It afflicted me {{a little}} that the King still has doubts of <b>me,</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> obeying in such a matter, {{diametrically}} opposite to my own ideas. In what way shall I offer stronger proofs? I may give myself to the Devil, {{it will be to}} no purpose; nothing but the old song over again, doubt on doubt.--Don't imagine <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to disoblige the Duke, the Duchess or the Daughter, I beseech you! I know too well what is due to them, and too much respect their merits, not to observe the strictest rules of what <b>is</b> proper,--even if <b>I</b> hated their progeny and them like the pestilence.|$|R
