40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{microbial}} pathogens and herbivores elicit defence responses in plants. Moreover, microorganisms associated with herbivores, such as bacteria or viruses, can modulate the plant’s response to herbivores. Herbivorous spider mites can harbour different species of bacterial symbionts and exert a broad range of effects on host-plant defences. Hence, we tested the extent to which such symbionts affect the plant’s defences induced by their mite host and assessed if this translates into changes in plant resistance. We assessed the bacterial communities of two strains of the common <b>mite</b> <b>pest</b> Tetranychus urticae. We found that these strains harboured distinct symbiotic bacteria and removed these using antibiotics. Subsequently, we tested to which extent mites with and without symbiotic bacteria induce plant defences in terms of phytohormone accumulation and defence gene expression, and assessed mite oviposition and survival as a measure for plant resistance. We observed that the absence/presence of these bacteria altered distinct plant defence parameters and affected mite performance but we did not find indications for a causal link between the two. We argue that although bacteria-related effects on host-induced plant defences may occur, these do not necessarily affect plant resistance concomitantly...|$|E
40|$|Coconut, an {{important}} plantation crop, is currently facing {{a serious threat}} from a newly reported <b>mite</b> <b>pest,</b> Aceria guerreronis, which was so far not known to exist in India. This mite which is microscopic, completes its life cycle hiding beneath the perianth of the coconut fruit.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{old world}} date mite, Oligonychus afrasiaticus (McGregor) (Acari: Tetranychidae) is a severe spider <b>mite</b> <b>pest</b> of date palm {{in most of}} the Middle East and North Africa. Considering that nothing is known about the {{performance}} of phytoseiid predators against O. afrasiaticus, biology, predation, and life table parameters of Cydnoseius negevi (Swirski and Amitai) and Neoseiulus barkeri Hughes (Acari: Phytoseiidae), collected from date palm orchards, were studied under laboratory conditions (25, 35 C and 356 10 % RH) as a first step to understand their effectiveness against all mobile life stages of O. afrasiaticus. For both predators, oviposition pe-riod was significantly shorter at 35 C than at 25 C. The following parameters were obtained for C. negevi and N. barkeri at 25 and 35 C, respectively: female longevity, 31. 8, 20. 1, 35. 7, 27. 4 d; fecundity, 21. 6, 38. 0, 18. 8, 34. 8 eggs per female; oviposition period, 23. 9, 13. 7, 25. 9, 18. 1 d. Total predation of C. negevi and N. barkeri female was 246. 0, 270. 0, 227. 6, 205. 3 prey at 25 and 35 C, respectively. Rectal plugs were observed attached to the opisthosoma of some adult females of N. barkeri, which often cause the mite to stick to the surface.

Recent {{studies have indicated that}} stigmaeid mites, mainly of the genera Agistemus and Zetzellia, are important natural enemies of pest mites such as B. phoenicis and O. ilicis. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of various chemical compounds (insecticides, acaricides and fungicides) used in coffee and/or citrus plantations (or under registration) in Brazil on the <b>mite</b> <b>pest</b> B. phoenicis and the predator Agistemus brasiliensis Matioli, Ueckermann & Oliveira, 2002 (Acari: Stigmaeidae).

This study was conducted between 2004 and 2006 in an orchard of date palm trees located in southwest Tunisia. The objective {{of this study was}} the inventory of mites that revolve around the date palm, to quantify abundance of O. afrasiaticus in trees over different types of ground cover and to document its dispersal. The starting of O. afrasiaticus infestation on fruits varied between years, ranging from the first to the third week of July. Mite populations on pinnae remained low from May through December, not exceeding two mites per pinnae, whereas on fruit they reached peak populations of approximately 14 motile forms of mite per fruit in 2006. Indigenous phytoseiid were not found on fruits between mid-Julys till the end of August, when pest populations peaked. Plants such as Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, Solanum melongena L., and Cucumis melo L. contained densities of O. afrasiaticus during early spring, and may have formed the source for later date palm infestation. Fruit bunch infestation was not prevented or even alleviated by glue barriers so infestation of date palm by O. afrasiaticus may occur via aerial dispersal of motile forms. In ground cover phytoseiid and tetranychid mites were scarce, two of tetranychid species are new to science were founded...|$|E
40|$|Firstly, {{we develop}} a {{sampling}} methodology for making pest treatment {{decisions based on}} mean pest density. Previous research assumes pest densities are uniformly distributed over space, and advocates using sequential, presence-absence sampling plans for making treatment decisions. Here we develop a spatial sampling plan which accommodates pest densities which vary over space and which exhibit spatial correlation, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology using parameter values calibrated from empirical data on Oligonychus perseae, a <b>mite</b> <b>pest</b> of avocados. To ourknowledge, this research {{is the first to}} combine sequential hypothesis testing techniques with presence-absence sampling strategies which account for spatially correlated pest densities. Secondly, we investigate "The Corridor Problem", a model of morning traffic flow along a corridor to a central business district (CBD). We consider travel time cost and schedule delay (time early) cost, and we assume that a fixed number of identical commuters have the same desired work start-time at the CBD and that late arrivals are prohibited. Traffic flow along the corridor is subject to LWR flow congestion with Greenshields' Relation (i. e., mass conservation for a fluid coupled with a negative linear relationship between velocity and density), and we seek to characterize the no-toll equilibrium or user optimum (UO) solution, in which no commuter can reduce their trip cost, and the social optimum (SO) solution, in which the total population trip cost is minimized. Allowing for a continuum of entry-points into the corridor we develop a numerical algorithm for constructing a UO solution. Restricting to a single entry-point we provide complete characterizations of the SO and UO, with numerical examples and quasi-analytic solutions. Finally, we develop a stochastic model of incident occurrence on a corridor, calibrated using a recently developed change-point detection algorithmapplied to traffic data along a San Diego freeway {{over the course of a}} year, coupled with Hierarchical Generalized Linear Model (HGLM) fitting techniques.

40|$|Oligonychus perseae Tuttle, Baker and Abattiello (Acari: Tetranchidae) is a foliar spider <b>mite</b> <b>pest</b> of avocados, Persea {{americana}} Miller (Lauraceae), {{and both}} are native to Mexico. In California, O. perseae can cause significant premature defoliation to Hass avocados which is most important commercial avocado cultivar in the world market. Recent work form Israel has shown that extensive foliar injury caused by populations of O. perseae on Hass foliage can translate into fruit yield reduction. Consequently, there is warranted concern over the damage from O. peseae populations in other Hass producing areas such as Spain, Israel, and Costa Rica, but also within its home range in Mexico. In California, great effort has been placed in developing and implementing an integrated pest management program for O. perseae, but improvements are still needed for effective control of this pest in commercial Hass orchards. In particular, the success of releases of commercially-available phytoseiids {{as part of an}} inoculation biological control program has been limited, the role of resident phytoseiids for control of O. perseae is not well understood, and effective research-based sampling plans to monitor the activity of O. perseae and resident phytoseiids are not available. Consequently, the motivation for conducting the work presented in the five chapters of this dissertation was to address these limitations. The first chapter provides insight into the trophic interactions between O. perseae and natural enemies in California Hass avocados. This information can be used to improve the current biological control program of O. perseae in California and potentially other avocado systems where this spider mite occurs. The second chapter examines the limitations of the current sampling guidelines recommended for assessing O. perseae densities. The third chapter focuses on the development and validation of a binomial sampling plan for O. perseae that minimizes the counting effort and could be used by pest control advisers to monitor levels of this pest in commercial orchards.
