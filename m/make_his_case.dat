5|$|In the 1930s Abd al-Rahman {{spoke out}} against a treaty between Egypt and Britain that {{recognized}} Egyptian claims of sovereignty in Sudan, although no Sudanese had been consulted, travelling to London to <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>case.</b> His Ansar followers became an influential faction in the General Congress established in 1938, and in the successor Advisory Council set up in 1944. Abd al-Rahman was patron of the nationalist Ummah (Nation) political Party in the period before and just after Sudan became independent in 1956. In 1958 the Umma party won the most seats in the first parliamentary elections after independence. In November 1958 the army staged a coup, which Abd al-Rahman supported. He died on 24 March 1959, aged 73.|$|E

Karthik returned to India after Zimbabwe tour in 2006 and made 26 and 11 in the Challenger Trophy for India A, which was not {{enough for him to}} force his way into India’s squad for the home ODIs against Sri Lanka and South Africa. In the meantime, he played in the Duleep Trophy and had the chance to <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>case</b> for Test retention. However, he scored only 106 runs at 26.50 in two matches and South Zone lost both of these and were eliminated, and Karthik spent the next month on the sidelines.|$|E
25|$|He uses several {{historical}} {{examples to}} <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>case.</b> These include John Snow's , Charles Joseph Minard's , early space debris plots, Galileo Galilei's Sidereus Nuncius, and Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial. For instance, the {{listing of the}} names of deceased soldiers on the black granite of Lin's sculptural memorial is shown to be more powerful as a chronological list rather than as an alphabetical one. The sacrifice each fallen individual has made is thus highlighted within the overall time scope of the war. In Sidereus Nuncius Galilei presents the nightly observations of the moons of Jupiter in relation to the body itself, interwoven with the two-month narrative record.|$|E

Australia declared at 5/549 when Harvey reached three figures {{and went on to}} complete an innings victory. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton described Harvey's innings as [...] "a superb century, rich in youthful daring and stroke production". Harvey later rated it his best innings of the tour excluding the Test matches.|$|E

He came to the crease at 4/453 and made 34 in a stand of 96 with Harvey. His dismissal and Harvey reaching his 100 prompted Australia to declare at 5/549. Bradman said that Hamence was [...] "the unlucky player of the match" [...] {{and that he was}} standing on the balcony ready to declare when Hamence fell on the last ball of the over. Australia went on to complete an innings victory. In the second innings, Hamence opened the bowling with Ray Lindwall. He took an early wicket before ending the innings by claiming the last man to fall, a stumping by Ron Saggers standing up to the stumps.|$|E

Humphreys called Chotiner at Nixon's hotel in Portland, Oregon that evening, and the campaign manager realized that the broadcast was the best opportunity for the candidate to <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>case.</b> Humphreys suggested Nixon appear on Meet the Press, but Chotiner rejected the suggestion, insisting that his candidate must have complete control of the broadcast [...] "without interruption by possibly unfriendly press questions". Humphreys mentioned that Summerfield was concerned about the cost of a television broadcast, but Chotiner noted that the cost of reprinting all campaign materials to reflect a change on the ticket would be far more than that of a telecast.|$|E

On 10 June 1963, {{in an effort to}} reinvigorate and recontextualize a test ban, President Kennedy dedicated his commencement address at American University to [...] "the most important topic on earth: world peace" [...] and proceeded to <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>case</b> for the treaty.

[...] Second, Kennedy appealed for a new attitude towards the Soviet Union, calling Americans to not [...] "see only a distorted and desperate view of the other side, not to see conflict as inevitable, accommodations as impossible and communication as nothing more than an exchange of threats."

500|$|The golden ratio (roughly {{equal to}} 1.618) {{was known to}} Euclid. The golden ratio has {{persistently}} been claimed in modern times to {{have been used in}} art and architecture by the ancients in Egypt, Greece and elsewhere, without reliable evidence. The claim may derive from confusion with [...] "golden mean", which to the Ancient Greeks meant [...] "avoidance of excess in either direction", not a ratio. Pyramidologists since the nineteenth century have argued on dubious mathematical grounds for the golden ratio in pyramid design. The Parthenon, a 5th-century BC temple [...] in Athens, has been claimed to use the golden ratio in its façade and floor plan, but these claims too are disproved by measurement. The Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia has similarly been claimed to use the golden ratio in its design, but the ratio does not appear in the original parts of the mosque. The historian of architecture Frederik Macody Lund argued in 1919 that the Cathedral of Chartres (12th century), Notre-Dame of Laon (1157–1205) and Notre Dame de Paris (1160) are designed according to the golden ratio, drawing regulator lines to <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>case.</b> Other scholars argue that until Pacioli's work in 1509, the golden ratio was unknown to artists and architects. For example, the height and width of the front of Notre-Dame of Laon have the ratio 8/5 or 1.6, not 1.618. Such Fibonacci ratios quickly become hard to distinguish from the golden ratio. After Pacioli, the golden ratio is more definitely discernible in artworks including Leonardo's Mona Lisa.|$|E

2500|$|In the Third Quatrain, Greene {{recognizes the}} shift from the overt actions of the other suitors toward the {{inverted}} and humble actions of the Speaker. The Speaker wishes {{to be seen as}} dutiful and devout by the Friend. To do so, the Third Quatrain employs language that evokes thoughts of a religious servant who makes sacrifice. According to Greene, [...] "In this secularized sacrament, the dutiful poet freely makes an offering intended to manifest the inwardness and simplicity of his own devotion, knowing, or thinking that he knows, that his oblation will win him the unmediated, inner reciprocity which is his goal". Greene adds that the [...] "unformulated implication of the work as a whole seems to be that expense is never truly recuperated". Though the Speaker is seeking a relationship of reciprocity through means not employed by the other suitors, he still uses the art of poetry to <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>case</b> for the affection of the Friend. Greene sees this as the wedge between the Speaker and the object of his affection. He says, [...] "Language is condemned to be compound; poetry is art; it shapes and forms and distorts; it introduces inequalities, like the inequality between an offering and an exchange, or the inequality between a secular offering and the sacramental body of Christ". Thus, the Speaker has created a distance between himself and the Friend by creating these sonnets.|$|E
