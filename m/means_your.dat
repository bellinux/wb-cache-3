He ceased consulting his colleagues and made {{more and more}} of the decisions himself. Although Nasser repeatedly said [...] that a war with Israel will start at a time of his, or Arab, choosing, in 1967 he started a bluffing game [...] "but a successful bluff <b>means</b> <b>your</b> opponent must not know which cards you are holding. In this case Nasser's opponent could see his hand in the mirror and knew he was only holding a pair of deuces" [...] and Nasser knew that his army is not prepared yet. [...] "All of this was out of character...His tendencies in this regard may have been accentuated by diabetes... That was the only rational explanation for his actions in 1967".|$|E
500|$|The show's {{popularity}} {{resulted in}} enquiries for coats similar to Sherlock's, reported retailer Debenhams. Garment manufacturer Belstaff put the wool trench coat worn by Benedict Cumberbatch back into production before the series had ended. The Independent reported, [...] "designer Paul Costelloe moved {{to meet the}} demand, offering tailored coats and scarves based on the series, while Savile Row bespoke tailor John Pearse said many of his clients were inquiring about the actors' clothes." [...] Journalist Alexis Petridis commented, [...] "ou can see why men {{wanted to get the}} look. Perhaps they noted the effect Cumberbatch, by no <b>means</b> <b>your</b> standard telly hunk, had on lady viewers â€¦ and decided it must {{have something to do with}} the clobber. So it is that Britain's latest men's style icon is a fictional asexual sociopath first seen onscreen hitting a corpse with a horse whip. Surely not even the great detective himself could have deduced that was going to happen." ...|$|E

"I don't <b>mean</b> <b>your</b> resentment toward them," [...] said Philip, who had {{his reasons}} for some sympathy with this view of Tom, [...] "though a feeling of revenge is not worth much, that you should care to keep it.

2500|$|When in 1960 and 1961 he {{published}} his best-known work, respectively the books Tjies and Tjoek, Dutch literary critics immediately praised his style and narrative. However {{they found it}} hard to comprehend the Indies environment he was describing. Tjalie Robinson himself consequently decided to give all his focus to the advancement of the Indo community in diaspora and the social objectives he coupled to that, by solely publishing in his own magazine. In 1963 he wrote: [...] "I couldnt care less about literary life, in reality that only <b>means</b> <b>your</b> a name in a bookcase. Writing should have a living social function. 90% of what we call literature is just phraseology, obsequious embellishment and blatherskite." ...|$|E
