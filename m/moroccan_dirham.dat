40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{estimate}} the equilibrium real exchange rate and derive the degree of misalignment for five MENA currencies: the Algerian Dinar, the <b>Moroccan</b> <b>Dirham,</b> the Egyptian Pound, the Tunisian Dinar and the Turkish lira. Exchange rate policy represents a key tool in macro-economic management and dominates the public policy debate today. How to assess whether exchange rate is undervalued or overvalued with respect to its equilibrium value is clearly at the heart of this debate. An extensive analysis of the degree of misalignment of the five currencies is undertaken on the basis of detailed country specific data. Overall, our results pick up almost perfectly the exchange rate policy episodes in the five countries. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to {{estimate}} the behavioral equilibrium exchange rate in Morocco. Since the equilibrium value is unobservable, we use a set of fundamentals supposed to affect the exchange rate movements including the real net capital flows (NKF), terms of trade shocks (TOT), government fiscal stance (GOV), foreign reserve level (RES), index of monetary policy (MOP) and relative productivity (PROD) to get it. Using quarterly data from 1980 Q 1 to 2012 Q 4, the empirical analysis commences by checking the stationarity of the variables that turn out to be all stationary at first difference. Then, using the cointegration test and the Vector-Error Correction Model of the <b>Moroccan</b> <b>Dirham</b> exchange rate as function of the indicated macroeconomic fundamentals, the regression shows that the main fluctuations of the real effective exchange rate are due to trade openness, government spending, terms of trade, the productivity progress, monetary policy and net capital inflow. Accordingly, and using HP decomposition filter we figure out three periods of under/overvaluation ranging from 2. 80 % under to 2. 16 % over equilibrium level, furthermore, the misalignment from the equilibrium level needs from five to six years to be eliminated. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{volatility}} of exchange rates {{leads to a}} reduction of international trade volumes, especially in emerging economies including the South Mediterranean countries. This study discusses the impact of exchange rates on bilateral South- North trade flows, which comes timely after the increased volatility between the Euro and Arab national currencies {{during the last few}} years and after the global financial crisis of 2008 that led to a sharp reduction at that time. We investigate the impact of exchange rate volatility on trade using monthly time series for the last ten years from 2000 up to 2011. By means of a Vector Auto Regression model with eXogenous variables (VARX) we estimate the reactions of bilateral exports and imports in response to exchange rate fluctuations between South and North Mediterranean economies. A sample of three South Arab countries is selected including Egypt, Jordan, and Morocco. Causality tests are conducted to examine the hypotheses. Our results show that the exports of goods from Egypt to the European Union decreases in comparison with the baseline by about 3 % in case of an appreciation of 10 % of the Egyptian pound vis-à-vis the euro, while the imports of Egypt from the EU increase by almost 10 %. Also for Morocco, the imports from the EU react much stronger than the exports to the EU to a similar size appreciation of the <b>Moroccan</b> <b>dirham.</b> Jordan is less import-dependent, though reacts strongly in terms of exports if its dollar-pegged currency appreciates vis-à-vis the euro. Finally, we can conclude that the actual exchange rate changes are quite high. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} threshold {{time series}} model {{is famous for}} its capability in capturing asymmetry. Regime switching takes place immediately when a certain variable crosses the threshold. However, this type of model may not be suitable for data which have no clear cut between regimes. A new generation of threshold type model, buffered time series model, is modified from the traditional threshold time series model. A buffer zone is introduced to replace the role of the threshold; regime switching will not take place within the buffer zone. The regime switching mechanism mimicks a climatological example and the buffered model may be suitable for data {{in which there is a}} region where the probabilistic structure of the data is insensitive to changes. Self-exciting buffered generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (buffered GARCH) model is considered. Quasi-maximum likelihood is employed for parameter estimation. Strong consistency and asymptotic distributions are derived. Simulation experiments are carried out to verify the properties of the estimators. The buffered GARCH model is applied to two currency exchange rate data sets, US dollar to <b>Moroccan</b> <b>dirham</b> exchange rate and US dollar to Israeli new shekel exchange rate. At the same time, threshold GARCH model is also applied to the data sets in order to have comparison between the buffered GARCH model and threshold GARCH model. It is found that the buffered GARCH model beats the threshold GARCH model in terms of one information criterion, revealing that the buffered GARCH model may have advantage over the threshold GARCH model. published_or_final_versionStatistics and Actuarial ScienceMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Breast {{cancer is}} the first cancer in women both in {{incidence}} and mortality. The treatment of breast cancer benefited from the progress of chemotherapy and targeted therapies, {{but there was a}} parallel increase in treatment costs. Despite a relatively high incidence of many sites of cancer, so far, there is no national register for this disease in Morocco. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} estimate the total cost of chemotherapy in the early stages of breast cancer due to its frequency and the chances of patients being cured. This study provides health decision-makers with a first estimate of costs and the opportunity to achieve the optimal use of available data to estimate the needs of antimitotics and trastuzumab in Morocco. Method We start by evaluating the individual cost according to the therapeutic sub-groups, namely: 1. Patients needing chemotherapy with only anthracycline-based therapy. 2. Patients needing chemotherapy with both anthracycline and taxane but without trastuzumab. 3. Patients needing trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy. For each sub-group, the protocol of treatment is described, and the individual costs per unit, and for the whole cycle, are evaluated. Then we estimate the number of women suffering from breast cancer on the basis of two data bases available in Morocco. Finally, we calculate the total annual cost of treatment of breast cancer in Morocco. Results The total cost of breast cancer in Morocco is given in <b>Moroccan</b> <b>dirhams</b> (MAD), the US dollar at the current exchange rate (MAD 10 = USD 1. 30) and in international dollars or purchasing power parity (MAD 10 = PPP 1. 95). The cost of a therapy with trastuzumab is 8. 4 times the cost of a sequential chemotherapy combining anthracycline and taxane, and nearly 60 times the cost of chemotherapy based on anthracycline alone. Globally, between USD 13. 3 million and USD 28. 6 million need to be devoted every year by the Moroccan health authorities to treat women with localized breast cancer in keeping with international recommendations. Discussion According to our estimation methods, the complete cost of adjuvant chemotherapy including trastuzumab will range from 1. 3 to 2. 4 % of the global budget of the Moroccan Health Department (MAD 9. 8 billion or USD 1. 274 billion). Unfortunately, only one-third of the Moroccan population has healthcare insurance whereas for each patient the treatment with chemotherapy alone costs 1. 15 times the annual minimum income (MAD 23, 710 or USD 3, 082), and treatment requiring both chemotherapy and trastuzumab costs 9. 76 times the annual minimum income. For the tumour over expressing HER 2 Neu, we need to treat 25 women in order to save (cure) one woman: the calculated cost for one life saved is USD 663, 000. The question is, is it cost-effective for an emerging country? Conclusion In this paper we aimed at evaluating the total cost of chemotherapy in the early stages of breast cancer in order to provide health decision-makers with a first estimation and a good opportunity for the optimal use of available data for the needs of antimitotics and trastuzumab in Morocco. Different protocols were considered and the individual cost of the whole treatment was given according to therapies using anthracycline alone, sequential chemotherapy combining anthracycline and taxane, and sequential chemotherapy with trastuzumab. According to our estimations, Moroccan health authorities need to devote between USD 13. 3 million and USD 28. 6 million every year in order to treat women suffering from localized breast cancer in ways consistent with international recommended standards. </p...|$|R
