40|$|Abstract Background Antenatal care (ANC) {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{as a way}} to improve health outcomes for pregnant women and their babies. However, only 29 % of pregnant women receive the recommended four antenatal visits in Nepal but reasons for such low utilisation are poorly understood. As in many countries of South Asia, <b>mothers-in-law</b> {{play a crucial role in}} the decisions around accessing health care facilities and providers. This paper aims to explore the <b>mother-in-law's</b> role in (a) her daughter-in-law's ANC uptake; and (b) the decision-making process about using ANC services in Nepal. Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with 30 purposively selected antenatal or postnatal mothers (half users, half non-users of ANC), 10 husbands and 10 <b>mothers-in-law</b> in two different (urban and rural) communities. Results Our findings suggest that <b>mothers-in-law</b> sometime have a positive influence, for example when encouraging women to seek ANC, but more often it is negative. Like many rural women of their generation, all <b>mothers-in-law</b> in this study were illiterate and most had not used ANC themselves. The main factors leading <b>mothers-in-law</b> not to support/encourage ANC check ups were expectations regarding pregnant women fulfilling their household duties, perceptions that ANC was not beneficial based largely on their own past experiences, the scarcity of resources under their control and power relations between <b>mothers-in-law</b> and daughters-in-law. Individual knowledge and social class of the <b>mothers-in-law</b> of users and non-users differed significantly, which is likely to have had an effect on their perceptions of the benefits of ANC. Conclusion <b>Mothers-in-law</b> have a strong influence on the uptake of ANC in Nepal. Understanding their role is important if we are to design and target effective community-based health promotion interventions. Health promotion and educational interventions to improve the use of ANC should target women, husbands and family members, particularly <b>mothers-in-law</b> where they control access to family resources. </p...|$|R
40|$|In India, the <b>mothers-in-law</b> {{are often}} portrayed {{as the most}} {{powerful}} entity in the household in Indian popular culture and media. Similarly, in the literature, the influence of the Indian <b>mothers-in-law</b> is often taken for granted. However, most of the empirical evidence relies on qualitative data or on small samples. Looking at stated son preference and using the third nationally representative National Family and Health Survey dataset, we show that <b>mothers-in-law</b> do indeed have an influence on their daughter-in-law, everything else constant. Given the stronger son preference among <b>mothers-in-law,</b> this contributes to the high imbalance in the male to female sex-ratio observed among children in India...|$|R
