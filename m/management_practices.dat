In agriculture, less fossil fuel is used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time with the use of draft animals such as horses. Logging with horses can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging.|$|E

5|$|Most {{states had}} placed {{restrictions}} on fisher trapping by the 1930s, coincidental {{with the end}} of the logging boom. A combination of forest regrowth in abandoned farmlands and improved forest <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> increased available habitat and allowed remnant populations to recover. Populations have since recovered sufficiently that the species is no longer endangered. Increasing forest cover in eastern North America means that fisher populations will remain sufficiently robust for the near future. Between 1955 and 1985, some states had allowed limited trapping to resume. In areas where fishers were eliminated, porcupine populations subsequently increased. Areas with a high density of porcupines were found to have extensive damage to timber crops. In these cases, fishers were reintroduced by releasing adults relocated from other places into the forest. Once the fisher populations became reestablished, porcupine numbers returned to natural levels. In Washington State, fisher sightings were reported into the 1980s, but an extensive survey in the 1990s did not locate any.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{seemingly}} marginal {{contribution of}} management theory to <b>management</b> <b>practice</b> has been commented on in different contexts. Specifi cally, critical management studies (CMS) seems suspended in an impasse between the aim to critique dominant <b>management</b> <b>practice</b> and discourse, and the expectation to facilitate transformative management action. This paper {{argues that the}} theory–practice impasse may, in part, {{be a result of}} reductivist perspectives discursively produced by both mainstream and critical management studies. To illustrate this argument, the paper refers to a case study exploring middle <b>management</b> <b>practice</b> in the higher education context. It demonstrates that academic middle <b>management</b> <b>practice</b> as constructed by polarized and polarizing discourses of either managerial or critical orientation is counterproductive to a full understanding of this practice and the contribution it can make to organizations if properly understood, and proposes an alternative reading aimed to ‘cross the divide’ between discourses and between theory and practice.

5|$|The Rathores, {{traditional}} {{rulers of}} the Marwar region of western India, {{were the first to}} breed the Marwari. Beginning in the 12th century, they espoused strict breeding that promoted purity and hardiness. Used throughout history as a cavalry horse by the people of the Marwar region, the Marwari was noted for its loyalty and bravery in battle. The breed deteriorated in the 1930s, when poor <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> resulted in a reduction of the breeding stock, but today has regained some of its popularity. The Marwari is used for light draught and agricultural work, as well as riding and packing. In 1995, a breed society was formed for the Marwari in India. The exportation of Marwaris was banned for decades, but between 2000 and 2006, a small number of exports were allowed. Since 2008, visas allowing temporary travel of Marwaris outside India have been available in small numbers.|$|E
