40|$|The {{importance}} {{of the role of}} human performance in the successful and effective operation of many activities throughout many industries has been well documented. Most closely related to the <b>materials</b> <b>control</b> and accountability area is the work in human factors that has been ongoing in the U. S. nuclear industry since the Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant accident in 1979. Research related to the role of human reliability, human-system interface, and organization and management influences has been and is still being conducted to identify ways to enhance the safe and effective operation of nuclear facilities. This paper will discuss these human performance areas and how they relate to the <b>materials</b> <b>control</b> and accountability area. Particular attention will be focussed on the notion of {open_quotes}safety culture{close_quotes} and how it can be defined and measured for understanding the values and attitudes held by individuals working in the <b>materials</b> <b>control</b> area. It is widely believed that the culture of an organization, which reflects the expectations and values of the management of an organization, is a key element to the operation of that organization. The human performance element is one which has not received a great deal of consideration in the <b>materials</b> <b>control</b> and accountability area and yet it will be demonstrated that it is an essential component to ensure the success of safeguards activities...|$|R

50|$|A {{supply chain}} can be {{classified}} as a stage 1, 2 or 3 network. In a stage 1-type supply chain, systems such as production, storage, distribution, and <b>material</b> <b>control</b> are not linked and are independent of each other. In a stage 2 supply chain, these are integrated under one plan and is ERP enabled. A stage 3 supply chain is one that achieves vertical integration with upstream suppliers and downstream customers. An example {{of this kind of}} supply chain is Tesco.|$|E
50|$|The COMSEC {{channel is}} {{composed}} {{of a series of}} COMSEC accounts, each of which has an appointed COMSEC Custodian who is personally responsible and accountable for all COMSEC materials charged to his/her account. The COMSEC Custodian assumes accountability for the equipment or material upon receipt, then controls its dissemination to authorized individuals on job requirements and a need-to-know basis. The administrative channel is used to distribute COMSEC information other than that which is accountable in the COMSEC <b>Material</b> <b>Control</b> System.|$|E

To provide any benefit, the facility, systems, and equipment must be thoroughly designed, submitted to, {{and approved by}} a responsible, thorough, professional architectural and engineering design team to function correctly. The design team incorporates the documented owner's program of requirements (OPR) which identifies the owner's systems, equipment, <b>materials,</b> <b>control,</b> and performance expectations. The design team identifies and documents the project basis of design (BOD) which specifically identifies the OPR items, how each was implemented in the design (or modified), and the final design basis for systems, equipment, <b>materials,</b> <b>control,</b> and performance expectations.|$|R

Kaufman also devised a method to build homes on cement slabs, which enabled the firm to make a heavy impact on the Detroit market {{at a time of}} dwindling demand and high competition for home buyers. The company expanded to Arizona in 1962 and into California in 1963 and was the first U.S. homebuilder to expand into France in 1967.|$|E

50|$|The PAEC's {{directorate}} for Nuclear Safety and Radiation Control (NSRC) {{was responsible}} for the radiation and high radioactive <b>material</b> <b>control</b> in the country. However, in 2001, with the establishment of the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority (PNRA), the responsibilities were shifted to PNRA. In 2003, the responsibilities and agency's goals were expanded, as PNRA were given the status of an executive agency. The PNRA oversees reactor safety and security, reactor licensing and renewal, radioactive material safety, security and licensing, and spent fuel management (storage, security, recycling, and disposal). The PNRA closely work with Chinese CNNC, and is frequently visited by Chinese staff as its technical advisers.|$|E
50|$|Material protection, control, and {{accounting}} {{is the process}} of protecting nuclear assets such as nuclear fuel and nuclear weapons. The MPC&A Program is part of the U.S. Department of Energy's nonproliferation program, under the National Nuclear Security Administration. This program seeks to improve the security of nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons material through upgrades to material protection and <b>material</b> <b>control</b> {{and accounting}} at nuclear sites in Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union. Since the program's inception as part of the Department of Defense's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, it has improved the security on thousands of tons of weapons grade nuclear material in the FSU.|$|E
5000|$|Part of the {{physical}} security protection given to COMSEC equipment and material is afforded by its special handling and accounting. CCI equipment must be controlled {{in a manner that}} affords protection at least equal to that normally provided other high value equipment, such as money, computers, and Privacy Act-controlled. There are two separate channels used for the handling of such equipment and materials: [...] "the COMSEC channel" [...] and [...] "the administrative channel." [...] The COMSEC channel, called the COMSEC <b>Material</b> <b>Control</b> System, is used to distribute accountable COMSEC items such as classified and CCI equipment, keying material, and maintenance manuals. Some military departments have been authorized to distribute CCI equipment through their standard logistics system.|$|E
