50|$|Baroque pop's {{mainstream}} popularity faded by the 1970s, {{partially because}} punk rock, disco and hard rock took over; nonetheless, music was still produced within the genre's tradition.

5|$|Darwin made long {{journeys}} inland with travelling companions {{from the}} locality. He spent <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> {{away from the}} ship, returning by prearrangement when the Beagle returned to ports where mail could be received and Darwin's notes, journals, and collections sent back to England. He had ensured that his collections were his own and they were shipped back to Henslow in Cambridge to await his return. Several others on board including FitzRoy and other officers were able amateur naturalists, and they gave Darwin generous assistance as well as making collections for the Crown, which the Admiralty placed in the British Museum.|$|E

5|$|Further, young giraffes {{are much}} more {{vulnerable}} to predation than adults: between 60% and 75% of calves die within a year. Mothers hide their calves, which spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> lying down in cover. Since {{the presence of a}} mother does not affect survival, Mitchell suggests that young giraffes must be extremely well camouflaged. This is supported by the fact that coat markings are strongly inherited. Conversely, far from hiding, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves even from lions.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, Petrie {{launched}} the academic journal Ancient Egypt, published {{through his own}} British School of Archaeology in Egypt (BSAE), which was based at UCL. Given that he was often away from London excavating in Egypt, Murray was left to operate as de facto editor <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> She also published many research articles in the journal and authored many of its book reviews, particularly of the German-language publications which Petrie could not read.|$|E

The person had to be suffering from delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. A second symptom could be negative symptoms, or severely disorganized or catatonic behaviour. The definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes.|$|E

5|$|The Creppings were lords of {{the manor}} {{followed}} by the Leigh or Legh family. John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, held the manor from 1363 to 1370 and Simon Simeon, whose will mentioned coal mines, from 1401–1406. The Leighs held the manor for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> between 1300 until 1697 when Anne Leigh married Ralph Brandling of Felling in Durham. The Leighs once occupied New Hall whose name is recalled in the street names in the area.

5|$|As the Second World War loomed, the British Admiralty {{commissioned}} Lethbridge {{to undertake}} a reconnaissance mission to Iceland to analyse German naval activity around the country, which he carried out in summer 1939. Lethbridge however treated the mission with contempt, spending <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> visiting sites that interested him, such as locations mentioned in the Icelandic Sagas. Back in Britain, he self-published a short volume discussing his Icelandic journey, News from Tili. As war broke out, Lethbridge organised the transfer {{of much of the}} museum's collections to Balsham Caves for safe keeping, while also becoming a warden of the Air Raid Precautions. He also led the rescue excavation of ten prehistoric tumuli that were being destroyed to enable the construction of Snailwell Airfield for the Royal Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker {{began his}} {{campaign}} with {{a week of}} local campaigning in his riding, after which he went to Toronto for the Massey Hall speech. After two days in Ontario, he spoke {{at a rally in}} Quebec City, before spending the remainder of the first week in the Maritimes. The next week saw Diefenbaker spend two days in Quebec, after which he campaigned in Ontario. The next two weeks included a Western tour, with brief returns to Ontario, the most populous province. The final two weeks saw Diefenbaker spend <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> in Ontario, though with brief journeys east to the Maritimes and Quebec and twice west to Saskatchewan. He returned to his riding for the final weekend before the Monday election. He spent 39days on the campaign trail, eleven more than the Prime Minister.|$|E

5|$|Egg-laying (ovipositing) {{involves}} {{not only}} the female darting over floating or waterside vegetation to deposit eggs on a suitable substrate, but also the male hovering above her or continuing to clasp her and flying in tandem. The male attempts to prevent rivals from removing his sperm and inserting their own, something made possible by delayed fertilisation and driven by sexual selection. If successful, a rival male uses his penis to compress or scrape out the sperm inserted previously; this activity takes up <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that a copulating pair remains in the heart posture. Flying in tandem has the advantage that less effort is needed by the female for flight and more can be expended on egg-laying, and when the female submerges to deposit eggs, the male may help to pull {{her out of the}} water.|$|E
5|$|For {{short-range}} missile (throwing) weapons, a Roman infantryman {{would probably}} had either a long throwing-spear {{or two or}} three short javelins (lanceae) and half a dozen plumbatae (weighted darts) with an effective range of about 30m. Ammianus talks of a variety of missiles being thrown by the Alamanni in the battle: spicula (a kind of long pilum-type javelin, also known as an angon), verruta missilia (short throwing-spears) and ferratae arundines (probably darts and franciscas: throwing-axes). Overall, there appears little difference in the throwing-missile capability of the contenders. Ammianus indicates that the Roman infantry ranks were obliged to hold their shields above their heads for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> due to the volume of missiles raining down on them.|$|E
5|$|<b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> spent {{outside of}} battle takes place {{either in the}} game's overworld or within dungeons, caves, and other locales with puzzles {{integrated}} into their layout. Unlike the original game, in which the overworld was explored on foot except for a brief, non-navigable boat ride, {{a large portion of}} The Lost Age's gameplay involves navigating a magical ship across a large sea, visiting continents and islands. To complete puzzles, players must either push pillars to construct negotiable paths between elevated areas, climb up or descend cliffs, or obtain a special item to progress through the story and game world. Many of these puzzles revolve heavily around the usage of the game’s resident form of magic spells, Psynergy, requiring the player to find items that grant the bearer new forms of Psynergy in order to accomplish tasks. Acquiring new Psynergy spells gives players access to new locations and secrets hidden within the game world.|$|E

5|$|Only 403 (45 percent) of {{the total}} number of sorties flown by Fighter Command were {{directed}} at the three major German raids. A further 56 (or just over 6 per cent) were standing patrols to protect shipping off the coast. Most of the remaining 427 sorties (nearly 50 per cent) were made to engage the reconnaissance aircraft. Usually several half-squadrons were committed. This was not excessive. But by sending more units to counter the flights, German aircraft were forced to fly higher and were denied the opportunity to drop to low altitude to take higher resolution photographs. This contributed to a lack of German intelligence which often failed to distinguish fighter, bomber and naval airfields from each other. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> their strength was directed at non-fighter airfields on this date.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against Surrey {{and started the}} day after the Test. After 16 days of cricket in 20 {{calendar}} days, Barnes was rested as Australia completed a 10-wicket win. Barnes returned for the following game against Gloucestershire. The tourists elected to bat first and Barnesplaying many square cutsmade 44 in an opening partnership of 102 with Morris, who went on to top-score with 290. Australia reached 7/774 declared, its highest score for the tour, laying the groundwork for a victory by an innings and 363 runs. When Australia was fielding, Barnes was not at his characteristic close-range position, but spent <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> at third man or fine leg {{near the edge of the}} playing arena. At times, Barnes wandered about aimlessly between various positions, but Hassett, captaining in place of the resting Bradman, did not attempt to command him.|$|E
5|$|The {{record is}} known for the {{difficulty}} Priestess encountered in trying to release it. The band's extensive touring schedule for their previous album Hello Master consumed <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> they would have used to write new material, and after they began doing so, they had disputes with RCA Records, their international distributor at the time, {{as to whether the}} new songs were acceptable. After the completion of the recording sessions, which were themselves problematic, RCA ultimately refused to release the album, fearing it was not commercial enough, but allowed the group to release it on another label. Tee Pee Records signed the group thereafter and released the album internationally. Priestess were still signed to Indica Records, but only for Canadian distribution; the release on Indica was withheld until an international distributor was found.|$|E
