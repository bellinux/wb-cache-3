40|$|Abstract—The {{case study}} was {{conducted}} to show the effect of <b>milking</b> <b>method</b> in goat called half day milking on the milk production and the growth of kids. Data were collected by interviewing farmers and investigating goat production in the communal goat housing from June 2008 to May 2009. The interview was conducted to collect data about goat management. The observations were conducted on 10 goats, which were selected based on the uniformity of age, number of kid born/goat and the <b>milking</b> <b>method</b> in practice. The samples were divided into two groups; those were full 3 months nursing and half day milked goats (in this group the kids were separated from goat during the previous night milking and then the kids were allowed to suck the goat during the day). The result showed that the communal goat housing had 138 goats and 25 % of the farmers milked the goat. The implementation of half day milking increased the milk production significantly (P< 0. 05) and it did not affect the kids ’ growth. It was concluded that half day milking was beneficial to increase milk production. In the communal goat housing was possible to implement the result of this innovation to all members of the farmer group as a method in increasing goat milk production.

The data used in this study were 11, 430 individual test-day milk yield records collected from November 2004 to November 2006 on 813 cows reared on 15 family farms in Croatia. Milk recording was performed according to A 4 and A 6 <b>milk</b> recording <b>method</b> by the field officer of the Croatian Livestock Centre. From the corrected database with test-day records, two different datasets were created. The first dataset (A 4; n = 7, 500) included test day records collected every four weeks, while the second dataset (A 6; n = 3, 830) included test day records collected every six weeks. When lactation milk yields were predicted from alternative <b>milk</b> recording <b>methods</b> (AT 4, AT 6), daily (24 h) milk yield was estimated from single evening or morning milk yield using linear model that taken into account effect of interval between successive milkings. Lactation milk yield was calculated for three different days in milk (100, 200 and 305 days) using the Test Interval Method (TIM) that is reference method by ICAR (ICAR, 2003). Results show that the alternate <b>milk</b> recording <b>method</b> at 4 -week intervals provides low bias and high accuracy of prediction of 100, 200 and 305 -milk yields, while <b>milk</b> recording <b>methods</b> at 6 -week intervals gives prediction of 305 -milk yield with higher bias and lower accuracy.

40|$|Yak milk plays a very {{important}} role in Tibetan’s daily life. Milk and milk products are the major dietary ingredients as well as family incomes of Tibetan herders in China. Yak milk yield and composition are seasonal and affected by the breed, age, parity and body condition of cow, pasture growth and quality, milking time, milking methods and environmental factors. In this paper, milk production and composition of different breeds are documented, and effects of feeding level, milking time, <b>milking</b> <b>method,</b> environmental factors on milking performance are discussed. It is found that Batang yak from Qinghai Province peaks and Jiali yak from Tibet Autonomous Region bottoms milk production, with 487. 2 and 147. 6 kg fresh milk per lactation respectively. Comparatively, milk of Jiulong yak and Sibu yak has higher dry matter and fat contents, and milk of Tianzhu White yak contains more protein and lactose. Winter supplementation on dams can improve calf production and milk yield of mother yaks in the following warm season. Compared with once-a-day milking, twice-a-day milking stimulates yak female to give about one third more milk, which, however negatively affect the growth of calves.

References in the literature for protocols describing how to milk a dam are scarce, and a major limitation of such protocols is the small sample volume that is generally collected. The aim of our study was to develop a practical protocol to collect substantial amounts of milk from mice. Adult female outbred NMRI and inbred BALB/c mice with nursing litters were used in this study. The milking was carried out on days 7 – 12 after parturition. The pups were separated from their mothers for 6 – 12 h before milking to allow accumulation of milk in the glands. Dams were anesthetized using either an injectable mixture of midazolam and ketamine, or by use of the inhalational agent isoflurane. To induce milk flow, the mice were given 2 - 8 IU of oxytocin intraperitoneally. The milk was collected using an electric human breast pump that was modified to accommodate mouse nipples and to handle small liquid volumes. With this protocol, the total amount of milk collected from each dam per each milking ranged between 0. 2 and 1. 5 mL.

40|$|Objective: This {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} from April to July 2012 to estimate the prevalence of brucellosis and investigate the risk factors that enhance its occurrence in cattle in Khartoum state, the Sudan. Material and methods: A total of 300 serum samples were taken from jugular veins of cattle and screened by Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) and Serum Agglutination Test (SAT). The RBPT-positive samples were all tested using c-ELISA. Results: Antibodies were detected with an overall seroprevalence of 25. 7 % using RBPT and 22. 7 % using SAT while slightly less than {{two thirds of the}} RBPT-positive samples were cELISA-positive. The herd and within-herd seroprevalences were 76. 7 % (n= 23) and from 10. 0 - 80. 0 %. Moreover, significant statistical dissimilarities were not observed between the seroprevalence of the different categories of the investigated risk factors by RBPT. Only <b>milking</b> <b>method</b> (and # 967; 2 = 3. 976; P= 0. 046) was found to have an influence on the RBPT-positive status for brucella infection in the univariate analysis. Additionally, natural breeding (OR= 3. 61; 95 % CI 1. 192 and ndash; 10. 96; P= 0. 023) was the only observed risk factor with an increased odd of being RBPT positive. The Kappa analysis showed an almost perfect agreement between the results of the RBPT and the SAT tests. Conclusion: The prevalence of anti-brucella antibodies in Khartoum state was relatively higher; therefore, brucellosis in cattle is, perhaps, a significant public health problem.

We calculated infant nifurtimox exposure of a breastfed infant of a mother treated with this drug to be below 10 % of the maternal weight-adjusted dose, even if milk-plasma ratio were overestimated. Simulation led to similar estimates. Discussion Risk for significant infant exposure to nifurtimox through breast milk seems small and below the level of exposure of infants with Chagas disease receiving nifurtimox treatment.

Conclusion because there were no differences between the nutritional status of CMA infants who consumed breast milk and hypoallergenic milk. Therefore it is recommended giving breast milk or hypoallergenic milk for the first 6 months of life to reduce cow’s milk protein exposure...|$|R
40|$|Background. We {{previously}} reported that infants in Kenya were infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) at < 6 months of age, suggesting that mothers were the likely source of transmissible virus to the infant. In this study, we investigated whether breast milk contained infectious EBV {{and the role}} of malaria in EBV shedding in breast <b>milk.</b> <b>Methods.</b> Breast <b>milk</b> samples were obtained from Kenyan mothers at postpartum weeks 6, 10, 14, and 18 and analyzed for presence of infectious EBV. Results. We found that the prevalence of EBV DNA and the mean EBV load were significantly higher at 6 weeks and decreased through postpartum week 18 (P <. 0001). High EBV load in breast milk correlated with mothers who had Plasmodium falciparum malaria at delivery. To determine whether viral DNA was encapsidated, breast milk samples were treated with DNAse before DNA extraction. Sixty percent of samples were DNAse resistant, suggesting that the viral DNA in breast milk was encapsidated. Next, we exposed peripheral blood mononuclear cells to breast milk supernatant, which resulted in the generation of EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines, indicating that the virus in breast milk was infectious. Conclusions. Our data suggest that breast milk contains infectious EBV and is a potential source of viral transmission to infants living in malaria-endemic regions...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Pseudomonas spp. are {{considered}} the most important milk spoilage organisms. Here we describe development of a {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) probe specific for detection and enumeration of Pseudomonas spp. in <b>milk.</b> <b>Methods</b> and Results: 16 S rRNA sequences were analysed to develop specific oligonucleotide probe for the genus Pseudomonas. Twenty different Pseudomonas spp. and 23 bacterial species from genera other than Pseudomonas (as negative controls) were tested. All tested Pseudomonas spp. yielded a positive FISH reaction, whereas negative controls showed no FISH reaction except for Burkholderia cepacia that showed a relatively weak FISH reaction. The FISH assay specifically stains Pseudomonas in milk when the milk contains a mixture of other bacterial species. The FISH assay takes 2 h and compares favourably with current culturing methods, which take a minimum of 48 h. Specificity of the probe was validated using polymerase chain reaction to selectively amplifying the Pseudomonas rDNA gene and sequencing the gene products. Conclusions: The method presented in this study allows simultaneously detection, identification and enumeration of Pseudomonas spp. in milk. Significance and Impact of the Study: Rapid and accurate enumeration of Pseudomonas facilitates the identification of specific contamination sources in dairy plants, the accurate validation of pasteurization treatments and the prediction of shelf life of processed milk. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{shelf life}} of pasteurized milk is {{traditionally}} {{estimated by the}} counts of both total and psychrotrophic microbial load. However, the values reported to date for both microbial populations {{at the end of}} the sensory shelf life of milk vary, and are not consistent. The present study examined the relation between the total and psychrotophic microbial growth in milk and its sensory shelf life as measured using the Weibull hazard <b>method.</b> <b>Milk</b> was stored at 5 constant temperatures (2, 5, 7, 12, and 15 C) and both total and psychrotrophic microbial counts were used to obtain the lag time and the growth rate values. The lag time of the total and psychrotrophic growth responded to temperature following the Arrhenius equation. The loss of sensory quality of the milk followed a log shelf life vs. temperature dependency. It was found that there was no correlation between the microbial count at the end of shelf life and the sensory quality of the milk. It is therefore suggested that microbial counts should not be used to determine the sensory shelf life of <b>milk.</b> The Weibull <b>method</b> gave end of shelf life values fairly similar to that of prior work using the ADSA scoring <b>method.</b> (<b>milk,</b> shelf-life, weibull-hazard) ...|$|R
40|$|See the Editorial Commentary by Osterholm {{on pages}} 910 – 1.) Background. Cattle are {{the second most}} common source of human campylobacteriosis. However, routes to ac-count for this scale of {{transmission}} have not been identified. In contrast to chicken, red meat is not heavily contam-inated at point of sale. Although effective pasteurization prevents milk-borne infection, apparently sporadic infections may include undetected outbreaks from raw or perhaps incompletely pasteurized <b>milk.</b> <b>Methods.</b> A rise in Campylobacter gastroenteritis in an isolated population was investigated using whole-genome sequencing (WGS), an epidemiological study, and environmental investigations. Results. A single strain was identified in 20 cases, clearly distinguishable from other local strains and a reference population by WGS. A case-case analysis showed association of infection with the outbreak strain and milk from a single dairy (odds ratio, 8; Fisher exact test P value =. 023). Despite temperature records indicating effective pasteur-ization, mechanical faults likely to lead to incomplete pasteurization of part of the milk were identified by further testing and examination of internal components of dairy equipment. Conclusions. Here, milk distribution concentrated on a small area, including school-aged children with low background incidence of campylobacteriosis, facilitated outbreak identification. Low-level contamination of widely distributed milk would not produce as detectable an outbreak signal. Such hidden outbreaks may contribut...|$|R
40|$|Milk is an {{important}} fluid in glycobiology because it contains anumber of short carbohydrate chains either free or asglycoconjugates. These compounds as a class are the mostabundant component and benefit the infant by developing andmaintaining the infant’s gut flora.
