40|$|A binary CDMA bus is {{proposed}} as a communications interconnect for multiprocessor systems. The binary CDMA bus is a digital bus which incorporates spreadspectrum technology to encode multiple data streams in parallel onto the same physical interconnect. Mean value analysis {{is used to}} show that, for resource bandwidth-limited applications, the binary CDMA bus can deliver a throughput speedup over a split-transaction bus as large numbers of processors are interconnected, giving more scalable performance without additional end-to-end physical bus links. By <b>monitoring</b> <b>bus</b> utilization, the binary CDMA bus can be dynamically activated to alleviate contention and queueing delays experienced by a conventional bus. The inherently parallel access of the bus makes it useful for streaming data in DSP applications. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a fault {{location}} method using power quality monitoring data is proposed. The {{fault location}} {{is divided into}} two classes including fault line recognition and fault distance calculation. Along the each power line in the target network some fictitious fault points are set and the fault voltage of each <b>monitoring</b> <b>bus</b> is calculated. The voltage dip calculation results and the fault line data are matched to form the learning samples and then train the designed fault line recognition BP artificial neural network. The trained neural network searches the fault line when actual fault occurs. After it finishes fault line searching the fault position is calculated using the function of voltage dip amplitude and fault position. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method is proved by the simulation results in standard IEEE- 14 bus system...|$|E

40|$|International Conference on Digital Information {{management}} (ICDIM 2016). 19 to 21, Sep, 2016. Porto, Portugal. Wireless {{technology is}} expanding to areas previously reluctant {{to the use}} of this type of technology. In the aeronautics industry, wireless has recently gained preference for on-board systems that conventionally used only cables. Recent interference and reliability studies with state-of-the-art standards suggest the feasibility of a relatively new research area that has been called wireless avionics intra-communications (WAICs). This paper presents a non-exhaustive survey of efforts in this emerging area. The objective is to identify topics, design issues, and synergies with other fields. The design of WAICs resembles some aspects of networks on ground, but it also adds some particular issues that remain to be addressed. This paper attempts to identify design issues of WAICs that range from physical-layer to application and security layers. Structure health <b>monitoring,</b> <b>bus</b> communications, and cable replacement, are examples of applications of WAICs. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the role that {{customer}} satisfaction expressed as a CSQI can play in the benchmarking of operator performance as part of <b>monitoring</b> <b>bus</b> contract outcomes by the funder. Whilst this paper provides evidence for the bus industry, {{there is no reason}} to believe that the conclusions would differ for other public transport modes. In Hensher [13] we investigated the relationship between cost efficiency and CSQI elements under the control of the operator, and concluded that operators who provide services levels that result is a higher CSQI in general are also the more cost efficient, and that investing in higher levels of customer service does not have to necessarily require a great cost outlay. In the current paper we are focussing only on the development of a CSQI, providing details of how this can be obtained and used in a benchmarking context for regulators interested in both annual reviews of incumbent operators as well as for competitive tendering or negotiation (and re-negotiation) on contracts. The inclusion of CSQI in the performance review means that benchmarking becomes are much more valued process than simply one based on cost efficiency which is commonly mistaken as the same as cost reduction or no cost escalation (beyond inflation and other agreed variations).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For {{distributed}} systems, {{the ability}} to accurately <b>monitor</b> the <b>bus</b> traffic is {{required in order to}} enable fault removal and fault forecasting for system verification, enhancement and evaluation. Typically, modern communication systems have high data throughput, and <b>monitoring</b> the <b>bus</b> for hours produces large amounts of data at high rates. In the expected operating environment of the monitoring tool, non-volatile memories are often mandatory as data storage. The required frequent access to these memories, however, results in high processor load. To that aim, this paper presents an approach that illustrates the improvements that can be achieved when several memory access functionalities are transferred from software to hardware. To quantify the results, the different approaches implemented in an FPGA were subjected to an experimental evaluation. ...|$|R
