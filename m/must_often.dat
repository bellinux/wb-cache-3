5|$|Episode Two {{featured}} a new Hunter enemy, which {{had just been}} seen briefly in a recorded message in Episode One. The Hunter serves {{as one of the}} most dangerous enemies within the game and as means of emotional development for Alyx Vance. The Hunter is a powerful and resilient enemy which players <b>must</b> <b>often</b> run from while seeking a means to fight back; Episode Twos environments are designed with this in mind.|$|E
5|$|Beetle fossils are {{abundant}} in the Cenozoic; by the Quaternary (up to 1.6 mya), fossil species are identical to living ones, while from the Late Miocene (5.7 mya) the fossils are still so close to modern forms that they are most likely the ancestors of living species. The large oscillations in climate during the Quaternary caused beetles to change their geographic distributions so much that current location gives little clue to the biogeographical history of a species. It is evident that geographic isolation of populations <b>must</b> <b>often</b> have been broken as insects moved {{under the influence of}} changing climate, causing mixing of gene pools, rapid evolution, and extinctions, especially in middle latitudes.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil is a {{survival}} horror game where the player controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} the environment. To advance through the game, the player must explore a mansion and its surrounding areas while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating monsters like zombies, undead dogs, and giant spiders. The player can open doors, push certain objects, climb obstacles, and pick up items. When an item is collected, it is stored in an inventory that the player can access at any time. Items in the inventory can be used, examined, and combined to solve puzzles and gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible. The inventory is limited to a certain number of slots, and the player <b>must</b> <b>often</b> move items from the inventory to storage boxes located in certain areas to manage space.|$|E

5|$|The CAMS {{attack in}} set patterns, and their next moves are {{indicated}} by visual and aural cues. The player avoids these attacks via evasive spins, rolls and other maneuvers. Vanessa cannot move while attacking, {{and so the}} player <b>must</b> <b>often</b> use the environment as cover. Defeated enemies sometimes drop items that replenish health and energy or that trigger a combo timer, which multiplies the points earned from enemies destroyed consecutively. Each mission {{takes place in a}} series of rooms that contain a fixed number of enemies and may include a boss robot. At the end of a mission, the player receives a score {{based on the number of}} rooms explored and enemies destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{levels in}} And Yet It Moves are {{designed}} such that spinning {{the world at}} certain moments is required to progress. Because the character will tear into pieces if he falls from too high a distance, the player <b>must</b> <b>often</b> spin the world such that the character can safely surmount or descend from large obstacles. Other hazards such as wild beasts, fire and boulders, or falling into the black void that borders the playing field will tear the character. However, the player has unlimited lives and will reappear at the last checkpoint he passed prior to being torn.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} {{use a variety of}} {{firearms}} to defeat enemies, ranging from pistols to a rocket launcher. Aside from enemies, parts of the environment, such as explosive barrels, can be targeted and shot at, causing them to explode and damage nearby enemies. The game also introduces the ability for players to dodge attacks or perform a quick 180 degree turn to evade enemies. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. Health is regained with first aid sprays, as well as herbs, which can be used separately or mixed together to increase their healing effect. The game also features an ammunition creation system that allows players to create new ammunition from different varieties of gunpowder. In addition to engaging in combat, the player <b>must</b> <b>often</b> solve puzzles that focus on logical and conceptual challenges.|$|E

5|$|Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is a {{survival}} horror game where the player controls the protagonist Jill Valentine from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} the environment and enemies. Aside from Jill, the player takes control of another character for a brief portion of the game. To advance through the game, the player has to explore a city while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating various types of enemies. The player can interact with the environment in several ways, such as opening doors, pushing objects or climbing obstacles. Scattered throughout the city are weapons, ammunition and other items, which can be collected and put in the player's inventory. Items can be examined, used, or combined with others. The inventory is limited to a certain number of slots, and the player <b>must</b> <b>often</b> move items from the inventory to a storage box located in special rooms to manage space.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} {{of two major}} parallel dimensions, like time periods in Chrono Trigger, {{plays a significant role}} in the game. Players must go back and forth between the worlds to recruit party members, obtain items, and advance the plot. Much of the population of either world have counterparts in the other; some party members can even visit their other versions. The player <b>must</b> <b>often</b> search for items or places found exclusively in one world. Events in one dimension sometimes have an impact in another—for instance, cooling scorched ground on an island in one world allows vegetation to grow in the other world. This system assists the presentation of certain themes, including the questioning of the importance of one's past decisions and humanity's role in destroying the environment. Rounding out the notable facets of Chrono Crosss gameplay are the New Game+ option and multiple endings. As in Chrono Trigger, players who have completed the game may choose to start the game over using data from the previous session. Character levels, learned techniques, equipment, and items gathered copy over, while acquired money and some story-related items are discarded. On a New Game+, players can access twelve endings. Scenes viewed depend on players' progress in the game before the final battle, which can be fought at any time in a New Game+ file.|$|E
5|$|The player {{interacts with}} {{characters}} and objects by clicking on them. Clicking {{on the ground}} causes the player's selected characters to move. The gameplay, though in real-time, can be paused, whereupon commands may be issued to controllable characters, who will attempt to execute them when the game is unpaused. The game can also be set to pause automatically at certain times. Dialogue is started by NPCs at certain scripted times, or by the player's clicking on NPCs who are not immediately hostile. When speaking to an NPC, the player <b>must</b> <b>often</b> choose what to say {{from a list of}} responses. The dialogue may lead to quests or important information. When the player clicks on a hostile being, the currently selected characters will advance to attack it. Information about characters, creatures, items, and buildings in the game environment is shown on a tool tip, which appears when the mouse pointer is held over game elements.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there is}} an {{addressing}} system for the city, it is not widely used, causing problems in describing building locations. Directions <b>must</b> <b>often</b> be given based on nearby landmarks.|$|E
25|$|Like a writer, a photojournalist is a reporter, but {{he or she}} <b>must</b> <b>often</b> make {{decisions}} instantly and carry photographic equipment, often while exposed to significant obstacles (e.g., physical danger, weather, crowds, physical access).|$|E

25|$|Though non-parametric, L-estimators are {{frequently}} used for parameter estimation, {{as indicated by}} the name, though they <b>must</b> <b>often</b> be adjusted to yield an unbiased consistent estimator. The choice of L-estimator and adjustment depend on the distribution whose parameter is being estimated.|$|E
25|$|Markov {{chains are}} {{the basis for the}} {{analytical}} treatment of queues (queueing theory). Agner Krarup Erlang initiated the subject in 1917. This makes them critical for optimizing the performance of telecommunications networks, where messages <b>must</b> <b>often</b> compete for limited resources (such as bandwidth).|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{applications}} face many {{design challenges}} when considering exception handling strategies. Particularly in modern enterprise level applications, exceptions <b>must</b> <b>often</b> cross process boundaries and machine boundaries. Part of designing a solid exception handling strategy is recognizing when a process {{has failed to}} the point where it cannot be economically handled by the software portion of the process.|$|E
50|$|A {{functional}} specification (also, functional spec, specs, {{functional specification}}s document (FSD), functional requirements specification) in systems engineering and software {{development is a}} document that specifies the functions that a system or component <b>must</b> perform (<b>often</b> part of a requirements specification) (ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765-2010).|$|R

50|$|The {{orchestra}} has approximately 180 {{students and}} is {{split into two}} orchestras. Sinfonia and concert orchestra. Students interested in playing in Sinfonia <b>must</b> audition. <b>Often,</b> a handful of band members will play with the chamber orchestra at concerts. Concert Orchestra is the larger orchestra.|$|R
25|$|Commercial {{fishing is}} {{the capture of}} fish for {{commercial}} purposes. Those who practice it <b>must</b> <b>often</b> pursue fish far from land under adverse conditions. Commercial fishermen harvest almost all aquatic species, from tuna, cod and salmon to shrimp, krill, lobster, clams, squid and crab, in various fisheries for these species. Commercial fishing methods have become very efficient using large nets and sea-going processing factories. Individual fishing quotas and international treaties seek to control the species and quantities caught.|$|E
25|$|Pedestrians <b>must</b> <b>often</b> cross {{from one}} side of a road to the other, and in doing so may come into the way of {{vehicles}} traveling on the road. In many places pedestrians are entirely left to look after themselves, that is, they must observe the road and cross when they can see that no traffic will threaten them. Busier cities usually provide pedestrian crossings, which are strips of the road where pedestrians are expected to cross.|$|E
25|$|The arid {{topography}} of Israel has spurred Israeli scientists to develop innovative farming methods and desalination technologies. The start of an efficient desalination by Israeli scientists as planned {{will be a}} boost to many of Greece’s islands such as Santorini that suffer inadequate freshwater reserves and <b>must</b> <b>often</b> rely on shipped water. Agricultural Development and Foods Minister Athanassios Tsaftaris in a visit to Israel with Israeli Agriculture and Rural Development Minister Orit Noked in 2011 emphasised that both governments {{are very interested in}} further boosting agricultural development.|$|E
