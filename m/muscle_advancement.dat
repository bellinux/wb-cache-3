40|$|Upper airway {{analysis}} {{has become a}} key focus of investigation {{in the fields of}} Orthognathic Surgery and Orthodontics. This is due to the well-acknowledged relationship between a narrow upper airway and sleep-disordered breathing, and to the association between airway configuration and specific craniofacial phenotypes. As a result of the advancement of the skeletal insertions of the suprahyoid and velopharyngeal <b>muscles,</b> maxillomandibular <b>advancement</b> with counterclockwise rotation has established itself as an effective strategy to increase the pharyngeal airway volume, with subsequent improvement in sleep-disordered breathing symptomatology. These changes can be assessed objectively with cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT), which has provided a paradigm shift in cranio-maxillofacial imaging due to its capacity to obtain a thorough two- and three-dimensional evaluation of the upper airway at relatively modest costs, with greater accessibility, lower radiation, and shorter scanning times. The most important contributions of this PhD Thesis are the following: 1) Paper one provides the first systematic review of the literature concerning upper airway imaging and analysis with CBCT. Results confirm that CBCT is indeed an accurate and reliable tool for upper airway analysis. Nevertheless, specific problems related to the image acquisition process and to image processing and analysis persist. 2) Paper two is a preliminary CBCT evaluation of the effect of mono- and bimaxillary advancement on the volume of the upper airway. Results showed a systematic volumetric increase for all groups. However, bimaxillary and mandibular advancement achieved a greater percentage increase than maxillary advancement alone. These results suggest the influence of mandibular advancement on the posterior airway space’s dimensions is greater than the effect of the forward movement of the maxilla. 3) Based on the results of the previous two papers, paper three was aimed at providing clinical three-dimensional anatomical limits for the upper airway subregions, translating them into accurate and reliable cephalometric landmarks in CBCT data, and validating the proposed measuring protocol. Our proposed protocol for upper airway subregion analysis proved to be anatomically logical, technically feasible, and statistically reliable...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} on human muscle autopsies, from triceps of the left arm, obtained from 23 non-athletic built males, with no evidence of neuromuscular involvement. Their age covered the range from one month to 81 years. They were divided into four groups according to their age namely, the infant, the child, the adult and the elderly groups. The autopsy specimens were processed for light and transmission electron microscopical study. As for light microscopy, they were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin and Masson trichrome staining methods. An image analysis study was included to estimate the mean cross sectional area of the muscle fiber, the mean area percent of the fibrocollagenous septa enclosed between the muscle bundles and the mean satellite cell counts. The study revealed the presence of considerable variations in the histological structure of the skeletal <b>muscle</b> with the <b>advancement</b> of age. The cross sectional area of the skeletal muscle fiber reached its peak value in the adult group followed by marked regression in the elderly group. An expected continuous spectrum of growth and maturation was observed in the fibrocollagenous septa between the muscle bundles. These septa became densely packed and irregular in the elderly age group. The maximum number of satellite cells was observed in the child group followed by {{a decline in the}} adult group to become scarce and pyknotic in the elderly one. Ultrastructurally, in senescent individuals, the sarcolemma appeared irregular, with irregular arrangement of the dark and light bands and the mitochondrial aggregates appeared ballooned and degenerated. These observations could suggest that muscle atrophy is a major contributor to the decrease in muscle strength manifesting with advancement of age...|$|R

40|$|Priscilla Xinhui Wang, Victor Teck Chang Koh, Jin Fong ChengDepartment of Ophthalmology, National University Health System, SingaporeAbstract: Topical Bimatoprost is {{a common}} and popular {{prostaglandin}} analog used as an ocular hypotensive agent {{in the treatment of}} glaucoma. Side effects include ocular hyperaemia, ocular pruritus, and periocular and iris pigmentary changes. Perioribital lipodystrophy is another well-documented outcome associated with chronic use of topical bimatoprost, which results in periorbital hallowing, upper eyelid sulcus deepening, eyelid retraction and enophthalmos. We report an unusual case of periocular muscle atrophy and weakness from unilateral topical bimatoprost use. Our patient had primary angle closure and experienced a right upper eyelid ptosis 2 months after she started to use topical bimatoprost in that eye. Clinical measurements of her eyelids clearly showed reduction in the function of her right levator muscle, suggesting that effects of topical bimatoprost may not be limited to periorbital fat. She was advised to stop topical bimatoprost and right ptosis correction surgery with levator <b>muscle</b> <b>advancement</b> was performed successfully. Ophthalmologists and patients should be aware of this potential rare side effect of topical bimatoprost, as it may be potentially disfiguring, especially with monocular use.

40|$|ObjectivesOptimal {{management}} of poststernotomy mediastinitis is controversial. Negative pressure wound treatment improves wound environment and sternal stability with low surgical invasiveness. Our protocol {{was based on}} negative pressure followed by delayed surgical closure. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide the results at early follow-up and to identify the risk factors for adverse outcome. MethodsIn 5400 cardiac procedures, 44 consecutive patients with mediastinitis were enrolled in the study. Mediastinitis treatment was based on urgent debridement and negative pressure as the first-line approach. After wound sterilization, chest closure was achieved by elective pectoralis <b>muscle</b> <b>advancement</b> flap. Each patient's hospital data were collected prospectively. Variables included patient demographics and clinical and biological data. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score was calculated at the time of diagnosis and 48 hours after debridement. Focus outcome measures were mediastinitis-related death and need for reintervention after pectoralis muscle closure. ResultsEl Oakley type I and type IIIA mediastinitis were the most frequent types (63. 6 %). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was present in 25 patients (56. 8 %). Mean APACHE II score was 19. 4 ± 4 at the time of diagnosis, and 30 patients (68. 2 %) required intensive care unit transfer before surgical debridement. APACHE II score improved 48 hours after wound debridement and negative pressure application (mean value, 19. 4 ± 4 vs 7. 2 ± 2; P = . 005) independently of any other variables included in the study. One patient in septic shock at the time of diagnosis died (2. 2 %).

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the clinical course {{in patients who}} underwent surgical correction of consecutive esotropia. Methods: The medical records of 13 patients who underwent surgical correction of consecutive esotropia were reviewed retrospectively. The authors investigated the deviation and surgical method {{at the time of}} exotropia surgery. During the follow up period, the authors also studied incidence of amblyopia development, the effect of occlusion therapy, surgical methods for consecutive esotropia, and postoperative change of deviation. Results: The average exodeviation was 27. 1 prism diopter (PD). Bilateral lateral rectus muscle recession was performed in all patients. In all patients, alternate occlusion was tried from 2 weeks after development of consecutive esotropia. However, there was no effect on 7 patients. None of the patients developed amblyopia. Surgery for consecutive esotropia was performed on the average 15. 3 months after exotropia surgery. The average esodeviation was 21. 1 PD. Medial rectus muscle recession was performed in 10 patients and lateral rectus <b>muscle</b> <b>advancement</b> in 3 patients. The average deviation of the subject group immediately after surgery was 1. 2 PD esodeviation, 0. 9 PD esodeviation one month after surgery, 2. 4 PD exodeviation 6 months after surgery, and 4. 7 PD exodeviation at the last follow up, and it showed a tendency to progress to exodeviation as the follow up period increased. Ten patients (76. 9 %) showed deviation within 8 PD at the last follow up. Conclusions: The success rate of surgical correction for consecutive esotropia was a favorable outcome. But, careful decisions of the surgical method and amount is needed because the conversion of exodeviation during long-term follow-up is possible...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Recurrent patellar dislocations {{are common}} {{injuries}} {{in children and}} adolescents. The subjective and functional results of soft tissue surgical management in a skeletally immature population {{at the time of}} surgery have not been reported. This prospective cohort study evaluates clinically and functionally a selected group of skeletally immature individuals patients who underwent the 3 -in- 1 procedure for chronic patellar instability. Hypothesis The 3 -in- 1 procedure is an effective treatment for recurrent patellar dislocation in skeletally immature patients. Materials and Methods: Twenty-five skeletally immature patients (age at operation, 13. 5 ± 3. 8 years), without any anatomic predisposing factors, who were practicing sports and suffering from recurrent unilateral patellar dislocation were included in the study and followed until skeletal maturation. The 3 -in- 1 procedure is an extensor mechanism realignment of the knee combining lateral release, vastus medialis obliquus <b>muscle</b> <b>advancement,</b> and transfer of the medial third of the patellar tendon to the medial collateral ligament. The patients were regularly followed-up postoperatively at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks, and then annually. Evaluation included the modified Cincinnati and the Kujala scores, anthropometry, plain radiography, and isokinetic dynamometry. Results: The average follow-up was 3. 8 years (range, 2. 5 - 6 years). The mean modified Cincinnati score increased from 51. 7 ± 12. 6 preoperatively to 94. 3 ± 10. 8 (P <. 02), while the mean Kujala scores increased from 52. 4 ± 12. 7 preoperatively to 93. 8 ± 14. 2 (P <. 02). The muscle volume of the thigh of the operated limb increased with time, but remained significantly less well developed than the muscle volume of the thigh of the nonoperated limb (P =. 03). The Insall-Salvati index remained essentially unchanged, being 1. 04 ± 0. 2 preoperatively and 1. 02 ± 0. 3 at latest follow-up. Significant {{differences were found between the}} operated and the contralateral limb in the various isokinetic strength variables at all angular velocities measured at the latest follow-up (. 05 < P <. 0042). Only 1 patient suffered a patellar redislocation from a high-energy motorcycle trauma 3 years after the index procedure. Conclusions: The 3 -in- 1 procedure is a safe, reliable management option for recurrent patellar dislocation in skeletally immature patients. Our follow-up of a minimum of 2. 5 years and until skeletal maturation is long enough to consider that the results of surgery had stabilized. In a prospective randomized study, Palmu et al. observed that most of the first redislocations occurred within 2 years after surgery, and most patients with a redislocation had more than 1 redislocation. Side-to-side differences in isokinetic strength and in anthropometric indices persist despite subjective success of the procedure. It is possible that heavy resistance training may have to be implemented to overcome these findings. Correct indications and a careful preoperative evaluation are of fundamental importance for successful long-term outcome. The 3 -in- 1 procedure does not preclude further surgical stabilization, as do the Elmslie-Trillat procedure or reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament, when failure occurs after skeletal maturity. Long-term evaluation is necessary, particularly to monitor the possible development of patellofemoral osteoarthritis...|$|E
