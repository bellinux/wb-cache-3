PCMs are the substances which can store or release a large amount of energy in the form of latent heat at certain melting temperature. This research reports practical and theoretical studies of textiles containing PCMs. Mono and multifilament filaments incorporated with microencapsulated phase change material (MPCM) have been developed through melt spinning process. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) have been performed for the characterisation of MPCM polypropylene filaments. The parameters for optimum fibre processing and their effect on mechanical properties of filaments with respect to the amount of MPCM have also been studied. A plain woven fabric has been constructed using the developed MPCM <b>multifilament</b> <b>yarn.</b> The heat transfer property of the <b>multifilament</b> <b>yarn</b> and fabric has been investigated using finite element method. The time dependent thermoregulating effect of yarn and fabric incorporated with MPCM has also been predicted according to the validated models.

30|$|It can be {{seen that}} the take-up speed {{affected}} the final shape of the braid. The higher υtu, the lower the braid angle. However, when using only one cylinder to model a <b>multifilament</b> <b>yarn,</b> it appears that α was only slightly affected by the take-up speed. Although the difference in braid angle between model “E/ 1 ” and the real braid was negligible, the difference in α for the lowest take-up speed was as high as 23.3 ∘. Increasing the number of cylinders from one to three, an improved correlation was seen between the simulations and the experimental results. For the smallest υtu, the braid angle determined for model “A/ 3 ” was 25.43 ∘. Although the difference in braid angle between the virtual and the real braid was as high as 13.67 ∘, a noticeable improvement with respect to the previous case was achieved as far as the braid angle is concerned. Increasing the take-up speed, the difference between the calculated braid angle for virtual braids and the braid angle of a real braid decreased. On the other hand, it must be emphasised that the running time of X/ 3 simulations was more than double the time required to complete the X/ 1 simulations (23 h compared to 51 h). Increasing the number of cylinders used to model a <b>multifilament</b> <b>yarn</b> to seven, the computational time increased to 113 h. Although the use of seven cylinders to model the real yarn did not lead to a significant difference in terms of braid angle with respect to the previous X/ 1 and X/ 3 models for high take-up speeds, a better correlation between the simulations and the experimental results was found for small υtu. The difference in the braid angle between the virtual and the real braid was as low as 7.54 ∘ for υtu= 63 mm/min. The apparent irregular braid shapes for models X/ 7 are due solely to the bad rendering of the prisms shaped around the beam elements (Fig.  8 c).|$|E

Moreover, this technique can be employed for the creation of virtual braids with different materials if realistic material properties are used.
