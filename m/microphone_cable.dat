500|$|The One Hot Minute tour began {{several days}} {{after the release of}} the album. The band opened the tour with a European leg. Kiedis felt that as a musician, he was {{becoming}} somewhat lackluster. The short European leg ended in early November, and the U.S. portion was scheduled to begin 10 days later; however, it was postponed until early February. A few shows into the commencement of the U.S. leg, Kiedis badly injured his leg while engaging in what he calls [...] "eyes-closed robotic dancing". He tripped over a monitor and fell off the stage, ending up hanging by his calf from his <b>microphone</b> <b>cable,</b> resulting in a cast which he wore for the next two months. Kiedis reflected that it [...] "was nice to see that people were still interested in coming out to see what we do", as there had been a four-year gap since the release of Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Following the conclusion of the U.S. tour, the Chili Peppers took two weeks off before several Australia and New Zealand performances. The band then played at the Tibetan Freedom Concert in San Francisco, before finishing the tour in Europe.|$|E
500|$|The Who changed {{managers}} to Peter Meaden. He {{decided that the}} group would be ideal to represent the growing mod movement in Britain which involved fashion, scooters and music genres such as rhythm and blues, soul and beat. He renamed the group the High Numbers, dressed them up in mod clothes, secured a second, more favourable audition with Fontana and wrote the lyrics for both sides of their single [...] "Zoot Suit"/"I'm the Face" [...] to appeal to mods. The tune for [...] "Zoot Suit" [...] was [...] "Misery" [...] by the Dynamics, and [...] "I'm the Face" [...] borrowed from Slim Harpo's [...] "I Got Love If You Want It". Although Meaden tried to promote the single, it failed {{to reach the top}} 50 and the band reverted to calling themselves the Who. The group began to improve their stage image; Daltrey started using his <b>microphone</b> <b>cable</b> as a whip on stage, and occasionally leapt into the crowd; Moon threw drumsticks into the air mid-beat; Townshend mimed machine gunning the crowd with his guitar while jumping on stage and playing guitar with a fast arm-windmilling motion, or stood with his arms aloft allowing his guitar to produce feedback in a posture dubbed [...] "the Bird Man".|$|E

50|$|Portable intercoms are {{connected}} primarily using common shielded, twisted pair <b>microphone</b> <b>cabling</b> terminated with 3-pin XLR connectors. Building and vehicle intercoms {{are connected}} {{in a similar}} manner with shielded cabling often containing more than one twisted pair.|$|R
2500|$|At a later time, {{ranging from}} {{weeks or months}} later to even years later, the dry, direct, {{unprocessed}} guitar recording {{is fed to a}} bridging device (a Reamp unit or reverse DI box) to [...] "re-record" [...] the guitarist's unprocessed performance through a dedicated guitar amplifier cabinet and/or external effects units. The guitar amplifier is placed in the live room or isolation booth of the recording studio and is set up to produce the desired tonal quality, including distortion character and room reverberation. A microphone is placed near the guitar speaker and a new track is recorded, producing the re-amplified, processed track. The <b>microphone</b> <b>cable</b> is connected to the mixing console or mic preamp using a cable, as usual, without using a bridging device.|$|E
50|$|Some poles have a <b>microphone</b> <b>cable</b> {{routed through}} {{the inside of}} the pole, which may be a regular cable {{protruding}} at the bottom end, or a coiled cable that can extend with the pole, connecting to a socket at the base into which the operator plugs the <b>microphone</b> <b>cable.</b> The ideal boom pole is lightweight and strong, supporting the weight of the microphone on the end while adding as little weight as possible.|$|E

Euphemisms including the connecting of <b>microphone</b> <b>cables,</b> spilling of milk are subtly woven into both versions of the video, and they conclude with Luciana dousing the room with petrol and sparking a cigarette lighter.|$|R
50|$|Phantom power, in {{the context}} of {{professional}} audio equipment, is DC electric power transmitted through <b>microphone</b> <b>cables</b> to operate <b>microphones</b> that contain active electronic circuitry.It is best known as a convenient power source for condenser microphones, though many active direct boxes also use it. The technique is also used in other applications where power supply and signal communication take place over the same wires.|$|R
50|$|The {{combined}} {{benefits of}} twisting, balanced signalling, and quadrupole pattern give outstanding noise immunity, especially advantageous for low signal level {{applications such as}} <b>microphone</b> <b>cables,</b> even when installed very close to a power cable. The disadvantage is that star quad, in combining two conductors, typically has double the capacitance of similar two-conductor twisted and shielded audio cable. High capacitance causes increasing distortion and greater loss of high frequencies as distance increases.|$|R
50|$|Mārtiņš Saulespurēns (born 1943) is {{an audio}} {{engineer}} who co-founded Blue Microphones with musician Skipper Wise. Saulespurēns also developed the tunable capsule for contemporary microphone design and invented the Champagne <b>Microphone</b> <b>Cable.</b>|$|E

50|$|While {{the above}} {{discussion}} focuses on preventing noise from getting in (e.g. into a <b>microphone</b> <b>cable)</b> the same star-quad quadrupole configuration {{is useful for}} audio speaker cable, for split-phase electric power wiring, and even for open-wire star quad transmission line.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} standards, frequencies and transmission technologies used to replace the <b>microphone's</b> <b>cable</b> connection and {{make it into a}} wireless microphone.They can transmit, for example, in radio waves using UHF or VHF frequencies, FM, AM, or various digital modulation schemes. Some low cost (or specialist) models use infrared light. Infrared microphones require a direct line of sight between the microphone and the receiver, while costlier radio frequency models do not.|$|R

5000|$|A {{variety of}} cables {{are used to}} carry {{electrical}} signals in sound recording studios and with electronic or electrical musical instruments. Microphones are typically connected to mixing boards or PA systems with XLR <b>microphone</b> <b>cables</b> which use three-pin XLR connectors. A huge range of electric or electronic instruments use 1/4 inch mono patch cords to connect the instrument to the amplifier, such as the electric guitar, electric bass, synthesizer, electric piano, or electronic drum machine. Musicians playing electric or electronic instruments often use longer cables (from 10 to 20 feet) between their instrument and their amplifier, and then use shorter patch cords (from a few inches {{to one or two}} feet long) to connect chains of effects devices, [...] "stomp box" [...] pedals, or other signal processors.|$|R
50|$|For short cable runs of {{less than}} about 45 m {{with only a few}} devices, it is {{sometimes}} possible to operate without termination. At short distances, cables with higher capacitance and different characteristic impedance such as <b>microphone</b> <b>cable</b> can be used. As the cable length and/or number of devices increases however, following the specification for termination and correct cable impedance becomes more important.|$|E
50|$|Saulespurēns, in {{collaboration}} with Blue, developed the first <b>microphone</b> <b>cable</b> to pass both power and the audio signal in a single cable without extensive audio signal degradation. To {{eliminate the need for}} two cable connections in a tube microphone - power supply and audio signal - he combined two pairs of conductors twisted to eliminate noise and then covered with a fine-tinned copper braid for additional protection.|$|E

50|$|Many {{microphones}} {{operate at}} low voltage levels and some with high output impedance (hi-Z), which makes long <b>microphone</b> <b>cables</b> especially susceptible to electromagnetic interference. Microphone interconnections are therefore {{a common application}} for a balanced interconnection, which cancels out most of this induced noise. If the power amplifiers of a public address system are located at any distance from the mixing console, it is also normal to use balanced lines for the signal paths from the mixer to these amplifiers. Many other components, such as graphic equalizers and effects units, have balanced inputs and outputs to allow this. In recording and for short cable runs in general, a compromise is necessary between the noise reduction given by balanced lines and the cost introduced by the extra circuitry they require.|$|R
5000|$|A {{patch cable}} or patch cord or patch lead is an {{electrical}} or optical cable used to connect ("patch in") one electronic or optical device to another for signal routing. Devices {{of different types}} (e.g., a switch connected to a computer, or a switch to a router) are connected with patch cords. Patch cords are usually produced in many different colors {{so as to be}} easily distinguishable, and are relatively short, perhaps no longer than two metres. Types of patch cords include <b>microphone</b> <b>cables,</b> headphone extension cables, XLR connector, Tiny Telephone (TT) connector, RCA connector and ¼" [...] TRS phone connector cables (as well as modular Ethernet cables), and thicker, hose-like cords (snake cable) used to carry video or amplified signals. However, patch cords typically refer only to short cords used with patch panels.|$|R
50|$|When star-quad {{cable is}} used for a single {{balanced}} line, such as professional audio applications and two-wire telephony, two non-adjacent conductors are terminated together {{at both ends of}} the cable, and the other two conductors are also terminated together. Interference picked up by the cable arrives as a virtually perfect common mode signal, which is easily removed by a coupling transformer or differential amplifier. The combined benefits of twisting, differential signalling, and quadrupole pattern give outstanding noise immunity, especially advantageous for low signal level applications such as long <b>microphone</b> <b>cables,</b> even when installed very close to a power cable. It is particularly beneficial compared to twisted pair when AC magnetic field sources are in close proximity, for example a stage cable that can lie against an inline power transformer.|$|R
5000|$|The last episode {{featured}} Bolan duetting {{with his}} friend David Bowie. Before the song had reached its end, Bolan tripped over a <b>microphone</b> <b>cable</b> and fell off the stage. Bowie {{is said to have}} called out [...] "Could we have a wooden box for Marc stand on?". Following the show Bolan and Bowie co-wrote and recorded a rough outline of a new song, 'Madman'. The new wave band Cuddly Toys found a bootleg tape and recorded it, which became a UK Indie Chart single and featured on their 'Guillotine Theatre' album.|$|E
50|$|In these cases, {{the purpose}} of the star quad {{configuration}} is reversed. The star-quad geometry cancels the magnetic fields that are produced by the two pairs of conductors. This cancellation reduces the magnetic emissions of the cable. To work properly, the cable must be wired in the same fashion as the <b>microphone</b> <b>cable</b> example above. Wires {{on opposite sides of the}} star must be shorted together at each end of the cable. This means that 4 conductors are required for a two-wire circuit. Furthermore, this scheme only works if the two pairs of conductors carry equal and opposite currents.|$|E
50|$|Phantom {{powering}} {{consists of}} a phantom circuit where direct current is applied equally through the two signal lines of a balanced audio connector (in modern equipment, usually an XLR connector). The supply voltage is referenced to the ground pin of the connector (pin 1 of an XLR), which normally {{is connected to the}} cable shield or a ground wire in the cable or both. When phantom powering was introduced, one of its advantages was that the same type of balanced, shielded <b>microphone</b> <b>cable</b> that studios were already using for dynamic microphones could be used for condenser microphones. This is in contrast to microphones with vacuum-tube circuitry, most of which require special, multi-conductor cables.|$|E
5000|$|Marković's {{political}} views {{tended to be}} hard-line Communist. Although she often claimed that she agreed with her husband on everything, Slobodan {{seems to have had}} fewer authoritarian tendencies than Mira. [...] Mira reportedly had little respect for the Bosnian Serb leaders. Vojislav Šešelj appeared before a court on 18 June 1994 to face charges of breaking <b>microphone</b> <b>cables</b> in Parliament. He read a statement, saying, [...] "Mr. Judge, all I can say in my defense is that Milošević is Serbia's biggest criminal." [...] Marković replied by calling Šešelj a [...] "primitive Turk who is afraid to fight like a man, and instead sits around insulting other people's wives." [...] Karadžić was apparently unable to telephone Milosević, because Mira would not tolerate his calls. She claimed also to be a feminist.|$|R

50|$|There is {{a common}} belief that {{connecting}} a dynamic or ribbon microphone to a phantom-powered input will damage it. There are three possibilities for this damage to occur. If there is a fault in the cable, phantom power may damage some mics by applying a voltage across {{the output of the}} microphone. Equipment damage is also possible if a phantom-powered input connected to an unbalanced dynamic microphone or electronic musical instruments. The transient generated when a microphone is hot-plugged into an input with active phantom power can damage the microphone and possibly the preamp circuit of the input because not all pins of the microphone connector make contact at the same time, and there is an instant when current can flow to charge the capacitance of the cable {{from one side of the}} phantom-powered input and not the other. This is particularly a problem with long <b>microphone</b> <b>cables.</b> It is considered good practice to disable phantom power to devices that don't require it.|$|R

5000|$|Hindalong's {{family life}} {{is once again}} {{the subject of much}} of the rest of the album. [...] "I Don't Mean Any Harm" [...] is written as an apology to his wife and kids, while [...] "A Moment in Time" [...] is about Hindalong's first date with his wife, Nancy. [...] "Shiny Floor" [...] is a metaphorical song about the band's fractious {{relationship}} to the music industry, based on real incidents in which Hindalong spilled a drink on a friend's kitchen floor, then tripped over a <b>microphone</b> <b>cable</b> in the studio a few days later. Finally, Chandler added a track of his very own, [...] "Sunny," [...] which attempts to find hope in even the most tragic of events—an ongoing, trademark theme of The Choir.|$|E
5000|$|Kimball {{was born}} in Salt Lake City in 1910, the son of Edward Partridge Kimball. In 1929, when [...] "Music and the Spoken Word" [...] began radio {{broadcast}}ing, Kimball was the 19-year-old son of the choir's organist. For the first broadcast a long <b>microphone</b> <b>cable</b> stretched over {{a block from the}} KDYL radio station (KSL's predecessor) to the Salt Lake Tabernacle. With the station's only microphone suspended from the Tabernacle ceiling, Ted Kimball announced each song while standing on a ladder during the whole show. After only eleven months, Kimball was replaced by Richard L. Evans, who is considered the first regular narrator and voice of the show. Evans expanded the narrations to include inspirational thoughts, called [...] "sermonettes", and stayed with the show for 41 years.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout the series, Burton was {{equipped}} with Geordi La Forge's trademark VISOR, which he found extremely unpleasant to wear: [...] "It’s pretty much a living hell... 85 to 90% of my vision is taken away when the VISOR goes on... I bumped into everything the first season-Light stands, overhead <b>microphones,</b> <b>cables</b> at my feet-I tripped over it all... So it’s a sort of conundrum - the blind man, who puts on the VISOR and sees much more than everyone else around him, when the actor actually does that he’s turned into a blind person. Then there was the pain. In the second season, we re-designed the VISOR and made it heavier {{and the way we}} actually affixed it was that we screwed it, we literally screwed it into my head and so there were screws that we would turn and there were flanges on the inside that would press into my temples and so after fifteen or twenty minutes of that I got headaches. So I had a daily headache for about six years. Which was also no fun." ...|$|R

5000|$|Usually, non-anamorphic 4-perf {{films are}} filmed {{directly}} on the entire full frame silent aperture gate (1.33:1). When a married print is created, this frame is slightly re-cropped by the frame line and optical soundtrack down to Academy ratio (1.37:1). The movie projector then uses an aperture mask to soft matte the Academy frame to the intended aspect ratio (1.85:1 or 1.66:1). When the 4:3 fullscreen video master is created, many filmmakers may prefer to use the full Academy frame ("open matte") instead of creating a pan and scan version from within the 1.85 framing. Because the framing is increased vertically in the open matte process, {{the decision to use}} it needs to be made prior to shooting, so that the camera operator can frame for 1.85:1 and [...] "protect" [...] for 4:3; otherwise unintended objects such as boom <b>microphones,</b> <b>cables,</b> and light stands may appear in the open matte frame, thus requiring some amount of pan and scan in some or all scenes. Additionally, the unmatted 4:3 version will often throw off an otherwise tightly-framed shot and add an inordinate amount of headroom above actors (particularly with 1.85:1).|$|R
