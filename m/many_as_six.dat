5|$|The {{film was}} shot in Bagnoregio, Viterbo, Lazio, and Ovindoli, L'Aquila, Abruzzo.

5|$|In {{addition}} to judicial affairs, Chesney worked to ensure {{good relations with}} his cathedral chapter, and allowed them exemptions from episcopal jurisdiction. He also permitted the clergy of his diocese to remit the payment of chrism money and forwent the traditional annual payment from the archdeacons of the diocese to the bishop. He suppressed unlicensed schools in Huntingdon and employed a number of educated clerks; his acta almost always include one witness entitled magister, and often as <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>six.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rome had {{no central}} bank, and {{regulation}} of the banking system was minimal. Banks of classical antiquity typically kept less in reserves than the full total of customers' deposits. A typical bank had fairly limited capital, and often only one principal, though a bank might have as <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>six</b> to fifteen principals. Seneca assumes that anyone involved in commerce needs access to credit.|$|E

5|$|Strict Sabbatarianism {{was vital}} to Presbyterian culture. For members of separatist churches, the Sunday {{walk to the}} meeting house, {{sometimes}} as much as thirty miles, marked the intensity of dissent and strict keeping of the Sabbath was a mark of true membership. Fast days were also important, particularly in Seeder culture. They often did not involve actual fasting, but focused on stricter observance of the Sabbath. The established kirk had three a year, but the seeders as <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>six.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{game had}} {{more than three million}} players around the world by 1981, and copies of the rules were selling {{at a rate of about}} 750,000 per year by 1984. Beginning with a French {{language}} edition in 1982, Dungeons & Dragons has been translated into many languages beyond the original English. By 2004, consumers had spent more than US$1billion on Dungeons & Dragons products and the game had been played by more than 20million people.

5|$|Around 52 {{minutes and}} 47 seconds into the film, when Shatner {{is talking about}} the other Original Series actors disliking him, he shifts in his chair and a sound evocative of {{flatulence}} is audible. This sound, apparently unnoticed by the filmmakers, was first mentioned in the media by Adam Buckman in the New York Post on October 10, 2001. Buckman wrote that he played the sound for more than six colleagues who all agreed that it came from Shatner. This scene became a popular subject of flatulence humor among Star Trek fans and on morning zoo radio programs. Reviewers identified as <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>six</b> other similar noises in Mind Meld, between the 52-minute mark and the end.|$|E

If care is taken in not disturbing the nest, this method can be repeated yearly.|$|R

5|$|Bowie {{performed}} {{several of}} the album's songs during a press tour that preceded his highly theatrical Glass Spider Tour, which played to a combined audience of as <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>six</b> million fans. Bowie wanted to produce a live show that picked up where his aborted 1974 Diamond Dogs Tour left off. Although considered financially successful and well attended, the tour itself was critically dismissed. Bowie designed his next few tours specifically to avoid the problems that the Glass Spider Tour was criticized for by avoiding overly theatrical stage presentations and focusing on his music. Despite the criticism, Bowie maintained that performing on this tour was the most fun he had had on tour {{up to that point}} in his career.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of each half-inning, the nine players on the fielding team arrange themselves around the field. One of them, the pitcher, stands on the pitcher's mound. The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. Another player, the catcher, squats {{on the far side of}} home plate, facing the pitcher. The rest of the team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders. In the standard arrangement, there is a first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base, a second baseman to the right of second base, a shortstop to the left of second base, and a third baseman to the right of third base. The basic outfield positions are left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder. With the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be in fair territory when the pitch is delivered. A neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher. Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well, though the number will vary depending on the level of play; amateur or children's games may only have an umpire behind the plate, while as <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>six</b> umpires can be used for important major league games.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy X-2 reintroduces the series' classic {{character}} class system (seen previously in Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy Tactics) through {{the inclusion of}} dresspheres. Because the party never grows beyond three characters, switching characters during battle is unnecessary. Instead, the player can switch {{character class}}es, providing access to different abilities. The playable characters are allowed to equip one dressphere at a time, each providing different battle functions and abilities. Characters can learn new skills for each dressphere {{with the use of}} Ability Points (AP). AP is obtained by defeating enemies and by the use of items and abilities for that sphere. Abilities to be learned are chosen in the main menu. During battle, AP is given to that ability until it is learned. Each character can access as <b>many</b> <b>as</b> <b>six</b> dresspheres at a time, depending on the specific properties of the Garment Grid they are wearing. The Garment Grid is a placard featuring a geometric shape connected by nodes. These nodes are slots that can be filled with dresspheres, allowing characters to change character classes during their turn in battle. Most Garment Grids possess Gates that when passed through grant the user a complimentary buff.|$|E

50|$|The {{bolt pattern}} determines {{the number and}} {{position}} of the mounting holes to allow the wheel to be bolted to the hub. As the bolts are evenly spaced, the number of bolts determines the pattern. For example: smaller cars have three (Citroën 2CV, Renault 4, some Peugeot 106s and Citroën Saxos). Compact cars may have four bolts. Most United States passenger cars have five bolts. Pickup trucks, large SUVs, and armored vehicles may have <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> five, <b>six,</b> eight, or ten. It is not unheard of to find vehicles with even more, such as enormous coal mining transporters that may have twelve.|$|R

In this report, we focus on the regulatory system, and practices laws and regulations. The main problem with the current management structure is the strong fragmentation.
