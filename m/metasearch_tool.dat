40|$|In March 2003 the University of Mississippi Libraries made our <b>MetaSearch</b> <b>tool</b> {{publicly}} available. After a year of {{working with}} this product and integrating it into the library Web site, {{a wide variety}} of libraries interested in our implementation process and experiences began to call.  Libraries interested in this product have included consortia, public, and academic libraries in the United States, Mexico, and Europe. This article was written in an effort to share the recommendations and concerns given. Much of the advice is general and could be applied to many of the MetaSearch tools available. Google Scholar and other open Web initiatives that could impact the future of MetaSearching are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Metasearch tools, which combine {{search results}} from {{any number of}} {{independent}} search engines, could be useful {{in a range of}} tasks and especially for integrating information from separate government agencies. However, it is not immediately clear what user interfaces might be appropriate for presenting results from more than one source. We evaluated four interface designs with real tasks from Centrelink, Australia’s social services agency, and with a working <b>metasearch</b> <b>tool.</b> Test users recorded similar overall effectiveness across these interfaces, but did not like the most familiar options, a single ranked list or a link to broaden search scope. Interfaces which supported identifying, understanding, and selecting between sources were strongly preferred...|$|E
40|$|Many current {{evaluation}} {{techniques for}} information retrieval, such as test collections and simulations, {{are difficult to}} apply in situations where queries and preferred results are context-dependent. This is particularly true in personal metasearch applications, which provide a person with unified search access to all their usual online sources. A recently-proposed technique, based on presenting two or more search results sets in a single comparison interface, offers an alternative. We have embedded this technique in a working personal <b>metasearch</b> <b>tool</b> which we have distributed to volunteers. Initial experiments with server selection suggest that the technique is accepted by users, can operate over diverse and unarticulated contexts, and that the data it provides can provide a useful comparison to that from test collections. Further experimentation with the technique is continuing. Themes: Case studies, field experiments, simulations, etc. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Owing to a {{progressive}} quantity {{of the document}} in the web, the user feels lost {{to find the most}} relevant information. The metasearch {{turns out to be a}} powerful way to help the user by combining several sources of information (search engine) into a single unifying <b>tool</b> (<b>metasearch</b> engine). However, the metasearch can face some obstacles and the most critical is the fusion and the rearrangement of search engine results. This paper presents a fusion approach based on the moderate voting system Borda, we see the fusion of results from different search engines as an election to elect a set of candidate documents in a certain order, and thus it defines the search engines as electorates. To properly apply the Borda Method, we need to know the popularity of each research engine (number of electors for each search engine), it represents the weight of the search engine to the query. This value heavily depends on the specific need of the user, so we can give a weight to each search engine relative to the user query according to his profile. We have evaluated our approach on the collection of TREC documents and we will present some experienced results...|$|R
40|$|When {{searching the}} web, a user strives to find useful documents. Web search engines {{have been shown}} to have {{relatively}} low coverage, as well as other problems, that limit their ability to return useful documents. One solution is use of a <b>metasearch</b> engine: a <b>tool</b> that sends user queries to multiple search engines and combines the results to increase coverage. Unfortunately, a metasearch engine also has problems, mostly {{due to the lack of}} direct control of the underlying search engines, that limit its ability to locate and identify useful results. To improve the ability of users to find useful results when searching the web, we present the architecture of a preference-based metasearch engine Inquirus 2, which utilizes explicit user pref-erences in the form of a category, such as “personal homepages ” or “research papers”. Inquirus 2 demonstrates five architectural improvements that enhance the ability to locate and identify useful documents, and to increase performance. The architectural improvements are: an incremental user interface, need-based source selection, source and category-specific query modification, selective downloading of results, and need-based scoring. A user study was performed to measure the effectiveness of the architectural components and to improve our understanding of user judgments of usefulness as related to topical relevance and document category. This user study demonstrated a bounding relation between the levels of user judgments of topical relevance and usefulness, as well as confirming the effectiveness of our archi-tecture. We also present the Query Modification Learning Procedure (QMLP), a procedure that auto-matically learns category-specific and source-specific query modifications, along with experimental results confirming the effectiveness of the procedure...|$|R
40|$|Motivations: Technological {{advances}} in biomedical research are generating {{a plethora of}} heterogeneous data at a high rate. There is a critical need for extraction, integration and management tools for information discovery and synthesis from these heterogeneous data. Results: In this paper, we present a general architecture, called ALFA, for information extraction and representation from diverse biological data. The ALFA architecture consists of: (i) a networked, hierarchical, hyper-graph object model for representing information from heterogeneous data sources in a standardized, structured format; and (ii) a suite of integrated, interactive software tools for information extraction and representation from diverse biological data sources. As part of our research efforts to explore this space, we have currently prototyped the ALFA object model {{and a set of}} interactive software tools for searching, filtering, and extracting information from scientific text. In particular, we describe BioFerret, a <b>metasearch</b> <b>tool</b> for searching and filtering relevant information from the web, and ALFA Text Viewer, an interactive tool for userguided extraction, disambiguation, and representation of information from scientific text. We further demonstrate the potential of our tools in integrating the extracted information with experimental data and diagrammatic biological models via the common underlying ALFA representation.

40|$|Objective – To {{assess how}} the {{increase}} in number of electronic journals available to academic scholars has changed their information-seeking or consulting behaviour, with respect to 1) the amount and diversity of sources they read; 2) strategies they use to keep up-to-date in their fields; 3) use of personalized information services; 4) determining the value and relevance of articles; and 5) personal management of scientific information. This study is a follow-up to an earlier quantitative study (Borrego, Anglada, Barrios, & Comellas, 2007) in the same setting. Design – Qualitative, using an open-ended questionnaire, followed by personal interviews {{of a small group}} of the respondents. Setting – Universities that are members of the Consortium of Academic Libraries of Catalonia (CBUC), which is made up of the eight public Catalan universities and the National Library of Catalonia, Spain. Subjects – One hundred thirty-seven scholars from the member universities of diverse ages and disciplines. Eleven of these academics were selected for personal interviews. Methods – The authors used a two-staged approach to gather comments from researchers on their use of electronic journals. First, an open-ended, self-administered questionnaire (with some pre-testing done) was sent by e-mail to some 490 academics who had provided e-mail addresses in the quantitative study; 137 were returned and analyzed. Personal interviews were then conducted with 11 scholars who had given the most detailed answers in the questionnaire. Their ages ranged from 28 to 67; each was from a different discipline, and from six of the universities. Informed consent sheets (describing the study and guaranteeing anonymity) were given to the 11 interviewees. Personal interviews were conducted in the subjects’ offices by one of the authors, and lasted between 45 - 60 minutes. In the interview stage, the authors wanted to examine: use and assessment of the library, access to electronic information, and impact of e-resources on information behaviour. Subjects were also asked to provide three suggestions on improving access to scientific information. Main Results – The amount of reading and number of electronic journals and other sources consulted among the scholars who participated in this study has increased. Three-quarters of survey respondents consult more journals and read more articles. The scholars reported that they are grateful for {{the increase in}} electronic information and its enhanced ease of access, and are not overwhelmed by it. Their reading has become more discriminatory, though, with many reporting “skimming” much of what they read to save time. Scholars keep up-to-date in three main ways: web browsing of journal issues, library database searches, and TOC e-mail alerts. More than 90 % of survey respondents reported conducting database searches. Google and Google Scholar were often mentioned ahead of specific library database names. In determining value and relevance of an article, its author and abstract are key for scholars. In addition, personal information management techniques used by scholars were all over the board. The three main methods were use of print or electronic folders, reference management software, and no system. Many of the academics felt their information management systems were “rudimentary” (p. 225). The request for suggestions and comments on the questionnaire was not answered by “most of the sample” (p. 226). Those who did respond to this request asked for more library resources. The main complaint expressed by scholars concerned the difficulty and complexity of finding journal article content using the Library website (e. g., varying databases, difficulty of interpreting what journal electronic and print holdings are available). Because of this, a number of scholars used Google to find library-subscribed content. Conclusion – By having greater and easier access to e-journals, scholars accessing the CBUC read more articles from more disciplines. Scholars would prefer a simpler library interface to search for online content. Due to the complexity of finding article content, they use web search tools like Google and Google Scholar to get to what they need faster. The authors of this study believe research should be conducted on the use of the Consortium’s <b>metasearch</b> <b>tool</b> to reduce the complexity. Research should also be conducted on value-added features of search interfaces for particular disciplines...|$|E
