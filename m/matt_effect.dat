40|$|Treball de Final de grau en Química. Codi: QU 0943. Curs acadèmic 2015 - 2016 In this degree final project, I {{have been}} working with Technology Ceramic Institute of the University Jaume I of Castellón de la Plana. In recent years, the form of {{decoration}} of ceramic tiles has completely changed. The apparition of the first decorating ceramic tiles machine which used digital inkjet technology revolutionized the ceramics sector. These developments have made a necessary remodeling in the traditional inks and their properties to adapt them to the required ones for this new type of applications. In this project, a review of digital inkjet technology will be done and different formulations of ink with alumina will be studied as preliminary studies {{in order to get a}} <b>matt</b> <b>effect...</b>|$|E
5000|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim, {{with many}} praising Mathieson's script, Coleman's {{performance and the}} uniquely designed monsters. The episode also received an AI of 85, considered excellent. Neela Debnath of The Independent praised Capaldi and Coleman's performances and believed this episode to be the stronger of Mathieson's two episodes, although she was critical of the CGI <b>effects.</b> <b>Matt</b> Risley of IGN gave the episode 8.3 out of 10, praising {{the concept of the}} episode and the performance of Coleman, but criticising the guest cast. [...] Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy gave a mixed review of the episode, calling it [...] "a bumpy ride." [...] He too was critical of the supporting cast, citing lack of depth to their personalities. He was however, positive of the CGI, calling it [...] "the most impressive and distinctive this show has featured in recent memory." [...] Overall he gave the episode 3 stars out of five.|$|R
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the first}} season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated a B-. Scott Bairstow's guest role was praised, though {{it was noted that}} [...] "an ultimately contrived plot and a stereotypical Bible-thumping Southern milieu make for a case more suited to Jessica Fletcher than Mulder and Scully". Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, described it as [...] "a largely predictable story that hits all the middle-of-the-road marks", finding the religious imagery to have been used to little <b>effect.</b> <b>Matt</b> Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, felt that the identity of the killer {{was one of the few}} endings amongst first season episodes that he had found genuinely surprising, though he attributed this to the episode's focus on Mulder's personal history. The use of Mulder's visions of his sister Samantha as a motivation for his actions in this episode has been seen as [...] "opening up" [...] the overarching search for the truth about her through the series. The plot for [...] "Miracle Man" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 2000 by Terry Bisson.|$|R
