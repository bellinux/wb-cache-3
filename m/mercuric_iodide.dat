40|$|The auther {{successfully}} fixed stained granules of the supravitally stained {{bone marrow}} cells {{by the use}} of <b>mercuric</b> potassium <b>iodide</b> solution for quantative determination of NH(3). Insoluble complex of the dye can be produced by the reaction between dimethylamino rdaicals of the dye and <b>mercuric</b> potassium <b>iodide.</b> The fine structure of the protoplasma can be retained by using <b>mercuric</b> potassium <b>iodide</b> solution added an equal volume of 2 % osmic acid solution (pH 7. 4) for the fixation. Electronmicroscopic observation on the bone marrow cells stained supravitally with Janus green B and fixed by the solution just mentioned revealed that Janus green B granules appear as electron dense mass or rings having thick walls and it has been proved these granules are nothing but the mitochondria themselves, from the morphologic pictures of those less electron dense granules. The electron density of the granules should be given by mercury. As the reaction of the dye with <b>mercuric</b> potassium <b>iodide</b> should occur in both colored and non-colored leuco-Janus green as well, because the reaction has no relation with reduction or oxidation of the dye, then, the results, show that Janus green B stains mitochondria selectively, but on other elements of cytoplasma. Osmic acid is proven to have an ability to oxidize the leuco-Janus green B to a colored one in vitro, and the light microscopic observations of the cells treated with the fixatives just mentioned showed only the green mitochondria without any coloration of other cytoplasmic area. This again shows the Janus green enters into mitochondrira selectively. These observations refute the theory propored by Lazarow and Cooperstein in which they claim that the Janus green entors into the cytoplasma diffusely, but mitochondria only can be recognized as the stained granules by the oxydation of Janus green B. But, there are some of mitochondria remain without staining. Any other cytoplasmic elements are not stained by Janus green B as far as the cells the auther observed. As an exceptional case, in reticulocyte, Janus green stains endoplasmic reticulum but not the mitochondria, giving the picture of Substantia Granulo-Fiamentosa (SGF), themselves. This may mean the changes in chemical components of the organellae in reticulocytes as they are differentiated to synthesize haemoglobin...|$|R

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis {{discusses}} an unprecedented acylation of allylic mercurials by acyl chlorides promoted by aluminum chloride. A variety of allylic mercurials and acyl chlorides, including aliphatic, aromatic, and [alpha],[beta]-unsaturated acyl chlorides, can be employed successfully in this reaction. This reaction provides a convenient route to allylic ketones. A modified literature procedure to prepare allylic <b>mercuric</b> <b>iodides</b> from the corresponding allylic halides and metallic mercury is also presented in this part;The second part of this thesis discusses the palladium-catalyzed coupling of aryl iodides, nonconjugated dienes, and nucleophiles, which generates more than one carbon-carbon bond or carbon-heteroatom bond at a time via palladium migration chemistry. Considerable functionality can be accommodated in this reaction and the palladium can migrate along a carbon chain as far as ten carbon atoms;The second part of this thesis is divided into three sections. The first section deals with the palladium-catalyzed coupling of aryl iodides and nonconjugated dienes using carbon nucleophiles. The reaction results in a high degree of regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. Applications of nitrogen and oxygen nucleophiles in this unique coupling reaction are reported in the second section. A variety of amines and the azide anion have been used as representative nitrogen nucleophiles and only one regio- and stereoisomer is isolated in good yields. When oxygen nucleophiles, such as acetate anion and phenoxide anion, are used in the coupling process, a mixture of regio- and stereoisomers is obtained. The focus of the third section is the application of the three-component coupling methodology to the synthesis of analogues of some naturally occurring pyridine alkaloids. The palladium-catalyzed coupling-migration approach is the key step and the total synthesis is accomplished in only two steps...|$|R

But, the fixation method is not perfect for electron microscopy, because the resulted precitants of mercuric potassium iodine-dye complex is easily soluble in pure alcohol, and {{there is a possibility that}} the complex is lost during dehydration. Hereupon, the author tried to substitute the dye complex with mercuric sulfide which is insoluble in water, alcohol and ether and by this substitution the granules should be retained safely through dehydration for electron microscopy. Observations revealed that the stable complex of the dye. HgS can be produced in the site of dye granules by exposing the cells, which were previously stained supravitally and treated with <b>mercuric</b> potassium <b>iodide,</b> to (NH(4)) (2) Sx solution. The fine structure of the protoplasma proved to be retained through the treatment with (NH(4)) (2) Sx solution giving almost the same picture as those treated only with mereric potassium iodide solution added an equal volume of 2 % osmic acid solution (pH. 7. 4). Electronmicroscopic observation on the cells stained supravitally with Janus green B and fixed by the method just mentioned revealed that Janus green B granules appear as opaque masses of uniform in density or rings having thick opaque walls and scanty in contents. Morphologic observation proved granules are the mitochondria themselves, because some of them showed the inner structure like cristae. Treatment with (NH(4)) (2) Sx seems to increase the opacity the dye granules, and the prolonged treatment results in the formation of black masses irregulare in shape. The result obtained is almost the same as demonstrated by SENO et al, but in my experiment the possility of solving out of dyes from some cytoplasmic area has been complexely devoided. And now it can safely be said that Janus green stains mitochondria selectively. Dye, even in its lenco type, is not detected in the ground substance of cytoplasm. These observations refute the theory proposed by LAZAROW and COOPERSTEIN in which they claim that the Janus green B enters into the cytoplasma diffusely, but mitochondria only can be recognized as the stained granules by the oxidation of Janus green B.

X-ray detectors with areas of 12 to 100 mm square and 1 mm thickness have absorption efficiencies approaching 100 % up to 60 keV. The spectral resolution of these detectors ranges from 400 eV to 600 eV at 5. 9 keV, depending on their area, and the electronic noise threshold is less than 1. 0 keV. Gamma ray detectors can be fabricated with dimensions of 25 mm x 25 mm x 3 mm. The spectral resolution of these detectors is less than 4 % FWHM at energies of 662 keV. Because of the high atomic numbers of the constituent elements of the <b>mercuric</b> <b>iodide,</b> the full energy peak efficiency is higher than for any other available solid-state detector that makes measurements up to 10 MeV a possibility. The operation of gamma ray detectors has been evaluated over a temperature range of- 20 through + 55 degrees Celsius, with only a very small shift in full energy peak observed over this temperature range. In combination with Cesium Iodide scintillators, <b>mercuric</b> <b>iodide</b> detectors with 25 mm diameter dimensions can be used as photodetectors to replace bulky and fragile photomultiplier tubes. The spectral resolution of these detectors is less than 7 % FWHM at 662 keV and the quantum efficiency is larger than 80 % over the whole area of the detector.
