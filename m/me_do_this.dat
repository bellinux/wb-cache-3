25|$|I {{always had}} the feeling that no one {{understood}} me anyway, that no one knew who I was and what made <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> or that. And you know, when no one understands you, no one can call you to account. Not even the court could call me to account. But the dead can. They understand. They don't even have to have been there, but if they do, they understand even better. Here in prison they were with me a lot. They came every night, whether I wanted them to or not. Before the trial I could still chase them away when they wanted to come.|$|E
500|$|When it {{came time}} to record a lead single, Yankovic once again turned his {{attention}} to Michael Jackson. Jackson had just released his album Bad, a follow-up to 1983's immensely successful album Thriller. After Yankovic first heard the lead single, [...] "Bad", he immediately envisioned a parody entitled [...] "Fat". Initially, Yankovic didn't want to record another Michael Jackson parody. He later said, [...] "I was still primarily known as the 'Eat It' guy and I didn't want to become known as the guy who just rides Michael's coattails." [...] He later relented and sought out Jackson for permission. Jackson, a fan of Yankovic's work, had already let Yankovic parody his 1983 hit single [...] "Beat It". When presented with the new potential parody, Jackson not only approved it, but let Yankovic use his own Moonwalker subway set for the music video. Yankovic later presented Jackson with a gold record of Even Worse after the album sold over 500,000 copies. Jackson was so pleased with the song and video, he ordered twelve copies to give to his friends. [...] Yankovic later said, [...] "He doesn't have to let <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> kind of stuff. [...] The only reason he would let me is because he has a great sense of humor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hunter's {{entry into}} the music {{business}} came after a chance encounter with Colin York and Colin Broom at a Butlin's Holiday Camp, where the trio won a talent competition performing [...] "Blue Moon" [...] on acoustic guitars. York and Broom were members of a Northampton-based band called The Apex Group, fronted by bass player and band leader Frank Short. Hunter soon left his home in Shrewsbury, transferred his apprenticeship from Sentinel/Rolls Royce to British Timken in Northampton, and joined The Apex Group on rhythm guitar. Hunter recalls jumping around like a lunatic on stage: [...] "Music affected me so much. The rest of them just stood there. It was funny, I had kids who came just to watch <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> and I can't imagine what it looked like." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'You {{should think}} more of yourself, {{and a little}} less of other people, then,' said Vera, with a sneer at the 'other people'. She rose. 'Let <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> You sit down; you are tired, Mother,' she said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> mother," [...] said Janet. She {{knew her}} mother was {{thinking}} of the newly-found joy that Lise's disgrace had marred, but she released her hands, gently, and took the mop from the nail on which it hung.|$|E

6000|$|Swish-swish! The cutter came by; Noel started {{forward to}} {{her place in the}} row; but {{catching}} her arm, he said: [...] "No, let <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> little bit. I haven't had a day in the fields since the war began. Talk to me while I'm binding." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be alarmed, Mary," [...] he said, with a smile, at the consternation in her face. [...] "You won't {{often see}} <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> and I {{can assure you}} that spirit-drinking is not an {{habitual}} vice with me, but I really wanted it then. They are still fighting fiercely from Porte St. Martin down to the Place de la Bastille. I believe all resistance has been crushed out {{on the south side of}} the river, and in a couple of days the whole thing will be over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am comforted, Sylvia, {{rest assured}} of that. And {{now there is}} little more to say, but one thing to do. I shall not see your husband yet, and leave you {{to tell him what}} seems best, for, with the {{instinct}} of an animal, I always go away to outlive my hurts alone. But remember that I acquit you of blame, and believe that I will yet be happy in your happiness. I know if Geoffrey were here, he would let <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> because he has suffered as I suffer now." ...|$|E

5000|$|The show {{started at}} the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1999, and starred Mack, Catherine Tate and Dan Antopolski. Mack later {{expressed}} regret at not including them in the TV show, stating: [...] "I’m not a great believer in regret, but looking back over the last eighteen years of <b>me</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> job, not keeping our sketch show Bits together and jumping at the first offer to put a version of it on telly is probably the biggest mistake I’ve made.

60|$|A {{part of my}} {{duty was}} to watch the fanning mill (in the high cupola) in order that the sieves should not clog. Three flights of stairs led to the mill and these had to be mounted many times each day. I always ran up the steps when the mill {{required}} my attention, but in coming down I usually swung from beam to beam, dropping from footway to footway like a monkey from a tall tree. My mother in seeing <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> called out in terror, but I assured her {{that there was not}} the slightest danger--and this was true, for I was both sure-footed and sure-handed in those days.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} glad indeed if I can {{offer you a}} happier life than the life you are leading now.

I am waiting your answer in the neighborhood. If any hinderance should prevent you from {{replying}} at once, I add the name of the hotel at which I am staying--so that you may telegraph to me, before I leave London to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When {{he first}} came I mistook him {{for you in the}} darkness,' Lesage answered. 'You will {{acknowledge}} {{that it was not a}} night on which one would expect to meet many people in the salt-marsh. On discovering my mistake I shut the door and concealed the papers in the chimney. I had forgotten that he might see <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> through that crack by the hinges, but when I went out again, to show him his way and so get rid of him, my eye caught the gap, and I at once realised that he had seen my action, and that it must have aroused his curiosity to such an extent that it would be quite certain that he would think and speak of it. I called him back into the hut, therefore, in order that I might have time to consider what I had best do with him.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Negative reinforcement: {{involves}} removing {{one from}} a negative situation as a reward, e.g. [...] "You won't have to do your homework if you allow <b>me</b> to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> to you." ...|$|R

5000|$|In a {{very short}} amount of time, they {{recorded}} an album of 10 tracks called Songs from the Earth and released it on Nitro Records in 2001 [...] [...] "To <b>me,</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> record {{was sort of a}} tribute to Samhain. Playing guitar for Samhain on the reunion tour was such an honor. I had forgotten how much I love and respect the band," [...] Youth stated. The album featured guest guitar and keyboard from Glenn Danzig on the tracks Stray and Songs From The Earth.|$|R
6000|$|GERARD. Oh, my lord, only once--let me {{this once}} [...] Speak {{what is on}} my mind! Since first I noted [...] All this, I've groaned as if a fiery net [...] Plucked me this way and that--fire if I turned [...] To her, fire if I turned to you, and fire [...] If down I flung myself and strove to die. [...] The lady {{could not have been}} seven years old [...] When I was trusted to conduct her safe [...] Through the deer-herd to stroke the snow-white fawn [...] I brought to eat bread from her tiny hand [...] Within a month. She ever had a smile [...] To greet me with--she... if it could undo [...] What's done, to lop each limb from off this trunk... All that is foolish talk, not fit for you-- [...] I mean, I could not speak and bring her hurt [...] For Heaven's compelling. But when I was fixed [...] To hold my peace, each morsel of your food [...] Eaten beneath your roof, my birth-place too, [...] Choked me. I wish I had grown mad in doubts [...] What it behoved <b>me</b> <b>do.</b> <b>This</b> morn it seemed [...] Either I must confess to you or die: [...] Now it is done, I seem the vilest worm [...] That crawls, to have betrayed my lady.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} love me, James. I've {{always tried to}} be a good father to you; and God knows I've done all I could to make you happy. If I did wrong in letting you become engaged, I beg your pardon. No; let me go on." [...] This he said in answer to Jamie's {{movement}} of affectionate protest. [...] "I don't say it to reproach you, but your mother and I have denied ourselves in all we could so that you should be happy and comfortable. It's been a pleasure to us, for we love you with all our hearts. You know what happened to me when I left the army. I told you years ago of the awful disgrace I suffered. I could never have lived except for my trust in God and my trust in you. I looked to you to regain the honour which I had lost. Ah! you don't know how anxiously I watched you, and the joy with which I said to myself, 'There is a good and honourable man.' And now you want to stain that honour. Oh, James, James! I'm old, and I can't live long. If you love me, if you think you have cause for gratitude to <b>me,</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> one little thing I ask you! For my sake, my dear, keep your word to Mary Clibborn." ...|$|E
60|$|It didn't {{seem like}} we {{was the same}} lot that {{was in such a}} state to find land and git ashore, but it was. But we had got over that--clean over it. We was used to the balloon now and not afraid any more, and didn't want to be anywheres else. Why, it seemed just like home; it 'most seemed as if I had been born and raised in it, and Jim and Tom said the same. And always I had had hateful people around me, a-nagging at me, and pestering of me, and scolding, and finding fault, and fussing and bothering, and {{sticking}} to me, and keeping after me, and making <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> and making me do that and t'other, and always selecting out the things I didn't want to do, and then giving me Sam Hill because I shirked and done something else, and just aggravating the life out of a body all the time; but up here in the sky it was so still and sunshiny and lovely, and plenty to eat, and plenty of sleep, and strange things to see, and no nagging and no pestering, and no good people, and just holiday all the time. Land, I warn't in no hurry to git out and buck at civilization again. Now, {{one of the worst things}} about civilization is, that anybody that gits a letter with trouble in it comes and tells you all about it and makes you feel bad, and the newspapers fetches you the troubles of everybody all over the world, and keeps you downhearted and dismal 'most all the time, and it's such a heavy load for a person. I hate them newspapers; and I hate letters; and if I had my way I wouldn't allow nobody to load his troubles on to other folks he ain't acquainted with, on t'other side of the world, that way. Well, up in a balloon there ain't any of that, and it's the darlingest place there is.|$|E

5000|$|Leigh {{has also}} stated {{she hopes to}} become part of a musical {{movement}} bringing singers (as opposed to dancehall deejays) back to the forefront in reggae. As she told noted writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning Blues & Soul: I think the reason we're now living in the decade of dancehall deejays is because everyone these days is so into hip hop and rap, and dancehall is basically the reggae version of that. But hopefully <b>me</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> can help signal the start of many more successful new reggae vocalists to come." ...|$|R

5000|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that Jack used to consider killing a last resort. When he was fighting the bastard child of an American President mentioned above, he said [...] "Damn you for making <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> you filthy bastard" [...] just before hanging him. With tears welling in his eyes, he asks Stormwatch control to teleport {{him out of the}} place.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} ask you, nor would you, {{if you still}} wished, do it joyfully with me. Be such as seems good to you. But I will bury him.
