50|$|Through their {{collaborative}} efforts, the Rothschilds rose {{to prominence}} {{in a variety}} of banking endeavors including loans, government bonds and trading in bullion. Their financing afforded investment opportunities and during the 19th century, they became major stakeholders in large-scale mining and rail transport ventures that were fundamental to the rapidly expanding industrial economies of Europe. In partnership with N M Rothschild & Sons of England, they owned Chemin de Fer du Nord railway in France that ran from their Gare du Nord station in Paris to the English Channel. In addition, the Rothschilds in France became leaders in the wine growing industry. By the later part of the 19th century, oil was fast becoming an important commodity and the French bank was heavily involved in oil exploration in the Baku area of present-day Azerbaijan through their company, the Caspian and Black Sea Oil Industry and Trade Society established in 1883. Their investment proved to be a lucrative one and {{by the turn of the}} century, the various oil companies in Azerbaijan were producing more oil than any other country in the world. In 1898, the Rothschilds established the <b>Mazut</b> Transportation Society that developed a fleet of oil tankers operating in the Caspian Sea. In 1911, the Royal Dutch Shell company purchased the Azerbaijan oil fields from the Rothschild family.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mazut</b> as {{a source}} content of various {{hydrocarbons}} is hard to be degraded and its cracking could turn <b>mazut</b> into useful materials. Nevertheless degradation of <b>mazut</b> by routine methods is too expensive but application of indigenous microorganisms as biocatalysts could be effective and important to lower the costs and expand its consumption. <b>Mazut</b> biodegradation can be improved using various strategies; Therefore in this study newly isolated strain Enterobacter cloacae BBRC 10061 was used in a method of gradual addition of <b>mazut</b> into medium and its results were compared with simple addition method. To investigate degradation of <b>mazut</b> by BBRC 10061, influence of increase of <b>mazut</b> concentration was assayed based on gradual addition method. Also different kinetic models were used to evaluate kinetics of the process. Results showed that gradual addition method has been a beneficial technique for improvement of <b>mazut</b> degradation because bacterial induction to produce biosurfactant and essential enzymes for cracking <b>mazut</b> was higher during process. Although addition of more <b>mazut</b> increased the rate of biodegradation but percentage of degradation decreased. pH of medium decreased during biodegradation period while electric potential increased. Also the biodegradation kinetics was not fitted with the biokinetic models; therefore kinetics of biodegradation of <b>mazut</b> has to be studied by new models...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Biodegradation of hea-vy fuel oil(Mazut) by {{indigenous}} competent microorganisms {{is one of}} the new {{fields of}} biotechnology in petroleum industries. Biocompatibi-lity and inexpensiveness characterist-ics of the method have developed its application day to day. Isolation and identification of oil bacteria can be an effective approach for degrading heavy fuel oil. Materials & Methods: Sampling of the soil and water sources contamin-ated with oil components was carried out. The samples were incubated on special culture conditions to screen potential microorganisms. Then, their degrading ability was investigated on <b>mazut.</b> Best microorganisms were se-lected and identified. Then, the degr-adation capability for <b>mazut</b> was in-vestigated in matrices containing fix-ed and floating <b>mazut</b> by the strain bacteria. Findings: The new strain Entero-bacter cloacae (BBRC 10061) was isolated and identified from oil conta-minated soil in Mashhad to biod-egrade <b>mazut.</b> In aerobic condition, 13 % of <b>mazut</b> (1 %v/v) containing in mineral environment was degraded by BBRC 10061 during a 10 -day period.

In this study, the environmental impact caused by paper production at Pars Paper Factory, Iran, was evaluated using life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The ISO 14040 series were used as references. The functional unit considered was producing one metric tonne of paper for one year. The Centre of Environmental Science, Leiden University, NL, 2000 (CML 2 Baseline 2000) method was chosen for this LCA study. Ten impact categories were identified as follow: Abiotic depletion, acidification, eutrophication, global warming, ozone layer depletion, human toxicity, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, marine aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity and photochemical oxidation. From the results, using bagasse and electricity contributed the lowest impact value because both of these inputs used renewable sources. However, using heavy fuel oil (in this case <b>mazut)</b> gives the highest impact to global warming. Chlorine from bleaching sector contributes the impact for photochemical oxidation and ozone layer depletion.

40|$|Processed {{by-products}} of oil are {{the most}} common pollutants in all river and sea water. The increase in oxidative stress in bivalve molluscs was studied in both tissues of the hepatopancreas and the gill. The model for artificial treatment with processed by-products of oil was performed in a laboratory experiment with the river mollusc Dreissena polymorpha Pallas, 1771. The exposure of the molluscs over 28 days to <b>mazut</b> 50 mg/l induced significant increase of both final product of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and antioxidant enzime activity. A significant increase in LPO was observed in the hepatopancreas and gill of D. polymorpha treated with <b>mazut</b> compared to the control group. Antioxidant enzyme activity of cartalase, supeoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase and glutathione-S-transferase showed a greater increase (by almost 1. 5 times) in the hepatopancreas than in the gill of D.  polymorpha. A similar LPO growth and modulation of antioxidant enzyme activity were determined in the hepatopancreas and gill of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamarck, 1879 collected in an area polluted with resins, hydrocarbons and asphaltenes, Donuzlav lake in the Kerch gulf. Varied cellular reactivation of the antioxidant enzyme system in the hepatopancreas rather than the gill was observed in both kinds of mollusc Dreissena and Mytilus.

40|$|The {{immediate}} effect of energy consumption on environment quality is its deterioration. Gas and dust emissions, as products of coal, <b>mazut</b> (heavy fuel oil) or natural gas combustion, continually pollute {{the atmosphere and}} have a global effect on climate changes, ozone damage, acid rains, disappearing of sensitive ecosystems, etc. This, directly or indirectly, brings about pollution of soil and fresh water, since energy life cycle begins with mines, oil and gas deposits, and ends with mechanical operations, heating and cooling with the restoration of thermal energy back into the atmosphere.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the results of an ex situ bioremediation of soil contaminated by <b>mazut</b> (heavy residual fuel oil) in the field scale (600 m 3). The treatment-bed (thickness 0. 4 m) consisted of mechanically mixed mazut-contaminated soil, softwood sawdust as an additional carbon source and crude river sand, as a bulking and porosity increasing material. The inoculation/reinoculation was conducted periodically using a biomass of a consortium of zymogenous microorganisms isolated from a bioremediation substrate. The biostimulation was performed through addition of nutritious substances (N, P and K). The aeration was improved by systematic mixing of the bioremediation system. After 50 days, the number of hydrocarbon degraders had increased a 100 fold. Based on the changes in the group composition, the average biodegradation rate during bioremediation was 24 mg kg- 1 day- 1 for the aliphatic fraction, 6 mg kg- 1 day- 1 for the aromatic fraction and 3 mg kg- 1 day- 1 for the nitrogen–sulphur–oxygen compounds (NSO) –asphaltene fraction.

40|$|The {{failures}} of superheater and reheater boiler tubes {{operating in a}} power plant utilizing natural gas or <b>mazut</b> as a fuel have been analysed and the fire-side corrosion has been suggested as {{the main reason for}} the failure in boiler tubes. The tubes have been provided by a fossil fuel power plant in Iran and optical and electron microscopy investigations have been performed on the tubes as well as the corrosion products on their surfaces. The results showed that the thickness of the failed tubes is not uniform which suggests that fire-side corrosion has happened on the tubes. Fire-side corrosion is caused by the reaction of combustion products with oxide layers on the tube surface resulting in metal loss and consequently tubes fracture. However, the tubes corrosion behaviour did not follow the conventional models of the fire-side corrosion. Given that, using the corrosion monitoring techniques for these boiler tubes seems essential. As a result, the thickness of the boiler tubes {{in different parts of the}} boiler has been recorded and critical points are selected accordingly.

40|$|One of {{important}} subjects considered in models {{of economic growth}} is convergence hypothesis. It posits that if different regions have identical levels of log-term equilibrium per capita GDP, the poor regions would have higher rate of per capita GDP growth than rich ones. Therefore the more poor regions would converge towards richer regions {{in terms of economic}} conditions. However, since determining factors for long term per capita GDP is not the same in all of regions, the conditional convergence is suggested. This hypothesis states that farer regions from long term per capita GDP would have higher rate of per capita GDP. Since determining factors on economic growth can influence on convergence process, the impact of consuming petroleum products as a determining variable on economic growth has been studied. The model of Barro and Sala-I-Martin was applied in order to examine convergence and the impact of consuming petroleum products on convergence and also reduction of regional inequality among Iran's provinces from 2000 through 2011. Results indicated that there is an unconditional convergence among Iran's provinces and also variables of gasoline, diesel, and <b>Mazut</b> (fuel oil) have significant impact on economic growth and lead to negative convergence among Iran's province.
