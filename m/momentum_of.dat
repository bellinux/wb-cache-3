5|$|A close {{binary star}} system occurs when two stars orbit {{each other with}} an average {{separation}} that is of the same order of magnitude as their diameters. At these distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as tidal effects, transfer of mass and even collisions. Tidal interactions in a close binary system can result in modification of the orbital and rotational parameters. The total angular <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> the system is conserved, but the angular momentum can be transferred between the orbital periods and the rotation rates.|$|E

5|$|The {{classical}} formulae for {{the energy}} and <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> electromagnetic radiation can be re-expressed in terms of photon events. For example, the pressure of electromagnetic radiation on an object derives from the transfer of photon momentum per unit time and unit area to that object, since pressure is force per unit area and force is the change in momentum per unit time.|$|E
5|$|The orbital angular <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> {{electrons}} is quantized. Because {{the electron}} is charged, it produces an orbital magnetic moment that {{is proportional to}} the angular momentum. The net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to the vector sum of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and the nucleus. The magnetic moment of the nucleus is negligible compared with that of the electrons. The magnetic moments of the electrons that occupy the same orbital (so called, paired electrons) cancel each other out.|$|E

5|$|A {{consequence}} of describing electrons as waveforms {{is that it}} is mathematically impossible to simultaneously derive the position and <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> an electron. This became known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle after the theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg, who first described it and published it in 1927. This invalidated Bohr's model, with its neat, clearly defined circular orbits. The modern model of the atom describes the positions of electrons in an atom in terms of probabilities. An electron can potentially be found at any distance from the nucleus, but, depending on its energy level, exists more frequently in certain regions around the nucleus than others; this pattern is referred to as its atomic orbital. The orbitals {{come in a variety of}} shapes-sphere, dumbbell, torus, etc.-with the nucleus in the middle.|$|E
5|$|After Georgia Tech's post-score kickoff, Wake Forest {{continued}} to struggle on offense. Quarterback Riley Skinner was sacked, threw an 18-yard completion, then three incomplete passes. Wake {{was forced to}} punt the ball away again, allowing the Yellow Jackets the possibility of expanding their lead. On Tech's first play after the punt, however, Reggie Ball's pass was intercepted, allowing Wake Forest another chance on offense. The play turned the <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> the game in favor of Wake Forest, who proceeded to move the ball with slightly more effectiveness. During the Wake Forest drive, Skinner completed a 39-yard pass to John Tereshinski, who drove the Deacons inside Georgia Tech territory, where the drive continued. Though Wake Forest was forced {{to settle for a}} 33-yard field goal from kicker Sam Swank, the score tied the game at 66 with 7:59 remaining in the game.|$|E

The last toured in North America after the London run. His final West End play was The Understanding (1982), a gentle comedy of late-flowering love. Celia Johnson was cast as his co-star, but died suddenly just before the first night.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{electron}} correlation on the angle dependence of magnetoconductivity is studied in quasi-one-dimensional organic conductors. We investigated {{the effect on}} the basis <b>of</b> the <b>momentum</b> dependence <b>of</b> both quasi-particle's lifetime and velocity near the spin-density-wave (SDW). We found that the <b>momentum</b> dependence <b>of</b> quasi-particle's lifetime mainly governs the angle dependence of one-dimensional axis magnetoconductivity. On the other hand, the change in velocity originating from the electron correlation gives the dominant effects on the angle dependence of the interchain axis magnetoconductivity. The effect of electron correlation is clarified from the association <b>of</b> the <b>momentum</b> dependences <b>of</b> lifetime and velocity with the <b>momentum</b> dependences <b>of</b> commensurate orbitals on a Fermi surface in magnetic fields.

5|$|At {{the extreme}} of {{interactions}} are galactic mergers. In {{this case the}} relative <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> the two galaxies is insufficient to allow the galaxies to pass through each other. Instead, they gradually merge to form a single, larger galaxy. Mergers can result in significant changes to morphology, {{as compared to the}} original galaxies. If one of the merging galaxies is much more massive than the other merging galaxy then the result is known as cannibalism. The more massive larger galaxy will remain relatively undisturbed by the merger, while the smaller galaxy is torn apart. The Milky Way galaxy is currently in the process of cannibalizing the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy and the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|By 1914, {{experiments}} by physicists Ernest Rutherford, Henry Moseley, James Franck and Gustav Hertz {{had largely}} established {{the structure of}} an atom as a dense nucleus of positive charge surrounded by lower-mass electrons. In 1913, Danish physicist Niels Bohr postulated that electrons resided in quantized energy states, with their energies determined by the angular <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> the electron's orbit about the nucleus. The electrons could move between those states, or orbits, by the emission or absorption of photons of specific frequencies. By means of these quantized orbits, he accurately explained the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom. However, Bohr's model failed {{to account for the}} relative intensities of the spectral lines and it was unsuccessful in explaining the spectra of more complex atoms.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{disadvantage}} in numbers {{as well as}} attacking a fixed position, Williams' and Macdonell's small force was driving the opposing force {{to the edge of}} the gorge on which the redan was situated, and seemed on the verge of success before the Americans were able to regroup and stand firm. The <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> the battle turned when a musket ball hit Macdonell's mount (causing it to rear and twist around) and another shot hit him in the small of the back, causing him to fall from the horse. He was removed from the battlefield and died from his injuries early the next day. Captain Williams was laid low by a wound to the head, and Dennis by a severe wound to the thigh (although he continued to lead his detachment throughout the action). Carrying Macdonnell and the body of Brock, the British fell back through Queenston to Durham's Farm, a mile north near Vrooman's Point.|$|E
5|$|Dynamic {{balance is}} {{provided}} through the three semicircular canals. These three canals are orthogonal (at right angles) to each other. At {{the end of}} each canal is a slight enlargement, known as the ampulla, which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central area called the cupula. The fluid in these canals rotates according to the <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> the head. When a person changes acceleration, the inertia of the fluid changes. This affects the pressure on the cupula, and results in the opening of ion channels. This causes depolarisation, which is passed as a signal to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve. Dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking when moving, via the vestibulo–ocular reflex.|$|E
5|$|For illustration, if a {{physical}} system behaves the same, {{regardless of how}} it is oriented in space, the physical laws that govern it are rotationally symmetric; from this symmetry, Noether's theorem shows the angular <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> the system must be conserved. The physical system itself need not be symmetric; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry. Rather, the symmetry of the physical laws governing the system {{is responsible for the}} conservation law.
