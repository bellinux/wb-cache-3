Sastre himself seemed to be off the form he had had before the rest day, and by virtue of Pellizotti's stage win and two-minute gap over the reigning Tour de France champion, he fell from third to fifth in the overall classification with Pellizotti <b>moving</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> third.|$|E

5|$|The Romans began {{military}} expeditions {{into what}} is now Scotland from about 71 CE, building a series of forts, but by 87 the occupation {{was limited to the}} Southern Uplands {{and by the end of}} the first century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth. The Romans eventually withdrew to a line in what is now northern England, building the fortification known as Hadrian's Wall from coast to coast. Around 141 CE they undertook a reoccupation of southern Scotland, <b>moving</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> construct a new limes between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde, where they built the fortification known as the Antonine Wall. The wall was overrun and abandoned soon after 160 and the Romans withdrew back to the line of Hadrian's Wall, until Roman authority collapsed in the early fifth century.|$|E
5|$|After {{a two-hour}} delay, {{the race was}} restarted. Rahal {{suffered}} clutch problems on the restart, which placed him two laps down, while the other drivers ran behind the safety car, during which the marshalls showed {{the areas in which}} repair work had been conducted. Just prior to the restart, there was a short rain shower which made the track slightly slippy. Power lost one position on the restart, dropping to third. Franchitti, who was the closest driver to the front to have the softer compound red tires fitted gained two positions on the restart, <b>moving</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> fourth. The restart only lasted for six corners, before Castroneves spun in the wet conditions, and was then struck by Ed Carpenter. On the next corner, Josef Newgarden had slid into the wall and stalled, and a full-track caution was again called. The race was restarted with nine laps remaining, and Franchitti once more gained a position, passing Pagenaud to gain second. However, the race was almost immediately under a yellow flag again as E.J. Viso was spun by Marco Andretti, and stalled in the middle of turn four. From the ensuing restart, Dixon managed to maintain the lead from Franchitti, and the two Chip Ganassi Racing drivers completed a second successive one-two finish.|$|E

5|$|Gadret and Dupont then showed {{climbing}} prowess in {{the first}} of three consecutive high mountain stages that preceded the second rest day. While Contador and José Rujano were easily the strongest riders on the day, the Ag2r tandem broke away from the peloton behind and secured third and fourth positions on the day. Gadret was third, which afforded him a time bonus in addition to the actual time taken. This moved him into the top ten {{for the first time in}} the race, in eighth. Dupont also entered the top ten after this stage, at tenth place. With sixth place the next day on Monte Zoncolan and attrition to other riders, Gadret moved up further, to fifth place. Dupont finished eighth on this stage to move up to eighth overall. Gadret gained further time against the vast majority of the field in the Giro's queen stage, stage 15, by finishing fifth and <b>moving</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> fourth place in the overall standings. Dupont struggled, coming in 22nd on the day, to fall to 15th overall. Gadret finished the race in fourth place, holding it after each of the remaining stages. Dupont took back a little time against some of the other riders in the field in stages 17 and 20, to improve his final position to 12th. Gadret's fourth place was the team's best overall placement in a Grand Tour in their history, bettering the sixth place attained by Cyril Dessel in the 2006 Tour de France.|$|E
5|$|York {{recorded}} {{their first}} win in 17 matches after beating Plymouth 2–0 at home, with Chambers and Cresswell scoring {{in the first}} half. McGrath, Rankine and Rodman were sent back to their parent clubs, having become surplus to requirements under Worthington. The team were denied a second successive win after Peter Murphy scored a stoppage-time equaliser for Accrington, with the match finishing a 1–1 home draw, after Adam Reed had given York the lead in first half stoppage time. Carson and Kerr were ruled out {{for the remainder of}} the season through injury, with the former returning to parent club Ipswich after the expiration of his loan. York recorded a second victory in three matches after winning 2–0 away to Northampton, who had been on a run of ten consecutive home wins, with Chambers scoring in the first half and John Johnson scoring an own goal in the second half. This result saw York rise out of the relegation zone by <b>moving</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 20th place in the table, having occupied 23rd place following the previous four results. Cresswell was recalled from his loan by new Sheffield United caretaker manager Chris Morgan, after making an important contribution for York in their battle against relegation.|$|E
5|$|Later in April, {{the team}} took two wins at two {{concurrent}} events. In stage 2 at the Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey, Valentin {{took his first}} win {{of the season in}} a field sprint, besting Alessandro Petacchi at the finish. The victory made the younger Iglinsky the race leader for a day before he ceded it to 's Manuel Belletti, winner of stage 3. Later in the race, Zeits made a fortunate breakaway which took nearly 12 minutes over the rest of the peloton. The result put him fourth in the overall standings, 20 seconds clear of the man in fifth, but 10 minutes ahead of the man in sixth. The next day, the Astana squad worked hard to get another breakaway containing Zeits to the finish line first, which resulted him in <b>moving</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> second overall. He retained this position to the conclusion of the race. At the Tour de Romandie, Vinokourov won stage 3. He, Mickaël Cherel, and Tony Martin had slipped off the front of the field when the day's principal breakaway was caught, and stayed away to allow a three-up sprint decide the winner, though they had no appreciable time gap over the fast-charging peloton at the finish. Cherel protested the results, feeling that Vinokourov's sprint had illegally impeded him, but race officials upheld the order of finish on the road. Vinokourov felt after this result that he was a strong contender for the overall crown, sitting 32 seconds back with an individual time trial, where pending race leader Pavel Brutt struggles, still to race. He finished the race third, losing time to race champion Cadel Evans in that time trial. He later said he was satisfied with this performance. However, at this race, Kiserlovski was revealed to have worse injuries from his Paris–Nice crash than first thought. An MRI taken after the Romandie prologue, due to the Croatian suffering from severe shoulder pain, revealed that he had a cracked vertebra. He abandoned the race with hopes of recovering in time for the Giro d'Italia. Vinokourov had a successful Critérium du Dauphiné. He finished second in the prologue time trial and assumed the race lead the next day on the first road race stage. He held the jersey for a second day before losing it in the stage 3 time trial, a considerably longer course than the prologue. He finished a distant 14th, having difficulty on the technical descents on the course, and slipped to fourth overall. When Janez Brajkovič faltered in stage 6, Vinokourov re-assumed a podium position, third, and kept it to the race's conclusion the next day.|$|E
