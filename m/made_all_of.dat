5|$|The Browns next {{beat the}} Los Angeles Dons 31–14 in Cleveland {{to extend their}} winning streak to seven games. The crowd of 71,134 people who {{attended}} the game on a sunny October day was a professional football record. Cleveland {{got off to a}} slow start, falling behind 7–3 at halftime. The Browns' only score in the first half came on a 49-yard Lou Groza field goal, then the fourth-longest kick in professional football history. A flurry of scoring {{at the end of the}} third quarter and in the fourth quarter, however, won Cleveland the game. Otto Graham passed 36 yards to end Dante Lavelli and then ran in a touchdown with less than three minutes left in the third. It was the first of four touchdowns in 14 minutes of play. Fullback Marion Motley ran in two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, one of them a 68-yard run that tied an AAFC record for a rush from scrimmage. The Browns won despite a strong ground attack by the Dons, who gained 274 yards of rushing. The Dons had 21 first downs compared to Cleveland's 10. Groza <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his extra point attempts, extending his streak to 22 in a row.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{was born}} on 27 April 1759 in Spitalfields, London. She was {{the second of the}} seven {{children}} of Elizabeth Dixon and Edward John Wollstonecraft. Although her family had a comfortable income when she was a child, her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects. Consequently, the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecraft's youth. The family's financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecraft's father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity. Moreover, he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages. As a teenager, Wollstonecraft used to lie outside the door of her mother's bedroom to protect her. Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters, Everina and Eliza, throughout her life. For example, in a defining moment in 1784, she convinced Eliza, who was suffering from what was probably postpartum depression, to leave her husband and infant; Wollstonecraft <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the arrangements for Eliza to flee, demonstrating her willingness to challenge social norms. The human costs, however, were severe: her sister suffered social condemnation and, because she could not remarry, was doomed to a life of poverty and hard work.|$|E

25|$|Widely imitated, {{the safety}} bicycle {{completely}} replaced the high-wheeler in North America and Western Europe by 1890.

As with the original velocipede, safety bicycles had been much less comfortable than high-wheelers {{precisely because of the}} smaller wheel size, and frames were often buttressed with complicated bicycle suspension spring assemblies. The pneumatic tire <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these obsolete, and frame designers found a diamond pattern to be the strongest and most efficient design.|$|E

25|$|Professor Simo Parpola, basing his {{findings}} on a fragmented letter surviving from that period, holds that Arda-Mulišši, known as Adrammelech in the Bible, {{was the son}} who killed the King, and that {{a series of events}} beginning in 694BCE {{set the stage for the}} assassinaton. In 694, Sennacherib's oldest son and heir-designate Assur-nãdin-sumi was captured by Babylonians and was removed to Elam, whereafter he disappears from the historical record. Arda-Mulišši, the next eldest son, was expected to be the next heir-designate. However, Naqi'a Zakitu, the king's second wife, (entirely unrelated to Arda-Mulišši) used her influence to have the King proclaim her own sickly and frail son Esarhaddon the heir-designate. Sennacherib <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Assyria swear allegiance to the new crown prince.|$|E

500|$|Although Rothbard adopted von Mises' {{deductive}} {{methodology for}} his social theory and economics, he parted with Mises {{on the question}} of ethics. Specifically, he rejected Mises conviction that ethical values remain subjective, and opposed utilitarianism in favor of principle-based, natural law reasoning. In defense of his free market views, Mises employed utilitarian economic arguments aimed at demonstrating that interventionist policies <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> society worse off. Rothbard, on the other hand, concluded that interventionist policies do in fact benefit some people, including certain government employees and beneficiaries of social programs. Therefore, unlike Mises, Rothbard attempted to assert an objective, natural law basis for the free market. He called this principle [...] "self-ownership," [...] loosely basing the idea on the writings of John Locke and also borrowing concepts from classical liberalism and the anti-imperialism of the Old Right.|$|E

500|$|The 26-episode anime {{adaptation}} of Outlaw Star began broadcasting in Japan on TV Tokyo from January 8, 1998 and ended on June 25, 1998, though the broadcast began on January 9, {{as it was}} in a 1:15A.M. time slot. The series was licensed by Bandai Entertainment The English version was produced by ZRO Limit Productions and was aired on the evening Toonami block beginning on January 15, 2001. This broadcast of the show was heavily edited due to its adult content. Profanity was removed, scenes with violence and lewd behavior were cut or toned down, and many scenes containing nudity were altered by digitally inserting clothing onto characters. Episode 23, in which the Outlaw Star crew visits a hot spring planet, was not aired due to nudity and suggestive themes. However, some instances of adult language were not removed for the anime's initial run. Sean Akins, Toonami's creative director, claimed that Cartoon Network <b>made</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> their own edits to their licensed properties during this time period, which they did [...] "in a way that preserves the story". The role of Fred Luo, a recurring homosexual character, was considerably toned down. Cartoon Network had no specific editing policy with regard to gay characters, but that [...] "overt sexuality or implied sexuality of any kind are not allowed". Outlaw Star was also aired on the late night Adult Swim block throughout 2002. However, the broadcast was cancelled late in the year and, according to Akins, the network allowed its rights to the anime to expire by 2003. Outlaw Star was aired in the United Kingdom on CNX in October 2002. Following Funimation's acquisition of the series, the series is currently planned to be aired again on Cartoon Network, with their current Toonami block starting on Saturday August 19, 2017 at 2:30am.|$|E
