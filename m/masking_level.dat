2500|$|Karlheinz Brandenburg used a CD {{recording}} of Suzanne Vega's song [...] "Tom's Diner" [...] {{to assess and}} refine the MP3 compression algorithm. This song was chosen because of its nearly monophonic nature and wide spectral content, {{making it easier to}} hear imperfections in the compression format during playbacks. Some refer to Suzanne Vega as [...] "The mother of MP3". This particular track has an interesting property in that the two channels are almost, but not completely, the same, leading to a case where Binaural <b>Masking</b> <b>Level</b> Depression causes spatial unmasking of noise artifacts unless the encoder properly recognizes the situation and applies corrections similar to those detailed in the MPEG-2 AAC psychoacoustic model. Some more critical audio excerpts (glockenspiel, triangle, accordion, etc.) were taken from the EBU V3/SQAM reference compact disc and have been used by professional sound engineers to assess the subjective quality of the MPEG Audio formats. LAME is the most advanced MP3 encoder. LAME includes a VBR variable bit rate encoding which uses a quality parameter rather than a bit rate goal.

50|$|In early systems, digital masking {{generators}} had noticeable {{short term}} levels changes; the cycle time was so short {{that the same}} sound was created repetitively. As a result, some specifications required temporal uniformity in the short term. This problem was bypassed with the requirement for use of analog generators that created truly random sound. The problem has been designed away so almost all masking generators now create a digital signal {{that can only be}} interpreted by a listener as random. Now, masking sound in the short term has a constant level. The same is not true for longer periods. The privacy needs of occupants vary throughout the workday and the only variable that can accommodate this is sound masking. During hours with high activity levels, the person would need more masking to maintain his or her privacy. At low activity levels, such as early evening hours, the person would like {{to be aware of the}} presence of others; the need for community partially outweighs the need for privacy, so masking levels need to be lower. If the building has roving security personnel after working hours, there is no need for privacy and the sound <b>masking</b> <b>level</b> should be minimized. Successful systems have a clock and a control function that will continually vary the <b>masking</b> <b>level</b> in small increments over twenty four hours and for each day of the week. There are two types. One in which the level variations are programmed in advance and one in which the actual activity sound levels are measured and the <b>masking</b> <b>level</b> is set automatically to create the needed privacy. See the programmed level control and the adaptive function listed above. Unsuccessful systems had an ON-OFF clock-controlled switch which is not recommended.|$|E

Because of this added capability, these systems have software that can adjust the <b>masking</b> <b>level</b> in zones, small groups of speakers or even individual speakers. Some also can adjust the masking spectrum to this level. Some of these systems have an available system zone map that identifies those zones or speakers that are to be modified. This function eliminates the need for older monitor panels, simplifies the facility managers tasks, and the expense of contractor visits.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the sound}} {{attenuation}} {{characteristics of the}} workstation pair are determined, {{it is necessary to}} determine whether sound masking is needed, and if so, how much. The figure on the right shows the final result for the design listed in the sections above. There are several variables. Voice level is first. Most people in offices speak at conversational (normal) levels. Raised levels can be used for speaker phone use. The gender of the speaker has only a small effect on intelligibility. The background level in the space is second. There are three choices. The first is a level and spectrum that is typical of well designed air handling systems. The second is the Walkaway Test. In an open area, a person reads text at normal voice levels and another backs away until he or she has difficulty understanding the text. The ceiling tile array can be used to determine the distance. That distance is entered and the typical background spectrum level is altered based on tests that had been made. The third is actual measurement. The level in dB(A) is entered and the typical background spectrum level is altered. The spectrum shape (not level) for the sound masking must be chosen. Choosing fixed opens a list of masking spectra used by various consultants and installers. from which the user must pick. The first two choices are the spectra shapes recommended in the sections above. A choice of Automatic allows the program to create a spectrum shape that attempts maximize privacy with minimum level. The privacy goal must then be entered as shown in the upper right. A choice of Confidential Privacy defaults to a Privacy Index (PI) of 95. A choice of Normal Privacy defaults to PI=80. The third choice permits any Privacy Index to be chosen as a goal. There are cases where the sound <b>masking</b> <b>level</b> is specified, so the fourth choice can be taken. At this point there are options for setting the <b>masking</b> <b>level.</b> The first is Tune; the chosen masking spectrum is visually adjusted in level until the chosen degree of privacy is obtained or the specified <b>masking</b> <b>level</b> is reached. Then the various privacy, level, and sound attenuation ratings are displayed. A second choice is available that performs the same task with each of the masking spectra in the database and displays the comparative results in a table.|$|E

50|$|ZONES: The {{number of}} places where the overall <b>masking</b> <b>level</b> can be set (generally in terms of dB(A)). Levels can be set along with the {{spectrum}} in some generators. It can also be set at each power amplifier attached {{to a number of}} masking speakers. The speakers can be further subdivided into zones with the use of multiple attenuators attached to each amplifier. Finally, each masking speaker should be capable of individual level control. In a sense, each speaker can be made into a separate zone. The primary purpose of such detailed control is to offset the variations of level caused by local geometric influences, such as air ducts. In some advanced systems, zone control can be done centrally.|$|E
50|$|The psycho-physiological {{tenet of}} sound therapy is that {{habituation}} occurs {{as a result}} of the brain perceiving the tinnitus just above the threshold of the masking sound. Thus the masking sound level is set at what is called the 'mixing <b>masking</b> <b>level</b> (MML)' just below the perceived level of the tinnitus, resulting in only partial masking. However, at least one study has invalidated this tenet, finding that complete masking is just as effective as partial masking. The masker is usually worn for 8 hours a day for 6 months or longer. The sound used in therapy is generally from a specialized sound generator, either worn on or over the ear, or on the table. The type of sound is either broadband white noise or tailored background music.The use of a portable music player as a control instrument in TRT has produced successful results in recent analysis, offering patients a more cost-efficient treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Normal speech {{privacy is}} very {{difficult}} to achieve in corner workstations with panel heights between 60 and 66 inches and with the masking levels recommended above. Workstations along a wall have reduced privacy due to the wall and the wall-ceiling reflection. For workstations away from major reflecting surfaces the table on the right gives some guidance for what can be achieved with the three key factors of panel STC, ceiling NRC, and sound <b>masking</b> <b>level.</b> A high STC rating of a panel is not needed for low panels, the weakest path is the sound over it. There are three general classes of ceilings. The more common and less expensive ones have ratings from 0.55 to 0.65. The high performance ones have ratings between 0.65 and 0.85, and the more expensive fiberglass tiles have higher ratings.

50|$|Listeners have privacy {{from only}} some of the {{surrounding}} persons, not all. Open office customer support centers are facilities that meet this requirement. A person has no privacy from those nearby, but has privacy from those further away. Because this is distance related, a term called Radius of Distraction (RofD) was developed by Thomas Koenig of Dynasound to identify the transition to Normal Privacy (AI<0.2, PI>80). Although the radius is not a perfect circle because of the directivity of the human voice, it does permit the Area of Distraction to be determined. It is the area in which listeners are likely to be distracted by a talker's voice. Since the radius depends on the direction the talker is facing, use of RofD is restricted here to the direction the talker is facing (worst case). Knowing approximate workstation size, the number of distracted persons can be estimated from this area. In terms of A-weighted levels, a talker facing a listener is about 10 dBA louder than when he or she is facing away. Since speech intelligibility is of concern for the Radius of Distraction, voice directivity can be used to calculate it. The distance at which the Privacy Index reaches 80 with a male normal voice, a nine foot high, NRC 0.55, ceiling, and a sound <b>masking</b> <b>level</b> of 46 dBA was calculated and is shown in the figure on the right. Each circle is a five-foot increment. The radius in the talker's direction is about 38 feet while behind is only 10 feet. The considerably smaller area is that for a male casual voice. The RofD and Area of Distraction for several voice levels are shown in the table on the left. It is clear that voice level is the critical factor in Partial Privacy situations where there are no separating panels of acoustically significant height. Without sound masking, the RofD is on the order of 41 feet, covering about 2250 square feet. The beneficial effect of sound <b>masking</b> <b>level</b> on RofD is shown in the figure on the right. The value of the improvement can be better appreciated by estimating the Area of Distraction with the formula: 1.3 times the square of the radius.|$|E
50|$|The {{first task}} is to choose the various {{elements}} that pertain to acoustical privacy. There are three materials {{that need to be}} chosen: the ceiling, the panels or walls, and the carpeting. The program should contain a data base of acoustical characteristics for each of these materials. The figure on the right shows a typical modeling screen for an office design. The chosen ceiling had an NRC of 0.98 (fiberglass), the panels had an STC of 24, an NRC of 0.75 and all were 66 inches high. The carpet was wear resistant and the ceiling height was chosen to be a common 9 feet. The workstation size and the occupant positions are as shown in the figure. The occupants could be made to face in various directions. No wall or window reflections were present in this design, nor did the workstation have panel shelving. It was possible to add one of three light fixture types at any location in the ceiling. This program had a Quick Analysis button that gave the final degree of privacy and the required <b>masking</b> <b>level</b> quickly with no details; the purpose being to detect poor designs before detailed analysis was made.|$|E

50|$|Spatial {{uniformity}} of sound masking in, or between, closed offices is not generally a concern. How is spatial uniformity {{in an open}} office defined? There are two ways: (1) require that the overall A-weighted sound level be reasonably constant over a specific area, and; (2) require that variations in the masking spectrum be minimized. Most successful systems use the former requirement; strict spatial {{uniformity of}} the spectrum is exceedingly difficult to achieve except when phasing is of concern (see Phasing below). Uniformity of sound masking is only important {{in areas that are}} geometrically and uniformly similar. In some zones, panel heights are different and the requirement for uniformity of speech privacy may suggest <b>masking</b> <b>level</b> differences. Also there are conditions that suggest deliberate level changes (See Soundscaping below). Deviations from uniformity must be done carefully. Early requirements were for detailed measurements in a number of workstations that showed the level variations were below a certain number, such as +/- 2 dB(A). Most workstation occupants are more concerned with the sound from others and are willing to accept some level variations within their own area. Successful systems are those in which the aisles where persons walk meet uniformity requirements; changes there occur more rapidly and so are more noticeable. Uniformity is best accomplished by proper placement of the masking speakers during installation and inspection and adjustment of the equipment prior to occupancy.|$|E
50|$|TL is the {{transmission}} loss in decibels, MS and BS are respectively masking and ambient sound levels in decibels. The speech weighting factors W are those listed with Articulation Index. The first two ratings {{account for the}} high sound loss at frequencies that are important for intelligibility. ESL treats {{the difference between the}} masking spectrum and the background spectrum as an additional loss. The figure on the right shows the Speech Loss for a furniture panel with high STC; it is the excess loss caused by sound diffraction over the panel. The Effective Speech Loss is higher and shows sound masking as if it were part of the partition. The <b>masking</b> <b>level</b> for this example was set at 47 dB(A) and the background level was 39 dB(A). This graph demonstrates the significant value of sound masking when it acts as an additional panel height. It is clear that the level used in the graph only would be necessary for low panel heights, but is excessive with higher panels. The graph also demonstrates the panel tradeoff with sound masking. Adding masking permits lower panels to achieve the same speech loss. Adding masking roughly permits a reduction of at least 12 inches in panel height so there can be a significant cost savings.The reflection of speech from a ceiling in an open office depends on the sound absorbing characteristics of the ceiling tile and the height of the suspended ceiling. Because ceiling tiles tend to absorb the higher frequencies better, the speech loss is relatively good, as seen in the figure on the right. It should be noted that an upgrade in NRC rating adds expense but not always appreciable speech privacy improvement. A goal of SL=20 for the ceiling would require the panel height to be at least 60-66 inches to balance the two paths with added masking, otherwise, the panel would be the weakest sound path. Higher ceilings also increase sound diffusion for masking speakers in the ceiling plenum, increasing acceptability.|$|E
