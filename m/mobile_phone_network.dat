5|$|Several {{features}} and accessories were {{developed for the}} WonderSwan. The WonderWitch is an official software development kit aimed at amateur programmers that was released by Qute Corporation. It sold {{at a cost of}} ¥11,800 and allows for games to be developed in the C programming language. An adapter was created to connect headphones to the handheld, as the WonderSwan lacks a headphone port. A remote-controlled robot known as the WonderBorg can be operated through the unit. In addition, the handheld can be connected to a PocketStation, a memory card peripheral for the PlayStation console, through a device known as the WonderWave. The WonderSwan and its later models were also capable of connecting to the internet via a <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> <b>network.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{datalink}} for Malaysia Airline's avionics {{communications at}} the time of the incident was supplied by SITA, which contracted with Inmarsat to provide a satellite communication link using Inmarsat's Classic Aero service. Aeronautical satellite communication (SATCOM) systems are used to transmit messages from the aircraft cockpit as well as automated messages from on-board systems using the ACARS communications protocol, but may also be used to transmit FANS and ATN messages and provide voice, fax, and data links using other protocols. An appropriate comparison of ACARS' relationship to the SATCOM system is that of a messaging application to a smartphone; the smartphone functions and will remain registered on a <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> <b>network</b> even if the messaging application is closed.|$|E
5|$|Madhavan is {{amongst the}} leading brand ambassadors for {{products}} in India. His early work involved advertisements for brands including Bajaj, Ponds, Fair and Lovely and TVS, before signing a major endorsing deal with Pepsi and marketing company, IMG. In 2007, Madhavan endorsed UniverCell, a multi-brand mobile phone retail chain owned by UniverCell Telecommunications India Pvt Ltd. Madhavan {{signed a contract}} with the <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> <b>network,</b> Airtel for promotions in South India before being promoted as the pan-Indian ambassador for the brand a year later. His advertisements with Vidya Balan for Airtel won critical acclaim, and brought in film offers for the pair to feature together. In June 2010, marketers from Arun Excello promoted a housing project in Oragadam, Chennai in a similar fashion to the release of a new film featuring Madhavan. With film-inspired posters and billboards put up around Chennai, the advertisement campaign attracted huge curiosity and the project became a success. His long-term work with jewellery brand, Joy Alukkas, led to the company creating life size wax models of him to place in their showrooms from January 2011. Maruti Suzuki, for whom Madhavan is the brand ambassador, launched a special edition of the Suzuki Wagon R car calling it the Madhavan Signature Edition in September 2013. In 2015, online market place Snapdeal signed on Aamir Khan and Madhavan to be the company's ambassadors, with Snapdeal attempting to use Madhavan's popularity in South India to marker their services.|$|E

To investigate malware in this new environment, we have developed an event-driver simulator that captures the characteristics and constraints of <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> <b>networks.</b> In particular, the simulator models realistic topologies and provisioned capacities of the network infrastructure, {{as well as the}} contact graphs determined by cell phone address books. We evaluate the speed and severity of random contact worms in <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> <b>networks,</b> characterize the denial-of-service effects such worms could have on the network, investigate approaches to accelerate malware propagation, and discuss the implications of defending networks against such attacks...|$|R

The company's UniTRX chipsets are highly integrated, low-power RFICs for wideband radio modules that operate in the 400MHz to 4GHz frequency range. These solutions address the performance requirements of 3GPP and 3GPP2 macro base station radio transceivers and support multiple standards such as MC-GSM, cdma2000®, WCDMA, and LTE.|$|E
25|$|A {{firmware}} rootkit uses device or platform firmware {{to create}} a persistent malware image in hardware, such as a router, network card, hard drive, or the system BIOS. The rootkit hides in firmware, because firmware is not usually inspected for code integrity. John Heasman demonstrated the viability of firmware rootkits in both ACPI firmware routines and in a PCI expansion card ROM. In October 2008, criminals tampered with European credit card-reading machines before they were installed. The devices intercepted and transmitted credit card details via a <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> <b>network.</b> In March 2009, researchers Alfredo Ortega and Anibal Sacco published details of a BIOS-level Windows rootkit that was able to survive disk replacement and operating system re-installation. A few months later they learned that some laptops are sold with a legitimate rootkit, known as Absolute CompuTrace or Absolute LoJack for Laptops, preinstalled in many BIOS images. This is an anti-theft technology system that researchers showed can be turned to malicious purposes.|$|E
25|$|Matthew's {{strong winds}} knocked {{power lines and}} cell towers, which limited {{communications}} {{in the days following}} the storm, and left about 80% of the Tiburon Peninsula without power. A damaged antenna cut communications with Sud, and there were interruptions to the Digicel <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> <b>network.</b> Excessive flooding along 13watersheds, as well as the heavy forestry damage, killed many forest and fruit species. The flooding produced mudslides that washed out roads and bridges. Along Route Nationale #2, the hurricane washed away the Petit-Goâve Bridge, which is the only bridge linking the nation's capital Port-au-Prince with southwestern Haiti. This meant that relief workers and supplies temporarily had to travel by air to reach the most affected areas. A temporary bridge to transport humanitarian relief was constructed by October6. Across southern Haiti, the hurricane damaged 70% of the polling locations for the Haitian presidential election scheduled for October9; {{as a result of the}} storm, the election was postponed to an undetermined date on October5. Nationwide, Matthew damaged over 400schools, while 150other schools functioned as shelters for around 16,000evacuees. Damage to schools affected about 130,000children, many of whom had just started their school year, and were in need of a new location for their education. Of the nation's 15main hospitals, one was destroyed and another four were damaged, with 35medical clinics damaged, many of these were understaffed and unable to cope with the number of incoming patients.|$|E

Landlines are mostly used by government institutions, banks, NGOs and embassies, with private subscription levels low. , mobile phone penetration {{in the country is}} 72.6%, up from 41.6% in 2011. MTN Rwanda is the leading provider, with 3,957,986 subscribers, followed by Tigo with 2,887,328, and Bharti Airtel with 1,336,679. Rwandatel has also previously operated a <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> <b>network,</b> but the industry regulator revoked its licence in April 2011, following the company's failure to meet agreed investment commitments. Internet penetration is low but rising rapidly; in 2015 there were 12.8 internet users per 100 people, up from 2.1 in 2007. In 2011, a [...] fibre-optic telecommunications network was completed, intended to provide broadband services and facilitate electronic commerce. This network is connected to SEACOM, a submarine fibre-optic cable connecting communication carriers in southern and eastern Africa.
