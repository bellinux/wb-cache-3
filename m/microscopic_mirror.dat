5000|$|Optical {{rotation}} or {{optical activity}} (sometimes {{referred to as}} rotary polarization) is {{the rotation of the}} plane of polarization of linearly polarized light as it travels through certain materials. Optical activity occurs only in chiral materials, those lacking <b>microscopic</b> <b>mirror</b> symmetry. Unlike other sources of birefringence which alter a beam's state of polarization, optical activity can be observed in fluids. This can include gases or solutions of chiral molecules such as sugars, molecules with helical secondary structure such as some proteins, and also chiral liquid crystals. It can also be observed in chiral solids such as certain crystals with a rotation between adjacent crystal planes (such as quartz) or metamaterials. Rotation of light's plane of polarization may also occur through the Faraday effect which involves a static magnetic field, however this is a distinct phenomenon that is not usually classified under [...] "optical activity." ...|$|E
40|$|A {{proposed}} {{holographic memory}} {{system would be}} capable of storing data at unprecedentedly high density, and its data transfer performance in both reading and writing would be characterized by exceptionally high bandwidth. The capabilities of the proposed system would greatly exceed even those of a state-of-the art memory system, based on binary holograms (in which each pixel value represents 0 or 1), that can hold. 1 terabyte of data and can support a reading or writing rate as high as 1 Gb/s. The storage capacity of the state-of-theart system cannot be increased without also increasing the volume and mass of the system. However, in principle, the storage capacity could be increased greatly, without significantly increasing the volume and mass, if multilevel holograms were used instead of binary holograms. For example, a 3 -bit (8 -level) hologram could store 8 terabytes, or an 8 -bit (256 -level) hologram could store 256 terabytes, in a system having little or no more size and mass than does the state-of-the-art 1 -terabyte binary holographic memory. The proposed system would utilize multilevel holograms. The system would include lasers, imaging lenses and other beam-forming optics, a block photorefractive crystal wherein the holograms would be formed, and two multilevel spatial light modulators in the form of commercially available deformable-mirror-device spatial light modulators (DMDSLMs) made for use in high speed input conversion of data up to 12 bits. For readout, the system would also include two arrays of complementary metal oxide/semiconductor (CMOS) photodetectors matching the spatial light modulators. The system would further include a reference-beam sterring device (equivalent of a scanning mirror), containing no sliding parts, that could be either a liquid-crystal phased-array device or a <b>microscopic</b> <b>mirror</b> actuated by a high-speed microelectromechanical system. Time-multiplexing and the multilevel nature of the DMDSLM would be exploited to enable writing and reading of multilevel holograms. The DMDSLM would also enable transfer of data at a rate of 7. 6 Gb/s or perhaps somewhat higher...|$|E
25|$|<b>Microscopic</b> <b>mirrors</b> are a core {{element of}} many of the largest high-definition {{televisions}} and video projectors. A common technology of this type is Texas Instruments' DLP. A DLP chip is a postage stamp-sized microchip whose surface is an array of millions of <b>microscopic</b> <b>mirrors.</b> The picture is created as the individual mirrors move to either reflect light toward the projection surface (pixel on), or toward a light absorbing surface (pixel off).|$|R
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of Liquid Fidelity over DLP {{is that the}} 1080p Liquid Fidelity chip has over 2 million cells, {{in an array of}} 1920 x 1080, for true 1080p pixel resolution. The 1080p DLP chips designed for consumer HDTVs have only half that number of <b>microscopic</b> <b>mirrors,</b> and use yet another mechanism to create 2 pixels from each of those mirrors.|$|R
50|$|DLP uses MEMS technology, {{which stands}} for Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems. DLP HDTV chips include {{hundreds}} of thousands of <b>microscopic</b> <b>mirrors</b> which tilt back and forth, reflecting light which is then projected onto a television screen. While Liquid Fidelity creates an HDTV image by controlling the amount of light reflecting from it, DLP creates an HDTV image by varying the percentage of the time that its mirrors are aimed toward the projection screen.|$|R
50|$|A DMD chip has on {{its surface}} several hundred {{thousand}} <b>microscopic</b> <b>mirrors</b> arranged in a rectangular array which correspond to the pixels in the image to be displayed. The mirrors can be individually rotated ±10-12°, to an on or off state. In the on state, light from the projector bulb is reflected into the lens making the pixel appear bright on the screen. In the off state, the light is directed elsewhere (usually onto a heatsink), making the pixel appear dark.|$|R
5000|$|Digital Light Processing or DLP {{technology}} is a trademarked technology from Texas Instruments. The DLP chip contains a rectangular array of up to 2 million hinge-mounted <b>microscopic</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Each of the micromirrors measures less than one-fifth {{the width of a}} human hair. A DLP chip's micromirror tilts either toward the light source in a DLP projection system (ON) or away from it (OFF). This creates a light or dark pixel on the projection surface. Current DLP projectors use a quickly rotating wheel with transparent colored [...] "pie slices" [...] to present each color frame successively. One rotation shows the complete image.|$|R
40|$|Digital micromirror device (DMD) is {{an array}} of <b>microscopic</b> <b>mirrors</b> {{fabricated}} with the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technologies. In this paper, a pixilated programmable imaging system [...] DMD camera [...] based on the MEMS technology is developed. The DMD camera comprises a DMD, an image sensor and two imaging lenses. Individual DMD mirrors correspond to CCD pixels by moiré methodology. In the DMD camera optics, individual DMD mirrors operate as controllable high-speed shutters for corresponding CCD pixels by changing binary on-off pattern. Furthermore, the exposure time of each CCD pixel can be adjusted by displaying DMD pattern as grayscale. As a result, all phase-shifting images can be obtained within one frame time of a conventional CCD camera, and each pixel can be exposed to be the optimum time for phase analysis. Several applications to fringe pattern analysis using the DMD camera are reported. Experimental results demonstrated {{the effectiveness of the}} DMD camera as a novel image acquisition device for fringe pattern analysis...|$|R
25|$|The Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) is a {{silicon chip}} {{of up to}} 2 million hinged <b>microscopic</b> {{aluminum}} <b>mirrors</b> all under digital control that tilt thousands of times per second {{in order to create}} an image by directing digital pulses through a projection lens and onto a television or movie theatre screen. The Digital Micromirror Device was invented by Dr. Larry Hornbeck while working at Texas Instruments, also holding several patents relating to DMD technology.|$|R
50|$|TI's {{technology}} {{is based on}} the use of digital micromirror devices (DMDs). These devices are manufactured from silicon using similar technology to that of computer memory chips. The surface of these devices is covered by {{a very large number of}} <b>microscopic</b> <b>mirrors,</b> one for each pixel, so a 2K device has about 2.2 million mirrors and a 4K device about 8.8 million. Each mirror vibrates several thousand times a second between two positions: In one, light from the projector's lamp is reflected towards the screen, in the other away from it. The proportion of the time the mirror is in each position varies according to the required brightness of each pixel. Three DMD devices are used, one for each of the primary colors. Light from the lamp, usually a Xenon similar to those used in film projectors with a power between 1 kW and 7 kW, is split by colored filters into red, green and blue beams which are directed at the appropriate DMD. The 'forward' reflected beam from the three DMMDs is then re-combined and focused by the lens onto the cinema screen.|$|R
5000|$|Digital Light Processing (DLP) {{projector}}: A DLP projector {{creates an}} image using a digital micromirror device (DMD chip), which {{on its surface}} contains a large matrix of <b>microscopic</b> <b>mirrors,</b> each corresponding to one pixel in an image. Each mirror can be rotated to reflect light such that the pixel appears bright, or the mirror can be rotated to direct light elsewhere and make the pixel appear dark. The mirror is made of aluminum and is rotated on an axle hinge. There are electrodes {{on both sides of}} the hinge controlling the rotation of the mirror using electrostatic attraction. The electrodes are connected to an SRAM cell located under each pixel, and charges from the SRAM cell drive the movement of the mirrors. Color is added to the image-creation process either through a spinning color wheel (used with a single-chip projector) or a three-chip (red, green, blue) projector. The color wheel is placed between the lamp light source and the DMD chip such that the light passing through is colored and then reflected off a mirror to determine the level of darkness. A color wheel consists of a red, green, and blue sector, as well as a fourth sector to either control brightness or include a fourth color. This spinning color wheel in the single-chip arrangement can be replaced by red, green, and blue light-emitting diodes (LED). The three-chip projector uses a prism to split up the light into three beams (red, green, blue), each directed towards its own DMD chip. The outputs of the three DMD chips are recombined and then projected.|$|R

5000|$|DLP rear-projection television: A DLP {{projector}} {{creates an}} image using a digital micromirror device (DMD chip), which {{on its surface}} contains a large matrix of <b>microscopic</b> <b>mirrors,</b> each corresponding to one pixel (or sub-pixel) in an image. Each mirror can be tilted to reflect light such that the pixel appears bright, or the mirror can be tilted to direct light elsewhere (where it is absorbed) to make the pixel appear dark. Mirrors flip between light and dark positions, so subpixel brightness is controlled by proportionally varying {{the amount of time}} a mirror is in the bright position; its pulse-width modulation. The mirror is made of aluminum and is mounted on a torsion-supported yoke. There are electrodes {{on both sides of the}} yoke that control the tilt of the mirror using electrostatic attraction. The electrodes are connected to an SRAM cell located under each pixel, and charges from the SRAM cell move the mirrors. Color is created by a spinning color wheel (used with a single-chip projector) or a three-chip (red, green, blue) projector. The color wheel is placed between the lamp light source and the DMD chip such that the light passing through is colored and then reflected off the mirror array to determine brightness. A color wheel consists of a red, green, and blue sector, as well as a fourth sector to either control brightness or include a fourth color. This spinning color wheel in the single-chip arrangement can be replaced by red, green, and blue light-emitting diodes (LED).
