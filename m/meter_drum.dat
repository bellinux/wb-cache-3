50|$|Aqueduct is a Seattle, Washington-based indie pop band {{originally}} hailing from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Initially {{the band}} was a one-man act, created and produced by David Terry in his bedroom. Supporting members have more recently {{been added to the}} group. Aqueduct has played with Seattle bands United State of Electronica, Modest Mouse, and Death Cab for Cutie among others. They have received praise for their application of synthpop <b>meter,</b> <b>drum,</b> and piano, which has become more complex as the band has grown in membership.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to compare the performance of strength in small model of deep soft stabilized lime clay with a comparable remolded sample; furthermore to investigate the relationship between production rate of pozzolanic material and its impact on developing strength. Two trial phases were conducted using kaolin as a row material. The first try was carried out under amount of standard packing pressure (SPp) which is enough to form a 50 x 100 mm remolded sample. The second try was conducted under 50 % of SPp. Sampled of the small model, the 100 % SPP and the 50 % SPP were crushed at curing times of 7, 28 and 56 days. There were 6 samples for each different dosage of additive ranging between 6 % and 24 %. Also, a scaled field model comparable to the in situ condition was created to determine the undrained shear strength in order to associate with the remolded sample using the same stabilized soft clay. The model consist of 8 columns, 100 mm in diameter and was installed in a 1. 1 <b>meter</b> <b>drum.</b> Columns with different dosage of additive were pulled out for testing after 28, 56, 90 and 120 day curing periods. It was found that stabilized soft clay in long term duration would create the particle interaction due to physicochemical changes in the sample. Also increasing the additive dosag...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, {{when working}} on her second album, Amerie enlisted the {{services}} of producer Rich Harrison, who had helped produce and write her first album. In May 2004, Harrison heard [...] "Oh, Calcutta!" [...] {{for the first time}} and began working on the beat accompanying the ten-second back-and-forth breakdown between <b>Meters</b> <b>drummer</b> Ziggy Modeliste and guitarist Leo Nocentelli. Harrison said he loved the work of the Meters, especially Modeliste, commenting, [...] "Ziggy, he's crazy." [...] He processed the way the breakdown could be [...] "flipped", added a bongo drum, a cowbell, and a ride cymbal, and sent it to Amerie. According to Harrison, they wrote and finished the song in two to three hours.|$|R

40|$|The Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Operational Health Physics Group in {{conjunction}} with the Nuclear Materials Technology Division Waste Management Group has developed a wraparound shield for use with 55 -gallon (0. 208 cubic <b>meter)</b> <b>drums</b> containing transuranic (TRU) waste. The shield or 'drum cover' as it is called, is innovative in its ability to shield both neutron and gamma photons associated with TRU waste. The shielding materials are comprised of a 0. 275 -inch (7 mm) thick sheet of borated polyurethane for neutrons, and two sheets of composite lead vinyl fabric (equivalent to 0. 35 mm of lead) for shielding photons. The drum covers have proven their relative effectiveness. Shielding tests have shown that the drum covers are highly effective in attenuating photons and are somewhat effective for shielding neutrons. Total (neutron and photon) radiation reduction for actual TRU drurns has been as high as 87 %...|$|R

50|$|Jazz-rock fusion's {{technically}} challenging guitar solos, bass solos and odd <b>metered,</b> syncopated <b>drumming</b> {{started to}} be incorporated in the technically focused progressive metal genre in the early 1990s. Progressive rock, with its affinity for long solos, diverse influences, non-standard time signatures and complex music had very similar musical values as jazz fusion. Some prominent examples of progressive rock mixed with elements of fusion is the music of Gong, Ozric Tentacles and Emerson, Lake & Palmer.|$|R
5000|$|In 1989 Art Neville, George Porter Jr. and Leo Nocentelli reunited as The <b>Meters,</b> adding <b>drummer</b> Russel Batiste Jr. {{to replace}} Zigaboo Modeliste. When Nocentelli left {{the group in}} 1994 they {{replaced}} him with guitarist Brian Stoltz, formerly of The Neville Brothers and renamed themselves The Funky Meters. They were referred to as [...] "the Funky Meters" [...] as early as 1989. They were billed as such when playing in a tiny venue at Bordeaux & Camp Street behind Le Bon Temps Roule.|$|R
5000|$|The Disco Biscuits {{launched}} {{into their own}} [...] "Rock Candy." [...] (Flavor Flav was originally scheduled to join the band, but he respectfully declined during the last week. So instead, Slick Rick came out and after Rock Candy, Rick and The Biscuits performed La Di Da Di. Rahzel was then booked, but could not make the gig due to a snowstorm in the Northeast). Dr. John, Toots Hibbert (Toots and Maytals), bassist George Porter Jr. (the Meters), guitarist Brian Stoltz (the <b>Meters),</b> and <b>drummer</b> Matt Abts (Gov't Mule) then took {{the stage for a}} set that included [...] "Right Place, Wrong Time", [...] "Pressure Drop" [...] and [...] "Hey Pocky Way," [...] with Widespread Panic keyboardist JoJo Hermann on the latter.|$|R
50|$|Stingless bees usually nest {{in hollow}} trunks, tree branches, {{underground}} cavities, or rock crevices, {{but they have}} also been encountered in wall cavities, old rubbish bins, water <b>meters,</b> and storage <b>drums.</b> Many beekeepers keep the bees in their original log hive or transfer them to a wooden box, as this {{makes it easier to}} control the hive. Some beekeepers put them in bamboos, flowerpots, coconut shells, and other recycling containers such as a water jug, a broken guitar, and other safe and closed containers.|$|R
5000|$|The Head-entrance is 27.56 meters {{wide and}} 14.91 meters deep with 17 columns, all {{decorated}} {{with flowers and}} figures. On {{the top of the}} gate of the Head-entrance hangs a tablet with words 陳氏書院, meaning [...] "Chen Clan Academy". On the sides of the gate sit stone mats and a pair of 2.25 <b>meter</b> high stone <b>drums.</b> River gods are painted in color on the gate. Inside the gate there are four double-side engraved screen. The main beams are decorated with birds, flowers, human figures plasters, bats and lions.|$|R
40|$|Field {{studies suggest}} that bedrock {{incision}} by granular flows may be the primary process cutting valleys in steep, unglaciated landscapes. The mechanisms of granular flow incision, however, are not well quantified. Here I present a suite of laboratory experiments describing processes and rates of bedrock erosion by granular flows. In the first study, experiments in a 56 cm diameter, 15 cm wide rotating drum test the hypothesis that bedrock erosion is related to grain inertial stresses which scale with shear rate and particle size. In 67 experimental runs, the eroded depth of the bedrock sample varied with inertial stresses in the granular flow to a power less than 1. 0, and inversely with the bedrock strength. The second study used a new debris flow flume facility comprised of a 4 -meter diameter, 80 -cm wide vertically rotating drum to measure mean and fluctuating normal forces {{at the base of}} granular flows. The mean bulk force scaled with the static weight of the flow, while the variance of the force was a function of grain diameter, flow velocity, and matrix fluid properties. I show that the square of the impulse, related to kinetic energy transferred to the bed from granular collisions, can be quantified as the variance of the force signal. My results provide the first quantitative relationships between a metric for the collisional energy at the boundary and measurable properties of field-scaled flows. In the third study, I measured erosion of synthetic bedrock samples in the 4 <b>meter</b> diameter <b>drum</b> to test three models for the relationship between bedrock erosion rate and measured basal forces: (1) erosion by impact wear resulting from forces due to bulk inertial solid stress (2) erosion by sliding wear scaled by bulk normal force (3) erosion by impact wear scaled by the square of the impulse exerted on the bed. Based on my experimental observations, I propose a debris flow erosion rule that includes components of both sliding and impact wear, whose relative importance is scaled by experimentally-tested variables. Finally, as part of my investigations of controls on boundary forces and bedrock wear, I observed grain segregation processes and fluid-sediment interactions that were previously undescribed in the literature. These included lateral oscillations of the flow front and the formation of asymmetric coarse-particle gyres. I documented the first order controls on segregation by particle size, boundary conditions, fluid content, and fluid viscosity...|$|R
