5|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, the episode {{was seen by}} approximately 12.2million viewers, a drop from the previous episode which garnered 15.5million viewers. Following its broadcast, the episode received mixed reviews from critics, but won an Annie award {{in the category of}} Best Animated Television Production. In 2007, the episode was released as part of The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season DVD box set, and a promotional poster for the episode was included in an exhibition in Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The episode's ending scene is one of series creator Matt Groening's favorite <b>moments</b> <b>on</b> The Simpsons. The episode has been credited with fostering a critical literacy towards religion and the Bible among its viewers.|$|E
5|$|Using these {{metal frames}} for taller buildings, however, meant exposing them to {{increased}} wind pressure. As a consequence, protective wind bracing {{had to be}} introduced, enabled {{by the work of}} Augustin-Jean Fresnel who produced equations for calculating the loads and <b>moments</b> <b>on</b> larger buildings. Metal-framed buildings were also vulnerable to fire and required special fireproofing. French engineers had made advances in this area in the early 19th century, and major breakthroughs came with the work of architect Peter Wight in the 1860s. Spurred on by the catastrophic fires in Chicago in 1871 and Boston in 1872, his findings were turned into a wide variety of patented fireproofing products during the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|While {{the rivalry}} was {{somewhat}} subdued by the lopsidedness {{of the two}} teams records, the rivalry did provide some <b>moments.</b> <b>On</b> April 15, Mets pitcher Matt Harvey drilled Chase Utley in the back, after a few Mets pitchers {{had been hit by}} the Phillies. On August 25, during a game at Citizens Bank Park Phillies coach Larry Bowa started yelling out of the dugout after a quick pitch by Mets reliever Hansel Robles while Darin Ruf was in the box not looking up and not ready for the pitch. Bowa also yelled at Mets 1st baseman Daniel Murphy over a perceived slight by Murphy's bat flip earlier in the game during a home run. Benches cleared as Bowa threatened Murphy with retaliation and was ultimately ejected from the game.|$|E

5|$|Saeed captained Iraq {{through the}} 1986 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in 1985, playing 8 matches and scoring 8 goals {{including}} four against Lebanon in two 6–0 wins for Iraq, a winning goal against Jordan in Iraq's 3–2 win, which was Saeed's 100th appearance with the senior national team. Iraq {{finished in the}} top of the Group 1B table at 6 points in the first round, getting qualified to the 1986 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC Second Round. Saeed scored two goals in Iraq's 3–2 away win over the UAE. They lost 2–1 in their home match which qualified them to the final round on away goals. Saeed also scored in Iraq's victorious match against Syria in Taif in which Iraq won 3–1 getting qualified for the first time of their history to the FIFA World Cup after ending their away match in a 0–0 draw. When the 1986 FIFA World Cup was about to start, there were some speculations about Saeed not being in Iraq's squad, due to his injury, but he joined the team in the last <b>moments.</b> <b>On</b> 4 June, Saeed played in Iraq's first match against Paraguay, where they were defeated by a single goal. After the match, Iraq's head coach, Evaristo de Macedo, discontinued Saeed from the squad, due to his former injury, and sent him back to Baghdad. Iraq lost their two other matches against Belgium and Mexico, getting knocked out from the group stage of the cup. Since then, Iraq was not able to qualify to the World Cup.|$|E

25|$|Four of {{the crew}} members: Brophy, {{navigator}} Robert Bodie, radio operator James Kelly and pilot de Breyne were hidden by the French and, except for Brophy, returned to England shortly after the crash. Vigars remained with the unconscious Friday and both were captured by the Germans, being interned until liberated by American troops. Brophy joined French Resistance fighters and, after joining a resistance unit to continue the fight on the ground behind enemy lines, returned to London in September 1944, where he learned of Mynarski's death. It was not until 1945 when Brophy was reunited with the rest {{of the crew}} that the details of his final <b>moments</b> <b>on</b> the aircraft were revealed.

50|$|In aerodynamics, the {{pitching}} <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> an airfoil {{is the moment}} (or torque) produced by the aerodynamic force on the airfoil if that aerodynamic force {{is considered to be}} applied, not at the center of pressure, but at the aerodynamic center of the airfoil. The pitching <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> the wing of an airplane is part of the total moment that must be balanced using the lift on the horizontal stabilizer. More generally, a pitching moment is any <b>moment</b> acting <b>on</b> the pitch axis of a moving body.|$|R

25|$|Equivalent {{airspeed}} (EAS) {{is defined}} as the speed at sea level that would produce the same incompressible dynamic pressure as the true airspeed at the altitude at which the vehicle is flying. An aircraft in forward flight is subject to the effects of compressibility. Likewise, the calibrated airspeed {{is a function of the}} compressible impact pressure. EAS, on the other hand, is a measure of airspeed that is a function of incompressible dynamic pressure. Structural analysis is often in terms of incompressible dynamic pressure, so that equivalent airspeed is a useful speed for structural testing. At standard sea level pressure, calibrated airspeed and equivalent airspeed are equal. Up to about 200 knots CAS and 10,000 ft (3,000 m) the difference is negligible, but at higher speeds and altitudes CAS must be corrected for compressibility error to determine EAS. The significance of equivalent airspeed is that, at Mach numbers below the onset of wave drag, all of the aerodynamic forces and <b>moments</b> <b>on</b> an aircraft are proportional to the square of the equivalent airspeed. The equivalent airspeed is closely related to the indicated airspeed shown by the airspeed indicator. Thus, the handling and 'feel' of an aircraft, and the aerodynamic loads upon it, at a given equivalent airspeed, are very nearly constant and equal to those at standard sea level irrespective of the actual flight conditions.|$|E
