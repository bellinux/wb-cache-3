5|$|Michaud {{suggests}} that humanity could be impacted by {{an influx of}} extraterrestrial science and technology {{in the same way}} that medieval European scholars were impacted by the knowledge of Arab scientists. Humanity <b>might</b> <b>at</b> first revere the knowledge as having the potential to advance the human species, and might even feel inferior to the extraterrestrial species, but would gradually grow in arrogance as it gained more and more intimate knowledge of the science, technology, and other cultural developments of an advanced extraterrestrial civilization.|$|E
5|$|In {{one of the}} interludes of The Loves of the Plants, {{the voice}} of the Poet, which would seem to be Darwin's voice as well, argues that poetry is meant to appeal to the senses, {{particularly}} vision. Darwin's primary tool for accomplishing this was personification. Darwin's personifications were often based on the classical allusions embedded with Linnaeus's own naming system. However, they were not meant to conjure up images of gods or heroes; rather, the anthropomorphized images of the plants depict more ordinary images. They also stimulate the readers' imaginations to assist them in learning the material and allow Darwin to argue that the plants he is discussing are animate, living things—just like humans. Darwin's use of personification suggests that plants are more akin to humans than the reader <b>might</b> <b>at</b> first assume; his emphasis on the continuities between mankind and plantkind contributes to the evolutionary theme that runs throughout the poem.|$|E

25|$|The notions {{above are}} not as {{unfamiliar}} as they <b>might</b> <b>at</b> first appear. The customary acceptance {{of the fact that}} any real number x has a decimal expansion is an implicit acknowledgment that a particular Cauchy sequence of rational numbers (whose terms are the successive truncations of the decimal expansion of x) has the real limit x. In some cases {{it may be difficult to}} describe x independently of such a limiting process involving rational numbers.|$|E

25|$|One <b>might</b> <b>at</b> first {{imagine that}} the economy of {{argument}} involved with the Kurgan solution should oblige us to accept it outright. But critics do exist and their objections can be summarized quite simply– {{almost all of the}} arguments for invasion and cultural transformations are far better explained without reference to Kurgan expansions, and most of the evidence so far presented is either totally contradicted by other evidence or is the result of gross misinterpretation of the cultural history of Eastern, Central, and Northern Europe.|$|E
25|$|Bookbinding is {{an artistic}} craft of great antiquity, {{and at the}} same time, a highly {{mechanized}} industry. The division between craft and industry is not so wide as <b>might</b> <b>at</b> first be imagined. It is interesting to observe that the main problems faced by the mass-production bookbinder are the same as those that confronted the medieval craftsman or the modern hand binder. The first problem is still how to hold together the pages of a book; secondly is how to cover and protect the gathering of pages once they are held together; and thirdly, how to label and decorate the protective cover.|$|E
25|$|This pessimism {{has been}} {{tempered}} by research. Studies by Robert Haberle and Manoj Joshi of NASA's Ames Research Center in California {{have shown that}} a planet's atmosphere (assuming it included greenhouse gases CO2 and H2O) need only be 100 mbs, or 10% of Earth's atmosphere, for the star's heat to be effectively carried to the night side. This is well within the levels required for photosynthesis, though water would still remain frozen on the dark side in some of their models. Martin Heath of Greenwich Community College, has shown that seawater, too, could be effectively circulated without freezing solid if the ocean basins were deep enough to allow free flow beneath the night side's ice cap. Further research—including {{a consideration of the}} amount of photosynthetically active radiation—suggested that tidally locked planets in red dwarf systems <b>might</b> <b>at</b> least be habitable for higher plants.|$|E

25|$|For his part, the Emperor {{agreed not}} to attack him in case there was a common war against all Protestants. These {{arrangements}} for special terms led {{to the collapse of}} Philip's position as leader of the Protestant party. He had become an object of suspicion, and, although the league continued to remain in force, and gained some new adherents in succeeding years, its real power had dissipated. But while only Albrecht VII, Duke of Mecklenburg, and Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, of the secular princes were still faithful to the Roman Catholic cause, and while united action <b>might</b> <b>at</b> the time easily have resulted in the triumph of Protestantism, there was no union of purpose. Duke Maurice of Saxony and Joachim II of Brandenburg would not join the Schmalkaldic League; Cleves was successfully invaded by imperial troops; and Protestantism was rigorously suppressed in Metz.|$|E
25|$|But Jennings' {{principal}} {{role was}} as a tidy, dependable bowler, mainly in one-day cricket. His figures scarcely show many highlights, but his record of being consistently selected alongside stars such as Ian Botham, Joel Garner and Viv Richards indicates a value not measured in wickets. In 1978, he took 40 first-class wickets, the most he achieved in a season, and was awarded his county cap. The bowling included a return of five for 18 in 23.5 overs in the match against Sussex at Hove. That was his only five-wicket haul in senior cricket. Yet with all the stars available he was picked for both the crucial matches {{at the end of}} the season when it seemed that Somerset <b>might</b> <b>at</b> last win a trophy: in the event, the county lost both the Gillette Cup final to Sussex and the final John Player League match to Essex and missed out on both trophies.|$|E
25|$|From {{the time}} of the reign of the Antonine emperors, Roman art {{increasingly}} depicted battles as chaotic, packed, single-plane scenes presenting dehumanized barbarians mercilessly subjugated by Roman military <b>might,</b> <b>at</b> a time when in fact the Roman Empire was undergoing constant invasions from external threats that led to the fall of the empire in the West. Although armed, the barbarian warriors, usually identified as Goths, are depicted as helpless to defend themselves. Various aspects of the execution of the work accentuate the contrast between the Romans and the Goths. The Roman figures are all clean-shaven and wear armour and helmets, which distinguish them clearly from the Goths, who are unarmoured and wear distinctive clothing, beards, and hairstyles. The Romans are given a nobler appearance with idealised physical features which contrast with the Goths who are almost caricatures, with enlarged noses, pronounced cheekbones, and wild expressions on their faces. The alternation of light/dark accentuates the contrast between the two groups. Shadows and deep carving are mostly found in the faces and hair of the Goths whereas the smooth surface of the marble is reserved for the Romans, who are less deeply carved.|$|E

500|$|Herbert Samuel, the Zionist MP whose 1915 {{memorandum}} had {{framed the}} start of discussions in the British Cabinet, was asked by Lloyd George on 24April 1920 to act as the first civil governor of British Palestine, replacing the previous military administration that had ruled the area since the war. Shortly after beginning the role in July 1920, {{he was invited to}} read the haftarah from Isaiah 40 at the Hurva Synagogue in Jerusalem, which, according to his memoirs, led the congregation of older settlers to feel that the [...] "fulfilment of ancient prophecy <b>might</b> <b>at</b> last be at hand".|$|E
500|$|The next year, in 1885, Naval Academy {{officials}} finally {{approved of}} the playing of football. According to Morris Allison Bealle, [...] "Football at Annapolis had shed its swaddling clothes when the autumn of 1885 rolled around. Some of the faculty actually gave in and admitted that football <b>might,</b> <b>at</b> that, be or become an interesting diversion". After Navy won their opener and Hopkins split their record at 1–1, the two teams met again at the Naval Academy Thanksgiving Day athletic carnival. Johns Hopkins managed a 12–8 victory over the Academy, tying the series at two wins apiece.|$|E
500|$|Diefenbaker's {{intensive}} campaign exhausted {{the handful}} of national reporters who followed him. Clark Davey of The Globe and Mail stated, [...] "We {{did not know how}} he did it." [...] Reporters thought the Progressive Conservatives <b>might,</b> <b>at</b> best, gain 30 or 35seats over the 53 they had at dissolution, and when Diefenbaker, off the record, told the reporters that the Tories would win 97 seats (which would still allow the Liberals to form the government), they concluded he was guilty of wishful thinking. Diefenbaker was even more confident in public; after he concluded his national tour and returned to his constituency, he addressed his final rally in Nipawin, Saskatchewan: [...] "On Monday, I'll be Prime Minister." ...|$|E

500|$|From the Persian perspective, {{such terms}} {{would not be}} so humiliating as they <b>might</b> <b>at</b> first seem. The Persians already allowed the Greek cities of Asia to be governed under their own laws (under the {{reorganization}} conducted by Artaphernes, following the Ionian Revolt). By these terms, the Ionians were still Persian subjects, as they had been. Furthermore, Athens had already demonstrated their superiority at sea at the Eurymedon and Salamis-in-Cyprus, so any legal limitations for the Persian fleet were nothing more than [...] "de jure" [...] recognition of military realities. In exchange for limiting the movement of Persian troops in one region of the realm, Artaxerxes secured a promise from the Athenians to stay out of his entire realm.|$|E
500|$|The 1882 {{season began}} when second-year cadet Vaulx Carter formed a team, which he led {{as both a}} player and the coach. Alex Jackson was {{appointed}} captain of the squad. Carter scheduled a single game for the season, which was played on Thanksgiving Day against the Baltimore-based Clifton Football Club. The Clifton team {{was made up of}} players from Johns Hopkins University, who were unable to play for their school due to their administrator's negative views towards the sport. Navy's team itself played without official permission; the first year the team received approval was in 1885, when, according to Morris Allison Bealle, [...] "some of the faculty actually gave in and admitted that football <b>might,</b> <b>at</b> that, be or become an interesting diversion".|$|E
500|$|Marlborough {{returned}} to England on 14 December (O.S) to the acclamation of Queen Anne and the country. In {{the first days}} of January the 110 cavalry standards and the 128 infantry colours that were taken during the battle were borne in procession to Westminster Hall. In February 1705, Queen Anne, who had made Marlborough a Duke in 1702, granted him the Park of Woodstock and promised a sum of £240,000 to build a suitable house as a gift from a grateful crown in recognition of his victory – a victory which British historian Sir Edward Shepherd Creasy considered one of the pivotal battles in history, writing – [...] "Had it not been for Blenheim, all Europe <b>might</b> <b>at</b> this day suffer under the effect of French conquests resembling those of Alexander in extent and those of the Romans in durability." ...|$|E
