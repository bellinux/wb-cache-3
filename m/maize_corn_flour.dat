The second stage was the analysis of physicochemical properties of <b>corn</b> <b>flours</b> receiving steam pressure treatment for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 minutes. The third stage was the production of cookies using the pre-treated <b>corn</b> <b>flour.</b> Thermal properties evaluation of the <b>corn</b> <b>flour</b> showed that gelatinization temperatures (To, Tp, Tc) and gelatinization degrees (DG) increased but gelatinization enthalpy (ΔH) and temperature range (R) decreased as the time for steam pressure treatment increased. The rheological properties showed that maximum viscosity (PV), hot paste viscosity (HPV), breakdown viscosity (BV), cold paste viscosity (CPV) and setback viscosity (SV) of pre-treated <b>corn</b> <b>flour</b> decreased as the steam pressure treatment time increased. The steam pressure treatment changed the gelatinization profile from B to C type. Correlation analyses showed that the PV had positive correlation with swelling volume. The PV, HPV, BV, CPV and SV had negative correlation with the DG. The swelling volume and water solubility of the pre-treated <b>corn</b> <b>flour</b> were significantly affected by the steam pressure time. The swelling volume decreased but the water solubility increased. The steam pressure treatment did not give significant effects to water absorption capacity (WAC), amylose, amylopectin and moisture content of <b>corn</b> <b>flour.</b> The DG had positive correlation with the water solubility and the WAC but it had negative correlation with the swelling volume.

The average consumption of dry cake in the big city and village in Indonesia is 0. 40 kg/capita/year. Cookies processing do not need volume development as wet cake and bread, but the cookies have to be crispy, imperishable to water, hard and unbroken easily.

Maize flour has hard texture, relatively low gluten content (< 1 %) with amylograph features processing the cold viscosity (240  620 BU).
