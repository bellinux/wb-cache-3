The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the shear bond strength (SBS) of two commercial zirconia core ceramics to their corresponding veneering ceramics. Materials and Methods : Zirconia disks with 7 -mm diameter and 3 -mm height were prepared (Cercon and Biodenta systems) and veneered with recommended layering ceramics (Cercon ceram and 2 in 1 ceramic, respectively) (n = 10). The disks were polished with diamond paste and airborne-particle abraded before layering. The specimens were mounted in a T-shaped <b>metal</b> <b>holder</b> using autopolymerized acrylic resin and stored in 37 ΀C distilled water for one week, after which they were subjected to thermal cycling. SBS of zirconia core to veneering ceramic was measured using a universal testing machine and failure modes were determined microscopically. Data were analyzed using t test (α < 0. 05). Results : Mean (΁SD) SBS values were 27. 19 (΁ 3. 43) and 28. 22 (΁ 4. 08) MPa for Cercon and Biodenta systems, respectively, with no significant difference. Biodenta system showed more adhesive failure compared to more combined (adhesive and cohesive) failures in Cercon system. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study it can be concluded that SBS of Biodenta and Cercon specimens were nearly the same, but the fracture mode of these two systems were different. Since Biodenta fracture pattern was predominantly adhesive, it seems that maybe Biodenta porcelain was stronger than Cercon porcelain where as its adhesive bond was weaker...|$|E
40|$|Diamond {{smoothing}} tools {{have been}} proposed for use in conjunction with diamond cutting tools {{that are used in}} many finish-machining operations. Diamond machining (including finishing) is often used, for example, in fabrication of precise metal mirrors. A diamond smoothing tool according to the proposal would have a smooth spherical surface. For a given finish machining operation, the smoothing tool would be mounted next to the cutting tool. The smoothing tool would slide on the machined surface left behind by the cutting tool, plastically deforming the surface material and thereby reducing the roughness of the surface, closing microcracks and otherwise generally reducing or eliminating microscopic surface and subsurface defects, and increasing the microhardness of the surface layer. It has been estimated that if smoothing tools of this type were used in conjunction with cutting tools on sufficiently precise lathes, {{it would be possible to}} reduce the roughness of machined surfaces to as little as 3 nm. A tool according to the proposal would consist of a smoothing insert in a <b>metal</b> <b>holder.</b> The smoothing insert would be made from a diamond/metal functionally graded composite rod preform, which, in turn, would be made by sintering together a bulk single-crystal or polycrystalline diamond, a diamond powder, and a metallic alloy at high pressure. To form the spherical smoothing tip, the diamond end of the preform would be subjected to flat grinding, conical grinding, spherical grinding using diamond wheels, and finally spherical polishing and/or buffing using diamond powders. If the diamond were a single crystal, then it would be crystallographically oriented, relative to the machining motion, to minimize its wear and maximize its hardness. Spherically polished diamonds could also be useful for purposes other than smoothing in finish machining: They would likely also be suitable for use as heat-resistant, wear-resistant, unlubricated sliding-fit bearing inserts...|$|E

40|$|Ultrasound {{is being}} {{increasingly}} investigated for real-time target localization in image-guided interventions. Yet, in-vivo validation remains challenging {{due to the}} difficulty to obtain a reliable ground truth. For this purpose, real-time volumetric (4 D) ultrasound imaging was performed simultaneously with electromagnetic localization of three wireless transponders implanted in the liver of a radiotherapy patient. 4 D ultrasound and electromagnetic tracking were acquired at framerates of 12 Hz and 8 Hz, respectively, during free breathing over 8 min following treatment. The electromagnetic antenna was placed directly above and the ultrasound probe {{on the right side}} of the patient to visualize the liver transponders. It was possible to record 25. 7 s of overlapping ultrasound and electromagnetic position data of one transponder. Good spatial alignment with 0. 6 mm 3 D root-mean-square error between both traces was achieved using a rigid landmark transform. However, data acquisition was impaired since the electromagnetic tracking highly influenced the ultrasound equipment and vice versa. High intensity noise streaks appeared in the ultrasound scan lines irrespective of the chosen frequency (1. 7 - 3. 3 MHz, 2 / 4 MHz harmonic). To allow for target visualization and tracking in the ultrasound volumes despite the artefacts, an online filter was designed where corrupted pixels in the newest ultrasound frame were replaced with non-corrupted pixels from preceding frames. Aside from these artefacts, the recorded electromagnetic tracking data was fragmented and only the transponder closest to the antenna could be detected over a limited period of six consecutive breathing cycles. This problem was most likely caused by interference from the <b>metal</b> <b>holder</b> of the ultrasound probe and was solved in a subsequent experiment using a 3 D-printed non-metal probe fixation. Real-time wireless electromagnetic tracking was compared with 4 D ultrasound imaging in-vivo for the first time.

40|$|Organic light {{emitting}} devices (OLEDs) are {{light emitting}} devices consisting of a stack of organic semiconductors sandwiched by electrodes. Since the first report of a high-efficiency device by Tang and Van Slyke in 1987, OLEDs have attracted considerable attention, particularly for use in flat panel displays. OLEDs provide these products improved power consumption, contrast, response speed, viewing angle, and compatibility with flexible displays. The performance of OLEDs has improved considerably, {{especially in terms of}} stability and efficiency, so they can now meet the requirements for some display products. However, the commercialization of OLED displays remains limited and is hampered primarily by manufacturing issues. These issues include low manufacturing yield, high fabrication cost, and low display quality. Manufacturing issues are largely attributed to difficulties with the color patterning process, the fabrication process by which arrays of red, green and blue (RGB) OLEDs can be made side-by-side on one substrate in order to obtain a full-color display. Currently, RGB color patterning is done by sequential vacuum deposition of red, green and blue materials through a pre-patterned shadow mask, which is typically made of a thin metal sheet. This technique is widely known as fine metal mask (FMM) technology. However, this technique has several inherent limitations, including mask deformation, difficulties in mask-to-substrate overlay alignment, and ability to make masks with micrometer level dimensional accuracy. These limitations reduce the manufacturing yield, display resolution, and display aperture ratio (the ratio of the emissive area to the total surface area of a display). Despite the fact that several approaches for addressing these limitations in OLED displays have been proposed, there is still no commercially viable solution. In this thesis, two novel color patterning techniques for OLED displays are proposed. One approach utilizes laser-patterned polyimide (PI) sheets as shadow masks. This technique takes advantage of the good processability of PI by direct laser ablation, which makes it possible to cut through it to create slits with very high dimensional accuracies. In addition, because this is a dry process, the laser-patterning of the PI sheets can be done after the sheets are already stretched and mounted on the <b>metal</b> <b>holder.</b> This avoids post-patterning deformation of the masks by the stretching step. The use of laser also makes it possible to pattern the PI sheets after they have already been mounted on the thin film transistor (TFT) backplane substrates and thus, in a variant of this technique, allows for the shadow mask to be created in-situ. This in-situ shadow mask patterning technique can be expected to offer further accuracy advantages, since the slits are created by laser over the desired TFT locations directly, and thus eliminates the need for a subsequent mechanical alignment step. This approach can be particularly useful for RGB OLED patterning on flexible substrates where the poor mechanical and dimensional stability of substrates pose additional challenges for aligning shadow masks accurately. The other color patterning approach proposed here is based on the diffusion of a luminescent material from a donor substrate into the organic host material layer of the OLED that is pre-coated on the backplane substrate. The RGB color patterning in this case can be done without the use of shadow masks, so this approach offers significant advantages. The use of a pre-patterned micro stamp as the donor substrate allows the physical contact between the two substrates to be selectively limited to certain areas, which in turn allows limiting this diffusion to only certain areas of the OLED substrate. Such selective diffusion can also alternatively be done through local heating via electric currents, using electrodes in the OLED backplane for this purpose. This eliminates the need for patterned stamps and mechanical alignment. 	In this work, these two techniques are introduced and tested with the purpose of assessing their potential for RGB patterning. As part of this investigation, the effect of using these techniques on OLED performance is also studied. Finally, a first proof-of-concept utilization of the techniques for producing RGB OLEDs fabricated side-by-side on one substrate is demonstrated...|$|E
