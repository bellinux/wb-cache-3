60|$|Out {{from his}} dark retreat now came the trout, and {{settling}} quietly {{at the bottom}} of the brook, he appeared to regard the venturesome insect with a certain interest. But he must have detected the iron-barb of vice beneath the mask of blitheful innocence, for, after a short deliberation, the trout turned and disappeared under the bank. As he slowly moved away, he seemed to be bigger than ever. I must catch that fish! Surely he would bite at something. It was quite evident that his mind was not wholly unsusceptible to emotions emanating from an awakening appetite, and I believed that if he saw exactly what he wanted, he would not neglect an opportunity of availing himself of it. But what did he want? I must certainly find out. Drawing myself back again, I took off the yellow fly, and put on another. This was a white one, with black blotches, like a big <b>miller</b> <b>moth</b> which had fallen into an ink-pot. It was surely a conspicuous creature, and as I crept forward and sent it swooping over the stream, I could not see how any trout, with a single insectivorous tooth in his head, could fail to rise to such an occasion. But this trout did not rise. He would not even come out from under his bank to look at the swiftly flitting creature. He probably could see it well enough from where he was.|$|E
50|$|The Nihoa millerbird (Acrocephalus familiaris kingi) is a {{subspecies}} of the millerbird. It {{gets its}} name from its preferred food, the <b>Miller</b> <b>moth.</b> The 5 in long millerbird has dark, sepia-colored feathers, white belly, and dark beak. Its natural geographic range {{is limited to the}} tiny island of Nihoa in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, and it is hoped that birds translocated to Laysan will help to ensure the survival of the species. The Nihoa millerbird is one of the two endemic birds remaining on Nihoa, the other being the Nihoa finch.|$|E
50|$|Its {{caterpillars}} are pests of oat (Avena sativa) {{and common}} wheat (Triticum aestivum).The <b>miller</b> <b>moth</b> is a seasonal nuisance {{in the spring}} in states including Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico and Kansas, as they hatch in the low-lying farmlands, then migrate to higher elevations for the summer. They return as the weather cools but in smaller numbers. They are considered nearly impossible to control through normal pest extermination techniques because a new batch shows up every day as they migrate. With their very small bodies, they enter homes (attracted by the light) in the evening through any available crack or crevice (doorjamb, chimney, etc.) and residents in migration paths report dozens of moths per day entering their homes and garages. However, other than being a nuisance, they are not considered harmful.|$|E
50|$|Geraldocossus is a {{monotypic}} genus of moths in the Politzariellinae subfamily of {{the carpenter}} <b>miller</b> <b>moths.</b> Its sole species, Geraldocossus durrelli, {{is found in}} Cameroon. It is solely known from two male specimens.|$|R

50|$|The Cossidae, the cossid millers or {{carpenter}} millers, make up {{a family}} of mostly large <b>miller</b> <b>moths.</b> This family contains over 110 genera with almost 700 known species, and many more species await description. Carpenter millers are nocturnal Lepidoptera found worldwide, except the Southeast Asian subfamily Ratardinae, which is mostly active during the day.|$|R
50|$|The {{newspaper}} reports that Brooks Bailey, a cashier at Oakdale Bank, has robbed {{the bank of}} $200,000 and has disappeared. Van Gorder's niece, Miss Dale Ogden, arrives with a supposed new gardener. Van Gorder asks the gardener about his knowledge on alopecia, urticaria, and rubeola, and he answers as if the terms referred to plants rather than medical conditions. On the staircase, Richard is shot, and Miss Dale manages to snatch part of a blueprint of the house from his pocket. Detective Moletti accuses her of {{trying to find a}} supposed hidden room in the mansion that should be shown on the blueprint. Detective Anderson arrives, and the group gets a call from the house phone in the garage, which sounds like groans of distress. A circular light shines on the wall, with the shadow of a bat in its center, but after investigating, the group finds that the shape was caused by a <b>miller</b> <b>moth</b> on a car headlight.|$|E
50|$|The vulpina dagger <b>moth</b> or <b>miller</b> dagger <b>moth</b> (Acronicta vulpina) is a moth of the Noctuidae family. It {{is found}} from New York and Newfoundland west to central British Columbia, south to Colorado.|$|R
25|$|Although the diets of {{grizzly bears}} vary {{extensively}} based on seasonal and regional changes, plants {{make up a}} large portion of them, with some estimates as high as 80–90%. Various berries constitute an important food source when they are available. These can include blueberries, blackberries (Rubus fruticosus), salmon berries (Rubus spectabilis), cranberries (Vaccinium oxycoccos), buffalo berries (Shepherdia argentea), soapberries (Shepherdia canadensis), and huckleberries (Vaccinium parvifolium), depending on the environment. Insects such as ladybugs, ants, and bees are eaten if they are available in large quantities. In Yellowstone National Park, grizzly bears may obtain half of their yearly caloric needs by feeding on <b>miller</b> <b>moths</b> that congregate on mountain slopes. When food is abundant, grizzly bears will feed in groups. For example, many grizzly bears will visit meadows right after an avalanche or glacier slide. This is due to an influx of legumes, such as Hedysarum, which the grizzlies consume in massive amounts. When food sources become scarcer, however, they separate once again.|$|R
