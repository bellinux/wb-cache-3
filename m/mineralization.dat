40|$|ABSTRACT. - As {{result of}} {{geologic}} {{studies on the}} field and microscopic studies of the samples from Altıntepe and Çilektepe areas located southwest of Sancaklı village, Karşıyaka-İzmir, dacitic tuffs and lavas and their silicified types, biotite-hornblend-dacite. andesitic lava, tuff and agglomeras in addition to andesitic dykes are determined and mapped. Investigations indicate two dif-ferent type of <b>mineralizations,</b> First type is gold and silver <b>mineralizations</b> in quartz veins emplaced in tension fractures of silici-fied dacitic lavas at Altıntepe (Arapdağ) sector. The other kind of <b>mineralizations</b> is related to hydrothermal alterations in dacitic tuffs at Çilektepe (Çerkeskayası or Pilavtepe) sector. Gold <b>mineralizations</b> are developed as stockworks and disseminations in those kind of rocks because uprising channels are tapped by silica gels. The age of volcanism based on regional geological data is between Late Oligocene and Middle Miocene. Biotite-hornblende-dacites (14. 7 + 0. 5 Ma) contain no precious metal mineral-izations and are believed to occur after ore <b>mineralizations.</b> According to these findings, the <b>mineralizations</b> should be Middle Miocene in age...|$|R

5|$|Connective tissues are fibrous {{and made}} up of cells {{scattered}} among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, fibrous connective tissue, cartilage and bone. The extracellular matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is stiffened by <b>mineralization,</b> as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects. An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals, {{as well as in}} many of those less developed.|$|E
5|$|Medullary bone tissue (endosteally derived, ephemeral, <b>mineralization</b> located {{inside the}} medulla {{of the long}} bones in gravid female birds) has been {{reported}} in at least one Allosaurus specimen, a shin bone from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. Today, this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that are laying eggs, as it is used to supply calcium to shells. Its presence in the Allosaurus individual has been used to establish sex and show it had reached reproductive age. However, other studies have called into question some cases of medullary bone in dinosaurs, including this Allosaurus individual. Data from extant birds suggested that the medullary bone in this Allosaurus individual may have been the result of a bone pathology instead. However, with the confirmation of medullary tissue indicating gender in a specimen of Tyrannosaurus, {{it may be possible to}} ascertain whether or not the Allosaurus in question was indeed female.|$|E

Nair 1993 carried out the geomorphologic mapping combined with panning of Siruvani River {{which led to the}} discovery of primary gold <b>mineralization</b> in epigenetic quartz vein in Puttumala. The veining, <b>mineralization</b> and associated lithology of this deposit appear to be typical of greenstone-hosted lode gold deposit.

25|$|Whereas mantle dentin forms {{from the}} preexisting ground {{substance}} of the dental papilla, primary dentin forms through a different process. Odontoblasts increase in size, eliminating the availability of any extracellular resources to contribute to an organic matrix for <b>mineralization.</b> Additionally, the larger odontoblasts cause collagen to be secreted in smaller amounts, which results in more tightly arranged, heterogeneous nucleation that is used for <b>mineralization.</b> Other materials (such as lipids, phosphoproteins, and phospholipids) are also secreted.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. _ <b>Mineralizations</b> at Keban and its {{surroundings}} are generally observed at the contacts of granitoids and epimeta-morphic rocks, in Nimri formation and in Keban marbles. Lead-zinc <b>mineralizations</b> {{in this region}} are previously interpreted as skarn type occurrences associated with granitoids. In this study, predominantly carbonate <b>mineralizations</b> in the carbonate rocks of Nimri formation and sulphide and carbonate ores within the Keban marbles are investigated. As a result of mineralog-ical, petrographical and geochemical studies, some significant evidences indicate that the <b>mineralizations</b> are not directly relat-ed with the skarn type associated with granitoids. According to the limited data collected during this study, {{the view that the}} min-eralizations, present in Nimri formation and Keban marble, are mobilized with the influence of granitoids becomes significant. <b>Mineralizations</b> taking place earlier than mobilization are discussed by exhalative sedimentary (SEDEX) type and Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) relying on the present data. Some evidence is found for SEDEX type. While primary occurrences are getting their new positions by means of secondary processes, metallic contents of primary occurrences are enriched. Mobilizations re-lated with metamorphism and/or granitoid impact and enrichment processes caused by weathering are out of the study. The main result of this study is the necessity of new other revitalization of discussions about the origin of primary occurrences for contribution to science and economy...|$|R

25|$|Odontoblasts, the dentin-forming cells, {{differentiate}} from {{cells of the}} dental papilla. They begin secreting an organic matrix around the area directly adjacent to the inner enamel epithelium, closest {{to the area of}} the future cusp of a tooth. The organic matrix contains collagen fibers with large diameters (0.1–0.2μm in diameter). The odontoblasts begin to move {{toward the center of the}} tooth, forming an extension called the odontoblast process. Thus, dentin formation proceeds toward the inside of the tooth. The odontoblast process causes the secretion of hydroxyapatite crystals and <b>mineralization</b> of the matrix. This area of <b>mineralization</b> is known as mantle dentin and is a layer usually about 150μm thick.|$|E
