5|$|Europa Orbiter — Its {{objective}} {{would be}} to characterize {{the extent of the}} ocean and its relation to the deeper interior. Instrument payload could include a radio subsystem, laser altimeter, magnetometer, Langmuir probe, and a <b>mapping</b> <b>camera.</b> The Europa Orbiter received a go-ahead in 1999 but was canceled in 2002. This orbiter featured a special ice-penetrating radar that would allow it to scan below the surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{second major}} {{instrument}} was the MKF-6M multispectral camera, which carried out Earth-resources observations. An improved {{form of a}} camera first tested on Soyuz 22, the camera captured an area of 165220kilometres with each image, down to a resolution of 20metres. Each image was captured simultaneously in six bands in 1200-frame cassettes, which required regular replacement due to the fogging effects of radiation. Salyut 6 also featured a KATE-140 stereoscopic topographic <b>mapping</b> <b>camera</b> with a focal length of 140millimetres, which captured images of 450450kilometres with a resolution of 50metres in the visible and infrared spectra, which could be operated either remotely or by the resident crews. The photographic capabilities of the station were, therefore, extensive, and the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture had planted a number of specifically selected crops at test sites to examine {{the capabilities of the}} cameras.|$|E

In the final orbit reduction manoeuvre, Chandrayaan-1's aposelene and periselene were both reduced to 100km. In this orbit, Chandrayaan-1 takes about two hours {{to go around the}} Moon once. Two of the 11 payloads—the Terrain <b>Mapping</b> <b>Camera</b> (TMC) and the Radiation Dose Monitor (RADOM)—were successfully switched on. The TMC successfully acquired images of both the Earth and the Moon.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} achievements in digital photogrammetry in the last decade is the development of large format digital <b>mapping</b> <b>cameras.</b> In addition to large format digital <b>mapping</b> <b>cameras,</b> a number of medium format digital <b>mapping</b> <b>cameras</b> systems have also been developed. At Pictometry, a medium format digital imaging system has been developed and been widely used for acquisition of both vertical and oblique images around the world. Since oblique images exhibits rich 3 D like information of objects on ground, they are widely used in not only 3 D measurement and visualization, but also creation of 3 D city models. In this paper, Pictometry's proprietary medium format digital imaging system will be briefly introduced. Some issues in generation of 3 D city models using Pictometry digital oblique images will also be discussed. 1...|$|R

2500|$|TMC or the Terrain <b>Mapping</b> <b>Camera</b> is a CMOS {{camera with}} [...] {{resolution}} and a [...] swath in the panchromatic band {{and was used}} to produce a high-resolution map of the Moon. The aim of this instrument was to completely map the topography of the Moon. The camera works in the visible region {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} and captures black and white stereo images. When used in conjunction with data from Lunar Laser Ranging Instrument (LLRI), it can help in better understanding of the lunar gravitational field as well. TMC was built by the ISRO's Space Applications Centre (SAC) at Ahmedabad. The TMC was successfully tested on 29 October 2008 through a set of commands issued from ISTRAC.|$|E

40|$|Digital {{airborne}} photogrammetric imaging {{systems are}} operational and already have substituted the analogue <b>mapping</b> <b>cameras</b> {{in many countries}} and applications. The high potential of digital airborne imaging was already evaluated through several empirical tests. Compared to the former analogue <b>mapping</b> <b>cameras,</b> which all provide standard analogue images using one single optic only, the new digital airborne cameras follow very different sensor designs and processing concepts, which requests for flexible and system driven calibration and certification approaches. In situ calibrations obtained from well defined test ranges will {{play an important role}} in future system validation and certifications, still guidelines for optimal test site layout and evaluation concepts are almost missing. This motivates the European Spatial Data Organization (EuroSDR) to compile several projects first looking on the more technical aspects of radiometric and geometric digital airborne sensor system performance. From that optimal and operational in situ test site layouts and corresponding evaluation processes are derived, whose first concepts are presented in this paper. Both geometry and radiometric aspects are covered. This also is linked to other certification approaches like the US Geological Survey Digital Camera Quality Assurance Plan and to new national and international standards. 1...|$|R
