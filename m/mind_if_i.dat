When Officer Lang arrived at their row, he {{identified}} himself as a police investigator and showed his badge. In a voice [...] "just loud enough" [...] to hear, he said he was a police officer [...] "conducting bus interdiction , attempting to deter drugs and illegal weapons being transported on the bus". When Lang asked Drayton and Brown if they had any luggage on the bus, they both pointed to the same green bag on the overhead luggage rack. Lang asked, [...] "o you <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> check it?", and Brown replied, [...] "o ahead". The officers inspected the bag and discovered no contraband inside.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard {{characterized}} her composition {{style as}} [...] "impressionistic paintings in music", {{in an interview}} with the St. Petersburg Times. She commented, [...] "My music is for the time when people want to turn out the lights, listen and escape into another world ... to dream places ... to little magical places in which the listener can participate and become involved." [...] Regarding a potential audience, Hubbard said, [...] "My music is for intelligent listeners, who don't <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> change chords, and are willing to see what happens next." [...] Explaining why written text did not accompany the songs, Hubbard said, [...] "I wrote lots of poetry. But somehow it didn't feel right to have lyrics with the pieces – I'd rather leave that slot open for the listener." ...|$|E
500|$|American {{pop singer}} Nick Jonas sang an {{acoustic}} {{version of the}} song in July during his concert at the Westfield Century City in Los Angeles. Before the performance Jonas announced: [...] "Do you guys <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> play a couple of songs I like from pop radio right now? Would that be OK? The only problem is, I don't know all the words. So if you know them, sing along." [...] After watching the performance online, Gaga posted his cover on her Twitter account along with the words [...] "Swoon! Nick Jonas singing The Edge of Glory. On my way to press conference in Taichung, listening to it. So dreamy! X." [...] British band Friendly Fires covered the song during BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. Kevin O'Donnell of Spin praised their cover writing: [...] "Gaga's original showcases the pop star's gale force pipes, and Friendly Fires frontman Ed Macfarlane doesn't try to match that energy. Instead, they offer a lovely, cinematic take on the song: Macfarlane croons with the heart-on-sleeve sensitivity of an emo-boy over cascading synth melodies and a breezy funk pulse. Nice!" ...|$|E

500|$|Officer Lang {{observed}} that Drayton and Brown were wearing [...] "heavy jackets and baggy pants", despite warm weather that day. Lang suspected Brown and Drayton {{might have been}} using their baggy clothing to conceal weapons or drugs, so he asked Brown, [...] "o you <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> check your person?" [...] Brown responded, [...] "ure", leaned up in his seat, removed a cellular phone from his pocket, and opened his jacket. Lang patted down the outside of his clothing and felt small packages [...] "similar to drug packages detected on other occasions". Officer Lang then arrested Brown, handcuffed him, and Officer Hoover walked him off the bus. Lang then asked Drayton, [...] "ind if I check you?", to which Drayton responded [...] "by lifting his hands about eight inches from his legs". Lang detected similar objects during a pat down of Drayton's legs, placed him under arrest, and escorted him off the bus. A further search determined that Brown had duct-taped three bundles containing 483 grams of cocaine between several layers of boxer shorts, and Drayton had duct-taped two bundles between several layers of boxer shorts containing 295 grams of cocaine.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, Boy George {{released}} U Can Never B2 Straight, an [...] "unplugged" [...] {{collection of}} rare and lesser known acoustic works. It contained unreleased tracks from previous years {{as well as}} some ballads from Cheapness and Beauty and the Culture Club album Don't <b>Mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> Do. It received the best reviews of Boy George's solo career, many of them highlighting his strong song writing abilities. The record was only released in the UK and Japan, and reached No.147 on the UK album charts.|$|E

2500|$|In July 1998, a reunited Culture Club {{performed}} three {{dates in}} Monte Carlo and then joined the Human League and Howard Jones in a [...] "Big Rewind" [...] {{tour of the}} US. The following month, the band appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman and made an appearance in Britain, their first in 14 years. Later that year, the band hit the UK charts at No.4 with [...] "I Just Wanna Be Loved" [...] and later a top 25 hit with [...] "Your Kisses are Charity". A new Culture Club album, Don't <b>Mind</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> Do, was released in 1999 but was a commercial failure.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, George and Moss {{put their}} {{differences}} aside {{and the band}} reunited to do a reunion tour, kicking off with a performance on VH1 Storytellers. George said about the reunion, [...] "Culture Club's reunion couldn't {{have come at a}} better time for rock", adding that, [...] "It's a nostalgia trip, there's no way of avoiding that." [...] The tour was a major success. Greatest Moments, a compilation album based around the Storytellers performance, was released, and went platinum in UK. It included new songs such as [...] "I Just Wanna Be Loved", which hit UK No.4. However, their new-found success was short-lived and their fifth studio album, Don't <b>Mind</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> Do, released in 1999, peaked at No.64 in the UK. It included minor UK hits in [...] "Your Kisses Are Charity" [...] (UK No.25) and [...] "Cold Shoulder" [...] (UK No.43).|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Trailer Choir {{issued its}} second single, [...] "What Would You Say." [...] This became the group's first chart entry, peaking at No.43 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts in May 2009. On June 9, 2009, the group {{released}} a physical extended play entitled Off the Hillbilly Hook, which included all four {{songs from the}} digital EP and two more songs. After its release came the trio's third single, [...] "Rockin' the Beer Gut", which became the group's first Top 40 hit on the country charts in mid-2009. The song's music video features Wolf from American Gladiators. In December 2009, [...] "Rockin' the Beer Gut" [...] re-entered the charts following a [...] "Holla Day Version" [...] released for the Christmas season. [...] "Rollin' Through the Sunshine" [...] charted at No.50 in early 2010, shortly before {{the release of the}} band's debut album, Tailgate. The band also appears on the track [...] "Don't <b>Mind</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> Don't" [...] from Trace Adkins's album Cowboy's Back In Town.|$|E

You would not let me do that. Why shouldn't I do as I like, and not mind? Other people do." [...] Poor Gwendolen's speech expressed nothing very clearly except her irritation.|$|R

2500|$|Fo and Rame {{collaborated on}} the {{monologue}} Settimo: ruba un po' meno no. 2 (...) , {{inspired by the}} corruption scandals (Tangentopoli) which were rife in Italy during the 1990s. They later performed Mamma! I sanculotti! (Mummy! The Sans-culottes!), set {{in the eighteenth century}} but also making references to the Tangentopoli, and featuring music again by Fiorenzo Carpi. For the 1994 monologue Sesso? Grazie, tanto per gradire! (Sex? Thanks, Don't <b>Mind</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> Do!), Fo and Rame worked with their Jacopo to produce a performance based on Jacopo's 1992 book Lo Zen e l'arte di scopare (Zen and the Art of Fucking), featuring educational pieces on topics such as AIDS, contraception, sex education and sexual repression. Thus came Fo's first run-in with the new government of Silvio Berlusconi. Berlusconi's government banned Italians under the age of 18 from seeing it over fears, it said, that the play could [...] "cause offence to the common decency which requires respect for spheres of decency, and provoke distress among adolescent spectators, with possible effects on their behaviour in relation to sex", thus defeating the original purpose of the performance. Much free publicity ensued, with the censorship issue being debated in the national parliament, teachers calling for it to be performed, and audiences and both Italian and foreign intellectuals signing a petition calling for the ban to be overturned.|$|E
