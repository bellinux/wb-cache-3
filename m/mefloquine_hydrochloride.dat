40|$|Transition metal {{complex of}} Co(II) with <b>Mefloquine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (antimalaria drug) was {{synthesized}} using template method. Chemical analysis including conductivity measurements and spectroscopic studies {{were used to}} propose the geometry and mode of binding of the ligand to metal ion. From analytical data, the stoichiometry of the complex {{has been found to}} be 1 : 1. Infrared spectral data also suggest that the ligand (<b>mefloquine</b> <b>hydrochloride)</b> behaves as a tridentate ligand with N:N:O donor sequence towards the metal ion. The complex generally showed octahedral coordinate geometry. Conductivity measurement of 10 - 2 mol dm- 3 methanol solution of the complex indicated non-electrolytic nature of metal complex. It also revealed that the ligand anions were covalently bonded to the complex. In-vivo evaluation of antimicrobial studies of the metal complex showed greater activities when compared to the free mefloquine. The complex was screened against malarial parasites (Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis) : It was evident from the results obtained that Co(II) mefloquine has highest clearance of about 80 % parasitaemia reduction compared to the free mefloquine. The ligand and metal complex were screened for their toxicological activities at the dose of 0. 60 mg/Kg body weight twice daily for seven days on the alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotranferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities of rat serum, liver and kidney.

30|$|<b>Mefloquine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> [dl-erythro-α-(- 2 -piperidyl)- 2, 8 -bis (trifluoromethyl)- 4 -quinolinemethanol], {{historically}} {{has been used}} as a prophylactic and treatment agent for malaria infection caused by Plasmodium falciparum (Nevin 2012 a; Magill 2006). Mefloquine was developed at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in the 1970 ’s and had been marketed under the trade name Lariam, among others (Nevin 2012 b). Due to its long half-life in the body (Yelmo et al. 2010), allowing for weekly rather than daily treatment, and its efficacy against chloroquine-resistant forms of the disease (Nevin 2012 b), mefloquine was employed widely among travelers to areas where malaria infection was likely (Nevin 2012 b; Petersen et al. 2000; van Riemsdijk et al. 1997, 2005; Phillips and Kass 1996) including members of the U.S. military deployed overseas to such areas as Iraq and Afghanistan (Nevin 2010; Peterson et al. 2011; Vuurman et al. 1996).|$|E
40|$|Mefloquine {{has proved}} {{effective}} in chloroquine- and quinine-resistant falciparum malaria, but it cannot be given parenterally. We have measured {{the absorption of}} <b>mefloquine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> suspension (mean 15. 6, range 9. 7 - 28. 6 mg/kg) given by nasogastric tube to 19 cerebral malaria patients already receiving intravenous quinine.

Steady state plasma concentrations over 7 days ranged from 300 to 1, 050 (mean 561) ng/g. Bioavailability of mefloquine suspension in cerebral malaria therefore appears to be adequate for treatment in all but the most severely ill patients. Although intragastric mefloquine cannot now be recommended as an alternative to intravenous quinine for the treatment of severe chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria, this situation could change if quinine resistance increases further...|$|E

It is shown that even small amounts of the drug affect the surface pressure-area isotherms as well as surface vibrational spectra of some lipid monolayers, which points to a significant interaction. the effects on the latter depend on the electrical charge of the monolayer-forming molecules, with the drug activity being particularly distinctive for negatively charged lipids. Therefore, the lipid composition of the monolayer modulates the interaction with the lipophilic drug, which may have important implications in understanding how the drug acts on specific sites of the protozoan membrane.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present investigation was to reduce the bitterness with improved dissolution, in acidic medium (pH  1. 2), of <b>mefloquine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (MFL). Microparticles were prepared by coacervation method using Eudragit E (EE) as polymer and sodium hydroxide as precipitant. A 32 full factorial design was used for optimization wherein the drug concentration (A) and polymer concentration (B) were selected as independent variables and the bitterness score, particle size and dissolution at various pH were selected as the dependent variables. The desirability function approach has been employed {{in order to find}} the best compromise between the different experimental responses. The model is further cross validated for bias. The optimized microparticles were characterized by FT-IR, DSC, XRPD and SEM. Bitterness score was evaluated by human gustatory sensation test. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the reduced bitterness of MFL can be obtained by controlling the dissolution of microparticles at pH  6. 8 and increasing the EE concentration. The increase in polymer concentration leads to reduction in dissolution of microparticles at pH[*]>[*] 5 due to its insolubility. However the dissolution studies at pH  1. 2 demonstrated enhanced dissolution of MFL from microparticles might be due to the high porosity of the microparticles, hydrophilic nature of the EE, and improved wettability, provided by the dissolved EE. The bitterness score of microparticles was decreased to zero compared to 3 + of pure ARM. In conclusion the bitterness of MFL was reduced with improved dissolution at acidic pH...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{emergence}} of drug resistance {{is one of}} the main problems concerning malaria treatment. The use of counterfeit and/or substandard antimalarial drugs can contribute to the development of parasite resistance. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of antimalarial drugs distributed in Brazil. METHODS: Samples containing chloroquine phosphate, <b>mefloquine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> primaquine phosphate, and quinine sulfate tablets were delivered to the Rio de Janeiro central storeroom (CENADI), state storerooms (SS), and Basic Health Units (BHUs) in the north region of Brazil - a total of 10 sample sets. After 5 months of storage, the samples were collected, and in vitro quality control analyses according to official and published methods were performed. RESULTS: Inadequate drug storage conditions were found in two SS and in all BHUs evaluated. There were no quality deviations found in the chloroquine samples. The quinine samples exhibited weight variation above the allowed limits. The primaquine samples were found to have packaging deficiency. The release of mefloquine in samples from some regions showed a statistically significant difference when compared with the CENADI samples. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to periodically evaluate the quality and storage conditions of essential drugs. The quality deviations found with the primaquine and quinine samples are not related to storage conditions and must be addressed urgently. The decreased mefloquine release from tablets is related to formulation problems or influenced by inadequate storage conditions, prompting further investigation. Even with the mentioned problems, the samples would probably not contribute to resistant parasite selection...|$|E

The animals were separated in three groups: 1) oral <b>mefloquine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> treatment (16 mg/kg/day/ 10 days), 2) intramuscular aminosidine (Paromomycin®) treatment (20 mg/kg/ 20 days) and 3) control. Twenty six mice of each treated group were sacrificed, one at the end of treatment (nine weeks after inoculation), and one six weeks later (fifteen weeks after inoculation). Control Group animals were sacrificed at weeks six, nine and fifteen after inoculation. There {{was no significant difference between}} Group 1 (mefloquine) and Group 3 (control) subjects. Group 2 animals (aminosidine) presented the smallest differences of all, both at the end of the treatment and six weeks later. The histopato-logical parameters have shown the following findings: a) there was no significant difference between the mefloquine treated group and the control group; the group treated with aminosidine showed fewer of vacuolated macrophages than the control group, at week 9 (end of treatment). b) both at the end of treatment and six weeks later, evaluation of tissue necrosis and tissue fibrosis revealed no differences between the treated groups. It was found that six weeks after the end of treatment, mice in the control group presented significantly more severe degrees of fibrosis than mice in the other groups. It can be concluded that mefloquine showed limited therapeutic effect in this experimental model, whereas aminosidine had a significant effect. Nevertheless, neither of them resulted in cure of the lesions...|$|E
40|$|The {{absolute}} configuration of (−) -mefloquine {{has been established}} as 11 R, 12 S by X-ray crystallography of the hydrochloride salt, thus allowing comparison of the configuration of mefloquine's optical isomers to those of quinine and quinidine. (−) -Mefloquine has the same stereochemistry as quinine, and (+) -mefloquine has the same stereochemistry as quinidine. Since (+) -mefloquine is more potent than (−) -mefloquine in vitro against the D 6 and W 2 strains of Plasmodium falciparum and quinidine is more potent than quinine, a common stereochemical component for antimalarial activity is implicated. The crystal of (−) -mefloquine hydrochloride contained four different conformations which mainly differ in a small rotation of the piperidine ring. These conformations are {{essentially the same as}} the crystalline conformations of racemic mefloquine methylsulfonate monohydrate, <b>mefloquine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> and mefloquine free base. The crystallographic parameters for (−) -mefloquine hydrochloride hydrate were as follows: C 17 H 17 F 6 N 2 O+Cl− · 0. 25 H 2 O; Mr, 419. 3; symmetry of unit cell, orthorhombic; space group, P 212121; parameters of unit cell, a = 12. 6890 ± 0. 0006 Å (1 Å = 0. 1 nm), b = 18. 9720 ± 0. 0009 Å, c = 32. 189 ± 0. 017 Å; volume of unit cell, 7, 749 ± 4 Å 3; number of molecules per unit cell, 16; calculated density, 1. 44 g cm− 3; source of radiation, Cu Kα (λ = 1. 54178 Å); μ (absorption coefficient), 2. 373 mm− 1; room temperature was used; final R 1 (residual index), 0. 0874 for 3, 692 reflections with intensities greater than 2 σ.

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of (+/-) -mefloquine methylsulfonate monohydrate {{was determined by}} X-ray diffraction and was compared with the {{crystal structure}}s of <b>mefloquine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and mefloquine free base. The conformation of mefloquine was essentially the same in all three crystalline environments and was not dependent on whether mefloquine was a salt or a free base. In mefloquine methylsulfonate monohydrate, the angle between the average plane of the quinoline ring and the average plane of the piperidine ring was 76. 9 degrees. The intramolecular aliphatic N- 13 [...] . O- 1 distance was 2. 730 +/- 0. 008 A (1 A = 0. 1 nm), which {{is close to the}} aliphatic N [...] . O distance found in the antimalarial cinchona alkaloids. The hydroxyl group formed a hydrogen bond with the water molecule, and the amine group formed hydrogen bonds with two different methylsulfonate ions. The crystallographic parameters for (+/-) -mefloquine methylsulfonate monohydrate were as follows: C 17 H 17 F 6 N 2 O(+). CH 3 SO 3 (-). H 2 O; Mr = 492. 4; symmetry of unit cell, monoclinic; space group, P 2 (1) /a; parameters of unit cell, a was 8. 678 +/- 0. 001 A, b was 28. 330 +/- 0. 003 A, c was 8. 804 +/- 0. 001 A, beta was 97. 50 +/- 0. 01 degrees; the volume of the unit cell was 2145. 9 A 3; the number of molecules per unit cell was 4; the calculated density was 1. 52 g cm(- 3); the source of radiation was Cu K alpha (lambda = 1. 54178 A); mu (absorption coefficient) was 20. 46 cm(- 1); F(000) (sum of atomic scattering factors at zero scattering angle) was 1, 016; room temperature was used; and the final R (residual index) was 6. 58 % for 1, 740 reflections with magnitude of Fo greater than 3 sigma (F). Since the mechanism of antimalarial action and the mechanism of mefloquine resistance may involve hydrogen bond formation between mefloquine and a cellular effector or transport proteins, the common conformation of mefloquine found in each crystalline environment may define the orientation in which mefloquine forms these potentially critical hydrogen bonds with cellular constituents...|$|E
40|$|A {{generic drug}} product (World Health Organization (WHO) terminology: multisource product) is usually marketed and {{manufactured}} after {{the expiry date}} of the innovator’s patent. Generic drugs are less expensive than the innovator products because generic manufacturers {{do not have to}} amortize the investment costs of research, development, marketing, and promotion. Multisource products must contain the same active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) as the original formulation and have to be shown to be interchangeable with the original formulation. Multisource products have to be shown bioequivalent to the innovator counterpart with respect to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Multisource products are therefore identical in dose, strength, route of administration, safety, efficacy, and intended use. Bioequivalence can be demonstrated by in vitro dissolution, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic or clinical studies. Since 2000, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows the approval of certain multisource products {{solely on the basis of}} in vitro studies, i. e. by waiving in vivo studies in humans (“Biowaiver”), based on the Biopharmaceutics Classification Scheme (BCS). The BCS characterizes APIs by their solubility and permeability in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The different BCS Classes I-IV (Class I: high solubility, high permeability; Class II: low solubility, high permeability; Class III: high solubility, low permeability and Class IV: low solubility, low permeability) result from all possible combinations of high and low solubility with high and low permeability. Since the adoption of the BCS by the FDA in 1995, the BCS criteria have been under continuous development. In 2006, the WHO has released the most recent bioequivalence guidance including relaxed criteria for bioequivalence studies based on modified BCS criteria. According to this guidance, APIs belonging to the BCS classes I – and under defined conditions - II and III – are eligible for a biowaiver-based approval. The principal objective of this work was to characterize the first-line anti tuberculosis APIs, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol dihydrochloride and rifampicin, according to their physicochemical, biopharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacological properties and to classify them according to the BCS. Ethambutol dihydrochloride and isoniazid were classified as borderline BCS class I/III APIs. Pyrazinamide was classified as a BCS class III and rifampicin as a BCS class II API. Based on the BCS classification and the additional criteria defined in the WHO bioequivalence guidance, the possibility of biowaiver-based approval for immediate release (immediate release) solid oral dosage forms containing the first-line antituberculosis drugs was evaluated. A biowaiver-based approval with defined constraints was recommended for immediate release solid oral dosage forms containing isoniazid (interaction with reducing sugars), pyrazinamide and ethambutol dihydrochloride (relative narrow therapeutic index). Rifampicin was classified as a BCS class II API, and it was concluded that rifampicin containing solid oral immediate release drug products as well as Scale-Up and Post-Approval Changes (SUPAC) changes should not be approved by a biowaiver on the following basis: (i) its solubility and dissolution are highly variable due to polymorphism and instability, (ii) concomitant intake of food and antacids reduces its absorption and bioavailability, (iii) no in vitro predictive dissolution test has been found which correlates to in vivo absorption and (iv) several publications reporting cases of non-bioequivalent and bioinequivalent rifampicin products have been located in the literature. Thus, it is recommended that bioequivalence of rifampicin containing solid oral immediate release drug products should be established by in vivo pharmacokinetic studies in humans. This risk-benefit benefit assessment of a biowaiver-based approval was presented as a poster at the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS) 2005 and subsequently published as “Biowaiver Monographs” in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences. Based on the assessment of the dissolution properties of the antituberculosis drugs for a biowaiver approval, quality control dissolution methodologies for the International Pharmacopoeia (Pharm. Int.) were developed, presented at the WHO expert meeting and adopted in the Pharm. Int. ([URL] Additionally, preliminary biowaiver recommendations were also developed for four firstline antimalarial drugs listed on the WHO Essential Medicines List (EML) : Quinine, as both the hydrochloride and sulphate, and proguanil hydrochloride were classified as borderline BCS class I/III APIs. Since quinine is a narrow therapeutic index drug and many cases of non-bioequivalence have been reported in the literature, a biowaiverbased approval was not recommended. For solid oral immediate release dosage forms containing proguanil a biowaiver-based approval was recommended under the condition that they dissolve very rapidly. Primaquine phosphate was classified as a BCS class I API. Therefore, a biowaiver-based approval was recommended for immediate release solid oral dosage forms containing primaquine phosphate. <b>Mefloquine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> was classified as a basic, BCS class IV/II API, making it ineligible for the biowaiver. Additionally, reports of non-bioequivalence and a narrow therapeutic index were found in the scientific literature. Consequently, bioequivalence of solid oral immediate release dosage forms containing <b>mefloquine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> should be established by in vivo pharmacokinetic studies. The results for quinine hydrochloride and sulphate, proguanil hydrochloride, primaquine diphosphate and <b>mefloquine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> were presented as a poster at the Pharmaceutical Sciences World Congress (PSWC) 2007 and published as a WHO Collaborating Center Report in June 2006. The aim of this project was to collect, evaluate, generate and publish relevant information for a biowaiver-based approval of essential medicines in order to provide a summary to local regulatory authorities. This information complements the selected list of essential medicines by providing information about the biopharmaceutical properties and pharmaceutical quality of solid oral immediate release dosage forms containing these APIs. The aim of the biowaiver project, inspired by the WHO and brought in life by the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), is to enable access to essential medicines in standardized quality at an affordable price. In this work, a significant contribution to this aim in the form of four biowaiver monographs for the antituberculosis drugs and several reports on the antimalarials has been achieved. Nach Ablauf des Patentes der Erstzulassung eines Arzneistoffes (Originalpräparat) mit etablierter Wirksamkeit, Sicherheit und Qualität ist es erlaubt, Nachahmerpräparate (Generika) mit diesem Arzneistoff zuzulassen. Als Generikum bezeichnet man ein Arzneimittel, welches den gleichen Wirkstoff eines bereits auf dem Markt befindlichen Medikaments enthält. Von dem Originalpräparat kann sich das Generikum bezüglich der enthaltenen Hilfsstoffen und der Herstellungstechnologie unterscheiden, muss aber dem Originalpräparat in dessen beanspruchter/n Indikation(en) äquivalent sein. Üblicherweise werden Generika mittels einer bezugnehmenden Arzneimittelzulassung zugelassen. Dabei muss Bioäquivalenz zum Orginalpräparat gezeigt werden. Zwei Produkte bezeichnet man als bioäquivalent, wenn eine äquivalente Bioverfügbarkeit beider Präparate, welche den identischen Wirkstoff enthalten, mittels geeigneter Testmethoden nachgewiesen wurde. Derartige Testmethoden wurden in den Bioäquivalenzrichtlinien unter anderem der US-amerikanischen Behörde für Lebensmittel- und Arzneimittelsicherheit (FDA) 7, der Europäischen Arzneimittelagentur (EMEA) 8 und der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) 19 festgelegt. Diese Testmethoden können vergleichende pharmakokinetische, pharmakodynamische oder klinische Studien im Menschen sein. Dabei muss laut der Bioäquivalenzrichtlinie z.

Die Auswahl der Kenngrößen und das Studiendesign hängen unter anderem von der Indikation und der Darreichungsform des Arzneimittels ab.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 The aqueous {{solubility}} of {{an active}} pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is an important property that requires evaluation during early development and prior to formulation of the final product. With general, experimental, solubility testing of different APIs, the question always arises as to whether particle size had been determined beforehand or not. All available literature suggests that particle size, for pharmaceutical powders, does not significantly affect equilibrium solubility. The dissolution rate will differ according to different particle sizes, but the overall results should be identical after equilibrium is established. This study was therefore planned to investigate as to whether different particle size fractions of the same API, dissolving at different rates, would all reach solubility equilibrium within 24 hours. Also, APIs from different solubility classes were investigated, because poorly soluble substances would most likely require {{a longer period of}} time to equilibrate. The time period of 24 hours was selected, because many published solubility studies report using that interval and is it the standard for our research group also. Available APIs were selected to determine the influence (if any) of particle size on their equilibrium solubilities and the time required for attaining that status. For the purpose of this investigation, five APIs were selected from compounds at our disposal in-house, ranging from freely soluble to poorly soluble in the order: chloroquine phosphate > pyrazinamide > <b>mefloquine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> > closantel sodium > roxithromycin. Solubility studies were successfully completed on four of the five APIs selected. For closantel sodium, pyrazinamide and roxithromycin it was demonstrated that the 24 hour test period was sufficient for the attainment of equilibrium solubility, regardless of the particle size fractions tested. Surprisingly, the only API in this study for which 24 hours was an insufficient test period was mefloquine HCl, which was not the least soluble compound tested. Further testing would be required to clarify this anomaly. What was evident from the outcomes of this investigation was that although the ubiquitous 24 hour solubility test may work well in many cases, its suitability should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and not just for the most poorly soluble compounds. Researchers testing solubility at temperatures lower than 37 °C should be especially cautious of using a standardised test period, because equilibrium solubility would take longer to achieve with less energy available to the system.

40|$|<b>Mefloquine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> is an {{antimalarial}} {{agent that}} has been used for the past 40 years. Numerous reports of neurological side effects have recently led the FDA to issue a strong warning regarding long-term neurological effects. This warning lead to the U. S. Army’s Special Forces and other components to discontinue its use in July of 2013. Despite reported adverse side effects, mefloquine remains in circulation and is recommended to travelers going to specific Asian countries. Mefloquine {{has been used as a}} treatment for those already infected with the malaria parasite (blood concentrations ranging from 2. 1 to 23 µM), and as prophylaxis (blood concentrations averaging 3. 8 µM) (Dow 2003). The purpose of this study was to quantify Mefloquine’s toxicity using spontaneously active nerve cell networks growing on microelectrode arrays in vitro and to identify compounds that alleviate or reduce toxic effects. The current literature on mefloquine toxicity is lacking electrophysiological data. These data will contribute to research on the mechanism of adverse side effects associated with mefloquine use. Sequential titration experiments were performed by adding increasing concentrations of mefloquine solution to cultured neurons. Network responses were quantified and reversibility was examined. In each network, activity decreases were normalized as a percent of reference activity yielding a mean IC 50 value of 5. 97 ± 0. 44 (SD) µM (n= 6). After total activity loss, no activity was recovered with two successive medium changes. To test for network response desensitization resulting from sequential applications over 5 - 6 hr periods, one-point titrations at varying concentrations were conducted with fresh networks. These experiments yielded a single concentration response curve with an IC 50 value of 2. 97 µM. This represents a statistically significant shift (p < 0. 0001) to lower concentrations of mefloquine, demonstrating that sequential applications result in network desensitization. After mefloquine exposures, cells were evaluated for irreversible cytotoxic damage. Over a 12 -hour period under 6 µM mefloquine, process beading and granulation of somal cytoplasm were observed. At 8 µM mefloquine cell stress was apparent after only 10 minutes with major glial damage and process beading at 120 minutes. In this study, quinolinic acid served as a neuroprotectant at 20 µM. There have been multiple studies on the endogenous concentrations of quinolinic acid and current literature is quite variable. Immunocompromised individuals have some of the highest blood levels of quinolinic acid (up to 20 µM). With 30 min pre-applications of quinolinic acid, the mefloquine IC 50 value shifted from 5. 97 ± 0. 44 µM (n= 6), to 9. 28 ± 0. 55 µM (n= 3). This represents a statistically significant change to higher mefloquine concentrations and demonstrates neuroprotection...|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} eighty-two male inbred C 57 /BL/ 6 mice were {{infected}} with 3 x 106 Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis promastigotes of the MHOM/BR/PH 8 strain {{by means of}} a subcutaneous injection in the right ear. The animals were separated in three groups: 1) oral <b>mefloquine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> treatment (16 mg/kg/day/ 10 days), 2) intramuscular aminosidine (Paromomycin®) treatment (20 mg/kg/ 20 days) and 3) control. Twenty six mice of each treated group were sacrificed, one at the end of treatment (nine weeks after inoculation), and one six weeks later (fifteen weeks after inoculation). Control Group animals were sacrificed at weeks six, nine and fifteen after inoculation. There {{was no significant difference between}} Group 1 (mefloquine) and Group 3 (control) subjects. Group 2 animals (aminosidine) presented the smallest differences of all, both at the end of the treatment and six weeks later. The histopato-logical parameters have shown the following findings: a) there was no significant difference between the mefloquine treated group and the control group; the group treated with aminosidine showed fewer of vacuolated macrophages than the control group, at week 9 (end of treatment). b) both at the end of treatment and six weeks later, evaluation of tissue necrosis and tissue fibrosis revealed no differences between the treated groups. It was found that six weeks after the end of treatment, mice in the control group presented significantly more severe degrees of fibrosis than mice in the other groups. It can be concluded that mefloquine showed limited therapeutic effect in this experimental model, whereas aminosidine had a significant effect. Nevertheless, neither of them resulted in cure of the lesions. Foram utilizados 182 camundongos machos, isogênicos, da linhagem C 57 BL/ 6 inoculados na orelha direita com 3, 0 x 10 (6) formas promastigotas da cepa MHOM/BR/PH 8 de Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis. Os animais foram separados em três grupos: 1) 52 animais tratados com mefloquina (16 mg/kg/dia/ 10 dias), 2) 52 animais tratados com aminosidina [Paramomicina ®] (20 mg/kg/dia/ 20 dias), 3) 78 animais controles, não manipulados. Vinte e seis animais de cada grupo tratado foram sacrificados nove e quinze semanas após a inoculação. Animais do grupo controle foram sacrificados na sexta, nona e décima quinta semanas após a inoculação. Ao final do tratamento, em relação à curva de peso da orelhas, somente nos animais tratados com aminosidina, houve nítida redução do peso em comparação com grupo controle. Na histopatologia verificou-se: a) não houve diferença entre o grupo tratado com mefloquina e o grupo controle; o grupo tratado com aminosidina, ao final do tratamento, teve menor infiltração por macrófagos vacuolizados; b) as avaliações da extensão das áreas de necrose e do nível da fibrose tecidual não mostraram diferenças entre os grupos tratados. Os animais do grupo controle apresentaram fibrose mais acentuada, seis semanas após o fim do tratamento. Pode-se concluir que ocorreu efeito terapêutico reduzido com a mefloquina e houve significativa melhora com a aminosidina. Entretanto, em todos os grupos as lesões não chegaram a curar...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Stability {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the development of a new drug product. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is considered a stability indicating method of analysis. It is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry for the quantification of small organic molecules during stability testing. Previous stability studies conducted on Pheroid™-based drug products, experienced problems with the generation of reliable data by means of HPLC analysis. With these studies it was concluded that the inconclusive results could either be attributed to the stability of the delivery system itself and the compatibility of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API's) with the delivery system, or to the usage of unsuitable HPLC methods. The aims of this study were to: i. determine if the Pheroid™ delivery system changes significantly over time at accelerated storage conditions and how these changes influence the HPLC analysis, ii. determine the effect of the anti-oxidant tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) on the stability and HPLC analysis of the Pheroid™ delivery system, and iii. to suggest a suitable approach for the analysis of Pheroid™-based drug products. Pheroid™ microsponges, containing no API's, were prepared and stored for a period of three months at 5 °C, 25 °C+ 60 %RH, 30 °C+ 65 %RH and 40 °C+ 75 %RH. Two of the four Pheroid™ formulations contained an extra anti-oxidant, namely TBHQ. Monthly HPLC analyses were done using existing methods for mefloquine and artesunate. In addition to HPLC analysis, particle size analysis and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) were undertaken to support the HPLC results and provide information concerning the overall stability of the Pheroid™ delivery system. After the completion of the above analyses, experiments were carried out to determine whether adjustments to some of the key chromatographic parameters could improve the separation of Pheroid™-based samples. The parameters that were subjected to change included the organic solvent, isocratic versus gradient separation, pH and detection wavelength. Two pro-Pheroid vesicles formulations were prepared and stored for a three month period at 40 °C+ 75 %RH only. No API was added to the one formulation while the other contained 2 mg/ml of <b>mefloquine</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> Results obtained indicated that the Pheroid™ formulations changed after exposure to elevated temperature and humidity. The number of detectable peaks increased, longer run times became necessary and solubility in the sample solvent (methanol) decreased. Solubility of the Pheroid™ formulations in methanol was preserved to some extent by the presence of TBHQ. Physical signs of instability like discolouration and creaming were noted for TBHQ-containing formulations. TBHQ also seemed to have influenced the particle sizes, particle size distributions and structure of the Pheroid™ microsponges. With adjustments made to the HPLC method it was found that: i. the sample solvent is incompatible with the HPLC system, ii. very hydrophobic compounds are present in the Pheroid™-based samples, iii. acetontrile and methanol are unsuitable for both gradient and isocratic separation of Pheroid™-based samples, iv. more Pheroid™ components absorb at shorter wavelengths, and v. small changes in the pH values usually implemented do not influence the retention and selectivity of the Pheroid™ components. The Pheroid™ delivery system proved to be too complex and reversed hydrophobic for phase HPLC analysis. Preparation of the sample by only diluting the Pheroid™ formulations with pure methanol was not optimal. These samples introduced compounds to the column of which some caused interferences with the analyte peak while others were difficult to elute from the column. To continue using HPLC for the analysis of Pheroid™-based drug products, it is therefore recommended that attention should be given to the development of a more appropriate sample preparation procedure, like solid phase extraction or liquid-liquid extraction, one that will eliminate the effects of the Pheroid™ components. Physical instabilities noticed with the addition of TBHQ, suggest that there should also be attended to the compatibility and stability of each of the components in the Pheroid™ delivery system during formulation development.
