The basic theoretical tools employed are Green's function for elliptic problems and the eigendecomposition of symmetric positive definite matrices. Based upon this study, a general strategy is suggested for how to choose the <b>monitor</b> <b>function,</b> and numerical results are presented for illustrative purposes. The three dimensional case is also briefly discussed. It is noted that the strategy used here can be applied to other elliptic mesh generation techniques as well.

We illustrate the main ideas by considering elliptic obstacle problems. Some important issues {{such as how to}} derive the sharp estimators and how to smooth the <b>monitor</b> <b>functions</b> are addressed. The numerical schemes are applied to a number of test problems in two dimensions. It is shown that the moving mesh methods with the proposed <b>monitor</b> <b>functions</b> can effectively capture the free boundaries of the elliptic obstacle problems and reduce the numerical errors arising from the free boundaries.

The central difference scheme is used to discretize the problem on adaptively generated mesh where the mesh equation is derived using an equidistribution principle. An a priori <b>monitor</b> <b>function</b> is obtained from the error estimate. A suitable a posteriori analogue of this <b>monitor</b> <b>function</b> is also derived for the mesh construction which will lead to an optimal second-order parameter uniform convergence. We present the results of numerical experiments for linear and semilinear reaction-diffusion systems to support the effectiveness of our preferred <b>monitor</b> <b>function</b> obtained from theoretical analysis.

40|$|Adaptive moving mesh {{research}} usually focuses {{either on}} analytical derivations for prescribed solutions or on pragmatic solvers with challenging physical applications. In the latter case, the <b>monitor</b> <b>functions</b> that steer mesh adaptation are often defined in an ad-hoc way. In this paper we generalize our previously used <b>monitor</b> <b>function</b> {{to a balanced}} sum of any number of monitor components. This avoids the trial-and-error parameter fine-tuning that is often used in <b>monitor</b> <b>functions.</b> The key reason for the new balancing method is that the ratio between the maximum and average value of a monitor component should ideally be equal for all components. Vorticity as a monitor component is a good motivating example for this. Entropy also {{turns out to be}} a very informative monitor component. We incorporate the <b>monitor</b> <b>function</b> in an adaptive moving mesh higher-order finite volume solver with HLLC fluxes, which is suitable for nonlinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. When applied to compressible gas flow it produces very sharp results for shocks and other discontinuities. Moreover, it captures small instabilities (Richtmyer-Meshkov, Kelvin-Helmholtz).
