5|$|Historical {{observations}} of the carnivorous syndrome in plant species have been restricted to the more obvious examples of carnivory, such as the active trapping mechanisms of Drosera and Dionaea, though authors have often noted speculation about other species that <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> obviously carnivorous. In one of the earlier publications on carnivorous plants, Charles Darwin had suggested many plants that have developed adhesive glands, such as Erica tetralix, Mirabilis longifolia, Pelargonium zonale, Primula sinesis, and Saxifraga umbrosa, may indeed be carnivorous but {{little research has been}} done on them. Darwin himself only mentioned these species in passing and did not follow through with any investigation. Adding to the small but growing list, Francis Lloyd provided his own list of species suspected of carnivory in his 1942 book on carnivorous plants, though these species and their potential were only mentioned in the introduction. Later, in a 1981 review of the literature, Paul Simons rediscovered Italian journal articles from the early 1900s that identified several additional sticky species that digested insect prey. Simons was surprised to find these articles lacking in the literature cited sections of many modern books and articles on carnivorous plants, suggesting that academic research has treated Lloyd's 1942 book as the authoritative and comprehensive source on pre-1942 research on the carnivorous syndrome.|$|E

25|$|Various {{arguments}} {{in favor of}} God establish God as a useful or even necessary assumption. Contrastingly some atheists hold firmly to the belief that assuming the existence of God introduces unnecessary complexity (Schmitt 2005, e.g., the Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit). Taking a nuanced position, philosopher Del Ratzsch suggests that the application of the razor to God <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> simple, least of all when we are comparing that hypothesis with theories postulating multiple invisible universes.|$|E
25|$|One {{feature of}} a plant is its phyllotaxy. The {{arrangement}} of leaves on the plant body is such that the plant can maximally harvest light under the given constraints, and hence, one might expect the trait to be genetically robust. However, it <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so.</b> In maize, a mutation in only one gene called abphyl (abnormal phyllotaxy) was enough to change the phyllotaxy of the leaves. It implies that sometimes, mutational tweaking of a single locus on the genome is enough to generate diversity. The abphyl gene was later on shown to encode a cytokinin response regulator protein.|$|E
25|$|One {{would expect}} that all {{simplified}} characters would simultaneously also be z-variants or semantic variants with their traditional counterparts, but many are neither. It is easier to explain the strange case that semantic variants can be simultaneously both semantic variants and specialized variants when Unicode's definition is that specialized semantic variants have the same meaning only in certain contexts. Languages use them differently. A pair whose characters are 100% drop-in replacements for each other in Japanese <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> flexible in Chinese. Thus, any comprehensive merger of recommended codepoints would have to maintain some variants that differ only slightly in appearance even if the meaning is 100% {{the same for all}} contexts in one language, because in another language the two characters may not be 100% drop-in replacements.|$|E

25|$|Relevant is {{the fact}} that {{certainty}} is never absolute in practice (and not just because of David Hume's problem of induction). The equations of Newtonian mechanics can exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This {{is an example of the}} butterfly effect, which is one of the subjects of chaos theory. The idea is that something even as small as a butterfly could cause a chain reaction leading to a hurricane years later. Consequently, even a very small error in knowledge of initial conditions can result in arbitrarily large deviations from predicted behavior. Chaos theory thus explains why it may be practically impossible to predict real life, whether determinism is true or false. On the other hand, the issue <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> much about human abilities to predict or attain certainty as much as it is the nature of reality itself. For that, a closer, scientific look at nature is necessary.|$|E
25|$|Several animal phyla are {{recognized}} for {{their lack of}} bilateral symmetry, and {{are thought to have}} diverged from other animals early in evolution. Among these, the sponges (Porifera) were long thought to have diverged first, representing the oldest animal phylum. They lack the complex organization found in most other phyla. Their cells are differentiated, but in most cases not organized into distinct tissues. Sponges typically feed by drawing in water through pores. However, a series of phylogenomic studies from 2008–2015 have found support for Ctenophora, or comb jellies, as the basal lineage of animals. This result has been controversial, since it would imply that sponges <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> primitive, but may instead be secondarily simplified. Other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as the earliest-diverging animal phylum is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes.|$|E

As a result, [...] "Africa is an exception and therefore is the current focus of sentimentality about poverty". In this context he examines Gordon Brown's desire as prime minister to ensure that every child in Africa receive a primary education. Dalrymple questions {{whether there is a}} link between improving educational standards and increasing economic growth in the continent, and cites the experience of Tanzania under Julius Nyerere, Equatorial Guinea under Macias Nguema, and Sierra Leone's fate after a [...] "long history of historical effort and achievement" [...] as evidence that this <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so,</b> and argues that Africa's priority is access to markets. Dalrymple concludes that Brown's position is pure sentimental posturing and smacks of [...] "Singerian moral universalism", which is [...] "preposterous—psychologically, theoretically, and practically".|$|E

500|$|There {{are some}} {{commonly}} used analogies {{that do not}} use power conjugate pairs. [...] For sensors, correctly modelling energy flows <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> important. [...] Sensors often extract only tiny amounts of energy into the system. [...] Choosing variables that are convenient to measure, particularly ones that the sensor is sensing, may be more useful. [...] For instance, in the thermal resistance analogy, thernal resistance is considered analogous to electrical resistance, resulting in temperature difference and thermal power mapping to voltage and current respectively. [...] The power conjugate of temperature difference is not thermal power, but rather entropy flow rate, something that cannot be directly measured. [...] Another analogy of the same sort occurs in the magnetic domain. [...] This maps magnetic reluctance to electrical resistance, resulting in magnetic flux mapping to current instead of magnetic flux rate of change as required for compatible variables.|$|E
500|$|For Dunne, the Dooley {{pieces were}} a burden, {{but one that}} brought him fame and money, neither of which was enough to keep him at his desk once he gained the Whitney legacy. Before he died in 1936, Dunne knew that {{interest}} in the Dooley pieces was fading, and this saddened him. [...] Understanding that readers were having trouble with the Irish dialect, he experimented with translating the columns into ordinary English, but published none in that form. In 1938, The New Republic noted in an article, [...] "if you try quoting Mr. Dooley's brogue to the average listener you will be rewarded {{with a look of}} intense pain. But if you translate Mr. Dooley into ordinary English nearly everything precipitates out as pure wisdom." [...] Ellis, writing in 1941, argued, [...] "that the Dooley essays are journalism of the finest type few will dispute; that they are literature in the more permanent sense <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> clear. Were the American-Irish brogue of Mr. Dooley still a living and growing language there might be no doubt about it, but Mr. Dooley's language has become at least obsolescent, and that puts the future of the Dooley essay in serious question." [...] Ellis noted that attempts to imitate Dunne's success with other Irish-dialect columns failed, and suggested the brogue was not essential to the originals' [...] popularity, [...] "Dunne's essays lose nothing today when translated into ordinary English words".|$|E
500|$|... "Beauty Mark" [...] is an ode to Wainwright's mother, {{the title}} {{referring}} to the mole above her lip. The song {{is one of the}} few up-tempo tracks on the album and contains multiple keyboard overdubs by Brion. Chris Yurkiw of the Montreal Mirror considered the track to be the most moving love song on the album, with an [...] "overt and open-hearted" [...] reference to his homosexuality: [...] "I <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> manly, but still I know you love me." [...] Wainwright's Summer Stage performance of [...] "Beauty Mark" [...] appears on his 2005 DVD All I Want. In [...] "Barcelona", Wainwright recalls a love affair that took place in the city of the same name. The song is loosely about AIDS and contains the Italian language lyric [...] "Fuggi, regal fantasima", taken from Giuseppe Verdi's opera Macbeth. According to Wainwright, the line appears in a scene when [...] "Macbeth is going mad and sees the ghost, and in [...] mind the ghost was AIDS." [...] "Matinee Idol" [...] is about the rise and fall of an entertainment figure, inspired by the death of actor River Phoenix. According to Greenwald, the musical song has a [...] "1920s, cabaret musical feel". [...] "Damned Ladies" [...] is a slow ballad about the [...] "beloved yet doomed ladies of opera". Wainwright said the following of [...] "Damned Ladies", which contains references to nine opera heroines: [...] "In the song, I lament how these women are constantly dying brutal deaths, which I can see coming but cannot stop. It gets me every time." [...] Greenwald described [...] "Sally Ann" [...] as a 1920s love ballad of [...] "lost love and emotional regret". The melody in [...] "Imaginary Love", the album's closing track, contains sixth and major seventh chords.|$|E
