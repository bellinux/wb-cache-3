40|$|We {{compared}} {{the effects on}} plasma lipids of margarines containing either a trans fatty acid- (TFA) -free hard fraction achieved through interesterification (from primarily saturated fatty acids) or a partially hydrogenated hard fraction. Thirty-eight mildly hyperlipidemic subjects consumed a low-fat diet for 2 wk. They were then allocated to 2 groups and underwent 3 dietary interventions for 3 wk each in random order (diets contained 35 % of energy as fat with 20 % of energy as <b>margarines</b> <b>or</b> <b>butter)</b> : group 1 (n = 18), butter, canola oil blend with TFAs, and TFA-free canola oil blend: group 2 (n = 19), butter, polyunsaturated oil blend with TFAs, and TFA-free polyunsaturated oil blend. Plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations after consumption of all oil blends and after the low-fat diet were not significantly different, but were 11 - 15 % lower than after butter (P < 0. 001). Whereas the canola oil blends {{did not differ from}} each other in their effects on lipoprotein profiles, the TFA-free polyunsaturated oil blend resulted in a significant 6 % reduction (- 0. 25 mmol/L; 95 % CI: - 0. 08, - 0. 42) in total and LDL cholesterol compared with the blend containing TFAs (P = 0. 006). In the canola oil blend, 10 % TFAs and 6 % oleic acid were replaced by approximately 14 % saturated fatty acids plus a 2 % increase in linoleic acid. In the polyunsaturated oil blend, 10 % TFAs and 5 % linoleic acid were replaced by a 10 % increase in saturated fatty acids as well as 3 % and 1 % increases in oleic and linolenic acids, respectively. We conclude that, compared with butter, TFA-free margarines may be equal to or more effective than margarines containing TFAs in lowering LDL cholesterol. Manny Noakes and Peter M Clifto...|$|R

5000|$|The dough for klenäter is {{made from}} flour, egg yolks, sugar, and <b>margarine</b> <b>or</b> <b>butter.</b> The dough is rolled out and then cut into strips, in Iceland often with a special cutting wheel called a kleinujárn. (A pizza cutter can also be used.) The size may vary, but about 10 cm long is typical. The {{uncooked}} strips are covered {{with plastic wrap and}} left to rest for two hours in a cold place. They are then fried in oil or sometimes lard and the dough expands into shape. [...] Traditionally, Icelanders fried kleinur in sheep tallow, but today oil is typically used.|$|E
40|$|The {{negative}} {{health effects}} of trans fatty acids from hydrogenated fats on plasma lipid profile have been well documented. However, the mechanisms responsible for these changes remain to be elucidated. Hence the overall objective of the thesis {{was to examine the}} effect of consuming different forms of hydrogenated fats on cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism, specifically fractional and absolute synthesis rates of free (FSR-FC and ASR-FC) and esterified (FSR-CE, AER and ER) cholesterol, and the functioning of the ASP pathway. In addition, validation of the newer deuterium incorporation (DI) method for measurement of endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis against the cholesterol precursor assessment approach was also performed. Fourteen moderately hypercholesterolemic (LDL-C ≥ 130 mg. dl- 1) postmenopausal women (65 [...] 71 yrs) participated in this study. Subjects consumed, in random order, each of 6 diets for 5 week periods, separated by washout periods ranging from 2 to 4 weeks in duration. The experimental diets included a baseline (BL) diet (39 % kcal fat) and 5 reduced fat diets (30 % kcal) where 2 / 3 rd of the fat was either soybean oil (SO), low trans squeeze (SQM), medium trans tub (TM), high trans stick (SM) <b>margarines,</b> <b>or</b> <b>butter</b> (BT). Results obtained from the series of analyses performed demonstrate that: (i) the DI method and levels of some cholesterol precursors correspond as methods for the study of in vivo cholesterol biosynthesis in humans; (ii) elevations in endogenous cholesterol synthesis (FSR-FC and ASR-FC) are not responsible for the increase in circulating cholesterol levels seen after consumption of the high trans SM, and high SFA rich BT and BL diets; (iii) suppression of cholesterol esterification rates on the SM diet may account for the decreased HDL-C levels observed on this diet and finally; (iv) dysfunction of the ASP pathway, with lower ASP and higher FFA levels could be responsible for the higher secretion of hepatic B 100 particles.

5000|$|In Visayas and Mindanao, torta {{refers to}} a native porous sponge cake {{delicacy}} that resembles a large cupcake with butter, sugar, and/or cheese on top, traditionally served with [...] "tsokolate" [...] (a thick, hot drink made of ground roasted cacao seeds) for afternoon snack or merienda. Traditional recipes vary from family to family or from town to town, but the ingredients basically consist of flour, egg yolks, milk, fresh coconut sap as sweetener, lard as shortening, {{and a bit of}} salt. The mixture is poured into small tin trays lined with Japanese paper that are brushed with <b>margarine</b> <b>or</b> <b>butter</b> and then slow-baked in a stone oven heated with burning wood or coconut husks. It differs from the 'torta mamon', or 'mamon', which is a mini sponge cake made of white egg yolks and baked sweet using refined white cane sugar or puto mamon.|$|E
40|$|The {{firmness}} of oil-continuous food products, such as <b>margarine</b> <b>or</b> <b>butter,</b> {{is based}} on a network of small crystallites of triglycerides. Few alternative routes to structure food grade oils are known that are not explained in essence by fatty acid crystallisation behaviour. One exception is the mixture of ¿-oryzanol with ß-sitosterol, which forms helical ribbons appearing as tubules through self-assembly. Small-angle neutron scattering was applied to organogels and emulsion gels based on these plant sterol systems, to investigate the structure of the sitosterol + oryzanol tubules in more detail. Special attention was given to contrast variation studies by using various solvents in which the sterol mixture had previously been shown to form tubules. The present study shows that the wall of the tubule can be considered to consist of two layers, of which the outer layer is composed of the ferulic acid moieties in the oryzanol. Further refinements in the tubule model are desirable to move the current semi-quantitative analysis to a quantitative one...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relations between}} food and drinking habits, and estimated exogenous advanced glycation end products (AGE) intake, skin autofluorescence (AF) as a marker of AGE accumulation, and intima media thickness (IMT). IMT of the carotid artery and skin AF were measured in 147 elderly subjects at an increased cardiovascular risk. Food and drinking habits and cardiovascular risk factors were recorded. Intake of exogenously derived AGE was estimated from food diaries. Wine consumption was inversely related with skin AF and IMT of the common carotid artery. The intake of proteins was independently or negatively related to skin AF Higher skin AF {{was found in the}} group that used predominantly <b>margarine</b> <b>or</b> <b>butter.</b> A positive relation was found between unsaturated fat intake and the mean IMT of the carotid bulb.

40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} the social demographic profile, nutritional status, {{the presence of}} non-transmissible chronic diseases and food intake of the community health agents (ACS) who belong to five family health units in the east zone of Sao Paulo City. Methods: It was a descriptive, exploratory and quantitative study conducted with 88 subjects. Data about their social demographic situation, anthropometric parameters (weight, height plus waist circumference), information {{about the presence of}} non-transmissible chronic diseases and food intake were collected. Results: The sample was mainly female 83 (94. 3 %), with age varying from 20 to 55 years old. Most were from the southeastern region 72 (81. 2 %), having high school degree 71 (80. 7 %) with a family income between 2 and 5 minimum wages 62 (70. 4 %). The anthropometric evaluation revealed that 46 (52. 3 %) were eutrophic; 41 (46. 6 %) were overweight and 41 (46. 6 %) presented high risk or very high risk for cardiovascular diseases, although 77 (87. 5 %) did not refer any non-transmissible chronic disease. Regarding to food intake, we found a daily intake of rice, bean, bread and <b>margarine</b> <b>or</b> <b>butter</b> and lowintake of milk and diary products, vegetables and greens. Bovine and chicken meats were the most consumed. Coffee showed to be the most consumed beverage followed by artificial juices. Fried and sweets were consumed weekly by 34. 9 % and 53. 4 % of the ACS, respectively. Conclusion: The overweight and abdominal obesity were the ACS’s main health problems, being both directly related to their inadequate feeding practices; which were also related totheir social demographic characteristics.

50|$|The type of roll-in fat used is {{typically}} <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> <b>margarine.</b> <b>Butter</b> and margarine are both water-in-oil emulsions, composed of stabilized water droplets dispersed in oil. While butter is appealing {{due to its}} high consumer acceptance, its low melting point, 32 °C, actually makes it undesirable for production purposes. The use of butter as roll-in fat during the lamination step will cause problems of oiling out during sheeting and fermentation if temperature is not tightly controlled, thus disrupting {{the integrity of the}} layers. On the other hand, margarines are commonly used as roll-in fat because they facilitate dough handling. Generally, roll-in margarine should have a melting point between 40 °C and 44 °C, at least 3 °C higher than the fermentation temperature to prevent oiling out prior to baking. It is also important to consider the plasticity and firmness of the roll-in fat, which is largely determined by its solid fat content. Generally, a greater proportion of solid fat coincides with larger croissant lift. At the same time, the roll-in fat should have plasticity comparable to that of the dough, such that the fat layers do not break during sheeting and folding. If the fat is firmer than the dough, then the dough can rupture. If the fat is softer than the dough, then it will succumb to the mechanical stress of sheeting and potentially migrate into the dough.|$|R
