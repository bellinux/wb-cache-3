2500|$|Words {{that can}} be spelled either way in British English include encyclopaedia, homoeopathy, chamaeleon, mediaeval (a <b>minor</b> <b>variant</b> in both AmE and BrE), foetid and foetus. The spellings foetus and foetal are Britishisms based on a mistaken etymology. The {{etymologically}} correct original spelling fetus reflects the Latin original and is the standard spelling in medical journals worldwide, the Oxford English Dictionary notes that [...] "In Latin manuscripts both fētus and foetus are used".|$|E

2500|$|Many {{words that}} are written with ae/æ or oe/œ in British English are written with just an e in American English.

Examples (with non-American letter in bold): aeon, anaemia, anaesthesia, caecum, caesium, coeliac, diarrhoea, encyclopaedia, faeces, foetal, gynaecology, haemoglobin, haemophilia, leukaemia, oesophagus, oestrogen, orthopaedic, palaeontology, paediatric. Oenology is acceptable in American English but is deemed a <b>minor</b> <b>variant</b> of enology, whereas although archeology and ameba exist in American English, the British versions archaeology and amoeba are more common. The chemical haem (named as a shortening of haemoglobin) is spelled heme in American English, to avoid confusion with hem.|$|E

50|$|The FV432 {{has been}} {{produced}} in three major variants, the Mark 1 (with a Mark 1/1 <b>minor</b> <b>variant)</b> with petrol engines, the Mark 2 with a Rolls-Royce K60 multi-fuel engine and the Mark 3 with a diesel engine. The Mark 2 <b>minor</b> <b>variant,</b> the 2/1, has its NBC pack {{flush with the}} hull side. An uparmoured variant, for use in Iraq and Afghanistan, of the Mark 3 was known as Bulldog. This name {{now appears to be}} extended to all Mark 3 versions of the FV432.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the level of}} antigenic conservation amongst the haemagglutinins (HAs) of H 1 swine influenza viruses, recently isolated from a wide geographical area, in haemagglutination inhibition assays against a panel of four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). We found {{a high degree of}} conservation with a dominant variant (52 of 54 isolates) that reacted with all MAbs. Only two <b>minor</b> <b>variants,</b> each failing to react with one MAb, were found. Using a one-step PCR technique followed by direct sequencing of the products, we {{examined the}} HA 1 region of the HA RNA of two representative dominant variants. We found no amino acid substitutions relative to a reference strain. The sequences of the HA 1 RNA of the two <b>minor</b> <b>variants</b> isolated here and of two other <b>minor</b> <b>variants</b> defined previously were also determined. Each contained inferred amino acid substitutions, all located at different positions on the HA. Finally, we sequenced HA 1 RNA obtained from the original pig lung suspensions from which the two dominant and two <b>minor</b> <b>variants</b> had been isolated. Three of the parent viruses were identical to their progeny in eggs whereas the fourth parent virus contained four amino acid differences from its progeny...|$|R
