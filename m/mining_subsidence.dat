5|$|<b>Mining</b> <b>subsidence</b> {{coupled with}} {{structural}} and political {{changes to the}} mining industry began the decline in Astley's industrial activities during the mid-20th century; its cotton mill closed in 1955, and the last coal {{was brought to the}} surface in 1970. However, Astley has grown as part of a commuter belt, supported by its proximity to Manchester city centre and inter-city transport links. Astley Green Colliery Museum houses collections of Astley's industrial heritage.|$|E
5|$|The {{manor house}} of Westleigh was at Higher Hall and existed in Richard I's time (1189–1199). In 1292 Sigreda, the heiress of the manor, married Richard de Urmston, and the manor {{passed to the}} Urmston family and {{remained}} there until {{the last of the}} male Urmstons died in 1659. It was later abandoned because of <b>mining</b> <b>subsidence</b> and Westleigh Old Hall became the manor by repute. The Ranicars and the Marsh families lived here. Westleigh Old Hall was another Leigh hall that had a moat.|$|E
5|$|R.H. Brandling of Middleton Lodge gave land on Town Street {{on which}} to build a church and parsonage in 1845. St Mary's Church was built in 1846 to designs by R. D. Chantrell, who also {{designed}} Leeds Parish Church. The church and its lych gate are designated Grade II listed buildings. The church originally had a tall spire which was taken down because of <b>mining</b> <b>subsidence</b> in 1939. There is a tradition that local miners gave either a week's wages or a week's work towards the cost of its construction.|$|E

5|$|By 1795, the {{original}} Bridgewater Canal from Worsley to Manchester had proved an economic success, prompting its owner, Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, to seek powers to extend it route to Leigh via Astley. The Duke's plans were approved, despite {{opposition from the}} local population. Canal traffic brought trade to Astley Green where the Hope and Anchor Inn (now the Boathouse) was built with stabling for horses that pulled the barges. The original canal bridge built to connect Lower and Higher Green lasted until 1904, when it was replaced. The second bridge was replaced in 1920 by an iron bridge, which could be raised to counter the effects of <b>mining</b> <b>subsidence.</b> A boatyard was established by Lingards Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In about 1891–92 the Church of St James the Great, Haydock, was built. This was {{constructed}} in half-timber to give protection against possible <b>mining</b> <b>subsidence.</b> Other new churches built during this partnership were St Wenefrede's Church, Bickley (1892), St David's Welsh Church in Rhosllannerchrugog, Denbighshire, All Saints Church, Higher Kinnerton (1893), the Congregational Church in Great Crosby (1897–98), and St John the Evangelist's Church, Weston, Runcorn (1897–1900). A spire was added to St Peter's Church, Chester in 1886–87 and a tower was added to Holy Trinity Church, Capenhurst in about 1889–90. In 1886–87 Douglas added a bell tower to St John the Baptist's Church, Chester and {{this was followed by}} the rebuilding of its north aisle. Other restorations, embellishments, and additions of monuments and furniture were carried out in churches during this partnership.|$|E

40|$|An {{association}} can {{be described}} as an organized body of individuals who have some interest, activity, or purpose in common. The role of an association in the legislative process is very important. One way to illustrate how important an association is to the legislative process is to show the effect it has on a certain piece of legislation. The vehicle used to show this importance is House Enrolled Act 1104, a bill passed by the 1992 Indiana General Assembly on <b>mine</b> <b>subsidence.</b> The paper is divided into four distinct sections. The first section introduces <b>mine</b> <b>subsidence,</b> describes the federal legislation, describes the state legislation, and informs the reader off the need for new legislation concerning <b>mine</b> <b>subsidence.</b> The second section introduces the major players and explains who they are, what they wanted from the legislation, and what they contributed to the legislation. The third section follows House Enrolled Act 1104 through the legislative process. The last section summarizes the changes to the <b>mine</b> <b>subsidence</b> statute and describes some observations of the author. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R

40|$|Changes in {{surface and}} {{groundwater}} hydrology induced by <b>mine</b> <b>subsidence</b> near surface fracturing can also subtly alter the geochemistry. More rapid {{drainage of surface}} and groundwater along fracture pathways may lower the standing water level allowing air to penetrate further, accelerating rock weathering and leaching reactions. However, these sulphide oxidation and carbonate dissolution reaction products are normal constituents of groundwater and their presence does not necessarily indicate an impact of <b>mine</b> <b>subsidence.</b> Changes to the groundwater recharge – discharge regime due to fracturing will also affect {{the age of the}} groundwater. Whilst the groundwater age is not a significant water quality parameter it may unambiguously distinguish changes to the hydrology, where conventional chemistry may be difficult to interpret. <b>Mine</b> <b>subsidence</b> fracturing may also cause hydraulic connection between previously isolated aquifers or ultimately between the surface and the mine. Isotopic geochemical dating (35 S, 3 H, 14 C) and tracing (13 C, 2 H, 18 O, 34 S) techniques are used to distinguish the origin of the groundwater and potential isolation or fracture connections. Isolated groundwater may show a dissolved gas signature similar to petroleum gas within the Bulgo Sandstone.

In 1962, the Thames–Clyde Express travelling via the S took almost nine hours from London to Glasgow – over the West Coast Main Line the journey length was 7 hours 20 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The Daw End Branch from Catshill Junction to {{limestone}} quarries and limeworks at Hay Head {{was also}} opened in 1800, some 5.4 miles (8.7 kilometres) long with no locks.

25|$|Numerous {{alterations}} {{to short}} {{sections of the}} original route have taken place, the most notable being {{the opening of the}} King Edward VII Bridge in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1906 and the Selby Diversion, built to bypass anticipated <b>mining</b> <b>subsidence</b> from the Selby coalfield and a bottleneck at Selby station. The Selby Diversion was opened in 1983 and diverged from the original ECML at Temple Hirst Junction, north of Doncaster, and joined the Leeds to York Line at Colton Junction south west of York.

40|$|At {{the end of}} the {{prosperity}} of the coal mining industry in Upper Silesia in Poland, new habitats were created in disturbed areas which, in the case of flooded <b>mine</b> <b>subsidence,</b> {{led to the formation of}} a type of ecological niche not encountered before.

In 2006 and 2007, the thrips fauna of subsidence areas was sampled in biotopes directly associated with depressions (waterside, contact zones between aquatic and terrestrial — forest biotopes). In both ecosystems a total of 118 plant species and 56 thrips species were found. Disturbance of land resulting in flooded <b>mine</b> <b>subsidence</b> contributes to increased species diversity of both plants and thrips.

25|$|On 22 January 1913 the new Dock was {{declared}} open by the Countess of Dalkeith; it had cost £750,000, {{and it was}} actually opened to shipping on 24 March 1913. Even then there was continual difficulty with {{the operation of the}} dock gates, probably due to <b>mining</b> <b>subsidence</b> under their supports. Attempts to rectify this problem dragged on, and the onset of World War I in 1914 overtook events, as the export coal trade collapsed during hostilities. In 1915 it was stated to be necessary to close the dock temporarily to rectify the problem with the gates, but the NBR directed instead that the closure should be semi-permanent, as the available business could now easily be handled at the nos 1 and 2 docks. This closure took place on 18 March 1915; the whole construction had been abortive.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, {{despite being}} a lifelong Conservative, Chelmsford was persuaded {{to join the}} Labour {{government}} of Ramsay MacDonald in 1924 as First Lord of the Admiralty, {{due to the fact}} that Labour had so few peers in the House of Lords. He never joined the party and only agreed on the condition that the Navy's size be maintained and that he not be expected to attend any cabinet meetings of a political nature. He was duly sworn in by King George V on 23 January 1924 at Buckingham Palace. He was appointed as a Commissioner exercising the office of Lord High Admiral three times on 1 April 15 August 1924 and 9 October 1924. Chelmsford was chairman of the Miners' Welfare Committee under the Mining Industry Act of 1920 and of the royal commission on <b>mining</b> <b>subsidence</b> in 1923–24. After the fall of the government in November 1924, he retired from political life.|$|E

30|$|Unlike {{conventional}} {{room and}} pillar underground coal <b>mining,</b> where <b>subsidence</b> {{is designed to be}} prevented, subsidence is a planned outcome of other methodologies. These include high extraction retreat, where the roof supporting pillars are systematically removed, and longwall mining, which employs a machine that mines a continuous strip of coal, thus leaving no roof supports. Both types result in the surface dropping ~ 70  % of the mined-out thickness. In Illinois there was a concern that farm land thus subsided would be lost to productive agriculture. Consequently, the possibility that planned <b>mine</b> <b>subsidence</b> would be banned in Illinois lead {{to the creation of the}} Illinois <b>Mine</b> <b>Subsidence</b> Research Program in 1985 to investigate agricultural impacts of planned <b>mine</b> <b>subsidence</b> and the possibility of mitigating its impact. Its findings established that subsidence was not as detrimental as feared and that the impacts could be mitigated. The project was a successful collaboration of state and federal governments and local Universities. Similarly, in Queensland, longwall mining is opposed by some in the farming community. In response, Bandanna Energy, the company planning the mining, organized the Agricultural Coexistence Research Committee to oversee research into the mitigation of longwall mining impacts. Although the soils, climate, and regulatory regimes are different, concerns of the local communities are similar.|$|R

25|$|Because the Caldon Canal was {{promoted}} and {{built by the}} proprietors of the Trent & Mersey Canal Company, as such it is more properly called the Caldon Branch of that canal. It was built to carry limestone from Caldon Low Quarries which was transported to Froghall wharf via three inclined Tramways. Other important traffic for the Canal was coal from the Cheadle Coalfield and Ironstone from the several iron ore mines in the Churnet valley and Kingsley area. The canal was subject to considerable <b>mining</b> <b>subsidence</b> in the Etruria area, which {{eventually led to the}} need for an entirely new lock, Planet Lock, with a rise of just three feet, to adjust the levels. Water to the canal is supplied by three reservoirs and the River Churnet. Stanley reservoir holds 22 million cubic feet (670 Megalitres (Ml)), and joins the canal just below Endon basin, while Knypersley holds 41 million cubic feet (1,200 Ml) and joins the canal above Engine Lock. The final section of its feeder was originally the Norton Green branch, a private canal built {{at the same time as}} the main line, to service a colliery. Rudyard reservoir holds 122 million cubic feet (3,500 Ml), and its feeder, which joins the Leek branch near the Churnet aqueduct, follows much of the proposed route of the Macclesfield Canal extension to Leek. Since the Caldon joins the summit level of the Trent and Mersey system, it is still a valuable supply for that canal too.|$|E
