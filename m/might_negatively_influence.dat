40|$|In a {{previous}} study, {{we found that}} relearning of a task with one hand <b>might</b> <b>negatively</b> be <b>influenced</b> by previous, opposite hand training of the analogue task, Thut G., et al., Exp. Brain Res., 108 (1996) 321 - 327. Drawing of a figure with the right hand, following left hand training, was slower than right hand drawing of an unknown figure. These conditions were termed right hand transfer learning (rTL) and right hand original learning (rOL). The present study aimed to identify the cerebral areas associated with these influences by measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 16 right-handed, healthy subjects during rTL and rOL. Positron emission tomography and statistical parametric mapping were used. Compared with rOL, rTL was associated with increased rCBF in the left medial prefrontal cortex and the right prefrontal convexity. Individual rCBF changes in the area homotopic to the right prefrontal convexity furthermore correlated with individual changes in rTL performance. While the smallest rCBF increases were found in subjects with weakest slowing of rTL relative to rOL, highest rCBF increases were present when rTL slowing dominated. Comparisons between rTL and rOL, however, revealed on average no performance differences. Our data suggest that relearning after previous opposite hand training activates neural mechanisms within the prefrontal convexity which might have an inhibitory function but that inhibition {{does not have to}} be the net final behavioral result.

Methods: Clinical and basic science studies that report the use of stem cells in the elderly patients with OA, DDD, and tendinopathies were identified using a PubMed search. The studies published in English have been assessed, and the best and most recent evidence was included in the current study. Results: Evidence suggests that, although short-term results regarding the effects of stem cell therapy in degenerative orthopaedic pathologies can be promising, stem cell therapies do not appear to reverse age-related tissue degeneration. Causes of suboptimal outcomes can be attributed to the decrease in the therapeutic potential of aged stem cell populations and the regenerative capacity of these cells, which <b>might</b> be <b>negatively</b> <b>influenced</b> in an aged microenvironment within the degenerated tissues of elderly patients with OA, DDD, and tendinopathies. Conclusions: Clinical protocols guiding the use of stem cells in the elderly patient population are still under development, and high-level randomized controlled trials with long-term outcomes are lacking. Understanding the consequences of age-related changes in stem cell function and responsiveness of the in vivo microenvironment to stem cells is critical when designing cell-based therapies for elderly patients with degenerative orthopaedic pathologies...|$|R

Once the process window for the ordered growth of GaN NCs by PA-MBE was identified, the successful selective growth was driven by the morphology of the hole-patterned Ti mask. Surface roughness and cleaning, and adhesion of the Ti mask to the GaN substrate are the most critical aspects that <b>might</b> <b>negatively</b> <b>influence</b> the ordered growth. In this context, our results suggest that FIB and CL, where neither etching steps nor organic chemicals are introduced, are preferred techniques to fabricate high-quality and reproducible hole-patterned masks.

Although this paper focuses on GaN nanocolumns, these technological aspects can be extended to the selective growth of nanostructures of different material and geometries.|$|E

PP-KLD showed remarkable effective inhibition to contaminant strains of B. cereus, E. fecalis, P. stutzeri, as well as Stenotrophomonas sp. Furthermore, the effective inhibition was superior to the commercial bacteriocins of H- 3 and glycine. However, both PP-KLD and the commercial bacteriocins were not active against Staphylococcus species. This <b>might</b> have been <b>negatively</b> <b>influenced</b> by the high incubation temperatures promoting faster growth of Staphylococcus (Viedma et al. 2009), which corresponded with the antimicrobial substance PP- 174 produced by Lb. plantarum KJ- 174 showing low inhibitory efficiency in cream filling against aerobic mesophilic bacteria, when the incubation temperature was increased from 15 to 37  °C (Wongsuttichote and Nitisinprasert 2009).

This article reviews the captive management history of the Lion-tailed Macaque, identifies management patterns that <b>might</b> have <b>negatively</b> <b>influenced</b> the development of the programs, and proposes to use this analysis to initiate a new management perspective. In the North American captive Lion-tailed Macaque population under the Species Survival Plan (SSP), the strong reduction in population size and group sizes due to space problems might have contributed to a decrease in population viability. The population over two decades has declined from almost 300 to less than 100 individuals. In the European population under the European Endangered Species Program (EEP), population size was not limited and larger groups were advocated. The population grew slowly but steadily to a present size of more than 350 individuals over about 23 years. The effective population size has remained low in both SSP and EEP populations. A general conceptual framework that focuses on individuals and their phenotypes for in situ and ex situ conservation recently developed by field conservationists is briefly introduced. It is used to suggest improvements in the management of the Lion-tailed Macaque. It is concluded that the size and structure of a breeding population is to be decided so as to provide conditions and materials for successful reproduction rather than by the available zoo space only. For this, large groups and populations with representation of all age-sex classes are advocated. This would result in a further {{reduction in the number of}} species kept in zoos.

This study focused on three main themes: (1) gender differences in mathematics anxiety; (2) gender differences in mathematics achievement; (3) relationship of mathematics anxiety with mathematics achievement across gender. Data were collected in two phases. In the first phase, data were collected through an adapted (Cavanagh 2 ̆ 6 Sparrow, 2011), piloted and modified Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (MARS). MARS used a five-point Likert scale. The total sample size for the first phase was 309 students, that comprised males (n= 173) and females (n= 136). MARS indicated that students of both the genders exhibited almost equal overall mathematics anxiety with a slight difference which was not significant. Moreover, males showed a significantly high level of attitudinal anxiety as compared to females, whereas, female students showed a significantly high level of cognitive anxiety as compared to males. Data for mathematics achievement was collected through a Mathematics Achievement Test (MAT), which was developed from past four-year annual examination papers for science group of Board of the Intermediate and Secondary Education, Sukkur. There were 25 Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and 10 Constructed Response Questions (CRQs). MAT was conducted {{with a sample of}} 264 Grade 10 students in the same schools where MARS was conducted.
