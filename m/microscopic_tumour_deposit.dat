40|$|Background: To {{study the}} {{incidence}} of <b>microscopic</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>deposit</b> in the neck in patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and hence, the role of routine elective neck dissection during nasopharyngectomy. Methods: Retrospective review of the pathology report of the selective neck dissection specimens in patients with recurrent NPC and clinically N 0 status. Results: Between 2000 and 2012, 38 patients presented with recurrent NPC requiring maxillary swing nasopharyngectomy and free flap reconstruction. The initial T-classification of the tumour was T 1, 15. 8 %; T 2, 52. 6 %; and T 3, 31. 6 %, and the N-classification was N 0, 26. 3 %; N 1, 47. 4 %, N 2, 15. 8 %; and N 3, 10. 5 %. Concurrent chemoradiation was given in 57. 9 % of the subjects. All patients in the series had complete response after the initial treatment, and the mean time to develop local tumour recurrence was 22. 3 months. Among these patients, only 1 (2. 6 %) demonstrated microscopic tumour metastasis in 1 lymph node removed during selective neck dissection. Conclusions:Given the low incidence of microscopic tumour metastasis in patients with recurrent NPC and clinically N 0 status, routine elective neck dissection may not be indicated. Further large scale investigation is indicated to address the issue...|$|E
40|$|High-grade serous {{ovarian cancer}} (HGSC) {{disseminates}} early and extensively throughout the peritoneal space, causing multiple lesions {{that are a}} major clinical problem. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the cellular composition of peritoneal <b>tumour</b> <b>deposits</b> in patient biopsies and their evolution in mouse models using immunohistochemistry, intravital microscopy, confocal microscopy, and 3 D modelling. <b>Tumour</b> <b>deposits</b> from the omentum of HGSC patients contained a prominent leukocyte infiltrate of CD 3 (+) T cells and CD 68 (+) macrophages, with occasional neutrophils. Alpha-smooth muscle actin(+) (α-SMA(+)) pericytes and/or fibroblasts surrounded these well-vascularized <b>tumour</b> <b>deposits.</b> Using the murine bowel mesentery as an accessible mouse peritoneal tissue that could be easily imaged, and two different transplantable models, we found multiple <b>microscopic</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>deposits</b> after i. p. injection of malignant cells. Attachment to the peritoneal surface was rapid (6 - 48 h) with an extensive CD 45 (+) leukocyte infiltrate visible by 48 h. This infiltrate persisted until end point and in the syngeneic murine ID 8 model, it primarily consisted of CD 3 (+) T lymphocytes and CD 68 (+) macrophages with α-SMA(+) cells also involved from the earliest stages. A majority of <b>tumour</b> <b>deposits</b> developed above existing mesenteric blood vessels, but in avascular spaces new blood vessels tracked towards the <b>tumour</b> <b>deposits</b> by 2 - 3 weeks in the IGROV- 1 xenografts and 6 weeks in the ID 8 syngeneic model; a vigorous convoluted blood supply was established by end point. Inhibition of tumour cell cytokine production by stable expression of shRNA to CXCR 4 in IGROV- 1 cells did not influence the attachment of cells to the mesentery but delayed neovascularization and reduced <b>tumour</b> <b>deposit</b> size. We conclude that the multiple peritoneal <b>tumour</b> <b>deposits</b> found in HGSC patients can be modelled in the mouse. The techniques described here may be useful for assessing treatments that target the disseminated stage of this disease...|$|R
40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} that <b>microscopic</b> <b>tumours</b> (of a transplantable murine mammary carcinoma, M 8013 X) grow faster than larger, palpable, <b>tumours.</b> <b>Microscopic</b> <b>tumours</b> {{are also more}} radiosensitive than larger tumours.

40|$|We could {{determine}} the S-phase fraction (SPF) by flow cytometric DNA analysis of paraffin archival material in 160 of 260 patients with soft-tissue sarcoma of extremity and trunk wall. The prognostic value of SPF was {{compared with other}} clinicopathological factors. The median follow-up time was 16 (6 - 31) years. In a univariate analysis, deep tumour location, increasing tumour size and histological malignancy grade, <b>microscopic</b> <b>tumour</b> necrosis, vascular invasion, DNA non-diploidy and high SPF (> 3. 0 %) were associated with poor metastasis-free survival. In a multivariate analysis, <b>microscopic</b> <b>tumour</b> necrosis and high SPF were independently prognostic for metastasis. Used in combination with <b>tumour</b> size, <b>microscopic</b> <b>tumour</b> necrosis and vascular invasion, SPF could identify a group of patients with a 5 -year metastasis-free survival rate of 0. 97.

THE METABOLIC CONDITIONS and cellkinetic characteristics of a tumour appear to change during its different growth phases. This has been suggested as having important repercussions on the effectiveness of anti-tumour agents such as ionizing radiation and hyperthermia.

30|$|Unilevel {{sectioning}} and staining is {{the most}} commonly used tool, but true lymph node metastasis – a fortiori, micrometastases (<b>tumour</b> <b>deposits</b> less than 2000  μm in size) and especially submicrometastases (<b>tumour</b> <b>deposits</b> less than 200  μm in size) – can escape the assessment [18]. Multilevel sectioning is the answer to the inadequacy of classical techniques. A good compromise is editing two or three adjacent vignettes at selected 200 -μm intervals, a distance that theoretically avoids missing even submicrometastases. Immunohistochemical staining increases the sensitivity of the assessment.|$|R

40|$|Summary. -Walker carcinosarcoma cells {{cause in}} vitro osteolysis {{which may be}} {{inhibited}} by aspirin.

PATIENTS with breast cancer frequently develop abnormalities in their calcium metabolism, which are usually associated with osteolytic bone metastases (Galasko and Burn, 1971) and are caused by excessive mobilization of calcium from the skeleton.

40|$|Breast-conserving therapy, {{involving}} breast-conserving surgery {{followed by}} whole-breast irradiation and optionally {{a boost to}} the tumour bed, is a standard therapeutic option for women with early-stage breast cancer. A boost to the tumour bed means that an extra dose of radiation is applied that covers the initial tumour site. The rationale for a boost of radiotherapy to the tumour bed is that (i) local recurrence occurs mostly {{at the site of}} the primary <b>tumour</b> because remaining <b>microscopic</b> <b>tumour</b> cells are most likely situated there; and (ii) radiation can eliminate these causative <b>microscopic</b> <b>tumour</b> cells. The boost continues to be used in women at high risk of local recurrence, but is less widely accepted for women at lower risk. Reasons for questioning the boost are twofold. Firstly, the boost brings higher treatment costs. Secondly, the potential adverse events are not negligible.

40|$|The factors {{affecting}} long-term survival following oesophagectomy for oesophageal cancer are poorly understood. We examined {{the significance of}} <b>microscopic</b> <b>tumour</b> involvement at the circumferential resection margin (CRM) on postoperative survival following oesophagectomy. The case notes of 329 patients who underwent a potentially curative oesophagectomy for squamous or adenocarcinoma were reviewed retrospectively. As part of the procedure, all patients underwent an en-bloc resection of their periesophageal tissue. The presence of tumour either at, or within, 1 mm of the CRM was recorded and correlated with their TNM and survival data. A total of 67 patients (20 %) were noted {{to have a positive}} CRM, of which 40 cases (12 %) had tumour at the resection margin and the remainder had tumour within 1 mm of the margin. Univariate analysis showed no statistically significant association between survival and either category of CRM involvement. Multivariate analysis showed that only T-stage, nodal status and tumour grade were prognostic markers.

However, it has not been completely elucidated which activity is mainly involved in the tumour suppression in vivo. In this study, we analysed inhibitory mechanisms of endogenous IFN-γ against B 16 melanoma experimental metastasis.

Detailed studies of the geographical distribution of this tumour have been made by Burkitt and O'Conor (1961) and of the histopathology and cytology by O'Conor (1961).

The cell line expressed both the 72 and 92 kDa forms of gelatinase by zymography. Batimastat administered from day 0 (40 mg kg- 1) reduced the volume of ascites to 21 % of control in mice treated from day 0 (P < 0. 002) but not day 10.

40|$|Tumour {{heterogeneity}} {{is central}} to chemotherapy resistance and disease progression in advanced malignancy. This heterogeneity arises due {{to the evolution of}} clones within the tumour cell population; the advent of high throughput sequencing has allowed the detection of different tumour cell clones within and between primary tumours and their metastases, potentially allowing mapping of tumour evolution. Several, automated bioinformatic approaches have been devised for determining tumour phylogeny from changes in genomic copy number (CN); either by the overall similarity of genomic changes between <b>tumour</b> <b>deposits</b> or by examining the occurrence of shared breakpoints. We have compared these automated approaches with a manual determination of phylogeny based upon shared breakpoints identified from four cases of metastatic colorectal cancer consisting of between 6 and 53 deposits. We illustrate several recurrent issues identified with the use of automated systems for the determination of tumour phylogeny associated with an inability to correctly identify and interpret changes in ploidy, an inability to identify heterogeneity within <b>tumour</b> <b>deposits,</b> the masking of smaller events by larger ones, over-interpretation of convergent, but unrelated events, over calling sequencing artefacts as changes in CN, and non-calling of genuine CN changes due to low tumour cell content or low sequencing depth.

40|$|The {{presence}} of immune infiltration of <b>tumour</b> <b>deposits</b> {{and the existence}} of effective in vitro anti-tumour immune responses would suggest the possibility of therapeutic manipulation against tumour cells. However, clinical immunotherapy has shown little promise as a cancer treatment. Numerous explanations for this inefficacy have been proposed, one of which involves the elaboration of immunosuppressive moieties from tumour cells. The results of studies presented below show that serum from patients with gastrointestinal and other tumours have immunosuppressive influences on normal lymphocytes. The degree of this in vitro inhibition is related to tumour 'bulk' and may reflect a systemic immunosuppressive influence of the tumour. Isolation and culture of lymphocytes from gastrointestinal <b>tumour</b> <b>deposits</b> demonstrated that these immune cells are functionally inert, suggesting the existence of an immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment. The isolation and partial purification of an immunosuppressive moiety from conditioned culture medium of a variety of human tumour cell lines further supports the hypothesis of tumour-mediated immunosuppression. A number of protein tumour cell products have been described with potent immunosuppressive properties. These include transforming growth factor-beta, interleukin- 10, and the retroviral envelope protein p 15 E. The surgical implications of the proposed tumour-host immune relationship includes the hypothesis that clinically apparent disease may not be amenable to immune attack owing to tumour-mediated immune suppression. The use of immunostimulatory strategies as adjuvant perioperative therapy would seem a more effective environment for the activation of antitumour immune responses in the surgical patient...|$|R
