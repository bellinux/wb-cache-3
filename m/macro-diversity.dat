50|$|In a {{cellular}} network or a wireless LAN, <b>macro-diversity</b> {{implies that the}} antennas are typically situated in different base station sites or access points. Receiver <b>macro-diversity</b> {{is a form of}} antenna combining, and requires an infrastructure that mediates the signals from the local antennas or receivers to a central receiver or decoder. Transmitter <b>macro-diversity</b> may be a form of simulcasting, where the same signal is sent from several nodes. If the signals are sent over the same physical channel (e.g. the channel frequency and the spreading sequence), the transmitters are said to form a single frequency network—a term used especially in the broadcasting world.|$|E
50|$|The aim is {{to combat}} fading and to {{increase}} the received signal strength and signal quality in exposed positions in between the base stations or access points. Macro diversity may also facilitate efficient broadcasting and multicasting services, where the same frequency channel {{can be used for}} all transmitters sending the same information. The diversity scheme may be based on transmitter (downlink) <b>macro-diversity</b> and/or receiver (uplink) <b>macro-diversity.</b>|$|E
50|$|Antenna {{diversity}}, {{also known}} as space diversity (micro-diversity as well as <b>macro-diversity,</b> i.e. soft handover, see below), is any one of several wireless diversity schemes that use two or more antennas {{to improve the quality}} and reliability of a wireless link.|$|E
50|$|CO-MIMO, {{also known}} as network MIMO (net-MIMO), or ad hoc MIMO, uses {{distributed}} antennas which belong to other users, while conventional MIMO, i.e., single-user MIMO, only employs antennas belonging to the local terminal. CO-MIMO improves {{the performance of a}} wireless network by introducing multiple antenna advantages, such as diversity, multiplexing and beamforming. If the main interest hinges on the diversity gain, it is known as cooperative diversity. It can be described as a form of <b>macro-diversity,</b> used for example in soft handover. Cooperative MIMO corresponds to transmitter <b>macro-diversity</b> or simulcasting. A simple form that does not require any advanced signal processing is single frequency networks (SFN), used especially in wireless broadcasting. SFNs combined with channel adaptive or traffic adaptive scheduling is called dynamic single frequency networks (DSFN).|$|E
50|$|A {{major issue}} in 4G systems {{is to make the}} high bit rates {{available}} in a larger portion of the cell, especially to users in an exposed position in between several base stations. In current research, this issue is addressed by <b>macro-diversity</b> techniques, also known as group cooperative relay, and also by Beam-Division Multiple Access (BDMA).|$|E
50|$|Multiple-hop networks: A {{major issue}} in systems beyond 4G {{is to make the}} high bit rates {{available}} in a larger portion of the cell, especially to users in an exposed position in between several base stations. In current research, this issue is addressed by cellular repeaters and <b>macro-diversity</b> techniques, also known as group cooperative relay, where users also could be potential cooperative nodes, thanks to the use of direct device-to-device (D2D) communication.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} DSFN implies the SFN {{grouping}} is changed dynamically over time, from timeslot to timeslot. The {{aim is to}} achieve efficient spectrum utilization for downlink unicast or multicast communication services in centrally controlled cellular systems based on for example the OFDM modulation scheme. A centralized scheduling algorithm assigns each data packet to a certain timeslot, frequency channel and group of base station transmitters. DSFN {{can be considered as}} a combination of packet scheduling, <b>macro-diversity</b> and dynamic channel allocation (DCA). The scheduling algorithm can be further extended to dynamically assign other radio resource management parameters to each timeslot and transmitter, such as modulation scheme and error correction scheme, in view to optimize the efficiency.|$|E
50|$|The {{disadvantages}} of Cooperative MIMO {{come from the}} increased system complexity and the large signaling overhead required for supporting device cooperation. The advantages of Cooperative MIMO, on the other hand, are its capability to improve the capacity, cell edge throughput, coverage, and group mobility of a wireless network in a cost-effective manner. These advantages are achieved by using distributed antennas, which can increase the system capacity by decorrelating the MIMO subchannels and allow the system to exploit the benefits of <b>macro-diversity</b> in addition to micro-diversity. In many practical applications, such as cellular mobile and wireless ad hoc networks, the advantages of deploying cooperative MIMO technology outweigh the disadvantages. In recent years, Cooperative MIMO technologies have been adopted {{into the mainstream of}} wireless communication standards.|$|E

In [10], standard performance measures of maximal ratio combining (MRC) {{in the presence of}} κ-μ fading were discussed. Analytical expressions for the switching rate of a dual branch SC in κ-μ fading were derived in [11]. <b>Macro-diversity</b> over the shadowed fading channels was discussed by several researches [7 – 9, 12]. Discussions about the second-order statistics of various diversity systems can be easily found in the literature [13 – 15]. Second-order statistics analysis of <b>macro-diversity</b> system operating over Gamma shadowed Nakagami-m fading channels was recently proposed in [16]. Moreover, to the best knowledge of the authors, no analytical study investigating the second-order statistics of <b>macro-diversity</b> system operating over Gamma shadowed κ-μ fading channel has been reported in the literature.|$|E

40|$|With the {{exponential}} growth of cellular users, {{a new generation}} of cellular networks is needed to enhance the required peak data rates. The co-channel interference between neighboring base stations inhibits peak data rate increase. To overcome this interference, multi-cell cooperation known as coordinated multipoint transmission is proposed. Such a solution makes use of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems under two different structures: Micro- and <b>macro-diversity.</b> In this paper, we study the capacity and bit error rate in cellular networks using MIMO technology. We analyse both micro- and <b>macro-diversity</b> schemes and develop a hybrid model that switches between macro- and micro-diversity in the case of hard handoff based on a cut-off range of signal-to-noise ratio values.

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} uplink goodput (bits/sec/Hz {{successfully}} decoded) and per-user packet outage in a cellular network using multi-user detection with successive interference cancellation (MUD-SIC). We consider non-ergodic fading channels where microscopic fading channel {{information is not}} available at the transmitters. As a result, packet outage occurs whenever the data rate of packet transmissions exceeds the instantaneous mutual information even if powerful channel coding is applied for protection. We are interested to study the role of <b>macro-diversity</b> (MDiv) between multiple base stations on the MUD-SIC performance where the effect of potential error-propagation during the SIC processing is taken into account. While the jointly optimal power and decoding order in the MUD-SIC are NP hard problem, we derive a simple on/off power control and asymptotically optimal decoding order {{with respect to the}} transmit power. Based on the information theoretical framework, we derive the closed-form expressions on the total system goodput as well as the per-user packet outage probability. We show that the system goodput does not scale with SNR due to mutual interference in the SIC process and <b>macro-diversity</b> (MDiv) could alleviate the problem and benefit to the system goodput...|$|E

It is shown that we can have excellent performances using only 4 bits to quantize the real and imaginary parts of the complex envelope of the received signal at the BS, with a performance close to the MFB, and although relatively simple, our analytical approach was shown to be quite accurate. Hence, these techniques are presented as an excellent approach for future broadband wireless systems employing BS cooperation schemes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{predicted}} enormous capacity gain of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{systems is}} significantly limited by co-channel interference (CCI), or by realistic outdoor propagation environments.

40|$|Wireless Sensor Network is an {{emerging}} technology that has applicationsin Wireless Actuators, remote controlling, distribution of softwareupdates {{and distribution of}} parameters to sensor nodes. This projectwork basically covers the concept of <b>macro-diversity.</b> This is a situationin which several transmitters are used for transferring the same signal (inmulti-hop sensor networks) to check the increase in connected nodes orin network coverage. Transmitter <b>macro-diversity</b> increases the receivedsignal strength and thus increases the signal-to-noise ratio which resultsin a lower outage probability. To accomplish this task three differentstrategies have been simulated using thirteen different cases.

In this project reference material has been gathered frombooks, journals and web sources; and MATLAB {{has been used as}} thesimulation tool in which codes are written in the M programming language. The algorithm works firstly by discovering all the nodes that areconnected directly with the Base Station through multi-hoping, afterwhich the second algorithm is applied to check how many more nodescan be reached by forming SFNs. A gain of up to 79 % was observedusing strategy one and strategy two and up to 83 % in strategy three. The results shows that strategy one (Forming SFNs using BroadcastingTechnique) is the best as more nodes can be reached (for different cases) than for the other two strategies (forming SFNs using uni-casting technique) ...|$|E
40|$|Under <b>macro-diversity,</b> the {{cellular}} structure is removed and each transmitter is jointly decoded by all "receivers" (base stations, or antennas {{in a single}} cell). This scheme {{has been shown to}} increase the capacity of CDMA wireless networks. However, the available macrodiversity capacity results rely on a "self-interference" approximation, which may not be appropriate in CDMA system in which the spreading gain is low for some transmitters. This is expected in 3 rd generation cellular systems. Explicitly considering power constraints, and without recurring to the above approximation, this note applies well established "fixed point" theorems to derive less conservative results defining the macrodiversity capacity region...|$|E
30|$|The {{conventional}} cellular architecture considers co-located MIMO {{and single}} cell-processing techniques. However, the problems inherent of these systems, such as shadowing, {{significant correlation between}} channels in some environments, and intercell interference, significantly degrades the capacity gains promised by MIMO techniques [4]. Thus, in a multicell environment to fully exploit the multiple antenna gain, base station (BS) cooperation is required. Such systems {{have the advantage of}} <b>macro-diversity</b> that is inherent to the widely spaced antennas and more flexibility to deal with intercell interference, which fundamentally limits the performance of user terminals (UTs) at cell edges [5, 6].

30|$|Under LTE MBMS, {{neighboring}} {{base stations}} may engage in coordinated time-synchronized point-to-multipoint transmissions. Client nodes may realize <b>macro-diversity</b> gains through selective combining or soft combining [2, 3]. Under a selective combining scheme used by MBMS over single frequency network (MBSFN), multiple MBMS group base stations may be scheduled to transmit {{the same message}} at the same time, at the same rate, using the same modulation/coding scheme (MCS), to produce MIMO-type gains at receiving client nodes. Such an MBSFN operation requires strict symbol synchronization among base stations, thus imposing spatial configurational limitations, and increasing implementational complexity and costs [2, 4, 5]. In addition to combining operations, coordinated scheduling operations can also be performed across neighboring cells to manage inter-cell interference [6, 7].|$|E
30|$|While {{short-term}} fading is mitigated {{through the}} use of diversity techniques typically at a single base station (micro-diversity), the use of such micro-diversity approaches alone will not be sufficient to mitigate the overall channel degradation when shadowing is also concurrently present. Since they coexist in wireless systems, short- and long-term fading conditions must be simultaneously taken into account. <b>Macro-diversity</b> reception is used to alleviate the effects of shadowing, where multiple signals are received at widely located base stations, ensuring that different long-term fading is experienced by these signals [7, 8]. At the macro-level, selection combining (SC) is used as a basically fast response handoff mechanism that instantaneously or, with minimal delay chooses the best base station to serve mobile based on the signal power received [9].|$|E

The new algorithm employs distributed probabilistic data association (PDA) with turbo base-station (BS) cooperations (PDA-TB). From a Bayesian point of view, we modify the original complex PDA detector {{to incorporate the}} a priori probability, which makes the complex PDA detector applicable to turbo processing: the soft information is extracted using PDA algorithm at local BS and then used as the a priori probability for further detection at neighboring BSs. Final soft decision is made after the algorithm converges. In this way, the benefit of <b>macro-diversity</b> is achieved and the inter-cell interferences are mitigated. In heavy interference condition, the proposed algorithm outperforms the distributed PDA aided soft combining (PDA-SC) and achieves the near optimal performance.

40|$|Abstract — Video {{broadcast}} and Mobile TV have received significant interests from both academia and industry recently. The emerging Mobile WiMAX (802. 16 e) {{is capable of}} providing high data rate and flexible Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms, making the support of Mobile TV very attractive. However, how to efficiently deliver video broadcast over WiMAX is not straightforward, especially in the multi-BS mode.
