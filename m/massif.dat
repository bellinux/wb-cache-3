5|$|The {{southern}} {{side of the}} <b>massif</b> lies mostly within Italy and is {{bounded by}} the Val Veny and Val Ferret whose watercourses meet just above the town of Courmayeur. From Courmayeur these waters flow southwards as the Dora Baltea towards Aosta, eventually joining the Po river. However, the extreme southwestern end of the <b>massif</b> does lie within France and is bounded by the Vallée des Glaciers (which connects to the Val Veny over the watershed of the col de la Seigne), and its waters flow southwards towards the Isère river and onwards to the Rhône. The northeastern end of the <b>massif</b> falls within Switzerland, and is bounded by a separate valley, confusingly also called Val Ferret, and which separates it from the Pennine Alps further east. Its watercourse, la Dranse de Ferret, flows northwards to join the Rhône at Martigny.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of the <b>massif</b> is covered by ice fields and is cut by {{numerous}} glaciers, mostly flowing northwestwards on the French side; southeastwards on the Italian side and eastwards on the Swiss side. With much steeper slopes on the Italian side, many glaciers drop very sharply and some, such as the Miage Glacier and the Brenva Glacier, are very heavily covered in rock debris. The <b>massif</b> is itself defined by broad valleys which formed along fault lines and which have subsequently been shaped by ice during the last glacial period of the ice age.|$|E

5|$|Level Mountain has {{experienced}} volcanic eruptions sporadically {{for the last}} 15 million years, making it the most persistent volcano of the NCVP. More than 20 eruptive centres are present on the summit and flanks of the <b>massif.</b> These have produced mainly felsic and mafic lavas, a chemical composition range typical of bimodal volcanism. Such volcanism commonly occurs at hotspots, continental rifts and leaky transform faults. The existence of olivine, orthopyroxene and spinel xenocrysts in Level Mountain basalt suggest that volcanism at the <b>massif</b> originated from the upper mantle. Hiatuses of up to a million years or more can be expected between periods of volcanic activity at Level Mountain.|$|E
5|$|The Tycho impact, which {{occurred}} between 15–20 and 70–95 million years ago, formed secondary crater clusters in various {{locations of the}} Moon. Data from the examination of these clusters suggest that the central crater cluster in the valley formed {{as a result of}} said impact. Upon analysis of known secondary impact clusters resulting from the Tycho impact, it has been discovered that the majority of them have a downrange ejecta blanket, or debris layer, with a distinctive 'birdsfoot' pattern. Apollo 17 observation data and comparison between the valley's central crater cluster and known Tycho secondary impacts shows many similarities between the two. The central crater cluster has a birdsfoot ejecta pattern that points in the direction of Tycho and the debris pattern of the light mantle points directly towards the South <b>massif.</b> The latter piece of evidence further supports the hypothesis that the light mantle formed {{as a result of an}} avalanche occurring on the aforementioned <b>massif</b> because of secondary Tycho impacts. Large-scale analysis suggests that the crater cluster may be part of a larger secondary cluster of Tycho, including craters on the North <b>massif</b> and other clusters as far north as Littrow crater. If indeed related, the smaller clusters form a large cluster that could be part of a nearby ray of Tycho.|$|E

40|$|Ten {{contiguous}} non-transform offsets (NTOs) {{along the}} Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) {{south of the}} Azores (between 38 °N and 35 ° 40 ?N) have been studied in detail using swath bathymetric, acoustic backscatter and deep-tow high-resolution sidescan sonar (TOBI) data. In contrast with discontinuities studied elsewhere at slow-spreading ridges, these left-lateral NTOs are consistently broader and larger, with complex structural fabrics accommodating the offset. They are characterized by a range of elevated and faulted <b>massifs</b> detached from their segment flanks, with an irregular acoustic backscatter pattern. Some of these <b>massifs</b> have been explored and sampled recently during dive cruises revealing that they are composed of upper mantle peridotites and lower crustal rocks, and sometimes associated with high-temperature hydrothermal venting. Water column surveys adjacent to these <b>massifs</b> show high CH 4 and low TDM (total dissolvable manganese) concentrations, possibly resulting from the process of serpentinization of ultramafic rocks. The correlation between the shallow dome-like shaped <b>massifs</b> and the high concentrations of CH 4 (associated {{with low levels of}} Mn) is of particular interest to predict the outcrop of ultramafic rocks within the NTOs where no geological data are available. The exposure of the ultramafic <b>massifs</b> within the NTOs is favored by low magmatic supply and low-angle detachment faulting occurring at segment ends. The pervasive fracturing and faulting at these discontinuities favor circulation of hydrothermal fluids and occurrence of high-temperature vent sites...|$|R
