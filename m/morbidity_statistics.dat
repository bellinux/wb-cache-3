In 2003, there were 360,000 Basotho estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS. By the end of 2008, that figure dropped to 320,000; however it only dropped to 290,000 by 2012.

The United Nations reported that in 2011 the average life span was forty-eight years, a small improvement over the 2006 estimate of forty-six years. However, with the introduction and improved accessibility of ART and {{the increasing number of}} Basotho opting for voluntary HIV testing, the annual death rate from AIDS related illnesses dropped from 29,000 in 2003 to 14,000 in 2009.
