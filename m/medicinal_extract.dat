40|$|Pterodon emarginatus Vogel (Fabaceae) is a plant {{from the}} Cerrado which is {{commonly}} known as 'sucupira branca' or 'faveiro'. It is widely used in Brazilian folk medicine for the treatment of rheumatism, sore throats and back problems. Its seeds are commercially available as they are largely used for their properties, mainly as anti-inflammatory remedy (de Moraes et al., 2012). Thus, the aim of this research was the study of Pterodon emarginatus seed extracts and essential oil, also to improve their use. For this, we performed different sets of protocols: a) the gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis to determine the sesquiterpenoid content; b) two radical-scavenging assays to determine the antioxidant activity, and 3) the MTT assay on colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (HT 29 cells) to evaluate cellular viability. Thus, the antioxidant activity was evaluated using assays based on two different mechanisms: the Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) assay, based on HAT reaction, and DPPH radical scavenging capacity assay, based on SET reaction. The DPPH assay was performed according to the method reported by Brand-Williams et al. (Brand- Williams, 1995) with some modifications (Chen et al., 2013). The ORAC assay was applied according to the method of Gillespie et al. (Gillespie, 2007), appropriately modified (Bertin et al., 2013). We also determined the Total Phenolic Content (TPC) and the Total Flavonoid Content (TFC) for each extract because these compounds are generally related to the antioxidant properties of plants.

40|$|Abstract Background Obesity, {{which is}} {{described}} as excessive or abnormal body fat, {{increases the risk of}} diet-related diseases. In Korea and around the world, the prevalence of obesity has grown annually from 1998 to 2008. This growth has continued despite various therapeutic efforts. The discovery of new and alternative treatments for obesity should be considered an important priority. Taeumjowi-tang (TJ 001), a traditional Korean <b>medicinal</b> <b>extract</b> consisting of eight herbs, is a widely used herbal remedy for obesity in Korea. However, the efficacy and safety of TJ 001 have not been fully investigated in a clinical trial. The purpose of this pilot study is to estimate obesity-related parameters and to assess the efficacy and safety of TJ 001. Methods Our study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre clinical trial of Taeumjowi-tang (TJ 001). For this study, we will recruit obese Korean patients of both sexes, ages 18 to 65 years, from four university hospitals. A total of 104 subjects will be recruited. The participants will receive either 7 g of TJ 001 or a placebo three times daily for 12 weeks. The primary end point will be the rate of subjects who lose at least 5 % of their baseline body weight. The secondary end points will be changes in body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist/hip circumference ratio, lipid profiles, body fat composition, blood pressure, fasting glucose concentration, C-reactive protein and questionnaires related to the quality of life. The outcomes will be measured every 4 weeks. The study period will be 12 weeks and will include a total of five visits with each subject (at screening and at 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks). Conclusions The results of our study will inform various estimates of TJ 001 and will {{serve as the basis for}} a larger-scale trial. This study will assess the efficacy and safety of TJ 001 as an alternative herbal remedy for obesity. Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 87153759 </p...|$|E
40|$|Hypothesis / aims of study: The overactive bladder (OAB) is {{a common}} and {{difficult}} problem to manage in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis(MS). Treatment at present is limited to anticholinergics with or without intermittent self catheterisation and most recently, intradetrusor injections of botulinum toxins. However patients using ‘street cannabis’ reported up to a 64 % improvement {{in one of the}} symptoms of OAB and an improvement was also seen in an open labelled study of patient with severe MS. More recently a subset analysis of a double blind RCT (CAMS) with oral cannabis reported improvement in urgency incontinence (1). The scientific rationale for the use of cannabis is the finding of CB 1 cannabinoid receptor on the rodent bladder and immunohistochemical endocannabinoid production in the human detrusor. This study aims to report the preliminary results of a randomised double blind parallel group placebo-controlled of the use of oromucosal cannabis based <b>medicinal</b> <b>extract</b> with constituents of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol(CBD) in a 1 : 1 mixture (2. 7 mg of THC and 2. 5 mg CBD per spray). Study design, materials and methods: 135 patients were randomised to receive either CBM or placebo (PLO) in a double blind parallel group study for eight weeks, with a two week baseline period. The study was powered to detect a difference between treatments of 0. 5 episodes of incontinence per 24 hours. Ethical approved and written informed consent was obtained for all patients. 37 Male and 98 females were recruited from 3 European countries (UK, Belgium and Romania). The primary end point for this study was the reduction in urgency incontinence episodes as evaluated by voiding diary. Secondary end points included urgency, day frequency, nocturia, bladder symptom severity score, quality of life and Patients Global Impression of Change. Intention to treat analysis and Per-Protocol analysis was utilised, as well as subgroup analysis using recognised statistical tests. Results: The primary end point i. e. reduction in numbers of daily incontinence at the end of treatment, did not reach significance. CBM was superior to placebo for nocturia (CBM - 0. 52 PLO – 0. 24, p= 0. 01). This was present at all levels of severity of nocturia and the size of effect was greater for more severe disease. Substantial numbers of patients became nocturia free on the active treatment. The patient’s opinion of bladder symptom severity (0 – 10 NRS) showed a significant difference in favour of CBM at the end of treatment (CBM - 2. 21 PLO - 1. 05, p= 0. 001). Patients on CBM were {{three times more likely to}} report an improvement of more than 30 % compared with those on placebo (P = 0. 006). The reduction in the number of daytime voids also reached significance (P = 0. 044) and the total number of voids per 24 hours was also significantly reduced (P = 0. 001). There was no difference in the volume of urine produced between the CBM and placebo groups. Patient’s global impression of change (i. e. how much better the patient felt on medication as compared to baseline) which was highly significant in favour of CBM (p = 0. 001) There was a trend in favour of improvement in Quality of Life in the treated group but this did not reach statistical significance. CBM was well tolerated. The most common adverse events were dizziness, UTI and headache and (18 % vs 7 %, 6 % vs 10 % and 8 % vs 7 % for CBM and placebo respectively). Interpretation of results: This randomised placebo controlled trial demonstrates that CBM has a major impact on bladder symptoms in patients with MS and severe urinary symptoms particularly on the nocturia and frequency. The difference that patients reported in the PGIC and bladder symptom severity scores provides strong evidence of the positive impact of CBM on their condition for the patients. None of the difference in treatment effect was due to urine volumes, as these were comparable between the two groups. Concluding message: Our results show a beneficial effect in a double blind randomised placebo controlled trial of (Sativex®) on the symptoms of overactive bladder in multiple sclerosis.

In this assay, RGC in drug free wells was set as 100  %.|$|R
40|$|It is {{estimated}} by the World Health Organization (WHO) that by 2040 neurodegenerative disorders will collectively surpass cancer as {{the primary cause of}} death in industrialised countries (WHO, 2006). Natural flora represents {{one of the most important}} therapeutic sources in modern drug discovery, however only a limited number of plant species have been screened for their neuroprotective value. The neuroprotective potential of eleven Algerian and two South African <b>medicinal</b> plant <b>extracts</b> were assessed in this study, aiming to identify promising candidates for future research. Neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease are characterised by distinct biochemical features, including protein misfolding/-aggregation, excessive oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death. As such, <b>medicinal</b> plant <b>extracts</b> were screened for biological properties directly relevant to neurodegeneration. The capacity to induce autophagy was also investigated as mounting evidence suggests that activation of this pathway may reduce abnormal protein aggregation and promote neuronal survival...|$|R
