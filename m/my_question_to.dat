6000|$|He indulgently {{shook my}} hand again, and I felt <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> be crude and my distinctions pitiful. [...] "Good-night, my dear boy--don't bother about it. After all, you do like a fellow." ...|$|R

60|$|In {{front of}} a {{glittering}} hotel a friend of mine, a critic, was climbing from a cab. He seemed at leisure; and I put <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> him. He answered me conscientiously, as I was sure he would.|$|E
6000|$|He {{shrugged his}} {{shoulders}} and then repeated <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> the Mahar spokesman. When the latter had explained in the strange sign-language that passes for speech between the Mahars and their fighting men the Sagoth turned again to me: ...|$|E

[...] "I have never seen him, for he has always kept his room overhead, since I have known Clara. But I have heard him constantly. He makes tremendous rows,--roars, and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument." [...] In looking at me and then laughing heartily, Herbert for the time recovered his usual lively manner.|$|E

For the last few months, however, we have all felt a sort of vague uneasiness one with the other. Apparently we were all still pulling the same way, yet I think that each one of us had the feeling that there was something wrong. We all began to distrust one another. To come to an end quickly, I hope I do not offend you, Miss Duge, when I say that it is my belief that your father has been and is trying to deceive us for his own benefit." ...|$|E
60|$|NAPOLEON. Psha! madam: it is {{the only}} thing that matters: the value of human life is the value of the {{greatest}} living man. Cut off that infinitesimal layer of grey matter which distinguishes my brain from that of the common man, and you cut down the stature of humanity from that of a giant to that of a nobody. I matter supremely: my soldiers do not matter at all: there are plenty more where they came from. If you kill me, or put a stop to my activity ({{it is the}} same thing), the nobler part of human life perishes. You must save the world from that catastrophe, madam. War has made me popular, powerful, famous, historically immortal. But I foresee that if I go on to the end it will leave me execrated, dethroned, imprisoned, perhaps executed. Yet if I stop fighting I commit suicide as a great man and become a common one. How am I to escape the horns of this tragic dilemma? Victory I can guarantee: I am invincible. But the cost of victory is the demoralization, the depopulation, the ruin of the victors no less than of the vanquished. How am I to satisfy my genius by fighting until I die? that is <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> you.|$|E
6000|$|Arthur Gordon {{came early}} in the day with a most urgent letter from [...] Lord Aberdeen {{addressed}} virtually to us, and urging us to join. He [...] had seen both Palmerston and Clarendon, and derived much [...] satisfaction from what they said. We met at the admiralty at [...] twelve, where Graham lay much knocked up with the fatigue and [...] anxiety of yesterday. I read to him and Lord Aberdeen Palmerston's [...] letter of to-day to me. Herbert came in and made arguments in his [...] sense. I told him I was at the point of yesterday, and was [...] immovable by considerations of the class he urged. The only [...] security worth having lies in men; the man is Lord Aberdeen; moral [...] union and association with him must continue, and must be publicly [...] known to continue. I therefore repeated <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> Lord [...] Aberdeen, whether he would in his place as a peer declare, if we [...] joined the cabinet, that it had his confidence with reference to [...] war and peace? He said, much moved, that he felt the weight of the [...] responsibility, but that after the explanation and assurances he [...] had received, he would. He was even more moved when Graham said [...] that though the leaning of his judgment was adverse, he would place [...] himself absolutely in the hands of Lord Aberdeen. To Herbert, of [...] course, it was a simple release from a difficulty. Palmerston had [...] told Cardwell, 'Gladstone feels a difficulty first infused into him [...] by Graham; Argyll and Herbert have made up their minds to do what [...] Gladstone does.' Newcastle joined us, and was in Herbert's sense. I [...] repeated again that Lord Aberdeen's declaration of confidence [...] enabled me to see my way to joining....|$|E
6000|$|... "It's rather strange," [...] remarked the lawyer, {{looking at}} him more and more distrustfully, [...] "that you should be so violently agitated, simply because <b>my</b> <b>question</b> happens <b>to</b> have hit the mark." ...|$|R
3000|$|... “I {{felt a bit}} shy and {{uneasy about}} being present “out in the open.” But I joined the hangout, asked <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> Dr. C… and it was great.

But here I was talking to somebody influential in the field, asking some basic questions and getting answers.” (Koseoglu, 2015, {{a graduate student at}} the time).|$|R
60|$|Having thus evaded <b>my</b> <b>question</b> as <b>to</b> what he {{had been}} doing, the old man went out of the tent, leaving Jerry and I gazing at each other, but not daring to speak the {{thoughts}} which were in our mind.|$|R
6000|$|I did {{not know}} then what late hours Spain kept in every way; but I {{concealed}} my surprise; and I came back at the time suggested, and offered my letter at the window with a request for ten pounds, which I fancied I might need. A clerk took the letter and scrutinized it with a deliberation which I thought it scarcely merited. His self-respect doubtless would not suffer him to betray {{that he could not}} read the English of it; and with an air of wishing to consult higher authority he carried it to another clerk at a desk across the room. To this official it seemed to come as something of a blow. Tie made a show of reading it several times over, inside and out, and then from the pigeonhole of his desk he began to accumulate what I supposed corroborative documents, or pieces justificatives. When lie had amassed a heap several inches thick, he rose and hurried out through the gate, across the hall where I sat, into a room beyond. He returned without in any wise referring himself to me and sat down at his desk again. The first clerk explained to the anxious face with which I now approached him that the second clerk had taken my letter to the director. I went back to my seat and waited fifteen minutes longer, fifteen having passed already; then I presented my anxious face, now somewhat indignant, to the first clerk again. [...] "What is the director doing with my letter?" [...] The first clerk referred <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> the second clerk, who answered from his place, [...] "He is verifying the signature." [...] "But what signature?" [...] I wondered to myself, reflecting that he had as yet had none of mine. Could it be the signature of my New York banker or my London one? I repaired once more to the window, after another wait, and said in polite but firm Castilian, [...] "Do me the favor to return me my letter." [...] A commotion of protest took place within the barrier, followed by the repeated explanation that the director was verifying the signature. I returned to toy place and considered that the suspicious document which I had presented bore record of moneys drawn in London, in Paris, in Tours, in San Sebastian, which ought to have allayed all suspicion; then for the last time I repaired to the window; more in anger now than in sorrow, and gathered nay severest Spanish together for a final demand: [...] "Do me the favor to give me back my letter without the pounds sterling." [...] The clerks consulted together; one of them decided to go to the director's room, and after a dignified delay he came back with my letter, and dashed it down before me with the only rudeness I experienced in Spain.|$|E
6000|$|The {{beautiful}} elms that shaded {{great part}} of the way massed themselves in the [...] "groves of academe" [...] at the Square, and showed pleasant glimpses of [...] "Old Harvard's scholar factories red," [...] then far fewer than now. It must have been in vacation, for I met no one as I wandered through the college yard, trying to make up my mind as to how I should learn where Lowell lived; for it was he whom I had come to find. He had not only taken the poems I sent him, but he had printed two of them in a single number of the Atlantic, and had even written me a little note about them, which I wore next my heart in my breast pocket till I almost wore it out; and so I thought I might fitly report myself to him. But I have always been helpless in finding my way, and I was still depressed by my failure to convince the horse-car driver that he had taken the wrong road. I let several people go by without questioning them, and those I did ask abashed me farther by not knowing what I wanted to know. When I had remitted my search for the moment, an ancient man, with an open mouth and an inquiring eye, whom I never afterwards made out in Cambridge, addressed me with a hospitable offer to show me the Washington Elm. I thought this would give me time to embolden myself for the meeting with the editor of the Atlantic if I should ever find him, and I went with that kind old man, who when he had shown me the tree, and the spot where Washington stood when he took command of the Continental forces, said that he had a branch of it, and that if I would come to his house with him he would give me a piece. In the end, I meant merely to flatter him into telling me where I could find Lowell, but I dissembled my purpose and pretended a passion for a piece of the historic elm, and the old man led me not only to his house but his wood-house, where he sawed me off a block so generous that I could not get it into my pocket. I feigned the gratitude which I could see that he expected, and then I took courage to put <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> him. Perhaps that patriarch lived only in the past, and cared for history and not literature. He confessed that he could not tell me where to find Lowell; but he did not forsake me; he set forth with me upon the street again, and let no man pass without asking him. In the end we met one who was able to say where Mr. Lowell was, and I found him at last in a little study at the rear of a pleasant, old-fashioned house near the Delta.|$|E

A number of changes also have taken place within library schools during this same time frame. In this series, we will talk to a SLIS faculty member and a current student to find out about today’s Indiana library schools. In this first installment, I traveled to Indiana University-Bloomington (IUB) to visit with Debora Shaw, associate dean and professor of library and information science, and Emily Cooper, first year SLIS student. <b>My</b> <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> them are in italics, with their answers following...|$|R

40|$|I {{have done}} a {{theoretical}} essay {{and to find out}} the answer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> I used literature study as my method.

I choose to have a social psychologist perspective <b>to</b> approach <b>my</b> <b>questions.</b> <b>To</b> answer the <b>questions</b> I have used a couple of researchers who a find relevant <b>to</b> answer <b>my</b> <b>questions.</b> I found Meads symbolic interactionism together with Goffmans theatremeatphor as an important theory to explain the social interaction. To explain why the destructive groups get barred from the community I have used Backers stampletheory. To describe what I think is good social work I have used Antonovskys KASAM-concept and his salutogenes-conduct. By writing this essay I have learned that groups have a great influence on the individual and destructive groups in special. The work of this essay has giving me knowledge how much theses destructive group's means to the individual and how different processes influence them...|$|R
